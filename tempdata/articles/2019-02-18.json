Boos greeted the whistle at half-time and full-time, with discontent at Sarri\u2019s substitutions spilling over in the second half of the 2-0 fifth-round defeat. A chant of \u201cfuck Sarri-ball\u201d went up from large numbers of supporters in the Matthew Harding end and there were calls for Frank Lampard\u2019s appointment. Chelsea fans eventually joined in with the United contingent\u2019s provocative refrain of \u201cYou\u2019re getting sacked in the morning\u201d. The owner, Roman Abramovich, who has not attended a game this season, was absent again and the chairman, Bruce Buck, was the most visible member of the Chelsea hierarchy in attendance. Sarri expects to report to the training ground on Tuesday to oversee preparations for the second leg of the Europa League last-32 tie against Malm\u00f6 on Thursday. The Carabao Cup final against Manchester City and a visit from Tottenham in the Premier League follow. Sarri heard the fans\u2019 chants. \u201cNot really very well but sometimes,\u201d he said. Asked if he had ever been subjected to such a scathing assessment of his footballing philosophy, he added: \u201cNo \u2013 but for everything there is a first time. I am worried about the results. Not about the fans. I can understand the situation and our fans, because the result wasn\u2019t really good. We are out of the FA Cup, so I can understand our fans. But I am worried at the moment about our results. \u201cIt\u2019s really very easy [to repair the relationship with the supporters]. If we are able to win three or four matches in a row, it will be really very easy. Am I worried about my job? No. I was really very worried when I was in League Two in Italy. Not now.\u201d United, who lost their first game under Ole Gunnar Solksj\u00e6r last week to Paris Saint-Germain, were the more aggressive team throughout, with Chelsea guilty of the same kind of sloppiness that reared up recently in heavy defeats by Bournemouth and City. \u201cI think the players are with me,\u201d Sarri said. \u201cI am not sure but I think so. I think the situation with the players is a really very good relationship but the relationship is not so important. It\u2019s important to play, it\u2019s important to get good results. \u201cIt is not my problem [whether the board still support him]. My problem is to start [preparing] for the game tomorrow morning and to work with my players to try to improve in a few days, and find more determination, more aggression. \u201cWe conceded the second goal without determination or aggression. We need all to improve because I am not able to get out of my players a very high level of aggression and determination. The same for the other leaders in the dressing room, I think.\u201d United, who lost the final to Antonio Conte\u2019s Chelsea last season but have now won seven away games in succession under Solskj\u00e6r, will travel to Wolves in the quarter-finals with momentum restored and the caretaker manager\u2019s prospects of securing the position full-time enhanced. \u201cThat was massive,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to see a reaction after PSG, and we were quite confident going into this game that we had found the right team selection and temperament. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to build on the positives. We play Liverpool next week, but Chelsea, Arsenal and us will fight for that fourth position. There are three good teams fighting for that one position. This was about getting through to the next round, not the top four.\u201d",

Offered the chance, probably all of us. After all, most of them get paid pretty well. The pay-off when you\u2019re fired after two seconds would be wonderful. But don\u2019t get too excited. Nobody likes being fired. You\u2019d actually be pretty upset. All those millions, but you\u2019d just want to get back out on the training ground again and smell the grass, lay out the cones, get involved with the banter, bark out some orders, slice some oranges. You\u2019d just want someone to refer to you as The Gaffer again. Or The Gaffa. </p> <p>The problem is nobody gets much time to do much coaching these days, especially at the highest level, which makes it hard to maintain a sense of perspective when things aren\u2019t going to plan. Everybody wants success and everybody wants it now. The demands simply grow louder, more intense and harder to ignore, because we all need to Have Our Say, which is how we get ourselves into the situation where this FA Cup tie between Chelsea and Manchester United is being billed in some quarters as an audition for the managers of both teams to prove that they deserve to still be in a job this time next week.</p> <p>That\u2019s right: it\u2019s another episode of Fraud! Maurizio Sarri\u2019s in the blue corner and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s in the red. This isn\u2019t simply a fifth-round tie between two of the biggest teams in England. It\u2019s so much more than that. For Chelsea, it\u2019s about offering absolute vindication that Sarriball can work in English football. For United, a chance to show that Solskjaer truly is the next coming of Sir Alex Ferguson. Unless he follows up last week\u2019s disappointment against PSG with <em>another</em> defeat. In which case he should be put on the first plane back to Molde, leaving United free to install Paul Ince, Steve Bruce or Mark Hughes in his place.</p> <p>You know, maybe it\u2019s all getting a little bit out of hand. Maybe there are too many snap judgements. Maybe we need more patience. Maybe, if Chelsea are going to hire a manager as process oriented as Sarri, they need to give him the right players. Maybe they need to make sure he has a proper pre-season before his first year in a new country. Maybe they need to realise that sometimes you have to suffer for the success, even if it means gritting their teeth through dismal away defeats to Manchester City and Bournemouth.</p> <p>But if Chelsea lose this game, that might be it for Sarri. In fact, with the possibility of another hammering against City in Sunday\u2019s Carabao Cup final against a serious prospect, he might be toast even if Chelsea make it to the last eight of the FA Cup at United\u2019s expense. Both sides need to compromise. Maybe Sarri needs to focus a little more on defending at the moment and lower his reliance on Jorginho. Maybe he just needs a few results. To hell with the process! Philosophy be damned!<br></p> <p>Is that the way to go, though? Sometimes you learn more in defeat, even if the lessons aren\u2019t always clear at the time. Money can lead to short-term success, but it\u2019s no guarantee of sustainability. United have been proof of that since Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s retirement. They\u2019ve chased stars, splurged money up the wall, made a series of ill-considered managerial appointments, and it\u2019s brought them a couple of trophies here and there, but none of it\u2019s really worked. </p> <p>Jose Mourinho was wrong about a lot of things, but he was right in thinking that there isn\u2019t enough football knowledge in the corridors of power at Old Trafford. That\u2019s why it\u2019s harsh to blame Solskjaer for United\u2019s defeat to PSG and unfair to say he needs to prove himself right here, right now, otherwise give the job to Mauricio Pochettino in the summer. Football isn\u2019t always so black and white. Sometimes it\u2019s just nice to wait and see what happens next. </p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 7.30pm GMT.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-18T18:23:17.105Z\">at 6.23pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s time to wrap up this MBM. Another fine win for Manchester United, but it could be curtains for Maurizio Sarri at Chelsea. Maybe not this week, but it\u2019s hard to see the Italian keeping his job if they lose the Carabao Cup final to Manchester City on Sunday. It was another drab performance from Chelsea. Dominic Fifield has the full story \u2026 Paul Pogba speaks! \u201cIt was a beautiful win. A great performance from the team. It wasn\u2019t easy but we did it and we are really pleased. The team helped me to get to my best. They help me to score goals and make assists. If he doesn\u2019t make the run I can\u2019t play the ball. We are Manchester United and we play to win trophies. The manager trusts us and we trust him. We play to win\u201d Ander Herrera speaks! \u201cThey have a fantastic team so we had to fight until the end. I played a more offensive role because we knew they are struggling at this end of the bench. I would like to speak about Alexis, Andreas and Scott, the way they came into the game. A world class player like Alexis, the way he fought, this is Manchester United.\u201d Follow the FA Cup quarter-final here. While Chelsea wallow in the misery of another poor performance, Manchester United celebrate reaching the last eight of the FA Cup. They played very well indeed and took control with splendid first-half goals from Ander Herrera and Paul Pogba, who continues to make Jose Mourinho look very silly indeed. It\u2019s a huge statement from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who\u2019s responded brilliantly to last week\u2019s defeat to PSG. It\u2019s increasingly hard to see them giving the job to someone else. The Chelsea fans greet the final whistle with a very loud boo. Farewell, Maurizio. 90 min+4: United make their final change, Scott McTominay replacing the excellent Marcus Rashford. 90 min+2: Zappacosta lobs a cross to the far post. Hazard heads high and wide. 90 min+1: There will be five added minutes. Marcos Alonso tries to score with an overhead kick. That\u2019s not happening tonight. The ball dribbles behind for a goal-kick. 89 min: Chelsea are well and truly beaten. The fans who haven\u2019t left yet are only staying so they can do a very loud boo at full-time. 85 min: Bet Callum Hudson-Odoi\u2019s relieved he wasn\u2019t allowed to join Bayern Munich. The Chelsea fans aren\u2019t staying put, though. They\u2019re voting with their feet and are making for the exits already. 84 min: JT for manager! 82 min: Loud boos greet Chelsea\u2019s final change, which sees Davide Zappacosta replace Cesar Azpilicueta. Zappacosta! I\u2019d forgotten he existed. This is a total shambles. 81 min: United have had this game under lock and key since Ander Herrera scored the opening goal. Chelsea\u2019s response has been feeble. What chance Sarri going before the League Cup final against Manchester City? 80 min: \u201cHave you ever been to Chicago?\u201d JR in Illinois says. \u201cDid you know that if you were to go to Chicago and you ordered a hot dog and you put ketchup on it they would throw you in jail? It\u2019s true. If you put ketchup on a hot dog in Chicago you will be arrested and put in jail. Really, you could go to any restaurant or hot dog stand and say \u201cI\u2019d like a hot dog and please put some ketchup on it\u201d and they would call the police and you would be arrested and then you\u2019d be put in jail.\u201d 79 min: Jose Mourinho is available. 78 min: \u201cYou\u2019re getting sacked in the morning!\u201d the Chelsea fans chant. Poor Maurizio. What\u2019s Guus Hiddink up to? 76 min: United make their second change, Andreas Pereira replacing the excellent Juan Mata, who receives warm applause from both set of fans. 75 min: Sanchez is involved straight away, barrelling through on the right and seeing his shot blocked. 73 min: Alexis Sanchez replaces Romelu Lukaku. It\u2019s ketchup time! 72 min: \u201cFuck Sarriball!\u201d the Chelsea fans chant. Oh dear. 71 min: Willian wafts the free-kick miles over. There\u2019s a funereal atmosphere inside Stamford Bridge. That said, the home fans perk up a little when they see that Mateo Kovacic\u2019s number\u2019s up. Ross Barkley replaces the Croatian. It\u2019s a like for like swap from Sarri, who remains wedded to The System. Such inflexibility, sadly, is probably going to work against him. 69 min: Hazard dribbles through the middle and wins a free-kick off Herrera. Willian fancies this. It\u2019s made for him. 65 min: VAR are having a look at a possible Chelsea penalty. Did Smalling pull Rudiger down at that corner? Answer: no. 64 min: Eden Hazard suddenly comes to life, bursting on to a long throw down the right, swivelling inside and preparing to blast past Romero, only for Lindelof to divert his shot just over! United get the corner away. Again. 62 min: United win a corner on the right. It\u2019s a waste of time. 60 min: Rudiger\u2019s booked for flattening Mata from behind. 58 min: Chelsea make their first change. Willian replaces Pedro. 57 min: ... which comes to nothing. Again. 56 min: Kante slips a clever pass through to Pedro, but Shaw stretches to push the ball away from the Chelsea winger. Shaw manages to collide with Romero in the process. They both stay down for a while, but get up eventually. Romero\u2019s rubbing his bruised stomach. He looks winded, but he\u2019s ready for this Chelsea corner... 54 min: United deal with a couple of Chelsea corners. This is all very drab from the home side. 53 min: Chelsea win a corner on the right. \u201cDon\u2019t think I heard you mention Lukaku in the first half,\u201d Duncan Edwards says. \u201cWith penalties looming surely Solskj\u00e6r will give S\u00e1nchez a squeeze before too long.\u201d 52 min: Already on a booking, Matic commits two fouls in quick succession, the first on Hazard, the second on Kante. Chelsea scream for a second booking for their former midfielder, but Kevin Friend won\u2019t oblige. United might want to think about taking Matic off, though. His next foul could spell an early bath. 49 min: Chelsea\u2019s corner\u2019s cleared, Kante swipes at a poor shot and United break, Rashford storming down the left, tying Azpilicueta in knots and trying to slip a pass across to Lukaku at the end of a lightning counter. David Luiz steps in to clear, though. The ball bounces off Azpilicueta\u2019s shoulder and Chelsea survive. 48 min: This is better from Chelsea, though, Higuain tiptoeing into the area from the right and seeing a shot deflected behind for a corner. 47 min: Stamford Bridge is very flat. At the moment it feels hard to see Sarri getting a reaction from the crowd and this team. 46 min: Chelsea get the second half underway. While the United fans cheer their team down the tunnel, the home fans let out a few half-hearted boos. Maurizio Sarri is in a spot of bother here, but he can\u2019t have any complaints about the score. Chelsea are being outplayed. See you in 15 minutes! 45 min+1: Two minutes of the added stuff. The home fans are very quiet. Another ruthless goal from Manchester United and Chelsea are in huge trouble. Rashford storms down the right, Alonso nowhere to be seen, and whips a Beckham-esque cross into the middle. This time it\u2019s Pogba making the goalscoring run, powering on to the delivery, leaping powerfully and ramming a low header past Kepa, who couldn\u2019t get strong enough hands on the ball! As for Chelsea\u2019s centre-backs, they were totally overwhelmed by Pogba\u2019s brilliance and athleticism. Paul Pogba is good at football! Who knew? 43 min: Chelsea work United over on the right, creating the overload for Azpilicueta, but Lindelof blocks the right-back\u2019s cross. 41 min: Hazard\u2019s down after being caught by Rashford, that infamous hatchet man. Hazard gets back to his feet, but he\u2019s wincing a bit. 40 min: Chelsea have had 58% possession. Make of that what you will. 38 min: Hazard\u2019s flick runs through to Higuain, who has space after a flick from Smalling. All of a sudden United are in trouble - until Shaw races cross to block Higuain\u2019s path to goal. Hazard picks up possession on the left of the area, but he doesn\u2019t have room to do anything of note. 35 min: Pedro\u2019s cross from the right causes Romero a problem and almost dips inside the far post. Not quite, though. United goal-kick. 33 min: \u201cOle, Ole, Ole...\u201d chant the noisy United fans. They\u2019re loving this state of affairs. This is a very good goal from Manchester United\u2019s perspective. Juan Mata\u2019s at the heart of a neat passing move, with Chelsea failing to put the playmaker under enough pressure. The Spaniard finds Pogba on the left and the Frenchman\u2019s given the room to curl a fine ball into the middle, where Ander Herrera peels away from Marcos Alonso and heads past Kepa from close range! Pogba is good at football. Who knew? Sarri out! 30 min: Smalling\u2019s managed to rip David Luiz\u2019s shirt. How rude. 29 min: A lull. 25 min: Azpilicueta knocks a pass back to Kepa. Instead of booting clear, the goalkeeper takes a touch. It isn\u2019t a great one and he has to hack the ball away with Rashford closing in fast. Just stick it in the fahkin\u2019 mixah! 23 min: Hazard darts to the byline on the left, but Romero dives to claim the cross. 21 min: Young, attempting to exert a high press as Chelsea look to pass out from the back, steams into the back of Pedro on the right. He\u2019s booked. 19 min: Rashford tries to outdo David Luiz with a free-kick from the left, but he raps it straight at Kepa, who deals with a challenging bounce. 17 min: Another chance for Chelsea, Azpilicueta crossing from the right, Higuain nutting just wide from 15 yards. He was unmarked and will feel he should have done better. 16 min: The much-maligned Jorginho shows what he can do with a precise ball over the top from deep. United have been sliced open. Higuain plucks the ball out of the sky with a magnificent piece of control. Yet his second touch forces him wide and he doesn\u2019t have the space to squeeze the ball home. 15 min: United have had their warning: they aren\u2019t going to get away with kicking Hazard out of the game. Matic is booked for bringing the Chelsea forward down. 14 min: This is a good, open game. Herrera strides through the middle and lashes one goalwards from 25 yards, forcing Kepa to fly to his left and push the ball away. 12 min: Chelsea have stirred. To put it another way, Hazard has stirred. He zips inside from the left and combines with Alonso, but his curling shot from 18 yards flashes just wide. That was more like it from Chelsea: quick, snappy football putting United under pressure and almost leading to the opening goal. 11 min: David Luiz moves up to the ball and uses his instep to send a wobbling, vicious effort towards the left corner. Romero has to watch it carefully and parry smartly. The rebound falls to Pedro, who smashes an awkward volley straight at United\u2019s goalkeeper, who does brilliantly to hold it. 10 min: Kovacic falls to the turf after a hand in the face from Herrera. The United midfielder claims it was accidental, but Chelsea get a free-kick 25 yards out. It\u2019s quite far to the left of the D, but David Luiz fancies a shot. 9 min: A free-kick to United on the right. They take it quickly, but it\u2019s headed away. Moments later, Matic pings a lovely ball over the top to Smalling, who\u2019s still up from the back. It\u2019s a free header, but Smalling heads straight at Kepa. 6 min: Chelsea\u2019s first attack ends with Romero fielding Pedro\u2019s low cross. \u201cGiven the horrific cup jinx Chelsea have had on United for what seems like 2000 years, I\u2019m only hoping we can get to penalties,\u201d says Duncan Edwards. \u201cThat\u2019s because I feel Romero has saved more over the years than de Gea. But without any actual stats it may be no more than a feeling.\u201d 4 min: United have started well. Chelsea have the whiff of a wounded team. They\u2019ve fallen deep already. When they struggle to get the ball away from their own area, Pogba tees up Lukaku for a volley, but the striker wallops it miles over from 15 yards. 2 min: United are on the attack straight away, Mata creeping behind Jorginho and finding Lukaku on the left. The Belgian\u2019s low cross has to be put behind by a sliding David Luiz at the near post. Marcus Rashford was waiting in the six-yard box. The corner comes to nothing. Peep! An embrace between the two managers, some photographs with the mascots, and then we\u2019re off! Manchester United, kicking from left to right in the first half, get us underway. Before we begin, a minute\u2019s applause for Gordon Banks. \u201cEngland\u2019s No1!\u201d is the chant at Stamford Bridge. Here come the teams! Chelsea in blue, Manchester United in red. This, of course, was the final last year. Chelsea won that and they also knocked out in the quarters two years ago, N\u2019Golo Kante scoring the only goal against 10-man United, who spent the game trying to kick Eden Hazard. The Londoners have generally dominated this fixture in recent years. United haven\u2019t won here in any competition since 2012. \u201cSolskjaer has had a commendable interim reign so far, but comparing Sanchez\u2019s goal-scoring to a repressed bottle of ketchup shows that his analogy skills don\u2019t yet cut the mustard at the top, top level,\u201d Peter Oh says. \u201cIn my experience, squeezing a bottle of ketchup more often than not results in flatulent noises and a spattering of watery red mess.\u201d \u201cThis line-up again?\u201d Benjamin Park says. \u201cOh, for the love of God, change something, anything! Even if it\u2019s just Luiz\u2019s hairstyle. This ain\u2019t deja vu, this is Groundhog Day.\u201d I suppose the big question is this: what does Mateo Kovacic do in this team? \u201cIf Solskjaer is to prove himself the second coming of Ferguson then he should have disrespected the cup and picked a side featuring seven kids and four cardboard cutouts,\u201d Ian Copestake says. Or maybe he could have taken them to Brazil. That was a joke. Don\u2019t bite me. Pre-match reading A reminder: VAR is in use for this game and there will also be extra-time and penalties if it ends in a draw. No replay! The quarter-final draw will also take place once this is over. Chelsea start in their Sarri-approved 4-3-3. Antonio Rudiger, Marcos Alonso, N\u2019Golo Kante, Eden Hazard and Gonzalo Higuain replaces Andreas Christensen, Emerson Palmieri, Ross Barkley, Willian and Olivier Giroud, all of whom make way after deputising in last Thursday\u2019s away win against Malmo in the Europa League. Manchester United make four changes after last week\u2019s defeat to PSG. Sergio Romero starts in goal instead of the rested David De Gea and Chris Smalling replaces Eric Bailly, while Romelu Lukaku and Juan Mata come in for the injured pair of Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard. We\u2019ll have to wait to see if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can squeeze any ketchup out of Alexis Sanchez, who starts on the bench. Chelsea: Kepa; Azpilicueta, David Luiz, Rudiger, Alonso; Jorginho, Kante, Kovacic; Pedro, Higuain, Hazard. Subs: Caballero, Christensen, Zappacosta, Hudson-Odoi, Barkley, Willian Giroud. Manchester United: Romero; Young, Lindelof, Smalling, Shaw; Matic, Herrera, Pogba; Mata, Lukaku, Rashford. Subs: De Gea, Bailly, Dalot, Fred, McTominay, Pereira, Sanchez. Referee: Kevin Friend. Hello. Who\u2019d be a football manager in 2019, eh? Offered the chance, probably all of us. After all, most of them get paid pretty well. The pay-off when you\u2019re fired after two seconds would be wonderful. But don\u2019t get too excited. Nobody likes being fired. You\u2019d actually be pretty upset. All those millions, but you\u2019d just want to get back out on the training ground again and smell the grass, lay out the cones, get involved with the banter, bark out some orders, slice some oranges. You\u2019d just want someone to refer to you as The Gaffer again. Or The Gaffa. The problem is nobody gets much time to do much coaching these days, especially at the highest level, which makes it hard to maintain a sense of perspective when things aren\u2019t going to plan. Everybody wants success and everybody wants it now. The demands simply grow louder, more intense and harder to ignore, because we all need to Have Our Say, which is how we get ourselves into the situation where this FA Cup tie between Chelsea and Manchester United is being billed in some quarters as an audition for the managers of both teams to prove that they deserve to still be in a job this time next week. That\u2019s right: it\u2019s another episode of Fraud! Maurizio Sarri\u2019s in the blue corner and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s in the red. This isn\u2019t simply a fifth-round tie between two of the biggest teams in England. It\u2019s so much more than that. For Chelsea, it\u2019s about offering absolute vindication that Sarriball can work in English football. For United, a chance to show that Solskjaer truly is the next coming of Sir Alex Ferguson. Unless he follows up last week\u2019s disappointment against PSG with another defeat. In which case he should be put on the first plane back to Molde, leaving United free to install Paul Ince, Steve Bruce or Mark Hughes in his place. You know, maybe it\u2019s all getting a little bit out of hand. Maybe there are too many snap judgements. Maybe we need more patience. Maybe, if Chelsea are going to hire a manager as process oriented as Sarri, they need to give him the right players. Maybe they need to make sure he has a proper pre-season before his first year in a new country. Maybe they need to realise that sometimes you have to suffer for the success, even if it means gritting their teeth through dismal away defeats to Manchester City and Bournemouth. But if Chelsea lose this game, that might be it for Sarri. In fact, with the possibility of another hammering against City in Sunday\u2019s Carabao Cup final against a serious prospect, he might be toast even if Chelsea make it to the last eight of the FA Cup at United\u2019s expense. Both sides need to compromise. Maybe Sarri needs to focus a little more on defending at the moment and lower his reliance on Jorginho. Maybe he just needs a few results. To hell with the process! Philosophy be damned! Is that the way to go, though? Sometimes you learn more in defeat, even if the lessons aren\u2019t always clear at the time. Money can lead to short-term success, but it\u2019s no guarantee of sustainability. United have been proof of that since Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s retirement. They\u2019ve chased stars, splurged money up the wall, made a series of ill-considered managerial appointments, and it\u2019s brought them a couple of trophies here and there, but none of it\u2019s really worked. Jose Mourinho was wrong about a lot of things, but he was right in thinking that there isn\u2019t enough football knowledge in the corridors of power at Old Trafford. That\u2019s why it\u2019s harsh to blame Solskjaer for United\u2019s defeat to PSG and unfair to say he needs to prove himself right here, right now, otherwise give the job to Mauricio Pochettino in the summer. Football isn\u2019t always so black and white. Sometimes it\u2019s just nice to wait and see what happens next. Kick-off: 7.30pm GMT.",

It is clear that England now has that situation. It is like a wave with one country a little bit up and another country down.\u201d</p>",

Klopp concurs, although he does not believe the Bundesliga has a lasting problem. \u201cThere is no dip,\u201d he added. \u201cSix or seven years ago you had all these boys coming up \u2013 Marco Reus, Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle, Mario G\u00f6tze, Thomas M\u00fcller, Mats Hummels \u2013 and it was clear when they became Under\u201121 European champions it would be a generation of proper quality. It is clear that England now has that situation. It is like a wave with one country a little bit up and another country down.\u201d",

The home affairs department used a limited tender process with only one bidder to pick relatively obscure companies in both major contracts. Canstruct International, a Brisbane-based firm and Liberal donor, reportedly had limited experience running garrison and welfare services when it bid for a lucrative government contract to run the Nauru detention centre in 2017. Its previous work was almost all civil construction and infrastructure projects, though it had worked on projects on Nauru, including to rebuild the detention centre following riots in 2013. The government struggled to find anyone who wanted the Nauru contract, and awarded the deal to Canstruct in a limited tender with no other bidders. Canstruct was awarded $8m initially through a letter of intent. The process has raised comparisons with the Paladin case, which continued to pile pressure on the government this week. On Monday, Mike Pezzullo, the head of the department of home affairs, told a Senate estimates committee that the department was \u201cdealing with an urgent situation\u201d in awarding the contract to provide services on Manus Island \u201cbut we were never desperate\u201d. The director of legal advocacy at the Human Rights Legal Centre, Keren Adams, said the Canstruct and Paladin cases raised serious questions about the department\u2019s handling of the offshore detention contracts. \u201cCanstruct, like Paladin, had next to no relevant experience when they were awarded the Nauru contract,\u201d Adams told Guardian Australia. \u201cOne day they were building tunnels and the next they were managing welfare services for a group of highly vulnerable and traumatised people. Adams said that as mainstream companies have increasingly distanced themselves from the \u201cabject cruelty\u201d of offshore detention, the government was having to cast the net wider to find contractors on Nauru and Manus. The lucrative deal has helped propel Canstruct, based in the Brisbane suburb of Yeerongpilly, into wealth. Its latest filings with the corporate regulator revealed a $43m profit in seven months running the centre. Human rights lawyers believe the company could make $110m profit by the time the contract expires at the end of April. Canstruct\u2019s contract was initially scheduled to end in October as the Nauru government took over the running of the regional processing centre, but it was extended to April amid multiple reports the Nauru government was not ready. In August the Nauruan government legislated the creation of a Nauruan RPC corporation in anticipation of the takeover, which has a three-person board appointed by cabinet to procure and manage all services. At the same time it passed amendments which transferred the power to make agreements with service providers from the secretary of justice and border control to the administrative head of the department of multicultural affairs. The latter role is held by Barina Waqa \u2013 daughter of the Nauruan president, Baron Waqa. In October the Nauruan government legislated for all revenue which came through the RPC corporation \u2013 by then known to be the wholly state-owned Eigigu Solutions \u2013 to be held separately to treasury funds, and for it to be released on the joint approval of secretary and minister of multicultural affairs. In November, when Canstruct\u2019s contract was extended for six months, the Nauruan government passed a regulation exempting Eigigu Solutions from \u201cmanagement and service fees for the facilitation and administration of services\u201d which it had previously required Canstruct pay to the government. The bill was $20m for Canstruct\u2019s first 12 months and $10m for its extra six months. There is no suggestion that Canstruct, a firm with 500 staff and contractors, is not providing proper garrison or welfare services, or that commonwealth procurement rules were breached. But the use of another limited tender by the Department of Home Affairs for a major contract adds to criticism of the way it is handling contracted work in Australia\u2019s offshore detention centres. Questioned about the Canstruct contract in Senate estimates in 2017, the head of home affairs, Michael Pezzullo, conceded that \u201cyou should always go for an open tender\u201d, unless there were \u201cexigencies\u201d. Other officials explained that the department had previously tested the market and found no one willing to do the work on Nauru, other than Canstruct. \u201cWe\u2019ve made expressions of interest in addition to having gone to tender and there was nobody else in the market that was actually interested in the contract,\u201d Mandy Newton, a home affairs department deputy commissioner, told Senate estimates in 2017. \u201cSo we went directly to Canstruct.\u201d Cheryl-Anne Moy, a senior home affairs executive, told Senate estimates on Monday that it was difficult to find companies willing to work at regional processing centres. In answering questions about the Paladin contract in the first half of 2017, Moy referred to previous experiences taking expressions of interest to market. \u201cThe number of people that replied to those tenders was limited and primarily the people who decided not to tender \u2013 who expressed some interest early in and then decided they wouldn\u2019t tender \u2013 gave us the reason there was too much noise for their organisations and international companies around regional processing.\u201d The Canstruct deal was struck not long after the auditor general had criticised the department for the way it handled its contracts on Nauru and Manus Island, saying it \u201chas fallen well short of effective contract management practice\u201d. Archived versions of Canstruct\u2019s website immediately before the awarding of the Nauru contract show it referred to itself as a \u201ccivil engineering and building company\u201d. Evidence to Senate estimates suggests Canstruct had previously donated to a Liberal-linked fundraising entity, Forward Business Leadership. The body was an associated entity of the Queensland Liberal National Party. In response to a series of questions, Canstruct included a single-line response clarifying the nature of the donation. \u201cThe donation referred to was made over 10 years ago for a local council campaign,\u201d the company said. Pezzullo said in 2017 that such donations would not necessarily bar a company from the tender under the commonwealth procurement guidelines. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s any prohibition per se,\u201d he told estimates. \u201cMost of these matters are always managed at arms-length from ministers.

Thanks for reading and commenting \u2013 here\u2019s a summary of the afternoon\u2019s events:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>After seven Labour MPs resigned, the Parliamentary Labour Party held a \u201cheated\u201d meeting.</strong> Some MPs concerned by the party\u2019s handling of the issue of antisemitism left the meeting unconvinced by the speech given by the chairman, Ian Lavery. \u201cHe gave me no reassurance at all that the Labour party would deal with it in the proper way,\u201d said one. The deputy leader, Tom Watson, said the party needed to change if it wants to avoid more resignations. \u201cI love this party but sometimes I no longer recognise it,\u201d he said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Four cabinet ministers demanded the prime minister stop using the threat of no deal as a negotiating tactic.</strong> A report suggested some ministers were willing to resign from the government over the issue, while another indicated one was willing to join a new political party set up the seven MPs who left Labour this morning.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said those seven should stand down and fight byelections.</strong> \u201cAll of these MPs stood on our manifesto in 2017 \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s manifesto. They all increased their majorities. Now they\u2019re on a different platform so the honourable thing, the usual thing for them to do now, is for them to stand down and fight by-elections back in their constituencies.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> \n   <li><strong>Within hours of resigning from the Labour party, in part over its response to racism allegations, Angela Smith apologised for referring to people of a \u201cfunny tinge\u201d.</strong> She said: \u201cI\u2019m very sorry about any offence caused and I\u2019m very upset that I misspoke so badly. It\u2019s not what I am. I am committed to fighting racism wherever I find it in our society.\u201d<br></li> \n   <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/18/several-labour-mps-set-to-quit-the-party-politics-live?page=with:block-5c6aa9afe4b022557d2470b0#block-5c6aa9afe4b022557d2470b0\">For a summary of the day\u2019s earlier events, see here.</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s all from us this evening.

Two Scottish Labour MPs, Ian Murray in Edinburgh South and Martin Whitfield in East Lothian, already back the proposal.</p> \n  <p>Many Scottish Labour figures believe Corbyn\u2019s pro-Brexit stance will cost the party seats and votes at the next general election, with the Scottish National party the most likely to benefit.</p> \n  <p>Dugdale said that over the weekend Paul Sweeney, the widely-tipped Labour MP for Glasgow North East and Ged Killen, the MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, also supported a second referendum. Killen resigned from his frontbench role as a parliamentary aide last year over Corbyn\u2019s Brexit stance.</p> \n  <p>That suggests Richard Leonard, Dugdale\u2019s successor as Scottish leader, faces deepening splits on Europe even though no Scottish Labour parliamentarians have so far backed the new breakaway group.</p> \n  <p>Leonard implied the breakaway group could make it harder for Labour to defeat the Tories. He said in a statement:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When young people are fighting for action on climate change, it is time to come together for the future, not divide. The Tory party\u2019s failed solutions represent a dead end. We must do nothing to let them off the hook.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Dugdale, who resigned as Scottish leader in 2017 partly because of her deep differences with Corbyn, distanced herself from the breakaway group on Monday by insisting she still wanted to see a Labour government. But she added:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I believe there\u2019s a majority of Labour MSPs in the parliament who would back a final say [on Brexit] but crucially over the weekend you saw a big development in the Scottish parliamentary Labour group with Paul Sweeney saying he would back having a final say.</p> \n   <p> That means a majority of Scottish Labour MPs back it too so the momentum towards a people\u2019s vote is growing in the Labour party and as a consequence I think the likelihood of a people\u2019s vote across the country is also increasing. I have never been more optimistic about a people\u2019s vote taking place than I am today.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-18T16:20:43.033Z\">at 4.20pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c6ad449e4b03c0232353051\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-18T16:00:06.763Z\">4.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Angela Smith apologises for \"funny tinge\" comment</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Angela Smith has apologised for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/18/several-labour-mps-set-to-quit-the-party-politics-live?page=with:block-5c6abf0ae4b0bdb6048fe122#block-5c6abf0ae4b0bdb6048fe122\">comments she made during a TV debate about racism</a>. </p> \n  <p>Appearing on the BBC\u2019s Politics Live programme today, Smith appeared to talk about people being a \u201cfunny tinge\u201d. \u201cThe recent history of the party I\u2019ve just left suggested it\u2019s not just about being black or a funny tin ... you know, a different... from the BAME community,\u201d she said.</p> \n  <p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/angelasmithmp/status/1097518807357288448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1097518807357288448&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Forder-order.com%2F2019%2F02%2F18%2Fangela-smith-posts-grovelling-funny-tinge-apology-video%2F\">a video statement</a>, Smith said: \u201cI\u2019ve seen the clip from Politics Live.

Seven MPs have left the Labour party and announced they will form a new independent group in parliament. They said they were disgusted by the party\u2019s handling of anti-semitism and its Brexit policy. People have speculated that this might happen ever since Corbyn\u2019s 2015 leadership win and now it finally has. </p> \n  <p>The MPs are \u2013</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Chuka Umunna, MP for Streatham and former shadow business secretary. </li> \n   <li>Luciana Berger, MP for Liverpool Wavertree and former shadow minister for mental health.</li> \n   <li>Gavin Shuker, MP for Luton South and former shadow international development minister.</li> \n   <li>Angela Smith, MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge and former shadow deputy leader of the House of Commons.</li> \n   <li>Chris Leslie, MP Nottingham East and former shadow chancellor. </li> \n   <li>Mike Gapes, MP for Ilford South and former chair of the foreign affairs select committee.</li> \n   <li> Ann Coffey, MP for Stockport and former parliamentary private secretary to Alistair Darling when he was chancellor of the exchequer.<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>The group is not yet a political party, although they said at the press conference earlier that they could develop into one over time.

Today, visceral hatreds of other people, views and opinions are common-place in and around the Labour Party. </p> \n   <p> It is not simply that our values are no longer welcome in the Labour Party; the values we hold mean that, in all conscience, we can have no confidence in the party\u2019s collective leadership, competence or culture. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Values \u2013</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Britain works best as a diverse, mixed social market economy, in which well-regulated private enterprise can reward aspiration and drive economic progress and where government has the responsibility to ensure the sound stewardship of taxpayers\u2019 money and a stable, fair and balanced economy; </p> \n   <p> A strong economy means we can invest in our public services. We believe the collective provision of public services and the NHS can be delivered through government action, improving health and educational life chances, protecting the public, safeguarding the vulnerable, ensuring dignity at every stage of life and placing individuals at the heart of decision-making.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>...</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The barriers of poverty, prejudice and discrimination facing individuals should be removed and advancement occur on the basis of merit, with inequalities reduced through the extension of opportunity, giving individuals the skills and means to open new doors and fulfil their ambitions. </p> \n   <p> Individuals are capable of taking responsibility if opportunities are offered to them, everybody can and should make a contribution to society and that contribution should be recognised. Paid work should be secure and pay should be fair. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>...</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In order to face the challenges and opportunities presented by globalisation, migration and technological advances, we believe the multilateral, international rules-based order must be strengthened and reformed. We believe in maintaining strong alliances with our closest European and international allies on trade, regulation, defence, security and counter-terrorism. </p> \n   <p> As part of the global community we have a responsibility to future generations to protect our environment, safeguard the planet, plan development sustainably and to act on the urgency of climate change. </p> \n   <p> Power should be devolved to the most appropriate level, trusting and involving local communities.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now. Thanks for reading and commenting \u2013 here\u2019s a summary of the afternoon\u2019s events: After seven Labour MPs resigned, the Parliamentary Labour Party held a \u201cheated\u201d meeting. Some MPs concerned by the party\u2019s handling of the issue of antisemitism left the meeting unconvinced by the speech given by the chairman, Ian Lavery. \u201cHe gave me no reassurance at all that the Labour party would deal with it in the proper way,\u201d said one. The deputy leader, Tom Watson, said the party needed to change if it wants to avoid more resignations. \u201cI love this party but sometimes I no longer recognise it,\u201d he said. Four cabinet ministers demanded the prime minister stop using the threat of no deal as a negotiating tactic. A report suggested some ministers were willing to resign from the government over the issue, while another indicated one was willing to join a new political party set up the seven MPs who left Labour this morning. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said those seven should stand down and fight byelections. \u201cAll of these MPs stood on our manifesto in 2017 \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s manifesto. They all increased their majorities. Now they\u2019re on a different platform so the honourable thing, the usual thing for them to do now, is for them to stand down and fight by-elections back in their constituencies.\u201d Within hours of resigning from the Labour party, in part over its response to racism allegations, Angela Smith apologised for referring to people of a \u201cfunny tinge\u201d. She said: \u201cI\u2019m very sorry about any offence caused and I\u2019m very upset that I misspoke so badly. It\u2019s not what I am. I am committed to fighting racism wherever I find it in our society.\u201d For a summary of the day\u2019s earlier events, see here. That\u2019s all from us this evening. If you\u2019d like to read more, my colleagues Rowena Mason and Jessica Elgot have this: MPs leaving tonight\u2019s meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party said Ian Lavery had praised the party\u2019s manifesto and its popularity and vociferously denied the party was institutionally antisemitic. Many felt the robust response had misjudged the atmosphere. According to Louise Ellman: [Lavery] said he was disappointed with them (the MPs who resigned). I didn\u2019t feel there was reflection or action at all... he gave me no reassurance at all that the Labour party would deal with it in the proper way ... To me, he made it worse, virtually everyone who spoke was outraged. Ellman said she would not be leaving the party herself. I\u2019m just as concerned as all the people who left this morning are, but I\u2019m going to carry on and try and fight this from within the party. Stella Creasy said the MPs who had been forced out had effectively been \u201cconstructive dismissals\u201d and urged the leadership to learn the lessons. This is about us, this is about our morality... right now, out there, people are looking at our morals and finding them wanting. I am sick of hearing warm words when I know there are many in my own local party who deserve to be thrown out of the Labour party. There are reports around this evening that Derek Hatton, who was expelled from Labour in 1986 for belonging to the leftwing Militant Tendency, has been readmitted. We understand those reports are, indeed, accurate. Hatton is the former deputy leader of Liverpool council who caused a national outcry in the 1980s by setting an illegal council budget and was denounced at the 1985 Labour conference for using taxis to send redundancy notices to thousands of council workers. He claimed to have rejoined the party last year. At that time, Labour said he was not a member. But it was understood then that the party had found no reason to deny an application from him, should one be submitted. There remains prominent dissent within Labour ranks after the party\u2019s chairman, Ian Lavery, addressed a \u201cheated\u201d meeting of collegaues this evening. Some MPs have complained Lavery failed to adequately address the issue of antisemitism and warned more MPs could consider quitting. Ian Austin, a long-standing critic of Jeremy Corbyn, said: The party has got to show it is tackling antisemitism. If that is the best the leadership can do, I can see more people taking the same course of action. I don\u2019t think he came close to demonstrating the leadership understand the scale of the problem we have. I think it will result in people thinking long and hard about their position in the party. Austin said Lavery had expressed anger that some critics of the party had described it as \u201cinstitutionally antisemitic\u201d. In an emotional intervention, the Jewish MP Ruth Smeeth was said to have complained that a party member had told her and another Jewish MP, Lousie Ellman, that they \u201cdidn\u2019t have human blood\u201d, but that no action had been taken against the individual concerned. Ellman said: It was appalling. He (Lavery) showed no understanding of the enormity of what is going on. Another Labour MP left the meeting, saying: It was a complete and utter waste of time \u2013 a dialogue of the deaf. The Telegraph goes yet further with a story published in the past few moments (premium) claiming a Conservative government minister is among those willing to join the new Independent Group if Theresa May pursues a no-deal Brexit. A Tory minister and four Conservative backbenchers appear poised to defect to the new Independent Group set up by disgruntled Labour MPs, it has been claimed. Describing the breakaway group as \u2018remarkably sensible people\u2019, the minister told the Telegraph he was prepared to join the new party if the government presses ahead with a no-deal Brexit. It came as Anna Soubry sparked speculation she is preparing to jump ship after removing a Conservative party slogan from her social media profile. While much of the focus has been on the Labour party\u2019s travails today, it hasn\u2019t exactly been an easy ride for the prime minister either. As my colleague, Jessica Elgot, reports: Four cabinet ministers have demanded the prime minister stop using the threat of no deal as a negotiating tactic, telling Theresa May that businesses and manufacturers now needed to be given certainty. The demand was made in a meeting with the prime minister on Monday by the justice secretary, David Gauke, the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, the business secretary, Greg Clark, and the Scottish secretary, David Mundell. The Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford goes even further, reporting that a host of ministers is willing to resign over the issue: It appears that Ruth Smeeth, the Labour MP who\u2019s been heavily critical of the party\u2019s response to claims of antisemitism within its ranks, will not be resigning: Concerns were expressed that other might, however: Another MP to attack the party\u2019s record on antisemitism this evening is Stella Creasy: Some more information from inside the PLP meeting room: We\u2019re beginning to get some of the content of that PLP meeting. We\u2019ll bring you more as it happens and, hopefully, a more comprehensive summary once it\u2019s over: The Labour MP, Chris Bryant, has written an article for the New Statesman explaining why he will not be making the seven into an eight. \u201cYou need a team to win a match, a crowd to move a mountain and a movement to change the political weather,\u201d he writes. Labour has a special role to play at this moment in our nation\u2019s history. We need to make a superhuman effort to be generous, warm and magnanimous, because it\u2019s only if we can widen our appeal, and strengthen our bonds to those outside our party, that we can ever hope to win votes in the Commons at this critical juncture, let alone win a general election. So I\u2019m going to continue seeing Luciana, Chris, Chuka and the rest as allies. Above all, I feel sad today. It\u2019s not just that we will miss the late Paul Flynn, possibly the most pro-European lefty in the party or in parliament, though we will. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s never good to lose old comrades. It\u2019s just that I fear chaos on the left always plays into the hands of the right \u2013 and the far-right are just waiting to mount their takeover of the Conservatives. In Westminster, what could turn out to be a lively meeting of the diminished Parliamentary Labour Party is underway: London\u2019s Ham &amp; High newspaper has an interview with Lord Bill Rodgers, a member of the \u201cgang of four\u201d who resigned from the Labour party to form the SDP in 1981, drawing inevitable comparisons with the actions of those seven MPs today. He\u2019s told the paper he\u2019s \u201cmuch impressed by the courage and strength of the new independent Labour MPs\u201d, adding that Brexit was principle among his reasons for supporting their decisions to resign from Labour. Given my long political life \u2013 I campaigned in the 1945 general election when I was sixteen \u2013 Parliament is now in chaos and Brexit would be a disaster. Breaking the stalemate is a modest but welcome step towards sanity. Away from the Labour news for a moment, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, has said no British troops or officials will be asked to put themselves in harm\u2019s way to rescue any Briton who travelled to Syria to support terrorism. But Javid has acknowledged his powers to prevent British nationals, such as Shamima Begum, from returning to the UK altogether are severely limited. Certainly, anyone that went to support terrorism in any way whatsoever, we are not going to risk the lives of any British officials \u2013 soldiers or anyone \u2013 to help them or rescue them. Javid said more than 900 people went to Syria or Iraq, adding: Whatever role they took in the so-called caliphate, they all supported a terrorist organisation and in doing so they have shown they hate our country and the values we stand for. Now, this so-called caliphate is crumbling, some of them want to return and I have been very clear where I can and where any threat remains I will not hesitate to prevent this. The powers available to me include banning non-British people from this country and stripping dangerous dual nationals of their British citizenship. Over 100 people have already been deprived in this way. But we must, of course, observe international law and we cannot do this if it would leave someone stateless \u2013 so, where individuals do manage to return they will be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted. The Tory MP for Grantham and Stamford, Nick Boles \u2013 whose relationship to his own local party is under considerably scrutiny at the moment amid anger from activists at his opposition to a no-deal Brexit - has responded to the Labour split. In his remarks he plays down the possibility of joining them - although he doesn\u2019t definitively rule it out. \u201cThey\u2019re all good people and I understand completely why they felt driven to leave Labour,\u201d he said. \u201cI have not spoken with any of them about their plans and am totally focused on working with MPs of all parties to stop a no-deal Brexit on March 29.\u201d With the meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party at 6pm, we\u2019ll keep this blog running for a while yet. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson will be taking over shortly. Thanks for all your comments. Here\u2019s a little round up of some Guardian commentary on today\u2019s split. The paper\u2019s editorial says the decision by the seven MPs to leave was a mistake, but also acts as a warning that Labour \u201cis in the midst of one of its periodic tacks, to the Corbynite left in this case, which put the broader, long-term coalition of Labour at some risk\u201d. Guardian commentators, writing here, have pretty differing views, and so do our readers. The Guardian is running an event in March, ten days before the UK is due to leave the EU, where a panel of pro-Remain politicians, including MPs Owen Smith and Chuka Umunna, discuss what\u2019s next for the 48%. You can find out more about it here \u2013 A leading Labour critic of Jeremy Corbyn, the former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale, has said a majority of the party\u2019s Scottish MPs and MSPs now backed a second EU referendum. Speaking at a People\u2019s Vote press conference in Edinburgh, Dugdale suggested there was deepening opposition among backbenchers to Corbyn\u2019s stance on Brexit, even among those who are otherwise loyal to his leadership. That extended to Labour MSPs at Holyrood, most of whom now backed a referendum on Brexit, she said. Two Scottish Labour MPs, Ian Murray in Edinburgh South and Martin Whitfield in East Lothian, already back the proposal. Many Scottish Labour figures believe Corbyn\u2019s pro-Brexit stance will cost the party seats and votes at the next general election, with the Scottish National party the most likely to benefit. Dugdale said that over the weekend Paul Sweeney, the widely-tipped Labour MP for Glasgow North East and Ged Killen, the MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, also supported a second referendum. Killen resigned from his frontbench role as a parliamentary aide last year over Corbyn\u2019s Brexit stance. That suggests Richard Leonard, Dugdale\u2019s successor as Scottish leader, faces deepening splits on Europe even though no Scottish Labour parliamentarians have so far backed the new breakaway group. Leonard implied the breakaway group could make it harder for Labour to defeat the Tories. He said in a statement: When young people are fighting for action on climate change, it is time to come together for the future, not divide. The Tory party\u2019s failed solutions represent a dead end. We must do nothing to let them off the hook. Dugdale, who resigned as Scottish leader in 2017 partly because of her deep differences with Corbyn, distanced herself from the breakaway group on Monday by insisting she still wanted to see a Labour government. But she added: I believe there\u2019s a majority of Labour MSPs in the parliament who would back a final say [on Brexit] but crucially over the weekend you saw a big development in the Scottish parliamentary Labour group with Paul Sweeney saying he would back having a final say. That means a majority of Scottish Labour MPs back it too so the momentum towards a people\u2019s vote is growing in the Labour party and as a consequence I think the likelihood of a people\u2019s vote across the country is also increasing. I have never been more optimistic about a people\u2019s vote taking place than I am today. Angela Smith has apologised for comments she made during a TV debate about racism. Appearing on the BBC\u2019s Politics Live programme today, Smith appeared to talk about people being a \u201cfunny tinge\u201d. \u201cThe recent history of the party I\u2019ve just left suggested it\u2019s not just about being black or a funny tin ... you know, a different... from the BAME community,\u201d she said. In a video statement, Smith said: \u201cI\u2019ve seen the clip from Politics Live. I\u2019m very sorry about any offence caused and I\u2019m very upset that I misspoke so badly. It\u2019s not what I am. I am committed to fighting racism wherever I find it in our society.\u201d Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has issued a statement on Facebook, saying that the party must change if it wants to avoid more resignations. He said that there was no time to waste if Labour wanted to stop more people from leaving and that the party needed to be \u201ckinder and gentler\u201d. \u201cI love this party but sometimes I no longer recognise it,\u201d he said. Watson said he did not regard the seven MPs who resigned as traitors, but thought they had drawn the wrong conclusion to a serious question. \u201cThis is a moment for regret and reflection, not for a mood of anger or a tone of triumph,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are those who are already celebrating the departure of colleagues with whom they disagree. The tragedy of the hard left is they they can be too easily tempted into the language of heresy and treachery. Betrayal narratives and shouting insults at the departed might make some feel better briefly, but it does nothing to address the reasons why good colleagues might want to leave.\u201d Speaking about Luciana Berger\u2019s decision to quit the party, citing the leadership\u2019s failure to do enough to tackle anti-semitism, he said: \u201cI\u2019d like to place on record my complete respect for Luciana and my understanding of the decision to which she has been driven. \u201cThey say antisemitism is a light sleeper and this is certainly a wake-up call for the Labour party. We were slow to acknowledge that we had a problem and even slower to deal with it. Even a single incident of antisemitism in the Labour party shames us and shames us all. Now we\u2019ve lost Luciana, one of our most dedicated and courageous MPs. If someone like her no longer believes there is a role for her in the Labour party then many other colleagues will be asking themselves how they can stay.\u201d Some of you who tuned in for this morning\u2019s press conference \u2013 in which seven Labour MPs announced they would quit the party \u2013 might have heard a surprising commentary. \u201cBetween this and Brexit we are actually fucked,\u201d an unknown male voice could be heard saying as the event was broadcast live across the BBC Two and BBC News channels. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be so divided \u2026 The Conservatives are going to win.\u201d A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cDue to an error, we inadvertently broadcast some background comments from another microphone during our coverage of the press conference this morning. We apologised on air once we realised our mistake.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: This is interesting from Guardian media editor Jim Waterson \u2013 The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has responded to this morning\u2019s resignations by echoing calls for the seven MPs to stand down and fight byelections. \u201cWe should be working together for the long-term interests of the country, so I\u2019m disappointed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut all of these MPs stood on our manifesto in 2017 \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s manifesto. They all increased their majorities. Now they\u2019re on a different platform so the honourable thing, the usual thing for them to do now, is for them to stand down and fight by-elections back in their constituencies.\u201d Here\u2019s some non-Labour news from the Guardian\u2019s Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll. Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, has insisted the country would not be \u201csteamrolled\u201d into giving ground on the border backstop. After meeting the British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, on the fringes of the EU foreign ministers\u2019 meeting in Brussels, the t\u00e1naiste again rejected any suggestion that the mechanism to ensure a free-flowing border could be altered. He said the blame for the impasse lay not with Ireland, but with the UK parliament, and the solution lay with the British government. \u201cThe responsibility to resolve this problem in terms of the way forward needs to lie where the problem is, which is in London not Dublin. We would be very foolish if we allowed the onus to solve that problem to switch away from Westminster to Dublin,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been consistent, we have been fair, we have negotiated as part of an EU team with the British government in good faith and we will continue to do that but we will not be steamrolled in this process.\u201d He also said Brussels was open to the Labour party\u2019s proposal for permanent membership of the customs union as a means of resolving the border issue. George Galloway has written to the Labour party to ask to be readmitted as a member in light of the resignation of seven MPs this morning. In the video, entitled \u201cGalloway on the Dance of the Seven Veils #SevenDwarfs\u201d, he said \u201cthere\u2019s a whole raft of rats about to jump ship\u201d. He accused the seven MPs of \u201crolling out the poisonous lie\u201d that the Labour leadership is antisemitic, something he described as the \u201cgreatest, grossest defamations in all political history\u201d. He said the group had ties to Labour Friends of Israel and were more concerned with criticism of the Israeli government than antisemitism. Galloway said he hoped his membership would be supported by people who \u201crecognise that I have a big voice and a big reach in British society and indeed further afield and that unlike the seven dwarves who ditched the Labour party today, I believe in Labour\u201d. I loved the Labour party much more than those who kicked me out of it ever loved it. Indeed, they are the people who almost killed it. Jeremy Corbyn has brought it back to life. So watch this space, there will be others leaving, but \u2013 like me \u2013 I hope there will be others joining. Angela Smith, one of the seven MPs to resign from the Labour party today, has been criticised after appearing to talk about people having a \u201cfunny tinge\u201d in a debate about racism. Appearing on the BBC\u2019s Politics Live programme, Smith said: \u201cThe recent history of the party I\u2019ve just left suggested it\u2019s not just about being black or a funny tin ... you know, a different ... from the BAME community\u201d. Christine Jardine, one of the four Scottish Liberal Democrat MPs who won or regained seats in the 2017 snap election, has refused to rule out a future merger between the Lib Dems and the new breakaway group of former Labour MPs. There has been growing speculation a new centrist party could soon be formed by the breakaway group coalescing around Chuka Umunna, the Lib Dems and pro-European Tories, funded by powerful donors such as Lord Sainsbury. Anti-Corbyn figures in Scottish Labour see it as a likely outcome, with the Lib Dems failing to capitalise electorally on the factional conflicts inside the Labour and Tory parties. Asked at a People\u2019s Vote event in Edinburgh whether she felt there was a case for that merger, Jardine said: It\u2019s very early days. I recognise it must have been an incredibly difficult decision for everybody who has been in any political party for decades to walk away, and that has to be recognised. And going forward, if we share common ideals and people find a way to work with them, then what that will be it\u2019s far too early to say but we do welcome working with anyone who shares our ideals and our principles, whether they\u2019re in a new party or the Labour party. So I think at the moment we just have to wait and see where this is going. Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, has been speaking to BBC News. He said the seven breakaway MPs should call byelections. \u201cIf they regard themselves as democrats, I wonder if they are going to stand down and create byelections,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of them talked about how proud they are to represent their constituents. Well, if they\u2019re so proud of that why don\u2019t they give their constituents the opportunity to see if they want them elected.\u201d He said the split had clearly been being planned for a while. \u201cIt is what it is. It\u2019s a group of individuals who have decided to go a different path from the platform that they stood on just 18 months ago. There\u2019s a strong whiff of hypocrisy here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey stood as Labour MPs on a platform in the general election 18 months ago. All of them got massive increases in their majorities. I have to tell them it wasn\u2019t because of their own personal charisma. It was because of a manifesto which promised to respect the 2016 referendum and take us out of Europe, so all of their heartbreak sounds a little bit hollow.\u201d In a statement, Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 union, said: I regret that seven MPs have decided they no longer wish to represent their constituencies in parliament as Labour MPs, especially as that was how they were elected. On a Labour ticket at a general election that inspired millions to vote Labour and saw the party increase its vote by the largest share since 1945. Their decision to walk out into the political wilderness \u2013 remember the fate of the SDP? \u2013 is sad, but not unexpected. The Labour party\u2019s membership has grown enormously under Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party\u2019s genuinely socialist manifesto was incredibly popular at the last election. Reaction from Dave Prentis, the general secretary of Unison, the UK\u2019s biggest trade union, struck a very different tone: Today\u2019s launch of \u201cthe Independent Group\u201d \u2013 a group of seven former Labour MPs who will now sit as a separate entity in parliament \u2013 has run up against some technical difficulties. The group\u2019s website doesn\u2019t seem to have been working since this morning and now people are pointing out that Chuka Umunna\u2019s website is down too. Seven Labour MPs have resigned from the party over Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, saying they will sit as a new independent group in parliament. The MPs \u2013 Chuka Umunna, Luciana Berger, Gavin Shuker, Angela Smith, Chris Leslie, Mike Gapes and Ann Coffey \u2013 accused the party of being \u201cinstitutionally racist\u201d and betraying its members over Brexit. Here is a summary of what we know about \u201cthe Independent Group\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn has said he is \u201cdisappointed that these MPs have felt unable to continue to work together for the Labour policies that inspired millions at the last election and saw us increase our vote by the largest share since 1945\u201d. Many Labour MPs \u2013 from across the various wings of the party \u2013 have expressed dismay at the split. Ed Miliband said: \u201cLabour\u2019s values are still my values and a Labour government is the best hope for the country\u201d. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has demanded to know if the seven MPs will field candidates in Labour/Tory marginals. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, retweeted a call for the seven MPs to stand down and call byelections as independents. The final report of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee\u2019s 18-month fake news investigation has accused Facebook of purposefully obstructing its inquiry and failing to tackle attempts by Russia to manipulate elections. The reports denounces Facebook and its executives as \u201cdigital gangsters\u201d. It says the company deliberately broke privacy and competition law and should urgently be subject to statutory regulation. The seven MPs have started to put their resignation statements on social media. Here is the Conservative party\u2019s response, via chairman Brandon Lewis, to this morning\u2019s events: The resignations and speeches today confirm in former Labour MPs\u2019 own words, that the Labour party has changed irreversibly under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Labour has become the Jeremy Corbyn party \u2013 failing to take action on everything from tackling anti-Jewish racism to keeping our country safe. We must never let him do to our country what he is doing to the Labour party today. Here\u2019s a roundup of some Labour reaction to the split announcement. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has written on Facebook that it is a \u201cdesperately sad day\u201d for Labour and that he will stick with the party. \u201cThese seven MPs are all friends of mine. I served alongside them in parliament,\u201d he wrote. I agree that the only way through the mess of Brexit is to give the public the final say, and that the Labour party needs to do much more to root out the evil of anti-semitism. However, history clearly shows that the only way to get real change in our society \u2013 whether fighting for a public vote, tackling inequality, or ending austerity \u2013 is within the Labour party. When the Labour party splits it only leads to one outcome \u2013 a Tory government \u2013 and that means a hard Tory Brexit. The shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, tweeted: The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, posted on Facebook: If you criticise or abuse these individuals, if you impugn their motives, and if you encourage any others to join them, you are helping them not hurting them, because you are taking your eyes off the prize and allowing our movement to be distracted and divided, which is exactly what they want. The only thing that anyone should do in response to the action of these MPs today is to respectfully and politely ask them a simple question: Do they intend to put up candidates in Labour-Tory marginals, and split the Labour vote? Laura Parker, the national co-ordinator of Momentum, said: Labour\u2019s common-sense socialism has widespread support amongst the public, has inspired hundreds of thousands to join the party and caused the most spectacular electoral comeback in British history. Labour now has a plan to rebuild Britain. These MPs want to take us back to the politics of the past. With a back-to-the-Blair-years programme of privatisation, tax cuts for the rich and deregulation of the banks, they offer no concrete solutions, no new ideas and have no support amongst the public. And Ed Milliband tweeted: Ian Murray, the Scottish Labour MP closest to the breakaway group, has warned Jeremy Corbyn he faces a deeper split and further Labour backbench resignations unless he shifts ground on Europe and anti-semitism. In a statement issued on Monday, Murray, the staunchly anti-Brexit MP for Edinburgh South seen by many as a potential recruit to the new independent party, said: The current Labour leadership is breaking the broad church that this party once built its electoral success upon \u2013 a broad church which delivered Labour governments that lifted millions and millions of people out of poverty. The challenge now is for Jeremy Corbyn to listen and learn, and decide if he wants to keep the Labour Party together or if he will continue to foster a culture of bullying and intolerance where his own MPs feel unwelcome and are being forced out. Murray has refused to rule out joining the breakaway group but said at the weekend he wanted Labour to remain a broad church, and wanted to see a Labour government. That\u2019s it from the press conference. Seven MPs have left the Labour party and announced they will form a new independent group in parliament. They said they were disgusted by the party\u2019s handling of anti-semitism and its Brexit policy. People have speculated that this might happen ever since Corbyn\u2019s 2015 leadership win and now it finally has. The MPs are \u2013 Chuka Umunna, MP for Streatham and former shadow business secretary. Luciana Berger, MP for Liverpool Wavertree and former shadow minister for mental health. Gavin Shuker, MP for Luton South and former shadow international development minister. Angela Smith, MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge and former shadow deputy leader of the House of Commons. Chris Leslie, MP Nottingham East and former shadow chancellor. Mike Gapes, MP for Ilford South and former chair of the foreign affairs select committee. Ann Coffey, MP for Stockport and former parliamentary private secretary to Alistair Darling when he was chancellor of the exchequer. The group is not yet a political party, although they said at the press conference earlier that they could develop into one over time. They will have their first formal meeting in the next few days to assign roles and responsibilities. The group\u2019s website seems to be having teething troubles, so I can\u2019t link to the group\u2019s statement, but here are some key passages. Labour now pursues policies that would weaken our national security; accepts the narratives of states hostile to our country; has failed to take a lead in addressing the challenge of Brexit and to provide a strong and coherent alternative to the Conservatives\u2019 approach; is passive in circumstances of international humanitarian distress; is hostile to businesses large and small; and threatens to destabilise the British economy in pursuit of ideological objectives. For a party that once committed to pursue a spirit of solidarity, tolerance and respect, it has changed beyond recognition. Today, visceral hatreds of other people, views and opinions are common-place in and around the Labour Party. It is not simply that our values are no longer welcome in the Labour Party; the values we hold mean that, in all conscience, we can have no confidence in the party\u2019s collective leadership, competence or culture. Values \u2013 Britain works best as a diverse, mixed social market economy, in which well-regulated private enterprise can reward aspiration and drive economic progress and where government has the responsibility to ensure the sound stewardship of taxpayers\u2019 money and a stable, fair and balanced economy; A strong economy means we can invest in our public services. We believe the collective provision of public services and the NHS can be delivered through government action, improving health and educational life chances, protecting the public, safeguarding the vulnerable, ensuring dignity at every stage of life and placing individuals at the heart of decision-making. ... The barriers of poverty, prejudice and discrimination facing individuals should be removed and advancement occur on the basis of merit, with inequalities reduced through the extension of opportunity, giving individuals the skills and means to open new doors and fulfil their ambitions. Individuals are capable of taking responsibility if opportunities are offered to them, everybody can and should make a contribution to society and that contribution should be recognised. Paid work should be secure and pay should be fair. ... In order to face the challenges and opportunities presented by globalisation, migration and technological advances, we believe the multilateral, international rules-based order must be strengthened and reformed. We believe in maintaining strong alliances with our closest European and international allies on trade, regulation, defence, security and counter-terrorism. As part of the global community we have a responsibility to future generations to protect our environment, safeguard the planet, plan development sustainably and to act on the urgency of climate change. Power should be devolved to the most appropriate level, trusting and involving local communities. More powers and representation should be given to local government to act in the best interests of their communities. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable, who himself left Labour for the SDP in 1982, has tweeted about the split. Various Labour MPs \u2013 from all wings of the party \u2013 are responding in dismay to today\u2019s announcement. The youth wing of the UK Labour Party has tweeted a line from The Red Flag in reaction. Luciana Berger is being asked about the antisemitism issue. She says they saw the unprecedented sight of a minority community taking to parliament square to protest against racism in her majesty\u2019s opposition. She talks about the battle to get the party to adopt the IHRA definition of antisemitism. Angela Smith says it is incumbent on everyone to acknowledge the problem with antisemitism in the Labour party. She says it is one of the major reasons for their departure. Umunna says they whole-heartedly support the People\u2019s Vote campaign. He says it\u2019s \u201cbeen like getting blood from a stone getting the Labour party to do the right thing by our constituents on this issue\u201d. Good summary from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand here \u2013 Chris Leslie says, to people who say \u201cnothing ever changes\u201d, \u201cif you don\u2019t try, you\u2019ll never know\u201d. Umunna adds: \u201cYou can\u2019t change the status quo if you rejoin it ... We are saying there needs to be a new offer and a new alternative.\u201d He says they will not be joining the Liberal Democrats. The new \u201cIndependent Group\u201d has launched its twitter account and a website. The group\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t seem to be available yet. Jeremy Corbyn has reacted to the news that seven Labour MPs have decided to leave the party and form a new group in parliament. Here is the full statement: I am disappointed that these MPs have felt unable to continue to work together for the Labour policies that inspired millions at the last election and saw us increase our vote by the largest share since 1945. Labour won people over on a programme for the many not the few \u2013 redistributing wealth and power, taking vital resources into public ownership, investing in every region and nation, and tackling climate change. The Conservative Government is bungling Brexit, while Labour has set out a unifying and credible alternative plan. When millions are facing the misery of Universal Credit, rising crime, homelessness and poverty, now more than ever is the time to bring people together to build a better future for us all. Now, the MPs are open for questions. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg asks the MPs about the suggestion that them leaving will make a Tory win at the next election more likely. Mike Gapes says: \u201cThis is not the Labour party that I fought against Trotskyists in student politics. This is a Labour party that has changed beyond recognition.\u201d He says it\u2019s about moral integrity and that he has come to his own breaking point. Angela Smith says that lots of people feel politically homeless at the moment and that they cannot be complicit in this broken politics. Chuka Umunna, the MP for Streatham, says the current parties are part of the problem, not the solution. \u201cIt is time we dumped this country\u2019s old-fashioned politics,\u201d he says. The UK needs a political party \u201cfit for the here and now\u201d and the \u201cfirst step in leaving the tribal politics behind\u201d. \u201cYou don\u2019t join a political party to fight the people within it,\u201d he says. The new group will have its first formal meeting in the coming days. Umunna says the bottom line is: \u201cPolitics is broken. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Let\u2019s change it.\u201d Ann Coffey, the MP for Stockport, says the Labour party is no longer a broad church. \u201cThe current leadership has been very successful at changing the party beyond recognition,\u201d she says. \u201cLoyalty cannot be an end in itself.\u201d She says the new independent group will work to change a political system in which they feel they have no voice. Coffey remains committed to her constituents: \u201cOur values haven\u2019t changed. My values haven\u2019t changed.\u201d Mike Gapes, MP for Ilford South, says he is sickened by antisemitism in the party and is furious that the Labour leadership is facilitating Brexit. \u201cJeremy Corbyn and those around him are on the wrong side in so many international issues, from Russia, to Syria to Venezuela,\u201d he says. Gavin Shuker, the MP for Luton South, says the new independent group \u201cdoes not think every problem in the world has been created by the west\u201d. \u201cWe back well-regulated business but in return we expect them to provide decent, secure and well-paid jobs,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are values that once would have been considered mainstream in our parties of government,.\u201d Shuker says political parties in the UK are broken and that there is complete absence of leadership at the moment the country needs it most. \u201cThe Labour party has turned its back on the British public, their hopes and ambitions,\u201d he concludes. Now Angela Smith, MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, says she is from a Labour-supporting, working-class family who were ambitious for her. \u201cMost people are like my family. They do not want to be patronised by leftwing intellectuals who think that being poor and working-class is a state of grace.\u201d She says her decision to resign her membership has been very painful. Leslie says it would be irresponsible to allow Jeremy Corbyn to be prime minister, which is something other Labour MPs will say privately. He accuses the leadership of having a \u201cnarrow and outdated ideology\u201d. \u201cTo them, the world divides between oppressor and oppressed, class enemies, when in truth the modern world is more complicated than this.\u201d Chris Leslie, MP for Nottingham East, is speaking now. He says it has not been an easy decision and that they have all been MPs for very many years. The Labour party they joined, campaigned for and believed in has been hijacked by the \u201cmachine politics of the hard left\u201d, he says. Luciana Berger says she cannot remain in a party that is \u201cinstitutionally antisemitic\u201d. She says the leadership has failed to address hatred against Jewish people within its ranks and that she is leaving behind \u201ca culture of bullying, bigotry and intimidation\u201d. They will publish a full statement setting out their position shortly. Seven MPs have entered the room. Luciana Berger, MP for Liverpool Wavertree, is speaking. She says they have all resigned from the Labour party this morning and will now sit in parliament as an independent group of MPs. She says she has become embarrassed and ashamed to be in the Labour party. The event in Westminster, where a group of Labour MPs could say they are leaving the party, should begin any minute now. You can watch the live stream of the announcement at the top of this blog. Today\u2019s Guardian front page, which has been overshadowed by news of a possible Labour split, reveals that the final report of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee\u2019s 18-month fake news investigation has accused Facebook of purposefully obstructing its inquiry and failing to tackle attempts by Russia to manipulate elections. The reports denounces Facebook and its executives as \u201cdigital gangsters\u201d. It says the company deliberately broke privacy and competition law and should urgently be subject to statutory regulation. \u201cDemocracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised \u2018dark adverts\u2019 from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day,\u201d warned the committee\u2019s chairman, Damian Collins. You can read the story here \u2013 If a group of Labour MPs do indeed leave the party at this morning\u2019s press conference, it will be the biggest breakaway since four senior Labour figures quit on 26 March 1981 to form the Social Democratic party. The group, nicknamed \u201cthe gang of four\u201d, were MPs David Owen and Bill Rodgers, Roy Jenkins (who left Parliament in 1977 to serve as president of the European commission) and Shirley Williams (who had lost her seat in the 1979 general election). In what became known as the Limehouse Declaration \u2013 because it was made from Owen\u2019s house in Limehouse \u2013 the group announced they were leaving the party due to its decision to commit to unilateral nuclear disarmament and withdrawal from the European Economic Community. Andy Beckett\u2019s piece from 2016 provides some nice historical context for today\u2019s event. Journalists are gathering excitedly at County Hall in Westminster for the \u201cannouncement by a group of Labour MPs relating to the future of British politics\u201d, and are searching for clues for what is to come later this morning. The event is due to start at 10am. A number of Labour MPs have tweeting their continued commitment to the party. ITV News\u2019s political editor Robert Peston has posted on his Facebook page about the expected announcement that a group of Labour MPs will leave the party. He says the mystery is not why they are going \u2013 their anger at the leadership\u2019s handling of Brexit and antisemitism is well documented \u2013 but why now. The mystery is why today, rather than in a fortnight or six weeks, when perhaps the UK\u2019s EU destiny will be a bit clearer. The point is that those running the People\u2019s Vote campaign for a referendum have been desperately trying to persuade Ummuna and Leslie to delay their split - because they think if they were to leave the party now, that would entrench the reluctance of Corbyn and those close to him to back a referendum. As and when Umunna and co formally leave Labour, the call for a referendum will be closely associated with those who have set themselves up as the enemies of Corbyn and his socialist project. So the referendum-sceptics around Corbyn will tell him that conceding a People\u2019s Vote would be to capitulate to those who want to destroy him. So the big question for Umunna and the Labour refuseniks today is whether in leaving Labour because they want a referendum they are not in practice undermining the prospect of a referendum. Tributes are pouring in to Paul Flynn, the Labour MP for Newport West, who died yesterday. Flynn, 84, represented his constituency since 1987. He had announced his intention to stand down as an MP in October due to ill health. His local Labour association announced his death on Twitter on Sunday night: \u201cIt\u2019s with great sadness that we let you know that our MP, Paul Flynn, has died today. \u201cPaul is a hero to many of us in the Newport Labour family and we mourn for his family\u2019s loss. We would ask that the privacy of Paul\u2019s family is respected at this difficult time.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn tweeted: The Guardian\u2019s Whitehall Correspondent has tweeted pages from Flynn\u2019s book How to Be an MP: Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s politics live blog. A small group of Labour MPs are expected to announce they will quit the party this morning due to anger over how the party is dealing with Brexit and allegations of antisemitism. About five MPs are likely to announce their departure, including Chuka Umunna, Chris Leslie, Luciana Berger and Angela Smith. Rowena Mason, the Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor, says: \u201cDespite the small number, it would be the biggest split in the party since four senior Labour figures quit in the 1980s to form the Social Democratic party.\u201d Labour MP Stephen Kinnock told BBC Radio 4\u2019s The Westminster Hour on Sunday: \u201cThe talk has been going on so long that I say with great regret that yes, there probably will be some kind of splintering. It just seems to have been in the rumour mill so long that it\u2019s unlikely that wouldn\u2019t be the outcome.\u201d Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said on Sunday that he did not see \u201cany need for anybody to split from the party\u201d, but said Labour would look at a proposal put forward by backbenchers Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson to back a second Brexit referendum in the next round of Brexit votes on 27 February. An event due to be held at 10am in Westminster has been described as: \u201cAnnouncement by a group of Labour MPs relating to the future of British politics.\u201d I\u2019ll bring you the latest on this story throughout the day.",

      "bodyText": "Four cabinet ministers have demanded the prime minister stop using the threat of a no-deal Brexit as a negotiating tactic, telling Theresa May that businesses and manufacturers now needed to be given certainty. The demand was made in a meeting with the prime minister on Monday by the justice secretary, David Gauke, the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, the business secretary, Greg Clark, and the Scottish secretary, David Mundell. Cabinet sources suggested it would be a key intervention before May\u2019s expected visit to Brussels on Wednesday and described all four as loyalists who were keen to deliver a Brexit deal. The ministers who requested the meeting with May believe that while no deal had once been a sensible negotiating tactic, a number of alarming announcements by businesses and manufacturers over recent weeks meant it was time for the option to be categorically ruled out. Downing Street described it as a \u201cprivate meeting\u201d and gave no further details, but the discussions are likely to inform the weekly cabinet meeting on Tuesday. The intervention is likely to set the ministers firmly at odds with rebel Eurosceptics, determined to keep no deal as a viable option. May was defeated in parliament last week at the hands of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, who abstained on a government motion because it appeared to rule out a no-deal Brexit. The prime minister is expected to meet the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, on Wednesday, departing for Brussels after prime minister\u2019s questions. Speaking earlier on Monday, May\u2019s de facto deputy, David Lidington, said a no-deal Brexit would cause \u201cserious damage to our economy and, I think, put strain on the union of the United Kingdom\u201d. The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, is expected to set out in a speech this week what changes would be required to eliminate the legal risk of being indefinitely trapped in the Irish backstop, the key sticking point for many of the pro-Brexit rebels. Downing Street hopes that any changes that Brussels can offer will be enough to materially change Cox\u2019s previous legal advice \u2013 which they believe would be enough to win over significant numbers of Tory MPs. Cox and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, held talks with the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on Monday over Theresa May\u2019s request for the withdrawal agreement to be reopened. Cox laid out to Barnier what assurances would be needed for him to be able tell MPs the backstop would be temporary. It is understood that text offering MPs assurances will be on the table this week, although sources stressed discussions were at an early stage. Lawyers from the UK and the European commission, who sat in on the meeting on Monday, are expected to work together in the coming days on precise legal text but neither side has suggested the withdrawal agreement itself would be reopened. Barclay and Cox are expected to return to Brussels on Wednesday to discuss a \u201clegal way forward\u201d. Barclay said: \u201cThe attorney general shared his thinking in terms of the legal way forward and how we address the central issue of concern signalled in the Brady amendment in terms of having an outcome that addresses this issue between the article 50 legal underpinning that\u2019s temporary and his advice to parliament in terms of the indefinite nature of the backstop. \u201cWe agreed a next step forward so we\u2019ll be engaging again midweek, the attorney general and I, and we\u2019ll firm up the precise logistics of that in the morning.\u201d The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said the outcome of the Brexit talks was \u201cin God\u2019s hands\u201d. In an interview with a German newspaper, he said: \u201cWhen it comes to Brexit, it is like being before the courts or on the high seas; we are in God\u2019s hands. And we can never quite be sure when God will take the matter in hand.\u201d Juncker said the EU was not \u201copposed\u201d to an extension of article 50, but suggested it could not be longer than a few months. \u201cIf you are asking for how long the withdrawal can be postponed, I have no timeframe in mind,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Brexit so many timetables have already gone by the wayside. \u201cBut I find it hard to imagine that British voters would again vote in the European elections. That to my mind would be an irony of history. Yet I cannot rule it out.\u201d",

World Facebook deliberately broke privacy and competition law and should urgently be subject to statutory regulation, according to a devastating UK parliamentary report denouncing the company and its executives as \u201cdigital gangsters\u201d. The final report of select committee\u2019s 18-month investigation into disinformation and fake news has accused Facebook of purposefully obstructing its inquiry and failing to tackle attempts by Russia to manipulate elections. Donald Trump has again attacked Andrew McCabe, this time in response to an interview in which the former deputy FBI director discussed his new book and made claims damaging to the president. Poland\u2019s prime minister has accused Israel\u2019s foreign minister of racism in an escalating diplomatic row over the Holocaust that resulted in the cancellation on Monday of an international summit in Jerusalem. A Chinese surveillance company has been tracking the movements of at least 2.5 million residents in a province where Muslim minorities have been the target of a far-reaching security clampdown, internet experts have found. DNA found on a napkin has led to a Minnesota businessman being charged in a 25-year-old murder case. Investigators ran crime scene DNA evidence through a genealogy website then obtained the suspect\u2019s DNA from a napkin thrown away at a hockey rink. Opinion and analysis In the role of television host, it\u2019s necessary to skate smoothly along the surface, so it\u2019s notable that Osher G\u00fcnsberg, one of Australia\u2019s most enduring and successful TV hosts, has so openly chronicled his struggles with and triumphs over mental illness. The Bachelor host tells Brigid Delaney that while making himself vulnerable has been liberating, it can come with pressure, too. \u201cJust getting out of the house can be a gigantic task for some people,\u201d he says. \u201cIt might be all you can do to look someone in the eye.\u201d It\u2019s often claimed that counting one hour\u2019s work a week in the employment statistics skews the data, so that unemployment is hidden. But, as Greg Jericho explains, not counting as employed those 14,500 Australians would produce a distorted picture of the current state of the labour force, which is a complex sector of the economy. The reality is the unemployment rate and employment data do not tell the whole story \u2013 and they have never been meant to. Sport It is just one case, brought by just one athlete, against a single organisation. But Caster Semenya\u2019s challenge to the IAAF\u2019s testosterone rules for female athletes, which began this week at the court of arbitration for sport, may yet be as far-reaching and profound as the Bosman ruling. The 2019 Super W season kicks off this weekend amid great anticipation. Rugby Australia has reported a 20% increase in female participation in the XVs form of the code. What will Super W offer a sport-loving public that is increasingly enthralled with women\u2019s sport? Thinking time: It\u2019s all about the Benjamins, baby Ilhan Omar made history in January when she became the first Somali American and one of the first Muslim women sworn into the US Congress. Part of a historically diverse crop of candidates elected in the 2018 midterms, the hijab-wearing Minnesotan is one of the faces of change in Donald Trump\u2019s America, a country she entered as a 12-year-old refugee. But in less than two months, she has also found herself at the centre of controversy, reckoning with the scrutiny that accompanies the national spotlight. This week, Omar was forced to apologise for comments that Democratic leaders said contained \u201cantisemitic tropes and prejudicial accusations\u201d.

Former Bestjet staff say the online travel portal deliberately stalled refunds until customers \u201chounded\u201d consultants, leaving customers out of pocket for six months or more, the ABC reports. The Australian is leading with \u201cHouseholds\u2019 $2bn solar hit\u201d, a story on claims that every home will have to pay $200 in rooftop solar installation subsidies this year, \u201cthreatening to derail Scott Morrison\u2019s pledge to cut power bills\u201d.

I believe the public in every country would expect us to continue to cooperate on these matters as much as possible.\u201d</p> <p>There will also be issues with the exchange of DNA data, laws on extradition and the European Arrest Warrant, Javid reminds his counterparts.</p> <p>In a no-deal scenario, the UK will no longer participate in these systems or in Europol and will be treated like a third country with no operational agreements, although exchanges will be possible on an ad hoc basis, according to an EU Task Force 50 <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/consolidated-slides_preparedness_seminar_20_december_2018_final.pdf\">no-deal analysis</a> produced in December.</p> <p>The letter comes just days after<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/11/no-deal-brexit-would-make-britain-less-safe-says-police-chief\"> a police chief warned</a> that a no-deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> would damage police powers to detain foreign suspects and leave British fugitives in Europe beyond the law.</p> <p>Javid warns there is \u201cno non-EU fallback mechanism\u201d for the exchange of airline passenger information.</p> <p>The current passenger information exchange system, set up following a wave of Isis attacks, allows British airlines to add passenger names and other data to passenger information units (PIUs) in every EU state and EU airlines to transfer data to the UK\u2019s PIU.</p> <p>The home secretary tells his counterparts that the UK is \u201clooking to engage directly with the [European] commission to safeguard our mutual interest\u201d on this matter.</p> <p>In a no-deal scenario, crime, security and justice-related data that would normally be shared through the Schengen Information System (SIS II) would now go through Interpol, Javid writes, asking each member state to be on standby to do the same if necessary.</p> <p>Steve Peers, professor of EU law and human rights law at the University of Essex, said: \u201cThe home secretary\u2019s letter admits what many law enforcement practitioners had warned: leaving the EU without an agreement leads to \u2018less efficient\u2019 and more costly methods of cooperation between justice and law enforcement officials.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Sajid Javid, has urged his EU counterparts to prepare for the eventuality that current joint policing systems could discontinue on 30 March because of a no-deal Brexit. The EU and the UK have produced similar contingency plans for no-deal arrangements but Javid has now written to member states appealing for them to \u201cminimise operational disruption\u201d by ensuring measures are in place on time. He also warns that there is, as yet, no deal in place for sharing of airline passenger data, critical in the fight against criminals and terrorists who flee to another country to escape the law. \u201cI wanted to write to you now to ensure readiness for the alternative contingency arrangements should that become necessary,\u201d writes Javid. \u201cWe must do all we can to minimise operational disruption in this vital area.\u201d He adds: \u201cNothing matters more than keeping our citizens safe. I believe the public in every country would expect us to continue to cooperate on these matters as much as possible.\u201d There will also be issues with the exchange of DNA data, laws on extradition and the European Arrest Warrant, Javid reminds his counterparts. In a no-deal scenario, the UK will no longer participate in these systems or in Europol and will be treated like a third country with no operational agreements, although exchanges will be possible on an ad hoc basis, according to an EU Task Force 50 no-deal analysis produced in December. The letter comes just days after a police chief warned that a no-deal Brexit would damage police powers to detain foreign suspects and leave British fugitives in Europe beyond the law. Javid warns there is \u201cno non-EU fallback mechanism\u201d for the exchange of airline passenger information. The current passenger information exchange system, set up following a wave of Isis attacks, allows British airlines to add passenger names and other data to passenger information units (PIUs) in every EU state and EU airlines to transfer data to the UK\u2019s PIU. The home secretary tells his counterparts that the UK is \u201clooking to engage directly with the [European] commission to safeguard our mutual interest\u201d on this matter. In a no-deal scenario, crime, security and justice-related data that would normally be shared through the Schengen Information System (SIS II) would now go through Interpol, Javid writes, asking each member state to be on standby to do the same if necessary. Steve Peers, professor of EU law and human rights law at the University of Essex, said: \u201cThe home secretary\u2019s letter admits what many law enforcement practitioners had warned: leaving the EU without an agreement leads to \u2018less efficient\u2019 and more costly methods of cooperation between justice and law enforcement officials.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Nearly 400 employees at Flybmi have lost their jobs following the collapse of the regional British airline at the weekend. Flybmi formally appointed the restructuring firm BDO as administrators on Monday after ceasing to trade on Saturday. BDO announced that 376 employees in the UK, Germany, Sweden and Belgium have been made redundant, although some will assist with the administration. The airline\u2019s immediate owner, British Midland Regional, operated 17 regional jet aircraft on routes to 25 European cities but cancelled hundreds of flights at short notice over the weekend, leaving passengers stranded. Thousands of passengers have been left out of pocket after the collapse of the airline, which operated more than 600 flights a week from regional airports including Bristol, Newcastle, Aberdeen and east Midlands. Tony Nygate, BDO business restructuring partner and joint administrator, said: \u201cAs joint administrators, we are taking all necessary steps to ensure customers, staff and suppliers are supported through the administration process. Our job is to maximise recoveries and minimise distress for all parties, acting as smoothly and swiftly as possible. \u201cCustomers can find information on the flybmi website regarding the steps they need to take to apply for a refund from their payment provider or travel company. We are also working with the company\u2019s employees to provide them with guidance on how to make a claim for monies which may be due to them. In addition, we are contacting suppliers to explain how to apply for monies owed to them.\u201d Administrators will now evaluate Flybmi\u2019s assets, including its former headquarters at Castle Donington, to work out how much it can return to creditors, including suppliers of fuel and food. It is thought to be highly unlikely that people who bought tickets for cancelled flights, who rank as unsecured creditors, will recover any money. Some passengers are able to rebook via partner airlines Lufthansa, Brussels Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Loganair, Air France and Air Dolomiti, which have \u201cshared ticket\u201d flights with Flybmi. Ryanair and easyJet are also offering cheap rescue flights on some routes. The group\u2019s ultimate parent company, Airline Investments, which is owned by brothers Stephen and Peter Bond, is continuing to trade, as is its sister firm, Loganair, which has said it will step in and take over five of Flybmi\u2019s routes from next month.

Coveney, who held meetings with both the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and Hunt in Brussels on Monday, called for Downing Street to bring \u201csome sense\u201d to the negotiations. He reiterated the EU line that the bloc would not renegotiate the backstop, which could keep the UK in a customs union to avoid a border on the island of Ireland. Coveney added that Ireland would neither accept a time limit or its replacement with an alternative arrangement, such as a technological solution, which he said would leave peace in Northern Ireland relying on \u201cwishful thinking\u201d. \u201cI think the asks of the British parliament and the British government have to be reasonable ones,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is essentially remove or change the guarantee and the insurance ... that prevents border infrastructure in the future and replace it with something that is wishful thinking rather than something that is tested. \u201cWe can\u2019t either support a time limit to the backstop because \u2013 unless you can answer the question what happens after that set period of time \u2013 we are just kicking the issue further down the road without answers. \u201cA backstop with a set time limit isn\u2019t a backstop at all. We all want it to be temporary but it has to be replaced by something that is credible and tested.\u201d The comments came as the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, also held talks with Barnier over the UK\u2019s demands for a reopening of the withdrawal agreement. Following the meeting, Barclay said he would meet Barnier again on Wednesday over a \u201clegal way forward\u201d. The two negotiating teams are seeking a solution that will allow Cox, to change his advice that the Irish backstop is \u201cindefinite\u201d to being temporary. He said: \u201cThe attorney general shared his thinking in terms of the legal way forward and how we address the central issue of concern signalled in the Brady amendment in terms of having an outcome that addresses \u2026 the indefinite nature of the backstop. We agreed a next step forward so we\u2019ll be engaging again midweek.\u201d The British prime minister has insisted that she needs a time-limit to the backstop, a unilateral exit mechanism or its replacement with alternative arrangements to get her deal through the Commons. Coveney said a no-deal Brexit would be a \u201ccrazy\u201d outcome but that there was \u201cno appetite\u201d for renegotiating the withdrawal agreement. \u201cWe want to find ways of providing the reassurance and clarification the British prime minister needs to be able to sell that deal in Westminster,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t involve reopening that withdrawal agreement and reopening that negotiation.\u201d A UK source said: \u201cThis is categorically not about isolating Ireland. We have a shared interest in getting a deal that reassures people\u2019s concerns over the Irish border and meets our commitments to the Belfast agreement. \u201cThese can only be made legally watertight if a deal is ratified by parliament and made law. There is a clear route to doing this, and we need to work together to make it happen.\u201d There are signs that Dublin is feeling pressure from Brussels to start planning for checks on goods going between Ireland and Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has insisted that he is not making any preparations for a hard border but privately he has been warned that Ireland will have to protect the EU\u2019s border with the UK. The commission issued fresh warnings on Monday to businesses over their need to adapt to new customs and indirect taxation systems such as VAT. Pierre Moscovici, the commissioner for economic and financial affairs, taxation and customs, said: \u201cWith the risk of a no-deal Brexit increasing as we get closer to 29 March, the European commission and national customs authorities are working hard to be ready to introduce checks and controls on goods flowing between the EU and the UK. This is key to protecting our consumers and our internal market.\u201d",

It may be out of print as we got the last copy in Ambleside Tourist Information two years ago, but a gentle nudge from the Guardian might encourage another print run. Cairngorms National Park has a free leaflet called Paths with Easy Access, Discover Badenoch and Strathspey, with interesting routes in it.

The Mexican president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, signed a declaration at his Monday morning press conference closing the federal prison on the Islas Mar\u00edas, 60 miles off Mexico\u2019s Pacific coast, saying he wanted to promote \u201cmore schools and fewer prisons\u201d. He said of the prison island: \u201cIt\u2019s a history of punishments, of torture, of repression over more than a century.\u201d Of the 600 prisoners on the island 200 will be released, while the rest will be relocated to prisons on the Mexican mainland. The former prison will turned into a cultural centre and rechristened Walls of Water: Jos\u00e9 Revueltas, after a book the communist writer wrote that was inspired by two periods of imprisonment on the island for political activism, which helped to make him one of its most famous former inmates. Inmates serving long sentences lived on the islands \u2013 known as the Mexican Alcatraz \u2013 with their families. The Islas Mar\u00edas appeared to be outliving its usefulness in the early 2000s and its population was reduced from approximately 8,000 inmates after a 2003 riot. The facility found a new purpose in recent years as the country\u2019s crackdown on drug cartels and organised crime flooded the prison system with inmates. Despite its difficult past, professionals working in Mexico\u2019s prison system expressed dismay with the president\u2019s decision, saying it spoke of past problems and it didn\u2019t portend country-wide change. The Islas Mar\u00edas is also considered one of Mexico\u2019s best-run and most humane correctional facilities, according to the National Human Rights Commission, in a country where jails are often rife with corruption, control by inmates and human rights abuses. \u201c[It\u2019s] closing the penitentiary that has the only efficient model of social reinsertion,\u201d said Paola Zavala Saeb, a former director of the Mexico City government\u2019s Social Reinsertion Institute. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s decision to close the Islas Mar\u00edas and his surprise visit to the islands followed a weekend tour of the western states of Sinaloa and Durango, long considered the heartland of Mexico\u2019s illegal drugs business. He toured the Sierra Madre mountains and held a rally on Friday in Badiraguato \u2013 home town of the convicted drug cartel kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n \u2013 where he announced plans to pull the area out of poverty by finishing construction of a highway through the sierra, opening a university and providing 20,000 permanent jobs planting pine trees.",

The Honda announcement \u2013 with its knock-on consequences for its UK supply chain \u2013 will make the employers organisations even more insistent that a no-deal outcome should be ruled out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/18/carmaker-honda-plans-to-close-swindon-factory-reports\">'Shattering body blow' as Honda plans to close Swindon factory</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brexit was not the only factor involved. Honda production in Swindon never fully recovered from the deep global recession of 2008-09. Before the financial crisis, the plant produced 230,000 cars a year, but that is now down to 161,000. Of the three models once made in Swindon, two \u2013 the Jazz and the CR-V \u2013 have been moved elsewhere, leaving just the Civic.</p> <p>Global factors have not helped either. There has been a sharp decline in demand for diesel vehicles. Japanese companies have a tendency to pull production back home when the world economy looks shaky. What\u2019s more, Donald Trump\u2019s threat of import tariffs on European-made cars may make the export of Swindon\u2019s Civics to the US more expensive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/04/brexit-what-are-carmaker-contingency-plans\">Brexit: what are carmakers' contingency plans?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Honda\u2019s original investment in Swindon in 1985 was motivated by a desire to have a plant inside the EU and so avoid paying the tariff \u2013 currently 10% \u2013 on imported vehicles. But that tariff will be phased out as a result of a new free trade deal between the EU and Japan which came into force at the start of this month.</p> <p>Justin Tomlinson, who as Conservative MP for North Swindon represents many of the Honda workforce, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinTomlinson/status/1097507582820995072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1097507582820995072&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbusiness%2F2019%2Ffeb%2F18%2Fcarmaker-honda-plans-to-close-swindon-factory-reports\">said he had been told by the company</a> and the business secretary, Greg Clark, that the decision was down to global market trends and not related to Brexit.</p> <p>This, though, is overegging things. The hit to global demand was far more severe in 2008-09 than it is at present. Trump may simply be sabre-rattling. The 10% tariff on cars imported into the EU will not be fully phased out until 2027, five years after the Swindon plant is due to close. In 2022 it will still be more than 6%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>So while Honda\u2019s decision is not simply about Brexit, uncertainty caused by Brexit played its part.

      "bodyText": "We told you so. That will be the reaction of Britain\u2019s leading business groups to the news that Honda is to close its Swindon plant with the loss of about 3,500 jobs in 2022. For at least a year, bodies such as the CBI, the EEF and the British Chambers of Commerce have been telling ministers that the uncertainty caused by Brexit would have serious consequences. The Honda announcement \u2013 with its knock-on consequences for its UK supply chain \u2013 will make the employers organisations even more insistent that a no-deal outcome should be ruled out. Brexit was not the only factor involved. Honda production in Swindon never fully recovered from the deep global recession of 2008-09. Before the financial crisis, the plant produced 230,000 cars a year, but that is now down to 161,000. Of the three models once made in Swindon, two \u2013 the Jazz and the CR-V \u2013 have been moved elsewhere, leaving just the Civic. Global factors have not helped either. There has been a sharp decline in demand for diesel vehicles. Japanese companies have a tendency to pull production back home when the world economy looks shaky. What\u2019s more, Donald Trump\u2019s threat of import tariffs on European-made cars may make the export of Swindon\u2019s Civics to the US more expensive. Honda\u2019s original investment in Swindon in 1985 was motivated by a desire to have a plant inside the EU and so avoid paying the tariff \u2013 currently 10% \u2013 on imported vehicles. But that tariff will be phased out as a result of a new free trade deal between the EU and Japan which came into force at the start of this month. Justin Tomlinson, who as Conservative MP for North Swindon represents many of the Honda workforce, said he had been told by the company and the business secretary, Greg Clark, that the decision was down to global market trends and not related to Brexit. This, though, is overegging things. The hit to global demand was far more severe in 2008-09 than it is at present. Trump may simply be sabre-rattling. The 10% tariff on cars imported into the EU will not be fully phased out until 2027, five years after the Swindon plant is due to close. In 2022 it will still be more than 6%. So while Honda\u2019s decision is not simply about Brexit, uncertainty caused by Brexit played its part. Japanese policy makers \u2013 from the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, down \u2013 have been pressing for a soft Brexit ever since the referendum, initially privately but recently more openly. Politically, therefore, the Honda decision will add to the already considerable pressure on Theresa May. \u201cThe threat of Brexit is already having a damaging impact on investment decisions in the UK,\u201d said Rachel Reeves, the Labour chair of the Commons business committee. \u201cThe PM now needs to rule out no deal immediately and keep us in the single market and customs union rather than risk further fatal damage to our car industry.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In many respects the Labour MP Paul Flynn, who has died aged 84 after nearly 32 years in the House of Commons, was the quintessential backbencher of his generation. He was an admirably energetic constituency MP, a tireless campaigner on a vast range of issues and fearless in the face of authority. It was thus a measure of his success that he was as much an irritant to his own party in government as he was to the Conservative frontbench, and that this was indubitably countered by the personal affection he generated among his Newport electorate.</p> <p>Born in Grangetown, Cardiff, and raised with his brother, Michael, by their widowed mother, Kathleen (nee Williams), he experienced the heady days of the post second world war Attlee government. As a 10-year-old lad, he cheered the election of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/28/guardianobituaries.politics\" title=\"\">James Callaghan</a> as the local Labour MP in 1945 and recalled hearing <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Aneurin-Bevan\" title=\"\">Aneurin Bevan</a> speak in the city in 1948, as the minister of health, establishing the new NHS.</p> <p>It was a topic of close family interest. His Irish father, James Flynn, had gone to the trenches of Belgium as a teenager in the first world war and had been shot and subsequently captured as a prisoner of war. He survived and returned home to work as a postman, but the family finances were defined by means-testing and doctors\u2019 bills before his early death in 1940.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d730b834569e089b1d35bc191aa4d53bcd096c8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d730b834569e089b1d35bc191aa4d53bcd096c8b/0_1_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Flynn speaking at a legalise cannabis tea party outside parliament in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Flynn speaking at a legalise cannabis tea party outside parliament in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary Turner/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paul was raised as a Roman Catholic by his Welsh mother, and won a place at <a href=\"http://www.stilltyds.org.uk/history/\" title=\"\">St Illtyd\u2019s college</a>, Cardiff, which was then a Roman Catholic boys\u2019 grammar school. He qualified as an industrial chemist at University College, Cardiff, and in 1955 began work in the steel industry, first in the docks area of Cardiff, where he suffered serious hearing loss working in a nail factory, and subsequently at Llanwern, in Newport.</p> <p>In 1983 he was made redundant, and after a brief period in broadcasting started work the following year as a researcher for the MEP Llewellyn Smith. His election to Westminster as MP for Newport West came in 1987. He had joined the Labour party in 1956 and was elected as a member of Newport borough council (1972-81) and of Gwent county council (1974-82). He fought the second general election in 1974 in the safe Conservative seat of Denbigh.</p> <p>In the Commons Flynn\u2019s brief experience of the frontbench came at the very beginning and end of his career. Neil Kinnock made him a junior spokesman for Wales shortly after his arrival in the house, aged 52. In 1988 he was moved to social security for two years, but then began his long sojourn on the backbenches, where he rejoiced in being described by the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/06/simon-hoggart-obituary\" title=\"\">Simon Hoggart</a> as \u201cthe thinking man\u2019s Dennis Skinner\u201d, a soubriquet he felt was suitable for his epitaph.</p> <p>Few could have been more surprised than he when, aged 81 in 2016, he was appointed by Jeremy Corbyn as shadow leader of the house and then also shadow Welsh secretary. They were temporary posts after a wave of frontbench resignations had hit the Corbyn leadership, and while Flynn spoke approvingly of his leader\u2019s job creation for older people he found himself retired once more after three months to a less prominent parliamentary role.</p> <p>It was never one of obscurity. Flynn had strong opinions on most things and a vivid vocabulary with which to articulate his views. He had the eloquence of his Welsh and Irish forebears, which he could exhibit in both his native English and the fluent Welsh he learned in his teenage years. He could also do an unintelligible, but apparently accurate, rendition of Chaucerian English. A passionate advocacy of the use of the Welsh language was one of his lifelong concerns and he was a member of the Gorsedd of the Bards.</p> <p>Other topics with which he was very much involved included the medicinal use of cannabis, for which he started campaigning in 1999, and the dangers of overdosing from the use of paracetamol.

Before election to parliament he was a member of the Broadcasting Council for Wales (1975-80), the South Wales Docks Board (197680) and the National Museum of Wales (1978-82).</p> <p>Flynn suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, which was first diagnosed when he was nine years old. Although he recovered from a mini-stroke in 2007, his health had recently deteriorated with the onset of pernicious anaemia and he announced in October that while he wanted to go on being an MP \u201cfor ever\u201d, he would stand down as soon as possible. He was a highly competent user of all forms of digital technology, having won awards for <a href=\"http://www.paulflynnmp.co.uk/\" title=\"\">his MP\u2019s website</a>, and continued to work from his bed. </p> <p>He published a number of books about politics, including a guide to being a backbencher (1997), updated as How to Be an MP (2012).

Still, the champion trainer seemed to be keeping his sense of humour as he hosted his annual pre-Festival media morning and evidently still expects to do very well at the race meeting where his 60 career wins is a British record, with Buveur D\u2019Air and Altior heading a long list of classy contenders.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have got thrown out of sync here,\u201d said Henderson, reflecting on the rule requiring a recent vaccination, introduced in the middle of one night last week. It was \u201ca nuisance\u201d, he added, requiring him to stop exercising most of his string for three or four days, with Cheltenham a month away.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/feb/18/talking-horses-skelton-has-fingers-crossed-as-vaccinated-horses-return\">Talking Horses: Dan Skelton crosses fingers as vaccinated runners return</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Eton-educated Henderson is by no means an anti-authority figure but last week\u2019s disruption provokes him at least to hint at criticisms of the British Horseracing Authority. \u201cIf they had given warning of it, even the day it came out, that that was a possibility, we could have done something about it,\u201d he said of the new vaccination rule.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat I can\u2019t understand is, they can find four horses in Simon Crisford\u2019s yard that are positive [for equine influenza] on Sunday and negative on Wednesday. Something\u2019s gone badly wrong there. Something\u2019s going badly wrong everywhere but there we go.\u201d</p> \n<p>The BHA got another couple of digs in the ribs, for loudly telling Cheltenham to water before the Festival, even though the racecourse has had such a policy for years, and for not reorganising enough races for horses prevented from running last week. Another little obstacle for Henderson is neither he nor anyone else will be able to gallop Cheltenham-bound horses after racing at Kempton on Saturday, which has long been his practice, because this time there are anti-flu biosecurity measures in place and horses are not wanted on the site if they are not taking part in a race. The trainer still hopes to be able to work some horses there next Tuesday but that remains the subject of negotiation.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe annoying thing was that the week before [the flu crisis] we\u2019d had only four days\u2019 racing after a freeze-up. This place seemed to be the epicentre of the Arctic Circle. There was no snow in Gloucestershire or over at Ascot. We had a foot and a half. We had to stay in the covered ride for a week. So it\u2019s not been easy.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/17/haydock-park-deplores-crowd-trouble-mother-child-surrounded-horse-racing\">Haydock deplores crowd fights in which mother holding child surrounded</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Still, Henderson is upbeat about his chances and had a ready answer for those who doubt the worth of Buveur D\u2019Air\u2019s Champion Hurdle win a year ago, when he scrambled home by a neck from Melon with the outsider Mick Jazz close up in third. The suggestion is that the champ had caught some of what was ailing the horse in the next box, We Have A Dream, who was found to have a temperature the day before the Champion Hurdle and was hastily moved to a barn.</p> \n<p>\u201cBuveur D\u2019Air\u2019s as tough as teak and he didn\u2019t get over Cheltenham at all last year. I\u2019d have come back to Aintree with him, which he did the year before, should have been a piece of cake for him. And he wasn\u2019t impressive in the Champion Hurdle and it took him apart. Races don\u2019t affect him, you could run him again the next week. But he hadn\u2019t recovered in four weeks to go anywhere near Aintree and nor had Rather Be, who was in the next door box. So I think you can take it there was something.\u201d</p> \n<p>Altior continues to please in his preparation for another Champion Chase, while Henderson is seeing signs of hope from Might Bite, who has had such a disappointing season but will try his luck in the Gold Cup. The horse has had his soft palate recauterised in the hope it will help his breathing. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a few other things, freshened him up, changed a few things. Nico De Boinville rode him on Saturday and thought he was in terrific form, really great.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8968d105-307e-4903-9fe7-2dd45257e790\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Wetherby</b> <b>1.55 </b>Baileys Artist <b>2.25 </b>Kalahari Queen <b>2.55</b> Coolanly <b>3.30</b> Generous Day (nb) <b>4.00</b> Magic Dragon <b>4.35</b> Strong Resemblance <b>5.05</b> Zoutoise</p>\n    <p><b>Taunton</b><b> 2.10</b> Iniesta <b>2.40</b> Scaramanga <b>3.10</b>&nbsp;Midnightreferendum <b>3.45</b> Quiz Master <b>4.15</b> Encore Champs <b>4.50</b> Danboru <b>5.20</b> Princess Midnight</p>\n    <p><b>Wolverhampton</b><b> 5.30</b> Rainbow Lad <b>6.00</b> Aguerooo <b>6.30</b> Upavon <b>7.00</b> Amor Fati <b>7.30</b> Beauty Salon <b>8.00</b> Dawn Crusade (nap)<b> <br> 8.30 </b>Jouvert</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

It was \u201ca nuisance\u201d, he added, requiring him to stop exercising most of his string for three or four days, with Cheltenham a month away. The Eton-educated Henderson is by no means an anti-authority figure but last week\u2019s disruption provokes him at least to hint at criticisms of the British Horseracing Authority. \u201cIf they had given warning of it, even the day it came out, that that was a possibility, we could have done something about it,\u201d he said of the new vaccination rule. \u201cWhat I can\u2019t understand is, they can find four horses in Simon Crisford\u2019s yard that are positive [for equine influenza] on Sunday and negative on Wednesday. Something\u2019s gone badly wrong there. Something\u2019s going badly wrong everywhere but there we go.\u201d The BHA got another couple of digs in the ribs, for loudly telling Cheltenham to water before the Festival, even though the racecourse has had such a policy for years, and for not reorganising enough races for horses prevented from running last week. Another little obstacle for Henderson is neither he nor anyone else will be able to gallop Cheltenham-bound horses after racing at Kempton on Saturday, which has long been his practice, because this time there are anti-flu biosecurity measures in place and horses are not wanted on the site if they are not taking part in a race. The trainer still hopes to be able to work some horses there next Tuesday but that remains the subject of negotiation. \u201cThe annoying thing was that the week before [the flu crisis] we\u2019d had only four days\u2019 racing after a freeze-up. This place seemed to be the epicentre of the Arctic Circle. There was no snow in Gloucestershire or over at Ascot. We had a foot and a half. We had to stay in the covered ride for a week. So it\u2019s not been easy.\u201d Still, Henderson is upbeat about his chances and had a ready answer for those who doubt the worth of Buveur D\u2019Air\u2019s Champion Hurdle win a year ago, when he scrambled home by a neck from Melon with the outsider Mick Jazz close up in third. The suggestion is that the champ had caught some of what was ailing the horse in the next box, We Have A Dream, who was found to have a temperature the day before the Champion Hurdle and was hastily moved to a barn. \u201cBuveur D\u2019Air\u2019s as tough as teak and he didn\u2019t get over Cheltenham at all last year. I\u2019d have come back to Aintree with him, which he did the year before, should have been a piece of cake for him. And he wasn\u2019t impressive in the Champion Hurdle and it took him apart. Races don\u2019t affect him, you could run him again the next week. But he hadn\u2019t recovered in four weeks to go anywhere near Aintree and nor had Rather Be, who was in the next door box. So I think you can take it there was something.\u201d Altior continues to please in his preparation for another Champion Chase, while Henderson is seeing signs of hope from Might Bite, who has had such a disappointing season but will try his luck in the Gold Cup. The horse has had his soft palate recauterised in the hope it will help his breathing. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a few other things, freshened him up, changed a few things. Nico De Boinville rode him on Saturday and thought he was in terrific form, really great.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump returned to the attack against Andrew McCabe on Monday, in response to an interview in which the former deputy FBI director discussed his new book and made claims damaging to the president. In the interview, broadcast by CBS 60 Minutes on Sunday night, McCabe addressed, among other matters: How the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein was told by Trump to write a memo justifying the firing of FBI director James Comey in May 2017. How, following the firing of Comey, McCabe ordered investigations of whether it was done to impede the investigation of Russian election interference and whether Trump was acting on behalf of the Russian government. How he believes that is why he himself was fired. Discussions about whether Trump could be removed from office under the 25th amendment. Discussions about whether Rosenstein should wear a wire to record the president. How Trump ignored US intelligence advice on North Korea\u2019s nuclear capability and said: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I believe Putin.\u201d Trump attacked McCabe on Twitter on Thursday, when CBS released excerpts of the interview, and again on Sunday night, when it was broadcast in full. Before dawn on the Presidents\u2019 Day holiday, he returned to the offensive. \u201cWow,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cSo many lies by now disgraced acting FBI director Andrew McCabe. He was fired for lying, and now his story gets even more deranged. He and Rod Rosenstein, who was hired by [former attorney general] Jeff Sessions (another beauty), look like they were planning a very illegal act, and got caught. \u201cThere is a lot of explaining to do to the millions of people who had just elected a president who they really like and who has done a great job for them with the military, vets, economy and so much more. This was the illegal and treasonous \u2018insurance policy\u2019 in full action!\u201d Trump\u2019s reference to an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d was to a text message sent by Peter Strzok, an FBI agent, to a bureau lawyer, Lisa Page, about the Russia investigation and Trump\u2019s chances of winning the White House. On CBS, McCabe said Rosenstein brought up the possibility of removing Trump using the 25th amendment, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to deem a president unfit to perform his duties. \u201cIt was an unbelievably stressful time,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t even describe for you how many things must have been coursing through the deputy attorney general\u2019s mind at that point. So it was really something that he kinda threw out in a very frenzied chaotic conversation.\u201d The deputy attorney general also offered to wear a wire to record conversations with Trump, McCabe said. \u201cHe said, \u2018I never get searched when I go into the White House. I could easily wear a recording device. They wouldn\u2019t know it was there.\u2019 Now, he was not joking. He was absolutely serious.\u201d On Thursday, the Department of Justice said in a statement Rosenstein rejected McCabe\u2019s version of events as \u201cinaccurate and factually incorrect\u201d. \u201cThe deputy attorney general [DAG] never authorized any recording that Mr McCabe references,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAs the DAG previously has stated, based on his personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th amendment, nor was the DAG in a position to consider invoking the 25th amendment.\u201d McCabe was fired by Sessions in March 2018, just short of retirement and after repeated attacks by Trump, including on his wife, a former Democratic candidate in Virginia. He was found to have \u201cmade an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor\u201d during an internal review of an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. McCabe denies that charge, over which he may yet be prosecuted. He told CBS he followed Department of Justice protocol in providing information to the Wall Street Journal, and said he believes he \u201cwas fired because I opened a case against the president of the United States\u201d. In his book, he offers an unflattering portrayal of Sessions, who resigned after the midterm elections. The Guardian obtained a pre-publication copy of McCabe\u2019s book, The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump. He writes that Rosenstein complained Trump forced him to write a now notorious memo justifying the firing of Comey. He told CBS: \u201cRod was concerned by his interactions with the president, who seemed to be very focused on firing the director and saying things like, \u2018Make sure you put Russia in your memo.\u2019 That concerned Rod in the same way that it concerned me and the FBI investigators on the Russia case. \u201cIf Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein listed the Russia investigation in his memo to the White House, it could look like he was obstructing the Russia probe by suggesting Comey\u2019s firing. And by implication, it would give the president cover.\u201d Rosenstein, McCabe said, \u201cexplained to the president that he did not need Russia in his memo. And the president responded, \u2018I understand that, I am asking you to put Russia in the memo anyway.\u2019\u201d Publicly, shortly after Comey\u2019s firing, Trump told NBC he had done it because of \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d. He also invited a group of Russian diplomats into the Oval Office and told them: \u201cI just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That\u2019s taken off.\u201d McCabe told CBS: \u201cThe president had gone to Jim Comey and specifically asked him to discontinue the investigation of [the former national security adviser] Mike Flynn, which was a part of our Russia case. The president, then, fired the director. \u201cIn the firing of the director, the president specifically asked Rod Rosenstein to write the memo justifying the firing and told Rod to include Russia in the memo. Rod, of course, did not do that. That was on the president\u2019s mind. \u201cThen, the president made those public comments that you\u2019ve referenced both on NBC and to the Russians, which was captured in the Oval Office. Put together, these circumstances were articulable facts that indicated that a crime may have been committed. \u201cThe president may have been engaged in obstruction of justice in the firing of Jim Comey.\u201d The special counsel Robert Mueller, appointed after the Comey firing, is believed to be close to issuing his final report on Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Moscow and possible obstruction of justice by the president. He has charged and convicted Trump aides, including Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former lawyer Michael Cohen. Trump denies collusion with Russia and has repeatedly called the investigation a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d. On Sunday he alleged \u201creal collusion\u201d among TV networks producing critical or mocking coverage of him, specifically in Alec Baldwin\u2019s impersonation of him on Saturday Night Live. In Congress, the political battle is intensifying. Democrats in the House are promising to investigate the president. Republicans in the Senate are vowing to fight back. On Tuesday morning, for the third day in a row, Trump travelled to his golf club in Florida. On CBS, McCabe was asked how he could remember conversations with Trump well enough to put them in a book. Like any good FBI agent, he said, he had written memos at the time. Asked where those documents were now, he said: \u201cThose memos are in the custody of the special counsel\u2019s team.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 18 February 2019. An earlier version erroneously said that Rod Rosenstein had denied discussing the 25th amendment or suggested wearing a wire. In addition the article has been amended to correctly reflect the justice department\u2019s response to McCabe\u2019s allegations.",

So there\u2019s no rigging of the figures by the government to count more people as employed than in the past. The data is what the data was.</p> <p>But you can understand why people think there is a problem. At the end of last year the unemployment rate fell to 5.0%, while in the same month the underemployment rate rose to 8.4%.

      "bodyText": "One of the common complaints about the employment statistics is that employment is counted as being just one hour of paid work in a week. It is often used to discredit the figures and to suggest the current unemployment rate is hiding unemployment more than in the past. To counter these criticisms, the Bureau of Statistics last week released a short paper on the issue that shows few people actually work such a small number of hours and that excluding them would not give us an improved picture of the economy. The definition of at least one hour of paid work constituting employment is neither new nor unusual. It is the international standard adopted in 1982 by the International Labour Organisation, and it reflected standard practice. So there\u2019s no rigging of the figures by the government to count more people as employed than in the past. The data is what the data was. But you can understand why people think there is a problem. At the end of last year the unemployment rate fell to 5.0%, while in the same month the underemployment rate rose to 8.4%. This marked the biggest gap between the two measures. And after all, one hour of work is certainly not enough to pay for anything, and surely counting these people is skewing the data to make things look better than they are? Certainly, if we didn\u2019t count the number of people working one hour as employed, that would increase the unemployment rate. But it would also produce a distorted picture. The ABS estimates that in December there were 14,500 people working one hour a week \u2013 just 0.1% of all employed. It is a minuscule number. But the ABS also estimates that there were 85,900 people working 2-3 hours, 250,900 working 4-6 hours and 244,600 working 7-9 hours. Now, if we decided that working fewer than 10 hours a week meant you were not really employed then the unemployment rate would of course be higher than it is now \u2013 it would take the rate from 5.0% to 9.5%: Now that might be more satisfying to those who think work should be a decent level of hours. But why stop at 10? Why not exclude all part-time employees? But then the problem of course is that a full-time job is also no guarantee that you can pay the bills. The count of people working is not supposed to measure the poverty rate, or even if people\u2019s living standards are improving. It merely measures how many people are working in any one month. That it does not measure income, inflation, living standards, or any of the many others things that are important, does not mean it is irrelevant. Now sure, one problem with those who work few hours is that they overwhelmingly wish to work more \u2013 the level of underemployment among those who work less than 10 hours a week is nearly four times that of all other workers: But crucially, more than two thirds of such workers do not wish to work more hours. Should we not count those people as employed even though they are happy with how much they work? It would be worth worrying about the current definition of employment if that cohort of low hour workers was the reason behind the recent spike in underemployment and the growing gap between unemployment and underemployment that has happened since the middle of 2014. But it is not. In fact it is the opposite. Since the middle of 2014 the percentage of employed who work fewer than 10 hours a week has steadily fallen to now be at the lowest level this century: The issue has not been the growth of low hour workers, but a shrinking of those working above 40 hours: Since the middle of 2014 the percentage of employees working fewer than 20 hours a week and more than 40 hours a week has shrunk, while the percentage working 20-39 hours has increased. The issue is not about those working a small number of hours becoming a bigger segment of the labour force, but the shift from full-time to part-time. And think on this: were we to count those working under 10 hours a week as unemployed, the unemployment rate would be higher, but compared with the middle of 2014, when underemployment and unemployment split, the picture would be much improved over the current definition. Counting 1-9 hours-a-week workers as unemployed sees a bigger drop in unemployment since the middle of 2014 than does the current definition. I\u2019m not sure those who think we should be sceptical of the level of employment would like a switch to a definition that would suggest the labour market has improved more in the past three and half years than is currently the case. The reality is the unemployment rate and employment growth do not tell the whole story \u2013 and they have never been meant to. Look at hours worked, underemployment and \u2013 coming this Wednesday \u2013 wages growth. The economy is complex. Anyone who tries to tell you the unemployment rate is all you need to know is a fool, and not counting those who work a small number of hours a week would not change this \u2013 but it would make the picture much more distorted. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "The Royal Australasian College of Physicians has raised problems with the new independent health advice panel established by the medical evacuations bill, including the lack of remuneration for medical experts appointed to the new body. The college told its members over the weekend it had raised a number of issues about the health panel with the immigration minister since the medevac bill passed last week, including the \u201cextremely short timeframe\u201d for nominating members and the \u201clack of funding and other support for members who are appointed to the IHAP\u201d. The communication from the college to members says: \u201cA person is not entitled to remuneration in respect of their position as a member of the panel. \u201cNo reimbursement for any associated activities will be provided. The college is seeking clarification from the minister on this point.\u201d The medical evacuations bill, which has been the catalyst for the the resumption of brutal partisan warfare on border protection in Canberra, codifies procedures for the transfer of people in Nauru and Manus Island to Australia if they need medical attention, and gives clinicians more say than under current arrangements. The new system establishes an independent panel made up of the commonwealth chief medical officer, the home affairs department\u2019s chief medical officer, and at least six others \u2013 a nominee of the president of the Australian Medical Association, of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists and of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, and an expert in paediatric health. The independent panel will be required to review decisions within 72 hours if the minister refuses to allow a transfer on health grounds. If the panel says it should proceed, the minister can refuse if the transfer is considered prejudicial to security, or if the person has a substantial criminal record. Despite an escalation in political contention about Australia\u2019s borders being \u201cweakened\u201d because of the legislation, the new procedures only apply to people currently on Nauru and Manus Island, not to any new boat arrivals. After a high-stakes wrangle in the parliament last week, where the government flagged a potential constitutional problem with the bill, the legislation was amended to specify that people on the new panel will not be paid for their contributions. That amendment was inserted to avoid a potential breach of section 53 of the constitution. It is unclear whether the government will move to address the concerns flagged by the college, because it opposes the bill that passed the House last week and says the new procedures will be repealed in the event it secures a majority at the election in May. A spokeswoman for the immigration minister, David Coleman, declined to comment when approached for a response. According to the internal communication seen by Guardian Australia, the college of physicians has called for nominations for the panel, noting the government has asked for at least 10 nominees to be forwarded for consideration for appointment to the new oversight panel by this Wednesday. A spokesman for the college says there have been around 20 nominations from physicians over the past couple of days. The college said it was proceeding with the call for nominations despite having \u201ca number of concerns with the process, which may ultimately mean that we are not able to comply with some or all aspects of the minister\u2019s request\u201d. \u201cNevertheless we are issuing this expressions of interest request to ensure we are ready to meet the minister\u2019s request in the event our concerns are addressed.\u201d A spokesman for the college told Guardian Australia the organisation was \u201cmoving quickly to try and facilitate the panel\u201d but was still \u201cwaiting to hear back from the government on some questions around the selection and panel operation\u201d. The correspondence from the college to members notes \u201cour strong evidence-based opposition to immigration detention\u201d. It reminds members the body signed on to the kids off Nauru campaign, \u201curging the Australian parliament to support the immediate transfer of all refugee and asylum seeker children and their families from Nauru to Australia for health reasons\u201d. It says that campaign has \u201cbeen instrumental in raising awareness of the severe and detrimental impact that living in indefinite offshore detention has on the health and wellbeing of these children\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>The Swiss actor Bruno Ganz, who has died aged 77 from cancer, was a wise and contemplative presence, as familiar, consoling and crumpled as a favourite overcoat.</p> <p>He came to prominence in three films by the director <a href=\"http://www.wim-wenders.com/\" title=\"\">Wim Wenders</a>. In The American Friend (1977), adapted from <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-patricia-highsmith-1571740.html\" title=\"\">Patricia Highsmith</a>\u2019s novel Ripley\u2019s Game, he was a shy picture-framer who is persuaded, under the misapprehension that he is dying, to become an assassin in order to provide for his family.</p> <p>In Wenders\u2019 philosophical love story Wings of Desire (1987), set in pre-unification Berlin, he played an angel who decides to become mortal after falling for a female trapeze artist. Ganz\u2019s performance was touching and characteristically understated; he returned to the role in the inferior sequel Faraway, So Close! (1993). Meanwhile, Nicolas Cage donned Ganz\u2019s wings for City of Angels (1998), the inevitable Hollywood remake of the Wenders original.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f2ef0c5db9556feb372ba7828276b111ce272ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f2ef0c5db9556feb372ba7828276b111ce272ba/0_102_2800_1680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bruno Ganz, left, and Dennis Hopper in The American Friend, 1977.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bruno Ganz, left, and Dennis Hopper in The American Friend, 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given Ganz\u2019s gentleness, it is ironic that millions of viewers came to know his work only from a snippet showing him at his most enraged. In Downfall (2004), he gave a rounded and highly considered portrayal of Adolf Hitler during the final days of the dictator\u2019s life.</p> <p>A clip of Ganz in the part, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7PmzdINGZk\" title=\"\">ranting and raving in his bunker</a>, became an internet sensation, with the subtitles adjusted repeatedly to make it appear that he was fulminating on some crisis of the day \u2013 the relegation of Newcastle United, say, or the shortcomings of the latest games console or mobile phone.</p> <p>While acknowledging the creativity of this trend, and its part in widening his appeal (\u201cThey\u2019ve made me more popular than I could ever have imagined\u201d), Ganz expressed reservations: \u201cYou have to understand I put everything into that performance so it\u2019s not easy for me to accept it.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, he went to great pains in Downfall to show Hitler as a tormented and nuanced individual racked with insecurities and quivering with tremors from Parkinson\u2019s. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/sep/14/guardianobituaries.germany\" title=\"\">Joachim Fest</a>, the German historian whose book Inside Hitler\u2019s Bunker was one of the film\u2019s source materials, said of Ganz\u2019s performance: \u201cThat really is Hitler.\u201d</p> <p>Ganz was born in Zurich, the son of a Swiss mechanic and his northern Italian wife. As a teenager he attended drama school and later worked as a bookseller, as well as training to be a paramedic. He left Switzerland in the early 1960s to become a stage performer in G\u00f6ttingen and Bremen, playing Hamlet in 1965, a role he was to reprise 17 years later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e92609bd956d948167e486c6c35b920f90fb004b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e92609bd956d948167e486c6c35b920f90fb004b/0_169_2254_1352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bruno Ganz in Wings of Desire, 1987.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bruno Ganz in Wings of Desire, 1987.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/Allstar/Road Movies</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1970 he co-founded with Peter Stein the alternative theatre company <a href=\"https://www.schaubuehne.de/de/start/index.html\" title=\"\">Schaub\u00fchne</a>. \u201cClearly we were actors and theatre people, but we understood ourselves as being part of 1968,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was definitely leftwing theatre.\u201d</p> <p>Some of their productions were adapted for television, such as Brecht\u2019s Die Mutter and Ibsen\u2019s Peer Gynt (both 1971), but it was Ganz\u2019s performance in the 1976 television version of Max Gorky\u2019s Summerfolk that launched his wider film and TV career.</p> <p>In the same year he starred in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/11/eric-rohmer-obituary\" title=\"\">Eric Rohmer</a>\u2019s 18th-century drama The Marquise of O.

      "bodyText": "The Swiss actor Bruno Ganz, who has died aged 77 from cancer, was a wise and contemplative presence, as familiar, consoling and crumpled as a favourite overcoat. He came to prominence in three films by the director Wim Wenders. In The American Friend (1977), adapted from Patricia Highsmith\u2019s novel Ripley\u2019s Game, he was a shy picture-framer who is persuaded, under the misapprehension that he is dying, to become an assassin in order to provide for his family. In Wenders\u2019 philosophical love story Wings of Desire (1987), set in pre-unification Berlin, he played an angel who decides to become mortal after falling for a female trapeze artist. Ganz\u2019s performance was touching and characteristically understated; he returned to the role in the inferior sequel Faraway, So Close! (1993). Meanwhile, Nicolas Cage donned Ganz\u2019s wings for City of Angels (1998), the inevitable Hollywood remake of the Wenders original. Given Ganz\u2019s gentleness, it is ironic that millions of viewers came to know his work only from a snippet showing him at his most enraged. In Downfall (2004), he gave a rounded and highly considered portrayal of Adolf Hitler during the final days of the dictator\u2019s life. A clip of Ganz in the part, ranting and raving in his bunker, became an internet sensation, with the subtitles adjusted repeatedly to make it appear that he was fulminating on some crisis of the day \u2013 the relegation of Newcastle United, say, or the shortcomings of the latest games console or mobile phone. While acknowledging the creativity of this trend, and its part in widening his appeal (\u201cThey\u2019ve made me more popular than I could ever have imagined\u201d), Ganz expressed reservations: \u201cYou have to understand I put everything into that performance so it\u2019s not easy for me to accept it.\u201d Indeed, he went to great pains in Downfall to show Hitler as a tormented and nuanced individual racked with insecurities and quivering with tremors from Parkinson\u2019s. Joachim Fest, the German historian whose book Inside Hitler\u2019s Bunker was one of the film\u2019s source materials, said of Ganz\u2019s performance: \u201cThat really is Hitler.\u201d Ganz was born in Zurich, the son of a Swiss mechanic and his northern Italian wife. As a teenager he attended drama school and later worked as a bookseller, as well as training to be a paramedic. He left Switzerland in the early 1960s to become a stage performer in G\u00f6ttingen and Bremen, playing Hamlet in 1965, a role he was to reprise 17 years later. In 1970 he co-founded with Peter Stein the alternative theatre company Schaub\u00fchne. \u201cClearly we were actors and theatre people, but we understood ourselves as being part of 1968,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was definitely leftwing theatre.\u201d Some of their productions were adapted for television, such as Brecht\u2019s Die Mutter and Ibsen\u2019s Peer Gynt (both 1971), but it was Ganz\u2019s performance in the 1976 television version of Max Gorky\u2019s Summerfolk that launched his wider film and TV career. In the same year he starred in Eric Rohmer\u2019s 18th-century drama The Marquise of O. After The American Friend, he was cast alongside Laurence Olivier and Gregory Peck in the trashy Nazi-hunting thriller The Boys from Brazil (1978) and as Jonathan Harker in Werner Herzog\u2019s brooding Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979), opposite Klaus Kinski in the title role. He was a journalist reporting on the Lebanese civil war in Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff\u2019s Circle of Deceit (1981) and a dying writer in Theo Angelopoulos\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or-winning Eternity and a Day (1998). In 1996 he became only the fifth actor in more than a century to receive the illustrious Iffland-Ring, given to the \u201cmost significant and most worthy actor of the German-speaking theatre\u201d. He won the Donatello award for the gentle Italian comedy-drama Bread and Tulips (2000), and was also seen in Jonathan Demme\u2019s remake of The Manchurian Candidate (2004), Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s eccentric fantasy Youth Without Youth (2007), the thriller The Baader Meinhof Complex and the Oscar-winning Holocaust drama The Reader (both 2008). In 2002 he was the subject of a documentary, Behind Me, which captured him at work on Stein\u2019s ambitious 15-hour staging of both parts of Goethe\u2019s Faust, in which the roles of Faust and Mephistopheles were each split between two actors. Ganz and Christian Nickel shared Faust, though it was the former, with 75% of the dialogue, who was generally agreed to be the production\u2019s dominant force. During rehearsals he fell off a ladder, breaking his wrist and pelvis and missing the July 2000 premiere in Hanover but rejoining it in Berlin at the end of the year. The production was disliked by German critics, though Ganz was singled out for praise. \u201cLike the greatest singers, [he] understands how to bring the well-known tones to new, spontaneous life,\u201d said Frank Busch in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. Ganz was an actor who never failed to raise the quality of the films in which he appeared, no matter how small the role. Among notable recent work was Unknown (2011), where he played an ex-Stasi officer and brought to this ludicrous Liam Neeson thriller a dose of gravitas and dignity, not least in a poignant scene with Frank Langella as the operative who means to kill him. In The Counselor (2013), directed by Ridley Scott from a script by the novelist Cormac McCarthy, he was a jeweller with a nice line in ruminative patter: \u201cTo enhance the beauty of the beloved is to acknowledge both her frailty and the nobility of that frailty,\u201d he tells a customer. In Sally Potter\u2019s spiky comedy The Party (2017) he was amusing as the wishy-washy life coach and healer forever being disparaged by his wife (Patricia Clarkson). And in Lars von Trier\u2019s gruesome drama The House That Jack Built (2018), he played Virgil (\u201cVirge\u201d for short), who guides a serial killer (Matt Dillon) through purgatory. His soothing tones were heard throughout the movie, though his face was not shown until the final sequence. One of the last films he appeared in was Radegund, the story of a German conscientious objector in the second world war, directed by Terrence Malick in 2017 and apparently still in its lengthy post-production process. He is survived by his partner, the photographer Ruth Walz, and a son, Daniel, from his marriage to Sabine. The couple married in 1965, and though separated were not divorced. \u2022 Bruno Ganz, actor, born 22 March 1941; died 15 February 2019",

      "bodyText": "It has no name, no logo, no staff and no money. Yet those who packed into the tiny room above Westminster Bridge as seven MPs announced they were quitting the Labour party were left in no doubt that this was the beginning of a new political party. \u201cThe crucial word is yet,\u201d one of the MPs said afterwards. \u201cWe are not a new party \u2013 yet.\u201d As of Monday, the group are independents with no special status in the House of Commons. They hope to be something much more concrete, depending on their success in persuading other MPs to join them. In the short term the group has one central task \u2013 to convince 29 more disgruntled MPs from any party colour to join their group. If they then became an official party they would overtake the SNP giving them the likelihood of a prized guaranteed slot for the group\u2019s leader at every PMQs, replacing the SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford. A new party would not, however, qualify for \u201cShort money\u201d funding \u2013 which is allocated after elections to parties meeting certain eligibility criteria. Those MPs involved in the new group\u2019s organisation stress that they hope this week will be dominated by several news cycles\u2019 worth of new developments, including an expectation of more defections. If they do not materialise, the group will find it hard to maintain momentum. Two names mentioned as the most likely Conservative targets are the Tory MPs Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston, both independent-minded and supporters of the People\u2019s Vote campaign. The most crucial name on the list of seven is Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree who has faced a slew of antisemitic abuse including death threats that have seen more than one abuser put behind bars. Berger, who is nine months pregnant, had not often been talked about in the same breath as MPs like Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie who have been on the brink of quitting for many months over the party\u2019s Brexit policy. Yet it was she who strode into the room first and chaired the event, looking the most like the group\u2019s leader. The group will meet later this week to decide how to structure their group \u2013 which could involve a process for selecting a leader. Much of the future will depend how many more MPs join them. Labour MPs have been grappling with how to respond \u2013 particularly with the departure of Berger over antisemitism. One MP close to Berger suggested last week that they would find it hard not to follow her out the door. \u201cIf we have said time and again we have standing in solidarity with her over antisemitism, what does it count for if she leaves and we stay?\u201d the MP said. Another senior Labour MP said there were several more MPs on the brink of resigning \u2013 and that 12 had originally been committed to joining the group. He said Corbyn\u2019s reaction had basically been \u201ca declaration of war rather than conciliatory, with no acknowledgement at all that there is a problem in the culture of the Labour party\u201d. For now, the Labour leadership is not outwardly concerned by the resignations. Those close to Corbyn feel that the MPs quitting are hardly household names \u2013 unlike the former cabinet ministers who left to join the SDP in 1981. There is also scepticism that the policy positioning of those leaving the party will appeal to an electorate that they believe has rejected \u201ccentrist, Blairite\u201d values. Multiple MPs said their response would be governed by Corbyn\u2019s own reaction, including his response to deselection attempts and attacks on social media. A hardline response would prompt more to depart, many MPs said. Yet others are cautious about the effect of more resignations on the success of the People\u2019s Vote campaign \u2013 mostly because the \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote\u201d campaign would become closely associated with a group opposed to Labour. Pro-EU MPs are concerned at the loss of their colleagues for the organisation of the anti-Brexit movement pushing for a second referendum in Labour. The internal party WhatsApp groups have already been reorganised, cutting out Leslie, Umunna and the others who have been instrumental in shaping pro-EU arguments and parliamentary tactics. The official People\u2019s Vote campaign moved at lightning speed to distance themselves from the new movement \u2013 despite being associated with all of its MPs. One of the MPs involved said they had not discussed their departures in official People\u2019s Vote campaign meetings, for fear of hostile leaking. Privately, some organisers are furious and say that the splitters could irreparably damage their relationship with left-wing groups and the Labour leadership. Questions are also likely to be asked about other Labour MPs currently sitting as independents, as well as fierce Corbynsceptics who are deeply opposed to a second referendum. MPs at the launch dodged the prospect of others like John Woodcock and Ivan Lewis joining the grouping \u2013 both Corbyn critics who quit the party after being suspended over sexual harassment allegations. Frank Field, who also quit the party in disgust at antisemitism allegations and a no confidence vote by his constituents, is a determined Brexiter who has backed the government\u2019s exit deal. At the moment, all members of the new grouping are supporters of a second referendum. Yet sources suggested this would not necessarily be a prerequisite forever.

      "body": "<p>It takes a lot to anger the unfailingly polite, anglophile Japanese. But Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, and Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, appear to have managed it with their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9cd62bde-32ba-11e9-bd3a-8b2a211d90d5\">ill-judged attempt</a> to hustle Tokyo into a quick-fire Brexit trade deal.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/18/japan-almost-cancelled-brexit-talks-high-handed-letter-liam-fox-jeremy-hunt\">diplomatic fumble</a> has highlighted rapidly escalating difficulties facing \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/global-britain-delivering-on-our-international-ambition\">global Britain</a>\u201d \u2013 the government\u2019s nebulous vision for life after the EU \u2013 in forging new business and trade relationships around the world without an agreed post-Brexit strategy.</p> <p>Leading Brexiters such as Fox, David Davis and Nigel Farage predicted the process would be quick and easy, but events are proving them wrong. With 29 March fast approaching, Britain has replaced only seven of the EU\u2019s 69 collective preferential trade deals.</p> <p>The \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d comprise Switzerland, Chile, Mauritius, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, the Faroe Islands and the Seychelles. Together, they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/13/brexit-uk-trade-deals-eu\">account for a mere \u00a316bn</a> out of a total of \u00a3117bn in British trade with EU-partnered countries.</p> <p>In contrast, preferential arrangements with bigger EU partners such as Japan, South Korea, Turkey and Norway have not been replaced, nor does it appear they will be before the deadline.</p> <p>With market analysts warning a no-deal Brexit is a growing possibility, pressure on Fox is intensifying. This may explain last week\u2019s clumsy warning to Japan, in a letter co-authored with Hunt, that \u201ctime is of the essence\u201d.</p> <p>Like his predecessors, Shinz\u014d Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, has pursued a close diplomatic and security relationship with Britain. Japanese businesses and carmakers have invested heavily.

      "bodyText": "It takes a lot to anger the unfailingly polite, anglophile Japanese. But Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, and Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, appear to have managed it with their ill-judged attempt to hustle Tokyo into a quick-fire Brexit trade deal. The diplomatic fumble has highlighted rapidly escalating difficulties facing \u201cglobal Britain\u201d \u2013 the government\u2019s nebulous vision for life after the EU \u2013 in forging new business and trade relationships around the world without an agreed post-Brexit strategy. Leading Brexiters such as Fox, David Davis and Nigel Farage predicted the process would be quick and easy, but events are proving them wrong. With 29 March fast approaching, Britain has replaced only seven of the EU\u2019s 69 collective preferential trade deals. The \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d comprise Switzerland, Chile, Mauritius, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, the Faroe Islands and the Seychelles. Together, they account for a mere \u00a316bn out of a total of \u00a3117bn in British trade with EU-partnered countries. In contrast, preferential arrangements with bigger EU partners such as Japan, South Korea, Turkey and Norway have not been replaced, nor does it appear they will be before the deadline. With market analysts warning a no-deal Brexit is a growing possibility, pressure on Fox is intensifying. This may explain last week\u2019s clumsy warning to Japan, in a letter co-authored with Hunt, that \u201ctime is of the essence\u201d. Like his predecessors, Shinz\u014d Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, has pursued a close diplomatic and security relationship with Britain. Japanese businesses and carmakers have invested heavily. So officials in Tokyo reportedly took strong exception to the Fox-Hunt suggestion of foot-dragging, suggesting it smacked of arrogance. Fox was already struggling with tougher than expected Japanese negotiating tactics. Given widespread perceptions of British weakness, bordering on desperation, other countries, less well disposed than Japan, can be expected to take an even harder line. The question of ministerial incompetence aside, Britain is further disadvantaged by a lack of trade talks specialists \u2013 a point made by the Japanese \u2013 and ongoing domestic political divisions. Add to that well-founded concerns about a contracting global economy, the US-China trade war and a broader sense that Britain\u2019s standing on the world stage is in decline, and the future negotiating environment looks hostile. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, served up what he and others among Britain\u2019s European friends see as an unpalatable truth. Britain is \u201ca waning country\u201d that is \u201ctoo small to appear on the world stage on its own\u201d, he said last week. All this renders the task of creating new bilateral trade deals with the world\u2019s largest economies, outside the EU\u2019s 69-nation umbrella framework, ever more daunting. China\u2019s weekend decision to cancel high-levels talks over disobliging remarks by the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, showed how vulnerable Britain is to geopolitical as well as financial pressure from the big emerging powers. The UK\u2019s dependence on Chinese investment, for example in nuclear power, is another weakness open to exploitation. Britain\u2019s refusal to ostracise the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei may please Beijing but will infuriate the US. Was the decision influenced by Brexit considerations? There could also be a high price to pay, in terms of political values and human rights, in obtaining deals from repressive regimes in China, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. And Britain\u2019s often unhappy colonial legacy must be factored in, too. Many in India will view London\u2019s new neediness as a chance to redress old wrongs. For his part, Donald Trump, a Brexit enthusiast, has criticised May for conceding too much to the EU while promising an expanded relationship. The US is already Britain\u2019s biggest non-EU trade partner, and London clings rather pathetically to its so-called special relationship. Money-minded, hard-nosed Trump is certain to drive a hard bargain, and there\u2019s a real risk of bullying. Any agreement with the US could come with political as well as commercial and health and safety strings attached, for instance on Iran, where current policy diverges. Trump\u2019s deep hostility to to the World Trade Organization (\u201cone of the worst deals ever\u201d) means, meanwhile, that a no-deal default to WTO rules would not necessarily win Washington\u2019s approval or support. Such an outcome would truly leave Britain all at sea, lost and adrift somewhere between Europe and America.",

Appearance: As soon as the next working day, as long as you are over 18, have a NatWest current account and aren\u2019t vegan. Sorry, NatWest doesn\u2019t give loans to vegans? Well, it has previously made it difficult. When? In January, apparently, when a customer rang up seeking a loan to cover the cost of a vegan nutrition course. She was turned down. What made her suspect the refusal had anything to do with her being vegan? The bank employee dropped a few hints, according to the woman. What sort of hints? \u201cI told him I was an active vegan,\u201d she told BBC Radio Bristol. \u201cAnd he proceeded to tell me that all vegans should be punched in the face.\u201d Yes, that is quite a strong hint. I thought it just went by your credit score. To be clear: this is not NatWest policy. It seem this particular employee held a bit of a grudge. Why does he hate vegans so much? Because of chalk activism, apparently. Because of what? He claimed that vegan campaigners were chalking messages on to the pavement \u2013 drawings of animals alongside slogans such as \u201cFriends Not Food\u201d \u2013 near his house. And these chalk drawings sent him into a face-punching rage? He felt the vegans were unfairly forcing their beliefs on to him. Imagine what they could do if they were allowed to take out loans. \u201cWhen you\u2019re calling up a really big organisation like NatWest, you just don\u2019t expect that kind of response,\u201d said the woman. It is certainly an argument for applying online in future \u2013 using a different bank. Well, for what it\u2019s worth, NatWest is very sorry. It described the comments as \u201cwholly inappropriate\u201d and has commenced disciplinary proceedings. I should think so. And it offered the woman \u2013 who has chosen to remain anonymous \u2013 \u00a3400 to cover the cost of the course, plus compensation in the weirdly specific amount of \u00a3185. I have one word to say to that: result. The bank also promises to \u201censure that lessons are learned so that a situation like this never happens again\u201d. Because otherwise it could get expensive. Do say: \u201cWhile such bigotry is never acceptable, this is a clear victory for the 600,000 Britons who identify as vegan.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cHey NatWest \u2013 for \u00a3585 I\u2019ll come down there and let you punch me in the face right now!\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>ROMANCE AND SAUCE</strong></h2> <p>Following a weekend of FA Cup ties that produced no upsets whatsoever, it is left to the plucky minnows of Chelsea to go all Mills &amp; Boon on the fifth-round romance stakes by slaying Manchester United at Stamford Bridge. Two places and one point behind United in the English league pyramid, it has been left to this rag-tag collection of butchers, carpenters and postmen \u2013 or, at the very least, multi-millionaire footballers who may know their local butcher, carpenter or postman \u2013 to fly the flag for the little guy when United\u2019s juggernaut rolls up with a place in the quarter-finals at stake.</p> <p>Their managers could scarcely be more different but there is a lot at stake for both. In the red corner we have a likable and enthusiastic young Scandinavian pixie looking to stay in one of the biggest jobs in English management despite a recent sobering defeat. In the blue corner is an equally likable but considerably older and more world-weary, Italian chain-smoker looking to stay in one of the biggest jobs in English management despite a recent sobering defeat. And with new FA Cup rules dictating that this tie is guaranteed to play out to a finish, it seems a certainty that Tuesday\u2019s headlines are guaranteed to riff, be-bop and scat all over either Ole Gunnar<em><strong> </strong></em>Solskj\u00e6r or Maurizio Sarri\u2019s latest setback.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/17/alexis-sanchez-chelsea-manchester-united-preview\">Alexis S\u00e1nchez goals will start to flow like ketchup, says Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial both out with knack, Solskj\u00e6r must decide whether or not to start with Alexis S\u00e1nchez, an ivory-tinkler so out of form that in his last appearance he didn\u2019t so much resemble a footballer as a particularly poorly co-ordinated supporter who\u2019d won a Uefa competition where the first prize was the chance to play 41 minutes of Big Cup for the team of their choice against PSG. In the build-up to the game, the Chilean\u2019s manager attempted to boost his player\u2019s morale by likening him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/17/alexis-sanchez-chelsea-manchester-united-preview\">to a condiment</a>, specifically one of those bottles of ketchup you tend to get in low-rent greasy spoon cafes.</p> <p>\u201cYou know that bottle of ketchup that you squeeze when it never comes out \u2013 but when it suddenly comes there\u2019s loads?\u201d he tooted. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d While Ole\u2019s analogy works up to a point, the Manchester United interim manager appeared to be working on the assumption there is still plenty of ketchup left in his particular bottle, something that most available recent evidence suggests is not the case. If his boss decides to gamble on shaking him and giving him a vigorous pat before such an important game, S\u00e1nchez seriously needs to hit the breakfast plate running.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Jacob Steinberg from 7.30pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Chelsea 1-2 Manchester United, followed by the FA Cup quarter-final draw</a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cHaving joined the EFL as CEO in October 2013, I am proud of what we have achieved since then\u201d \u2013 The Fiver confesses it\u2019s not exactly sure what these things are that outgoing chief suit Shaun Harvey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/18/shaun-harvey-step-down-football-league-chief-executive\">is talking about</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1509fceb8fcb6ca192927b5e5d03e6e7d3e72765\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1509fceb8fcb6ca192927b5e5d03e6e7d3e72765/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ooh, it\u2019s the magic of the Checkatrade Trophy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ooh, it\u2019s the magic of the Checkatrade Trophy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>RECOMMENDED LISTENING</h2> <p>Football Weekly will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/footballweekly\">in this general area</a>.</p> <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>\u201cAs a Yank who succumbed to the lures of the Premier League 10 years ago, and who tripped upon The Fiver somewhat more recently, I\u2019ve noticed a trend in letters to kick The Fiver when its humour quotient is down.

      "bodyText": "ROMANCE AND SAUCE Following a weekend of FA Cup ties that produced no upsets whatsoever, it is left to the plucky minnows of Chelsea to go all Mills &amp; Boon on the fifth-round romance stakes by slaying Manchester United at Stamford Bridge. Two places and one point behind United in the English league pyramid, it has been left to this rag-tag collection of butchers, carpenters and postmen \u2013 or, at the very least, multi-millionaire footballers who may know their local butcher, carpenter or postman \u2013 to fly the flag for the little guy when United\u2019s juggernaut rolls up with a place in the quarter-finals at stake. Their managers could scarcely be more different but there is a lot at stake for both. In the red corner we have a likable and enthusiastic young Scandinavian pixie looking to stay in one of the biggest jobs in English management despite a recent sobering defeat. In the blue corner is an equally likable but considerably older and more world-weary, Italian chain-smoker looking to stay in one of the biggest jobs in English management despite a recent sobering defeat. And with new FA Cup rules dictating that this tie is guaranteed to play out to a finish, it seems a certainty that Tuesday\u2019s headlines are guaranteed to riff, be-bop and scat all over either Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r or Maurizio Sarri\u2019s latest setback. With Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial both out with knack, Solskj\u00e6r must decide whether or not to start with Alexis S\u00e1nchez, an ivory-tinkler so out of form that in his last appearance he didn\u2019t so much resemble a footballer as a particularly poorly co-ordinated supporter who\u2019d won a Uefa competition where the first prize was the chance to play 41 minutes of Big Cup for the team of their choice against PSG. In the build-up to the game, the Chilean\u2019s manager attempted to boost his player\u2019s morale by likening him to a condiment, specifically one of those bottles of ketchup you tend to get in low-rent greasy spoon cafes. \u201cYou know that bottle of ketchup that you squeeze when it never comes out \u2013 but when it suddenly comes there\u2019s loads?\u201d he tooted. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d While Ole\u2019s analogy works up to a point, the Manchester United interim manager appeared to be working on the assumption there is still plenty of ketchup left in his particular bottle, something that most available recent evidence suggests is not the case. If his boss decides to gamble on shaking him and giving him a vigorous pat before such an important game, S\u00e1nchez seriously needs to hit the breakfast plate running.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cHaving joined the EFL as CEO in October 2013, I am proud of what we have achieved since then\u201d \u2013 The Fiver confesses it\u2019s not exactly sure what these things are that outgoing chief suit Shaun Harvey is talking about. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Football Weekly will be in this general area. FIVER LETTERS \u201cAs a Yank who succumbed to the lures of the Premier League 10 years ago, and who tripped upon The Fiver somewhat more recently, I\u2019ve noticed a trend in letters to kick The Fiver when its humour quotient is down. Sure, you may get a queazy feeling when it arrives in your inbox, blanche at the prospect of more bad puns, and come to loathe its very existence by the time you finish with Bits and Bobs, but what would you do at 4 o\u2019clock-ish each afternoon if you didn\u2019t have The Fiver to kick around anymore. The Fiver is the Richard Nixon of tea-timely football emails. Let\u2019s all hope The Fiver follows his example, and, like Ramires and Oscar, goes to China\u201d \u2013 Tim Travelstead. \u201cWhat with UK GDP falling in December, slowing to 0.2% in 2018 Q4 and Brexit next month, it\u2019s good to see that macroeconomists over at the Bank of England have nothing better to do than explain: \u2018Why football players are paid so much?\u2019 Spoiler alert: there\u2019s lots of TV money and not many Leo Messis. That\u2019s all very well but it doesn\u2019t explain most of the Manchester United squad\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. \u201cI can\u2019t believe anyone was foolish enough to ask Dormund\u2019s chief suit if the players having a trim before the game was partly responsible for their trouncing by Spurs (Friday\u2019s Quote of the Day). After all there\u2019s no precedent whatsoever for such a theor \u2026 ah\u201d \u2013 John Myles. \u201cMark Dean\u2019s letter about Valentine\u2019s Day football (Friday\u2019s Fiver letters) reminds me of a romantic gesture of my own. On Valentine\u2019s Day 2004, the first since getting married, I told my wife Louise that I\u2019d got diamonds for her. That day\u2019s Chesterfield v Rushden &amp; Diamonds fixture is the last Spireites match she ever went to. But we are still married\u201d \u2013 David Ede. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 David Ede, who wins Welcome to the Blue Heaven: Jimmy Nielsen with Paolo Bandini! Plenty more prizes to come. BITS AND BOBS Kilmarnock\u2019s Kris Boyd has criticised Queen\u2019s Celtic supporters after being struck by a coin during Sunday\u2019s late defeat at Rugby Park. \u201cWe\u2019re led to believe they\u2019re the Greatest Fans in the World,\u201d he posted on Social Media Disgrace Instachat. \u201cWrecking seats, flares and invading the park. Oh, and in case anyone didn\u2019t know, I\u2019m just a fat orange (it must just be my favourite colour) b******. The shouts and abuse I can handle as a bit of banter even [if to] others it would be sectarianism. Getting hit with a coin, though, is a step too far.\u201d J\u00fcrgen Klopp has no doubt that Liverpool fans would prefer winning the Premier League to Big Cup as he prepares to face Bayern Munich. \u201cNow we play [Big Cup] and we all expect we will do our best,\u201d he blared. \u201cAnd thank God we don\u2019t have to make that decision.\u201d West Ham have written to supporters, telling them of plans to move London Stadium seats into the same timezone as the pitch. \u201cMy team and I have been working hard in the background with stadium management, mindful that seating is something supporters wanted us to explore and we have listened,\u201d cheered Karren Brady. Paraguay have appointed Eduardo Berizzo as their new manager. And Pro Piacenza were only able to field seven players \u2013 six teenagers plus the 39-year-old team masseur \u2013 for their Serie C game at Cuneo. They duly lost 20-0. STILL WANT MORE?

      "body": "<p>There are a handful of obvious questions anyone should be asking when presented with a wine list. But unless \u2013 like Cristiano Ronaldo during his recent visit to glitzy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/15/a-day-in-the-life-of-scotts-mayfair-britains-grandest-restaurant\" title=\"\">Mayfair seafood restaurant Scott\u2019s</a> \u2013 you\u2019re untroubled by the prospect of shelling out \u00a318,000 for a bottle of Richebourg Grand Cru, the most pressing will always be: \u201cHow much do I want to spend here?\u201d</p> <p>Being clear \u2013 and firm \u2013 about your budget will curb any urge on the part of your sommelier to \u2013 in the industry lingo \u2013 \u201cupsell\u201d you something you can\u2019t afford. And, contrary to stubborn popular belief, if that budget only stretches as far as the house wine (or that ever-popular \u201csecond-cheapest wine on the list\u201d) that needn\u2019t mean you\u2019re in for a night of bad plonk and disdain. Whether it\u2019s part of a pizza chain or Michelin-starred, any decent restaurant will know that the house wines are their most important bottles, the ones by which customers will judge them. Consequently, they put a lot of effort into getting them right, and are proud of them.</p> <p>If, though, you\u2019re splashing out, always beware the vintage. The majority of the world\u2019s most expensive wines have earned their reputations at least in part through their ability to age; there\u2019s little point shelling out a fortune on a wine so young (less than a decade old in the case of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/27/the-best-bordeaux-reds-wines-france\" title=\"\">top reds of Bordeaux</a>, Burgundy or Barolo) that it has yet to show off the qualities that will one day make it truly special.</p> <p>Equally, there\u2019s no point wasting money on a gorgeously subtle wine if you\u2019re going to swamp it with chilli, sugar, vinegar or other wine-troubling ingredients such as artichokes. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/20/sommeliers-rock-stars-of-food-djs\" title=\"\">good sommelier</a> will help you avoid that kind of clash, with the by-the-glass list (massively improved in quality, range and value in most restaurants in recent years) often the source of the most creative \u2013 and economic \u2013 solutions.</p> <p>But if you\u2019re in a sommelier-free zone and on your own with the list, it\u2019s worth remembering that some wines are more versatile than others. Lighter, fresh reds (such as beaujolais or Loire cabernet franc), richer whites (such as Rh\u00f4ne-style blends, whether from southern France or South Africa) and fino sherry are, in my experience, among the wines best placed to match a table of different dishes and people \u2013 without, of course, breaking the bank.</p> <h2><em>The modern British restaurant</em></h2> <p><em>Starter: Crab, celeriac, almond</em></p> <p><em>Main: Pheasant, leek and truffle pie</em></p> <p><em>Dessert: British cheeses, crab apple and oa</em><em>tcakes</em></p> <p>The impeccably sourced ingredients, understated cheffy skill and carefully cultivated informality of ambience that characterise the hipper restaurants of London, Edinburgh and Manchester are perfect matches for certain kinds of modern wine.</p> <p>Made by people who are either believers in, or sympathetic to, the back-to-basics, back-to-the-land philosophy of the natural wine scene, these are wines that put a premium on drinkability and food compatibility: qualities not always apparent in the kind of glossy, showy, super-ripe, super-oaky tipples that once dominated the vinous mainstream.</p> <p>Go by the glass or pitcher, and ask your sommelier to recommend a p\u00e9tillant naturel (p\u00e9t-nat)<em> </em>sparkler from the Loire as an aperitif; an orange wine from Friuli in north-east Italy or from Georgia to pair with the crab, celeriac and almond; and a natural cinsault from the Languedoc or South Africa to go with the pheasant, leek and truffle pie. To finish: see what kind of age-dated sherry, madeira or marsala they\u2019ve got to match those British cheeses.</p> <h2><em>The high-street chain</em></h2> <p><em>Starter: Houmous with peri-peri drizzle</em></p> <p><em>Main: </em><em>Chicken wings in peri-peri sauce</em></p> <p><em>Dessert: Salted caramel brownie</em></p> <p>The essence of restaurants such as Nando\u2019s is basically twofold: chicken and spicy peri-peri sauce of various degrees of heat. And it\u2019s the second of those two elements that would be most influential in informing what to drink in this case.</p> <p>Chilli heat works well with wines containing a little sugar \u2013 it\u2019s the same principle that goes into the mixing of palm or coconut sugar with chilli in Thai and other south-east Asian cuisines. Not too much sugar: we\u2019re not talking sticky dessert wines, which, with as much as 200g per litre, would be overwhelming. And not too light: the filigree off-dry riesling whites found in Germany\u2019s Mosel region would be blown away by the umami and fatty richness of the chicken.</p> <p>I\u2019m thinking more of the fuller-bodied kind of off-dry white styles found in Alsace, or Alsace-inspired wines made using the same grape varieties, such as pinot gris and gew\u00fcrztraminer, in New Zealand, Chile, California and elsewhere.</p> <p>And not just in Nando\u2019s. These are wines that work well anywhere that spice is in the mix: from your local Thai or curry house, to Peruvian, Korean and Szechuan Chinese.</p> <h2><em>The classic French restaurant</em></h2> <p><em>Starter: Coquille St</em><em> Jacques in the shell with prawns</em></p> <p><em>Main: Rack of lamb with herbs served with </em><em>mint sauce, redcurrant </em><em>jelly</em></p> <p><em>Dessert: Raspberry millefeuille</em></p> <p>According to an age-old and generally reliable piece of wine-and-food-matching advice: what grows together, goes together. All of which would suggest that classic French restaurants demand classic French wines. Indeed, in most such places that will be pretty much all you\u2019re offered.</p> <p>Given that, among others, pinot noir from coastal California, Oregon and New Zealand can be just as refined as that from Burgundy; and given that you can find cabernet and merlot-based wines in Napa, the Tuscan coast and South America that live up to the best of Bordeaux, it\u2019s worth asking if the sommelier has any international surprises (which may well be competitively priced) up their sleeves.</p> <p>If it has to be French, you could ask whether they have a good-quality, aged muscadet in lieu of more expensive chablis for the coquilles St Jacques, and you may find that a spicy Languedoc red will be the most economically delicious \u2013 and traditional \u2013 pairing for a rack of lamb.</p> <p>And to partner the raspberry millefeuille, ask for the by-the-glass list and see if they have such great value sweet wines as montbazillac or juran\u00e7on from France\u2019s often-overlooked south-west.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There are a handful of obvious questions anyone should be asking when presented with a wine list. But unless \u2013 like Cristiano Ronaldo during his recent visit to glitzy Mayfair seafood restaurant Scott\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re untroubled by the prospect of shelling out \u00a318,000 for a bottle of Richebourg Grand Cru, the most pressing will always be: \u201cHow much do I want to spend here?\u201d Being clear \u2013 and firm \u2013 about your budget will curb any urge on the part of your sommelier to \u2013 in the industry lingo \u2013 \u201cupsell\u201d you something you can\u2019t afford. And, contrary to stubborn popular belief, if that budget only stretches as far as the house wine (or that ever-popular \u201csecond-cheapest wine on the list\u201d) that needn\u2019t mean you\u2019re in for a night of bad plonk and disdain. Whether it\u2019s part of a pizza chain or Michelin-starred, any decent restaurant will know that the house wines are their most important bottles, the ones by which customers will judge them. Consequently, they put a lot of effort into getting them right, and are proud of them. If, though, you\u2019re splashing out, always beware the vintage. The majority of the world\u2019s most expensive wines have earned their reputations at least in part through their ability to age; there\u2019s little point shelling out a fortune on a wine so young (less than a decade old in the case of the top reds of Bordeaux, Burgundy or Barolo) that it has yet to show off the qualities that will one day make it truly special. Equally, there\u2019s no point wasting money on a gorgeously subtle wine if you\u2019re going to swamp it with chilli, sugar, vinegar or other wine-troubling ingredients such as artichokes. A good sommelier will help you avoid that kind of clash, with the by-the-glass list (massively improved in quality, range and value in most restaurants in recent years) often the source of the most creative \u2013 and economic \u2013 solutions. But if you\u2019re in a sommelier-free zone and on your own with the list, it\u2019s worth remembering that some wines are more versatile than others. Lighter, fresh reds (such as beaujolais or Loire cabernet franc), richer whites (such as Rh\u00f4ne-style blends, whether from southern France or South Africa) and fino sherry are, in my experience, among the wines best placed to match a table of different dishes and people \u2013 without, of course, breaking the bank. The modern British restaurant Starter: Crab, celeriac, almond Main: Pheasant, leek and truffle pie Dessert: British cheeses, crab apple and oatcakes The impeccably sourced ingredients, understated cheffy skill and carefully cultivated informality of ambience that characterise the hipper restaurants of London, Edinburgh and Manchester are perfect matches for certain kinds of modern wine. Made by people who are either believers in, or sympathetic to, the back-to-basics, back-to-the-land philosophy of the natural wine scene, these are wines that put a premium on drinkability and food compatibility: qualities not always apparent in the kind of glossy, showy, super-ripe, super-oaky tipples that once dominated the vinous mainstream. Go by the glass or pitcher, and ask your sommelier to recommend a p\u00e9tillant naturel (p\u00e9t-nat) sparkler from the Loire as an aperitif; an orange wine from Friuli in north-east Italy or from Georgia to pair with the crab, celeriac and almond; and a natural cinsault from the Languedoc or South Africa to go with the pheasant, leek and truffle pie. To finish: see what kind of age-dated sherry, madeira or marsala they\u2019ve got to match those British cheeses. The high-street chain Starter: Houmous with peri-peri drizzle Main: Chicken wings in peri-peri sauce Dessert: Salted caramel brownie The essence of restaurants such as Nando\u2019s is basically twofold: chicken and spicy peri-peri sauce of various degrees of heat. And it\u2019s the second of those two elements that would be most influential in informing what to drink in this case. Chilli heat works well with wines containing a little sugar \u2013 it\u2019s the same principle that goes into the mixing of palm or coconut sugar with chilli in Thai and other south-east Asian cuisines. Not too much sugar: we\u2019re not talking sticky dessert wines, which, with as much as 200g per litre, would be overwhelming. And not too light: the filigree off-dry riesling whites found in Germany\u2019s Mosel region would be blown away by the umami and fatty richness of the chicken. I\u2019m thinking more of the fuller-bodied kind of off-dry white styles found in Alsace, or Alsace-inspired wines made using the same grape varieties, such as pinot gris and gew\u00fcrztraminer, in New Zealand, Chile, California and elsewhere. And not just in Nando\u2019s. These are wines that work well anywhere that spice is in the mix: from your local Thai or curry house, to Peruvian, Korean and Szechuan Chinese. The classic French restaurant Starter: Coquille St Jacques in the shell with prawns Main: Rack of lamb with herbs served with mint sauce, redcurrant jelly Dessert: Raspberry millefeuille According to an age-old and generally reliable piece of wine-and-food-matching advice: what grows together, goes together. All of which would suggest that classic French restaurants demand classic French wines. Indeed, in most such places that will be pretty much all you\u2019re offered. Given that, among others, pinot noir from coastal California, Oregon and New Zealand can be just as refined as that from Burgundy; and given that you can find cabernet and merlot-based wines in Napa, the Tuscan coast and South America that live up to the best of Bordeaux, it\u2019s worth asking if the sommelier has any international surprises (which may well be competitively priced) up their sleeves. If it has to be French, you could ask whether they have a good-quality, aged muscadet in lieu of more expensive chablis for the coquilles St Jacques, and you may find that a spicy Languedoc red will be the most economically delicious \u2013 and traditional \u2013 pairing for a rack of lamb. And to partner the raspberry millefeuille, ask for the by-the-glass list and see if they have such great value sweet wines as montbazillac or juran\u00e7on from France\u2019s often-overlooked south-west.",

Six years later, the trial of nine people accused of being part of a drug smuggling operation began in Aix-en-Provence, southern France, on Monday. Among the accused were two former French military pilots, a customs officer and a celebrity bodyguard. All of the accused deny involvement in drug smuggling in a case that has come to be known as the \u201cAir Cocaine\u201d affair. Suspicion was first raised in 2012 when French gendarmes received an anonymous tip suggesting the Falcon 50 had made two transatlantic trips suspected to be trial runs for a smuggling operation. When Dominican police halted a flight in March 2013, the two pilots, Pascal Fauret, 58, and Bruno Odos, 59, as well as the two passengers, Alain Castany, 71, a former pilot and described as the \u201cowner\u201d of the suitcases, and Nicolas Pisapia, the \u201cbag carrier\u201d, were arrested. But the drama did not end there. After a Dominican court sentenced the four men to 20 years in prison in August 2015, they were released and given leave to appeal while placed under house arrest. Shortly afterwards, Fauret and Odos escaped with the help of friends in what they called \u201cOperation D\u00eener en Ville\u201d (dinner in town), making their getaway by speedboat then yacht to the French-Dutch island of Saint Martin and on to Fort-de-France, the capital of the French island Martinique. They arrived back in mainland France in the autumn of 2015, where they were arrested. Also in the dock are Franck Colin, a former celebrity bodyguard turned businessman based in Romania, and his friend Henri Bartolo. Ali Bouchareb, from Lyon, accused of masterminding the flight, appears alongside his associate Michel Ristic and two former executives of the defunct private jet company SN-THS, Fabrice Alcaud and Pierre-Marc Dreyfus. The final defendant is Saint-Tropez customs officer Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Manchet. Castany, who was transferred to France where he was released because of ill-health, and Pisapia, who remains in the Dominican Republic where he is on parole, will not be in court. The evidence runs to more than 62,000 documents and more than 100 witnesses are expected to be called during the seven-week trial.",

But nearly two-thirds of those offenders go on to commit a further crime within a year of being released. \u201cWhy would we spend taxpayers\u2019 money doing what we know doesn\u2019t work, and indeed, makes us less safe?\u201d He cited the example of female shoplifters jailed for short terms, which often blights their life chances on release. \u201cFor women, going into custody often causes huge disruption to the lives of their families, especially dependent children, increasing the risk [the children] will also fall into offending.\u201d Gauke said tough community orders should be backed up by tagging and could mandate treatment for underlying causes of offending such as alcohol, drugs or mental health issues. Five pilot schemes have been set up. \u201cOur research shows that nearly 60% of recent offenders who engaged with a community-based alcohol programme did not go on to reoffend in the two years following treatment. Offenders given a community sentence including mental health treatment have also shown to be significantly less likely to reoffend.\u201d Sentences had been getting longer, he added. \u201cWe are now taking a more punitive approach than at any point during Mrs Thatcher\u2019s premiership. We should be extremely cautious about continuing to increase sentences as a routine response to concerns over crime. \u201cFor the offenders completing these short sentences whose lives are destabilised, and for society which incurs a heavy financial and social cost, prison simply isn\u2019t working. \u201cThat\u2019s why there is a very strong case to abolish sentences of six months or less altogether, with some closely defined exceptions, and put in their place a robust community order regime.\u201d Gauke challenged the view that prison after conviction should be the only punishment for more serious offences. \u201cI believe we are nearing a time when a combination of technology and radical thinking will make it possible for much more intensive and restrictive conditions to be applied in more creative and fundamental ways outside of prison. \u201cI think for some offenders we need to revisit what effective punishment really means. Home curfew, driving bans, alcohol bans and foreign travel bans are just some of the options that already exist and which might play a bigger role.\u201d He said fraudsters spent a spell in jail but still may enjoy the money they stole on release: \u201cI want to look at what happens after prison \u2013 whether more effective punishment and deterrent for these criminals might involve jail time and more lasting and punitive community interventions.\u201d The Conservative MP Philip Davies branded the plans as \u201cfrankly idiotic\u201d and said: \u201cIn virtually every case, the offender has been given community sentence after community sentence, and they are only sent to prison because they have failed to stop their offending. So to give them community sentences instead is bonkers.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Celta de Vigo\u2019s fans saw hope disappear before their eyes. An hour had gone and Jos\u00e9 Luis Morales had just scored Levante\u2019s third but it wasn\u2019t only what was happening on the pitch that brought the fatalism flooding back at Bala\u00eddos, it was what was happening alongside it. There had been applause and anticipation when Iago Aspas, their captain and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/19/iago-aspas-world-cup-credentials-barcelona-celta-la-liga\">their everything</a>, stepped into the sunlight and began warming up, tracksuit off ready to return after six weeks away; now there was silence as he ducked into the shadows and sat down again, worry and resignation written across his face and theirs.</p> \n<p>Back on the bench, boots off, mission aborted, Aspas watched powerless as the fans clapped Morales and whistled everyone else. He watched team-mates argue over an irrelevant 88th-minute penalty to make it 1-3, the tiniest flicker of life immediately extinguished when Borja Mayoral scored Levante\u2019s fourth seconds later. He listened to supporters call for the president to resign \u2013 which is exactly what Carlos Mouri\u00f1o, pointedly ignoring the mayor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/feb/06/real-madrids-postponed-trip-to-celta-sparks-a-storm-in-la-liga\">up in the directors\u2019 box</a>, would do if he could find someone to pay him enough to buy the club. And he watched another defeat and more disillusion, the final whistle blown to emptying stands. While he watched, he occasionally reached down and rubbed his calf.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1096769317801213952\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">| GOAL! | <br><br>Another beaut of a team goal from Levante to round off a fine win away at Celta Vigo \ud83d\ude8c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LaLiga?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LaLiga</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Qre6F08cYW\">pic.twitter.com/Qre6F08cYW</a></p>\u2014 Eleven Sports (@ElevenSports_UK) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1096769317801213952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 16, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Celta had been beaten again. Sixteenth in the table, this was bad. Vigo\u2019s press summed it up in apocalyptic terms: Celta were \u201cbleeding\u201d, an \u201copen wound\u201d, a \u201cshipwreck,\u201d \u201cpathetic\u201d, \u201cdepressing\u201d. The fans chanted that they were \u201cup to the bollocks\u201d with it all: sick of it. The team is sick too: \u201cin intensive care\u201d, one headline insisted. And it wasn\u2019t about to get better. After the game, manager Miguel Cardoso admitted he hadn\u2019t put Aspas on because as the forward sprinted along the touchline, he felt something in his calf. The next day, the club doctor revealed another muscle tear. \u201cWe\u2019re a bit scared,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/18/mauro-icardi-internazionale-and-the-return-of-unwelcome-headlines\">Mauro Icardi, Internazionale and the return of unwelcome headlines | Paolo Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>They all are. At the same time as the doctor appeared, Girona were completing a historic victory at the Bernab\u00e9u, beating Real Madrid 2-1 \u2013 \u201cApotheosis!\u201d cheered Diari de Girona \u2013 and within a few hours Villarreal had defeated Sevilla 3-0. Those results saw Celta slip to 17th, a point above the relegation zone and with two teams \u2013 Rayo Vallecano and Villarreal \u2013 within a draw of catching them. Below them are Huesca, who are six points back but have a game in hand and, seemingly long gone six weeks ago, have reacted recently. Without a victory since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/aug/20/la-liga-huesca-make-a-sizeable-impact\">the opening day</a>, they have now won three of their last six, two of their last three. And Huesca are not the only ones \u2013 which is part of the point, another reason to be fearful in Vigo, where suddenly they\u2019re not safe from anyone.</p> \n<p>Anything seems possible <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/1097275076926492672\">at the bottom</a>: any three from 10 teams could go down \u2013 Levante in 11th are only seven points off the relegation zone \u2013 in a fight marked by long runs of form, in which a single win can seem to change everything, especially how things feel. Espanyol, within a win of top, then lost nine of 10 matches; Valladolid, quietly impressing everyone at the start, have won <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/27/the-earth-moves-at-valladolid-to-spoil-la-liga-return-against-barcelona\">only one in nine</a>; Athletic, without a win since the opening day, replaced Eduardo Berizzo <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/soccer/spanish-primera-division/15/blog/post/3720725/athletic-bilbao-would-rather-be-relegated-than-compromise-their-values-as-battle-at-bottom-looms\">with Gaizka Garitano</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/dec/24/aritz-aduriz-athletic-bilbao-la-liga\">recovered</a> and have lost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/14/vooooooosh-inaki-williams-and-a-run-like-nobody-has-run-before\">just one in nine</a>; Rayo, deep in trouble having won twice in 16 weeks, went on a run of winning four of five, although they have lost that momentum with three defeats in a row.</p> \n<p>Safety, Celta might have thought, came in other team\u2019s inabilities. But Espanyol have arrested their slide a little, unbeaten in three. More importantly, this weekend Girona and Villarreal finally picked up victories, 11 games later.</p> \n<p>Girona hadn\u2019t been <em>that</em> bad \u2013 they\u2019re the only side to have picked up points against Barcelona, Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico, winning at the Bernab\u00e9u and drawing at the Camp Nou \u2013 but their results had been and the pressure built. \u201cThis week at last we got our reward,\u201d coach Eusebio Sacrist\u00e1n said. At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/dec/17/why-villarreal-are-starting-to-get-that-sinking-feeling-again-la-liga-yellow-submarine\">Villarreal</a>, Javier Calleja <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/04/meet-the-new-villarreal-boss-same-as-the-old-villarreal-boss\">is back</a>, the formation has been changed, Cazorla class <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/07/santi-cazorla-villarreal-injury-arsenal-interview-sid-lowe\">in the middle</a>, and on Sunday evening they defeated Sevilla 3-0. Neither are safe \u2013 Villarreal are in the relegation zone \u2013 but the emotional boost is huge. \u201cIt\u2019s historic and shows we have soul,\u201d Girona midfielder Alex Granell said, while team-mate Douglas Luiz admitted: \u201cWe needed this.\u201d Villarreal felt the same. \u201cWe needed this to believe that we\u2019re a good team,\u201d said Vicente Iborra. \u201cBut we still haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Celta desperately needed something too, but they didn\u2019t get it. A win of their own against Sevilla a fortnight ago was not the turning point they hoped for. Nor was sacking manager Tony Mohamed: he walked in November, 12 weeks into the season, but there has been no real reaction. In fact, they have been worse under Miguel Cardoso \u2013 from 14 points in 12 to 10 in 12 \u2013 and this weekend\u2019s results mean Celta are Spain\u2019s worse team in 2019. They have three points from 24. Victory over Sevilla was their only win in eight, and they lost the other seven.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/18/thomas-hitzlsperger-makes-swift-impact-at-struggling-stuttgart-bundesliga-football\">Thomas Hitzlsperger makes swift impact at struggling Stuttgart | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Their momentum is only going in one direction and just as importantly the hope that they can reverse that is diminishing. It\u2019s not just that victory over Sevilla was their only win in eight, it\u2019s that it was their only win without Iago Aspas in two years. That\u2019s why supporters saw hope sit down with him on Saturday afternoon and hard it slip even further away with the announcement on Sunday.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good news,\u201d Dr Garc\u00eda Cota said as he appeared before the media. It is the worst news possible. The situation is \u201cGodless\u201d, said El Faro de Vigo \u2013 and their God <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/19/iago-aspas-world-cup-credentials-barcelona-celta-la-liga\">is Aspas</a>. Celta have many problems: they have good players \u2013 Brais M\u00e9ndez and Okay Yokuslu stand out \u2013 but have conceded more than anyone, repeatedly play themselves into trouble, are defensively soft and often chaotic. There have been odd decisions: Pione Sisto has disappeared and this weekend Mathias Jensen played his first minutes under Cardoso. Stanislav Lobotka sat on the bench. M\u00e9ndez went up front. The manager complains that he has never had a full squad available and on Saturday he was without Maxi G\u00f3mez too. And yet sometimes a single player is more significant than all the analyses put together.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a70a2039357d67222082d549f65cae58de7108d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a70a2039357d67222082d549f65cae58de7108d/0_94_3648_2189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iago Aspas in action against Getafe earlier this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iago Aspas in action against Getafe earlier this month.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mariscal/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Missing Aspas and Maxi was, Cardoso claimed, \u201ca brutal assault.\u201d Missing just Aspas is bad enough. \u201cThey went into battle with rifles that fire out confetti, while Levante had weapons of mass destruction,\u201d claimed El Atl\u00e1ntico. Aspas is their top scorer, after all, but it\u2019s more than that. There may be no individual more decisive in La Liga \u2013 perhaps not even Leo Messi.</p> \n<p>Apart from Messi, there is certainly no player upon whom so much responsibility is loaded, in whom so much hope resides, whose absence creates so much anxiety. At Liverpool, he once <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/may/11/iago-aspas-that-corner-is-liverpool-fans-lasting-image-of-me-but-you-cant-live-in-the-past\">took a corner</a>; a youth teamer from across the water in Moa\u00f1a, where his mum wades into the <em>r\u00eda</em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/19/iago-aspas-world-cup-credentials-barcelona-celta-la-liga\">for shellfish</a>, at Celta, he does it all\u2013 an attacker who influences everything everywhere, makes everybody better. He is contagious, tin chest puffed out. He is, as they say, Celta\u2019s <em>faro</em> \u2013 their lighthouse, their guide, their hope. In his absence, there was apathy. Above all, there was fear. A ship adrift, heading for the rocks.</p> \n<p>Aspas tore his calf at Barcelona just before Christmas. Since then, he has played just 24 minutes, still not fully fit when he came on with Celta 2-1 down and a man down against Getafe, watching as an absurd third was gifted. Going into that Barcelona match, they were ninth on 21 points, seven points above the relegation zone; now they are 17, on 24 points, a single point above. They have lost seven of eight, conceding 17. They went into this weekend in free fall, desperately in need of something to grab on to. Him, basically. And while he had admitted that his calf \u201cnever seemed to be quite right\u201d, he was due to play 30 minutes. As he ran, though, something happened: a goal at one end, a tear on the touchline. A new tear, doctors believe, just above the old one.</p> \n<p>\u201cA vigil for Aspas,\u201d one headline said. You half expect them to light a candle outside the physio\u2019s room. No one knows how many weeks it will be before he\u2019s playing, and many fear the answer is the same number of weeks it is before Celta recover, maybe even before they win again. On his debut for Celta, aged 21, Aspas scored the goals that rescued his team from relegation to Spain\u2019s third tier <a href=\"http://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog/espn-fc-united/68/post/2630720/iago-aspas-the-talisman-of-celta-vigo\">and maybe from extinction</a>. Now they need rescuing again, but even he can\u2019t do that if he\u2019s not there.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 There is not league? Just a week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/11/real-madrid-announce-their-return-as-vinicius-junior-bites-back\">after there was</a>, there isn\u2019t again. Santi Solari said Real Madrid were \u201cabsolutely\u201d in the title race but most disagree. \u201cWe needed to win this; these were golden points,\u201d said Thibaut Courtois, just a few minutes after he went up for a last-minute corner to connect with a header he couldn\u2019t quite guide goalwards. They left Vinicius Junior out of the starting XI for the first time in 12 games and suffered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/17/sergio-ramos-real-madrid-girona-match-report\">a deserved defeat</a> \u2013 whose fans were waiting for them with fireworks when they arrived back in Catalonia \u2013 that left them nine points (plus head to head) behind Barcelona and saw them slip back into third.

      "bodyText": "Celta de Vigo\u2019s fans saw hope disappear before their eyes. An hour had gone and Jos\u00e9 Luis Morales had just scored Levante\u2019s third but it wasn\u2019t only what was happening on the pitch that brought the fatalism flooding back at Bala\u00eddos, it was what was happening alongside it. There had been applause and anticipation when Iago Aspas, their captain and their everything, stepped into the sunlight and began warming up, tracksuit off ready to return after six weeks away; now there was silence as he ducked into the shadows and sat down again, worry and resignation written across his face and theirs. Back on the bench, boots off, mission aborted, Aspas watched powerless as the fans clapped Morales and whistled everyone else. He watched team-mates argue over an irrelevant 88th-minute penalty to make it 1-3, the tiniest flicker of life immediately extinguished when Borja Mayoral scored Levante\u2019s fourth seconds later. He listened to supporters call for the president to resign \u2013 which is exactly what Carlos Mouri\u00f1o, pointedly ignoring the mayor up in the directors\u2019 box, would do if he could find someone to pay him enough to buy the club. And he watched another defeat and more disillusion, the final whistle blown to emptying stands. While he watched, he occasionally reached down and rubbed his calf. Celta had been beaten again. Sixteenth in the table, this was bad. Vigo\u2019s press summed it up in apocalyptic terms: Celta were \u201cbleeding\u201d, an \u201copen wound\u201d, a \u201cshipwreck,\u201d \u201cpathetic\u201d, \u201cdepressing\u201d. The fans chanted that they were \u201cup to the bollocks\u201d with it all: sick of it. The team is sick too: \u201cin intensive care\u201d, one headline insisted. And it wasn\u2019t about to get better. After the game, manager Miguel Cardoso admitted he hadn\u2019t put Aspas on because as the forward sprinted along the touchline, he felt something in his calf. The next day, the club doctor revealed another muscle tear. \u201cWe\u2019re a bit scared,\u201d he said. They all are. At the same time as the doctor appeared, Girona were completing a historic victory at the Bernab\u00e9u, beating Real Madrid 2-1 \u2013 \u201cApotheosis!\u201d cheered Diari de Girona \u2013 and within a few hours Villarreal had defeated Sevilla 3-0. Those results saw Celta slip to 17th, a point above the relegation zone and with two teams \u2013 Rayo Vallecano and Villarreal \u2013 within a draw of catching them. Below them are Huesca, who are six points back but have a game in hand and, seemingly long gone six weeks ago, have reacted recently. Without a victory since the opening day, they have now won three of their last six, two of their last three. And Huesca are not the only ones \u2013 which is part of the point, another reason to be fearful in Vigo, where suddenly they\u2019re not safe from anyone. Anything seems possible at the bottom: any three from 10 teams could go down \u2013 Levante in 11th are only seven points off the relegation zone \u2013 in a fight marked by long runs of form, in which a single win can seem to change everything, especially how things feel. Espanyol, within a win of top, then lost nine of 10 matches; Valladolid, quietly impressing everyone at the start, have won only one in nine; Athletic, without a win since the opening day, replaced Eduardo Berizzo with Gaizka Garitano, recovered and have lost just one in nine; Rayo, deep in trouble having won twice in 16 weeks, went on a run of winning four of five, although they have lost that momentum with three defeats in a row. Safety, Celta might have thought, came in other team\u2019s inabilities. But Espanyol have arrested their slide a little, unbeaten in three. More importantly, this weekend Girona and Villarreal finally picked up victories, 11 games later. Girona hadn\u2019t been that bad \u2013 they\u2019re the only side to have picked up points against Barcelona, Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico, winning at the Bernab\u00e9u and drawing at the Camp Nou \u2013 but their results had been and the pressure built. \u201cThis week at last we got our reward,\u201d coach Eusebio Sacrist\u00e1n said. At Villarreal, Javier Calleja is back, the formation has been changed, Cazorla class in the middle, and on Sunday evening they defeated Sevilla 3-0. Neither are safe \u2013 Villarreal are in the relegation zone \u2013 but the emotional boost is huge. \u201cIt\u2019s historic and shows we have soul,\u201d Girona midfielder Alex Granell said, while team-mate Douglas Luiz admitted: \u201cWe needed this.\u201d Villarreal felt the same. \u201cWe needed this to believe that we\u2019re a good team,\u201d said Vicente Iborra. \u201cBut we still haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d Celta desperately needed something too, but they didn\u2019t get it. A win of their own against Sevilla a fortnight ago was not the turning point they hoped for. Nor was sacking manager Tony Mohamed: he walked in November, 12 weeks into the season, but there has been no real reaction. In fact, they have been worse under Miguel Cardoso \u2013 from 14 points in 12 to 10 in 12 \u2013 and this weekend\u2019s results mean Celta are Spain\u2019s worse team in 2019. They have three points from 24. Victory over Sevilla was their only win in eight, and they lost the other seven. Their momentum is only going in one direction and just as importantly the hope that they can reverse that is diminishing. It\u2019s not just that victory over Sevilla was their only win in eight, it\u2019s that it was their only win without Iago Aspas in two years. That\u2019s why supporters saw hope sit down with him on Saturday afternoon and hard it slip even further away with the announcement on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s not good news,\u201d Dr Garc\u00eda Cota said as he appeared before the media. It is the worst news possible. The situation is \u201cGodless\u201d, said El Faro de Vigo \u2013 and their God is Aspas. Celta have many problems: they have good players \u2013 Brais M\u00e9ndez and Okay Yokuslu stand out \u2013 but have conceded more than anyone, repeatedly play themselves into trouble, are defensively soft and often chaotic. There have been odd decisions: Pione Sisto has disappeared and this weekend Mathias Jensen played his first minutes under Cardoso. Stanislav Lobotka sat on the bench. M\u00e9ndez went up front. The manager complains that he has never had a full squad available and on Saturday he was without Maxi G\u00f3mez too. And yet sometimes a single player is more significant than all the analyses put together. Missing Aspas and Maxi was, Cardoso claimed, \u201ca brutal assault.\u201d Missing just Aspas is bad enough. \u201cThey went into battle with rifles that fire out confetti, while Levante had weapons of mass destruction,\u201d claimed El Atl\u00e1ntico. Aspas is their top scorer, after all, but it\u2019s more than that. There may be no individual more decisive in La Liga \u2013 perhaps not even Leo Messi. Apart from Messi, there is certainly no player upon whom so much responsibility is loaded, in whom so much hope resides, whose absence creates so much anxiety. At Liverpool, he once took a corner; a youth teamer from across the water in Moa\u00f1a, where his mum wades into the r\u00edafor shellfish, at Celta, he does it all\u2013 an attacker who influences everything everywhere, makes everybody better. He is contagious, tin chest puffed out. He is, as they say, Celta\u2019s faro \u2013 their lighthouse, their guide, their hope. In his absence, there was apathy. Above all, there was fear. A ship adrift, heading for the rocks. Aspas tore his calf at Barcelona just before Christmas. Since then, he has played just 24 minutes, still not fully fit when he came on with Celta 2-1 down and a man down against Getafe, watching as an absurd third was gifted. Going into that Barcelona match, they were ninth on 21 points, seven points above the relegation zone; now they are 17, on 24 points, a single point above. They have lost seven of eight, conceding 17. They went into this weekend in free fall, desperately in need of something to grab on to. Him, basically. And while he had admitted that his calf \u201cnever seemed to be quite right\u201d, he was due to play 30 minutes. As he ran, though, something happened: a goal at one end, a tear on the touchline. A new tear, doctors believe, just above the old one. \u201cA vigil for Aspas,\u201d one headline said. You half expect them to light a candle outside the physio\u2019s room. No one knows how many weeks it will be before he\u2019s playing, and many fear the answer is the same number of weeks it is before Celta recover, maybe even before they win again. On his debut for Celta, aged 21, Aspas scored the goals that rescued his team from relegation to Spain\u2019s third tier and maybe from extinction. Now they need rescuing again, but even he can\u2019t do that if he\u2019s not there. Talking points \u2022 There is not league? Just a week after there was, there isn\u2019t again. Santi Solari said Real Madrid were \u201cabsolutely\u201d in the title race but most disagree. \u201cWe needed to win this; these were golden points,\u201d said Thibaut Courtois, just a few minutes after he went up for a last-minute corner to connect with a header he couldn\u2019t quite guide goalwards. They left Vinicius Junior out of the starting XI for the first time in 12 games and suffered a deserved defeat \u2013 whose fans were waiting for them with fireworks when they arrived back in Catalonia \u2013 that left them nine points (plus head to head) behind Barcelona and saw them slip back into third. They\u2019ve lost seven times already this season \u2013 their worst total in a decade. \u2022 There\u2019s certainly no league for Sevilla, who look increasingly like what they are: a team who have played 44 games already this season. \u2022 Not only did Villarreal win this weekend, they also scored arguably the goal of the season. A wonderful move culminated in Carlos Bacca\u2019s backheel that left goalkeeper and defender crashing into each other and Toto Ekambi free to get the second. Gorgeous. Although he did almost miss. He looked suitably sheepish too.",

(That JFK book is called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/27/the-best-books-about-the-jfk-assassination-from-norman-mailer-to-don-delillo\">Libra</a>.)</p> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16742616\">RobertHowardNG9 </a>has been rereading Birthday by Alan Sillitoe and \u201cloving it as much as the first time\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Like Stoner by John Williams it is one those rare books I actually feel a participant in, rather than observer. Chapter 8 with Arthur Seaton in conversation with his wife Avril makes me wonder how Sillitoe overheard me and my wife?</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>Spurred by the sad death of Albert Finney\u201d, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10079055\">beckythatcher </a>has also been reading Sillitoe \u2013 this time Saturday Night and Sunday Morning:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s a forgotten masterpiece. The characters all ring true. The description of factory work and pub nights is as good as (better than) a documentary. The post-war boom in earnings and full employment gave working people plenty of spare cash, and the family scenes are marvellous. Adultery, abortion, street fights and nosy neighbours - it\u2019s all there. There\u2019s a little, regrettable, sub-DH Lawrence stuff about countryside, but that\u2019s more than forgivable.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17554763\">BristolHatter </a>has been enjoying The Dawn Watch by Maya Jasonoff:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have read a number of books about Joseph Conrad over the years but this is shaping up to be one of the best so far. It is basically a biography with a concentration on the relevance of four of his novels to the experience of modern day life. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in Conrad and his work.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/18298856\">LLCoolJ_ </a>recommends Late In The Day by Tessa Hadley:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s the third of hers I\u2019ve read, and she has yet to disappoint. I\u2019ll take these words from NYT review:</p> <p>Hadley is adept at fluid omniscience, at storytelling that skims through the years as easily as it weaves through various points of view...</p> <p>...and add that she is also adept at developing fully-realized characters, male and female, young and middle-aged. I almost forgot that I was reading about fictional characters. I liked it very much</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13472965\">SydneyH </a>declares that Men at Arms, the first of Evelyn Waugh\u2019s Sword of Honour series, \u201cis a charming book\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Guy Crouchback, a middle-class, divorced misfit, signs up with the Halberdiers regiment in the second world war. To the admiration of his peers, he grows a thick moustache, curls it with a hot iron, and procures a monocle for shooting. Waugh introduces a few brilliant characters, notably Crouchback\u2019s fellow soldier, Apthorpe, but also his Cyclopean Brigadier Ritchie-Hook, and his man-hopping ex-wife. Much of the humour comes from the fiasco of administrating a rapidly-changing war campaign, with eccentric officers \u2013 some of whom are promoted just to be gotten rid of \u2013 complicating matters.</p> </blockquote> <p>Those who have read Sword Of Honour will also know about the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books-paperbacks-the-possessor-of-the-thunderbox-1093957.html\">thunderbox</a>\u201d, and its responsibility for what must be one of the greatest moments in literary history\u2026 But to say more would ruin a wonderful surprise. Suffice to say, Evelyn Waugh was a genius.</p> <h2><strong>Interesting links about books and reading</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.mhpbooks.com/no-matter-what-amazon-does-there-are-consequences-proposed-queens-hq-is-canceled/\">What has Amazon cost the US economy</a>?

Chapter 8 with Arthur Seaton in conversation with his wife Avril makes me wonder how Sillitoe overheard me and my wife? \u201cSpurred by the sad death of Albert Finney\u201d, beckythatcher has also been reading Sillitoe \u2013 this time Saturday Night and Sunday Morning: It\u2019s a forgotten masterpiece. The characters all ring true. The description of factory work and pub nights is as good as (better than) a documentary. The post-war boom in earnings and full employment gave working people plenty of spare cash, and the family scenes are marvellous. Adultery, abortion, street fights and nosy neighbours - it\u2019s all there. There\u2019s a little, regrettable, sub-DH Lawrence stuff about countryside, but that\u2019s more than forgivable. BristolHatter has been enjoying The Dawn Watch by Maya Jasonoff: I have read a number of books about Joseph Conrad over the years but this is shaping up to be one of the best so far. It is basically a biography with a concentration on the relevance of four of his novels to the experience of modern day life. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in Conrad and his work. LLCoolJ_ recommends Late In The Day by Tessa Hadley: It\u2019s the third of hers I\u2019ve read, and she has yet to disappoint. I\u2019ll take these words from NYT review: Hadley is adept at fluid omniscience, at storytelling that skims through the years as easily as it weaves through various points of view... ...and add that she is also adept at developing fully-realized characters, male and female, young and middle-aged. I almost forgot that I was reading about fictional characters. I liked it very much Finally, SydneyH declares that Men at Arms, the first of Evelyn Waugh\u2019s Sword of Honour series, \u201cis a charming book\u201d: Guy Crouchback, a middle-class, divorced misfit, signs up with the Halberdiers regiment in the second world war. To the admiration of his peers, he grows a thick moustache, curls it with a hot iron, and procures a monocle for shooting. Waugh introduces a few brilliant characters, notably Crouchback\u2019s fellow soldier, Apthorpe, but also his Cyclopean Brigadier Ritchie-Hook, and his man-hopping ex-wife. Much of the humour comes from the fiasco of administrating a rapidly-changing war campaign, with eccentric officers \u2013 some of whom are promoted just to be gotten rid of \u2013 complicating matters. Those who have read Sword Of Honour will also know about the \u201cthunderbox\u201d, and its responsibility for what must be one of the greatest moments in literary history\u2026 But to say more would ruin a wonderful surprise. Suffice to say, Evelyn Waugh was a genius. Interesting links about books and reading What has Amazon cost the US economy? (Answer: a lot \u2013 full study here.) Dolly Parton brings free books to Ireland. Why do so many book covers still use the phrase \u201ca novel\u201d for works of fiction? \u201cSouls are also what (or who) you write with, what (or who) you write about and what (or who) you write for.\u201d Toby Litt gets soulful. The length of Victorian novel titles rapidly declined in the 1860s. (Hat tip to MachenBach.)

      "body": "<p>A debate about the gender identity of Dr James Barry, the pioneering Victorian who adopted a male persona to become the UK\u2019s first female-born doctor, has erupted after the award-winning author EJ Levy was accused of disrespecting Barry\u2019s legacy by using female pronouns in a forthcoming novel.</p> <p>Levy announced last week that she had sold a novel about the \u201ctrue story\u201d of Barry, titled The Cape Doctor. The forthcoming book, which will be released by Little, Brown, will trace Barry\u2019s life story: born Margaret Ann Bulkley in Ireland, the future doctor became Barry at the age of 20 and left for Edinburgh to study medicine as a man. Barry joined the army after graduation, the start of a distinguished career as a military surgeon that spanned Cape Town, St Helena and Trinidad and Tobago. In 1865, Barry returned to the UK with dysentery, and died. A maid discovered the doctor\u2019s biological gender after the death.</p> <p>When Levy, winner of the Flannery O\u2019Connor award, announced the news of her novel by describing Barry as \u201ca heroine for our time, for all time\u201d, other authors began to question Levy\u2019s reference to Barry as \u201cshe\u201d, including novelist Celeste Ng, who told Levy: \u201cI\u2019m now seeing you use she/her pronouns for Barry even as many are telling you Barry himself used and wanted he/him pronouns. I hope you and L,B will listen to these concerns and take them into account.\u201d</p> <p>Transgender performance poet Jay Hulme called Levy\u2019s position \u201cabhorrent\u201d, while writer Alexandra Erin tweeted: \u201cHe categorised himself as a man, lived as a man, died as a man, and would have preferred to be buried as a man. There\u2019s no room for interpretation.\u201d</p> <p>Levy, who identifies as queer, defended her use of female pronouns in the novel. \u201cIn death, as in life, Dr Barry engenders controversy, but one thing is clear: she refused facile gender categories. So do I, in my novel,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cI work from historical facts, as do Barry\u2019s biographers, who identify her as she \u2026 I\u2019ve read and researched for years. To insist Barry is trans distorts complex history \u2026 There\u2019s no evidence Barry considered herself trans; she dressed as [a] man as needed to be [a] soldier, doctor \u2026 Shifting readings of her body are what my novel wrestles with; it\u2019s been taken into account; I use she/her as her biographers do.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s evidence that Barry missed being a woman. But we also know that he relished being a man</p> <footer> <cite>Jeremy Dronfield</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Barry\u2019s gender identity has been overwhelmingly framed as female by writers over the past 150 years, said Cardiff University professor Ann Heilmann, author of <a href=\"https://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9783319713854\">Neo-/Victorian Biographilia and James Miranda Barry: A Study in Transgender and Transgenre</a>, exceptions being Patricia Duncker\u2019s 1999 novel James Miranda Barry and Rachel Holmes\u2019s 2002 biography The Secret Life of Dr James Barry.</p> <p>Heilmann said she believed Barry \u201cfelt\u201d male, adding: \u201cBut whether he had always \u2018felt male\u2019 during his earlier female years (he changed identity at age 20), who knows? \u2026 Much of what we \u2018know\u2019 about him is really the Barry myth \u2013 that is, culturally constructed legend, based on hearsay, fiction and fiction-inflected biography.\u201d</p> <p>The Cardiff academic said that while it was possible that Barry\u2019s initial decision to assume a male identity was driven by a wish for an independent life and career in medicine, her impression was that \u201che then \u2018became\u2019 male in terms of his inner (and not only outer) \u2026 identity. That would still make him trans in today\u2019s terms, and I approached the real-life character as a trans person\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhile I understand that emotions run very high (understandably so, given the difficulties trans people face and in light of ongoing tensions between feminism and the trans community), I don\u2019t think that Barry can be that easily mapped on to contemporary trans thought,\u201d she said. \u201cThough of course there have always been trans people, the lived and felt gender identity of an 18th and early 19th-century person would have been very different from our contemporary identity politics.\u201d</p> <p>Holmes said that using female pronouns for Barry was \u201creally quite disrespectful\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAs a young feminist when I set out to write this book, which was based on PhD research, I thought I was writing a story of a woman who cross-dressed in search of fame and fortune because she couldn\u2019t become a doctor wearing skirts. I was struck very quickly when I started doing research that this wasn\u2019t the case at all,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Holmes\u2019s biography identifies Barry as having androgen insensitivity syndrome, which the NHS defines as describing a child who is genetically male, but whose genitals appear female or somewhere between male and female.</p> <p>\u201cIt is perfectly clear that Barry had ASS and effectively would now be a trans person. He didn\u2019t have the language or the science, but he was looking for it,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cThis is someone who fought his whole life for that identity, and understood himself to be betwixt and between.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jul/25/secret-transgender-victorian-surgeon-feted-by-heritage-england\">Secret transgender Victorian surgeon feted by Historic England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jeremy Dronfield, co-author of Dr James Barry: A Woman Ahead of Her Time, said: \u201cIn my biography, I used male pronouns for Barry. He was, at least outwardly, a man. But whether Barry qualifies as transgender in modern terms is complicated. When Margaret became James, it wasn\u2019t primarily because she wanted to be a man. She wanted to live the kind of life which in 1809 was impossible for a woman. Once the persona had served its purpose, Margaret intended to discard it. Circumstances prevented that. There\u2019s evidence that Barry missed being a woman. But we also know that he relished being a man, his behaviour exceeding what was necessary for disguise. However, the claim made online that Barry left a will asking to be remembered as a man is false. He left no statement of identity.</p> <p>\u201cIf Margaret had been born in 1989 instead of 1789, free to be a surgeon and soldier, would she have chosen to become a man? On balance, I don\u2019t think so, but Margaret might have identified as non-binary. I have no argument with seeing James Barry as a transgender icon, or Margaret as a feminist role model. I do take issue with those who insist on recognising one and erasing the other.\u201d</p>",

When Levy, winner of the Flannery O\u2019Connor award, announced the news of her novel by describing Barry as \u201ca heroine for our time, for all time\u201d, other authors began to question Levy\u2019s reference to Barry as \u201cshe\u201d, including novelist Celeste Ng, who told Levy: \u201cI\u2019m now seeing you use she/her pronouns for Barry even as many are telling you Barry himself used and wanted he/him pronouns. I hope you and L,B will listen to these concerns and take them into account.\u201d Transgender performance poet Jay Hulme called Levy\u2019s position \u201cabhorrent\u201d, while writer Alexandra Erin tweeted: \u201cHe categorised himself as a man, lived as a man, died as a man, and would have preferred to be buried as a man. There\u2019s no room for interpretation.\u201d Levy, who identifies as queer, defended her use of female pronouns in the novel. \u201cIn death, as in life, Dr Barry engenders controversy, but one thing is clear: she refused facile gender categories. So do I, in my novel,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cI work from historical facts, as do Barry\u2019s biographers, who identify her as she \u2026 I\u2019ve read and researched for years. To insist Barry is trans distorts complex history \u2026 There\u2019s no evidence Barry considered herself trans; she dressed as [a] man as needed to be [a] soldier, doctor \u2026 Shifting readings of her body are what my novel wrestles with; it\u2019s been taken into account; I use she/her as her biographers do.\u201d Barry\u2019s gender identity has been overwhelmingly framed as female by writers over the past 150 years, said Cardiff University professor Ann Heilmann, author of Neo-/Victorian Biographilia and James Miranda Barry: A Study in Transgender and Transgenre, exceptions being Patricia Duncker\u2019s 1999 novel James Miranda Barry and Rachel Holmes\u2019s 2002 biography The Secret Life of Dr James Barry. Heilmann said she believed Barry \u201cfelt\u201d male, adding: \u201cBut whether he had always \u2018felt male\u2019 during his earlier female years (he changed identity at age 20), who knows? \u2026 Much of what we \u2018know\u2019 about him is really the Barry myth \u2013 that is, culturally constructed legend, based on hearsay, fiction and fiction-inflected biography.\u201d The Cardiff academic said that while it was possible that Barry\u2019s initial decision to assume a male identity was driven by a wish for an independent life and career in medicine, her impression was that \u201che then \u2018became\u2019 male in terms of his inner (and not only outer) \u2026 identity. That would still make him trans in today\u2019s terms, and I approached the real-life character as a trans person\u201d. \u201cWhile I understand that emotions run very high (understandably so, given the difficulties trans people face and in light of ongoing tensions between feminism and the trans community), I don\u2019t think that Barry can be that easily mapped on to contemporary trans thought,\u201d she said. \u201cThough of course there have always been trans people, the lived and felt gender identity of an 18th and early 19th-century person would have been very different from our contemporary identity politics.\u201d Holmes said that using female pronouns for Barry was \u201creally quite disrespectful\u201d. \u201cAs a young feminist when I set out to write this book, which was based on PhD research, I thought I was writing a story of a woman who cross-dressed in search of fame and fortune because she couldn\u2019t become a doctor wearing skirts. I was struck very quickly when I started doing research that this wasn\u2019t the case at all,\u201d she said. Holmes\u2019s biography identifies Barry as having androgen insensitivity syndrome, which the NHS defines as describing a child who is genetically male, but whose genitals appear female or somewhere between male and female. \u201cIt is perfectly clear that Barry had ASS and effectively would now be a trans person. He didn\u2019t have the language or the science, but he was looking for it,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cThis is someone who fought his whole life for that identity, and understood himself to be betwixt and between.\u201d Jeremy Dronfield, co-author of Dr James Barry: A Woman Ahead of Her Time, said: \u201cIn my biography, I used male pronouns for Barry. He was, at least outwardly, a man. But whether Barry qualifies as transgender in modern terms is complicated. When Margaret became James, it wasn\u2019t primarily because she wanted to be a man. She wanted to live the kind of life which in 1809 was impossible for a woman. Once the persona had served its purpose, Margaret intended to discard it. Circumstances prevented that. There\u2019s evidence that Barry missed being a woman. But we also know that he relished being a man, his behaviour exceeding what was necessary for disguise. However, the claim made online that Barry left a will asking to be remembered as a man is false. He left no statement of identity. \u201cIf Margaret had been born in 1989 instead of 1789, free to be a surgeon and soldier, would she have chosen to become a man? On balance, I don\u2019t think so, but Margaret might have identified as non-binary. I have no argument with seeing James Barry as a transgender icon, or Margaret as a feminist role model. I do take issue with those who insist on recognising one and erasing the other.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "What a time to be alive for Conservative former chief whip-turned-defence secretary Gavin Williamson. Keen to turn back the clock to the days when Britain\u2019s men in uniform could brutally quash a native uprising in the morning, appropriate half of India\u2019s wealth in the afternoon and enjoy a G&amp;T or seven in the evening, the man who once kept a pet tarantula in his office to cultivate an air of ruthless cunning has appropriated an image befitting his new role: action man. Having said, in the wake of the Skripal poisoning in Salisbury, that \u201cfrankly Russia should go away and shut up\u201d, Williamson was last week talking about how Brexit gave Britain an opportunity to \u201cenhance our lethality\u201d in response to grave threats posed by Russia and China. Part of this \u201cenhanced lethality\u201d was an announcement that Britain would send a Royal Navy aircraft carrier into China\u2019s backyard. This \u201cidiotic speech\u201d led to him being accused of \u201cgunboat diplomacy\u201d, and was thought to be the reason China then decided to cancel a visit from the chancellor, Philip Hammond. But our all-action minister was undeterred, ripping off his Clark Kent suit to reveal, once again, the full camo of Britain\u2019s best and bravest. Photos released this morning show a grimacing Williamson emerging from icy Norwegian waters, where he joined marines for an Arctic dip. Afterwards, the defence secretary took a little rum and toasted the Queen, according to a reporter present. All of which makes you wonder what Williamson will come up with next. Britain is in the midst of a full-blown identity crisis, and Conservative politicians are especially ready and willing to retreat into the kind of imperial fantasies that even children in the 1950s thought were a little pass\u00e9. Confirmation from the Ministry of Defence was not forthcoming, but it\u2019s easy to imagine big bad Gav has a few more stunts up his sleeve. There he is, commandeering a 19th-century frigate, packing it up with the collected works of Patrick O\u2019Brien and setting course for the strait of Gibraltar to take on the Spanish navy. Here he is, going rogue at an MoD paintball away day, putting some of his marine experience to good use and choking a middle-ranking civil servant into submission to win the day for Team Big Will. Next, taking inspiration from bare-chested salmon slayer Vladimir Putin, GW sets out for the freezing waters of Siberia, a harpoon in his hand and a team from a bespoke branded content agency hired by the MoD at his side. Picture him now \u2013 as he will be, in three months time, as parliament prepares to vote yet again on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal \u2013 astride the deck of a repurposed HMS Conqueror, preparing to re-invade the Falkland Islands. From the southern Atlantic our hero, dressed as Kenneth Branagh in Dunkirk, heads to Australia, where he demands that prime minister Scott Morrison iron his collection of Union Jacks, before discussing the transfer of 50,000 detainees from the UK\u2019s overcrowded prisons to Norfolk Island. Back home, our handsome hero is securing government funding for a new series of Sharpe, in which he replaces Sean Bean in the title role. In the meantime, he\u2019s coming to work in a red guardsman\u2019s jacket and getting his sword out in the middle of meetings. A photo shoot in an adventure playground takes an unfortunate turn when our Gavin, keen to show his prowess, falls off the monkey bars and bangs his knee. TV cameras catch his yelps of pain and the BBC buries the footage in the interests of the nation.

Invoking the spirit of Agincourt and Poitiers, the defence secretary announces that the MoD\u2019s cross-channel GoFundMe will finance new cavalry and longbow units to rain down 14th-century fire on any Frog that gets in Britain\u2019s way. In the House of Commons, General Williamson (an honorific title he has bestowed upon himself) calls for John McDonnell to be strapped into a catapult outside the Houses of Parliament and flung into the Thames for daring to question the legacy of Winston Churchill. Winston Williamson, in a homburg hat and chewing on a cigar, offers to operate the catapult himself.

      "body": "<p>Three years after being released from an Iranian prison, Jason Rezaian can still not quite shake off a recurring bad dream. It no longer dogs him several times a week as it did in the early days after his release, but it still revisits him, often after he has been retelling his tale. And it never changes.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a nightmare of somebody beating me and trying to chase me down,\u201d says Rezaian, a Washington Post journalist now back in his newspaper\u2019s home town. \u201cIt is: you were supposed to get out and you didn\u2019t. There was this moment you were supposed to be released and for whatever reason, that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <p>The dream takes him back to being held in Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin prison, where his earnest interrogator, Kazem, is telling him that he is still in his cell because he has failed to say or do exactly what was required of him by the state; now the moment has drifted from the miserable inmate\u2019s grasp.</p> <p>The dreams are the residue from the techniques of Rezaian\u2019s jailers, the intelligence arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and proof that they were at least partly effective. Throughout most of his 544 days in prison \u2013 his solitary confinement, his absurd trial \u2013 the interrogators worked to instil a sense of dread, uncertainty and culpability in the inmate\u2019s mind.</p> <p>For the first few months after plainclothes secret police grabbed Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi \u2013 an Iranian reporter for Bloomberg News \u2013 from their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/25/iran-washington-post-tehran-reporter-jason-rezaian-journalists-arrrested\" title=\"\">Tehran home in July 2014</a>, he was repeatedly threatened with execution. Sometimes, he was told he would be beheaded as a traitor \u2013 but Rezaian was pretty sure that if he were to be killed, he would be hanged.</p> <p>It was far from an idle threat. Iran is one of the world\u2019s most prolific executioners (along with China and the US). Not long after Rezaian\u2019s arrest, the Islamic Republic went on what Amnesty International described as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/07/irans-staggering-execution-spree/\" title=\"\">staggering execution spree</a>\u201d, killing nearly 700 people in the first half of 2015 alone \u2013 mostly drug-related offenders, who were hanged. Rezaian would see the doomed suspects on his days going to and from the court. They were killed in Evin\u2019s execution square, close to his cell.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"547fe9c60bd1fe7bcf8d613143a2eb2b8bfe4732\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/547fe9c60bd1fe7bcf8d613143a2eb2b8bfe4732/0_157_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters during Rezaian\u2019s imprisonment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters during Rezaian\u2019s imprisonment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Burton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFor the first six or seven months, [the threat] was pretty regular,\u201d recalls Rezaian. \u201cIt was the constant anxiety of: \u2018Are they going to kill me, are they going to keep me for ever or am I going to be released tomorrow?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what to believe. That\u2019s the method. That\u2019s the torture. People say: \u2018Well, you weren\u2019t beaten.\u2019 I say they never laid a finger on me, but I was certainly tortured, and they have to pay for that.\u201d</p> <p>Rezaian, now 42, is suing the Iranian government for his treatment, and he is now telling his story in a memoir, Prisoner, an account of his 18 months in a cell, the capricious motives behind the arrest, the bizarre espionage charges and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/12/jason-rezaian-convicted-iran-trial-washington-post\" title=\"\">sham trial</a>. Interwoven are recollections of his Iranian-American upbringing in California, and his decision to leave the carpet business there to try his luck as a reporter in his other homeland, Iran.</p> <p>Rezaian\u2019s and Salehi\u2019s dreams of a life lived between the US and Iran fell victim to infighting within the Iranian system.</p> <p>Since being elected to the presidency in June 2013, Hassan Rouhani has led relative pragmatists in an attempt to break out of international isolation. By the time of the arrests, negotiations over the fate of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme were in full swing. Rezaian was in Vienna to cover the talks shortly before he was detained. He believes he and his wife were collateral damage from an attempt to sabotage those talks by hardliners in the IRGC and beyond.</p> <p>The couple were among many victims of the constant, vicious churn that is Iranian politics. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe\" title=\"\">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe</a>, a British-Iranian project manager for the Thomson Reuters Foundation charity, has now been in jail since April 2016, separated from her young daughter and her husband.</p> <p>\u201cHer continued detention, now nearly twice as long as mine, and the way in which this innocent and young family have been separated is criminal,\u201d says Rezaian. \u201cUnfortunately, Iran has a 40-year-long record of doing this. She will come home \u2026 but this should have never happened, and I\u2019m disgusted anew every time I think about it.\u201d</p> <p>The UK\u2019s foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has accused the Iranian government of using Zaghari-Ratcliffe as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/28/hunt-iran-imprisoned-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-diplomatic-reasons\" title=\"\">pawn of diplomatic leverage</a>\u201d. Rezaian bristles at the term being applied to him.</p> <p>\u201cI push back on the term \u2018pawn\u2019 because I think I was a little more valuable than that,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about chess, but at least call me the horse!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45d02f454cc2aeca5ec5df0b056308bbf94b7f82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45d02f454cc2aeca5ec5df0b056308bbf94b7f82/0_0_3000_2309/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rezaian\u2019s book documenting his frightening, and at times farcical, experience.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"770\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rezaian\u2019s book documenting his frightening, and at times farcical, experience.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Wilson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He also resists the depiction of Iranian infighting as a good-v-evil struggle, pointing to shades of grey among Iran\u2019s moderates. Rezaian sees the IRGC faction as wanting to turn Iran into a much more absolutist regime, resembling North Korea, while the Rouhani circle would rather have something more like China, opening up to the world, but keeping the essence of the regime intact. \u201cThey want to have their cake and eat it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He is not going to forget that the country\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif \u2013 urbane, fluent English-speaking and seen by many as a moderate in the regime \u2013 repeated espionage allegations against Rezaian in public and private as a means of justifying his continued detention during the nuclear talks.</p> <p>His jailers finally gave up their efforts to force him to confess to espionage, and his high profile as the Washington Post\u2019s Tehran correspondent meant they did not attempt physical torture, or fabricate evidence.</p> <p>In the absence of hard evidence, the prosecutors resorted to presenting the truth in a sinister light. The charges described more or less what Rezaian had set out to do with his journalism \u2013 humanise Iran and Iranians for an American audience. In the eyes of the court, this was his crime. His many articles about food and pastimes (his last report from Iran was about baseball enthusiasts) were no more than insidious efforts to sap Iran\u2019s revolutionary will and break down the walls protecting the purity of the Islamic Republic.</p> <p>Viewed from the outside, the secret court proceedings and blatantly spurious charges were farcical. Seen from inside a solitary confinement cell, by the light of lightbulbs that were never switched off, it was all ceaselessly cruel \u2013 and it has left its mark on Rezaian.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s going to stick with me for a very long time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt sounds trite, but my trust in the world has been shaken. Like many foreign correspondents, I used to be pretty intrepid in where I was willing to go. Now I\u2019m not. I have to have very concrete plans. I get anxious and paranoid if I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to get back to my hotel. All these things are so counter to the way that lived for so many years \u2026 I don\u2019t do well in crowds. And I don\u2019t do well in artificial lighting because I experienced it 24/7.\u201d</p> <p>Those fears have only grown deeper and darker since the murder of his Washington Post colleague Jamal Khashoggi in October last year. Just a few months earlier, they had been discussing their common experience of exile, and their contrasting impressions of each other\u2019s countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran \u2013 bitter rivals always ready to outdo each other in cruelty.</p> <p>\u201cWe were kindred spirits, in the sense that we both felt forced out of place \u2013 that these governments didn\u2019t want to see us in their midst any longer,\u201d Rezaian says of those conversations. \u201cHis murder had very immediate effects on me and my wife, psychologically.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Iranian people have seen through authoritarianism. They want to be integrated into the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He followed Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, and the gruesome details of his killing and dismemberment from the Washington Post newsroom. He describes it as an eerie experience, knowing that his similar emergency could have ended just as darkly.</p> <p>\u201cAs vicious as they were in the way they talked to me, they were also human and made mistakes and there were some kindnesses,\u201d he says of his persecutors. \u201cThey very much believed they were doing God\u2019s work, and there was an element of trying to get you on their side: \u2018If you just follow our light you\u2019ll be safe.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Unexpectedly, Rezaian\u2019s book is scattered with moments of comedy. Kazem, his interrogator, at one point forces him to call his mother, presumably in the belief that longing to see her would undermine the journalist\u2019s resolve. But the ploy backfires when Rezaian hands the phone to his jailor, saying his furious mother would like a word, forcing the hapless Kazem into tongue-tied retreat.</p> <p>After they gave up trying to get their captive to confess to being a spy, his interrogators spent much of their time with him debating politics and philosophy. Rezaian found himself looking forward to the interrogation sessions as a break from the monotony of incarceration.</p> <p>A deal for his release was finally reached between the Obama and Rouhani administrations in January 2016, involving a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/iran-releases-washington-post-journalist-jason-rezaian\" title=\"\">prisoner swap</a>. Seven Iranians, six of them US dual nationals, were given clemency from sanctions-busting charges, while Rezaian was set free with two other dual-nationality prisoners and allowed to fly to the US with Yeganeh.</p> <p>The 2016 US presidential primaries were about to get under way, and in the last minutes as they waited for Rezaian\u2019s transport home to be arranged, his interrogators had a final question for him.</p> <p>\u201cWhile we still have you, explain to us about this electoral college,\u201d one of them demanded. \u201cIt makes no sense to us.\u201d</p> <p>Rezaian assured them they were not alone. Ten months later, it was the US electoral college system that assured Trump\u2019s election, despite Hillary Clinton winning the popular vote.</p> <p>Even before the primaries, Rezaian\u2019s Iranian captors predicted Donald Trump would become president, provoking a snort of derision from the returning American.</p> <p>\u201cYou guys are even dumber than I thought,\u201d he told them.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very simple,\u201d one of them replied. \u201cTrump is the candidate that hates Muslims most.\u201d</p> <p>Since his release, Rezaian has witnessed the Iranian\u2019s prediction come true and has seen Trump repudiate the nuclear deal it took so many years to negotiate, and which indirectly cost him his freedom.</p> <p>Talk of regime change is once again making the rounds of Washington\u2019s rightwing thinktanks, where Rezaian is sometimes invited to speak, on the mistaken assumption that his experience would have made him an enthusiastic cheerleader for Trump\u2019s campaign of maximum pressure.</p> <p>\u201cYou can hate the regime in Iran, and be opposed to the Trump administration\u2019s policies \u2013 in my experience, the majority of Iranian people feel that way,\u201d he argues. \u201cUnfortunately there is this zero-sum narrative in the US right now that these guys have to be ground down by whatever means necessary, and the Iranian people are going to thanks us later. I think that\u2019s disingenuous at best.\u201d</p> <p>Maximum pressure, the strangling of the Iranian economy, is only putting off real democratic change, Rezaian insists. It is a task best left to Iranians.</p> <p>\u201cThe Iranian people have seen through theocracy and have seen through authoritarianism. They want to be integrated into the world,\u201d he says. \u201cThey will have their day of reckoning. But we are not there yet.\u201d</p> <p><em>Prisoner \u2013 My 544 Days in an Iranian Prison by Jason Rezaian is published by HarperCollins</em><em>.</em></p>",

There was this moment you were supposed to be released and for whatever reason, that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d The dream takes him back to being held in Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin prison, where his earnest interrogator, Kazem, is telling him that he is still in his cell because he has failed to say or do exactly what was required of him by the state; now the moment has drifted from the miserable inmate\u2019s grasp. The dreams are the residue from the techniques of Rezaian\u2019s jailers, the intelligence arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and proof that they were at least partly effective. Throughout most of his 544 days in prison \u2013 his solitary confinement, his absurd trial \u2013 the interrogators worked to instil a sense of dread, uncertainty and culpability in the inmate\u2019s mind. For the first few months after plainclothes secret police grabbed Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi \u2013 an Iranian reporter for Bloomberg News \u2013 from their Tehran home in July 2014, he was repeatedly threatened with execution. Sometimes, he was told he would be beheaded as a traitor \u2013 but Rezaian was pretty sure that if he were to be killed, he would be hanged. It was far from an idle threat. Iran is one of the world\u2019s most prolific executioners (along with China and the US). Not long after Rezaian\u2019s arrest, the Islamic Republic went on what Amnesty International described as a \u201cstaggering execution spree\u201d, killing nearly 700 people in the first half of 2015 alone \u2013 mostly drug-related offenders, who were hanged. Rezaian would see the doomed suspects on his days going to and from the court. They were killed in Evin\u2019s execution square, close to his cell. \u201cFor the first six or seven months, [the threat] was pretty regular,\u201d recalls Rezaian. \u201cIt was the constant anxiety of: \u2018Are they going to kill me, are they going to keep me for ever or am I going to be released tomorrow?\u2019 \u201cYou don\u2019t know what to believe. That\u2019s the method. That\u2019s the torture. People say: \u2018Well, you weren\u2019t beaten.\u2019 I say they never laid a finger on me, but I was certainly tortured, and they have to pay for that.\u201d Rezaian, now 42, is suing the Iranian government for his treatment, and he is now telling his story in a memoir, Prisoner, an account of his 18 months in a cell, the capricious motives behind the arrest, the bizarre espionage charges and the sham trial. Interwoven are recollections of his Iranian-American upbringing in California, and his decision to leave the carpet business there to try his luck as a reporter in his other homeland, Iran. Rezaian\u2019s and Salehi\u2019s dreams of a life lived between the US and Iran fell victim to infighting within the Iranian system. Since being elected to the presidency in June 2013, Hassan Rouhani has led relative pragmatists in an attempt to break out of international isolation. By the time of the arrests, negotiations over the fate of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme were in full swing. Rezaian was in Vienna to cover the talks shortly before he was detained. He believes he and his wife were collateral damage from an attempt to sabotage those talks by hardliners in the IRGC and beyond. The couple were among many victims of the constant, vicious churn that is Iranian politics. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian project manager for the Thomson Reuters Foundation charity, has now been in jail since April 2016, separated from her young daughter and her husband. \u201cHer continued detention, now nearly twice as long as mine, and the way in which this innocent and young family have been separated is criminal,\u201d says Rezaian. \u201cUnfortunately, Iran has a 40-year-long record of doing this. She will come home \u2026 but this should have never happened, and I\u2019m disgusted anew every time I think about it.\u201d The UK\u2019s foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has accused the Iranian government of using Zaghari-Ratcliffe as a \u201cpawn of diplomatic leverage\u201d. Rezaian bristles at the term being applied to him. \u201cI push back on the term \u2018pawn\u2019 because I think I was a little more valuable than that,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about chess, but at least call me the horse!\u201d He also resists the depiction of Iranian infighting as a good-v-evil struggle, pointing to shades of grey among Iran\u2019s moderates. Rezaian sees the IRGC faction as wanting to turn Iran into a much more absolutist regime, resembling North Korea, while the Rouhani circle would rather have something more like China, opening up to the world, but keeping the essence of the regime intact. \u201cThey want to have their cake and eat it,\u201d he says. He is not going to forget that the country\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif \u2013 urbane, fluent English-speaking and seen by many as a moderate in the regime \u2013 repeated espionage allegations against Rezaian in public and private as a means of justifying his continued detention during the nuclear talks. His jailers finally gave up their efforts to force him to confess to espionage, and his high profile as the Washington Post\u2019s Tehran correspondent meant they did not attempt physical torture, or fabricate evidence. In the absence of hard evidence, the prosecutors resorted to presenting the truth in a sinister light. The charges described more or less what Rezaian had set out to do with his journalism \u2013 humanise Iran and Iranians for an American audience. In the eyes of the court, this was his crime. His many articles about food and pastimes (his last report from Iran was about baseball enthusiasts) were no more than insidious efforts to sap Iran\u2019s revolutionary will and break down the walls protecting the purity of the Islamic Republic. Viewed from the outside, the secret court proceedings and blatantly spurious charges were farcical. Seen from inside a solitary confinement cell, by the light of lightbulbs that were never switched off, it was all ceaselessly cruel \u2013 and it has left its mark on Rezaian. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to stick with me for a very long time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt sounds trite, but my trust in the world has been shaken. Like many foreign correspondents, I used to be pretty intrepid in where I was willing to go. Now I\u2019m not. I have to have very concrete plans. I get anxious and paranoid if I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to get back to my hotel. All these things are so counter to the way that lived for so many years \u2026 I don\u2019t do well in crowds. And I don\u2019t do well in artificial lighting because I experienced it 24/7.\u201d Those fears have only grown deeper and darker since the murder of his Washington Post colleague Jamal Khashoggi in October last year. Just a few months earlier, they had been discussing their common experience of exile, and their contrasting impressions of each other\u2019s countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran \u2013 bitter rivals always ready to outdo each other in cruelty. \u201cWe were kindred spirits, in the sense that we both felt forced out of place \u2013 that these governments didn\u2019t want to see us in their midst any longer,\u201d Rezaian says of those conversations. \u201cHis murder had very immediate effects on me and my wife, psychologically.\u201d He followed Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, and the gruesome details of his killing and dismemberment from the Washington Post newsroom. He describes it as an eerie experience, knowing that his similar emergency could have ended just as darkly. \u201cAs vicious as they were in the way they talked to me, they were also human and made mistakes and there were some kindnesses,\u201d he says of his persecutors. \u201cThey very much believed they were doing God\u2019s work, and there was an element of trying to get you on their side: \u2018If you just follow our light you\u2019ll be safe.\u2019\u201d Unexpectedly, Rezaian\u2019s book is scattered with moments of comedy. Kazem, his interrogator, at one point forces him to call his mother, presumably in the belief that longing to see her would undermine the journalist\u2019s resolve. But the ploy backfires when Rezaian hands the phone to his jailor, saying his furious mother would like a word, forcing the hapless Kazem into tongue-tied retreat. After they gave up trying to get their captive to confess to being a spy, his interrogators spent much of their time with him debating politics and philosophy. Rezaian found himself looking forward to the interrogation sessions as a break from the monotony of incarceration. A deal for his release was finally reached between the Obama and Rouhani administrations in January 2016, involving a prisoner swap. Seven Iranians, six of them US dual nationals, were given clemency from sanctions-busting charges, while Rezaian was set free with two other dual-nationality prisoners and allowed to fly to the US with Yeganeh. The 2016 US presidential primaries were about to get under way, and in the last minutes as they waited for Rezaian\u2019s transport home to be arranged, his interrogators had a final question for him. \u201cWhile we still have you, explain to us about this electoral college,\u201d one of them demanded. \u201cIt makes no sense to us.\u201d Rezaian assured them they were not alone. Ten months later, it was the US electoral college system that assured Trump\u2019s election, despite Hillary Clinton winning the popular vote. Even before the primaries, Rezaian\u2019s Iranian captors predicted Donald Trump would become president, provoking a snort of derision from the returning American. \u201cYou guys are even dumber than I thought,\u201d he told them. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple,\u201d one of them replied. \u201cTrump is the candidate that hates Muslims most.\u201d Since his release, Rezaian has witnessed the Iranian\u2019s prediction come true and has seen Trump repudiate the nuclear deal it took so many years to negotiate, and which indirectly cost him his freedom. Talk of regime change is once again making the rounds of Washington\u2019s rightwing thinktanks, where Rezaian is sometimes invited to speak, on the mistaken assumption that his experience would have made him an enthusiastic cheerleader for Trump\u2019s campaign of maximum pressure. \u201cYou can hate the regime in Iran, and be opposed to the Trump administration\u2019s policies \u2013 in my experience, the majority of Iranian people feel that way,\u201d he argues. \u201cUnfortunately there is this zero-sum narrative in the US right now that these guys have to be ground down by whatever means necessary, and the Iranian people are going to thanks us later. I think that\u2019s disingenuous at best.\u201d Maximum pressure, the strangling of the Iranian economy, is only putting off real democratic change, Rezaian insists. It is a task best left to Iranians. \u201cThe Iranian people have seen through theocracy and have seen through authoritarianism. They want to be integrated into the world,\u201d he says. \u201cThey will have their day of reckoning. But we are not there yet.\u201d Prisoner \u2013 My 544 Days in an Iranian Prison by Jason Rezaian is published by HarperCollins.",

      "bodyText": "A Chinese surveillance company has been tracking the movements of at least 2.5 million residents in a province where Muslim minorities have been the target of a far-reaching security clampdown, internet experts have found. Victor Gevers, of the non-profit group GDI.Foundation, which supports an open internet, discovered an unsecured database online that contained the name, sex, ethnicity, ID number, birth date and employer of residents in China\u2019s western province of Xinjiang. It also included 6.7m location points of \u201ctrackers\u201d that residents had passed in the last 24 hours, including mosques, hotels, police stations and internet cafes. Trackers can be CCTV cameras as well as handheld devices equipped with cameras or ID scanners. In Emin county, trackers at five mosques in five villages were listed as having been \u201csuccessfully registered\u201d. The database, by Shenzhen-based SenseNets Technology, appeared to have been open and accessible by anyone for the last seven months. \u201cThis insecure face recognition/personal verification solution is built and operated for only one goal. It\u2019s a \u2018Muslim tracker\u2019 funded by Chinese authorities in the province of Xinjiang to keep track of Uyghur Muslims,\u201d Gevers posted on Twitter. China faces growing international criticism over its policies in Xinjiang, after a series of attacks in the 1990s and 2000s. Over the last three years, researchers and advocates believe 1 million Uighurs as well as Kazakhs, Hui and other Muslim minorities have been rounded up and detained in internment camps. Those outside the camp are also closely monitored, with surveillance cameras mounted over villages, street corners, mosques and schools. Commuters must go through security checkpoints between all towns and villages, where they undergo face scans and phone checks. Last year Xinjiang residents were reportedly ordered to download an app that scans for specific content. According to a report last year by Human Rights Watch, many Uighur families have QR codes fixed to their homes so local police can scan them for the family\u2019s details. SenseNets secured the database after Gevers flagged the breach. According to its website, the company offers \u201cintelligent video analysis\u201d, with facial recognition, real-time crowd analysis and verification software. Neither SenseNets nor the Xinjiang regional government have commented on the database. SenseNets works with Chinese police in several cities, including Wukan in Guangdong province, where mass protests were violently shut down in 2016 and the village put under tight control. SenseNets says on its website that its work with the local public security bureau has resulted in \u201coutstanding results\u201d in \u201cidentifying the troublemakers\u201d. In an ad in 2017, the company wrote: \u201cIn everyone\u2019s heart, there is beauty. The beauty of life is to hold and protect this beauty. Safety in cities is the beauty for SenseNets \u2026 We try out best to hold and protect this beauty.\u201d",

Surely resurrecting Cold Feet was just another example of a channel scraping the barrel by rehashing the past instead of coming up with something new? Well, I hold my hands up and admit it: I was wrong.</p> <p>Yes, the sixth series of Cold Feet was patchy, and even with the seventh, Bullen was still writing his way back to these characters. But the eighth series, which comes to an end this evening, has been must-watch TV: a well-balanced mix of drama and comedy that has accurately reflected the reality of life for many people, while wringing humour out of even the most heartbreaking moments.</p> <p>We\u2019ve seen Jenny (Fay Ripley) and Pete (Jon Thomson) deal with her breast cancer diagnosis, David (Robert Bathurst) slowly slip down the ladder into homelessness and Adam (James Nesbitt) and Karen (Hermione Norris) inch their way towards realising they love each other.</p> <p>This last plotline has been particularly well handled. Norris has long been Cold Feet\u2019s unsung MVP, her steadfast, sensible Karen able to keep her head when all around are losing theirs. Nesbitt, by contrast, is often the worst thing about Cold Feet. His bumptious Adam has always walked the line between lovable and irritating, and as his character aged, the Jack-the-lad charm curdled further.</p> <p>The brilliance of this series is that it sees that. From the opening episode, in which Adam made a fool of himself chatting up a series of younger women at Ramona\u2019s wedding, to the time he mistakenly believed a friendly barista must be attracted to him, it has been clear that he needs to grow up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e6bccf29832072922c8bfdb71f872ad1bc49e98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e6bccf29832072922c8bfdb71f872ad1bc49e98/0_311_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Absolutely believeable ...

Each knows the other\u2019s flaws and accepts that they will annoy each other, but they genuinely love each other and know that only this person will do. As a depiction of mature love it is smart, sensitive and absolutely believable.</p> <p>Bullen has been similarly astute in his depiction of Jenny\u2019s diagnosis. Cancer plotlines are tricky to pull off as the temptation to lapse into maudlin sentiment is immense. Bullen has been largely careful to avoid this. (I say largely because Cold Feet has always leaned in to sentiment \u2013 not for nothing did the king of romantic comedy, David Nicholls, cut his teeth here.) Instead, the plot has concentrated on Jenny\u2019s struggle for acceptance, her very real fears about the progression of the disease and last week, most movingly, what it means to her younger daughter Chloe, who is not Pete\u2019s natural child.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s David. Bathurst has always had the most difficult role in Cold Feet. The stiff and reserved David is often used as the force against which the other characters define themselves. Yet over the years, he is also the character who has changed the most.</p> <p>He has been tested by job losses and career shifts, shaken by the realisation that his place in the world is not guaranteed and slowly come to terms with his own upbringing and the damage it wrought. His slow slide into homelessness, and the way he wrestled with his pride rather than let those closest to him know, has been beautifully written. Like Jenny\u2019s illness, there is never the sense that this is issue TV but rather a well-told story in which a series of decisions lead a character, whom thanks to some great writing we truly care about, to a certain point in their lives.</p> <p>This, ultimately, is why this series of Cold Feet has been such a joy. It\u2019s partly the sense that for the first time since the revival was announced, we are truly hanging out with the characters we so enjoyed spending time with back in the day. And it\u2019s partly the fact that those characters have grown and changed as we have grown and changed with them. But mostly it\u2019s because while Cold Feet is at heart warm, comforting television, it is also a show driven by clever, mature writing that is confident enough to make us laugh in the most unexpected moments. Sometimes returning to the scene of past glories really does pay off.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cradling his grandchild for the first time, a man looks into the baby\u2019s face and sees the bearded, bespectacled features of Gerry Adams, former president of Sinn F\u00e9in. This would be alarming for any grandfather but even more so to a Belfast Protestant who sees Adams as a threat to the union between Ulster and Great Britain that Northern Irish loyalists cherish. Eric, in David Ireland\u2019s play Cyprus Avenue, is clearly in some way demented, but Stephen Rea makes him a complex and even moving examination of the consequences of one people being raised to hate another. The climax is so brutal that, at the performance I saw at the Royal Court in London in 2016, some audience members walked out. When the play ended, they were telling ushers that theatregoers should have been advised about the content in advance. \u201cI think most playwrights are against trigger warnings because they remove the tension,\u201d says Ireland. \u201cI had a play on in Belfast called Summertime. And I didn\u2019t know it had a trigger warning until I came to see it. The usher said, \u2018Oh, by the way, there are themes of child sexual abuse.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018If you tell them that, it gives away a big twist at the end of the play.\u2019\u201d For the Royal Court\u2019s revival of Cyprus Avenue, there is an age advisory (14+), and, as with all the London venue\u2019s productions now, a phone number that the potentially upset can ring, to ask if their particular triggering issue is going to come up. There might be a case for a hotline dedicated solely to the work of the burly 42-year-old Ireland. Ulster American, his most recent play, won awards at Edinburgh last August and is under discussion for a London production. It too caused walkouts and demands for advisories, especially for a scene \u2013 premiered soon after the #MeToo movement began \u2013 in which a Hollywood actor suggests a scenario in which criminal sexual behaviour might be justified. So does the writer regard such reactions as a tribute or an irritation? \u201cI really don\u2019t like it. Some people think that I like offending audiences. But I don\u2019t. Well, I suppose that, subconsciously, I may want to upset people, or I wouldn\u2019t write the things I write. But, consciously, I don\u2019t. I\u2019d really rather that people who were going to be offended stayed away.\u201d In a possible sign of softening, for the new production of Cyprus Avenue, Ireland is rewriting the opening scene to remove the N-word, after a cast member expressed unease. \u201cI\u2019ve always disliked that word in performance and questioned its relevance in the scene,\u201d admits the writer. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have changed it if it hadn\u2019t been raised by the actress.\u201d Commissioned by the Abbey theatre in Dublin, Cyprus Avenue did not reach the stage until three years after it had been written. The Abbey\u2019s lawyers were concerned about Adams\u2019 possible reaction. European privacy and image legislation raises questions about whether a living individual can be dramatically depicted without their permission, which Adams was unlikely to give. \u201cI don\u2019t know all the legal ins and outs. But then I only expected the play to be on for a couple of weeks in Dublin. So I thought he was unlikely to come after us.\u201d He laughs loudly. \u201cMaybe he will now!\u201d Having initially regarded Cyprus Avenue as a play \u201cabout the state of unionism\u201d, Ireland is now surprised to see it contains a private subtext. \u201cI\u2019d got married and we were talking about having children. I now realise that all this stuff went into it \u2013 about becoming a father, and my anxieties about what I would teach my children about their heritage, and who they are.\u201d Apart from testing audience sensitivities, Cyprus Avenue and Ulster American share an exploration of political and national identities.

I would say more so than nearly any other genre, blues and the roots of blues, gospel and everything that came from that - that's jazz, rock'n'roll, soul music, R&amp;B, this is all black artistry and there's no denying that. I think what's important is that you name that and you point to that artistry, you credit that wherever you can. I don't really have any solid answers, I can only approach that in good faith. When I reference the work of artists in one of my songs or in interviews, I get asked difficult questions about that, I just think it's important first and foremost to pay respect, to be clear in crediting the legacy that you're crediting, the artists that you owe so much to.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-18T14:04:18.480Z\">at 2.04pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c6aba3ce4b022557d2471d1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-18T14:00:08.397Z\">2.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">My favourite Seamus Heaney poem is St Kevin and the Blackbird, which is very beautiful and very dark</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101360392\">SweeeetThing </a>asks:</p> <p><em>Let\u2019s talk poetry!

The poem in one of the songs is called At the Wellhead, which is a poem about singing, but one of my all-time favourites is St Kevin and the Blackbird, which is very beautiful and very dark.

The Citizens' Assembly I thought was incredibly worthwhile as well, it did prove to be a very helpful democratic exercise. But for me it reaffirmed the idea and the fact that all things are fought for, all rights are fought for. It gave me a new appreciation of the rights we enjoy today that have already been fought for, that we take for granted. And it gave me great faith in the leadership shown by members of my generation.

It's literally the only thing that's of interest, the only thing human brains get a kick out of. The whole point is subverting the system and subverting an expected outcome, where you think the function will lead. I suppose that's where we get pleasure out of jokes, subverting the expectation. While I was home, I was asked a lot about the Irish concept of craic, and it translates roughly to fun, but I think it is more about subverting the expectation of social norms and subverting the expectation of social decency, and respect for oneself as well. I can't blame it all on being Irish but Irish people - if they're not taking the piss out of something, what's the point, really.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c6ab303e4b03c0232352e8f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-18T13:28:56.710Z\">1.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">My tattoo is Seamus Heaney's last words \u2013 Noli Timere.

The fact that he texted his wife that before he left the world is very tragic and very beautiful. The tattoo was done by a close friend of mine, an incredible artist called Stevie Appleby. I figured if someone was going to mark your skin forever, it should be someone you like. So he went at me with a needle and a bottle of ink one evening, a stick and poke.

It entrenched the Irish songwriter (born Andrew Hozier-Byrne) as one of the country\u2019s leading political pop voices: its video took a stand against the poor state of LGBTQ rights in Russia; a follow-up depicted the realities of domestic violence. The song went triple platinum and was nominated for song of the year at the 2015 Grammys \u2013 where he performed with Annie Lennox \u2013 and the 2015 Ivor Novello awards. After a hefty tour of his debut, Hozier returned in 2018 with the EP Nina Cried Power \u2013 featuring turns from Mavis Staples and instrumentation by Booker T Jones \u2013 the title track of which ended up on Barack Obama\u2019s songs of the year playlist. A proper follow-up to his debut is due on 1 March. Wasteland, Baby! tries to find human kindness in an apocalyptic world: the stream-of-consciousness vibe of single Almost (Sweet Music) conveys the chaos of the endeavour.

DrabWilly asks: Absolutely love your cover of Van Morrison\u2019s Sweet Thing. You free on May 29th for a wedding? Meal included.

GraceIsGone asks: Thanks for making \u201cDinner &amp; Diatribes\u201d available for us to hear. You do realise now that every time you\u2019re at a party, everyone\u2019s going to be watching you to see what your face says you\u2019re thinking about, and imagining what it might be? BronwynMcF asks: What book influenced you the most as a teenager and why? KimAlbright asks: You took an active part in pro-choice campaigning before the Irish abortion referendum. What are your main takeaways from the experience? MeganNewman asks: Hearing Shrike for the first time brought tears to my eyes, so I want to ask, what songs are tearjerkers for you? writeronthestorm asks: Would you do a Bond theme? Who do you think the next James Bond should be? Shimmertrap asks: Each one of your songs is so carefully crafted and consistently outstanding, and I\u2019m curious to know your songwriting process? Ally_H asks: You speak of \u201cHozier\u201d and \u201cAndrew\u201d as two sides of the same coin. Do you ever have trouble reconciling the two? Ally_H asks: Subversion plays a huge role in your music. From where does this desire to subvert norms and expectations stem, do you think? Anita_Inabsentia asks: On the cover art for Movement, you reveal a tattoo with Seamus Heaney\u2019s famous last words, \u201cNoli Timere\u201d. What do these words mean to you?

Between the self titled album and the songs you\u2019ve released from Wasteland, Baby! you\u2019ve used less female-oriented pronouns. Was that a conscious decision? gat123 asks: Your videos with dancer Sergei Polunin are amazing. But have his recent social media posts and the controversy they\u2019ve caused given you concern?

Celtiberico asks: If you\u2019re a Wicklow Quaker, did you or your family know a Miss Pim, in Bray?

What has prompted you to come out from behind your many guitars? ID0204923 asks: The desert blues guitar on Dinner &amp; Diatribes is so strong. Do you listen to much African music &amp; if so who?

      "bodyText": "The British aerospace sector is bracing for a no-deal Brexit, which it estimates could mean billions of pounds in extra costs. The impact on some goods could equate to 38% of their sale value, according to one no-deal Brexit scenario modelled by ADS, a lobby group for the aerospace and defence sectors. The group estimates that new customs checks alone will cost an extra \u00a31.5bn per year. While tariffs are less of an issue for the sector, as most finished aerospace parts are not caught by the levies, import VAT and tariffs on generic parts and raw materials could still add significant costs. That scenario also includes customs checks taking only 70 seconds per vehicle, which the Department for Transport estimates could cause six-day delays at the border. \u201cWhen you\u2019re selling an aircraft you can\u2019t have any parts missing,\u201d the chief economist at ADS, Jeegar Kakkad, said. \u201cOne part stops the whole process.\u201d The output of British aerospace manufacturers fell for the first time in four years in 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics, with concerns around global growth as well as Brexit clouding the outlook. Airbus, one of the UK\u2019s largest aerospace employers at its wing factory and design centre, has warned that a no-deal Brexit could cost it \u20ac1bn (\u00a3875m) per week, while indicating that it could leave the UK altogether in the event of a disorderly departure. Kakkad added that smaller suppliers are likely to be more vulnerable to problems with cashflow. The aerospace and defence sectors together employed more than 260,000 people in Britain in 2017, according to ADS figures but future expansion by non-British companies could be threatened if new frictions are introduced in the trade between the UK and the EU. Kakkad said: \u201cThe issue isn\u2019t about what we have now; it\u2019s if we look halfway through the next decade when decisions are being made on the next set of wings; the next supply chain.\u201d Airbus Rolls-Royce BAE Systems Bombardier Aerospace Boeing Babcock Cobham Leonardo Safran Lockheed Martin Meggitt Melrose GE Aviation QinetiQ Marshall Thales",

The reduction comes in spite of spectacular gains for the Greens in Germany and in Belgium\u2019s local elections. A poll at the weekend for the Belgian newspaper Le Soir put the Greens on course to become the largest party in Belgium\u2019s federal parliament in the elections that will take place on the same day as the European vote (26 May in Belgium).

      "body": "<p>Organised conspiracy theorist networks have launched an all-out information war across Europe. At the heart of this is the QAnon movement. It expanded from the US to Europe and the UK at rapid speed, hijacking political debates on social media as well as mass protests in the streets in recent months. Our <a href=\"https://www.isdglobal.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/The-Battle-for-Bavaria.pdf\" title=\"\">new analysis</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.isdglobal.org/\" title=\"\">Institute for Strategic Dialogue</a> shows that European conspiracy theorists run increasingly sophisticated campaigns around critical junctions in national, regional and global politics. They even carried out social media operations to influence voters in German state elections, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/14/bavaria-poll-humiliation-for-angela-merkel-conservative-allies\" title=\"\">2018 election in Bavaria</a>.</p> <p>The QAnon community, which began on the message-board site 4chan, strongly overlaps with the support networks of far-right movements such as the EDL and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2015/jan/06/pegida-what-does-german-far-right-movement-actually-stand-for\" title=\"\">Pegida</a>. Most recently, it co-opted yellow vest demonstrations and boosted hardline Brexit campaigns and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/09/antiracist-marchers-in-london-claim-they-had-more-than-double-the-support-of-far-right-protest\" title=\"\">Tommy Robinson protests</a>. By injecting conspiratorial narratives into these movements, its members can leverage existing networks and alter their political direction. A commonly used tactic is to combine conspiricist hashtags with those of viral campaigns and trending topics. The scale this generates is disproportional enough to distort public perception: In 2018, ISD identified close to 30m uses of the word \u201cQAnon\u201d across Twitter, YouTube and forums such as Reddit and 4chan.</p> <p>Ahead of the European parliamentary elections this May, the virality of conspiracy theories about the EU and the political establishment provides a fertile playground for populist parties. Groups such as Q Europe, Q Britannia and Q Deutschland are already gearing up to influence voting behaviour in a crucial election that will determine the future of the European project.</p> <p>QAnon adherents organise themselves on encrypted apps such as Discord and Telegram, linking the American-centred conspiracy theory to local contexts. Emotionally manipulative and tightly organised campaigns have allowed them to gather tens of thousands of supporters across Europe. They produce videos, disinformation databases and run trainings on meme creation and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump\" title=\"\">psychological warfare</a>. QAnon has even adopted its own currency, called \u201cInitiative Q\u201d, which its founders want to turn into \u201cthe next bitcoin\u201d.</p> <p>Across Europe, conspiracy theories that mix old antisemitic tropes with new ones that demonise migrants and Muslims have gained huge traction since the refugee crisis in 2015. A recent study showed that a stunning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/23/study-shows-60-of-britons-believe-in-conspiracy-theories\" title=\"\">60% of Brits believe in at least one conspiracy theory</a>. The ideas that a cabal of global elites run the world, that there is a plot to replace white English natives with Muslim migrants and that the authorities are covering up immigration numbers are among the most commonly held.</p> <p>In QAnon forums, it is hard to overlook the holy mess of logical fallacies and contradictions.

      "bodyText": "Organised conspiracy theorist networks have launched an all-out information war across Europe. At the heart of this is the QAnon movement. It expanded from the US to Europe and the UK at rapid speed, hijacking political debates on social media as well as mass protests in the streets in recent months. Our new analysis at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue shows that European conspiracy theorists run increasingly sophisticated campaigns around critical junctions in national, regional and global politics. They even carried out social media operations to influence voters in German state elections, including the 2018 election in Bavaria. The QAnon community, which began on the message-board site 4chan, strongly overlaps with the support networks of far-right movements such as the EDL and Pegida. Most recently, it co-opted yellow vest demonstrations and boosted hardline Brexit campaigns and Tommy Robinson protests. By injecting conspiratorial narratives into these movements, its members can leverage existing networks and alter their political direction. A commonly used tactic is to combine conspiricist hashtags with those of viral campaigns and trending topics. The scale this generates is disproportional enough to distort public perception: In 2018, ISD identified close to 30m uses of the word \u201cQAnon\u201d across Twitter, YouTube and forums such as Reddit and 4chan. Ahead of the European parliamentary elections this May, the virality of conspiracy theories about the EU and the political establishment provides a fertile playground for populist parties. Groups such as Q Europe, Q Britannia and Q Deutschland are already gearing up to influence voting behaviour in a crucial election that will determine the future of the European project. QAnon adherents organise themselves on encrypted apps such as Discord and Telegram, linking the American-centred conspiracy theory to local contexts. Emotionally manipulative and tightly organised campaigns have allowed them to gather tens of thousands of supporters across Europe. They produce videos, disinformation databases and run trainings on meme creation and psychological warfare. QAnon has even adopted its own currency, called \u201cInitiative Q\u201d, which its founders want to turn into \u201cthe next bitcoin\u201d. Across Europe, conspiracy theories that mix old antisemitic tropes with new ones that demonise migrants and Muslims have gained huge traction since the refugee crisis in 2015. A recent study showed that a stunning 60% of Brits believe in at least one conspiracy theory. The ideas that a cabal of global elites run the world, that there is a plot to replace white English natives with Muslim migrants and that the authorities are covering up immigration numbers are among the most commonly held. In QAnon forums, it is hard to overlook the holy mess of logical fallacies and contradictions. Its adherents link the MI6, Facebook and the Rothschilds to the Vatican, Hollywood, the Nazis, the Illuminati and aliens in order to explain that climate change is a hoax, the Holocaust never happened, the world is run by paedophiles, Satanists and cannibals and that the Queen is a direct descendent of prophet Mohammed. And yet this virtual cosmos of absurd stories can inspire real-world incidents: just last month, a QAnon supporter killed his brother, whom he thought was a lizard. \u201cCan me and my pals Raid MI6 DVD &amp; GO2 Offices in London ourselves please\u201d, another QAnon believer suggested in a private messaging app. Beyond inspiring attacks on perceived enemies, the spread of conspiracy theories can, in the long-term, sow societal divisions and undermine confidence in democratic processes, institutions and representatives. At a time when distrust in the political establishment runs exceptionally high, it is easy to tap into existing suspicions and fill information gaps with fabricated news and distorted statistics. The architecture of social media platforms plays into the hands of extreme fringe groups by pushing users towards sensationalist content. The tech firms\u2019 business models and algorithms are geared to maximise the time users spend on their platforms. Governments and big tech firms are slowly starting to push back against the systematic diffusion of disinformation.

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap. World stock markets have hit their highest level of 2019, as optimism builds that the US and China can calm their trade wars. As Associated Press puts it: On Friday, China and the U.S. announced plans to resume trade negotiations in Washington, fueling hopes that both countries were edging toward a deal. \u201cWe feel we have made headway on very, very important and difficult issues,\u201d U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Xi expressed hope for \u201ca mutually beneficial and win-win agreement,\u201d according to the official Xinhua News Agency. China\u2019s stock market led the rally, surging by over 3%. However, London isn\u2019t really joining the party - the FTSE 100 is down 5 points. The oil price was swept to a three-month high, with Brent crude close to $67 per barrel, after Donald Trump tweeted that progress was being made. But...there are also worries that Trump could open up a new trade row with Europe. He\u2019s received a new government report which outlines whether the EU auto industry is a national security threat - which could justify higher tariffs. Germany\u2019s Bundesbank remains cautious, predicting that growth will not rebound sharply after stagnating in the last quarter. Brexit is also looming over the UK economy, driving household financial confidence down to an 11-month low. With Wall Street closed for Presidents Day, there may be little more action today. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Brexit uncertainty, and fears of job losses, are eating into UK household confidence. British households grew more downbeat about their finances this month, according to data firm Markit. It\u2019s monthly healthcheck of household morale fell to just 43.4 this month, down from 44.7 in January. That\u2019s the worse reading for current financial wellbeing among UK households since March, pulled down by rising job insecurity. Heads-up, travellers -- staff at Luton Airport have voted to hold a week-long strike. Unite union members at GH London (a ground-handling service) are holding the walkout, in a protest over a pay freeze. It will run from 3rd to 10th March, potentially causing significant disruption to operations at the airport. Press Association has more details: GH London provides ground-handling services to Wizz Air at Luton Airport. Unite regional officer Jeff Hodge said: \u201cUnite has been calling for meaningful talks with GH London since the beginning of 2018. \u201cThis strike vote is a result of the company\u2019s failure to listen to its workforce who face a cut in their living standards. \u201cNow that the company is prepared to meet, we hope we can get constructive talks under way to resolve this dispute.\u201d Germany\u2019s central bank has given investors a dose of realism, warning that Europe\u2019s largest economy will continue to struggle for the next few months. In its latest monthly report, the Bundesbank said recent weak factory order - combined with signs that businesses are gloomy -- mean there\u2019s little hope of a strong rebound doon. The Bundesbank says: \u201cAll this suggests that the underlying pace of the economy should remain subdued at least in the first half of the year. \u201cBut there are no signs that the slowdown is becoming an outright downturn.\u201d Germany has just dodged a recession, after its GDP shrank in July-September but was flat between October and December. Shoe retailer Footasylum has been a particularly dire stock market performer of late. Having floated at 164p in November 2017, shares had slumped to just 30p last week - a serious loss for anyone who joined the IPO. But there\u2019s some relief today - shares have surged by 70% back to the giddy heights of 50p, after JD Sports announced it had bought an 8% stake, and could increase its holding to 29.9% \u2013 the maximum level permitted without triggering a bid. Footasylum was founded by retail entrepreneur David Makin -- who also co-founded JD Sports. The company is now run by his daughter Clare Nesbitt; she and two siblings still own around roughly half of Footasylum\u2019s shares, and made \u00a325m from that float. Take note, Donald Trump -- Europe says it will hit back if America decides its car industry is a national security threat. It\u2019s notable that markets are rallying despite weak US economic data last week -- poor factory output, and the biggest drop in retail sales in nine years. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains why: Markets are starting the week with a broad grin on their collective face. China\u2019s strong lending data and China/US trade optimism outweigh any concerns about what President Trump may do regarding Auto imports. The US has released two major economic indicators that send alarming signals about the US economy but for markets, policy (monetary and trade) outweighs such old-fashioned concerns as the economic cycle. It\u2019ll take more poor economic data to change that and while I\u2019m sure it\u2019s coming, it won\u2019t be today (Presidents\u2019 Day). Despite the weak open in Europe, global stock markets have hit their highest level in two and a half months. With China up 3% today, and Japan\u2019s Nikkei up 1.8% to its highest level this year, the MSCI\u2019s All-Country World Index has gained 0.3% to its highest level since 3rd December last year. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, explains: why stocks have risen: Trade talks between the US and China appear to be making good progress. Both sides issued positive remarks about the progress of the negotiations, including President Trump\u2019s admission that he may agree to an extension to the March the 1st deadline, maintaining the current level of tariffs on Chinese imported goods beyond that date. The news appears to have calmed the nerves of investors and as fears over an escalation in the trade conflict recede, so does the value of the Dollar. The US-China trade war optimism is being undermined by fears that Donald Trump could impose new tariffs on Europe\u2019s car industry. The US Department of Commerce has just filed a report, outlining whether the EU auto industry is a national security threat. Trump now has 90 days to read this \u201csection 232\u201d report, and decide whether to impose levies of up to 25% on imported vehicles, or components. The report is thought to focus on emerging technologies, at a time when the car industry is scrambling to develop better electric technologies as consumers shun diesel. America\u2019s Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association has already urge the White House not to open up a new trade dispute, saying: \u201cThese tariffs, if applied, could move the development and implementation of new automotive technologies offshore, leaving America behind. \u201cNot a single company in the domestic auto industry requested this investigation.\u201d This is weighing on European car stocks, with Volkswagen and Daimler both down 1%. That\u2019s put the German DAX into the red. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has also dipped in early trading, as Europe drops the bullish baton handed over by Asia overnight. The rise in the oil price is bad news for airline stocks, most of which are down this morning. International Airlines Group (British Airways\u2019 parent company) is leading the FTSE 100 fallers, down 2%. Budget airline Wizz Air has lost 1.4%, with easyJet dipping by 1%. The airline industry is also digesting the demise of UK operator FlyBMI over the weekend. It blamed Brexit uncertainty, and higher fuel and carbon costs, as it collapsed leaving thousands of travellers stranded or out of pocket. In the City, shares in household goods giant Reckitt Benckiser jumped 3% to the top of the FTSE 100 in early trading, after reporting decent results. Reckitt, whose brands includs Dettol, Nurofen and Air Wick, beat analyst forecasts with 4% like-for-like sales growth in the last three months. Chief executive Rakesh Kapoor (who is stepping down later this year) has told reporters that \u201cthe momentum is improving\u201d. RB posted strong growth in emerging markets and North America, but warned that Europe \u201cremains tough\u201d, due to a \u201cchallenging pricing environment\u201d. It also reported \u201ca strong performance\u201d in China, thanks to demand for Durex condoms and Dettol. But Strepsils sales have been hit by \u201ca weak start to the \u2018flu season\u201d [something for the rest of us to welcome, frankly] China\u2019s stock market has surged today, partly due to trade optimism. The CSI300 index of leading Chinese shares has gained more than 3%, meaning it has gained almost 15% already this year (after grim losses in 2018). Australia\u2019s ANZ Bank says: \u201cPositive signs in the U.S.-China trade talks helped boost sentiment across markets.\u201d New data showing Beijing\u2019s attempts to boost investment led to record new loans in January also cheered investors, according to Reuters. Other Asia-Pacific markets also posted gains, with South Korea\u2019s KOSPI up 0.7%, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng gaining 1.5% and Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 rising by 0.4%. Today\u2019s rally means Brent crude has risen by 25% since the start of the year, when it was trading around $53 per barrel. That reflects hopes that the US-China trade war will calm down, which would be good for global growth (and thus energy demand). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Hopes of a breakthrough in the US-China trade talks are ripping through the markets again, at the start of a new week. The oil price has jumped to a three-month high this morning, sending Brent crude to $66.76 per barrel - a level last seen in November. Asian markets have also rallied, following the news that trade talks between the U.S. and China will continue in Washington this week. That follows high-level meetings in Beijing last week which appeared to go well - without achieving anything concrete yet. Experienced City hands may remember the old joke that \u2018It\u2019s the hope that kills you\u2019. Reaching a significant deal between Beijing and Washington that actually addresses concerns about intellectual property, technology transfer, and trims the US-China trade deficit will be extremely tough. But Donald Trump has boosted optimism. After meeting with negotiators including trade secretary Steven Mnuchin, the president tweeted that \u201cBig progress\u201d is being made on \u201csoooo\u201d many levels (four \u2018o\u2019s must be good, right?!). So, an extension of the March 1st deadline - giving more time for a deal to be achieved - looks possible. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADSS, says trade will be a big issue this week. Risk appetite is on at the start of the week with currencies and equities buoyed by the signs of progress in the US-China trade talks. Trump\u2019s decision to declare a state of emergency didn\u2019t seem to bother investors too much as they\u2019ve grown accustomed to the US President\u2019s radical character and markets\u2019 focus lies squarely on any further progress on the trade front this week.,,, Regarding trade, the most recent news out of the talks between the US and China suggests that the two sides have come closer to each other and an extension to the March 1st deadline for increased tariffs appears likely. Otherwise it\u2019s looking like a quiet day, with nothing of note in the economics calendar. Wall Street will be closed for Presidents Day.",

      "body": "<p>There was, at last, a feeling of partial satisfaction and some optimism. A sixth defeat in seven games for lowly VfB Stuttgart is no reason for breaking out the party bunting but the manner, if not the result, felt like it might be a departure in the right direction.</p> \n<p>To an extent, it\u2019s an indication of just how bad it\u2019s been around the place in recent months. On the final day of last season, as they gleefully threw cake, jelly, and whipped the tablecloths off at Bayern Munich\u2019s title party with a 4-1 win, Stuttgart had positioned themselves at the gates of Europe. But then a late summer flounder became a full-blown autumnal panic, coach Tayfun Korkut was replaced by Markus Weinzierl, and the former Schalke boss had been unable to bring any sense of calm in nearly four months.</p> \n<p>In fact, it looks like the atmosphere defined Weinzierl, rather than the other way around. On the touchline during Saturday\u2019s loss to RB Leipzig, he flustered, flapped, frowned and growled his way along the touchline, as if his tracksuit top had been washed in a particularly insensitive brand of detergent. When his team won a first-half penalty, which Steven Zuber converted to equalise, Weinzierl fizzled with mania.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/18/mauro-icardi-internazionale-and-the-return-of-unwelcome-headlines\">Mauro Icardi, Internazionale and the return of unwelcome headlines | Paolo Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It hadn\u2019t been an easy week. After the rock bottom of last week\u2019s humiliating defeat at Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, it looked as if it might be curtains for the coach. It was always plain, though, that head of sport Michael Reschke would have to go if Weinzierl was to be removed. Two days after the D\u00fcsseldorf debacle, on Tuesday, Reschke was replaced by Thomas Hitzlsperger, the club\u2019s academy director and popular former player, who was a mainstay of the side that won the 2007 Bundesliga title. Uh oh.</p> \n<p>Yet here we are, nearly a week later, and Weinzierl is still in a job. Hitzlsperger has made clear that Weinzierl will still be the coach when they go north to take on Werder Bremen at the weekend, and even alluded to a long-term future with the current incumbent, his positivity doing much to inspire the more confident mood. Hitzlsperger may be new to the job and, at 36, a relative stripling at executive level, but he has made an immediate impression.</p> \n<p>Being associated with a more successful, happy era at the club doesn\u2019t hurt, but Hitzlsperger\u2019s demeanour exudes both balance and authority. Though senior players played down his impact and the man himself spoke of being \u201ceuphoric and energetic as never before\u201d, his leadership qualities are clear. He is that calm that the club \u2013 and the team \u2013 needed.</p> \n<p>Though Hitzlsperger backed Weinzierl, he did so only after extensive talks with the coach, which is how the latter \u201csaved his job\u201d, in the words of Stuttgarter Zeitung\u2019s Gerhard Pfisterer. The new man is keen to \u201cget everyone involved\u201d but has not hidden that he is involved in the immediate shaping of the first team, even if he says Weinzierl is taking the lead.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hitzlsperger has been in \u201call the meetings\u201d (his words) with the first team thus far and the renewed XI for the game with Leipzig was partly a result of his input. Weinzierl switched to three at the back and left out captain Christian Gentner, who watched from the bench while fully fit for the first time since Bruno Labbadia was coach in 2012. Gentner said post-match that this was \u201cno big deal\u201d, though Kicker wrote that Hitzlsperger had played a part in that decision.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy duty and responsibility,\u201d he told Sky, \u201cis to support him [Weinzierl] until we both come to the conclusion that we want to do something different.\u201d That united front is making some big decisions. Even with three centre-backs \u2013 including Benjamin Pavard, moved across after a wretched return at right-back at D\u00fcsseldorf \u2013 there was no place for Holger Badstuber, one of the club\u2019s most storied players, and one of its highest earners. Weinzierl said the former Bayern defender had been \u201ccompletely professional about it\u201d, but the shorter leash offered to senior players, with Mario G\u00f3mez only returning to the XI for this one after a run of games on the bench, suggests some sort of major change is afoot, on a weekend in which Lothar Matth\u00e4us took to Sky to criticise Stuttgart for placing their faith and money in veterans.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a49c85060fa79ad1e854498a8987dfaef43c5e8f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a49c85060fa79ad1e854498a8987dfaef43c5e8f/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Willi Orban of Leipzig and Andreas Beck compete for the ball.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Willi Orban of Leipzig and Andreas Beck compete for the ball.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sebastian Widmann/Bundesliga/DFL via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The contrast couldn\u2019t have been greater against Leipzig, a team built on the principle of giving precocious youth their chance. While Swabian eyes will always train on the returning Timo Werner, it was Yussuf Poulsen who again took centre-stage, leapfrogging the Germany forward with a brace that made him the club\u2019s top Bundesliga scorer (he now has 12 goals). The second was sublimely created by the midfielder Tyler Adams, in his third start since arriving from MLS. Having just turned 20, he is the latest example of Leipzig\u2019s successful model of going young.</p> \n<p>Still, Stuttgart had their moments against in-form visitors. Their own hope for the future, the newly-arrived Ozan Kabak, had a chance to put his team in front with the score 1-1, as did Sanitiago Ascacibar. As tends to happen to those at that end of the table, they found that their luck was as out, with a very dubious free-kick award against Kabak \u2013 described as \u201cridiculous\u201d by goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler \u2013 leading to Leipzig\u2019s crucial second goal, expertly curled in by Marcel Sabitzer.</p> \n<p>While there was defeat for Stuttgart, then, there was no despair. G\u00f3mez spoke of being \u201c1,000% sure\u201d his team would stay up. Hitzlsperger isn\u2019t daring to project too far forward. \u201cI\u2019m thinking very short term now,\u201d he told Sky, \u201cbecause if we don\u2019t reach our goals in the short term, it will be difficult in the long term.\u201d That lack of self-aggrandising, and his realism, suggests Hitzlsperger has every chance of succeeding.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 Bayern closed the gap at the top to two points by winning at Augsburg on Friday, despite going behind inside 14 seconds to Leon Goretzka\u2019s own goal and having to find a second equaliser before half-time, with Kingsley Coman the saviour on both occasions. Coman also created David Alaba\u2019s second-half winner. Little wonder that they were a little panicky over an ankle knock he picked up before the Champions League trip to Liverpool.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19f7aa0b5069c9b3c248172695679ad1b76f542b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19f7aa0b5069c9b3c248172695679ad1b76f542b/0_0_3500_2466/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mats Hummels applauds Bayern fans at the end of the match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mats Hummels applauds Bayern fans at the end of the match.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andreas Gebert/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 Borussia Dortmund attempt to respond at bottom club N\u00fcrnberg on Monday night, though they will be minus Marco Reus, Lukasz Piszczek and now Christian Pulisic.</p> \n<p>\u2022 It took until the 96th minute but Claudio Pizarro scored a deflected free-kick equaliser for Werder Bremen against Hertha to make himself the Bundesliga\u2019s oldest goalscorer at 40 years, four months and 13 days. This came after Max Kruse the other potential taker, asked him if he could \u201ckick it that far\u201d, while the Peruvian, who declared himself \u201cvery proud\u201d, now has his eyes on 200

      "bodyText": "There was, at last, a feeling of partial satisfaction and some optimism. A sixth defeat in seven games for lowly VfB Stuttgart is no reason for breaking out the party bunting but the manner, if not the result, felt like it might be a departure in the right direction. To an extent, it\u2019s an indication of just how bad it\u2019s been around the place in recent months. On the final day of last season, as they gleefully threw cake, jelly, and whipped the tablecloths off at Bayern Munich\u2019s title party with a 4-1 win, Stuttgart had positioned themselves at the gates of Europe. But then a late summer flounder became a full-blown autumnal panic, coach Tayfun Korkut was replaced by Markus Weinzierl, and the former Schalke boss had been unable to bring any sense of calm in nearly four months. In fact, it looks like the atmosphere defined Weinzierl, rather than the other way around. On the touchline during Saturday\u2019s loss to RB Leipzig, he flustered, flapped, frowned and growled his way along the touchline, as if his tracksuit top had been washed in a particularly insensitive brand of detergent. When his team won a first-half penalty, which Steven Zuber converted to equalise, Weinzierl fizzled with mania. It hadn\u2019t been an easy week. After the rock bottom of last week\u2019s humiliating defeat at Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, it looked as if it might be curtains for the coach. It was always plain, though, that head of sport Michael Reschke would have to go if Weinzierl was to be removed. Two days after the D\u00fcsseldorf debacle, on Tuesday, Reschke was replaced by Thomas Hitzlsperger, the club\u2019s academy director and popular former player, who was a mainstay of the side that won the 2007 Bundesliga title. Uh oh. Yet here we are, nearly a week later, and Weinzierl is still in a job. Hitzlsperger has made clear that Weinzierl will still be the coach when they go north to take on Werder Bremen at the weekend, and even alluded to a long-term future with the current incumbent, his positivity doing much to inspire the more confident mood. Hitzlsperger may be new to the job and, at 36, a relative stripling at executive level, but he has made an immediate impression. Being associated with a more successful, happy era at the club doesn\u2019t hurt, but Hitzlsperger\u2019s demeanour exudes both balance and authority. Though senior players played down his impact and the man himself spoke of being \u201ceuphoric and energetic as never before\u201d, his leadership qualities are clear. He is that calm that the club \u2013 and the team \u2013 needed. Though Hitzlsperger backed Weinzierl, he did so only after extensive talks with the coach, which is how the latter \u201csaved his job\u201d, in the words of Stuttgarter Zeitung\u2019s Gerhard Pfisterer. The new man is keen to \u201cget everyone involved\u201d but has not hidden that he is involved in the immediate shaping of the first team, even if he says Weinzierl is taking the lead. Hitzlsperger has been in \u201call the meetings\u201d (his words) with the first team thus far and the renewed XI for the game with Leipzig was partly a result of his input. Weinzierl switched to three at the back and left out captain Christian Gentner, who watched from the bench while fully fit for the first time since Bruno Labbadia was coach in 2012. Gentner said post-match that this was \u201cno big deal\u201d, though Kicker wrote that Hitzlsperger had played a part in that decision. \u201cMy duty and responsibility,\u201d he told Sky, \u201cis to support him [Weinzierl] until we both come to the conclusion that we want to do something different.\u201d That united front is making some big decisions. Even with three centre-backs \u2013 including Benjamin Pavard, moved across after a wretched return at right-back at D\u00fcsseldorf \u2013 there was no place for Holger Badstuber, one of the club\u2019s most storied players, and one of its highest earners. Weinzierl said the former Bayern defender had been \u201ccompletely professional about it\u201d, but the shorter leash offered to senior players, with Mario G\u00f3mez only returning to the XI for this one after a run of games on the bench, suggests some sort of major change is afoot, on a weekend in which Lothar Matth\u00e4us took to Sky to criticise Stuttgart for placing their faith and money in veterans. The contrast couldn\u2019t have been greater against Leipzig, a team built on the principle of giving precocious youth their chance. While Swabian eyes will always train on the returning Timo Werner, it was Yussuf Poulsen who again took centre-stage, leapfrogging the Germany forward with a brace that made him the club\u2019s top Bundesliga scorer (he now has 12 goals). The second was sublimely created by the midfielder Tyler Adams, in his third start since arriving from MLS. Having just turned 20, he is the latest example of Leipzig\u2019s successful model of going young. Still, Stuttgart had their moments against in-form visitors. Their own hope for the future, the newly-arrived Ozan Kabak, had a chance to put his team in front with the score 1-1, as did Sanitiago Ascacibar. As tends to happen to those at that end of the table, they found that their luck was as out, with a very dubious free-kick award against Kabak \u2013 described as \u201cridiculous\u201d by goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler \u2013 leading to Leipzig\u2019s crucial second goal, expertly curled in by Marcel Sabitzer. While there was defeat for Stuttgart, then, there was no despair. G\u00f3mez spoke of being \u201c1,000% sure\u201d his team would stay up. Hitzlsperger isn\u2019t daring to project too far forward. \u201cI\u2019m thinking very short term now,\u201d he told Sky, \u201cbecause if we don\u2019t reach our goals in the short term, it will be difficult in the long term.\u201d That lack of self-aggrandising, and his realism, suggests Hitzlsperger has every chance of succeeding. Talking points \u2022 Bayern closed the gap at the top to two points by winning at Augsburg on Friday, despite going behind inside 14 seconds to Leon Goretzka\u2019s own goal and having to find a second equaliser before half-time, with Kingsley Coman the saviour on both occasions. Coman also created David Alaba\u2019s second-half winner. Little wonder that they were a little panicky over an ankle knock he picked up before the Champions League trip to Liverpool. \u2022 Borussia Dortmund attempt to respond at bottom club N\u00fcrnberg on Monday night, though they will be minus Marco Reus, Lukasz Piszczek and now Christian Pulisic. \u2022 It took until the 96th minute but Claudio Pizarro scored a deflected free-kick equaliser for Werder Bremen against Hertha to make himself the Bundesliga\u2019s oldest goalscorer at 40 years, four months and 13 days. This came after Max Kruse the other potential taker, asked him if he could \u201ckick it that far\u201d, while the Peruvian, who declared himself \u201cvery proud\u201d, now has his eyes on 200 Bundesliga goals (he currently has 193).",

Average house prices in Britain have skyrocketed by more than 270% over the past two decades \u2013 with a significant acceleration for property values since the financial crisis a decade ago \u2013 pushing homes out of reach for growing numbers of people. The ONS study revealed that the average age by which more than 50% of the population lived in a home they owned had been 28 as recently as 2007, meaning the bulk of the shift since 1997 has taken place in the past decade. The analysis underlines the shifting living standards of millennials in Britain amid growing concerns that those born between the mid-1980s and mid-90s could be the first generation in modern history to experience worse economic conditions than their parents. Factors that have exacerbated the housing issues facing millennials could include the rising cost of an entry-level property and the introduction of stricter mortgage lending rules introduced after the 2008 financial crisis, according to the ONS.

Israel later conceded that Poland\u2019s absence meant the V4, with only three of the four members attending, would be cancelled. \u201cThere will be no full V4 meeting,\u201d Emmanuel Nahshon, a spokesman for Israel\u2019s foreign ministry, said. Poland\u2019s foreign ministry has summoned the Israeli ambassador twice in three days, and the head of the Polish prime minister\u2019s office, Micha\u0142 Dworczyk, said the Israeli foreign minister\u2019s comments were \u201cdisgraceful\u201d . Poland\u2019s chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, also released a statement saying Katz\u2019s comments had offended Polish Jews. Katz told Israel\u2019s Army Radio on Monday he wanted to maintain good relations with Poland, but went on to criticise all Poles. He said: \u201cHistorical truth cannot be changed. Many Poles collaborated with the Nazis and took part in the destruction of the Jews during the Holocaust \u2026 Antisemitism was innate among the Poles before the Holocaust, during it and after it too.\u201d Before the second world war, Poland was home to one of the world\u2019s largest Jewish communities, which was almost wiped out by the Nazis. After Germany occupied the country in 1939, the underground resistance fought the Nazis and tried to warn the world about the Holocaust. Many Poles do not accept research showing thousands also participated in the Holocaust. Critics accuse the nationalist government in Poland of whitewashing instances of collaboration. Israel complained to Warsaw last year when legislation was introduced that would have made the use of phrases such as \u201cPolish death camps\u201d punishable by up to three years in prison. The legislation was later watered down and prison sentences removed. Netanyahu had hoped central European countries would act as an ally for Israel against other European nations critical of its occupation of the Palestinian territories. Danny Danon, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UN, said these allies had already helped to block a movement to condemn the decision by Donald Trump to recognise the contested city of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. However, Netanyahu has long been criticised by domestic opponents for ignoring historical revisionism and antisemitism in central Europe. Yair Lapid, the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party in Israel and the son of a Holocaust survivor, tweeted that Netanyahu \u201cshould have told the Polish prime minister: cancel the plane ticket now, don\u2019t come here, because we don\u2019t grovel over the memory of the Holocaust\u201d. Lapid had previously condemned the summit, saying its invitees included a prime minister who \u201cpublishes antisemitic content\u201d and another who desecrates the memories of Holocaust victims. \u201cIt\u2019s a loss for all national pride,\u201d he said.",

Carl Beech, 51, told police that as a child he was among victims of a group of establishment figures \u2013 including senior politicians and military figures \u2013 who he alleged raped and murdered boys in the 1970s and 1980s. The allegations led to a \u00a32.5m Scotland Yard inquiry, Operation Midland, which was closed in 2016 without any arrests. Beech, known under the alias \u201cNick\u201d before being stripped of his anonymity by a judge last year, faces 12 charges of perverting the course of justice during the period from December 2012 to March 2016, and one count of fraud over a criminal compensation payout he received. Appearing via video link from prison, a grey-bearded Beech, flanked by his solicitor, pleaded not guilty to each of the 13 counts at a hearing at Newcastle crown court on Monday morning. Among the charges, which were read to Beech in court, is one in which he is said to have made a false allegation of witnessing the murder of an unnamed child by the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor. The court also heard Beech is accused of falsely claiming to have witnessed the murder of two other children. He is also accused of falsely alleging that he was \u201csexually and physically abused by a paedophile ring, with politicians, a TV presenter, and other unidentified men accused as members\u201d. Beech is charged with falsely claiming to have drawn sketches from memory of locations where he was abused and producing a penknife he said he had retained from the time. He is also accused of setting up a fake email account and providing false information from a man called \u201cFred\u201d, whom Beech had named as being present when he was abused by the paedophile ring. The recorder of Newcastle, Judge Paul Sloan QC, remanded Beech in custody before trial on 7 May.

      "bodyText": "For the past week the Syrian Democratic Forces have been trying to defeat the last remnants of Islamic State that fortified themselves in the small town located on the banks of the Euphrates River, near the Iraqi border. Women and children, who fled heavy conflict between the SDF and Isis in Baghuz, sit in front of a tent inside a civilian screening point for suspected Isis families Standing on top of a hill, six miles (10km) from Baghuz we could see the cloud of dust coming closer as minutes passed. As it approached we could see a dozen trucks driving in a convoy, carrying people away from heavy fighting in the city. Escape routes Trucks on the move As the trucks came to a stop I could see women, children and older men crammed on the back. These were civilians that fled the fighting to seek shelter behind what up until a few days ago they considered enemy lines. Civilians arrive at an SDF forward screening point Two young girls wearing red coats look around, confused, as the back doors of the truck open. Their mother is trying to make more space for all of them to sit before continuing their journey to the al-Hawl refugee camp where families believed to be related to Isis members are taken by the SDF. Nearby, a man holding a child extends his hand towards a woman trying to climb up on the back of another truck, while a young woman looks at me through her niqab. Suspected Isis families are seen inside a truck that will transport them to an camp for internally displaced people (IDP) after fleeing Baghuz Children in the back of a truck hide their faces We see on the horizon a group of civilians making their way towards us on foot. A man carrying his few belongings is followed by two children who fled the town with their father earlier that day. SDF soldiers and Free Burma Rangers, who provide voluntary medical care, rush towards them. They check the people and their belongings for improvised explosive devices and then help them up a steep hill. The last to come up the hill is an older man wrapped in a traditional coat often seen in this region, his shoes falling apart. A soldier helps him climb up the hill and lets him sit on the ground to rest. An SDF soldier helps a man who fled heavy fighting in the city of Baghuz reach a civilian collection point for suspected Isis families Battleground Members of the SDF seen on the rooftop of a building, located on the outskirts of Baghuz We leave and head towards the front. Eight of us are crammed in the back of an armoured car. As we approach the city I look through the reinforced glass window at pulverised buildings, cars and trucks. We arrive at an outpost of the SDF near the frontline and we are rushed up a flight of stairs. \u201cStay low,\u201d the commander tells us as we exit on to the rooftop. A young SDF soldier looks through a hole on the wall towards an Isis position while his commander speaks on the radio and coordinates with another group located in a nearby outpost. After a while we head downstairs and I am offered a cup of tea. We sit with the soldiers and have a cigarette. They seem relaxed, but also anxious for the operation to finish. A SDF advanced observation post overlooking the city of Baghuz A member of the SDF observes Isis positions in Baghuz Left behind An abandoned shelter The next day we head for the frontline. On our way we stop at a screening point outside the town. The place is empty. A big tent full of discarded blankets, used by people who fled the previous day and spent the night there, sits empty in the middle of a temporary camp nearby. Women and children sit on blankets with their few belongings at a civilian screening point I hear voices and turn around to see a group of people making their way towards me.

      "body": "<p>The first time the big screen cut to Mauro Icardi, it stayed with him for only a few seconds. He had arrived just before kick-off for Inter\u2019s game against Sampdoria, taking a seat beside his wife, and agent, Wanda in the stands at San Siro. Neither seemed to notice when the cameras picked them out, provoking brief jeers from the home crowd.</p> \n<p>But the camera lingered a little longer the second time around. Play had stopped, and the mood inside the stadium was restless, with the score still goalless after the interval. This time the whistles were ear-splitting. Wanda glanced up at the screen, and quickly cast her eyes back down.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/18/thomas-hitzlsperger-makes-swift-impact-at-struggling-stuttgart-bundesliga-football\">Thomas Hitzlsperger makes swift impact at struggling Stuttgart | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Four days had passed since Icardi was stripped of the captaincy: a decision which the manager, Luciano Spalletti, explained thus: \u201cThere are certain things surrounding the lad which need to be fixed. These things have caused, and continue to cause, embarrassment to the team and the club of which he was captain.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chief among those \u2018things\u2019 was presumed to be Wanda, and her habit for creating unwelcome headlines. A regular on Mediaset\u2019s football talk show Tiki Taka, she had criticised her husband\u2019s team-mates for not passing him the ball enough. \u201cMore than giving Mauro a new contract,\u201d she observed, \u201cI\u2019d prefer Inter to sign someone capable of giving him five good balls in every game.\u201d</p> \n<p>There was more to Inter\u2019s decision than a single remark. It had been precipitated by a meeting of the club\u2019s directors, led by Beppe Marotta. Appointed as CEO for sporting activity in December, this felt like an instance of the former Juventus man seeking to establish his leadership on a key issue. He had the backing of many Inter supporters. Icardi finished as Serie A\u2019s joint-top scorer last season, but goals alone do not make a captain. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/17/mauro-icardi-v-inters-ultras-an-unhappy-chapter-in-his-ongoing-san-siro-saga\">Ultras have not forgotten</a> the incendiary autobiography the player released in 2016, in which he threatened to \u201cbring 100 criminals from Argentina\u201d to kill those who had menaced him as the team struggled.</p> \n<p>More recently, there had been reports of a squad divided: with cliques said to have formed inside the Inter changing room. Fresh fuel was thrown on that fire when Marcelo Brozovic hit \u2018like\u2019 on Inter\u2019s tweet announcing that Samir Handanovic had replaced Icardi as captain.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Argentinian opted out of Thursday\u2019s Europa League trip to Rapid Vienna, having initially been named in the squad. He was subsequently omitted from the team to face Sampdoria. Spalletti said he was pleased Icardi chose to come and watch anyway, though he would have preferred it if his striker had come down to celebrate with team-mates at the end of an eventual 2-1 win.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/17/pro-piacenza-beaten-20-0-serie-c-cuneo\">Pro Piacenza beaten 20-0 after naming team of just seven teenagers</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was certainly an encouraging victory. Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, starting up front in Icardi\u2019s absence, delivered another strong performance after scoring the only goal against Rapid. He interprets the role very differently to his compatriot, offering greater movement and contribution to build-up play if also a less consistent presence inside the box.</p> \n<p>It was tempting to wonder whether Icardi might have done better with a majestic early ball from from Roberto Gagliardini. Mart\u00ednez had the goal at his mercy, but shot too close to keeper Emil Audero. Yet he created opportunities for those around him. It was Mart\u00ednez who volleyed first-time into the path of Radja Nainggolan, before the Belgian fired just wide. It was he again whocreated space for Ivan Perisic to race clear before being thwarted by an excellent save from Audero.</p> \n<p>Perisic made amends by setting up Inter\u2019s first goal, dribbling in from the left and crossing for Danilo D\u2019Ambrosio to score. Samp equalised moments later, Manolo Gabbiadini finishing coolly after a scramble, but the <em>Nerazzurri</em> delivered an immediate response, Nainggolan waiting on the edge of the box to convert a half-cleared corner.</p> \n<p>As Inter\u2019s former captain watched from the stand, team-mates who had likewise failed to show leadership were finally standing up to be counted. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/27/ivan-perisic-arsenal-transfer-request\">This was supposed to be a big year for Perisic</a>, coming off a starring role for Croatia at the World Cup, yet he has only scored as many league goals in six months for his club as he did in seven games for his country last summer. Nainggolan, likewise, has underperformed \u2013 as well as being beset by injuries.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bfd04b1928ec1bf4e75a3aa5ae201fae03ddac7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bfd04b1928ec1bf4e75a3aa5ae201fae03ddac7/0_0_3072_1821/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Radja Nainggolan celebrates after making it 2-1.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"593\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Radja Nainggolan celebrates after making it 2-1.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matteo Bazzi/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The latter player already appeared to have turned over a new leaf, shedding four kilos since the start of the year thanks to a new diet and training regime. He had spoken about taking responsibility and growing up in the wake of Inter\u2019s previous league win, away to Parma.</p> \n<p>Inter\u2019s hope now is that Icardi may follow such examples. Wanda was back on Tiki Taka on Sunday night when Marotta phoned in with a conciliatory message. \u201cThe decision [to strip Icardi of the captaincy] was not a disciplinary measure,\u201d he said. \u201cHeads of families need to take difficult decisions sometimes when it comes to their children, to help them grow. Icardi is only 25 years old.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hostility toward the player has reached unacceptable levels in some quarters, and Wanda said that they missed Sunday\u2019s celebrations only after being advised to leave early for security reasons. A rock had been thrown at her car the day before, striking the windscreen as she was driving her three sons to a football game.</p> \n<p>Marotta was among the first to call offering support: a reminder that it is possible to hold professional disagreements without abandoning human decency. Icardi\u2019s future remains cloudy, but the director insists a fresh contract offer is on the way. This latest win can only strengthen his negotiating position.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 Six goals in five games now for Krzysztof Pi\u0105tek since joining Milan, and a big win for the <em>Rossoneri</em> over Atalanta in the fight for the top four. A very different story for Napoli, who despite restoring Arkadiusz Milik to the starting XI, failed to score for the third time in four games.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9294eb5a79134ac4ae7491ed19dfc5cb1079252e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9294eb5a79134ac4ae7491ed19dfc5cb1079252e/0_0_3072_2048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Piatek does it again, scoring in the win at Atalanta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Piatek does it again, scoring in the win at Atalanta.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paolo Magni/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 The perfect VAR storm: a goal disallowed at one end and a penalty awarded at the other. Spal thought they had taken a 2-1 lead late against Fiorentina but replays showed Federico Chiesa had been fouled during the Viola\u2019s preceding attack. The correct decision was reached and the correct process followed by the officiating team \u2013 with referee Luca Pairetto opting not to blow his whistle prematurely when unsure and waiting instead for the next stoppage. But inevitably it felt like a huge injustice to Spal, who imploded and lost 4-1.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1097122870906535936\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\ude28 Absolute drama!<br><br>The referee has disallowed a goal for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/spalferrara?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@spalferrara</a> after consulting VAR! \u274c<br><br>And he has awarded a penalty at the other end of the field for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/acffiorentina?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@acffiorentina</a>!\ud83d\ude33<br><br>Should it have been a penalty?<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SerieA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SerieA</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/DvgGy16Nip\">pic.twitter.com/DvgGy16Nip</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1097122870906535936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 17, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 That was still not the biggest footballing controversy, as third-tier Pro Piacenza fielded just seven players (six teenagers, plus the 39-year-old team masseur) for their game against Cuneo \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/17/pro-piacenza-beaten-20-0-serie-c-cuneo\">duly lost 20-0</a>. In dire financial straits, the club has reportedly failed to pay wages since August and forfeited its previous three games due to lack of personnel. A further abandonment would have meant getting thrown out of the league, though it is hard to envisage a much brighter future after this debacle, which Italian football federation president Gabriele Gravina described as \u201can insult to sport and its founding principles\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9671ff4d-50b9-43a8-a850-71d92e2369c3\"

      "bodyText": "The first time the big screen cut to Mauro Icardi, it stayed with him for only a few seconds. He had arrived just before kick-off for Inter\u2019s game against Sampdoria, taking a seat beside his wife, and agent, Wanda in the stands at San Siro. Neither seemed to notice when the cameras picked them out, provoking brief jeers from the home crowd. But the camera lingered a little longer the second time around. Play had stopped, and the mood inside the stadium was restless, with the score still goalless after the interval. This time the whistles were ear-splitting. Wanda glanced up at the screen, and quickly cast her eyes back down. Four days had passed since Icardi was stripped of the captaincy: a decision which the manager, Luciano Spalletti, explained thus: \u201cThere are certain things surrounding the lad which need to be fixed. These things have caused, and continue to cause, embarrassment to the team and the club of which he was captain.\u201d Chief among those \u2018things\u2019 was presumed to be Wanda, and her habit for creating unwelcome headlines. A regular on Mediaset\u2019s football talk show Tiki Taka, she had criticised her husband\u2019s team-mates for not passing him the ball enough. \u201cMore than giving Mauro a new contract,\u201d she observed, \u201cI\u2019d prefer Inter to sign someone capable of giving him five good balls in every game.\u201d There was more to Inter\u2019s decision than a single remark. It had been precipitated by a meeting of the club\u2019s directors, led by Beppe Marotta. Appointed as CEO for sporting activity in December, this felt like an instance of the former Juventus man seeking to establish his leadership on a key issue. He had the backing of many Inter supporters. Icardi finished as Serie A\u2019s joint-top scorer last season, but goals alone do not make a captain. Ultras have not forgotten the incendiary autobiography the player released in 2016, in which he threatened to \u201cbring 100 criminals from Argentina\u201d to kill those who had menaced him as the team struggled. More recently, there had been reports of a squad divided: with cliques said to have formed inside the Inter changing room. Fresh fuel was thrown on that fire when Marcelo Brozovic hit \u2018like\u2019 on Inter\u2019s tweet announcing that Samir Handanovic had replaced Icardi as captain. The Argentinian opted out of Thursday\u2019s Europa League trip to Rapid Vienna, having initially been named in the squad. He was subsequently omitted from the team to face Sampdoria. Spalletti said he was pleased Icardi chose to come and watch anyway, though he would have preferred it if his striker had come down to celebrate with team-mates at the end of an eventual 2-1 win. It was certainly an encouraging victory. Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, starting up front in Icardi\u2019s absence, delivered another strong performance after scoring the only goal against Rapid. He interprets the role very differently to his compatriot, offering greater movement and contribution to build-up play if also a less consistent presence inside the box. It was tempting to wonder whether Icardi might have done better with a majestic early ball from from Roberto Gagliardini. Mart\u00ednez had the goal at his mercy, but shot too close to keeper Emil Audero. Yet he created opportunities for those around him. It was Mart\u00ednez who volleyed first-time into the path of Radja Nainggolan, before the Belgian fired just wide. It was he again whocreated space for Ivan Perisic to race clear before being thwarted by an excellent save from Audero. Perisic made amends by setting up Inter\u2019s first goal, dribbling in from the left and crossing for Danilo D\u2019Ambrosio to score. Samp equalised moments later, Manolo Gabbiadini finishing coolly after a scramble, but the Nerazzurri delivered an immediate response, Nainggolan waiting on the edge of the box to convert a half-cleared corner. As Inter\u2019s former captain watched from the stand, team-mates who had likewise failed to show leadership were finally standing up to be counted. This was supposed to be a big year for Perisic, coming off a starring role for Croatia at the World Cup, yet he has only scored as many league goals in six months for his club as he did in seven games for his country last summer. Nainggolan, likewise, has underperformed \u2013 as well as being beset by injuries. The latter player already appeared to have turned over a new leaf, shedding four kilos since the start of the year thanks to a new diet and training regime. He had spoken about taking responsibility and growing up in the wake of Inter\u2019s previous league win, away to Parma. Inter\u2019s hope now is that Icardi may follow such examples. Wanda was back on Tiki Taka on Sunday night when Marotta phoned in with a conciliatory message. \u201cThe decision [to strip Icardi of the captaincy] was not a disciplinary measure,\u201d he said. \u201cHeads of families need to take difficult decisions sometimes when it comes to their children, to help them grow. Icardi is only 25 years old.\u201d Hostility toward the player has reached unacceptable levels in some quarters, and Wanda said that they missed Sunday\u2019s celebrations only after being advised to leave early for security reasons. A rock had been thrown at her car the day before, striking the windscreen as she was driving her three sons to a football game. Marotta was among the first to call offering support: a reminder that it is possible to hold professional disagreements without abandoning human decency. Icardi\u2019s future remains cloudy, but the director insists a fresh contract offer is on the way. This latest win can only strengthen his negotiating position. Talking points \u2022 Six goals in five games now for Krzysztof Pi\u0105tek since joining Milan, and a big win for the Rossoneri over Atalanta in the fight for the top four. A very different story for Napoli, who despite restoring Arkadiusz Milik to the starting XI, failed to score for the third time in four games. \u2022 The perfect VAR storm: a goal disallowed at one end and a penalty awarded at the other. Spal thought they had taken a 2-1 lead late against Fiorentina but replays showed Federico Chiesa had been fouled during the Viola\u2019s preceding attack. The correct decision was reached and the correct process followed by the officiating team \u2013 with referee Luca Pairetto opting not to blow his whistle prematurely when unsure and waiting instead for the next stoppage. But inevitably it felt like a huge injustice to Spal, who imploded and lost 4-1. \u2022 That was still not the biggest footballing controversy, as third-tier Pro Piacenza fielded just seven players (six teenagers, plus the 39-year-old team masseur) for their game against Cuneo \u2013 and duly lost 20-0. In dire financial straits, the club has reportedly failed to pay wages since August and forfeited its previous three games due to lack of personnel. A further abandonment would have meant getting thrown out of the league, though it is hard to envisage a much brighter future after this debacle, which Italian football federation president Gabriele Gravina described as \u201can insult to sport and its founding principles\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cThis is the biggest and most important fight of my career,\u201d Chris Eubank Jr says quietly, rocking gently on a plastic chair in a tiny office tucked away in his gym on Hove seafront. He nods intently as he considers his battle against James DeGale at the O2 in London on Saturday night. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the one where I have the most to lose. A loss would leave me in no man\u2019s land. DeGale is in exactly the same position. We both cannot afford defeat. We\u2019re both on the edge and someone\u2019s going to fall.\u201d</p> <p>I have asked just one opening question and Eubank has cut to the heart. He and DeGale are preparing for a bout which will surely leave the loser facing the end of his career. Of course this is boxing and so a controversial decision or a narrow defeat might persuade the defeated fighter that one last shot at redemption is possible. But both men recognise their future, and long-term reputations, could be decided this weekend.</p> <p>DeGale has been around boxing so long, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jan/06/james-degale-donald-mcrae-interview-boxing\" title=\"\">as an Olympic gold medallist</a> and a two-times IBF super-middleweight champion, it\u2019s surprising to think he has had one fight fewer than Eubank, whose record is 27-2. At 33, DeGale <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/09/james-de-gale-badou-jack-fear-ibf-world-super-middleweight-champion-title-unification\" title=\"\">has achieved far more</a> but he has also been through more wars.

DeGale also lost to Groves, his bitter rival, but went on an unbeaten run that lasted six-and-a-half years before he dropped a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/10/james-degale-caleb-truax-fight-report\" title=\"\">shock decision to Caleb Truax.</a> That loss was avenged last April but DeGale has been ravaged by injury and weariness. He is more skilful than Eubank but the younger man is desperate for the big win that would move him beyond the shadow of his father, Chris Sr, who was such a powerful if eccentric presence in the 1990s.</p> <p>This contest also carries some spite. After they sparred in 2012, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisEubankJr/status/243044944934232064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E243044944934232064&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftalksport.com%2Fsport%2Fboxing%2F492822%2Fjames-degale-vs-chris-eubank-jr-2012-tweet-beef%2F\" title=\"\">Eubank Jr went on Twitter </a>to boast: \u201cToday in sparring I schooled European champ James DeGale. It was the first time I\u2019ve seen a fighter trash talk while getting hit in the face.\u201d Ever since then they have sniped at each other, with DeGale accusing Eubank of being a fraud who lives off his father\u2019s name.</p> <p>Eubank Sr did not always help his son. In 2014 he told me Chris Jr was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/28/chris-eubank-junior-interview-billy-joe-saunders\" title=\"\">the most dangerous man on the planet.\u201d</a> Junior lost his next fight, against Saunders, while hardly throwing a decent punch in the first six rounds. He now has one last chance to match the hype as he is in supreme condition and could outwork DeGale over 12 draining rounds.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who don\u2019t understand fighting think you need to hate somebody to beat them,\u201d Eubank says. \u201cBut I keep hate and anger out of boxing, because it causes mistakes. I\u2019m not going to let the fact that me and James don\u2019t like each other affect me. But I see emotion in James. I\u2019ve definitely got under his skin. He knows he can\u2019t beat me. He knows my determination and focus \u2013 and so he\u2019s going to be very fiery at the start. But, once he realises I\u2019m not going anywhere, he\u2019ll break.\u201d</p> <p>Eubank accepts DeGale operates at a far higher level than any of the men he has beaten. \u201cFor sure. He\u2019s a brilliant fighter. Former world champion, former Olympic gold medallist. I won\u2019t underestimate him.\u201d</p> <p>Eubank exudes an impressive persona but, surely, his two defeats have dented his self-belief? \u201cNo,\u201d he insists. \u201cBoth my losses were on points. I\u2019ve never been knocked out, never had an eight count. Never really been hurt. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/17/george-groves-chris-eubank-jr-fight-report\" title=\"\">I got cut against Groves</a>, and I couldn\u2019t see out of my eye most of the fight but it didn\u2019t hurt. Groves probably weighed 13\u00bd stone whereas I weighed 12. But he never buzzed me. It was just that cut, which looked so bad, with blood everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Eubank pauses. \u201cI\u2019m human. When you lose, of course you\u2019re going to be upset. It\u2019s a horrible feeling. Some fighters lose and their spirits are forever broken. A champion comes back stronger. If you\u2019re constantly dwelling on the past, \u2018I could have done that, I should have done this\u2019, it doesn\u2019t help. You have to look at the situation intellectually and learn from it.\u201d</p> <p>One of the justified criticisms of Eubank is that against Saunders and Groves he did not listen to any advice from his chaotic corner. He argues that now he has a trainer, Nate Vasquez from Floyd Mayweather\u2019s gym in Las Vegas, to whom he will pay attention.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a full-time trainer for the first time and it\u2019s the most focused I\u2019ve ever been.

This will be the first time I\u2019ll be really listening in the corner. That\u2019s why I flew Nate over from Las Vegas. He\u2019s living with me now.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve been around Eubank often enough to know that someone else cluttering up his pristine home could be disastrous. He grins. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy at first but I made my mind up to move forward in my career. Having Nate move in was one of the great challenges as I live alone.</p> <p>\u201cI was thinking: \u2018Is this guy going to be leaving stuff around and making the kitchen untidy? Will I have to threaten to kick him out?\u2019 But he\u2019s been great. Quiet, respectful. Luckily my sparring partner, who\u2019s also living with us, is the same. To have two men living with you is a big shock to the system as I\u2019ve lived alone since I was 19. I\u2019ve had girlfriends throughout the years, staying on and off, but nothing permanent.\u201d</p> <p>Why has Eubank not lived with anyone before? \u201cBoxing is a very tough sport to bring most women into. It\u2019s hard to adjust to the sacrifices. You have to be with somebody that understands, however selfish it sounds, boxing and you come first. My life, my health, my financial stability is on the line every time I step into the ring. It\u2019s hard to put your girlfriend or wife in front of that. Some women expect that in a relationship they should come first. That wouldn\u2019t work for me.</p> <p>\u201cBefore a fight, I go eight weeks without sex. A lot of women can\u2019t handle that. They can\u2019t understand it. My father, who was world champion, told me he had sex until the day before he fought. That blew my mind. I don\u2019t even know if I believe him. I\u2019ve felt the effects of being with a girlfriend before a training session. The next day I felt flat. On the off chance that not having sex for two months is going to help me, I\u2019ll take the off chance.\u201d</p> <p>It sounds as if he finds it difficult to forge a lasting relationship. \u201cI\u2019ve had some mad experiences with the wrong type of person \u2013 men and women. I\u2019ve had guys who said they were my friends but they\u2019re using my name to set up business deals. I\u2019ve had girls that, if not for your name, they\u2019d be with somebody else. I have many acquaintances and just a few real friends. I have the right people around me now.\u201d</p> <p>While his dad drops in twice during this interview to say hello, as Eubank Sr and I go back a long way, since I wrote about him in my book, <a href=\"https://hannibalboxing.com/shop/dark-trade-lost-in-boxing-2/\" title=\"\">Dark Trade</a>, Junior stands alone now. \u201cObviously my father\u2019s mentoring has been invaluable. He will always be a part of my team. But you have to be your own man.\u201d</p> <p>Did his dad, who loves the limelight, accept this decision? \u201cHe had no choice. It\u2019s not that he accepted it. His natural vibe is to be around the people he loves. I\u2019ve never had a problem with it but I\u2019m comfortable in my own skin and sometimes opponents have made him a target in the past. I don\u2019t need to give them that ammunition any more.\u201d</p> <p>Boxing is dangerous enough. Three years ago next month Eubank\u2019s fists did so much damage Nick Blackwell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/27/nick-blackwell-in-coma-title-fight-defeat-chris-eubank-jr\" title=\"\">ended up in a coma.</a> \u201cIt was hard,\u201d Eubank says, his face clouding. \u201cEnding someone\u2019s career, knowing they were seriously injured, was tough. That\u2019s not the goal \u2013 to hospitalise your opponent. You want to knock him down but you want him to get up after the count is over. You want him to go back safely to his family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc9c5fd1c802a12c6b479b4d8853fa950d5bddca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc9c5fd1c802a12c6b479b4d8853fa950d5bddca/56_52_2941_1766/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Eubank Jr wants to keep fighting into next year and is not underestimating the importance of avoiding defeat at the 02.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Eubank Jr wants to keep fighting into next year and is not underestimating the importance of avoiding defeat at the 02.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou read about fighters who lose their lives \u2013 or get critically injured.

You have to believe you\u2019re going to be OK, that you\u2019re going to win. James has branded this a retirement fight but if I have my way I\u2019m going to be out here until I\u2019m 34. I love the fighting and entertaining. I\u2019ll do it as long as I can. And, when it\u2019s over, it\u2019s going to be very painful.\u201d</p> <p>Eubank looks up just days from a fight that might end his career or lift him on to a path of new respect. \u201cNothing gives you this intensity. No drug, no alcohol, no woman, can match the feeling of having your hand raised after a fight. It would be hard for any fighter to give up but that day has not entered my mind. There\u2019s so much more I want to achieve. But, first, I have to win this fight. It\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cThis is the biggest and most important fight of my career,\u201d Chris Eubank Jr says quietly, rocking gently on a plastic chair in a tiny office tucked away in his gym on Hove seafront. He nods intently as he considers his battle against James DeGale at the O2 in London on Saturday night. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the one where I have the most to lose. A loss would leave me in no man\u2019s land. DeGale is in exactly the same position. We both cannot afford defeat. We\u2019re both on the edge and someone\u2019s going to fall.\u201d I have asked just one opening question and Eubank has cut to the heart. He and DeGale are preparing for a bout which will surely leave the loser facing the end of his career. Of course this is boxing and so a controversial decision or a narrow defeat might persuade the defeated fighter that one last shot at redemption is possible. But both men recognise their future, and long-term reputations, could be decided this weekend. DeGale has been around boxing so long, as an Olympic gold medallist and a two-times IBF super-middleweight champion, it\u2019s surprising to think he has had one fight fewer than Eubank, whose record is 27-2. At 33, DeGale has achieved far more but he has also been through more wars. Talk of his retirement is a recurring theme. Eubank, who is 29, has much more to prove as he lost to the two world-class operators he has faced in Billy Joe Saunders and George Groves. DeGale also lost to Groves, his bitter rival, but went on an unbeaten run that lasted six-and-a-half years before he dropped a shock decision to Caleb Truax. That loss was avenged last April but DeGale has been ravaged by injury and weariness. He is more skilful than Eubank but the younger man is desperate for the big win that would move him beyond the shadow of his father, Chris Sr, who was such a powerful if eccentric presence in the 1990s. This contest also carries some spite. After they sparred in 2012, Eubank Jr went on Twitter to boast: \u201cToday in sparring I schooled European champ James DeGale. It was the first time I\u2019ve seen a fighter trash talk while getting hit in the face.\u201d Ever since then they have sniped at each other, with DeGale accusing Eubank of being a fraud who lives off his father\u2019s name. Eubank Sr did not always help his son. In 2014 he told me Chris Jr was \u201cthe most dangerous man on the planet.\u201d Junior lost his next fight, against Saunders, while hardly throwing a decent punch in the first six rounds. He now has one last chance to match the hype as he is in supreme condition and could outwork DeGale over 12 draining rounds. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t understand fighting think you need to hate somebody to beat them,\u201d Eubank says. \u201cBut I keep hate and anger out of boxing, because it causes mistakes. I\u2019m not going to let the fact that me and James don\u2019t like each other affect me. But I see emotion in James. I\u2019ve definitely got under his skin. He knows he can\u2019t beat me. He knows my determination and focus \u2013 and so he\u2019s going to be very fiery at the start. But, once he realises I\u2019m not going anywhere, he\u2019ll break.\u201d Eubank accepts DeGale operates at a far higher level than any of the men he has beaten. \u201cFor sure. He\u2019s a brilliant fighter. Former world champion, former Olympic gold medallist. I won\u2019t underestimate him.\u201d Eubank exudes an impressive persona but, surely, his two defeats have dented his self-belief? \u201cNo,\u201d he insists. \u201cBoth my losses were on points. I\u2019ve never been knocked out, never had an eight count. Never really been hurt. I got cut against Groves, and I couldn\u2019t see out of my eye most of the fight but it didn\u2019t hurt. Groves probably weighed 13\u00bd stone whereas I weighed 12. But he never buzzed me. It was just that cut, which looked so bad, with blood everywhere.\u201d Eubank pauses. \u201cI\u2019m human. When you lose, of course you\u2019re going to be upset. It\u2019s a horrible feeling. Some fighters lose and their spirits are forever broken. A champion comes back stronger.

Instead, what follows as the rapper bounds on stage, dressed in black, glugging from a red cup, is a perfunctory pop-rap spectacle that sees him thunder through country-infused hits from his two studio albums. Broken Whiskey Glass, from his debut Stoney, provides a Morricone-style cinematic opener, full of epic strings and cawing vulture noises. Outings for Psycho, the new single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0i23wZ0IeE\">Wow</a> and White Iverson \u2013 the airy blend of synths and 808 bass that put Malone on the music industry\u2019s radar in 2015 \u2013 arrive soon after, before the star grabs an acoustic guitar for a stripped-down rendition of campfire singalong Stay.</p> <p>It\u2019s the more unabashedly pop moments like this that find Malone at his most natural, with the most to say. While trappy tracks such as No Option struggle to offer much beyond Mercedes-Benz brags and cliches about watches and women, bellowed anthems such as Better Now pull you inside fractured relationships and his even more fractured psyche, dousing fans with angst, emotion and impressive vocals. Sunflower, by contrast \u2013 his deliriously catchy theme song to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/28/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-review-a-dazzling-animated-caper\">Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</a> \u2013 is a candy-coloured melodic tumble as vivid as the blockbuster it accompanied.</p> <p>\u201cYou can be an astronaut, a heart surgeon, whatever you want,\u201d he tells the crowd before the closer, Congratulations. Malone sometimes sounds as if he hasn\u2019t yet worked out what he wants to be himself. Though his genre-hopping, drawing on emo and Americana as well as Atlanta hip-hop, has undoubtedly helped boost <a href=\"https://www.rap-up.com/2017/10/11/post-malone-most-streamed-artist-in-the-world/\">his success in the streaming era</a> (he has a song for every Spotify playlist imaginable), the result is sometimes unfocused and jarring. You also realise that while controversy might follow Malone, unlike the last arena-entertaining white rapper before him, Eminem, it\u2019s seldom his music that offends. Controversies such as the Savage saga are byproducts of the awkward intersection between musical cultures in which he exists.</p> <p>Maybe it\u2019s silly to expect Malone to shout out Savage, to acknowledge challenges facing those from the rap world whose sound and style he mines. After all, bowing out as a blaze of pyrotechnics erupt around him, Malone isn\u2019t really a rap artist, or even the rockstar he proclaimed himself on his breakout hit. He\u2019s a pop star, nothing more, nothing less.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://www.manchester-arena.com/events/post-malone/9415/\">Manchester Arena</a>, 19 February. <a href=\"http://www.postmalone.com/tour\">Then touring</a>.</p>",

While trappy tracks such as No Option struggle to offer much beyond Mercedes-Benz brags and cliches about watches and women, bellowed anthems such as Better Now pull you inside fractured relationships and his even more fractured psyche, dousing fans with angst, emotion and impressive vocals. Sunflower, by contrast \u2013 his deliriously catchy theme song to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse \u2013 is a candy-coloured melodic tumble as vivid as the blockbuster it accompanied. \u201cYou can be an astronaut, a heart surgeon, whatever you want,\u201d he tells the crowd before the closer, Congratulations. Malone sometimes sounds as if he hasn\u2019t yet worked out what he wants to be himself. Though his genre-hopping, drawing on emo and Americana as well as Atlanta hip-hop, has undoubtedly helped boost his success in the streaming era (he has a song for every Spotify playlist imaginable), the result is sometimes unfocused and jarring. You also realise that while controversy might follow Malone, unlike the last arena-entertaining white rapper before him, Eminem, it\u2019s seldom his music that offends. Controversies such as the Savage saga are byproducts of the awkward intersection between musical cultures in which he exists. Maybe it\u2019s silly to expect Malone to shout out Savage, to acknowledge challenges facing those from the rap world whose sound and style he mines. After all, bowing out as a blaze of pyrotechnics erupt around him, Malone isn\u2019t really a rap artist, or even the rockstar he proclaimed himself on his breakout hit. He\u2019s a pop star, nothing more, nothing less. \u2022 At Manchester Arena, 19 February. Then touring.",

For years we\u2019ve been locked in an angry tug of war, and this is where it\u2019s brought us. And at a time when poverty, homelessness, mental ill health and crumbling public services have pushed thousands to breaking point. People have never needed us more.</p> \n<p>For 126 years our strength has been in the diversity of a movement that inspires fierce debate across the grassroots and the highest levels. Our breadth gives us reach into very different communities and the ability to hear what they are telling us. At times we have fallen short, but, at our best, we inspire people to debate, argue and participate. Even through the Iraq war years we were home to politicians as diverse as Jeremy Corbyn and Tony Blair. Dissenting politicians have found ways to stand by Labour values even in such fraught times.</p> \n<p>The MPs who left today have different motives and beliefs. Some never accepted the current leader, others served in his shadow cabinet. But a response to this that seeks to attack and condemn speaks of an unwillingness to listen, learn or compromise. We are in danger of becoming incapable of accommodating alternative points of view.</p> \n<p>Growing intolerance has spread like a cancer across the political spectrum, but its existence in the Labour party is a genuine threat to our survival. Our members join the party to fight for a more compassionate, equal and tolerant country. How do we convince the public we can create that country if we don\u2019t live, fight for and uphold those values ourselves?</p> \n<p>There is strength in humility, generosity and compassion. As the Brexit deadline looms and we face a looming national crisis, we will not be forgiven for spending more time looking inwards. The blame game that has erupted is a hopeless dead end for us and for the country.

Splits have been mooted since the very advent of Corbynism, especially since the second leadership election put paid to the idea that the route back to rule for Continuity Blairities was via the membership. The general election in 2017 returned a far greater turnout for Labour than MPs like Chris Leslie and Chuka Umunna had mooted, and seemed to temporarily quell attempts to restart a leadership contest.</p> \n<p>But as Monday\u2019s press conference shows, the philosophical tussle remains at the heart of the party, but it is less concerned with what the future of Labour should be than how politics itself should function. Labour has always been a broad church: it held John McDonnell, Jeremy Corbyn and many other socialist members of the Labour Representation Committee within its ranks while voting for war in Iraq, and letting private finance initiatives overtake hospitals. Those tensions have always bubbled up: these seven MPs are now discovering how it feels to be sidelined and consigned to the backbench.</p> \n<p>Their decision to start their own splinter group is a refusal to accept that role. They won\u2019t see any more decision-making ability \u2013 that\u2019s not the aim \u2013 but they hope to grab as many headlines as possible. In breaking away, they accept the fact that doing so jeopardises a potential Labour government: numbers are tight, regardless, and pulling a handful of MPs away is designed to either block a Labour government, and lead to decades of Conservative rule, or secure a confidence-and-supply deal akin to that enjoyed by the Democratic Unionist party, and greater influence as a result.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/18/several-labour-mps-set-to-quit-the-party-politics-live\">Labour split: seven MPs resign from the party \u2013 Politics live</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Real, transformative social change in the first-past-the-post system requires a majority government.

If Coffey, Smith, Gapes et al had the courage of their convictions and were truly honest about their aims, they would stand for their seats in by-elections: winning would send a clear message to Corbyn and McDonnell that they have their constituents\u2019 backing.</p> \n<p>But they will not: this is a vanity exercise, and the most high-profile example of political toys being thrown from the pram yet.

We are completely stuck. The two-party system strangles any innovation at birth. It has calcified in the last few years into total crisis. Representative democracy is not working in any meaningful way. We sit agog as deals are done, bungs offered and amendments made. Both main parties are in hock to their extremists and to unelected advisors, from Lynton Crosby to Seumas Milne.</p> \n<p>Those who can watch a heavily pregnant Jewish woman saying that she has been bullied out of the Labour party, that this party is institutionally racist, and think nothing of it \u2013 all while she is being abused right now on social media \u2013 need to take a long, hard look themselves. Don\u2019t bleat on about the moral integrity of some future socialism when this is what\u2019s happening now. </p> \n<p>Antisemitism and the leadership\u2019s position on Russia and Venezuela are not uppermost on the doorstep. Not even Brexit is. It\u2019s housing, jobs and hospitals \u2013 all of which are good reason to want a Labour government. But at what price? Sometimes you have to ask who your fellow travellers are, and what they are asking you to go along with. We can all spout on about ending neoliberalism. It\u2019s harder to understand how Labour might end the barrage of abuse its women and Jewish MPs face.</p> \n<p>The viciousness of attacks on anyone who doesn\u2019t worship Corbyn, this continued cry of \u201ccentrist\u201d as a meaningless insult, the personal attacks on this gang of seven: all that is but babble to the average voter. The repeated comparison to the SDP seems meaningless. That was a long time ago and we are in a vastly different era. Blame will now be apportioned \u2013 whether the idea is to set up a new party, join with rogue Tories, or not. The point is to be true to oneself. Right now, many MPs cannot say they are. They are huddling together like penguins in the frozen Antarctic hoping for the weather to change. They are inert, powerless and unhappy.</p> \n<p>It may be old-fashioned to want our politicians to stick to their beliefs, but then I am old-fashioned. If people standing up for what they believe is now seen as sad and disloyal, as both a power grab and a damp squib, then Labour needs to look at itself. A broken system cannot be fixed by those who keep their heads down.

That 38,000 figure is itself 12,000 greater than in 2015: and those extra voters can be attributed directly to the Corbyn effect \u2013 the impact of the Labour leader Umunna has always opposed, yet who galvanised support and won an extra 3.5m votes across the country within two years of taking office.</p> \n<p>Umunna talked of intolerance within the party, bringing up his own his Irish-Nigerian heritage. Yet it\u2019s Corbyn who has brought minorities into his frontbench in unprecedented numbers \u2013 the New Labour years by contrast were conspicuous by their whiteness. (Ironically, though the party was far more institutionally racist in those days, Umunna, who\u2019s so quick to attack Corbyn on this, barely raised a murmur against Blair, Brown or Miliband). And Corbyn, who has always embraced multicultural Britain, won massive support among black and Asian voters in 2017, including many in Streatham.</p> \n<p>Umunna is entitled to leave the party: it\u2019s become clearer over time that his views are increasingly out of step with modern voters \u2013 his cosying up to the wealthy, and his non-opposition to austerity were not in line with the direction Labour\u2019s leadership was taking. I\u2019d rather Umunna stayed in the party; even better, I\u2019d rather he realised how out of touch he\u2019s become and start to represent his constituents and party members better.

      "bodyText": "Lisa Nandy: Labour\u2019s growing intolerance is a threat to its survival This is the saddest of days for the Labour party and everyone who needs us. For years we\u2019ve been locked in an angry tug of war, and this is where it\u2019s brought us. And at a time when poverty, homelessness, mental ill health and crumbling public services have pushed thousands to breaking point. People have never needed us more. For 126 years our strength has been in the diversity of a movement that inspires fierce debate across the grassroots and the highest levels. Our breadth gives us reach into very different communities and the ability to hear what they are telling us. At times we have fallen short, but, at our best, we inspire people to debate, argue and participate. Even through the Iraq war years we were home to politicians as diverse as Jeremy Corbyn and Tony Blair. Dissenting politicians have found ways to stand by Labour values even in such fraught times. The MPs who left today have different motives and beliefs. Some never accepted the current leader, others served in his shadow cabinet. But a response to this that seeks to attack and condemn speaks of an unwillingness to listen, learn or compromise. We are in danger of becoming incapable of accommodating alternative points of view. Growing intolerance has spread like a cancer across the political spectrum, but its existence in the Labour party is a genuine threat to our survival. Our members join the party to fight for a more compassionate, equal and tolerant country. How do we convince the public we can create that country if we don\u2019t live, fight for and uphold those values ourselves? There is strength in humility, generosity and compassion. As the Brexit deadline looms and we face a looming national crisis, we will not be forgiven for spending more time looking inwards. The blame game that has erupted is a hopeless dead end for us and for the country. We have to do better. \u2022 Lisa Nandy is Labour MP for Wigan Dawn Foster: This is a vanity exercise A rushed press conference, a lineup that surprised no one, and a name and branding exercise that promises not to bother so much as the third page of Google. Splits have been mooted since the very advent of Corbynism, especially since the second leadership election put paid to the idea that the route back to rule for Continuity Blairities was via the membership. The general election in 2017 returned a far greater turnout for Labour than MPs like Chris Leslie and Chuka Umunna had mooted, and seemed to temporarily quell attempts to restart a leadership contest. But as Monday\u2019s press conference shows, the philosophical tussle remains at the heart of the party, but it is less concerned with what the future of Labour should be than how politics itself should function. Labour has always been a broad church: it held John McDonnell, Jeremy Corbyn and many other socialist members of the Labour Representation Committee within its ranks while voting for war in Iraq, and letting private finance initiatives overtake hospitals. Those tensions have always bubbled up: these seven MPs are now discovering how it feels to be sidelined and consigned to the backbench. Their decision to start their own splinter group is a refusal to accept that role. They won\u2019t see any more decision-making ability \u2013 that\u2019s not the aim \u2013 but they hope to grab as many headlines as possible. In breaking away, they accept the fact that doing so jeopardises a potential Labour government: numbers are tight, regardless, and pulling a handful of MPs away is designed to either block a Labour government, and lead to decades of Conservative rule, or secure a confidence-and-supply deal akin to that enjoyed by the Democratic Unionist party, and greater influence as a result. Real, transformative social change in the first-past-the-post system requires a majority government. The breakaway seven today have publicly made clear they are willing to see a continuation of deliberate poverty, benefit sanctions, the cruelty of universal credit, and economic mismanagement, rather than accept politics has changed and the terms in which they entered parliament have altered. If Coffey, Smith, Gapes et al had the courage of their convictions and were truly honest about their aims, they would stand for their seats in by-elections: winning would send a clear message to Corbyn and McDonnell that they have their constituents\u2019 backing. But they will not: this is a vanity exercise, and the most high-profile example of political toys being thrown from the pram yet. Many MPs will be watching this spectacle and staunchly steering clear. \u2022 Dawn Foster is a Guardian columnist Suzanne Moore: A dose of hard and necessary truth for Labour Politics is broken, we all know that. We are completely stuck. The two-party system strangles any innovation at birth. It has calcified in the last few years into total crisis. Representative democracy is not working in any meaningful way. We sit agog as deals are done, bungs offered and amendments made. Both main parties are in hock to their extremists and to unelected advisors, from Lynton Crosby to Seumas Milne. Those who can watch a heavily pregnant Jewish woman saying that she has been bullied out of the Labour party, that this party is institutionally racist, and think nothing of it \u2013 all while she is being abused right now on social media \u2013 need to take a long, hard look themselves. Don\u2019t bleat on about the moral integrity of some future socialism when this is what\u2019s happening now. Antisemitism and the leadership\u2019s position on Russia and Venezuela are not uppermost on the doorstep. Not even Brexit is. It\u2019s housing, jobs and hospitals \u2013 all of which are good reason to want a Labour government. But at what price? Sometimes you have to ask who your fellow travellers are, and what they are asking you to go along with. We can all spout on about ending neoliberalism. It\u2019s harder to understand how Labour might end the barrage of abuse its women and Jewish MPs face. The viciousness of attacks on anyone who doesn\u2019t worship Corbyn, this continued cry of \u201ccentrist\u201d as a meaningless insult, the personal attacks on this gang of seven: all that is but babble to the average voter. The repeated comparison to the SDP seems meaningless. That was a long time ago and we are in a vastly different era. Blame will now be apportioned \u2013 whether the idea is to set up a new party, join with rogue Tories, or not. The point is to be true to oneself. Right now, many MPs cannot say they are. They are huddling together like penguins in the frozen Antarctic hoping for the weather to change. They are inert, powerless and unhappy. It may be old-fashioned to want our politicians to stick to their beliefs, but then I am old-fashioned. If people standing up for what they believe is now seen as sad and disloyal, as both a power grab and a damp squib, then Labour needs to look at itself. A broken system cannot be fixed by those who keep their heads down. I saw that some hard and necessary truth was spoken on Monday, and if that can\u2019t be tolerated, or even listened to, that tells us all we need to know. \u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist Joseph Harker: If the seven really believe in what they\u2019re saying, they should let voters decide I have been disenfranchised. My Labour MP, Chuka Umunna, who represents the Streatham constituency, and whom I and 38,000 others voted for less than two years ago, has quit the party and set up in centrist alliance with six others.

      "body": "<p>After Christmas and new year, and three large batches of braised red cabbage, a disproportionate amount of which \u2013 due to greed and responsibility \u2013 I ate, I swore never to cook or eat red cabbage again. How quickly I forget. A month later and I am in the supermarket, quite literally weighing up two bald heads of cabbage, deep purple and polished, each with a bulging vein-like rib curving down one side. It is a cliche I know, but nevertheless true, that many Italians \u2013 especially those over 50 from Rome and southwards \u2013 find it impossible not to comment on young children, damp hair and food shopping, especially if you are standing with hands like a weighing scale looking indecisive.</p> <p>\u201c<em>Questo</em>\u201d (\u201cthat one\u201d), said a smart 50-something man in a green puffy gilet and jaunty scarf, choosing carrots as if something of upmost importance depended on it. He then went on to tell me he couldn\u2019t eat red cabbage because it gave him terrible and painful wind, and that cooking it makes the house smell.</p> <p>\u201cWe missed the last train, and couldn\u2019t find a cab, and of course Mr Davidson, who thought he knew everything, wandered down the wrong street, and we were suddenly overcome by a ghastly odour,\u201d Mrs Davidson tells MFK Fisher, who recounts the story in her essay The Social Status of a Vegetable. \u201cA dreadful odour,\u201d Mrs D continues, \u201cso terrible that I was almost swooning. I pressed my muff against my face, and we stumbled on, gasping ... it was cabbage cooking.\u201d</p> <p>Considering that Mrs Davidson was already old and stiff when Fisher wrote in the 1930s, there is no danger of her wandering under my window. Good job too, because if she did, or the man in the green gilet does, there is a high probability they would get a noseful of cabbage, from either the tavola calda underneath my flat, the trattoria beside it, or our stove. I have long since given up worrying. I just add to the general waves of sulphur that are as much a part of Rome as cobblestones, mustard-yellow buildings and football-related graffiti.</p> <p>Before we get to the cooking, though, there is a way to eat cabbage without the pong: don\u2019t cook it. As well as being the Dorian Gray of the vegetable drawer, seemingly immune to the ravages of ageing, red cabbage is also a vegetable of extremes: don\u2019t cook it, or cook it a lot \u2013 there is nothing in between.</p> <p>Having chosen \u2013 with help \u2013 a cabbage, I decided it would be both nothing <em>and</em> all. Half became a salad, with fennel, carrot and apple, all chopped as thinly as paper pushed through a shredder, then tossed with mandarin juice, lemon olive oil and caper dressing. A decisive and bright slaw served at once, and different but good the next day when it is a carefree slump.</p> <p>The second half became soup \u2013 the inspiration for which came from Marcella Hazan and an Italian writer called Martino Ragusa, and from the mountain soups from Novara, the easternmost province of Piedmont.

      "bodyText": "After Christmas and new year, and three large batches of braised red cabbage, a disproportionate amount of which \u2013 due to greed and responsibility \u2013 I ate, I swore never to cook or eat red cabbage again. How quickly I forget. A month later and I am in the supermarket, quite literally weighing up two bald heads of cabbage, deep purple and polished, each with a bulging vein-like rib curving down one side. It is a cliche I know, but nevertheless true, that many Italians \u2013 especially those over 50 from Rome and southwards \u2013 find it impossible not to comment on young children, damp hair and food shopping, especially if you are standing with hands like a weighing scale looking indecisive. \u201cQuesto\u201d (\u201cthat one\u201d), said a smart 50-something man in a green puffy gilet and jaunty scarf, choosing carrots as if something of upmost importance depended on it. He then went on to tell me he couldn\u2019t eat red cabbage because it gave him terrible and painful wind, and that cooking it makes the house smell. \u201cWe missed the last train, and couldn\u2019t find a cab, and of course Mr Davidson, who thought he knew everything, wandered down the wrong street, and we were suddenly overcome by a ghastly odour,\u201d Mrs Davidson tells MFK Fisher, who recounts the story in her essay The Social Status of a Vegetable. \u201cA dreadful odour,\u201d Mrs D continues, \u201cso terrible that I was almost swooning. I pressed my muff against my face, and we stumbled on, gasping ... it was cabbage cooking.\u201d Considering that Mrs Davidson was already old and stiff when Fisher wrote in the 1930s, there is no danger of her wandering under my window. Good job too, because if she did, or the man in the green gilet does, there is a high probability they would get a noseful of cabbage, from either the tavola calda underneath my flat, the trattoria beside it, or our stove. I have long since given up worrying. I just add to the general waves of sulphur that are as much a part of Rome as cobblestones, mustard-yellow buildings and football-related graffiti. Before we get to the cooking, though, there is a way to eat cabbage without the pong: don\u2019t cook it. As well as being the Dorian Gray of the vegetable drawer, seemingly immune to the ravages of ageing, red cabbage is also a vegetable of extremes: don\u2019t cook it, or cook it a lot \u2013 there is nothing in between. Having chosen \u2013 with help \u2013 a cabbage, I decided it would be both nothing and all. Half became a salad, with fennel, carrot and apple, all chopped as thinly as paper pushed through a shredder, then tossed with mandarin juice, lemon olive oil and caper dressing. A decisive and bright slaw served at once, and different but good the next day when it is a carefree slump. The second half became soup \u2013 the inspiration for which came from Marcella Hazan and an Italian writer called Martino Ragusa, and from the mountain soups from Novara, the easternmost province of Piedmont. These are soups that are \u201call\u201d in every sense of the word \u2013 not just for the long cooking of the cabbage, which renders it soft, sweet-savoury and full of flavour, but also in terms of ingredients and multiple layers. Some recipes suggest the addition of pork rind and hock, cabbage and beef stock, sausages, beans, and three days of cooking. My version is tamer, although still burly: a diced onion and 50g of pancetta cooked in olive oil, half a shredded cabbage added, along with a glass of red wine, a tin of plum tomatoes and a litre of water or stock. Low and slow, the soup needs two hours, and in the last 15 minutes you add two tins of beans \u2013 one pur\u00e9ed, one whole \u2013 and three sausages you have crumbled and fried in a separate pan. Finish the deep-purple, spoon-supporting soup with a sprig of rosemary and few sage leaves fried in olive oil \u2013 just tip it in. As with the endless braised red cabbage of Christmas, this soup is unquestionably better the next day \u2013 ideally a cold and hungry day, when it seems the most satisfying thing in the world, soul-staying, mountain-conquering and so madly, deeply purple. If you are worried about it discolouring, add a spoonful of vinegar, which works well against the other flavours. If you are worried about smells or wind, both of which play a much more significant role in food, and therefore life, than food writers usually care to mention, maybe the salad is a better bet. Red cabbage, sausage and white bean soup Prep 10 min Cook 2 hr Serves 6 50g pancetta, diced 4 tbsp olive oil 1 medium onion, peeled and chopped 1 stick celery, chopped 1 garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped Half a medium red cabbage, shredded 1 glass red wine 1 tin plum tomatoes, chopped 1 litre water or pork stock 3 pork sausages 2 tins cannellini beans, drained Salt and black pepper To serve Extra-virgin olive oil 1 sprig rosemary 5 sage leaves In a large, heavy-based pan, fry the pancetta in the olive oil. After a minute or so, add the onion, and celery and fry until the onion is translucent. Add the garlic and cook for a minute, then add the red cabbage and stir until it glistens with oil. Raise the heat a bit, add the wine, then, after a few minutes, the tomatoes and water. Bring to the boil, reduce to a simmer, cover and cook for two hours. In the last 20 minutes, remove the casing from the sausage, crumble the meat into a frying pan, and fry until browned \u2013 about five minutes. Once brown, add to the meat to the soup, along with the beans \u2013 pur\u00e9e half the beans if you wish. Simmer for the final 15 minutes, adding salt and pepper as needed. If you like, finish by frying the rosemary and sage in some olive oil and adding these to the soup.",

Two weeks into the trip, a teenage boy was brought in with a metal fragment in his abdomen, sustained from one of the mortars that had been raining down on the city for days. He was anaesthetised and taken to an operating theatre where Nott set about opening his abdomen to inspect the damage. After making the incision, he heard an enormous crash and the lights went out. The hospital had taken a direct hit, leaving him in the dark trying to stem the bleeding by squeezing the boy\u2019s aorta while pressing down on a swab. When the lights eventually flickered back on, Nott realised he was all alone. The rest of the team \u2013 an anaesthetist, a scrub nurse and an assistant \u2013 had fled the room and taken cover in the basement. The boy, meanwhile, had died.</p> <p>In <em>War Doctor</em>, Nott\u2019s account of 25 years dispensing life-saving treatment in some of the most dangerous places in the world, he describes his fury at having been abandoned, though later he comes to understand his colleagues\u2019 actions. \u201cThis experience taught me two things,\u201d he explains. \u201cFirst, I\u2019d have to toughen up; second, I also had to take care of myself. Not just because there was no one else there who was going to do that for me, but because I wouldn\u2019t be helping anyone if I was dead.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re hardly short of books by doctors describing difficult work carried out in straitened circumstances \u2013 think Rachel Clarke\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/03/rachel-clarke-your-life-in-my-hands-interview\" title=\"\"><em>Your Life in My Hands</em></a> or Adam Kay\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/04/this-is-going-to-hurt-secret-diaries-of-a-junior-doctor-by-adam-kay-review\" title=\"\"><em>This Is Going to Hurt</em> </a>\u2013 but Nott\u2019s is something else entirely. Where most people strive to avoid trouble, he actively goes in search of it. \u201cIt is a kind of addiction,\u201d he says in the prologue, \u201ca pull I find hard to resist.\u201d His stories of courage and compassion in the face of seemingly certain death are breathtaking. There\u2019s the time, for instance, that Syrian jihadis stormed the makeshift hospital in which he was working after spotting him on the roof with a camera. Assuming he was photographing their movements, they were poised to drag him away but were persuaded not to on realising that the camera contained pictures of sunsets. Or there\u2019s the moment he and his head nurse were driven to meet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/30/mullah-omar\" title=\"\">Mullah Omar</a>, the feared Taliban leader, to secure permission to operate on a young Afghan woman who was haemorrhaging after childbirth. \u201cHis manner was serene, almost statesman-like,\u201d Nott recalls. \u201cI think just to get rid of us, he agreed to our request.\u201d</p> <p>His reflections on why he does what he does are compelling in a different way. Why would he so willingly put himself in the path of danger? Part of it, he says, is altruism \u2013 a simple desire to save lives and put his skills in general and vascular surgery to the best possible use. However, his first trip to Sarajevo reveals another reason. There, while travelling with a patient in an ambulance across the city, the vehicle was targeted by a sniper. Nott, the patient and the driver survived but the porter travelling with them died from bullet wounds to the chest, neck and face. Nott describes how his shock at the attack was followed by relief at having escaped death. But then he observes another feeling: \u201cI felt elated, exhilarated, euphoric.

The actor responded by questioning whether the president\u2019s words represented \u201ca threat to my safety and that of my family\u201d. Baldwin reprised his role as Donald Trump with blonde wig, characteristic pout and exaggerated imitation of the president\u2019s speech-making style, for the show\u2019s cold open on Saturday. This time the sketch parodied the president\u2019s press conference in which he announced a national emergency over his plans to build a border wall with Mexico. \u201cWe need wall. We have a tremendous amount of drugs coming in through the southern border, or the \u2018brown line\u2019 as many people have asked me not to call it,\u201d said Baldwin. \u201cYou all see why I gotta fake this emergency, right? I have to because I want to. It\u2019s really simple. We have a problem. Drugs are coming into this country through no wall. \u201cWall works, wall makes safe. You don\u2019t have to be smart to understand that \u2013 in fact it\u2019s even easier to understand if you\u2019re not that smart.\u201d The president, who has proven very sensitive to the way he is covered in the media, was clearly unimpressed with Baldwin\u2019s characterisation, saying on Twitter there was \u201cnothing funny about tired Saturday Night Live on Fake News NBC!\u201d The president asked how the networks got away with shows like this \u201cwithout retribution \u2026 very unfair and should be looked into\u201d. In characteristic capitals, he added: \u201cTHE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDIA IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!\u201d Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration is expected to face challenges \u2013 a topic also seized on by Baldwin. \u201cI\u2019ll immediately be sued and the ruling will not go in my favour and then it will end up in the supreme court and then I\u2019ll call my buddy Kavanaugh and I\u2019ll say \u2018It\u2019s time to repay the Donny\u2019 and he\u2019ll say, \u2018New phone, who dis?\u2019 And by then the Mueller report will be released, crumbling my house of cards and I can plead insanity and do a few months in the puzzle factory and my personal hell of playing president will finally be over.\u201d Trump\u2019s talk of \u201cretribution\u201d drew criticism, with lawmakers and journalists suggesting the threats violated core democratic principles.

      "bodyText": "The barrister Joanna Hardy took to Twitter to highlight sexism in the legal profession last week. In one of her tweets, she wrote: \u201cIf you\u2019re a male in a male-heavy case, don\u2019t ask the female counsel to fetch the coffee/pour your water. Try to remember their names. Don\u2019t make repetitive jokes about breasts or skirts. Don\u2019t communicate solely in innuendo.\u201d It is a sad state of affairs that in the more than 100 years since women have practised law, we still remain marginalised in the senior rankings of the profession, and sexism is endemic. While gender inequality in the legal profession is rightly making headlines, there are other intersectional patterns of inequality, such as class and race, that rarely garner as much attention when they should be at the forefront of the fight for equality. When I talk about equality, I mean overhauling the legal profession so that the law reflects the society it represents: people from all walks of life. I know better than most that the legal profession is inherently sexist. As a junior barrister I have spoken publicly about sexual harassment. In 2015, I hit the headlines after tweeting a message sent by a senior solicitor (twice my age) on LinkedIn in which he referred to my photograph as \u201cstunning\u201d while ignoring my professional skills. I continue to hear complaints from colleagues who have been the butt of lewd sexual jokes in the robing room or who have been bullied by male judges who have an issue with women. A colleague was asked to tie back her hair as her flowing locks were a distraction for one male judge. Lady Arden, the third woman to be appointed to the supreme court, recently revealed how she was advised not to pursue a career at the bar on account of her being a woman \u2013 regardless, she pursued her ambition and became one of the first two women to take silk. The #MeToo movement has failed to put even a dint in the structures of power in the legal profession. A recent survey by Legal Week showed that 64% of women in law firms had experienced sexual harassment at work. In law, power is concentrated in the hands of the few, mainly white, privileged men who remain unscathed from outside noise. Men make up 71% of partners of large law firms, 85% of silks and 72% of the judiciary. The figures alone show that meritocracy is a myth. Despite the fact that privilege and inequality go hand in hand, class is not a protected characteristic under the Equality Act. The legal profession remains effectively closed to those from poorer backgrounds: 22% of solicitors attended a fee-paying school, and the cost of attending law school is prohibitively expensive (bar school costs more than \u00a318,000), which puts people from less affluent backgrounds out of the race. I went to a local comprehensive school in the Midlands, where the kids laughed when I said I wanted to be a lawyer. I attended a university that virtually no one has heard of \u2013 Keele. But I had never experienced the north-south divide quite so viscerally as when I started bar school in London. I was told by one male barrister that I would never make it, while others mansplained pronunciation to me, attempting to tone down my brash accent. Such comments reinforce an outsider status in a profession that should be open to everyone. Race has long been an issue in the legal profession. Black, Asian and minority ethnic individuals make up just 8% of partners of large law firms, 8% of judges and only 7.2% of those in silk . This does not fairly represent the BAME population in the UK of about 13%. This under-representation throughout the legal profession can lead to systematic racism. The first black woman to be made a high court judge was appointed, shamefully, only 15 years ago. Dame Linda Dobbs has spoken about her experiences of racism and sexism, ranging from briefs being passed to male barristers because of her inferior gendered status or being instructed in cases because her status as a black minority would help the case. I have long been a supporter of quotas for women from all backgrounds because I want to see equality in my lifetime. History shows that powerful men won\u2019t give up their seat at the table unless they are made to make way for women. Mentorship schemes and scholarships for people from less affluent backgrounds are essential to ensuring access to the profession. I had a supportive mentor and I was awarded a scholarship, all of which helped me make it to the bar.

The political consensus on aid, which has lasted two decades and led to Britain becoming a world leader in aid and development, has fallen apart.</p> <p>The current international development secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jan/30/penny-mordaunt-criticised-over-call-for-aid-to-come-from-private-sector\" title=\"\">Penny Mordaunt</a>, delivered a presentation proposing a series of radical changes to the way Britain delivers aid, and how much we spend on it. She floated the idea that not all of the money should come from taxpayers (some could come from companies or philanthropists, she said), and proposed spending some of the department\u2019s budget on peacekeeping. In other words, aid money would be spent on deploying British troops.</p> <p> Mordaunt is not the only Conservative with the aid budget in their sights. Jacob Rees-Mogg has long campaigned for it to be slashed, while the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/10/boris-johnson-backs-call-for-multibillion-cut-to-uk-aid-budget\" title=\"\">renewed his call</a> to scrap the Department for International Development (DfID) and bring aid and development funding back into the Foreign Office, two decades after the Labour government spun it off.</p> <p>It\u2019s notable that aid\u2019s biggest critics are also Brexiteers \u2013 and not just in parliament. The most prominent outriders for a cut to the aid budget \u2013 newspapers such as the Sun, Daily Mail and the Express, and opaque lobby groups such as the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance and the Institute of Economic Affairs \u2013 are also Brexit\u2019s loudest cheerleaders. That\u2019s no coincidence: a form of nationalism, particularly the idea of a generous Britain being taken for a ride by foreigners, fuels both campaigns.</p> <p>The idea of rich nations spending 0.7% of GDP on international aid sprang from a recommendation made by a World Bank commission in the late 1960s. This was an era of decolonisation, independence and hope\u2014there was a growing consensus among rich nations that they had a duty to help poorer nations.</p> <p>But warm words and international targets don\u2019t necessarily lead to change \u2013 by the time Labour came to power in 1997, we spent just 0.26%. Over the next decade, that figure would rise, eventually reaching the 0.7% target.</p> <p>It was a target that David Cameron was determined to keep \u2013 it formed a key part of his early modernisation agenda. Alongside an apparent commitment to combat climate change, the promise on aid was a symbol of change within the Conservative party. Even after the financial crash, as the Conservatives dropped their commitment to matching Labour\u2019s spending and introduced an era of austerity, aid spending, like the NHS budget, was ringfenced.</p> <p>Theresa May considered scrapping the pledge but at the 2017 election <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/the-war-on-aid-the-hidden-battle-inside-priti-patels-own-department\" title=\"\">the aid industry fought a guerrilla operation</a>, dominating the news cycle for the first three days of the campaign, deploying a succession of high-profile aid supporters from Bill Gates to Rowan Williams. The prime minister relented and agreed to keep the 0.7% pledge.</p> <p>A repeat of that campaign will be difficult next time around. For a start, the aid budget\u2019s opponents, which clearly include the current DfID secretary, are better prepared. Don\u2019t be surprised if a commitment to cut 0.7% is made by one, if not all, of the candidates to replace May the next time the Conservatives choose a leader.</p> <p>But perhaps the bigger problem for the aid industry is the aid industry itself. Since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/timeline-oxfam-sexual-exploitation-scandal-in-haiti\" title=\"\">sexual exploitation scandal</a> at Oxfam, which then spread into a wider debate including <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45788872\" title=\"\">harassment at Save the Children</a>, Britain\u2019s largest NGOs have been wary of sticking their heads above the parapet. NGOs have also faced criticism, particularly from many of their own experts, that too many campaigns are fronted by celebrities, focus on the most heartbreaking stories and make too little effort to talk about long-term structural aid.</p> <p>A decade of austerity has also taken its toll. <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7026560/conservatives-actions-on-behalf-of-working-people-must-be-louder-than-its-hollow-words-or-it-could-be-fatal-for-the-party/\" title=\"\">Robert Halfon</a>, a one-time supporter of 0.7%, switched because he said he found it impossible to argue that there should be cuts in his constituency but not in the developing world. Aid supporters need to recognise that while the hard right may be leading the charge, more moderate voices are also thinking again.</p> <p>Yet what none of those who propose scrapping DfID or reducing its budget like to acknowledge is that it\u2019s actually very good at spending money. It ranks third in the annual <a href=\"https://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/the-index/2018\" title=\"\">Aid Transparency Index</a>, and among international aid experts has one of the best reputations in the world. A report published this month by the One campaign also <a href=\"https://www.one.org/international/real-aid-index/\" title=\"\">praised DfID</a> for its effectiveness, transparency and focus on poverty. In short, DfID is working.</p> <p>Would the Foreign Office be any better? Based on the current evidence, no. In recent years, portions of the aid budget have been parcelled out to other departments, including the Foreign Office. All of them, according to the One campaign report, struggle to spend them well. And the Foreign Office? Nearly at the bottom of the pile, just above the Home Office.</p> <p>The greatest irony is that those leading the campaign to undermine Britain\u2019s aid effort are also those who like to loudly trumpet the idea of \u201cglobal Britain\u201d. But if global Britain means anything, surely it means using the UK\u2019s expertise and its money \u2013 we\u2019re the sixth largest economy in the world, remember \u2013 to help those in need.</p> <p>British aid is not perfect. But it has transformed millions of lives, helped end humanitarian emergencies and boosted British soft power. It would be a tragedy if, post-Brexit, we retreated further into our shell and destroyed one of the few things we\u2019re actually good at.</p> <p>\u2022 Steve Bloomfield is the deputy editor of Prospect magazine</p>",

Jacob Rees-Mogg has long campaigned for it to be slashed, while the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has renewed his call to scrap the Department for International Development (DfID) and bring aid and development funding back into the Foreign Office, two decades after the Labour government spun it off. It\u2019s notable that aid\u2019s biggest critics are also Brexiteers \u2013 and not just in parliament. The most prominent outriders for a cut to the aid budget \u2013 newspapers such as the Sun, Daily Mail and the Express, and opaque lobby groups such as the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance and the Institute of Economic Affairs \u2013 are also Brexit\u2019s loudest cheerleaders. That\u2019s no coincidence: a form of nationalism, particularly the idea of a generous Britain being taken for a ride by foreigners, fuels both campaigns. The idea of rich nations spending 0.7% of GDP on international aid sprang from a recommendation made by a World Bank commission in the late 1960s. This was an era of decolonisation, independence and hope\u2014there was a growing consensus among rich nations that they had a duty to help poorer nations. But warm words and international targets don\u2019t necessarily lead to change \u2013 by the time Labour came to power in 1997, we spent just 0.26%. Over the next decade, that figure would rise, eventually reaching the 0.7% target. It was a target that David Cameron was determined to keep \u2013 it formed a key part of his early modernisation agenda. Alongside an apparent commitment to combat climate change, the promise on aid was a symbol of change within the Conservative party. Even after the financial crash, as the Conservatives dropped their commitment to matching Labour\u2019s spending and introduced an era of austerity, aid spending, like the NHS budget, was ringfenced. Theresa May considered scrapping the pledge but at the 2017 election the aid industry fought a guerrilla operation, dominating the news cycle for the first three days of the campaign, deploying a succession of high-profile aid supporters from Bill Gates to Rowan Williams. The prime minister relented and agreed to keep the 0.7% pledge. A repeat of that campaign will be difficult next time around. For a start, the aid budget\u2019s opponents, which clearly include the current DfID secretary, are better prepared. Don\u2019t be surprised if a commitment to cut 0.7% is made by one, if not all, of the candidates to replace May the next time the Conservatives choose a leader. But perhaps the bigger problem for the aid industry is the aid industry itself. Since the sexual exploitation scandal at Oxfam, which then spread into a wider debate including harassment at Save the Children, Britain\u2019s largest NGOs have been wary of sticking their heads above the parapet. NGOs have also faced criticism, particularly from many of their own experts, that too many campaigns are fronted by celebrities, focus on the most heartbreaking stories and make too little effort to talk about long-term structural aid. A decade of austerity has also taken its toll. Robert Halfon, a one-time supporter of 0.7%, switched because he said he found it impossible to argue that there should be cuts in his constituency but not in the developing world. Aid supporters need to recognise that while the hard right may be leading the charge, more moderate voices are also thinking again. Yet what none of those who propose scrapping DfID or reducing its budget like to acknowledge is that it\u2019s actually very good at spending money. It ranks third in the annual Aid Transparency Index, and among international aid experts has one of the best reputations in the world. A report published this month by the One campaign also praised DfID for its effectiveness, transparency and focus on poverty. In short, DfID is working. Would the Foreign Office be any better? Based on the current evidence, no. In recent years, portions of the aid budget have been parcelled out to other departments, including the Foreign Office. All of them, according to the One campaign report, struggle to spend them well. And the Foreign Office? Nearly at the bottom of the pile, just above the Home Office. The greatest irony is that those leading the campaign to undermine Britain\u2019s aid effort are also those who like to loudly trumpet the idea of \u201cglobal Britain\u201d. But if global Britain means anything, surely it means using the UK\u2019s expertise and its money \u2013 we\u2019re the sixth largest economy in the world, remember \u2013 to help those in need. British aid is not perfect. But it has transformed millions of lives, helped end humanitarian emergencies and boosted British soft power. It would be a tragedy if, post-Brexit, we retreated further into our shell and destroyed one of the few things we\u2019re actually good at. \u2022 Steve Bloomfield is the deputy editor of Prospect magazine",

US woman who joined Isis pleads to come home As Islamic State prepares for the loss of the last town in its shrunken \u201ccaliphate\u201d, some who left the west to join the group now want to go home. Hoda Muthana, an American woman who travelled to Syria and became one of Isis\u2019s most prominent online activists, told the Guardian she \u201cdeeply regrets\u201d that decision and wants to return to her family in Alabama with her 18-month-old son.

In a newly released audio clip, she tells the Guardian: \u201cI realised I\u2019ve made a big mistake. I know I\u2019ve ruined my future and my son\u2019s future and I deeply, deeply regret it.\u201d Isis Briton. Shamima Begum, a British teenager who fled to Syria in 2015 and recently gave birth at the al-Hawl camp, has said she is desperate to return to the UK. EU Isis fighters. Trump has demanded the EU take back and put on trial the 800 Isis fighters from European countries who have been captured in Syria by US-backed forces. McCabe: Trump dismissed US intel on North Korea missiles Andrew McCabe, a former acting director of the FBI, has claimed Donald Trump dismissed US intelligence advice regarding the North Korean missile threat, choosing instead to believe the word of Russian president, Vladimir Putin. In an interview to promote his memoir, McCabe told 60 Minutes he had heard from FBI colleagues, who were in a meeting with Trump, that the president said explicitly: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I believe Putin.\u201d 25th amendment. The Republican senator Lindsey Graham has said he intends to subpoena McCabe over his claim that justice department officials discussed invoking the 25th amendment to remove Trump from power. Nobel prize. The Japanese prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, nominated Trump for the Nobel peace prize after his summit with North Korea last year only because the White House asked him to, Japan\u2019s Asahi Shimbun has reported. Facebook called \u2018digital gangsters\u2019 in UK report on fake news A stinging report by the UK parliament has described Facebook and its top executives as \u201cdigital gangsters\u201d, concluding the company flagrantly broke privacy and competition law while allowing disinformation and fake news to be funnelled to its users. The report by the digital, culture, media and sport select committee is the result of an 18-month investigation, and singles out the social media firm for obstructing its inquiry and failing to tackle Russia\u2019s attempts to manipulate elections. Zuckerberg in contempt. Mark Zuckerberg was personally accused of contempt of parliament for refusing on three occasions to give evidence, instead sending junior executives who were unable to answer the committee\u2019s questions. Tech regulation. David Pegg lays out the key points in the committee\u2019s 108-page report, including its recommendation that social media be regulated under law. Catholic bishops gather in Rome for summit on sexual abuse The senior Vatican official who will lead a four-day summit on clerical sexual abuse has said the church\u2019s credibility is \u201cstrongly at stake\u201d. With more than 100 senior Catholic bishops arriving in Rome for the meeting, which begins on Thursday, Father Federico Lombardi said the issue must be tackled \u201cwith depth and without fear\u201d. Pope Francis, who will also be present, said on Sunday that sexual abuse was \u201can urgent challenge\u201d, though he has previously warned that expectations for the summit must be \u201cdeflated\u201d. McCarrick defrocked. The summit comes days after Francis defrocked Theodore McCarrick, the former cardinal and archbishop of Washington DC, who was found guilty by the Vatican of sexually abusing minors. McCarrick is the most senior figure to be removed from priesthood in modern times. Crib sheet Senior Polish government officials may cancel a planned trip to Israel after the Israeli acting foreign minister Yisrael Katz suggested antisemitism \u201cwas innate among the Poles before the Holocaust, during it and after it too\u201d. Four Indian soldiers and a civilian have been killed in a firefight in the disputed Kashmir region, where authorities are hunting for suspected members of the Islamist militant group that killed 44 Indian paramilitary police in a suicide bombing last week. Almost 100 current and former Walmart workers have launched gender discrimination lawsuits against the world\u2019s largest retailer, alleging unequal pay and a lack of advancement opportunities for women. YouTube is to blame for a startling rise in the number of people who believe the Earth is flat, according to researchers who interviewed attendees at two key Flat Earther conferences. Must-reads Ilhan Omar takes her turn in the spotlight The new Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota Ilhan Omar is already learning to weather controversy, after her comments about the Israel lobby and a confrontation with the conservative grandee Elliott Abrams. Sabrina Siddiqui reports. The battle between Radiohead and EMI\u2019s Guy Hands Radiohead shocked the music industry in 2007 when they released their seventh album, In Rainbows, online and without a label. As Eamonn Forde writes in an extract from his new book, it came down to a battle between the band and the private equity firm who had just bought EMI. How the Panama Papers have tightened the noose on Maduro Until 2016, the Venezuelan elite who\u2019d grown rich from their links to the Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro government liked to launder their money through Panamanian real estate. The release of the Panama Papers all but put a stop to that, as Mat Youkee reports from Panama City. A different vision of Holocaust remembrance Germany\u2019s Stolpersteine, or \u201cstumbling stones\u201d, are memorials to individual victims of the Holocaust, small brass blocks placed among the cobblestones outside their last-known freely chosen residence. The idea was conceived by artist Gunter Demnig in 1992, writes Eliza Apperly. There are 70,000 such stones across Germany. Opinion The Trump administration does not just dislike the European Union, it wants to destroy it, says Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de. And Mike Pompeo\u2019s tour of Budapest, Bratislava and Warsaw last week was designed to drive a wedge between eastern and western Europe. Through his choice of destinations, Pompeo amplified divisions between countries formerly behind the iron curtain and those that weren\u2019t. This astutely plays on sensitivities, manipulated by demagogues, that have marred the EU\u2019s capacity to unite in recent years. Sport Denny Hamlin won the Daytona 500 for the second time in four years on Sunday, after a series of crashes took out all but 14 of the cars in the field. Hamlin dedicated the victory to JD Gibbs, the co-founder of his team, Joe Gibbs Racing, who died last month. You\u2019d be forgiven for assuming America\u2019s various lower-level professional and elite soccer leagues were working together to build a promotion/relegation pyramid, from regional leagues up to a national league that could rival or even merge with Major League Soccer.

      "bodyText": "Death threats, bullying, mental torture, privacy invasion, election rigging, fake news, monopoly abuse: as was said of a medieval pope, this is merely to suppress more serious charges. It is hard to recall the social media of 15 years ago and its offer of universal love, democracy and global peace. Britain\u2019s parliament has finally caught up, and today\u2019s Commons report is at least unequivocal. A menace stalks the land, and must be curbed. Some of the report\u2019s accusations are astonishing. Facebook \u201cpurposefully obstructed\u201d the committee. Its boss, Mark Zuckerberg, who \u201ccontinues to choose profit over data security,\u201d held parliament in contempt. His rambling empire is portrayed as lying, thieving \u201cdigital gangsterism\u201d. Yet British electoral law is puny. It is \u201cunfit for purpose,\u201d leaving elections \u201cvulnerable to foreign influence, disinformation and voter manipulation\u201d. Not a week passes without evidence that cybersecurity is inadequate and public services have been left vulnerable to hacking. So far, so familiar, as are the report\u2019s proposals: the usual comfort blankets of a code of ethics, an independent regulator and \u201cmore transparency\u201d. We have sought them for a decade and still not found them. The real question is, why not? What are the pressures, who are the lobbyists, why the inertia?

Lowe\u2019s reputation wouldn\u2019t recover for a decade. Bowman was immediately forced to sign a gagging order about her experience and vanished into obscurity (she described the ordeal in a rare interview with the Hollywood Reporter: \u201cThat number was 15 minutes long from start to end, and I remember looking at Rob Lowe, going: \u2018It\u2019s finally over!\u2019\u201d). The whole thing was an obscene mess and, having learned from its mistakes, the Oscars never went without a host again. Until this year. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 February 2019 because an earlier version said that after the 1989 Academy Awards, Allan Carr never worked again. That has been corrected to say he never again worked as a Hollywood producer.",

      "bodyText": "Japanese officials have reportedly accused Jeremy Hunt and Liam Fox of taking a \u201chigh-handed\u201d approach towards a post-Brexit free trade deal, and briefly considered cancelling bilateral talks due to take place this week. The Financial Times cited unnamed officials in Tokyo who reacted with dismay to a letter sent on 8 February in which Hunt, the foreign secretary, and Fox, the international trade secretary, insisted that \u201ctime is of the essence\u201d in securing a trade deal with Japan, the world\u2019s third-biggest economy. Hunt and Fox also called for flexibility on both sides \u2013 an approach the paper said had been interpreted as criticism that Japan did not share their desire to quickly conclude a free trade agreement after Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union on 29 March. The letter, which British officials said had employed standard diplomatic language, had briefly prompted Japanese officials to consider cancelling trade talks in Tokyo this week, the paper reported. According to the FT, they took exception to a line in which Hunt and Fox said \u201cwe are committed to [speed and flexibility] and hope that Japan is too\u201d, interpreting it as an intimation that the Japanese side lacked a sense of urgency. An official at the Japanese foreign ministry confirmed that the trade talks would go ahead as scheduled, but declined to comment on the contents of the letter or Japan\u2019s response. \u201cThere are many communications over advancing the economic and diplomatic partnership between Japan and Britain,\u201d the official told the Guardian, adding: \u201cBut I can\u2019t comment on individual communications.\u201d The newspaper also reported that Japanese trade officials were growing frustrated with their British counterparts, who had arrived at meetings without specialists capable of taking the talks forward. Asked about the reports later on Monday, Fox said that most trade with Japan in the past has been done without a free trade deal. But reports that Hunt and Fox\u2019s letter had irritated Japan are adding to scepticism over assurances made by Brexiters that Britain would ease its way into lucrative free trade deals once it leaves the EU. To add to Britain\u2019s frustration, Japan has reportedly ruled out simply replicating the terms of a Japan-EU trade agreement that went into effect at the start of this month but which will be unavailable to the UK after Brexit. Instead, it will seek tougher concessions from Britain than it secured from the EU. Japanese firms, which together employ about 140,000 people in the UK, have made no secret of their alarm at the prospect that Britain will crash out of the EU without a deal. Earlier this month, Nissan said uncertainty over Brexit was partly behind its decision to abandon plans to build a new model of one of its flagship vehicles at its Sunderland plant. Reports of Japan\u2019s angry response to the tactics employed by Hunt and Fox emerged days after China abruptly cancelled a crucial trade meeting with the chancellor, Philip Hammond, due to take place in Beijing this week. Hammond\u2019s visit was called off after the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, warned that Britain could deploy an aircraft carrier in the Pacific, where Beijing has been involved in a dispute over territorial claims in the South China Sea.",

Some people think it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/adam-mckay-surprising-reactions-vice-how-hed-tackle-a-trump-film-1185439\">the year\u2019s best film</a>, others <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/review-dick-cheney-biopic-vice-is-as-subtle-as-a-shot-to-the-face\">think its among the worst</a>, and others still reckon it\u2019s a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/26/history-vice-uncivil-war-dick-cheney\"> threat to the very notion of truth itself</a>. Small wonder then that a movie this polarising is unlikely to become the consensus pick for the best picture Oscar: you can get odds as long as 125/1 for a Vice win.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the thing though: Vice\u2019s very contentiousness is the reason that it would make an interesting and timely best picture winner. This is a film that is designed to stir the pot, to rattle cages, to instigate uncomfortable heated arguments in cinema lobbies. It\u2019s a film that instead of blandly asking, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just get along\u201d explains bluntly why we don\u2019t.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/christianbale\">Christian Bale</a>, embarking on one of his frequent \u201cdramatic transformations\u201d, stars as Cheney, a figure who seems to have a Zelig-like ability to pop up at every formative event of the modern Republican party, from the dying days of the Nixon administration, through the rise of Reagan and the violent lurch rightward of the supreme court, and finally to the Bush administration, where the quarter-century political long game he has been playing finally and spectacularly bears fruit.</p> <p>As vice-president to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sam-rockwell\">Sam Rockwell</a>\u2019s grinning, inane <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-bush\">George W Bush</a>, he is able to spectacularly reconfigure the role in his favour, accruing dull-seeming duties that together form a supergroup of unchecked powers, powers that \u2013 cheered on by his wife Lynne (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/amy-adams\">Amy Adams</a>, playing the role as sort-of Lady Macbeth of the midwest) \u2013 he uses to pursue plutocracy, military adventurism and corruption. (The double meaning of the film\u2019s title, in keeping with so much else in this film, is unapologetically, thuddingly on the nose.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"212fef5a66af76f2c49d2b9bb05ffdcb2a3d92b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/212fef5a66af76f2c49d2b9bb05ffdcb2a3d92b2/0_0_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grinningly inane \u2026 Christian Bale with Sam Rockwell as George Bush.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grinningly inane \u2026 Christian Bale with Sam Rockwell as George Bush.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Annapurna Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Inevitably, there\u2019s been more attention on Bale\u2019s physical transformation than his acting. Certainly he looks spectacularly chunky \u2013 perhaps more rotund than Cheney himself ever was. But more impressive is the compelling stillness of his performance. At times he seems to barely move at all, beyond the agile flickering of his eyes, calculating his next nefarious move.</p> <p>Some of Vice\u2019s many critics have suggested that this Cheney is too cartoonishly villainous \u2013 that there\u2019s nothing more to him than a grasping pursuit of power for power\u2019s sake.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s difficult to remember an Oscar nominee that prompted a range of reactions quite like Vice, Adam McKay\u2019s account of the squalid rise to power of George W Bush\u2019s right-hand-man Dick Cheney. Some people think it\u2019s the year\u2019s best film, others think its among the worst, and others still reckon it\u2019s a threat to the very notion of truth itself. Small wonder then that a movie this polarising is unlikely to become the consensus pick for the best picture Oscar: you can get odds as long as 125/1 for a Vice win. Here\u2019s the thing though: Vice\u2019s very contentiousness is the reason that it would make an interesting and timely best picture winner. This is a film that is designed to stir the pot, to rattle cages, to instigate uncomfortable heated arguments in cinema lobbies. It\u2019s a film that instead of blandly asking, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just get along\u201d explains bluntly why we don\u2019t. Christian Bale, embarking on one of his frequent \u201cdramatic transformations\u201d, stars as Cheney, a figure who seems to have a Zelig-like ability to pop up at every formative event of the modern Republican party, from the dying days of the Nixon administration, through the rise of Reagan and the violent lurch rightward of the supreme court, and finally to the Bush administration, where the quarter-century political long game he has been playing finally and spectacularly bears fruit. As vice-president to Sam Rockwell\u2019s grinning, inane George W Bush, he is able to spectacularly reconfigure the role in his favour, accruing dull-seeming duties that together form a supergroup of unchecked powers, powers that \u2013 cheered on by his wife Lynne (Amy Adams, playing the role as sort-of Lady Macbeth of the midwest) \u2013 he uses to pursue plutocracy, military adventurism and corruption. (The double meaning of the film\u2019s title, in keeping with so much else in this film, is unapologetically, thuddingly on the nose.) Inevitably, there\u2019s been more attention on Bale\u2019s physical transformation than his acting. Certainly he looks spectacularly chunky \u2013 perhaps more rotund than Cheney himself ever was. But more impressive is the compelling stillness of his performance. At times he seems to barely move at all, beyond the agile flickering of his eyes, calculating his next nefarious move. Some of Vice\u2019s many critics have suggested that this Cheney is too cartoonishly villainous \u2013 that there\u2019s nothing more to him than a grasping pursuit of power for power\u2019s sake. But, in recent years, \u201cpower for power\u2019s sake\u201d is a pretty accurate summing up of the Republican party, whose long-held positions (budget deficits, free trade, Russia) have miraculously reversed now Trump is in charge; all that matters these days, it seems, is winning. Indeed, Vice is keen to point out the ominous through line from its subject to Trump, who as commander in chief has a chilling arsenal of powers to call on thanks to Cheney\u2019s assiduous work in building up the supremacy of the office.

      "body": "<p>After a weekend of flu-affected action, jump racing will return to something like a level playing field this week and Dan Skelton is one of many trainers hoping his horses will be able to run to their best despite an unscheduled round of vaccinations. The new rule requiring runners to have had a recent vaccination came in last Monday night, since when the normally prolific Skelton has had just five runners, but it will be a different story this week; lots of his horses got their jabs and will be eligible to run from Tuesday.</p> \n<p>The Warwickshire trainer told me of his concern that some of those vaccinated last week, at his yard and at many others, may not run to form right away. \u201cYou are going to get horses this week and possibly the week after that seem OK at home but don\u2019t run as well as expected. Some are going to feel no different and some are going to feel a bit down and you can\u2019t tell until you get to the business end of a race.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/16/clan-des-obeaux-underlines-gold-cup-hopes-imperious-ascot-win-horse-racing-coneygree-retires\">Clan Des Obeaux shines as Paul Nicholls lands 45,863-1 eight-timer</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the owners I feel sorry for. They expect the horses to be in tip-top form at this time of year and rightly so, and they normally are but we\u2019ve been forced to do something outside of the normal and we just don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to work. This has been thrust upon us and we\u2019ve just got to get on with it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Skelton does not expect that this round of vaccinations will affect performances at the Cheltenham Festival in a month\u2019s time. \u201cThe effects, even if they are negative, don\u2019t last much beyond a fortnight. Cheltenham, you\u2019ll have a level playing field by then.\u201d</p> \n<p>But this week\u2019s prep runs might be a different story. \u201cThe ones I want to run this week and on Saturday, I feel very strongly that I want to run, to find out which race they go for [at Cheltenham]. They might need another run, especially the novices. We have had to give them the flu vaccs, we\u2019re doing everything we can to mitigate any negatives and just hope they don\u2019t have a short-term negative effect. But it\u2019s a flip of a coin, as to individual horses. We\u2019ve just got to do everything we can to make sure they\u2019re as well as they can be.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9dc17b2123ff35e05206345b383c12c6e8e3e69c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dc17b2123ff35e05206345b383c12c6e8e3e69c/56_410_4669_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trainer Dan Skelton, centre, and jockey Bridget Andrews celebrate winning the Randox Health County Handicap Hurdle Race at Cheltenham last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trainer Dan Skelton, centre, and jockey Bridget Andrews celebrate winning the Randox Health County Handicap Hurdle Race at Cheltenham last year.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seb Daly/Sportsfile via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got Tokay Dokey in the Dovecote [at Kempton on Saturday], Protektorat in the Adonis, I\u2019ve got a few in the handicaps that are en route to Cheltenham and we need to know what trips they\u2019re going. I\u2019ve got a couple to go up to Newcastle, one for the Eider, hopefully. I\u2019d have been competing last week in all those big races, like a lot of us that weren\u2019t there. Hopefully it\u2019s all behind us, that\u2019s the main thing to say now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Turning to Monday\u2019s action, I like 10-1 about <strong>Pearl Swan (3.50)</strong> in the Surrey National at Lingfield. You might remember him from the Triumph Hurdle seven years ago, when he was making a charge from the back before capsizing at the last.</p> \n<p>He\u2019s with Peter Bowen these days and, having been highly tried in two runs over fences last year, has come back down to his last winning mark of two years ago. There was a bit to like about his reappearance run last month and this could be the time to catch him.</p> \n<p>Sue Smith could have a good day at Carlisle, thanks at least in part to <strong>Absolutely Dylan (3.00)</strong>, who was having his fourth quick run when mildly disappointing at Newcastle before Christmas. His progress could resume in this race, which lacks depth. He\u2019s 5-2.</p> \n<p>One firm briefly went 7-1 about the nap, <strong>Camile (5.00)</strong> at Newcastle, but she was pretty soon down to a general 5-2. Formerly with Joseph O\u2019Brien, she is having her second run for Iain Jardine, having won over hurdles on her debut for him. She may have been a mite lucky that day but it would be a surprise if she doesn\u2019t prove ahead of her lowly Flat rating.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5cf5eb4a-bda8-4c15-9e71-21d2ad21270f\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Carlisle:</b> 2.00 Vis A Vis, 2.30 Petite Ganache, 3.00 Absolutely Dylan, 3.35 Informateur, 4.05 Len Brennan, 4.40 Dorking Cock, 5.10 Taking Flight.</p>\n    <p><b>Lingfield:</b> 1.45 Ehmaj, 2.15 Smiths Cross, 2.45 Waikiki Waves, 3.15 New Age Dawning, 3.50 Pearl Swan (nb), 4.25 Bee Crossing, 4.55 Full Trottle.</p>\n    <p><b>Newcastle:</b> 5.00 Camile (nap), 5.30 Giacomo Casanova, 6.00 Lion Hearted,6.30 Beresford, 7.00 Equitation, 7.30 Captain Lars, 8.00 Avenue Of Stars.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "After a weekend of flu-affected action, jump racing will return to something like a level playing field this week and Dan Skelton is one of many trainers hoping his horses will be able to run to their best despite an unscheduled round of vaccinations. The new rule requiring runners to have had a recent vaccination came in last Monday night, since when the normally prolific Skelton has had just five runners, but it will be a different story this week; lots of his horses got their jabs and will be eligible to run from Tuesday. The Warwickshire trainer told me of his concern that some of those vaccinated last week, at his yard and at many others, may not run to form right away. \u201cYou are going to get horses this week and possibly the week after that seem OK at home but don\u2019t run as well as expected. Some are going to feel no different and some are going to feel a bit down and you can\u2019t tell until you get to the business end of a race. \u201cIt\u2019s the owners I feel sorry for. They expect the horses to be in tip-top form at this time of year and rightly so, and they normally are but we\u2019ve been forced to do something outside of the normal and we just don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to work. This has been thrust upon us and we\u2019ve just got to get on with it.\u201d Skelton does not expect that this round of vaccinations will affect performances at the Cheltenham Festival in a month\u2019s time. \u201cThe effects, even if they are negative, don\u2019t last much beyond a fortnight. Cheltenham, you\u2019ll have a level playing field by then.\u201d But this week\u2019s prep runs might be a different story. \u201cThe ones I want to run this week and on Saturday, I feel very strongly that I want to run, to find out which race they go for [at Cheltenham]. They might need another run, especially the novices. We have had to give them the flu vaccs, we\u2019re doing everything we can to mitigate any negatives and just hope they don\u2019t have a short-term negative effect. But it\u2019s a flip of a coin, as to individual horses. We\u2019ve just got to do everything we can to make sure they\u2019re as well as they can be. \u201cI\u2019ve got Tokay Dokey in the Dovecote [at Kempton on Saturday], Protektorat in the Adonis, I\u2019ve got a few in the handicaps that are en route to Cheltenham and we need to know what trips they\u2019re going. I\u2019ve got a couple to go up to Newcastle, one for the Eider, hopefully. I\u2019d have been competing last week in all those big races, like a lot of us that weren\u2019t there. Hopefully it\u2019s all behind us, that\u2019s the main thing to say now.\u201d Turning to Monday\u2019s action, I like 10-1 about Pearl Swan (3.50) in the Surrey National at Lingfield. You might remember him from the Triumph Hurdle seven years ago, when he was making a charge from the back before capsizing at the last. He\u2019s with Peter Bowen these days and, having been highly tried in two runs over fences last year, has come back down to his last winning mark of two years ago. There was a bit to like about his reappearance run last month and this could be the time to catch him. Sue Smith could have a good day at Carlisle, thanks at least in part to Absolutely Dylan (3.00), who was having his fourth quick run when mildly disappointing at Newcastle before Christmas. His progress could resume in this race, which lacks depth. He\u2019s 5-2. One firm briefly went 7-1 about the nap, Camile (5.00) at Newcastle, but she was pretty soon down to a general 5-2. Formerly with Joseph O\u2019Brien, she is having her second run for Iain Jardine, having won over hurdles on her debut for him. She may have been a mite lucky that day but it would be a surprise if she doesn\u2019t prove ahead of her lowly Flat rating.",

In his opening statement, Outram also took the opportunity to share specific information about his organisation\u2019s involvement. He said Interpol distributed Bahrain\u2019s red notice on 8 November, and AFP sent it to the border force the following day. The border force accessed the notice on 22 November, 13 days later but within the standard 14 days he said it took the department to get to each of the approximately 600 received each month. \u201cIt ran details across home affairs systems \u2026 and an alert was created on the basis of the red notice.\u201d \u201cWhen the ABF match a person to an Interpol alert, a true match notification advice is manually sent from the ABF to the AFP national central bureau and the Department of Home Affairs visa and citizenship group,\u201d Outram said. \u201cOn this occasion [it] was not.\u201d This was an error, he said, by an individual officer who was \u201cdiligent\u201d in his work but \u201cneglected to send an email\u201d. \u201cThis is where the process broke down.\u201d Outram did not blame the individual officer, but rather said the department was dealing with \u201clegacy\u201d systems which required almost entirely manual operation. \u201cOur officers work around the clock, managing huge volumes of transactions which require manual processes to bridge gaps between disparate IT systems,\u201d he said. \u201cHuman error can and will continue to occur, but it is rare.\u201d On Tuesday the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, agreed it was a \u201cmistake\u201d. \u201cThe officers dropped the ball on this, but that\u2019s a human error that\u2019s been made and let\u2019s put all of the hype aside,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no conspiracy that somebody is being denied information. It is a mistake that was made by an officer within border force and I think the commissioners Outram and [AFP commissioner Andrew] Colvin have dealt with it appropriately.\u201d Amnesty International Australia called for an independent investigation into the \u201cmonumental mistake\u201d. The error \u201ccost a young man and his family months of heartache and could have cost them much more had he been sent back to Bahrain\u201d, its spokesman, Tim O\u2019Connor, said. \u201cThe results of any investigation must be made public immediately, and systems put in place to ensure no other person will suffer as Hakeem and his family have. \u2018Human error\u2019 must never again result in someone\u2019s life being endangered.\u201d Outram had also explained information must be individually downloaded for each red notice on the list, often in other languages, and the department must seek translations. \u201cIf this system was fully automated that would be nirvana for all of us,\u201d he said. The AFP\u2019s deputy commissioner, Ramzi Jabbour, made particular note of the fact that Bahrain was granted its red notice on the same day the Thai consulate in Melbourne approved Al-Araibi\u2019s visa, almost a full year after Al-Araibi was given refugee status. He didn\u2019t have the information which would allow him to call it anything but a coincidence.",

She had written some poetry in Dutch when, in 2010, she started going to literary festivals, and then, in Berne, formed a mentored workshop with two other poets. The workshop trio writes in German as well as English and also translates from English into German. Moving to a retirement home five years ago, Fischer continued to write prolifically, publish and win competitions. Her collection <a href=\"https://templarpoetry.com/products/palmistry-in-karachi\">Palmistry in Karachi</a> was published in 2017. She also teaches an English conversation class \u2013 referred to above as \u201cour coterie\u201d \u2013 an exemplary form of advanced language practice, since she always begins the session with a poem.</p> <p>The poems in her new pamphlet, <a href=\"http://www.greyhenpress.com/hen-run/\">Hourglass</a> (bravely, even defiantly, subtitled \u201cPoems from the retirement home\u201d), cast a cool, clear eye on her various neighbours. As in <a href=\"https://bsapostcardpoems.wordpress.com/2015/05/04/elsa-fischer-women-bathing/\">her ekphrastic poems</a>, Fischer notes the essential details needed to make the figure blossom and reveal character. \u201cAs you set out \u2026\u201d is a restrained elegy for the poet\u2019s friend, Ursula S, admiring but retaining a certain detachment. The poem is understatedly conscious of the question of how to live but also, implicitly, how to live well in the period imprecisely named retirement. It is both shadowed and illuminated by <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51296/ithaka-56d22eef917ec\">CP Cavafy\u2019s much-loved poem Ithaka</a>, whose beginning the title echoes. Fischer recalls in a note how impressed by the poem her class was, Ursula S particularly.</p> <p>In the first two couplets, the addressee is seen only through the postmortem lens of a sharply practical family, sweeping clean. From her ownership of \u201cthe Giacometti\u201d and her regular visits to the hairdresser, we can infer that Ursula S was well-off, cultivated, perhaps fastidious. And we might predict that the portrait will be of a slightly chilly \u201cmaterial girl\u201d for whom even Cavafy\u2019s great poem is a cultural artefact.</p> <p>We would be completely wrong. The characterisation of Ursula S acquires complexity and increased dignity. Her discovery of a special, personal meaning in a particular line from the poem is the small narrative depth charge that alters our perspective.</p> <p>A change of emotion occurs with the speaker\u2019s entry into the tercet: \u201cI copied out the Cavafy we\u2019d hotly discussed / in our coterie, the poem urging us to keep / Ithaca always in our minds.\u201d The young, energetic words, \u201chotly\u201d and \u201curged\u201d, seem carefully chosen. The act of copying out the poem illustrates the speaker\u2019s direct, serious re-engagement with the text. This is on a different plane from the \u201cbought\u201d contact with art of the collector or connoisseur. It takes the narrative to a more fundamental and intimate level. The Cavafy poem, having been shared by the two women and \u201chotly discussed\u201d, is now put to the test and it\u2019s the student who reminds the teacher of its essential insight.</p> <p>Cavafy\u2019s Ithaka (<a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51296/ithaka-56d22eef917ec\">in English here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.babelmatrix.org/works/el/Kav%C3%A1fisz,_Konsztand%C3%ADnosz-1863/%CE%99%CE%B8%CE%AC%CE%BA%CE%B7/de/43838-Ithaka\">in the original Greek</a>, with a German translation, <a href=\"http://www.babelmatrix.org/works/el/Kav%C3%A1fisz,_Konsztand%C3%ADnosz-1863/%CE%99%CE%B8%CE%AC%CE%BA%CE%B7/de/43838-Ithaka\">here</a>) embodies values Ursula S would recognise: the delight in beautiful things that please the senses and the importance of learning. The ultimate values, though, are neither aesthetic nor intellectual: the line that Ursula S has picked out to quote back at Fischer is the poet\u2019s advice on how to conduct oneself, and protect oneself psychologically, on the journey: \u201cKeep Ithaka always in your mind.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cproject\u201d for Cavafy is to sustain, without impatience, the desire for Ithaka throughout the journey, and, having arrived, to rejoice in what has been learned on the way. Ithaka is not a single, simple locus of return for Cavafy\u2019s addressee: his \u201cyou\u201d is not identical with homesick Odysseus. The poem is about the process of arrival. Arrival, like return, may well be superficially disappointing but the speaker insists, \u201cAnd if you find her poor, Ithaka won\u2019t have fooled you. / Wise as you will have become, so full of experience, / you\u2019ll have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.\u201d Even at the point where the body declines and the horizon fades, at the point where you must set out for death, Ithaka may be the necessary fiction. This is what Fischer\u2019s poem (\u201cfrom the retirement home\u201d) adds to Cavafy\u2019s \u2013 and perhaps how it challenges it.</p> <p>\u201cYou were not ostentatious in that way,\u201d the speaker says, importantly separating her subject from the ladies who \u201cshow off bejewelled hands\u201d when dining in the refectory, \u201cbut always seemed to be on a mission // of importance, your thoughts raised high, / your crutch a staff of office\u201d. The lines refer to Cavafy\u2019s first stanza, in which he tells the traveller that there will be no terrors on the journey, \u201cas long as you keep your thoughts raised high\u201d. Ursula S, disabled physically by age, as revealed by the reference to her crutch, emerges with her own strength, beauty and dignity, having journeyed through the poem beyond the aesthetic materiality that first defined her.</p> <p>The simple, quiet demotic of Fischer\u2019s \u201cAs you set out \u2026\u201d honours Cavafy as well as the women who have read him with such bravery and passion \u2013 the poet herself and the one who wasn\u2019t a poet. Fischer reminds us that sometimes, at least, we don\u2019t simply read poems with our eyes and minds: we read them with our lives.</p> <p><br></p>",

In the first two couplets, the addressee is seen only through the postmortem lens of a sharply practical family, sweeping clean. From her ownership of \u201cthe Giacometti\u201d and her regular visits to the hairdresser, we can infer that Ursula S was well-off, cultivated, perhaps fastidious. And we might predict that the portrait will be of a slightly chilly \u201cmaterial girl\u201d for whom even Cavafy\u2019s great poem is a cultural artefact. We would be completely wrong. The characterisation of Ursula S acquires complexity and increased dignity. Her discovery of a special, personal meaning in a particular line from the poem is the small narrative depth charge that alters our perspective. A change of emotion occurs with the speaker\u2019s entry into the tercet: \u201cI copied out the Cavafy we\u2019d hotly discussed / in our coterie, the poem urging us to keep / Ithaca always in our minds.\u201d The young, energetic words, \u201chotly\u201d and \u201curged\u201d, seem carefully chosen. The act of copying out the poem illustrates the speaker\u2019s direct, serious re-engagement with the text. This is on a different plane from the \u201cbought\u201d contact with art of the collector or connoisseur. It takes the narrative to a more fundamental and intimate level. The Cavafy poem, having been shared by the two women and \u201chotly discussed\u201d, is now put to the test and it\u2019s the student who reminds the teacher of its essential insight. Cavafy\u2019s Ithaka (in English here and in the original Greek, with a German translation, here) embodies values Ursula S would recognise: the delight in beautiful things that please the senses and the importance of learning. The ultimate values, though, are neither aesthetic nor intellectual: the line that Ursula S has picked out to quote back at Fischer is the poet\u2019s advice on how to conduct oneself, and protect oneself psychologically, on the journey: \u201cKeep Ithaka always in your mind.\u201d The \u201cproject\u201d for Cavafy is to sustain, without impatience, the desire for Ithaka throughout the journey, and, having arrived, to rejoice in what has been learned on the way. Ithaka is not a single, simple locus of return for Cavafy\u2019s addressee: his \u201cyou\u201d is not identical with homesick Odysseus. The poem is about the process of arrival. Arrival, like return, may well be superficially disappointing but the speaker insists, \u201cAnd if you find her poor, Ithaka won\u2019t have fooled you. / Wise as you will have become, so full of experience, / you\u2019ll have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.\u201d Even at the point where the body declines and the horizon fades, at the point where you must set out for death, Ithaka may be the necessary fiction. This is what Fischer\u2019s poem (\u201cfrom the retirement home\u201d) adds to Cavafy\u2019s \u2013 and perhaps how it challenges it. \u201cYou were not ostentatious in that way,\u201d the speaker says, importantly separating her subject from the ladies who \u201cshow off bejewelled hands\u201d when dining in the refectory, \u201cbut always seemed to be on a mission // of importance, your thoughts raised high, / your crutch a staff of office\u201d. The lines refer to Cavafy\u2019s first stanza, in which he tells the traveller that there will be no terrors on the journey, \u201cas long as you keep your thoughts raised high\u201d. Ursula S, disabled physically by age, as revealed by the reference to her crutch, emerges with her own strength, beauty and dignity, having journeyed through the poem beyond the aesthetic materiality that first defined her. The simple, quiet demotic of Fischer\u2019s \u201cAs you set out \u2026\u201d honours Cavafy as well as the women who have read him with such bravery and passion \u2013 the poet herself and the one who wasn\u2019t a poet. Fischer reminds us that sometimes, at least, we don\u2019t simply read poems with our eyes and minds: we read them with our lives.",

It was not created until the 29th Academy Awards in 1956, although special awards were given to foreign films before that. Only one entry per country is allowed, and that film must be submitted by an approved national organisation (such as Bafta for Britain), although entries don\u2019t have to be in the national language. A shortlist of nine is created by the Academy\u2019s special committee, which is then whittled down to five by \u201cspecially invited committees\u201d in LA, New York and London. And then, only Academy members who have seen all five are allowed to vote on the winner. It\u2019s easier picking a new pope.</p> <p>It\u2019s not as though the Oscars matter <em>that</em> much, but foreign language cinema is on the decline. In the UK last year, they made up just over 2% of the box office gross, and half of that was Bollywood. Lured by the huge English-speaking market, film-makers are increasingly abandoning their national languages. Look at Chilean-Argentinian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/17/sebastian-lelio-disobedience-interview-rachel-weisz-naomi-alderman\">Sebasti\u00e1n Lelio</a>, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/14/a-fantastic-woman-review-sebastian-lelio-daniela-vega\">A Fantastic Woman</a> won the best foreign language film Oscar last year. He has followed that up with two English movies: Disobedience, set in London, and a remake of his (Spanish-language) 2013 movie Gloria, set in Los Angeles, starring Julianne Moore. There are others: Italy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/22/luca-guadagnino-call-me-by-your-name-step-inside-teenage-dreams\">Luca Guadagnino</a>, for example, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/09/yorgos-lanthimos-the-favourite-interview\">Greece\u2019s Yorgos Lanthimos</a>, whose The Favourite is Roma\u2019s biggest Oscar rival this year. Cuar\u00f3n is another. Like fellow Mexicans Alejandro I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and Guillermo del Toro, he has already achieved success working in English \u2013 with Gravity. His decision to return to Spanish with Roma is potentially game-changing.</p> <p>Even if it doesn\u2019t win, Roma is a reminder that beyond the Anglophone zone there\u2019s a world of cinema out there, and we\u2019re seeing less and less of it.</p>",

Of course, the Oscars is Hollywood voting on its favourite movie, which means \u201cAmerica first\u201d, but it\u2019s \u201cbest picture\u201d, right? As in \u201cbest picture in the world\u201d, not \u201cbest picture by an American or Brit\u201d. You could go back over the years and rank any number of foreign-language films above the best picture winner (was A Beautiful Mind better than In the Mood for Love in 2001?). You can do the same with this year\u2019s nominees: give me Cold War and Shoplifters over Bohemian Rhapsody and Green Book any day. Or you could look at world cinema greats such as Godard, Ozu, Fellini or Bergman and ask: were none of the films they made as good as what Hollywood had to offer? The foreign language Oscar is already a messy afterthought. It was not created until the 29th Academy Awards in 1956, although special awards were given to foreign films before that. Only one entry per country is allowed, and that film must be submitted by an approved national organisation (such as Bafta for Britain), although entries don\u2019t have to be in the national language. A shortlist of nine is created by the Academy\u2019s special committee, which is then whittled down to five by \u201cspecially invited committees\u201d in LA, New York and London. And then, only Academy members who have seen all five are allowed to vote on the winner. It\u2019s easier picking a new pope. It\u2019s not as though the Oscars matter that much, but foreign language cinema is on the decline. In the UK last year, they made up just over 2% of the box office gross, and half of that was Bollywood. Lured by the huge English-speaking market, film-makers are increasingly abandoning their national languages. Look at Chilean-Argentinian Sebasti\u00e1n Lelio, whose A Fantastic Woman won the best foreign language film Oscar last year. He has followed that up with two English movies: Disobedience, set in London, and a remake of his (Spanish-language) 2013 movie Gloria, set in Los Angeles, starring Julianne Moore. There are others: Italy\u2019s Luca Guadagnino, for example, or Greece\u2019s Yorgos Lanthimos, whose The Favourite is Roma\u2019s biggest Oscar rival this year. Cuar\u00f3n is another. Like fellow Mexicans Alejandro I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and Guillermo del Toro, he has already achieved success working in English \u2013 with Gravity. His decision to return to Spanish with Roma is potentially game-changing. Even if it doesn\u2019t win, Roma is a reminder that beyond the Anglophone zone there\u2019s a world of cinema out there, and we\u2019re seeing less and less of it.",

Arsenal are among a number of clubs after Roma\u2019s Greek central defender Kostas Manolas, whose club are preparing to offer him a new deal in the hope of significantly raising (or removing) his comparatively paltry buy-out clause of \u00a331.5m. Meanwhile at Napoli, Belgian forward Dries Mertens is mulling over a summer move to China. Arsenal have identified 19-year-old Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Kai Havertz as a replacement for Mesut \u00d6zil, who hasn\u2019t actually gone anywhere and looks unlikely to do so any time soon. West Ham are hoping to replace one ageing, past-his-pomp full-back with another by bringing Antonio Valencia to the London Stadium from Manchester United, if Pablo Zabaleta decides to retire. And finally, unable to get a look-in at Burnley, goalkeeping\u2019s Nick Pope may move to Arsenal, who have a better class of bench.",

I know so many trans people who got their first bra from Victoria\u2019s Secret. The brand does set a standard of what is deemed sexy and fashionable within the industry \u2013 they could harness that power to make positive changes.

US security adviseer John Bolton has suggested that Maduro and his inner circle should take \u201ca long, quiet retirement \u2026 on a nice beach somewhere far from Venezuela.\u201d</p> <p>But the <em>boliburgues </em>can be forgiven for not taking Bolton at his word. Senior Panamanian sources told The Guardian<em> </em>that since early 2017 the US\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) had been working with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima_Group\">Lima Group</a><strong> </strong>of 12 Latin American countries and Canada to identify illegal offshore assets belonging to members of the Maduro regime.</p> <p>In November Miami courts ruled that Alejandro Andrade, Chavez\u2019s private secretary turned head of treasury, had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/world/americas/venezuela-andrade-corruption-bribes.html\">accepted $1bn in bribes for providing access to preferential currency rates as part of a money laundering scam</a>. He received a 10-year sentence and his Florida mansion, collection of classic cars and 17 racehorses are to be auctioned by the US treasury.</p> <p>\u201cThe Andrade case was an inflection point,\u201d says Scharfenburg. \u201cIt was assumed he had done a deal with US authorities to escape prosecution. Since 2016, the US\u2019s approach has changed, the <em>boliburgues</em> know they are under vigilance and they are increasingly trying to move their cash to places like Turkey and the UAE.\u201d</p> <p>In October federal courts also gave a 10-year sentence to Matthias Krull, a Panama-based banker who allegedly <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-29/julius-baer-ex-banker-gets-10-years-in-venezuela-launder-case\">managed accounts for 500 Venezuelan</a> clients, for his role in a scheme to wash funds from the Venezuelan national oil company through the exchange rate system. Providing evidence as part of his plea deal, Krull implicated Raul Gorr\u00edn, the man responsible for turning opposition media network Globovisi\u00f3n into pro-Maduro outlet and three sons-in-law of the president.

But in the wake of the Panama Papers scandal it has become increasingly hard to launder money through the country, cutting off a potential exit route for those looking to cut loose from Maduro\u2019s embattled regime. \u201cThe Panamanian real estate boom began in 2005 \u2013 the Colombians came first, then the Venezuelans,\u201d says Ernesto Gonzalez, an investment advisor for Dproperty, a local property broker. \u201cThey would sometimes buy up seven or eight luxury apartments in the same building and leave them vacant but the market has slowed dramatically in recent years, especially after the Panama Papers.\u201d The April 2016 publication of 11 million documents taken from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca shed light on the mechanisms by which Chavistas built their wealth. As part of the Panama Papers investigation Venezuelan journalists Ewald Scharfenburg and Alfredo Meza sifted through hundreds of thousands of documents relating to more than 700 of their compatriots. \u201cCh\u00e1vez, with good reason, was suspicious of the country\u2019s traditional business elite, so he created a new one,\u201d says Scharfenburg. \u201cThrough its government connections the new elite amassed huge fortunes, both by over-billing state entities and through preferential access to dollars, which became a huge opportunity for self-enrichment.\u201d In 2003 Ch\u00e1vez pegged the bolivar, the national currency, to the US dollar. As the bolivar devalued in real terms, huge arbitrage options opened up for individuals and companies who could buy dollars at the official rate and sell them on the black market, often at over 100 times their purchase value. With a dollarized economy, visa-free travel and a financial sector with a habit of turning a blind eye, Panama \u2013 along with Miami, Spain and Nicaragua \u2013 became a favourite destination for offshore investment and, for a while, the boligburgues could lead their often ostentatious retirements undisturbed. Juan Guaid\u00f3 \u2013 the opposition leader leader now recognized as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate leader by dozens of western governments \u2013 has offered amnesty to Venezuelan soldiers who defect. US security adviseer John Bolton has suggested that Maduro and his inner circle should take \u201ca long, quiet retirement \u2026 on a nice beach somewhere far from Venezuela.\u201d But the boliburgues can be forgiven for not taking Bolton at his word. Senior Panamanian sources told The Guardian that since early 2017 the US\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) had been working with the Lima Group of 12 Latin American countries and Canada to identify illegal offshore assets belonging to members of the Maduro regime. In November Miami courts ruled that Alejandro Andrade, Chavez\u2019s private secretary turned head of treasury, had accepted $1bn in bribes for providing access to preferential currency rates as part of a money laundering scam. He received a 10-year sentence and his Florida mansion, collection of classic cars and 17 racehorses are to be auctioned by the US treasury. \u201cThe Andrade case was an inflection point,\u201d says Scharfenburg. \u201cIt was assumed he had done a deal with US authorities to escape prosecution. Since 2016, the US\u2019s approach has changed, the boliburgues know they are under vigilance and they are increasingly trying to move their cash to places like Turkey and the UAE.\u201d In October federal courts also gave a 10-year sentence to Matthias Krull, a Panama-based banker who allegedly managed accounts for 500 Venezuelan clients, for his role in a scheme to wash funds from the Venezuelan national oil company through the exchange rate system. Providing evidence as part of his plea deal, Krull implicated Raul Gorr\u00edn, the man responsible for turning opposition media network Globovisi\u00f3n into pro-Maduro outlet and three sons-in-law of the president. US prosecutors unsealed an indictment against Gorr\u00edn for money-laundering and bribery in November. In a separate case uncovered by the Panama Papers investigation, Spanish authorities arrested Claudia Patricia D\u00edaz Guill\u00e9n and her husband Adr\u00edan Vel\u00e1squez. He had been employed as Chavez\u2019s bodyguard while she had been his personal nurse before replacing Andrade as head of treasury in 2011. The pair are accused of pocketing over $4bn through an exotic blend of Seychelles listed shell companies and Andorran banks. Diaz Guill\u00e9n and Vel\u00e1squez claim the case against them is politically motivated. In Panama, authorities are cooperating with FinCEN and working hard to clean up a reputation left tarnished by the Panama Papers. On 6 February the country introduced tougher penalties for tax evasion. \u201cThe environment has changed significantly,\u201d says Dulcidio de la Guardia, Minister of Finance from 2014 to July 2018. \u201cPanama has worked hard to introduce a world class anti-money laundering framework and it is far harder for both local and foreigners to open bank accounts.\u201d Since 2016 Panama\u2019s banks have ceased to open accounts to individuals with companies listed in Venezuela due to concerns about exposure to possible corruption. As authorities in the US, Panama and Spain home in on the Chavistas\u2019 errant billions, those close to the regime are running out of time to secure their foreign assets. In any future rebuilding of the Venezuelan economy a strong emphasis is likely to be put on recovering stolen assets according to Pedro Armada, a Panama City based investigator and forensic accountant. \u201cAs Venezuela enters \u2018end-game\u2019 we are likely to see an acceleration in the rate at which ill-gotten funds are expatriated,\u201d says Armada. \u201cThe noose is tightening on the boliburgues.\u201d",

This fact is bluntly stated as being a problem in the introduction of the report rather than the conclusion, but it is worth looking beyond these headline figures. What do reports like this really tell us?</p> \n<p>Who attends university, and which university they attend, is a question that captures commentators and policymakers, for reasons that are related to but not fundamentally about education. Universities are both pathways and gateways. They can help train you to get somewhere new, but they also work to make sure that only the right sort of people get into positions of power. These functions overlap, but aren\u2019t the same.</p> \n<p>You can see the tension when we talk about, for instance, the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/03/polytechnics-became-universities-1992-differentiation\" title=\"\">less prestigious post-1992 universities</a>\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/may/10/universityguide-sheffield-hallam-uni\" title=\"\">Sheffield Hallam</a> is noted for taking on the highest numbers of students from what are called \u201clow-participation neighbourhoods\u201d or LPNs, but what\u2019s wrong with Sheffield Hallam? We are forever talking about the role of universities as providing \u201cpreparation for the world of work\u201d, but there is little discussion of the divide between the kind of work the majority of students are preparing for and the kind of work the people who make policy want them to do. Doing a nursing degree at Teesside, which comes third on the list of universities with students from LPNs, is a pretty good route into the NHS. But if you want to head into a life of talking about or making decisions about the way we train, pay and employ nurses you\u2019re better off going doing something like PPE at Oxford or modern history at Cambridge.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/feb/05/denying-loans-to-students-with-weaker-a-levels-will-penalise-poor-families\">Denying loans to students with weaker A-levels will \u2018penalise poor families\u2019</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Previous conversations have focused on getting more \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/10/white-working-class-boys-in-england-need-more-help-to-go-to-university\" title=\"\">white working-class</a>\u201d students into classics at Oxford rather than asking why someone doing architectural technology at Liverpool John Moores is never going to be the housing minister. Similarly, it may be worth asking what underpins the push to get more people from less privileged backgrounds into university, rather than asking why going to university is regarded as a panacea. After all, these \u201clow-participation neighbourhoods\u201d are also the \u201cpost-industrial communities\u201d whose cultural identities are tied up with the loss of mining or manufacturing. Is a university education really an answer to this problem?</p> \n<p>Nor does it help that we cannot separate the role that the university system has in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/aug/15/government-accused-of-total-failure-to-widen-elite-university-access\" title=\"\">perpetuating the class system</a> from its role in enabling working-class people to move away from their backgrounds \u2013 an expectation that middle-class families do not reckon with in deciding whether their children should attend university.</p> \n<p>If your children get a degree, they\u2019re likely to move away \u2013 they don\u2019t bring their new petrochemical engineering skills back to your hometown, because there aren\u2019t the job opportunities. Even if higher education did work as a flawless pipeline for social mobility, there would be an emptying-out effect. And then what happens to the people who, for whatever reason, never got those degrees?</p> \n<p>A solution that relies on a proportion of individuals being granted the capability of getting away and moving up will never be a real solution. It\u2019s no surprise that negative attitudes and parental fears of \u201closing\u201d their children figured highly among the barriers to attendance cited in the report.</p> \n<p>What if you feel as if you\u2019re choosing between building a life close to your family and building a career?

The fact that specifically white working-class communities are underrepresented can lead commentators down some dubious paths. It\u2019s only a short error of reasoning to \u201cthese Asians are hardworking and that\u2019s why they get on, not like the lumpen whites\u201d.

      "bodyText": "At half of England\u2019s universities, fewer than 5% of students are classified as being from disadvantaged white backgrounds, according to a new report from the National Education Opportunities Network (Neon). This fact is bluntly stated as being a problem in the introduction of the report rather than the conclusion, but it is worth looking beyond these headline figures. What do reports like this really tell us? Who attends university, and which university they attend, is a question that captures commentators and policymakers, for reasons that are related to but not fundamentally about education. Universities are both pathways and gateways. They can help train you to get somewhere new, but they also work to make sure that only the right sort of people get into positions of power. These functions overlap, but aren\u2019t the same. You can see the tension when we talk about, for instance, the \u201cless prestigious post-1992 universities\u201d. Sheffield Hallam is noted for taking on the highest numbers of students from what are called \u201clow-participation neighbourhoods\u201d or LPNs, but what\u2019s wrong with Sheffield Hallam? We are forever talking about the role of universities as providing \u201cpreparation for the world of work\u201d, but there is little discussion of the divide between the kind of work the majority of students are preparing for and the kind of work the people who make policy want them to do. Doing a nursing degree at Teesside, which comes third on the list of universities with students from LPNs, is a pretty good route into the NHS. But if you want to head into a life of talking about or making decisions about the way we train, pay and employ nurses you\u2019re better off going doing something like PPE at Oxford or modern history at Cambridge. Previous conversations have focused on getting more \u201cwhite working-class\u201d students into classics at Oxford rather than asking why someone doing architectural technology at Liverpool John Moores is never going to be the housing minister. Similarly, it may be worth asking what underpins the push to get more people from less privileged backgrounds into university, rather than asking why going to university is regarded as a panacea. After all, these \u201clow-participation neighbourhoods\u201d are also the \u201cpost-industrial communities\u201d whose cultural identities are tied up with the loss of mining or manufacturing. Is a university education really an answer to this problem? Nor does it help that we cannot separate the role that the university system has in perpetuating the class system from its role in enabling working-class people to move away from their backgrounds \u2013 an expectation that middle-class families do not reckon with in deciding whether their children should attend university. If your children get a degree, they\u2019re likely to move away \u2013 they don\u2019t bring their new petrochemical engineering skills back to your hometown, because there aren\u2019t the job opportunities. Even if higher education did work as a flawless pipeline for social mobility, there would be an emptying-out effect. And then what happens to the people who, for whatever reason, never got those degrees? A solution that relies on a proportion of individuals being granted the capability of getting away and moving up will never be a real solution. It\u2019s no surprise that negative attitudes and parental fears of \u201closing\u201d their children figured highly among the barriers to attendance cited in the report. What if you feel as if you\u2019re choosing between building a life close to your family and building a career? Or what if you want to leave but feel as if doing so would be letting the side down? Unpicking these attitudes is complex, especially when we throw ethnicity into the mix. The fact that specifically white working-class communities are underrepresented can lead commentators down some dubious paths. It\u2019s only a short error of reasoning to \u201cthese Asians are hardworking and that\u2019s why they get on, not like the lumpen whites\u201d. Similarly, we see libertarian speculators from the Spiked or Spectator set arguing that the imbalance proves that there\u2019s no such thing as racism except against white people. It is difficult, especially when everyone doing the analysis has gone to Balliol rather than Salford, to get to grips with the way the particular histories of place, especially places that have undergone recent economic upheaval, can create negative attitudes. It is to be expected that migrant parents will have different expectations of their children than those in post-industrial communities that are \u201cleft behind\u201d, regardless of ethnicity, simply because of local experiences and history. But at the same time we should not look to this as a full explanation, nor see the solution as being yet more \u201cengagement\u201d programmes to persuade people from these places that they just have to sort their attitudes out. The focus on individual rather than systemic solutions permeates too much of our debate on this issue, in terms of framing both the problems and acceptable solutions. The social issues caused by the closure of factories and steel mills cannot be solved by simply getting more children of factory and steel workers into higher education, especially if the net result is to empty out these towns and leave them older, poorer and sicker than before.

More than one league can occupy each tier. NISA, for example, is applying to join Division 3, the same tier as USL\u2019s League One. It hopes to cater to clubs that bristle at the USL\u2019s central control and its partnership with MLS. What division a team in doesn\u2019t necessarily tell the story of how big they are though. Detroit City FC, <a href=\"http://www.kenn.com/the_blog/?p=9979\">who average more than 5,000 fans per game</a>, are in the same tier as a UPSL regional group that takes place entirely within a single city park.</p> <p><strong>So no one outside the three pro divisions can be professional?</strong></p> <p>Actually, professional teams can play below Division 3, though they\u2019re rare.</p> <p><strong>Then what would stop an entire league from declaring itself professional?</strong></p> <p>Here\u2019s where it gets (even more) complicated, and here\u2019s where the Cosmos enter the picture.

But most of these clubs, apart from the ones in the Founders Cup, aren\u2019t planning to turn professional, at least not in the near future. The UPSL has a few ambitious clubs, but its status as a low-budget, low-travel alternative is the key to its rapid expansion.

But as far back as the 1930s, the Academy was wrestling with how best to recognise \u201ccartoons\u201d. Having been nominated solely for a best music score award at the 10th Academy Awards in 1938, Disney\u2019s groundbreaking gem made a return appearance at the next Oscar ceremony, where Shirley Temple presented Walt with an honorary award (one full-size statuette and seven miniatures) for \u201ca significant screen innovation which has charmed millions and pioneered a great new entertainment field\u201d.</p> <h2>A Matter of Life and Death<strong>,</strong> 1947</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b2152ed3ea815bfe785717c68201e7658a4c724\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b2152ed3ea815bfe785717c68201e7658a4c724/0_45_2866_1720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marius Goring, David Niven, Roger Livesey, Kim Hunter and Robert Coote in A Matter of Life and Death.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Left to right: Marius Goring, David Niven, Roger Livesey, Kim Hunter and Robert Coote in A Matter of Life and Death.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Powell and Pressburger\u2019s glittering wartime fantasia ranks among the greatest films ever made, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/04/war-love-and-wierdness-a-matter-of-life-and-death-70-years-on\">a shimmering jewel in the crown of British cinema</a> that deftly straddles the divide between this world and the next. Yet like David Niven\u2019s doomed pilot, it got lost in the mist, Oscar-wise, dropping under the Academy\u2019s radar and earning zero nominations. In the US, the film was released under the title <em>Stairway to Heaven</em> because the Americans apparently didn\u2019t want to see anything with the word \u201cdeath\u201d in the title.

But as far back as the 1930s, the Academy was wrestling with how best to recognise \u201ccartoons\u201d. Having been nominated solely for a best music score award at the 10th Academy Awards in 1938, Disney\u2019s groundbreaking gem made a return appearance at the next Oscar ceremony, where Shirley Temple presented Walt with an honorary award (one full-size statuette and seven miniatures) for \u201ca significant screen innovation which has charmed millions and pioneered a great new entertainment field\u201d. A Matter of Life and Death, 1947 Powell and Pressburger\u2019s glittering wartime fantasia ranks among the greatest films ever made, a shimmering jewel in the crown of British cinema that deftly straddles the divide between this world and the next. Yet like David Niven\u2019s doomed pilot, it got lost in the mist, Oscar-wise, dropping under the Academy\u2019s radar and earning zero nominations. In the US, the film was released under the title Stairway to Heaven because the Americans apparently didn\u2019t want to see anything with the word \u201cdeath\u201d in the title. Really. Vertigo, 1959 Eyebrows were raised in 2012 when Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s sublimely weird chiller displaced Citizen Kane from the top spot of Sight &amp; Sound magazine\u2019s august poll of the greatest movies ever made. Yet neither picture was considered the pinnacle of achievement by the Academy, with Citizen Kane losing out to How Green Was My Valley in 1941\u2019s best picture race, while in 1959 Vertigo earned nominations only for art direction and sound. 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1969 Stanley Kubrick\u2019s interplanetary epic may have changed the face of modern cinema, but its Oscar triumphs were limited to a special visual effects award in 1969. Indeed, 2001 wasn\u2019t even nominated in the best picture category, with the Academy apparently finding more merit in Romeo and Juliet; Rachel, Rachel; The Lion in Winter; Funny Girl and top prize winner Oliver!. Kubrick was nominated for best director, but despite being regarded as one of the most important film-makers of the 20th century, like Hitchcock and Welles, he never won that award. The Exorcist, 1974 When Jonathan Demme\u2019s The Silence of the Lambs won best picture in 1991, it was hailed as the first horror film to take the top prize (although some would argue that it\u2019s actually a psychological thriller with added cannibalism). Yet the big daddy of horror earned only two Oscars, for sound and adapted screenplay, losing out in the best picture category to George Roy Hill\u2019s The Sting. Director William Friedkin had triumphed two years earlier with The French Connection, ensuring his place in the history books. But The Exorcist remains a superior work, regularly voted the scariest film ever made. ET the Extra-Terrestrial, 1983 The tale of a young boy whose parents have separated and who finds solace in the company of a lonely space alien, this sentimental sci-fi gem (which rivals the tear-jerking power of Silent Running) is arguably Spielberg\u2019s most personal work. It was the highest grossing film at the time, outselling Star Wars, and stamping itself upon the hearts of all who watched in rapturous wonder. Nominated for nine Oscars, it was beaten to best picture by Gandhi, whose director, Richard Attenborough, later stated, very graciously, that ET should have won. Trainspotting, 1997 Danny Boyle\u2019s incendiary adaptation of Irvine Welsh\u2019s novel is an era-defining work, a film that captured and shaped a moment of popular culture history. As such, it was exactly the kind of cutting-edge work the Academy tends to ignore. But screenwriter John Hodge earned a well-deserved nomination for turning Welsh\u2019s scorching prose into quotable screen gold, negotiating a thin line between humour and horror. At the 69th Oscars, the best picture award went to Anthony Minghella\u2019s The English Patient. Choose life, indeed! We Need to Talk About Kevin, 2012 Lionel Shriver\u2019s electrifying novel of maternal guilt and \u201cbad seed\u201d violence was brilliantly brought to the screen by Lynne Ramsay, who made her name with the acclaimed Ratcatcher and the underrated Morvern Callar and who recently directed the jaw-dropping existential thriller You Were Never Really Here. Despite picking up Bafta and Golden Globe nominations, and boasting a career-best central performance by Tilda Swinton, We Need to Talk About Kevin was entirely overlooked by the Academy voters. Leave No Trace, 2019 My favourite film of 2018, Debra Granik\u2019s note-perfect tale of a father and daughter living off-grid in the Pacific north-west serves as yet another reminder that awards often ignore the most remarkable movies. Depressing, too, that in a year in which film-makers such as Granik, Lynne Ramsay, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, Marielle Heller and Josie Rourke were all eligible, the Academy has come up with yet another all-male list of best director contenders. No matter, Leave No Trace is pretty much perfect and its omission from the nominations is Oscar\u2019s loss.",

Those 50-over games will give Wyatt another target: having established herself as one of the world\u2019s top T20 players, she wants to do the same in ODIs. \u201cComing in at five or six, on a good day I\u2019ve got 15 overs to go, so it is kind of like a T20,\u201d she says. \u201cMy job probably will be to bat with intent from ball one, like I do in T20. The ball will be a bit older, more fielders out, but that\u2019s my goal: to be one of the best finishers in the world.\u201d After the last year or so, one would not doubt her.",

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government has waved through a motion calling on it to establish a disability royal commission, but blamed the states for its failure to start the inquiry immediately. Greens senator Jordon Steele-John responded with fury, accusing the government of a \u201cbare-faced lie\u201d that state sign-off was required and failing to give a clear commitment or timeline for setting up the inquiry. On the Monday of the last sitting week before the budget in April, the Morrison government averted opposition ambushes by agreeing in-principle to the disability inquiry and surrendering to an internal insurgency by the Nationals, who planned to support Labor amendments for small business access to justice. Coalition senators voted against or signalled opposition to both measures in the Senate on Thursday, despite Scott Morrison then claiming on Sunday that he never opposed the disability royal commission. On Monday, Morrison told the House of Representatives that although it would pass the disability motion, the government would need to \u201cwork through all the necessary issues to be able to do something positively in this area\u201d. Morrison noted that when it was considered by the Council of Australian Governments, the states and territories \u201cdid not indicate support for a royal commission \u2026 So these are hurdles that would have to be addressed\u201d. Morrison cited the attorney general Christian Porter\u2019s opinion that since disability care was previously run by the states, a royal commission \u201cwould require consultation and agreement with the states and likely letters patent from the states\u201d. Constitutional expert George Williams told Guardian Australia the government does not strictly require letters patent from the states although it may be wise to first seek their cooperation. Steele-John said Morrison had \u201cfailed to say the one thing that we needed to hear from him, which was that he would pick up the phone to state and territory ministers and solicit their report and call the royal commission\u201d. With Labor states Western Australia and Victoria already pledging their support on Monday, Steele-John said the politics had moved \u201chugely\u201d since Coag rejected the inquiry. \u201cWhich state premier or minister would oppose this now? Nobody\u2019s going to oppose this.\u201d Steele-John said the federal government was \u201ccovering the backsides\u201d of state governments which would be \u201con the hook for a lot of bloody money\u201d for redress for systemic abuse. Bill Shorten told the house he was \u201cvery persuaded\u201d of the need for a disability royal commission since it was a recommendation of a Senate inquiry in November 2015 and he noted Labor had advocated for one since May 2017. \u201cThe abuse and mistreatment of people with disability is Australia\u2019s hidden shame,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been on notice about the issues for a very long time.\u201d \u201cWe need to address what is the core reason why people with a disability suffer disproportionate abuse, neglect and violence. \u201cIt\u2019s because, as a nation, despite progress we might have made on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and other things, we still as a nation devalue people with disability.\u201d On Monday afternoon the House of Representatives passed a treasury bill loaded in the Senate with Labor amendments to allow small businesses to apply in court before launching major legal action to escape paying costs, even if they lose a competition law case against larger rivals. The measures were supported on Friday by Nationals MPs Barnaby Joyce, Keith Pitt and Andrew Broad \u2013 applying an irresistible pressure to the Morrison government to back down or risk losing a second substantive vote on a bill in a week. Earlier on Monday the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, confirmed the government would support the bill, despite the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, signalling opposition to the small business measures in the Senate on Thursday. Labor\u2019s shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, said it was a great day for small business but the government had supported the bill \u201cnot because [Morrison] believes in it but because he\u2019s a desperate prime minister who is desperate to avoid Nationals crossing the floor against him\u201d. Joyce took credit for the backdown, telling reporters that the Nationals had been fighting for the measure \u201cfor so long\u201d. \u201cSo often you\u2019ve seen farmers in the past have a just position against the major supermarkets but no capacity whatsoever to pay the legal fees that would be required to take it on,\u201d he said.",

I\u2019m unequivocal that what we\u2019re doing today is the right thing do. Of course, only the executive can implement a royal commission, we understand that. But what I would say to the government is this is a good step forward. </p> <p>But we need to provide a timeline and, yes, the states and territories need to provide their cooperation but it wouldn\u2019t be the first time that a state and territory has said no to a Commonwealth Government and the Commonwealth Government has still steamed ahead. </p> <p>I accept there needs to be some discussion - that\u2019s good - but I really think we\u2019re capable of allocating a budget or work out how much it costs. </p> <p>We\u2019ve allocated, if we form government, $26 million. But if the Government has a different view about a higher quantum, we\u2019re obviously not going to quibble with that. </p> <p>But what we\u2019ve made clear is that people with disability need to be at the to drawing up of the terms of reference. We get that. </p> <p>That\u2019s one reason why Labor has chosen to, whilst we put out principles, and we did two years ago, we want to hear the voiceless in this debate. I think this afternoon this is a good resolution. I\u2019m really pleased because I have a real passion and interest in helping people with disabilities. </p> <p>This is some way to give back. It has been on the books for too long, this proposition. I\u2019m very pleased we\u2019re doing it. But we do so on the basis that this is not about recognising a particular institution but people need to go through their historical experiences. But fundamentally, I, and Labor, are voting for this royal commission because it is the right thing to do, because the evidence says it is the right thing to do, it\u2019s been our stated policy for the best part of two years to do. </p> <p>But even beyond all of that, we must redefine Australia\u2019s relationship with Australians who live with disability, we\u2019ve got to re-value and re-evaluate our relationship. We have to recognise that while we\u2019re a nation who devalues people with disability, then we will never get to the root cause of violence and the prevention of violence, abuse and neglect. But this is a very good moment and I\u2019m very pleased to support it.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-18T05:14:13.753Z\">at 5.14am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c6a3affe4b03c0232352ae1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-18T04:59:00.166Z\">4.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Scott Morrison:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr Speaker, on Friday I received correspondence from Senator Steele-John which contained a draft terms of reference for the proposed royal commission into disability services and I thank him for doing so and I appreciate...the very detailed suggestions that he has been able to provide to us on this issue. They, of course, will be of assistance as we consider now this motion and move forward on this matter.</p> <p>I note his terms of reference seeks to look into the experiences, rightly I express, of people affected or indirectly affected of people in institutional, residential or other context.</p> <p>As the Attorney-General noted on the weekend, that a royal commission looking into past issues, backwards, around disability care is essentially a royal commission that would look into state facilities and, at the very least, require consultation with the states and likely letters patents from the states. We understand this to be true.</p> <p>This should not be a royal commission that only looks at a narrow area of responsibility that has only become part of the Commonwealth\u2019s responsibility in recent times.</p> <p>The issues that are relevant here go back over some period of time. Certainly back a decade. And they, principally, involve the conduct of state and territory governments in the delivery of disability services. And they should, obviously, be considered in any royal commission that was held into this area.</p> <p>I do note, as I did in Question Time today, though, that the establishment of a royal commission was previously discussed through the Council of Australian Government and the COAG Disability Reform Council and, at that time, states and territories did not support, did not indicate support for a royal commission.</p> <p>So these are hurdles that would have to be addressed. I want to keep all Australians safe, Mr Speaker, and to use whatever powers we have to do so. But this work often requires us to work in partnership with the states and territories and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll have to address ourselves to going forward.</p> <p>Violence, abuse and neglect of people with disability outside service settings such as at home or in the community is mostly covered under state and territory law.</p> <p>So working with the states and territories in this area, both looking at matters in the past as well as looking forward, will be absolutely essential. So I will be seeking further advice from all states and territories to discuss this important matter of establishing a royal commission as well as consulting directly and extensively with stakeholders about what the precise terms of reference might be, and what other royal commissions, in particular the aged care royal commission, might be able to offer as a way to address these issues.</p> <p>These are the options before the government. As the House knows, calling a royal commission is a matter for the executive government. The House, as the Senate, has put forward a motion and it will not be opposed by the government, it will be supported by the government, but it will be the government that then will take that matter into consideration and work through all the necessary issues to be able to do something positively in this area and to act on these issues.</p> <p>That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ll do. We have no interest, Mr Speaker, in making any partisanship of this issue.</p> <p>One of the reasons I decided to establish the royal commission into aged care is I believe the royal commission into aged care would provide a fact base, a new platform, to support a further decade of bipartisan in action on aged care because I was concerned that that bipartisanship was waning.</p> <p>I sincerely hope that that is not the case in relation to the disability care and to go forward with this issue, that is the good faith I seek to go forward with this issue.</p> <p>I\u2019ll report back to the House when I have further advice and able to make announcements. With that I move that the resolution of the Senate be agreed to.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-18T05:16:22.426Z\">at 5.16am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c6a3949e4b022557d246d77\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-18T04:49:18.685Z\">4.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Birmo/status/1097357244490895360\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/estimates?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#estimates</a> caused me to miss what I hear was a quality valedictory by my SA colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KateEllisMP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@KateEllisMP</a>.

In this context, I\u2019d like to make to direct comments about Asio and officers. Firstly, Asio does not and will not use its position to influence the national debate on security relevant issues through unauthorised disclosures. I have the greatest confidence that Asio officers work with integrity and do not leak information to 3rd parties, as has been repeatedly implied in the media. Second, Asio does not finalise policy or provide running public commentary on the effectiveness of policy proposals. These are important considerations because they go to the trust that the parliament and ultimately the Australian people have in the effectiveness of their security service and the confidence that they have in Asio. I scarcely need to remind senators of the important limitations placed on intelligence services in successful democracies such as ours.</p> <p> <strong>When reporting wrongly attributes advice from Asio, or our classified advice is leaked, it undermines all that we stand for. </strong>I want to make this point, as it is often difficult for me as the director-general of security to correct the public record. We do not want to enter into a running commentary upon every reporting error. Asio\u2019s advice is provided agencies to assist with policy development, and there are strict controls on how that advice is managed and disseminated, and breakdown of these controls are seriously damaging.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-18T04:02:35.257Z\">at 4.02am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c6a2c33e4b022557d246d1c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-18T03:53:29.306Z\">3.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cI\u2019m asked if there are any alternative approaches, Mr Speaker....\u201d</p> <p>Due to personal reasons, I am going to run screaming from this building.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c6a2b42e4b03c0232352a6e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-18T03:51:21.515Z\">3.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mark Butler to Scott Morrison, </strong>asking why the PM is refusing to put his so-called big stick legislation before the House.</p> <p><strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong> takes this one, saying that the Coalition believes in lower power prices and asking why Labor is on the side of big energy companies.</p> <p>Etc, etc, etc<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-18T03:55:28.959Z\">at 3.55am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c6a2aabe4b022557d246d18\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-18T03:47:18.121Z\">3.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Liberal senator <strong>Jane Hume </strong>has been fishing for Asio director <strong>Duncan Lewis </strong>to criticise the provisions of the medevac bill, particularly the provision that gives the minister 72 hours to block a medical transfer on security grounds.<br></p> <p>Lewis and home affairs department secretary <strong>Michael Pezzullo </strong>both specified that they briefed Labor on the Senate bill (ie when the timeframe was 24 hours, not 72 hours).<br></p> <p>Lewis said it \u201cdepends on the circumstances\u201d how quickly the agency can do a background check. <br></p> <p>Hume suggests the medevac bill is unworkable, but Lewis clarifies that\u2019s not what he said.</p> <p>Asked if background checks could potentially take months, Lewis agreed \u201csometimes it could, indeed\u201d.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-18T03:51:30.498Z\">at 3.51am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c6a29ede4b0bdb6048fdc60\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-18T03:46:35.773Z\">3.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Andrew Leigh to Scott Morrison: </strong>(he is very loud)</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Last week the government voted against Labor access to justice for small business reforms in the Senate.

Keeping Australians safe is not a political slogan. It is the highest priority of every political party and every member of this place. </p> <p>So, obviously, the attempted hacking of the Parliament House network is a source of grave concern to us all. </p> <p>Over the past few years, we have witnessed a range of attempted infiltrations and manipulations in the democratic processes of Germany, Japan, to Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the United States, France and Canada.<br></p> <p>We cannot be complacent and, as this most recent activity reported by the prime minister indicates, we are not exempt or immune. </p> <p>Now, as the prime minister has indicated, government institutions, such as our Electoral Commissions, are largely well protected, but our party political structures perhaps are more vulnerable. </p> <p>We have seen overseas that it is progressive parties that are more likely to be targeted by ultra-rightwing organisations. </p> <p>Political parties are small organisations with only a few full-time staff, they collect, store and use large amounts of information about voters and communities. </p> <p>These institutions can be a soft target and our national approach to cyber security needs to pay more attention to non-government organisations. </p> <p>Our agencies shouldn\u2019t just be providing advice to political parties, but actively assisting in their defence. I have to say today to people listening in Parliament that my words are not just about political parties, but for Australia\u2019s small and medium businesses, our educational institutions and individuals. </p> <p>Everything that depends on internet technology, even if it is not actively connected to the global internet at all times is part of cyberspace. Cyberspace is a fully functioning reality. It is an ecosystem. </p> <p>The virtual world of cyberspace has created an ecosystem. </p> <p>New domains of human experience and millions of community within it that mimic the real world. It is an eco-system that has generated prosperity, and profound benefits to millions. It is an eco-system that also has spawned multiple threats to individuals, to businesses of all sizes, critical far, national security and our democratic systems. </p> <p>It is an echo-system that is growing rapidly each and every day. In 2015, it was estimated that 25bn devices were connected to the internet. That is eight times the number of people considered online. </p> <p>By 2020, the number of devices connected to the Internet is estimated to increase to 50bn devices. So the economy is no longer just merely enabled by cyber. Cyber is part of the economy and we are all connected in the economy. Cyber security affects every Australian in every way nearly every day. </p> <p>So we need every Australian equipped ... to protect our institutions, freedoms and values. It means improving awareness of cyber risks and strategies the guard against them. </p> <p>It means that we need to train up more Australians in our universities, TAFEs, research centres and our workplaces to fill national skill shortages and cyber security. </p> <p>In closing, I would say that I have great trust in our security agencies and their professionalism to do all that they can to protect our nation against cyber threats, but we constantly need to be asking ourselves our settings are right. </p> <p>The Commonwealth national cyber security adviser is dual in its policy role reporting to the secretary of home affairs that also is operational head of the Australian cyber security centre reporting to the director-general of the signals directorate.</p> <p>Some are concerned that this creates piping. We need a cohesive national approach through the cyber security centre as a single entity, responsible for managing the cyber mission in totality and reporting up there a single chain.</p> <p>We perhaps need to consider whether the Australian cyber security centre should be the single point of contact and accountability for all cyber-related communication, reporting, sin response, crisis communication, management, threat intelligent capability, operations and policy.</p> <p>This centre should remain based in the defence portfolio and continue to report to the director-general of the signals directorate.</p> <p>The threats we face in this field are always evolving and changing so we must continue to adapt and update our methods in defences because what we are defending, the integrity, transparency and health of our democracy, matters to every decision that we make in this place and every Australian that we serve.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-18T01:22:31.964Z\">at 1.22am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c6a04a7e4b03c023235299c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-18T01:06:24.282Z\">1.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Scott Morrison:</strong></p> <p>Australia\u2019s democratic process is our greatest asset: our most critical piece of national infrastructure.</p> <p>Public confidence in the integrity of our democratic processes is an essential element of Australian sovereignty and governance.</p> <p>While we will vigorously argue over many issues in this place, we are all united in our commitment to democratic principles.</p> <p>Members will be aware that the Australian Cyber Security Centre recently identified a malicious intrusion into the Australian Parliament House computer network. </p> <p>During the course of this work, we also became aware that the networks of some political parties - Liberal, Labor and the Nationals - have also been affected.</p> <p>Our security agencies have detected this activity and acted decisively to confront it.

He says the AFP stayed silent to give Al-Araibi\u2019s the best chance of a safe return. <strong>He then points to the actions of Home Affairs. </strong></p> <p>\u201cAs the committee would know, the AFP hosts the Australian-Interpol national central bureau and AFP staff are seconded to the NCB. On the 8th of November 2018 at the request of Bahrain, Interpol issued a red notice for Mr Al-Araibi, which AFP conveyed to the Australian Border Force of the 9th of November.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a routine process as many names come on and off Interpol watch lists regularly. At this time, neither the AFP nor the Australian-Interpol national central bureau was aware of Mr Al-Araibi\u2019s visa status. This was not known until after his detention in Thailand.</p> <p>\u201cNeither the AFP or the Australian-Interpol NCB can access visa information. We rely on notifications from the Home Affairs department. The Home Affairs department provided Mr Al-Araibi\u2019s visa status to the AFP on the 28th of November, the day after his detention in Thailand. On 29 November, the AFP sought and was granted permission by the Department of Home Affairs to refer Mr Al-Araibi\u2019s visa status to Interpol\u2019s office of legal affairs on the 29th of November.</p> <p>\u201cInterpol removed the notice within 24 hours of the AFP\u2019s provision of this information. The red notice was rescinded on 1 December Australian and Thailand time, which was the 30th of November France time. I cam confident that at all times the Australian-Interpol NCB adhered to the policies and procedures of Interpol. </p> <p>\u201c<strong>The Home Affairs portfolio has undertaken a number of reviews to establish a chronology of actions with a view to improving information exchange and reducing the risk of similar cases in the future.</strong>\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-17T23:15:14.284Z\">at 11.15pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c69e55fe4b022557d246bb4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-17T22:53:22.666Z\">10.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ray Hadley</strong> is going back to 2001.</p> <p>He talks about how <strong>John Howard</strong> was down in the polls, but then mentions the Tampa incident in August.

So these were my priorities. </p> <p>We need to do everything we can to support Australians with a disability. And I\u2019m disappointed that on Thursday the Labor party chose to play politics with this issue. There was no suggestion that the government was not going to support that motion that afternoon in the House of Representatives and the motion was not going to even come to the House of Representatives that afternoon.

Given the affirmative, he says fantastic and continues. The lights have gone out in the chamber. The Home Affairs department has put up a statement on its website about the Paladin tender: Paladin Group is a global company which has delivered security and related services to a broad range of government and private sector clients across the Asia-Pacific region since 2007. It has been operating in Papua New Guinea (PNG) since 2009 via its PNG entity, Paladin Solutions PNG Ltd. Paladin Holdings PTE Ltd registered in Singapore, is the parent company of Paladin Solutions PNG Ltd (registered in PNG). On 21 September 2017 Paladin Solutions PNG Ltd was engaged under Letters of Intent valued at$89,243,817.76 (AusTender). This allowed the commencement of transition activities and continuity of service delivery to support the closure of the Manus Regional Processing Centre by 31 October 2017, and allowed for contract negotiations. On 28 February 2018, the Department signed the initial PNG Services Contract (the Contract) withPaladin Holdings PTE Ltd valued at $176,876,834.40 for Garrison and Security Services at the East Lorengau Refugee Transit Centre, as well as services at other sites including Hillside Haus, West Lorengau Haus and in Port Moresby, PNG. On 17 September 2018, the Contract was extended to 31 December 2018. On 3 December 2018, the Contract was extended to 30 June 2019. The Contract for the period from 28 February 2018 to 30 June 2019 is valued at $333,546,146.40(AusTender). The procurement of Paladin Solutions PNG Ltd/Paladin Holdings PTE Ltd was conducted under the Special Measures procurement designated in accordance with paragraph 2.6 of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules. In applying this Special Measure key factors were taken into consideration including: the urgency of ongoing services to support PNG Immigration and Citizenship Authority and the US Resettlement process and other service providers including Pacific International Hospital, Port Moresby; the limited number of potential suppliers (based on previous attempts to procure similar services); and the remote operating environment. The procurement complied with other requirements under Division 1, in particular Value for Money, Records, Efficient, effective, economical and ethical procurement, and Procurement Risk. This procurement also complied with the Department\u2019s High Risk, High Value governance process, which includes additional governance oversight such as Deputy Secretary or Deputy Commissioner financial approval, and clearance of key documents at senior executive level. External probity advisors, external legal advisors from AGS, and commercial and financial advisors were also engaged during the procurement process. The Department administers a strict contractual Performance Management Framework to ensure that Paladin Holdings PTE Ltd is accountable and delivers services to refugees and non-refugees as per the contractual requirements. This includes monitoring Paladin\u2019s performance and undertaking a User Acceptance Testing process of Paladin Holdings PTE Ltd to ensure their contractual compliance. A copy of the Paladin Holdings PTE Ltd PNG Services Contract (7MB PDF) (which only removed commercial in confidence information) was made publically available on the Department\u2019s FOI disclosure log on 16 August 2018. Victorian senator Derryn Hinch asks Mike Pezzullo whether Peter Dutton, the home affairs minister, has a relative working at Paladin. \u201cI have no idea,\u201d Pezzullo tells the committee. Hinch wonders whether he\u2019ll look into it. Pezzullo hedges. \u201cIf it falls into my responsibilities,\u201d he says. He then tells the committee (as he did earlier) that Dutton had nothing to do with this tender, apart from confirming the government\u2019s policy regarding offshore detention at Manus Island. The environment minister Melissa Price has upgraded the threatened status of the spectacled flying fox, whose populations suffered mass losses during the recent Queensland heatwave. Humane Society International, which has criticised the government for delaying decisions about threatened species protection, had nominated the species to have its listing status changed to reflect the declines. Speaking today, Price said it was necessary to transfer the species\u2019 status from vulnerable to endangered because its population had halved in the past decade and it was \u201cheavily impacted by a recent heat stress event in Queensland\u201d. Price said the government was also moving to implement recovery plans for the brush-tailed rabbit-rat and the central rock rat. \u201cAny uplisting is concerning to me, but I have tremendous faith in the science and planning that goes into monitoring and supporting our environment, its flora and fauna, and in the strength of these plans in protecting our native species,\u201d she said. GetUp is not an associated entity, the AEC has found: In his statement, Paul Oosting sounds pretty happy with the decision: \u201cThe AEC has declared that there is an important place for everyday people in our democracy. We put everyday people and what they want back at the centre of our politics.\u201d This is the third time hard right politicians have forced the AEC to investigate GetUp\u2019s independence and the third time the agency has ruled in GetUp\u2019s favour. \u201cThe Australian Electoral Commission has strongly rejected the push by the hard right faction of the Coalition to shut everyday people out of politics. \u201cThe hard right forced this expensive, two-year investigation on the GetUp movement, in the hope it would silence all one million of us. But it has done exactly the opposite. \u201cYou don\u2019t make our democracy stronger by penalising a grassroots organisation for talking to voters. \u201cToday sets an important precedent for independent grassroots campaigning in Australia.\u201d Lots of questions continuing on Paladin. The objective is to check whether basic probity protocols were followed. The secretary of the home affairs department, Mike Pezzullo, repeats the evidence about the department needing to move quickly given the tight timelines after the PNG government said they wouldn\u2019t provide services. He tells the committee there was a real possibility of no service provision on Manus at the end of October. The Greens senator Nick McKim interjects at this point, reminding people he was on Manus last year and there were no services. No meals. No services. Pezzullo and fellow officials are asked, given the timelines, wasn\u2019t there time to put this to a wider tender? Pezzullo tells the committee \u201cmy strong preference\u201d would have been to engage a service provider in a process running for 12 months or more, after a global search. He said that objective worked until PNG told the Australian government they would not provide the services. So you were desperate, the Labor senator Kim Carr editorialises. Pezzullo has a different construction. We were dealing with an urgent situation but we were never desperate in doing so. Feel the noise Sticking with Paladin. Home affairs officials also indicated that other companies did not want to tender for services on Manus Island because, as one put it, there was \u201ctoo much noise around regional processing\u201d. Jordon Steele -John: The prime minister failed to take the one step which would have brought joy and elation to disabled people, and that was to commit his government to call for a royal commission. He used a lot of big, kind words, but he failed to say the one thing that we needed to hear from him, which was that he would pick up the phone to state and territory ministers and solicit their report and call the royal commission. As the prime minister was leaving the chamber, I asked him to give us a clear timeline for the taking of those steps, and he said to me: \u2018I\u2019ve said what I said\u2019. Prime minister, that is not good enough. The disabled people of Australia, those who watch you in the gallery, deserve more, they deserve better. You must tell us immediately the timeline you intend to contact states and territories. You must call a royal commission. Annnnnnd Home affairs officials are now back in estimates being asked about the Paladin contract which has attracted a lot of attention over the past week or so because of diligent reporting by the Australian Financial Review. I\u2019ll just paraphrase the evidence to keep this ticking over briskly. The home affairs officials have told senators they went with Paladin in a direct source arrangement, as opposed to the more conventional open source tender, because the PNG government initially told the Australian government it would deliver services on Manus Island, and then advised the government in early July 2017 that it wasn\u2019t able to do so, because the government had entered a caretaker period. According to the version just given at estimates, home affairs officials then had to scramble to find a service provider. They sought advice from the finance department and the Australian government solicitor about what options they had. The resolution was to invoke a regulation 2.6 \u2013 which allowed the home affairs department to approach a provider directly rather than advertise more widely for service delivery. Officials said they had no choice but to move quickly because there was a hard deadline of October. The evidence this afternoon is Paladin was already on the scene in PNG, working as a contractor for Wilson Security. Officials say the contract is with Paladin based in Singapore, not a subsidiary headquartered at a beach shack at Kangaroo Island (which is what media reports have said in recent days). Officials have also told the committee this is a \u201cfull service\u201d contract, not just the provision of security (which I think is an attempt to explain why the arrangement is worth hundreds of millions). From Kate Ellis\u2019s valedictory: People with Disabilities Australia have responded to the motion for a royal commission into disability abuse passing in the parliament. \u201cWe welcome today\u2019s vote on a royal commission into the violence, abuse and neglect that is a devastating reality in many of our lives,\u201d said Therese Sands, co-chief executive of People with Disability Australia, a member of Disabled People\u2019s Organisations Australia. However, we are concerned that there was not a definite announcement or timeframe to establish a Royal Commission, nor a commitment to look at the breadth of issues we have raised with the Federal Government over many years. \u201cWe have fought for a standalone Royal Commission on this issue for decades and we are ready to work with the Federal Government to make the Royal Commission happen as soon as possible.\u201d Carolyn Frohmader, executive director of Women With Disabilities Australia, a member of DPO Australia, said: \u201cA royal commission is essential due to the violence that has impacted many of our lives, causing trauma, harm and even death. \u201cWomen with disability experience higher rates of violence, including sexual violence than non-disabled women. We need to make sure that the royal commission takes an intersectional approach to the examination of violence, including gender, age, sexual orientation, intersex status and race. \u201cThe specific issues that affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with disability must also be addressed by this Royal Commission, including extensive consultation with Aboriginal controlled organisations of people with disability, particularly given the over-representation of Aboriginal people in care, in prison and living in institutions. Damian Griffis, chief executive of First Peoples Disability Network Australia, (a member of DPO Australia), said: \u201cPeople with disability from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds must have equal access to the Royal Commission, with appropriate supports, translations to make sure our voices are heard. From Mike Bowers\u2019s lens to your eyeballs. The disability abuse royal commission motion passes on the voices. It\u2019s Paladin time in estimates, with Kim Carr beginning the questioning. Jordon Steele-John has ben live tweeting his reactions from the floor On the cost, the aged care royal commission has a budget of $130m, while I think the banking royal commission had a budget of around $75m. Bill Shorten: This is a very, you know, politically contested time in Australia\u2019s politics as we are in the 45th Parliament. [There was] debate last week about what was the right or wrong thing to do. I\u2019m unequivocal that what we\u2019re doing today is the right thing do. Of course, only the executive can implement a royal commission, we understand that. But what I would say to the government is this is a good step forward. But we need to provide a timeline and, yes, the states and territories need to provide their cooperation but it wouldn\u2019t be the first time that a state and territory has said no to a Commonwealth Government and the Commonwealth Government has still steamed ahead. I accept there needs to be some discussion - that\u2019s good - but I really think we\u2019re capable of allocating a budget or work out how much it costs. We\u2019ve allocated, if we form government, $26 million. But if the Government has a different view about a higher quantum, we\u2019re obviously not going to quibble with that. But what we\u2019ve made clear is that people with disability need to be at the to drawing up of the terms of reference. We get that. That\u2019s one reason why Labor has chosen to, whilst we put out principles, and we did two years ago, we want to hear the voiceless in this debate. I think this afternoon this is a good resolution. I\u2019m really pleased because I have a real passion and interest in helping people with disabilities. This is some way to give back. It has been on the books for too long, this proposition. I\u2019m very pleased we\u2019re doing it. But we do so on the basis that this is not about recognising a particular institution but people need to go through their historical experiences. But fundamentally, I, and Labor, are voting for this royal commission because it is the right thing to do, because the evidence says it is the right thing to do, it\u2019s been our stated policy for the best part of two years to do. But even beyond all of that, we must redefine Australia\u2019s relationship with Australians who live with disability, we\u2019ve got to re-value and re-evaluate our relationship. We have to recognise that while we\u2019re a nation who devalues people with disability, then we will never get to the root cause of violence and the prevention of violence, abuse and neglect. But this is a very good moment and I\u2019m very pleased to support it. Scott Morrison: Mr Speaker, on Friday I received correspondence from Senator Steele-John which contained a draft terms of reference for the proposed royal commission into disability services and I thank him for doing so and I appreciate...the very detailed suggestions that he has been able to provide to us on this issue. They, of course, will be of assistance as we consider now this motion and move forward on this matter. I note his terms of reference seeks to look into the experiences, rightly I express, of people affected or indirectly affected of people in institutional, residential or other context. As the Attorney-General noted on the weekend, that a royal commission looking into past issues, backwards, around disability care is essentially a royal commission that would look into state facilities and, at the very least, require consultation with the states and likely letters patents from the states. We understand this to be true. This should not be a royal commission that only looks at a narrow area of responsibility that has only become part of the Commonwealth\u2019s responsibility in recent times. The issues that are relevant here go back over some period of time. Certainly back a decade. And they, principally, involve the conduct of state and territory governments in the delivery of disability services. And they should, obviously, be considered in any royal commission that was held into this area. I do note, as I did in Question Time today, though, that the establishment of a royal commission was previously discussed through the Council of Australian Government and the COAG Disability Reform Council and, at that time, states and territories did not support, did not indicate support for a royal commission. So these are hurdles that would have to be addressed. I want to keep all Australians safe, Mr Speaker, and to use whatever powers we have to do so. But this work often requires us to work in partnership with the states and territories and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll have to address ourselves to going forward. Violence, abuse and neglect of people with disability outside service settings such as at home or in the community is mostly covered under state and territory law. So working with the states and territories in this area, both looking at matters in the past as well as looking forward, will be absolutely essential. So I will be seeking further advice from all states and territories to discuss this important matter of establishing a royal commission as well as consulting directly and extensively with stakeholders about what the precise terms of reference might be, and what other royal commissions, in particular the aged care royal commission, might be able to offer as a way to address these issues. These are the options before the government. As the House knows, calling a royal commission is a matter for the executive government. The House, as the Senate, has put forward a motion and it will not be opposed by the government, it will be supported by the government, but it will be the government that then will take that matter into consideration and work through all the necessary issues to be able to do something positively in this area and to act on these issues. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ll do. We have no interest, Mr Speaker, in making any partisanship of this issue. One of the reasons I decided to establish the royal commission into aged care is I believe the royal commission into aged care would provide a fact base, a new platform, to support a further decade of bipartisan in action on aged care because I was concerned that that bipartisanship was waning. I sincerely hope that that is not the case in relation to the disability care and to go forward with this issue, that is the good faith I seek to go forward with this issue. I\u2019ll report back to the House when I have further advice and able to make announcements. With that I move that the resolution of the Senate be agreed to. The issue of the Paladin contract should be coming up in the Home Affairs estimates now-ish. The motion to bring on a royal commission into disability abuse has reached the House. The upshot of Scott Morrison\u2019s speech is that the government is looking at ways to look forward and consulting with the states and territories. The government will support the motion, but Morrison says the government will look at all the issues and how to move forward and will report back to the House. Which can only come in April, around the budget. Bill Shorten is now delivering his reply. Jordon Steele-John is once again on the floor as as guest from the Senate. You can hear Kate and David [Penberthy]\u2019s young sons, Sam and Charlie, in the public gallery as Kate delivers the final thank yous of her speech, which is directed towards her family. Her mum appears to be crying. Her kids are as impressed with proceedings as you would expect two toddlers to be. She makes it clear she is not leaving a job she loves because of them. \u201cI am leaving a job that I love for me, I am leaving because you have given me something more than I love than this [amazing job].\u201d Kate Ellis says \u201crestoring unity, allowing shadow ministers the space and trust to delve deep into policy development\u201d has been among her favourite moments of the Labor opposition, thanking Bill Shorten for pulling the party together after 2013. She also thanks Julia Gillard for her leadership. She thanks Tony Burke and Tanya Plibersek for their friendship, but also singles out chief whip Chris Hayes and his staff for helping her balance work and home life. And of course, a special thank you goes to Don Farrell, for the reason she was given the opportunity to serve her community. Thank yous also go to those who helped fight to establish a childcare centre at the parliament, and the staff who work there. Kate Ellis said she felt \u201ca great burden\u201d to show that women could be parliamentarians and have a family. She also says no male power structure is dismantled voluntarily. But she feels that change has happened within the Labor party and she feels that now she can leave, with more women coming through than ever. Julie Bishop is among the 22 or so government MPs who have remained to listen (as is Kelly O\u2019Dwyer and Melissa Price). All three women are listening intently. On the exchange between the home affairs boss, Mike Pezzullo, and the Liberal senator Jane Hume on the advice Bill Shorten and Labor received (particularly relevant given Peter Dutton\u2019s dixer answer earlier in question time): Pezzullo: \u201cJust to be abundantly clear, the director general and I did brief Mr Shorten and his very senior colleagues, on the Senate amended bill. \u201cThere was no discussion of, and nor were we able to as public officials, unless authorised by the government, to engage with the opposition, on what alternative constructions might look like. \u201c... So I think your question went to Labor\u2019s amendments?\u201d Hume: \u201cYes it did.\u201d Pezzullo: \u201cI want to be very clear about this, the briefing was about the Senate-amended bill. \u201c... As I made clear in my introduction , which was precisely designed to anticipate this line of questioning, the opposition in the Westminster system makes up its own mind which amendments to pursue, and I would infer, because it happened after our briefing, on the basis of that briefing Mr Lewis and I provided along with several of our colleagues. \u201cI want to stress again the briefing was on the Miscellaneous Measures Bill, as amended by the Senate.\u201d For those wondering, yes the motion for a royal commission into disability abuse has arrived from the Senate. The government will not be opposing it. Kate Ellis is delivering her valedictory to the House. She says when she started she said she was young and idealistic and she hoped that when she left she would be old and idealistic. Fifteen years later, she says that idealism has survived. \u201cJust.\u201d Scott Morrison calls time on QT. There\u2019s been a tense exchange between Labor senators, the environment department and Coalition senator Simon Birmingham over how Australia is tracking toward its 2030 emissions targets. Labor senators Anne Urquhart and Kristina Keneally asked about the department\u2019s most recent quarterly emissions projections, which say on current trajectories Australia\u2019s emissions will be 563 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030, which would be a 7% reduction in emissions on 2005 levels. Australia\u2019s target is for a 26-28% reduction on 2005 levels. The amount of emissions for 2018 was 534 million tonnes the department tells the hearing. Senator Urquhart wants to know if this means Australia\u2019s emissions are increasing (they are). But the department is arguing that it\u2019s not that simple. \u201cIt\u2019s always important for us to clarify that this is a projection. It\u2019s not a forecast of what is the potential to happen. I guess what I\u2019m saying is while it\u2019s a projection, it\u2019s very conservative,\u201d says Jo Evans, the deputy secretary for climate change and energy innovation. She says there are measures that the department hasn\u2019t yet factored into its projections that could close the gap further - basically changes in technology that could drive emissions down further, or changes in policy. But Urquhart wants to know if it\u2019s correct that, based on the department\u2019s own data now, Australia is set to miss its minimum 2030 target by 19%. \u201cThe only way that would be a true statement is if nothing else happened between now and then...which would be predicated on nothing further happening either in unexpected ways or in changes or amendments to the current policy suite.\u201d Keneally asks in what sense the government\u2019s current policies are working, to which Birmingham replies that they have \u201csteered\u201d Australia toward beating its 2020 target. Keneally asks if this means \u201chope\u201d is guiding the government\u2019s claims the country will meet its commitments under the Paris agreement. Birmingham says its confidence is based on Australia\u2019s performance under the Kyoto agreement and the government \u201ccontinually working\u201d on policy settings that will help Australia meet its Paris targets. \u201cSo if I could summarise, you\u2019re hoping that past performance is an indicator of future success and that future success will be predicated not on policies you\u2019ve already announced but on some things you\u2019ve yet to announce,\u201d Keneally says. We are going a bit longer into question time, so Bob Katter gets a question about help for farmers. He asks about the government-backed bank. I think. Scott Morrison touches on what Paul Karp reported on earlier about aid for flood-hit communities: Tonight I am assembling a cabinet task force to consider a series of recommendations and proposals we will work through over the course of the week. they will come off the back of my learning when I was up there last week, with the deputy prime minister who was here on the weekend and the assistant minister for home affairs who has been there.\u201d Amanda Rishworth to Melissa Price: There is an ecological disaster in the Murray-Darling River. Why is it that the environment minister has not visited and is completely missing in action. Price: It is indeed very disappointing at a time when many communities along the Murray-Darling basin are in a very distressed state, you should come to this place and politicise this. Very disappointing. We know the recent fish [kill] in the basin are a terrible reminder, of the devastating effects of drought on the environment. It is distressing for all those communities along there, and does highlight the importance of water for the environment, during the [drought] times.\u201d She ends by saying the Coalition are \u201ca team\u201d. Labor explodes as one. For more on Melissa Price\u2019s low-key performance as environment minister, check out this feature by our environment writer Lisa Cox: Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: (He is also very loud in asking this) Can the prime minister confirm he cannot control the Parliament, he cannot control the National party, cannot control his own government, and that today, he will 1) backflip on a disability royal commission, 2) backflip on access to justice laws for small business, and has already shelved his 11th energy policy. Morrison I can confirm this leader of the Labor party can\u2019t get his head out of the Canberra bubble. (That\u2019s not me cutting it down - that\u2019s the whole answer) Labor senators have probed Duncan Lewis\u2019 barbed opening statement and have successfully joined the dots back to Simon Benson\u2019s article in The Australian on the medevac bill. Lewis said that Asio gave advice that was \u201cnarrow\u201d in scope, relating only to the Asio Act and how it related to the Senate version of the medevac bill. \u201cIf the Australian has gone beyond that, then that is not correct,\u201d he said. Home affairs department security Michael Pezzullo clarified: The headline was Asio advice. But when one unpacked the article and read it, it said something like \u2018advice from home affairs, based on contributions from Asio [and Border Force]. That was the Benson article, if you read down the column it was transparently apparent it was from the department and drew on, in part, advice from Asio. Lewis confirms he checked and there was no leak from ASIO. Labor\u2019s Kim Carr asks if this is the sort of behaviour that undermines confidence in Asio (the misattribution of advice), and Lewis confirms: \u201cYes.\u201d Asio chief Duncan Lewis appears to have had a bit of a go about the leaking of its advice, in the opening statement to his estimates hearing: We recognise that our security intelligence advises unique and that it is only one important drawn on for a policy development advice. In this context, I\u2019d like to make to direct comments about Asio and officers. Firstly, Asio does not and will not use its position to influence the national debate on security relevant issues through unauthorised disclosures. I have the greatest confidence that Asio officers work with integrity and do not leak information to 3rd parties, as has been repeatedly implied in the media. Second, Asio does not finalise policy or provide running public commentary on the effectiveness of policy proposals. These are important considerations because they go to the trust that the parliament and ultimately the Australian people have in the effectiveness of their security service and the confidence that they have in Asio. I scarcely need to remind senators of the important limitations placed on intelligence services in successful democracies such as ours. When reporting wrongly attributes advice from Asio, or our classified advice is leaked, it undermines all that we stand for. I want to make this point, as it is often difficult for me as the director-general of security to correct the public record. We do not want to enter into a running commentary upon every reporting error. Asio\u2019s advice is provided agencies to assist with policy development, and there are strict controls on how that advice is managed and disseminated, and breakdown of these controls are seriously damaging. \u201cI\u2019m asked if there are any alternative approaches, Mr Speaker....\u201d Due to personal reasons, I am going to run screaming from this building. Mark Butler to Scott Morrison, asking why the PM is refusing to put his so-called big stick legislation before the House. Josh Frydenberg takes this one, saying that the Coalition believes in lower power prices and asking why Labor is on the side of big energy companies. Etc, etc, etc Liberal senator Jane Hume has been fishing for Asio director Duncan Lewis to criticise the provisions of the medevac bill, particularly the provision that gives the minister 72 hours to block a medical transfer on security grounds. Lewis and home affairs department secretary Michael Pezzullo both specified that they briefed Labor on the Senate bill (ie when the timeframe was 24 hours, not 72 hours). Lewis said it \u201cdepends on the circumstances\u201d how quickly the agency can do a background check. Hume suggests the medevac bill is unworkable, but Lewis clarifies that\u2019s not what he said. Asked if background checks could potentially take months, Lewis agreed \u201csometimes it could, indeed\u201d. Andrew Leigh to Scott Morrison: (he is very loud) Last week the government voted against Labor access to justice for small business reforms in the Senate. Today the government is briefing the media it is intending to backflip because Nationals are willing to cross the floor and vote for the Labor reforms. Isn\u2019t it the case this prime minister will say and do anything to desperately cling to power? Morrison: I will do everything in my power to support small and family businesses. This is the track record! Cut the tax rate to 25%, introduce legislation as we are doing this week under the securitisation funds to make sure small businesses can get access to the capital and finance they need. Making sure small businesses get paid on time, reducing the payment times to 20 days. Down from 30 and getting state and territory governments to back that as well as well as large businesses. This government has done more for small and family businesses than any other government. ...Time after time after time, when it comes to small and family businesses, they have a lot of friends in this parliament. They are only sitting on this side of the chamber. Nicole Flint is up with the next dixer, asking about how safe we are and what are the alternative approaches? Immigration minister David Coleman ramps it up with this: We know the Labor party\u2019s handling of this issue, with 50,000 people arriving, 8,000 children forcibly placed in detention, with 1,200 people drowning at sea, was the greatest postwar failure in Australian public policy history. Yup Brendan O\u2019Connor to Scott Morrison on the AWU leak case: Can he confirm two of his ministers refused to provide witness statements to the federal police investigation? Morrison: This is a matter before the courts I do not intend to provide any comment other than to remind the House what this matter is all about. Why did union fund money go to GetUp? This is going to be a long and very painful election campaign. In today\u2019s edition of How Safe Are Your Borders? Peter Dutton says: Under the Immigration Act it has 12 subsections, the Labor party has discounted 11 of those and included only one, that means we could stop somebody hopping on a plane in Singapore today accused of molesting a child, [pulled] that person from the plane and denied them access to our borders. But, we can\u2019t do that, with people coming from Manus and Nauru under the Labor law ... The reality is, as we have seen ... The House explodes: They say it\u2019s not true, they say it\u2019s not true! It is true, if you listen to the advice, if you had taken the advice from the security agencies you would know it is true. The trouble is you acted against the advice of the security agencies you are now paying the price. Mr Speaker, I can say to the house under Labor\u2019s law, we have no power to prevent the transfer of a man charged with the rape of a minor. No power under Labor law, to prevent the transfer of a man charged with an indecent act in relation to a child under 16 years of age. Under Labor\u2019s law, we have no power to prevent those people and others coming to our country. Mr Speaker, if they don\u2019t understand the laws they have introduced, no wonder the mistakes of the past will be recommitted, it is obvious, this man who wants to be prime minister is weaker than Gillard and Rudd put together. He couldn\u2019t stare down the left of his party which is a repeat of what happened with Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd. If Mr Shorten was ever to have control of this public policy again it would be a humanitarian disaster. Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: Will the prime minister please confirm that every government senator including his ministers in the Senate, voted against the disability royal commission last Thursday. Could he please advise which minister made the recommendation for the government senators to vote against the disability royal commission. Morrison: The answer is the same. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation chief Duncan Lewis has just smacked down the media for misrepresenting its advice and implying it leaks to influence political debates. Lewis said that despite the move from the attorney general\u2019s department to home affairs, Asio\u2019s \u201cstatutory independence\u201d remains. Lewis then makes two points: \u201cAsio does not and will not use its position to influence national debate with unauthorised disclosures\u201d. He said the organisation \u201cdoesn\u2019t leak as repeatedly implied in the media\u201d. Asio \u201cdoesn\u2019t provide running public commentary on the effectiveness of policy proposals\u201d. When reporting wrongly attributes advice from ASIO or our classified advice is leaked it undermines all we stand for. Lewis said these issues are important because they go to public trust and confidence in Asio. Breakdown in controls on how Asio advice is disseminated is \u201cseriously damaging\u201d. Tanya Plibersek to Scott Morrison: Which minister directed government senators to vote against the disability royal commission last Thursday and given the prime minister desperately wants people to believe he never opposed this royal commission, why did he allow one of his ministers to direct government senators to vote against it? Morrison: The shadow minister makes a whole range of assumptions in the question, which are a lot of speculation. I\u2019m so used to the member of Sydney coming to the box and making a bunch of assumptions, Mr Speaker ... ...We won\u2019t engage in this rank partisanship, where the opposition is simply trying to use people with disabilities for their own political purposes. Chris Crewther had the next dixer about the housing market. Negative gearing good, Labor bad is the short version of the answer from Josh Frydenberg. Frydenberg mentions Paul Keating, prompting Ed Husic to yell out \u201call tip and no iceberg\u201d but he times it for when the chamber is silent and it echoes across the chamber. He is warned. Kerryn Phelps has today\u2019s crossbench question: The mortgage broker model originated as a disruptor to the market [control] of the major banks regarding clients. With the government\u2019s proposed changes to the broking industry resulting from the royal commission into banking, how can the government ensure that the big banks do not benefit financially while average families and small business once again forced to pay the price of limited [competition]? Josh Frydenberg takes it: The reality is that only this side of the house supports mortgage brokers. Those opposite, don\u2019t, Mr Speaker. Those opposite don\u2019t. He then goes on to attack Labor for not having a response to the royal commission. Emma Husar to Scott Morrison: Children with a disability are waiting months to receive a NDIS plan and the support they need. Governments figures are showing a wait time of 15 weeks, adults waiting on specialist accommodation to be included in the plans so they can live independently. When will the government join with Labor to get rid of the NDIS staffing caps so people with a disability can get the support they need in a reasonable timeframe? Morrison hands it to the minister Paul Fletcher: The NDIS, is the most significant change and social policy we have seen for decades. ... There will be instances where the level of service is not what it should be and we continue to work towards improving that. At the same time, what we are seeing is systemic reform, across the scope of the work of the NDIS agency, improvement to the participant pathways from the 1 October last year, a new general participant pathway rolled out with a face-to-face meeting for every participant coming into the scheme. ... The member asked about specialist disability accommodation. This is a very important priority, especially for those who have especially high needs. They need specially designed accommodation which might need [re]designed bathrooms, and many other facilities. That is why over a week ago we announced a range of significant changes to the guidelines for specialist disability accommodation which have already produced responses from specialist providers, people like Summer Housing and Youngcare indicating they see these changes is very positive is likely to increase the flow of specialist disability, coming forward. Accommodation designed to meet the needs of Australians with disability. Giving them the opportunity to live in accommodation which meets their needs, frees them from living in institutional settings, [and gives them the opportunity ] to achieve the control, and the dignity, and the autonomy, which is a critical objective of the national disability insurance scheme. You can always tell when Michael McCormack is nearing the end of his dixer because he suddenly gets a lot louder. It\u2019s Michael McCormack time, which gives everyone, including the vast majority of the government benches, to catch up on paperwork and their phones. Linda Burney to Scott Morrison: Every government senator voted against the disability royal commission just four days ago, why won\u2019t the prime minister just tell the truth and admit he opposed the royal commission? It has been forced to back that because he lost control of the parliament. Isn\u2019t it clear this prime minister will do anything to desperately cling to power? \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d yells Luke Howarth from the government benches. Morrison: I was going to thank the member for the question but I specifically made a request to the leader for the opposition ... not to engage in partisan politics on support for people with disabilities. Mr Speaker, this is beyond a Labor Party, obsessed with the politics of the Canberra bubble, seeking only to try to score political points off people with disability. I will not do that. We will continue to take action to put in place the National disability insurance scheme, we will fund that, we will work towards all the issues and there are many in implementing what is a significant scheme, we will continue to make sure the commission is in place to allow us to receive complaints and act on them operate. I\u2019m disappointed when the Labor Party raised this issue for the first time in almost two years, they come in here and seek to play partisan politics over people with disabilities. I would ask them to refrain from that and the government will get on with the job. Sarah Hanson-Young has also responded to the report released today on the fish kill: Economists, lawyers and now scientists have highlighted the mismanagement of the Murray Darling basin as the leading factor in the dire state of our river. The river desperately needs more water if it is going to survive, and we need a federal royal commission to clean out the corruption, maladministration and incompetence,\u201d Greens environment and water spokesperson Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said. \u201cThe Academy of Sciences has made clear that planning, management and decision making needs to be informed by science, and in consultation with River communities and traditional owners. Their recommendations for a pumping embargo, and for water to be bought for the river need to be implemented immediately. \u201cThis report highlights the limitations of environmental water accounting and the grave danger posed by water use including floodplain harvesting and theft of overland flows, particularly in the Northern Basin. \u201cThe decision by Labor and the Government last year to reduce environmental flows in the Northern Basin must be reversed, as the SA royal commission and now, the Academy of Sciences report recommends. \u201cThis latest report, together with the SA royal commission and the Productivity Commission report, shows the river desperately needs a drink. It is a matter of life or death. These fish deaths are a symbol of mismanagement and misplaced priorities. \u201cThis is another opportunity for the Liberal National government, and the Labor party, to do right by the river. There must be cross-party support for these recommendations and a federal royal commission. The voice is raised up a few levels for the first dixer on how safe is Australia and are there any alternative views. It is straight into questions. Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: How can the prime minister claim his government never opposed a disability royal commission, when every government senator voted against it 14 days ago. Will the prime minister reverse the government\u2019s position and commit to establishing a royal commission into violence and abuse and neglect of people with a disability before the next election? Morrison (who is speaking very quietly. Someone seems to have had an anti-yelling refresher course) replies: I welcome those in the gallery who I know have a keen interest in the issue of disability and live disability and their families. The government takes the abuse and neglect of those disabilities seriously. At no point as a prime minister have I said I oppose a royal commission. What I said clearly in the House last week was we would consider this matter clearly and that matter will come before the House later today. I expect the motion to be passed as I made clear over the weekend, Mr Speaker. ... I\u2019m not seeking to make partisan points about this. Unlike the leader of the opposition, who is sadly is trying to make a partisan issue out of this, Mr Speaker. The last time the leader for the opposition raised a question regarding his proposal for a royal commission for these matters was in May 2017... until last Thursday, all of a sudden, Mr Speaker, the leader of the opposition recalls a proposal for which he has had no terms of reference, no specific details as to how it would be conducted. Mr Speaker... in response to the message from the Senate today the government will take this matter on, do what we always do, consult with stakeholders, states and territories. These are matters that had up until this time, before the formation of the national disability insurance scheme, were handled by state and territory governments. ... We will do the work to make sure when we take this issue forward, it will be done, in a well-thought through manner, without any partisan rancour. I invite the leader of the opposition to stop seeking to make this a partisan issue and make sure we have bipartisanship on the issue of people with disabilities. We provided that when we supported the national disability insurance scheme, we will continue to provide that ... and I invite the leader of the opposition to not play politics with disabilities. The House is all but in place and question time is about to begin. Who\u2019s that MP? It was Lisa Chesters. Kerryn Phelps in her 90-second statement: It was heartening over the weekend that the response in my electorate to the passage of last week\u2019s emergency medical transfers Bill was overwhelmingly positive. The people of Wentworth are compassionate, engaged and principled - they can see through the deliberate misinformation campaign currently being waged by the prime minister, the minister for home affairs and the attorney-general. In this spirit I note the following from a White House transcript of the phone call between ... Malcolm Turnbull and Donald Trump on 28 January 2017. The topic of discussion was the transfer deal struck between Mr Turnbull and US President Barrack Obama for the transfer of refugees from Australia\u2019s offshore processing centres to the United States. Mr Turnbull said and I quote: \u2018We know exactly who they are. They have been on Nauru or Manus for over three years and the only reason we cannot let them into Australia is because of our commitment to not allow people to come by boat. Otherwise we would have let them in \u2026 it is not because they are bad people.\u2019 Now we read in today\u2019s Daily Telegraph that around half of those refugees held in offshore processing centres on Manus Island and Nauru still do not have their identities confirmed and one in six checked so far have a red flag. Both of these things cannot be true. It really does appear that the current government cannot help itself when trying to score political points on refugees and asylum seekers. I am proud to continue the fine tradition of moderate small-L liberalism in the seat of Wentworth. I told the people of Wentworth that I would work to get kids off Nauru and for the humane treatment of people seeking asylum. The medical evacuations legislation delivers just that. It is a compassionate solution to a long-running humanitarian problem. The final bill addresses security concerns, it deals only with the current cohort of people in indefinite offshore detention while allowing doctors to do their job in helping patients get the medical care they desperately need. It gets the balance right. It is the hard right of the Liberal party that has left the people of Wentworth behind. The hard right refuses to embrace New Zealand\u2019s offer to resettle some refugees and now their shameful rhetoric puts the US deal at risk. Why would anyone trust what the current government says about refugees? We are about to head into the chamber \u2013 so hit us up with your QT predictions. Labor\u2019s Murray Watt is quizzing AFP commissioner Andrew Colvin about this Canberra Times story about a car driven by home affairs secretary Michael Pezzullo colliding with a cyclist. Colvin said there was a report to the police, the police attended and spoke to a range of individuals. \u201cI believe they concluded that no charges should be laid and no further police action is necessary,\u201d he said. Watt said it was a very serious incident. The cyclist\u2019s collarbone was broken and he was unable to drive for three months. Watt asks whether it was Pezzullo who reported the accident to the police - or someone else - and wants to know if anyone was drug and alcohol-tested. The AFP takes these questions on notice. \u201cI understand Mr Pezzullo left the scene without waiting for police, is there any requirement for people in accidents to wait for police to arrive?\u201d Watt asks and whether Pezzullo complied with that requirement. All on notice. Legal and constitutional affairs committee chair Ian Macdonald accuses Labor of \u201ctrashing reputations by innuendo ... This is an outrageous abuse of parliamentary privilege\u201d, he says. Liberal senator Linda Reynolds objects to \u201cthe imputation the AFP didn\u2019t follow procedures\u201d. Alistair MacGibbon is speaking about the cyber targeting of the parliamentary and party networks (he\u2019s the head of the cyber security centre): While the compromise of any network is extremely unfortunate, the public can be reassured that our agencies detected the intrusion and acted decisively to confront it. While this offender was sophisticated enough to compromise the networks, it was not sophisticated enough to remain undetected. The cyber security centre is undertaking significant remediation activities. We are working closely with affected organisations. We\u2019ve provided technical details to anti-virus companies so that this malicious activity can be identified globally. We have briefed state and territory electoral commissioners. Those responsible for cyber security in states and territories and the privacy commissioner. We\u2019ve also acted the cyber incident arrangements with our state and territory colleagues to ensure that this incident is managed in a controlled and collaborative manner. Our focus has been and continues to be on securing the affected networks. I can say that there is no evidence that this is an attempt to interfere in our electoral processes. This incident, again, shows that Australia and Australians are targeted by malicious actors. Our political institutions represent high-value targets. But we have resilient systems in place to detect compromises and remediate them. It\u2019s also a reminder that no system is 100% secure. The methods used by offenders are constantly evolving and all organisations should consider cyber security as an integral part of their business model. Helen Davidson has reported on the AFP pointing the finger at home affairs for what led up to Hakeem al-Araibi\u2019s detention in Thailand, from this morning\u2019s estimates hearings: Here is her full report: Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick has drawn our attention back to the outcome of the Australian Academy of Science review of the Menindee fish kill. The deputy prime minister Michael McCormack and other Nationals blame the lack of rain \u2013 and only the lack of rain \u2013 not the amount of water being taken out by irrigators. The report says - yeah, nah, it\u2019s both: The conditions leading to this event are an interaction between a severe (but not unprecedented) drought and, more significantly, excess upstream diversion of water for irrigation. Prior releases of water from Menindee Lakes contributed to lack of local reserves. The root cause of the fish kill is that there is not enough water in the Darling system to avoid catastrophic decline of condition through dry periods. Now I know you are all waiting on Paladin to be brought up in estimates \u2013 that won\u2019t be happening until later this afternoon. We are on the downhill slide into question time. And I don\u2019t know much, but I know it won\u2019t go for 150 minutes and that may be all I need to know. The Great Barrier Reef marine park authority has been telling Senate estimates about the impact of the Queensland floods on the Great Barrier Reef. Scientists are still monitoring the impact but GBRMPA warns that some of the things we could see in coming weeks and months are freshwater bleaching of corals stressed by a drop in the water\u2019s salinity levels, a dying off of some seagrasses and, potentially, deaths of animals that feed on seagrass such as dugongs and turtles. \u201cThere is likely to be a time lag of weeks to many months before we will know exactly what the impacts of this event are,\u201d Bruce Elliot, the acting chief executive of Gbrmpa tells the hearing. He says the one piece of good news is that the cooler weather up north has markedly reduced the chance of a mass thermal bleaching on the reef this year, but forecasts for coming months will be critical in determining how the reef will fare this summer. David Wachenfeld, the chief scientist at Gbrmpa, elaborates on the extent of flood plumes moving from Queensland\u2019s rivers out into the marine park. He says they plumes are being monitored by scientists from James Cook University and the Australian Institute of Marine Science and are \u201cextensive\u201d. He also warns that unusual wind conditions are carrying those flood plumes further east and offshore than they might normally go. He tells the hearing a bit more about freshwater bleaching, which is less well known than thermal bleaching of the kind that hit the reef in 2016 and 2017. Wachenfeld says it doesn\u2019t usually occur on the same scale as thermal bleaching but it can be rapid. The bad news is that scientists are already detecting areas on the reef where salinity levels have dropped to almost half their usual levels because of the flooding. This causes stress for corals and other marine life used to a saline environment and coral bleaching can result. He says there could be some overlap between areas affected by the last two mass bleachings and now the floods. \u201cThere probably will be reefs that were both affected by thermal stress in 2015/16 and/or 2016/17 that may now be affected by one of the various impacts that might come from this flooding,\u201d Wachenfeld says. \u201cWe have teams out under the marine monitoring program that GBRMPA manages.\u201d Only time will tell what the affect is, he says. He adds: \u201cI\u2019m certainly not able to put any kind of a figure on the spatial extent of the park that\u2019s affected by the flood plumes but I think I can safely say that they are extensive because there are rivers flooding all the way from the Whitsundays in the central Great Barrier Reef, right up to Cape Tribulation in the northern Great Barrier Reef.\u201d \u201cSo a substantial part of the central Great Barrier Reef is being affected by these plumes now.\u201d Labor\u2019s shadow industrial relations minister Brendan O\u2019Connor has been out and about on Senate estimates revelations about the AWU raid and leak investigation: There was testimony today in Senate estimates from the AFP that evidence was destroyed - evidence that would\u2019ve provided a greater likelihood of criminal prosecution was destroyed ... If you look at what\u2019s happened this morning, what you see is this: two ministers who have refused to make statements, even though they were requested by the AFP, evidence being destroyed ... and the AFP \u2013 who have conceded a criminal offence was committed \u2013 but it was harder to convict or to proceed to charge due to the lack of evidence. That goes directly to the conduct of ministers: the former minister for justice [Michael Keenan] and minister [Michaelia] Cash, who should now be called the minister for obstructing justice for refusing to provide statements to the AFP. Estimates Penny Wong is some of the best Penny Wong. She has just spent the last five minutes trying to get a prime minister\u2019s department official to tell her who started the Nauru/Manus US-refugee swap deal. We finally get there. About five minutes later. It was Malcolm Turnbull. Probably. Wong now wants to know \u201chow it came about\u201d. The committee is going on lunch now, until 1.30pm and then we move on to another department, before the department of PM and C is back. \u201cJust to note this, I will be returning to this, at that point,\u201d Wong says. Now, why is the the cyber targeting such a big deal? Because it is about five minutes out from an election. The parliamentary network includes emails. The party networks includes all sorts of things. Polling, plans of attack, internal emails between party heads, campaign briefings.... So what happens if any of this information shows up ahead of the election? Thats the issue. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has just held a presser and has confirmed that the small business access to justice measures \u2013 which passed the Senate on Thursday over Liberal objections \u2013 will pass on the voices in the House. Frydenberg declines to explain why the government has reversed its position \u2013 although the breakout of Nationals who backed Labor\u2019s policy explains it. Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce immediately followed the treasurer to take credit for the backdown: So to hear today that we\u2019re actually going to provide equality of access to justice - where people get a fair outcome not because of the size of their cheque book or their capacity to have a legal department but because they have a just case. This is something the National party have been fighting for for so long and it\u2019s great to see it looks like it\u2019s going to prevail ... So often you\u2019ve seen farmers in the past have a just position against the major supermarkets but no capacity whatsoever to pay the legal fees that would be required to take it on. Joyce also called for the government to revisit the divestiture powers, noting a bill to allow courts to break up big energy companies is still on the notice paper. He did not rule out amending the small business bill, explaining the Nationals \u201cwant both\u201d. On a separate issue, Frydenberg did not commit to a lower house vote on payday lending, he simply noted there is a committee inquiry report due on Friday. Penny Wong is asking the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet about when it first became aware the medical evacuation bill may have been unconstitutional. When it was tabled (and reported) is the answer. This seems timely: The joint committee of public accounts and audit has commenced a new inquiry into cyber resilience, based on auditor-general\u2019s report No. 53 (2017-18), Cyber Resilience. Committee chair senator Dean Smith said the cyber resilience of commonwealth agencies continues to be a key focus of the joint committee. \u201cEffective implementation of a comprehensive cyber security framework across commonwealth agencies is critical to protect Australians\u2019 privacy and Australia\u2019s social, economic and national security interests from emerging cyber threats,\u201d Smith said. The committee invites submissions to the inquiry by 4 March 2019, addressing the terms of reference. A public hearing will be held in mid-March. Further information about the inquiry can be accessed via the committee\u2019s website. The JCPAA is parliament\u2019s joint public administration committee. It scrutinises the governance, performance and accountability of commonwealth agencies, and has the power to inquire into all expenditure of commonwealth money. The committee examines all reports of the auditor-general tabled in the Parliament and can inquire into any items, matters or circumstances connected with these reports. Barnaby Joyce has an idea of where to look: Bill Shorten: I thank the prime minister for his statement and the opportunity for the House to address such an important matter. The integrity of our democracy and trust in our political institutions is fundamental to our national security. I agree with the prime minister that whatever the rhetorical political or indeed substantial differences between government and opposition on any given day, whatever disagreements and disputes may consume the Parliament even in the coming hours, when it comes to national security, we all have a joint obligation. We are in this together. Keeping Australians safe is not a political slogan. It is the highest priority of every political party and every member of this place. So, obviously, the attempted hacking of the Parliament House network is a source of grave concern to us all. Over the past few years, we have witnessed a range of attempted infiltrations and manipulations in the democratic processes of Germany, Japan, to Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the United States, France and Canada. We cannot be complacent and, as this most recent activity reported by the prime minister indicates, we are not exempt or immune. Now, as the prime minister has indicated, government institutions, such as our Electoral Commissions, are largely well protected, but our party political structures perhaps are more vulnerable. We have seen overseas that it is progressive parties that are more likely to be targeted by ultra-rightwing organisations. Political parties are small organisations with only a few full-time staff, they collect, store and use large amounts of information about voters and communities. These institutions can be a soft target and our national approach to cyber security needs to pay more attention to non-government organisations. Our agencies shouldn\u2019t just be providing advice to political parties, but actively assisting in their defence. I have to say today to people listening in Parliament that my words are not just about political parties, but for Australia\u2019s small and medium businesses, our educational institutions and individuals. Everything that depends on internet technology, even if it is not actively connected to the global internet at all times is part of cyberspace. Cyberspace is a fully functioning reality. It is an ecosystem. The virtual world of cyberspace has created an ecosystem. New domains of human experience and millions of community within it that mimic the real world. It is an eco-system that has generated prosperity, and profound benefits to millions. It is an eco-system that also has spawned multiple threats to individuals, to businesses of all sizes, critical far, national security and our democratic systems. It is an echo-system that is growing rapidly each and every day. In 2015, it was estimated that 25bn devices were connected to the internet. That is eight times the number of people considered online. By 2020, the number of devices connected to the Internet is estimated to increase to 50bn devices. So the economy is no longer just merely enabled by cyber. Cyber is part of the economy and we are all connected in the economy. Cyber security affects every Australian in every way nearly every day. So we need every Australian equipped ... to protect our institutions, freedoms and values. It means improving awareness of cyber risks and strategies the guard against them. It means that we need to train up more Australians in our universities, TAFEs, research centres and our workplaces to fill national skill shortages and cyber security. In closing, I would say that I have great trust in our security agencies and their professionalism to do all that they can to protect our nation against cyber threats, but we constantly need to be asking ourselves our settings are right. The Commonwealth national cyber security adviser is dual in its policy role reporting to the secretary of home affairs that also is operational head of the Australian cyber security centre reporting to the director-general of the signals directorate. Some are concerned that this creates piping. We need a cohesive national approach through the cyber security centre as a single entity, responsible for managing the cyber mission in totality and reporting up there a single chain. We perhaps need to consider whether the Australian cyber security centre should be the single point of contact and accountability for all cyber-related communication, reporting, sin response, crisis communication, management, threat intelligent capability, operations and policy. This centre should remain based in the defence portfolio and continue to report to the director-general of the signals directorate. The threats we face in this field are always evolving and changing so we must continue to adapt and update our methods in defences because what we are defending, the integrity, transparency and health of our democracy, matters to every decision that we make in this place and every Australian that we serve. Scott Morrison: Australia\u2019s democratic process is our greatest asset: our most critical piece of national infrastructure. Public confidence in the integrity of our democratic processes is an essential element of Australian sovereignty and governance. While we will vigorously argue over many issues in this place, we are all united in our commitment to democratic principles. Members will be aware that the Australian Cyber Security Centre recently identified a malicious intrusion into the Australian Parliament House computer network. During the course of this work, we also became aware that the networks of some political parties - Liberal, Labor and the Nationals - have also been affected. Our security agencies have detected this activity and acted decisively to confront it. They are securing these systems and protecting users. I do not propose to go into the detail of these operational matters. But our cyber experts believe that a sophisticated state actor is responsible for this malicious activity. Let me be clear though \u2013 there is no evidence of any electoral interference. We have put in place a number of measures to ensure the integrity of our electoral system. I have instructed the Australian Cyber Security Centre to be ready to provide any political party or electoral body in Australia with immediate support, including making their technical experts available. They have already briefed the Electoral Commissions and those responsible for cyber security for all states and territories. They have also worked with global anti-virus companies to ensure Australia\u2019s friends and allies have the capacity to detect this malicious activity. We have acted decisively to protect our national interests. The methods used by malicious actors are constantly evolving and this incident reinforces yet again the importance of cyber security as a fundamental part of everyone\u2019s business. The Australian Government will continue to take a proactive and coordinated approach to protecting Australia\u2019s sovereignty, our economy and our national security. That is why the Government has invested in cyber security, including strengthening the Australian Cyber Security Centre by bringing all of the Australian Government\u2019s cyber security capability together in one place (July 2018). Our political system and our democracy remains strong, vibrant and is protected. We stand united in the protection of our values and our sovereignty. The Government has chosen to be transparent about these matters. This in itself is an expression of faith by our Government in our democratic system and our determination to defend it. Scott Morrison says the attack appear to have come from a \u201csophisticated state actor\u201d from overseas. It wasn\u2019t just the parliament which was targeted. Prime minister Scott Morrison is telling the parliament that the Liberal party, Nationals party and the Labor party were all recently targeted. More to come. Over at the home affairs estimates hearing, Michael Pezzullo says he referred the leak of the Asio brief to NewsCorp (which has since been declassified by the government) without consulting with minister Peter Dutton. He says that is normal when he sees \u201cslabs\u201d of information he knows his department prepared in the media. The AFP is evaluating the information. Linda Reynolds jumps in to say that \u201cclearly part of the evaluation has to be if a leak occurred\u201d and that Murray Watt\u2019s assertion that it was \u201ca leak\u201d is an assumption. \u201cHow else did it happen,\u201d Watt asks. Reynolds sticks to the line that it is still to be determined if it is a \u201cleak\u201d. Pezzullo: \u201cOn its face it appears to be the case that it is possible...\u201d[that classified information ended up in the news report] Mathias Cormann was just caught out sitting on his phone while David Leyonhjelm was asking a question, and upon being called out with a \u201chello minister\u201d looked like every teenager found with their phone at the dinner table ever. Over in the PMO estimates, Penny Wong has entered the room \u2013 she wants to know who is leaking Asio briefings. She wants to know if the prime minister has satisfied himself it didn\u2019t come from home affairs minister Peter Dutton. Mathias Cormann has taken that on notice (he\u2019s the minister representing the minister) A spokesman for assistant treasurer Stuart Robert confirmed to Guardian Australia that the government will support Labor\u2019s small business access to justice measures that passed the Senate on Thursday. The Nationals supported the reform, risking a Coalition boil over that the Morrison government has now avoided Next up at environment estimates is the Bureau of Meteorology. They\u2019ve had an extremely busy summer due to record-breaking heat, bushfires and other natural disasters, including the Queensland floods. The Bom\u2019s director, Andrew Johnson, opens by answering a question from Labor\u2019s Anthony Chisholm about the recent extreme weather. He states what all Australians have felt this season, which is that a lot of records have been broken. \u201cThe most outstanding ones I think would be both heat and rainfall,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cWe know that right across the country there were heat records broken at both the back end of 2018 and January 2019 was the hottest month on record since records have been kept. \u201cAlso, as you know, there was very significant weather in north Queensland during late January and into February. \u201cRight across that part of the world there were records broken \u2013 weekly totals, monthly totals, again the list is extensive.\u201d He says he will supply a more detailed list on notice but you can read more about January\u2019s heatwave here Chisholm asks whether the record-breaking weather shows Australia is feeling the impacts of climate change. Johnson says when it comes to the recent heat and bushfires there is no doubt that is the case. \u201cWe certainly know that the heat situation is very strongly driven by climate change,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong drying and warming trend in this country which we can attribute to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. \u201cThe rainfall situation is much more difficult. At this stage the science is really still working to attribute specific rainfall events to climate change. But on things like fire and heat, the science is quite strong in terms of the link between recent events and anthropogenic climate change.\u201d On the medical evacuation bill attacks, Bill Shorten had this to say: I think what we need to do is call out shameless Coalition lies about Labor policy. Anyone who tries to get on a boat, we will send them to regional processing, Manus island or \u2013 what we have done is codify when people who need medical treatment, in our care, instead of having Peter Dutton in charge of health plans are individuals, we will have a listen to the doctors. Ask yourself, when you are feeling sick do you go and see Peter Dutton or do you go and see the doctor. We have the same policy, all we are doing is codify in it. This is where the government are such a cheeky bunch of roosters. They have brought 900 people here already from Manus and Nauru based on medical advice. Yet somehow when Labor and Kerryn Phelps and the conscience of the Liberal party proposed to codify and put some rules around it, the government said somehow that was a terrible idea. The government cannot have that both ways. I promise Australians we will fight the people smugglers. If we win the next election we will have the same navy and the same air force and the same Border Force, doing all the same things, but we\u2019ll make sure we have strong borders without sacrificing the humanity of treating a few people who are in our duty of care. So question time should be fun. Bill Shorten at a press conference calling on the government to announce a royal commission into disability abuse: This is a government that is out of control. You can all see it, why don\u2019t we say what it is, it doesn\u2019t matter if it is refusing to vote on a disability royal commission, because they are so puffed up with their own pride they don\u2019t want to be seen to lose a vote, or, we have got the scandalous Paladin, where they can hand out contract, Peter Dutton yet again at the centre of an incompetency scandal, handing out $423m and then saying it has nothing to do with me, it\u2019s my department. Well, hello, Peter, you are the minister. If it isn\u2019t your department, whose is it? And they carry on with this anti-union bias, yet they never have anything to say about how everything is going up in Australia except wages. Australians can smell a desperate government at a hundred paces and this is a desperate government. They opposed Labor\u2019s measures to protect small business. We want to give small business the power to take on big is this when they believe the business is behaving badly to small business, and we have done this by saying that small business shouldn\u2019t face the litigation hurdle of paying the cost of big isn\u2019t as in the court case. So essentially we are backing David in a David and Goliath struggle. The government is splitting the Senate and split in the House. The problem in Australia is that we have a government to incompetent and too divided to run a government, but too desperate and too scared to taste the people.\u201d Dutton has said he did not have anything to do with the contract, and that it was done within the department, after going through a commonwealth procurement process. David Littleproud has responded to the announcement from Woolworths that it will end the $1 milk sales. All litre milk containers will include a \u201cdrought levy\u201d and sell for $1.10. The extra 10c goes back to farmers. Two and three litre milk will sell for $2.20 and $3.30 respectively. The move comes after many, many dairy farmers have been forced to shut up shop or sell overseas because they couldn\u2019t make ends meet in Australia. \u201cThe $1 milk disaster began on 1 January 2011, and I hope today is the beginning of its end,\u201d Littleproud said in his statement. \u201cWhilst I wish Woolworths was taking a much bigger step, they\u2019re miles head of their competitors and it\u2019s sad it has taken National party pressure to get to this point. \u201cColes and Aldi continue to sell milk at $1. This drives down prices to farmers. Supermarkets can\u2019t pretend selling milk cheap doesn\u2019t hurt farmers and they\u2019ve got to be called out on this rubbish. \u201cConsumers have the power here. If everybody who clicks \u2018like\u2019 on a Facebook video bought branded milk instead of cheap supermarket brand milk, or punished Coles and Aldi by going elsewhere, big changes would occur overnight. \u201cAll supermarkets should pay a fair price for all dairy \u2013 this includes cheese and yoghurt, not just fresh milk, which is a small fraction of the market. \u201cThe ACCC report into the dairy industry clearly says supermarkets use their market power to drive down how much they pay processors, and processors then use their bargaining power to drive down what they in turn pay farmers. \u201cThere were around 7,500 dairy farmers in 2010 and now there are just under 6,000 as the industry has consolidated. Earlier this morning Scott Morrison spoke with Alan Jones on 2GB, particularly about the floods in north Queensland and the effect on farmers. Here\u2019s an interesting tidbit from Morrison: \u201cIt\u2019s going to require a reconstruction plan, property by property. It\u2019s going to require dealing with existing debt. It\u2019s going to have to deal with future debt. It\u2019s going to have to deal with subsidies for how you rebuild your stock. So this is what we\u2019re putting in place.\u201d This sounds a lot like demands Bob Katter was making last week for a cattle reconstruction board which would allow the government to borrow at 2.4% interest and provide low-interest loans to cattle farmers. Katter is due to introduce a private members bill for the same this morning in the House of Representatives. We\u2019ll try to find out the details of the government package for you. The department and the Australian Antarctic Division have been asked about Japan\u2019s whaling activities in the Southern Ocean. In December, Japan announced it would leave the International Whaling Commission and resume commercial whaling for the first time in more than 30 years. Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson has asked if Japan\u2019s ships have been in the Southern Ocean, if they are still there or if they have left. He also asks what knowledge the AAD has of Japan\u2019s activities. Matt Cahill, deputy secretary of strategy and operations for the environment department, says the issue is the responsibility of Home Affairs. But Dean Knudson, the deputy secretary of the environment protection group, confirms Japan\u2019s ships were there this year. \u201cOur understanding is that the Japanese whaling fleet absolutely went to the Southern Ocean this year,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it made a commitment, obviously, as part of their process of changing to observer status at the International Whaling Commission that they intend to not conduct any further whaling in the Southern Ocean in future years.\u201d He says department officials will be able to give more specifics later on. Helen Davidson wrote a little about what some of those laws are already doing: The Australian government is attempting to deport another Indigenous man to New Zealand, despite him having no ties to the country where he was born while his parents were visiting the country more than 30 years ago. Tim Galvin\u2019s mother and three brothers are Australian-born citizens, and his father is a UK-born citizen. His mother has signed a statutory declaration stating she is of Aboriginal descent. Galvin\u2019s wife is a Noongar woman and they have four children together. Last week Galvin was about to be released on parole after serving most of a two-and-a-half year prison sentence at Acacia Prison for burglary. \u201cThen the day before I was getting out on parole \u2026 they told me they were coming to take me to the detention centre,\u201d Galvin told Guardian Australia from the Yongah Hill facility, outside of Perth. Galvin learned he was a New Zealand citizen when his Australian visa was cancelled in 2016. He appealed and said his lawyers had pushed for a resolution before his release but 17 months later, there was none and he received a notice of deportation.\u201d The New Zealand government took the unusual step of writing to the committee reviewing the amendment, to stand against it. New Zealand acknowledges Australia\u2019s sovereign right to take actions to protect the community and to manage its borders. New Zealand\u2019s principal concern relates to visa cancellation of New Zealanders who arrived in Australia as children. By cancelling their visas, Australia is not taking responsibility for these people\u2019s failure to succeed in Australian society, despite them, in many cases, being a product of Australian society.\u201d Labor senators on the committee sent in a dissenting report, noting that of the 17 submissions the committee received on the bill, just one was in favour of the changes \u2013 the home affairs department. And just on that below post, here is what you\u2019ll hear government MPs say about it (gotta love those talking points) Talking points \u2022 This bill is about ensuring our migration program meets community expectations. \u2022 The Australian community expects government to keep people safe \u2013 that\u2019s why we introduced this bill. \u2022 This Bill ensures that non-citizens who have been convicted of serious offences, and who pose a risk to the safety of the Australian community, are appropriately considered for visa refusal or cancellation. \u2022 Those who choose to break the law and fail to uphold the standards of behaviour expected by the Australian community should expect to lose that privilege. \u2022 The Australian government remains committed to protecting the Australian community from the risk of harm posed by non-citizens. \u2022 This bill acknowledges that offences of this nature demonstrate a disregard and unwillingness to be part of a cohesive and safe community. \u2022 These offences conflict directly with Australian values and breaks the fabric of our society. David Coleman has sent out a missive to colleagues about the migration amendment the government announced last year. In case anyone in the government missed it, you can find it below (with thanks to our secret squirrels). The aim of the bill is to: amend the character test by providing grounds to consider visa cancellation or refusal where a non-citizen has been convicted of offences involving violence against a person, weapons, breaching of an apprehended violence order (or similar) or non-consensual sexual acts; and make consequential amendments. As you\u2019d be aware, the migration amendment (strengthening the character test) bill 2018 is listed for debate this week. Our government has been very successful in kicking criminals out of Australia. This bill is about strengthening these provisions within the Migration Act even further. The bill amends the character test by providing grounds to consider visa cancellation or refusal where a non-citizen has been convicted of offences involving violence against a person, weapons, breaching of an apprehended violence order (or similar) or nonconsensual sexual acts. It should come as no surprise that the Labor party has decided to oppose this bill. Labor has learned nothing from when they were last in government; Labor is soft on border protection having voted with the Greens and independents last week to weaken our border security and now they are set to vote against measures that seek to keep dangerous criminals from coming to, or remaining in Australia. The Australian public expect the government to keep them safe and know the Liberal and Nationals parties are the only ones who can do that. I encourage you to speak in support of this bill.\u201d A little more on that exchange Murph reported on earlier between the AFP and Labor senator Murray Watt on evidence in the AWU raids leak case the AFP looked into: Watt: What did your investigation reveal regarding the destruction of evidence? For instance, text messages, emails or anything like that by anyone? AFP: Senator, I don\u2019t have that detail before me. We compiled the evidence, the witness statements, all the material that we had available to us and provided that to the commonwealth DPP to consider. Watt: Did you find any evidence that evidence relating to the leak may have been destroyed? AFP: We understood that could have been the case in some instances, yes. Watt: Involving ministerial staff? AFP: It\u2019s impossible for me to speculate today who that may or may not have been. I also did not hear the evidence in the trial. Watt: Sure. But in your investigation you found some evidence that evidence relating to this leak had been destroyed? AFP: Yes senator, we did find some of that material may have been destroyed, but we spoke to over 67 people, senator. The AFP has made clear that it put forward a brief on one unnamed person, to the commonwealth Department of Public Prosecutions, which found there was insufficient evidence to move forward (inefficient evidence to gain a conviction). Josh Frydenberg is giving us an insight into what he\u2019ll be concentrating on this question time: Labor\u2019s response to the banking royal commission. From his release: The Coalition government is getting on with the job of implementing the recommendations of the royal commission and, in a number of important areas, is going further to reform the financial services sector. We have passed legislation through the Senate to: \u2022 extend civil penalties to superannuation fund trustees and directors for breach of their best interests duty (recommendation 3.7); \u2022 ban superannuation funds from inducing employers (recommendations 3.6); \u2022 provide the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) with more powers to deal with underperforming superannuation funds; \u2022 proactively reunite superannuation members with their low-balance and inactive accounts; \u2022 ban superannuation exit fees and cap fees on certain accounts; and \u2022 significantly increase criminal and civil penalties for corporate and financial sector misconduct. We have announced a capability review of the Apra (recommendation 6.13). We have announced an immediate review of financial counselling services. We are working with the states and territories towards establishing a national farm debt mediation scheme (recommendation 1.11). In contrast to the government\u2019s immediate action, the Labor party has not even responded to the final report after two weeks. Labor has said it will implement all the recommendations \u201cin principle\u201d. The government says that is not good enough. This is all over the fight the government is hoping will shape up between the Labor party and mortgage brokers, over the \u201cuser pays\u201d change Kenneth Hayne recommended. The committees are on break, giving us all a chance to catch our breath. In the House, the private members bills are being introduced by the independents and crossbench. These are not expected to go anywhere in what is left of this parliament. Ian MacDonald\u2019s iPad timer has just gone off in the legal affairs committee. Hold on to that sound people. This will be one of the last times we hear it. Think of it as his swan song (MacDonald has been relegated to an unwinnable spot on the Queensland LNP ticket). The Greens are asking the government about its plan to underwrite power plants to encourage new power generation. The department has taken many of the questions on notice or tells Sarah Hanson-Young it\u2019s the subject of budget preparations and not up for discussion. Secretary Finn Pratt does say there have been 66 expressions of interest \u2013 which we already knew \u2013 in the scheme, but doesn\u2019t provide more detail. \u201cHas the government made a decision on how to implement the program ... do you know, Mr Pratt?\u201d Hanson-Young asks. \u201cThat decision is subject to the budget process, which we\u2019ve got under way,\u201d he says. Hanson-Young then asks whether the rollout of the program would require supporting legislation, following legal advice commissioned by The Australia Institute, which suggests some form of legislation will be necessary. \u201cThe constitutional risk of all government expenditure programs or legislative initiatives are all considered as part of the cabinet process,\u201d government senator Simon Birmingham says. Michaelia Cash\u2019s former chief of staff, Ben Davies, has told the federal court he learned about the impending AFP raids on the Australian Workers\u2019 Union from the union regulator\u2019s acting media adviser Mark Lee. Under questioning from the AWU\u2019s lawyer, Herman Borenstein, Davies told the court Lee called him on 24 October and \u201cvolunteered\u201d an \u201cunsourced tip-off\u201d. \u201c[The information was] unsolicited, unprompted and unexpected,\u201d he said. The pair had been organising the arrangements for Lee to start in Cash\u2019s office as a new media adviser. At the time, Lee was working the Registered Organisations Commission, which was investigating the AWU. The court heard last week that Davies went on to pass the information to Cash\u2019s former media adviser David De Garis, who then worked with an aide to Michael Keenan to tip off news outlets before the raids. Cash said in court last week she first learned about the raids when she watched them unfold on television. Davies said on Monday he did not think to tell Cash that operational information was being disseminated because she was in \u201cback-to-back\u201d meetings. \u201cThe information at the time was an unsourced tip-off whose veracity had not yet been confirmed,\u201d he said. Lee did not \u201cindicate his source of the information\u201d, Davies told the court. Davies also acknowledged there were \u201cobvious political implications\u201d to what Lee had told him \u2013 that the donations were made when \u201cMr Shorten was involved with the Australian Workers\u2019 Union\u201d. Kate Ellis is also due to give her valedictory speech in the House today. She announced she would not be contesting the next election last year. We are getting all these speeches in early, because the next scheduled parliamentary sitting is in April, when the budget will be handed down. And shortly after that the election will be called. Labor and the Greens will both be pushing Scott Morrison to call a royal commission into disability abuse. While the calls for this have gone on for years, Jordon Steele-John most recently tried to have disability abuse added to the aged care royal commission and was rejected by Mathias Cormann. Morrison says he is not against the royal commission, but has given no indication he will call one. Instead, the government wants to consult. Labor is moving forward with its attack, with this release giving an insight into where we can expect question time to go: [Scott Morrison] needs to unequivocally get behind this today. This must be voted upon today. We must get a result today. People with disability deserve nothing less than a broad-based and dedicated royal commission. It cannot be tacked-on the aged care royal commission as an afterthought. The royal commission must examine a wide range of contexts, including health, mental health, education and justice \u2013 not just disability services and the NDIS. And the terms of reference must be finalised in consultation with people with disability and advocates. Scott Morrison can\u2019t just let this slide through the parliament today and then forget about it. He cannot obfuscate any longer. He needs to put aside the resources and start taking action immediately. People with disability have waited long enough \u2013 the time has come to get this done. \u201cWe understood that could have been the case\u201d Labor senator Murray Watt is persisting in the Cash investigation. Watt references evidence given last week in the court case that text messages were deleted. Cash\u2019s former media adviser, David De Garis, told the court he deleted three text messages he\u2019d exchanged with a colleague in Michael Keenan\u2019s office about the leaks before his phone was collected after he resigned. Watt wonders whether any of this behaviour could be considered perverting the course of justice. Linda Reynolds says this is entirely hypothetical and cautions Watt against asking the AFP about evidence given in the court last week. It\u2019s subjudice, she says, and says the police aren\u2019t across the specifics of the court testimony. Watt changes course. He asks the police whether during the course of their inquiries into the leak, they formed an impression that evidence might have been destroyed. One of the police at the table says: We understood that could have been the case.\u201d Another police witness repeats that observation about the destruction of evidence. The AFP commissioner, Andrew Colvin, repeats an earlier observation that leaks of police operations are detrimental, potentially putting the safety of officers in jeopardy. Watt asks him whether the AFP might reopen this investigation in the light of the court evidence. Colvin hedges. \u201cIt always remains a possibility to reopen\u201d an investigation, he says, but declines to suggest one way or the other whether he\u2019ll reopen this one. The AWU federal court case is still underway. Scott Ryan can\u2019t say as yet if any information was taken in the parliamentary computer network breach. But he said if necessary the relevant security agencies may brief MPs. Labor has now asked the department about the export of Australian birds to the Association for the Conservation of threatened parrots, a German organisation run by a convicted criminal. Hundreds of endangered and rare Australian birds have been exported, despite multiple allegations to the department that they are being traded for large sums of money. Labor\u2019s Anne Urquart has asked whether the department is examining Australia\u2019s export laws and whether it\u2019s had discussions with DFAT and the Australian embassy about the case. Dean Knudson, the deputy secretary for the environment protection group, is telling Labor to ask questions later in the day. \u201cYes, we\u2019re absolutely aware of the issue and are looking into it,\u201d he says. Andrew Colvin has fronted his estimates hearing and given a short introduction. The AFP commissioner addressed the Hakeem al-Araibi \u201cissue\u201d \u2013 namely its handling of the Interpol red notice which led to his detention. He says the AFP stayed silent to give Al-Araibi\u2019s the best chance of a safe return. He then points to the actions of Home Affairs. \u201cAs the committee would know, the AFP hosts the Australian-Interpol national central bureau and AFP staff are seconded to the NCB. On the 8th of November 2018 at the request of Bahrain, Interpol issued a red notice for Mr Al-Araibi, which AFP conveyed to the Australian Border Force of the 9th of November. \u201cThis is a routine process as many names come on and off Interpol watch lists regularly. At this time, neither the AFP nor the Australian-Interpol national central bureau was aware of Mr Al-Araibi\u2019s visa status. This was not known until after his detention in Thailand. \u201cNeither the AFP or the Australian-Interpol NCB can access visa information. We rely on notifications from the Home Affairs department. The Home Affairs department provided Mr Al-Araibi\u2019s visa status to the AFP on the 28th of November, the day after his detention in Thailand. On 29 November, the AFP sought and was granted permission by the Department of Home Affairs to refer Mr Al-Araibi\u2019s visa status to Interpol\u2019s office of legal affairs on the 29th of November. \u201cInterpol removed the notice within 24 hours of the AFP\u2019s provision of this information. The red notice was rescinded on 1 December Australian and Thailand time, which was the 30th of November France time. I cam confident that at all times the Australian-Interpol NCB adhered to the policies and procedures of Interpol. \u201cThe Home Affairs portfolio has undertaken a number of reviews to establish a chronology of actions with a view to improving information exchange and reducing the risk of similar cases in the future.\u201d Ray Hadley is going back to 2001. He talks about how John Howard was down in the polls, but then mentions the Tampa incident in August. He forgets about what happened that September, though. \u201cIt\u2019s an illustration about what can happen in a very short amount of time,\u201d he says. Tony Abbott hmmmmms very thoughtfully. \u201cGovernments that have conviction and character can come back and what we have seen from the prime minister and ministers over the last few months is conviction and character and I think we\u2019ll see more of that.\u201d Home affairs estimates has kicked off this morning with evidence from the Australian federal police. Labor wants to know why Michaelia Cash isn\u2019t at the table this morning. The junior home affairs minister, Linda Reynolds, is at the table instead. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like having me here, that is entirely your problem,\u201d Reynolds tells the Labor senator Murray Watt. At one point the committee chair, Queensland Liberal Ian MacDonald, wonders why Reynolds doesn\u2019t answer questions in the chamber if she\u2019s here at the table in estimates. It\u2019s not clear whether this question is rhetorical. She says she\u2019s not in cabinet. After this slightly strange preamble, which is designed in political terms to highlight Cash\u2019s absence from the hearing while the AFP is answering questions into a police investigation into her office \u2013 we move to the substance. Police tell the hearing they interviewed 60 people in connection with the leak from Cash\u2019s office about last year\u2019s AFP raids at the AWU\u2019s offices, taking witness statements. Cash and then then justice minister, Michael Keenan, did not give witness statements, but they provided written responses to the AFP. The AFP says the letter the two ministers sent does not qualify as a witness statement. Eight people declined to give the AFP witness statements.The cops confirm that some of the people who declined to give witness statements were involved in last week\u2019s court hearings. If you missed last week\u2019s developments in the court, the latest news report is here. Tony Abbott and Ray Hadley are having their fortnightly on-air lovefest. Both are in good moods this morning. \u201cI am the first to admit that sometimes this government hasn\u2019t been great at politics,\u201d Abbott says. But they have been very competent, he adds. The environment department is up in Senate estimates hearings today and first up they are getting a grilling from Labor and Greens senators about the performance of the environment minister, Melissa Price, and her lack of public appearances since taking over the role. Labor\u2019s Anthony Chisholm has asked the department secretary whether the minister requested briefings on the Tasmanian fires, the Queensland floods and the mass fish kill in Menindee. The department\u2019s secretary Finn Pratt says, on the subject of the fires, \u201cwe are endlessly briefing ministers on things which happen which relate to their responsibilities\u201d. Dean Knudson, the deputy secretary of the environment protection group, says \u201cI don\u2019t recall whether a specific briefing was sought or sent\u201d and senators should ask the department again later in the day. Chisholm and Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young are asking the department about what interviews the minister has given on the natural disasters that have occurred over summer. Knudson says they will have to take the questions on notice. \u201cSurely you can answer that,\u201d Hanson-Young says. The department also says it will have to take on notice questions about which stakeholders the minister has met with since taking over the portfolio. Michaelia Cash is meant to be the minister representing the minister for home affairs in estimates, but she isn\u2019t in the room. Linda Reynolds is, as the assistant minister. That led to a fun exchange between Labor senator Murray Watt and Reynolds over why Cash wasn\u2019t there, which ended with Reynolds basically saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve got me.\u201d Even Ian Macdonald seemed a little confused by that. Scott Ryan is updating the estimates hearing looking at the parliament. He updates the committee on the parliament network breach and says further security protocols are now in place, but the investigation is ongoing. The parliamentary upgrades, which have been going on for more than a year \u2013 and were due to be completed in July 2018 and are still going on \u2013 are going to be delayed further because the subcontractor responsible for the steel has gone into voluntary administration. Another subcontractor is being contracted, but the security upgrades won\u2019t be finished until October this year now. Huzzah. The estimate hearings have begun \u2013 but the House is still sitting as normal and you\u2019ll find today\u2019s program, here You can find all the estimate hearings here In his doorstop, David Coleman was asked about the Paladin contract. Expect it to be the big-ticket item of the Home Affairs estimates hearing: Those processes are a matter for the department. They are run by the department and not by ministers. My understanding is that is the case for all of these sorts of contracts and they are subject to the usual rules, including audit rules of the commonwealth and so on and the department has stated quite clearly that it\u2019s followed all of those correct rules. I tweeted this out last week, but probably worth another reminder, given the number of stories we will no doubt see about asylum seekers and refugees we suddenly have security concerns over. In the phone call between Malcolm Turnbull and Donald Trump, the one where the transcript was leaked, the then-prime minister told the leader of the free world: We know exactly who they are. They have been on Nauru or Manus for over three years and the only reason we cannot let them into Australia is because of our commitment to not allow people to come by boat. Otherwise we would have let them in. If they had arrived by airplane and with a tourist visa then they would be here.\u201d He also said \u201cit\u2019s not because they are bad people\u201d. Just putting it on the record again, because no doubt it is going to come up time and time and time and time again in the next few months. You may remember last week the government took (what was left) of it\u2019s \u201cbig stick\u201d divesture legislation off the agenda, after the Greens looked like having the numbers to amend the bill, to prohibit the government from being able to fund coal-fire generation projects. So the legislation which started as \u201cwe will break up electricity companies if you don\u2019t do the right thing\u201d, which became \u201cwe will break up the electricity companies if the federal court says we can and only after a bunch of warnings from the regulators\u201d will now go to the election as a policy, rather than a set-in-stone piece of legislation. So what is the government\u2019s energy policy? Angus Taylor tells Sky it has not changed. \u201cLower prices, keeping the lights on.\u201d On what the government can do in the mean time, Katharine Murphy had this report: A new legal opinion suggests the Morrison government will not have the ability to roll out taxpayer support to its controversial plan to underwrite new coal plants unless it enacts supporting legislation or amends existing legislation. The advice, sought by the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, argues assistance for new generation projects will require \u201csome form of supporting legislation\u201d, either new or existing, to operate and fund the program, otherwise the arrangements would be open to a high court challenge. Federal parliament resumes on Monday for one of the last sitting periods before the May election, and the Morrison government has already pulled its much-vaunted \u201cbig stick\u201d energy legislation because of concerns it would have to cop an amendment from the Greens and Labor, preventing the government from funding new coal projects.\u201d Looks like the Things That Matter is back as a LNP slogan. Angus Taylor has certainly been practicing the talking points, given that he got variations of \u201cBill Shorten/Labor is weak on the things that matter\u201d in his Sky News interview at least three times just then. You may remember \u201cThings That Matter\u201d as the slogan which helped end Alexander Downer\u2019s leadership of the Liberal party in 1994. Oh this is going well. Not sure that is the best line to take, given what the reports are finding about the Murray-Darling basin. NSW Nationals MP Mark Coulton made his first visit to Menindee on 7 February, more than a month after the fish kill was first reported. Guardian Australia reported at the time: The Nationals leader Michael McCormack has made his first visit to Menindee since the ecological disaster which led to the death of up to a million fish, claiming \u201cwe\u2019re all experts in hindsight\u201d. The deputy prime minister visited the fish-kill ground-zero site with local Nationals MP Mark Coulton, who was also making his first visit since the mass death was reported early last month. McCormack, who attempted to limit the water returned to the environment even further in the 2012 Murray-Darling Basin plan, calling it an \u201cassault on regional Australia\u201d, and had earlier prescribed the mass deaths to \u201cit just hasn\u2019t rained\u201d, told reporters \u201cwe\u2019re all experts in hindsight\u201d when asked if the river could have been managed better. Despite subjecting us all to a 150-minute question time, Scott Morrison says the government was never going to oppose a motion calling for a royal commission into disability abuse. Here is what he had to say on it yesterday: It won\u2019t be opposed by the government and was not going to be opposed by the government. I think this was one of another of the cruel lies that was put around last week. As prime minister I\u2019ve never opposed such a royal commission. My priority has been to establish the royal commission into aged care, which I have done, and to conclude the royal commission into the banking and finance industry, which I initiated, which I commissioned, which is just recently completed. So these were my priorities. We need to do everything we can to support Australians with a disability. And I\u2019m disappointed that on Thursday the Labor party chose to play politics with this issue. There was no suggestion that the government was not going to support that motion that afternoon in the House of Representatives and the motion was not going to even come to the House of Representatives that afternoon. And so to suggest other things I thought was disingenuous and dishonest. Except \u2013 that it was opposed by the government in the Senate. And question time was extended. Until 4.15pm. When any chance of the vote was moot. Despite the message not having come from the Senate, meaning the whole thing was for nothing anyway. The message will reach the House today and it will be agreed to. Jordon Steele-John will be joined by disability advocates and survivors to watch the motion. Earlier he told the ABC he wasn\u2019t expecting much from the government, despite the decision to wave it through: The government plans to not vote against this motion in the House today and then to send the attorney general out there mumbling nonsense about a need to consult with the between now and the federal election \u2013 I just want to say really clearly that is not good enough. The immigration minister, David Coleman, is attempting to explain to Laura Jayes and Kieran Gilbert on Sky News why the medical evacuation bill is going to dismantle the nation\u2019s border security regime, despite the government appointing the review panel that will look at any medical rejections. It\u2019s going well. Coleman says it\u2019s because it means the Australian government doesn\u2019t decide who comes here. Which is not true, because the Australian government appoints the panel which will review cases the minister rejects on medical grounds. And Coleman\u2019s argument also ignores the many, many cases the federal court has ruled on, which have overturned the minister\u2019s decision and brought asylum seekers and refugees here for medical treatment. Where they remain in detention. Welcome to the second week of parliament for 2019 \u2013 and the last before the budget is handed down. And presumedly, the election is called. There is a lot to fit in. The latest Fairfax-Ipsos poll is out and has Labor ahead 51 to 49 \u2013 but that is a fair shrinkage of the lead Labor had in December in the same poll, when it was 54 to 46. The poll was taken last week, as the medical evacuation bill debate was taking off. The government has decided to fight this election on border security, as well as the economy, so don\u2019t expect that to go away anytime soon. There are a lot of comparisons being made to 2001 when John Howard won the un-winnable election. Yes, there was the Tampa and 9/11. But he also started from a stronger position. He had 80 seats. This government has to win every seat it already holds plus four or so. So the fight isn\u2019t on, but it is not exactly the same. While the House deals with some leftovers from last week, with the Morrison government set to wave through the motion asking for a royal commission into disability abuse (the one that it opposed in the Senate last week, and then extended question time to a record time to avoid, but then said it was going to support the whole time anyway) as well as Labor\u2019s small business bills. That\u2019s to head off another defeat on the floor of the House. Over in the Senate, it\u2019s estimates time, with home affairs and that Paladin contract under the microscope. The Australian Financial Review has done excellent work on uncovering that secretive contract, which appears to have been awarded without any ministerial oversight. And Jenny Morrison has done an interview with 9Honey, saying her husband is a very sensitive man. And it\u2019s only 8am. Mike Bowers is on deck for you this morning, as are Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and the rest of the Guardian brains trust. Find us on Twitter or in the comments. I have found a coffee this morning, so the manic Monday is getting off to a good start. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

In a tense exchange in a Senate estimates hearing on Monday, senators Anne Urqhuart and Kristina Keneally asked the environment department and Coalition senator Simon Birmingham to explain the most recent emissions projections published by the government. On current trajectories, the department\u2019s report projects Australia\u2019s emissions will reach 563m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030, which would equal a 7% cut on 2005 emissions levels. Australia\u2019s target is for a 26-28% reduction on 2005 levels. The department told the hearing 2018 emissions levels reached 534m tonnes. Urquhart asked if this meant the country\u2019s emissions were increasing, but the department argued its numbers were \u201cconservative\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not a forecast of what is the potential to happen,\u201d said Jo Evans, the deputy secretary for climate change and energy innovation. \u201cI guess what I\u2019m saying is while it\u2019s a projection, it\u2019s very conservative.\u201d Evans told the hearing there were measures the department hadn\u2019t factored into its projections that could close the gap further, such as more technological innovation, or a change in policy. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has claimed Australia will meet its targets \u201cin a canter\u201d, but multiple quarterly emissions reports have shown the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions tracking upwards. Urquhart asked if it was correct that, based on the department\u2019s current data, Australia would miss its target by 19%. \u201cThe only way that would be a true statement is if nothing else happened between now and then ... either in unexpected ways or in changes or amendments to the current policy suite.\u201d But Keneally challenged the government on the extent to which current policies were working and what its confidence was based on that it could meet its commitments. Birmingham replied the current policies had \u201csteered\u201d the country towards beating its 2020 target. \u201cSo it\u2019s hope?\u201d Keneally said. \u201cWhen you assert that we are going to meet our targets, is it based on policies you have already announced or policies you intend to announce in future?\u201d Keneally asked. Birmingham said the government had made it clear it would be making further announcements on climate change policy leading up to the election. \u201cWe indeed are continually working, as the prime minister has publicly acknowledged, within government on further policy settings that will help to ensure we meet the same trajectory in relation to our 2030 commitments,\u201d he said. Keneally replied: \u201cSo if I could summarise, you\u2019re hoping that past performance is an indicator of future success and that future success will be predicated not on policies you\u2019ve already announced but on some things you\u2019ve yet to announce.\u201d Later in the hearing, the independent senator Tim Storer grilled the government on its intentions to rely on carryover credits from Kyoto to meet Australia\u2019s target. Birmingham said \u201cas has been made clear previously and as is consistent with the way in which the Kyoto agreement has worked previously, the government would intend to use carryover if required\u201d. Storer said the department\u2019s emissions projections data suggested Australia could rely on carryover credits from beating previous Kyoto targets to meet more than half of its international commitments. He asked if other countries intended to rely on carryover, which Birmingham said he would have to answer on notice. Richie Merzian, the director of The Australia Institute\u2019s climate and energy program, said it was little wonder school students were protesting about a lack of climate leadership at a national level. \u201cIt is disheartening to hear the government defend Australia\u2019s woeful climate policies and rising emissions in Senate estimates,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government confirmed it is openly using loopholes from a past agreement to meet over half its 2030 reduction target and doesn\u2019t share the view of neighbours like New Zealand that such dodgy practices are not in the spirit of the Paris Agreement.\u201d",

Following the release of a scathing report into Jobactive, the Australian Council of Social Service lashed the program as \u201charsh and unreasonable\u201d and noted Australia spent less than half the OECD average on employment services. The Jobactive program has been earmarked for review by the government, with the contract with providers set to expire in 2020. The inquiry report, released late last week, called for an overhaul of the program, which was resulting in people gaining employment \u201cin spite of Jobactive, not because of it\u201d. \u201cJobactive is not welfare to work, it is welfare to nowhere,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe government\u2019s punitive and paternalistic approach to employment services has failed.\u201d The Labor-chaired committee argued for a review into the rate of Newstart and criticised the Jobactive program as \u201cpunitive\u201d and in some cases \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d. \u201cParticipants are missing paid employment to attend appointments with their Jobactive provider,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe requirement to apply for 20 jobs every month burdens employers who are receiving masses of poor quality applications often from people who are not suited for the position.\u201d Among the flaws with the program was that jobseekers did not receive the \u201cbasic job-readiness services\u201d they were meant to, while consultants had an average caseload of 150 participants. Providers were also \u201crewarded financially for churning people through jobs that don\u2019t last\u201d. Goldie said the government needed to spend at least $500m in this year\u2019s budget for employment services even to reach \u201cat least half the OECD average level\u201d. \u201cMany parents and carers returning to paid work need career advice, help with childcare, and training to refresh their skills,\u201d Goldie told Guardian Australia. \u201cAs the Senate inquiry report shows, most receive none of these things. Instead, people now face a harsh bureaucratic nightmare that often does not help them get work, threatens to suspend their social security payments, and floods employers with unsuitable applications.\u201d Labor has indicated a desire to reduce the job search requirements, a move the government claimed would undermine the bipartisan commitment to \u201cmutual obligation\u201d within the welfare system. In a dissenting report, Coalition senators said while the jobactive program was \u201cfar from perfect\u201d it had \u201cperformed well and at a lower cost\u201d than previous programs. \u201cAround 50% of job seekers are in work three months after participating in Jobactive \u2013 compared to 42.5% for the last three years of the Job Services Australia model,\u201d the dissenting report said. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert said the government should scrap the compliance regime under which jobseekers lose payments for missing appointments. Guardian Australia reported earlier this month that nearly 20,000 homeless or homeless at risk people had been given a \u201cdemerit point\u201d warning under the \u201ctargeted compliance framework\u201d. The inquiry report said more than half of homeless jobseekers had at least one demerit point, a penalty that usually comes with a payment suspension. Overall, 42.5% of Jobactive participants have received at least one demerit point resulting in a payment suspension. \u201cIn addition, over 4,000 participants have more than five demerit points and are already in the \u2018penalty zone\u2019 \u2013 resulting in reduction or cancellation of their payment,\u201d the report said. The report also called for a review into Work for the Dole, a contentious aspect of the Jobactive program that requires people to spend six months on a work placement. Labor has said it will consider changes to Work for the Dole, but Siewert said the program should also be abolished. Jeremy Poxon, a spokesman for the Australian Unemployed Workers Union (AUWU), said the committee\u2019s report did not go far enough. He called for a return to a publicly run employment services system.",

The flat in Athens has been let out since 2014. This flat is also mortgaged as I took out a loan in 2005 to fund my masters degree. I have now managed to get enough money together to put down as a deposit on a flat in London and I am trying to figure out if I have to pay the higher rate of stamp duty or not and what can I do to avoid this. So I have the following questions: \u2022 Am I to pay the higher stamp duty rate of 3% or not? \u2022 Would it be possible to get the deed of the property I will buy in London to my niece\u2019s name (she is Greek national) and avoid the stamp duty? If this were possible, would she be considered a first-time buyer? \u2022 If I sell the flat in Athens before I buy a property in London would I still be required to pay the higher stamp duty? Any other suggestions on how to avoid the higher stamp duty would be very useful.

      "bodyText": "Scientists studying the 2015 Zika outbreak in Brazil have discovered that people previously exposed to dengue may have been protected from the virus. Three-quarters of the inhabitants of a favela in the country\u2019s north-east caught the mosquito-borne Zika virus during the epidemic. The outbreak left more than 3,000 babies across Brazil with microcephaly, a birth defect caused by mothers catching the virus during pregnancy. Federico Costa, a professor of epidemiology at the Federal University of Bahia, one of the authors of the study in the favela in Bahia\u2019s state capital Salvador, published in Science magazine, said it was the first time scientists had been able to conduct tests on one specific population before and after an outbreak. Costa said it was the most accurate research of this kind done to date. Albert Ko, a professor of medicine at the Yale School of Public Health and another of the report\u2019s authors, said: \u201cIt is the first [study] to really give a clue as to what happened when Zika came into the region in Brazil, which was hardest hit months later by microcephaly.\u201d Led by the Yale School of Public Health, the research team found that 73% of residents of the Pau da Lima favela in Salvador caught Zika between March and October 2015. Researchers examined 1,453 residents and found infection rates varied from 29% in some areas of the densely-populated favela to 83%in others. They also discovered that previous exposure to dengue protected people against Zika infection, and now believe that those who catch the virus \u2013 many of whom show no symptoms \u2013 subsequently become immune to it. Before 2015, Zika had been unknown in Brazil and was often misdiagnosed as dengue. Less than a year after the epidemic, a wave of newborn babies with abnormally small heads caused panic among Brazilians. As of November 2018, 3,279 cases of \u201cgrowth and development alterations possibly related to infection by the Zika virus and other infectious aetiologies\u201d had been confirmed by Brazil\u2019s health ministry, including 2,079 in the north-east. Numbers later faded away. With a population of roughly 57 million people, Brazil\u2019s impoverished north-east was completely unprotected against Zika. \u201c[The region] has all the perfect conditions to have a huge epidemic,\u201d said Isabel Rodriguez-Barraquer, assistant professor of medicine at the University of California in San Francisco, the lead author. First identified in monkeys in Uganda in 1947, Zika circulated for decades but was virtually ignored until an outbreak on the island of Yap in 2007. Brazilian authorities first confirmed the virus in the north-eastern states of Rio Grande do Norte and Bahia in May 2015. Doctors in the region began noticing an increase in newborns with microcephaly \u2013 until then, a rare condition. Cases mushroomed and, in December 2015, the Pan-American Health Organization issued an epidemiological alert. The Aedes aegypti mosquito, which spreads Zika and related viruses like dengue and Chikungunya, thrives in areas like Pau da Lima, where sanitation is poor and garbage is left uncollected. \u201cThere has been disordered growth, so people build on any land they can find,\u201d said Laiara dos Santos, 34, a nurse living in the community. \u201cPau da Lima has areas with no sanitation \u2026 they end up with open sewers.\u201d Dos Santos, who also caught Zika at the time, remembers the first baby she saw with microcephaly in the community \u2013 a little girl. \u201cThe mother did not know what was happening,\u201d she said. \u201cShe took her daughter and hugged her, she had a lot of love for the child, but she cried a lot.\u201d Ko said blood tests of favela residents dating from before the 2015 outbreak helped researchers discriminate between dengue and Zika, which can be hard to tell apart. \u201cPeople who were exposed to dengue before had antibodies and those antibodies protected them from Zika.\u201d Rodriguez-Barraquer believes many people in the Americas are now immune to Zika. \u201cThe epidemic just burned throughout the continent,\u201d she said. But the virus is still circulating in other parts of the world and the researchers believe their study will help those struggling to understand it. In December, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning over \u201can unusual increase in the number of Zika cases in Rajasthan and surrounding states\u201d, and advised pregnant women not to travel to the Indian state even though transmission by mosquitoes is more likely from August to November. Whether that leads to a rise in microcephaly cases depends on how much Zika has circulated previously. \u201cThe big question is: how bad was the transmission before and was it enough to essentially immunise women?\u201d said Ko.",

      "bodyText": "On a recent winter afternoon, several dozen residents of Duisburger Strasse in Berlin huddled together to commemorate the people on their street who died in the Holocaust. To Volker Spitzenberger, who has lived here since 2010 with his husband, the stories of local residents killed by the Nazis were a chilling reminder of past atrocities \u2013 but none more so than when the organiser mentioned Manfred Hirsch, a young boy who was deported at the age of four from the house at No 18. \u201cThat\u2019s our house,\u201d Spitzenberger said, with a sharp intake of breath. Monuments of remembrance are ubiquitous in Berlin. The city has at least 20 memorials to victims of the Holocaust \u2013 most notably Peter Eisenman\u2019s vast 19,000-sq metre Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. But the memorial envisioned for Hirsch is different. Just under 10 sq cm, it might be easy to miss: a small brass stone, embedded directly underfoot, in the cobblestones of the street. Known as \u201cStolpersteine\u201d, or \u201cstumbling stones\u201d, there are now more than 70,000 such memorial blocks laid in more than 1,200 cities and towns across Europe and Russia. Each commemorates a victim outside their last-known freely chosen residence. The stones represent a new vision of urban remembrance. If Eisenman\u2019s large monument, set in the governmental heart of Berlin, emphasises the scale and political culpability of the Holocaust, the Stolpersteine focus on its individual tragedies. The inscription on each stone begins \u201cHere lived\u201d, followed by the victim\u2019s name, date of birth, and fate: internment, suicide, exile or, in the vast majority of cases, deportation and murder. Together, the Stolpersteine now constitute the largest decentralised monument in the world. \u201cI find it much more moving than these colossal or labyrinthine memorials, which to me feel quite bombastic and anonymous,\u201d says Marion Papi, a translator and writer who also lives a few doors down from Spitzenberger on Duisburger Strasse. \u201cThe Stolpersteine are so much more vivid and personal.\u201d The idea was first conceived by artist Gunter Demnig in Cologne in 1992 as part of an initiative commemorating Roma and Sinti victims of the Holocaust. He installed the first Berlin Stolperstein four years later. He has now laid over 70,000 stones, personally overseeing the wording and installation of each one. The task keeps him on the road for 300 days a year. \u201cA person is only forgotten when his or her name is forgotten,\u201d he often says, citing the Talmud. Today, the Stolpersteine exist in 20 languages and 24 countries. In 2017, the Pestalozzi school in Buenos Aires became the first site outside Europe to host one, honouring hundreds of German Jewish children who found refuge there in exile. Unlike some other memorials that focus on specific persecuted groups, the Stolpersteine honour all victims of the Nazi regime, including Jewish, Sinti, Roma, disabled, dissident, and Afro-German and \u201casocial\u201d citizens. The 70,000th Stolperstein was laid for Willy Zimmerer, a German man with learning disabilities murdered at Hadamar psychiatric hospital outside of Frankfurt. Despite its vast and international scope, the Stolpersteine remain a grassroots initiative. Local groups \u2013 often residents of a particular street, or schoolchildren working on a project \u2013 come together to research the biographies of local victims, and to raise the \u20ac120 it costs to install each stone. On Duisburger Strasse, Norbert and Astrid Wollsch\u00e4ger invited everyone in their apartment building to join in. About half agreed. \u201cWe would go in pairs to the archives,\u201d says Wollschl\u00e4ger. \u201cIt really knocks it out of you.\u201d The Nazis kept meticulous records, he says. \u201cRight down to the last silver spoon a victim left behind.\u201d Though emotionally exhausting, the project bonded the Wollschl\u00e4gers closer to their neighbours. \u201cWe met regularly and talked about our progress.

      "body": "<p>John Slater, a former railway worker who lives in Boston, Lincolnshire, was 40 when he first went to the doctor with gut problems. Along with \u201ccolossal\u201d lower abdominal cramps, he had started passing blood from his rectum. His doctor thought he had irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and then, when the bleeding worsened, an ulcer was suspected. It wasn\u2019t until Slater ended up in A&amp;E, after 12 years of debilitating symptoms, that a colonoscopy revealed adhesions in his bowel lining. \u201cThe walls were fused together,\u201d is how Slater puts it.</p> <p>The cause turned out to be a rare and extreme form of diverticulosis \u2013 a complication arising from the formation of pouches in the bowel lining known as diverticulitis. The presence of such pouches usually affects westerners over 50, with the incidence increasing with age.</p> <p>A section of Slater\u2019s small bowel had to be removed, along with his appendix. \u201cThere\u2019s now a mesh attached to my spine to hold the bowel up,\u201d he says. But two inoperable pouches remain. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting for one of them to suddenly wake up and then it will start again. I\u2019m living day to day.\u201d Meanwhile, he still has intermittent bleeding and is on medication for pain and to help his bowel function, along with a medium-fibre diet with plenty of fresh fruit, and wants to raise awareness of the condition.</p> <p>While Slater\u2019s case is unusual, diverticulosis is very common, says Robin Spiller, professor of gastroenterology at the University of Nottingham. \u201cIf you do postmortems on people, 40% of 65- to 74-year-olds will have diverticulosis, and many of them will never have had any symptoms.\u201d Some people \u201chave one little pouch which, of course, doesn\u2019t do anything, while others can have 20-100 of them\u201d. Most people remain blissfully unaware they have the pouches at all.</p> <p>Trouble can occur when the pouches get pellets of fibrous material, known as fecaliths, lodged in them. This can be harmless, but will in some people lead to infection and inflammation and, in rare cases, perforation of the gut, causing intestinal waste to leak into the abdominal cavity.</p> <p>Calculating how many of the 40% with diverticulosis will experience any trouble is difficult, Spiller says, \u201cbut it\u2019s probably something like one in 10\u201d. Hospitalisation will only be necessary when serious complications occur. \u201cAbout 1% of the (UK) population could expect to be hospitalised with diverticulitis in their lifetime,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdb7bfd1a406166f50fe28967db7b4dd03ed748a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdb7bfd1a406166f50fe28967db7b4dd03ed748a/0_74_6016_3608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There are people who get pain every day, which lasts a few hours, maybe precipitated by food ...\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There are people who get pain every day, which lasts a few hours, maybe precipitated by food ...\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much of the time, fecaliths lurking in diverticular pouches aren\u2019t remotely sinister. The trouble occurs, Spiller says, \u201cif food residue gets stuck in there and puts pressure on the lining, which is very thin. Then it might cause a break in the lining and that might let bacteria in and cause inflammation.\u201d Sometimes the pouches bleed and the worst-case scenario, he says, is if the walls burst. That condition, known as peritonitis, can be life-threatening.</p> <p>Diverticulitis is usually relatively straightforward to diagnose and treat, says Spiller. \u201cYou\u2019ll get a fever, a raised white blood cell count, pain and tenderness \u2013 similar symptoms to appendicitis.\u201d You might be hospitalised, but most cases can be treated with antibiotics. Infection can recur intermittently: \u201cA quarter will get another attack in the next year.\u201d</p> <p>What is more difficult to diagnose is when patients have pain related to the diverticular pouches, but no infection. \u201cThere are people who get pain every day, which lasts a few hours, maybe precipitated by food. This is very difficult to distinguish from IBS,\u201d says Spiller. In such cases, it may be that another underlying problem, such as \u201cincoordinate contractions\u201d, is causing both the pouches to form and the pain. Contractions in the bowel, Spiller explains, \u201care carefully controlled to move things along or hold them back. But if you have damage to the nerves, from ageing, for example, then these coordinations fail and that puts the pressure up.\u201d</p> <p>Part of the reason the risk increases with age is that connective tissue weakens. While on the outside this leads to skin wrinkles, says Spiller, \u201cinternally, a weaker colon wall can lead to pouch formation\u201d.</p> <p>Diverticulosis is a peculiarly western affliction, but Spiller says none of the theories about why this may be are proven by scientific study: \u201cMany of them are probably wrong.\u201d However, it is almost certainly linked to diet or environment. Diverticular disease is rare in Africa and Asia and <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.02805.x\" title=\"\">studies have shown that the longer people from these areas</a> live in North America or Europe, the higher their risk grows. </p> <p>\u201cSomething has made our colons not as strong as they should be,\u201d Spiller says.</p> <p>A diet lacking in fibre gets most of the blame, but Spiller says the evidence is weak. The most-quoted study looked at data from 43,881 male healthcare professionals, but it only shows associations rather than causation. The study found that both consumers of high-fibre diets and dedicated exercisers had the lowest diverticular disease risks. \u201cYou could say these people were more health-conscious overall and most of their diseases are less,\u201d says Spiller.</p> <p>There are other elements of the western diet that could be weakening our guts. \u201cIt could be high fat,\u201d says Spiller. \u201cSome have argued that the bacteria are different in people with diverticulitis, but there\u2019s very little evidence on that at the moment.\u201d There may even be other, non-dietary aspects of the western lifestyle that have an effect.</p> <p>The precise cause, he says, could only be established through long-term randomised trials with subjects consuming either a high-fibre or a low-fibre diet and then followed for 10-20 years \u2013 but this would be prohibitively expensive and unlikely to attract many participants. Meanwhile, this common condition, which Spiller says \u201ccan seriously impair the quality of life of elderly people, is neglected because it\u2019s not an easy problem, and the fact that it doesn\u2019t affect young people works against it. But I do think we need to raise awareness and more work should be done. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "John Slater, a former railway worker who lives in Boston, Lincolnshire, was 40 when he first went to the doctor with gut problems. Along with \u201ccolossal\u201d lower abdominal cramps, he had started passing blood from his rectum. His doctor thought he had irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and then, when the bleeding worsened, an ulcer was suspected. It wasn\u2019t until Slater ended up in A&amp;E, after 12 years of debilitating symptoms, that a colonoscopy revealed adhesions in his bowel lining. \u201cThe walls were fused together,\u201d is how Slater puts it. The cause turned out to be a rare and extreme form of diverticulosis \u2013 a complication arising from the formation of pouches in the bowel lining known as diverticulitis. The presence of such pouches usually affects westerners over 50, with the incidence increasing with age. A section of Slater\u2019s small bowel had to be removed, along with his appendix. \u201cThere\u2019s now a mesh attached to my spine to hold the bowel up,\u201d he says. But two inoperable pouches remain. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting for one of them to suddenly wake up and then it will start again. I\u2019m living day to day.\u201d Meanwhile, he still has intermittent bleeding and is on medication for pain and to help his bowel function, along with a medium-fibre diet with plenty of fresh fruit, and wants to raise awareness of the condition. While Slater\u2019s case is unusual, diverticulosis is very common, says Robin Spiller, professor of gastroenterology at the University of Nottingham. \u201cIf you do postmortems on people, 40% of 65- to 74-year-olds will have diverticulosis, and many of them will never have had any symptoms.\u201d Some people \u201chave one little pouch which, of course, doesn\u2019t do anything, while others can have 20-100 of them\u201d. Most people remain blissfully unaware they have the pouches at all. Trouble can occur when the pouches get pellets of fibrous material, known as fecaliths, lodged in them. This can be harmless, but will in some people lead to infection and inflammation and, in rare cases, perforation of the gut, causing intestinal waste to leak into the abdominal cavity. Calculating how many of the 40% with diverticulosis will experience any trouble is difficult, Spiller says, \u201cbut it\u2019s probably something like one in 10\u201d. Hospitalisation will only be necessary when serious complications occur. \u201cAbout 1% of the (UK) population could expect to be hospitalised with diverticulitis in their lifetime,\u201d he says. Much of the time, fecaliths lurking in diverticular pouches aren\u2019t remotely sinister. The trouble occurs, Spiller says, \u201cif food residue gets stuck in there and puts pressure on the lining, which is very thin. Then it might cause a break in the lining and that might let bacteria in and cause inflammation.\u201d Sometimes the pouches bleed and the worst-case scenario, he says, is if the walls burst. That condition, known as peritonitis, can be life-threatening. Diverticulitis is usually relatively straightforward to diagnose and treat, says Spiller. \u201cYou\u2019ll get a fever, a raised white blood cell count, pain and tenderness \u2013 similar symptoms to appendicitis.\u201d You might be hospitalised, but most cases can be treated with antibiotics. Infection can recur intermittently: \u201cA quarter will get another attack in the next year.\u201d What is more difficult to diagnose is when patients have pain related to the diverticular pouches, but no infection. \u201cThere are people who get pain every day, which lasts a few hours, maybe precipitated by food. This is very difficult to distinguish from IBS,\u201d says Spiller. In such cases, it may be that another underlying problem, such as \u201cincoordinate contractions\u201d, is causing both the pouches to form and the pain. Contractions in the bowel, Spiller explains, \u201care carefully controlled to move things along or hold them back. But if you have damage to the nerves, from ageing, for example, then these coordinations fail and that puts the pressure up.\u201d Part of the reason the risk increases with age is that connective tissue weakens. While on the outside this leads to skin wrinkles, says Spiller, \u201cinternally, a weaker colon wall can lead to pouch formation\u201d. Diverticulosis is a peculiarly western affliction, but Spiller says none of the theories about why this may be are proven by scientific study: \u201cMany of them are probably wrong.\u201d However, it is almost certainly linked to diet or environment. Diverticular disease is rare in Africa and Asia and studies have shown that the longer people from these areas live in North America or Europe, the higher their risk grows. \u201cSomething has made our colons not as strong as they should be,\u201d Spiller says. A diet lacking in fibre gets most of the blame, but Spiller says the evidence is weak. The most-quoted study looked at data from 43,881 male healthcare professionals, but it only shows associations rather than causation. The study found that both consumers of high-fibre diets and dedicated exercisers had the lowest diverticular disease risks. \u201cYou could say these people were more health-conscious overall and most of their diseases are less,\u201d says Spiller. There are other elements of the western diet that could be weakening our guts. \u201cIt could be high fat,\u201d says Spiller. \u201cSome have argued that the bacteria are different in people with diverticulitis, but there\u2019s very little evidence on that at the moment.\u201d There may even be other, non-dietary aspects of the western lifestyle that have an effect. The precise cause, he says, could only be established through long-term randomised trials with subjects consuming either a high-fibre or a low-fibre diet and then followed for 10-20 years \u2013 but this would be prohibitively expensive and unlikely to attract many participants. Meanwhile, this common condition, which Spiller says \u201ccan seriously impair the quality of life of elderly people, is neglected because it\u2019s not an easy problem, and the fact that it doesn\u2019t affect young people works against it. But I do think we need to raise awareness and more work should be done. It\u2019s important.\u201d",

He rather claimed them as his birthright \u2013 they were the brutalised opinions of his father and brothers.

The author does not so much put words into his old man\u2019s mouth as seek to find some hard-won common ground with him. It is a kind of love letter, but one that admits only the <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2019/02/04/the-pain-never-went-away/\" title=\"\">bluntest truths</a>: \u201cOne night, in the village cafe, you said in front of everyone that you wished you\u2019d had another son instead of me.

In particular, he captures the gap in self-knowledge between them in sentences that narrow in, Beckett-like, on the texture of the life he left behind near Abbeville in northern France: \u201cNothing was unexpected any more because you no longer had any expectations, nothing was violent because violence wasn\u2019t what you called it, you called it life, you didn\u2019t call it, it was there, it was.\u201d</p> <p>Louis clings to straws of shared experience.

Having established these few strands of connection, Louis names and shames those successive presidents and their ideologies that have stripped hope from his father, and left the family so threadbare: Jacques Chirac, who \u201cdestroyed your intestines\u201d by withdrawing subsidy for medications for chronic conditions; Nicolas Sarkozy, who skewered his father\u2019s self-worth first with a campaign against \u201cles assist\u00e9s\u201d (the \u201cskivers\u201d and \u201cscroungers\u201d of the austerity lexicon) and who then \u201cincentivised\u201d him back to work as a street sweeper after his disability benefits were cut; Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who relaxed regulation to allow employers to extend his father\u2019s hours; and finally Emmanuel Macron, who reduced housing subsidy by a critical five euros a week, while reducing taxes on the rich. Not surprisingly, Louis has, in recent months, been canvassed for his views on the gilets jaunes who share much of this analysis of recent French political history. In his longest reply to those requests, he wrote that when he watched the protests on TV, the faces and bodies looked like \u201cthe bodies of my family\u201d, hence the fact that he \u201cfelt personally targeted by the scorn and violence of the bourgeoisie who immediately fell on this movement. Because, in me, for me, every person who insulted a yellow vest insulted my father.\u201d The sentiments in that response, and in this small book, are not straightforwardly persuasive, and they offer few interesting answers. Louis sacrifices some of the nuance of his first novel for a more bludgeoning polemical directness. The result, even so, speaks with an emotional authenticity and a stylistic confidence that is hard to ignore. \u2022 Who Killed My Father by \u00c9douard Louis (translated by Lorin Stein) is published by Harvill Secker (\u00a310.99).

It makes me think first of a network of paths \u2013 and then of how lives are spent sometimes in solitude, sometimes surrounded by loved ones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4c4170649f8986c6d812185d841badb7288349c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c4170649f8986c6d812185d841badb7288349c1/0_83_1479_887/1000.png\" alt=\"Cornwall route map\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>OK, it\u2019s not exactly Nietzsche, but pleasant philosophical musings typify my three days on the Cornish Celtic Way: a new long-distance walking route that takes visitors away from many of the county\u2019s over-visited spots. Dreamed up by a 55-year-old clergyman, the 125-mile trail joins existing paths, bridleways and back roads from sleepy St Germans on the River Tiddy to the coastal village of Downderry, before taking the coast path \u2013 further-flung sections of which are wonderfully quiet \u2013 all the way to Polruan at the mouth of the River Fowey. After a ferry across to Fowey town, there\u2019s a northerly traverse through quiet countryside to Padstow, before rejoining the coast path \u2013 with occasional detours inland.</p> <p>Swerving south before busy St Ives, the route heads back across the county and finishes at the small tidal island of St Michael\u2019s Mount. That amounts to 16 stages which can be completed in two weeks at a leisurely pace, or done in smaller sections.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.cornishcelticway.co.uk/product/cornish-celtic-way-book/\" title=\"\">eponymous laminated guidebook</a> to the route (\u00a315) is written by the Reverend Nigel Marns, vicar at the 14th-century St Paul\u2019s church in Ludgvan, near Marazion, one of the stars of stage 15.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"406f76d4b3084bd48ce36a7533090133a0b90f06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/406f76d4b3084bd48ce36a7533090133a0b90f06/0_0_7765_4659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view down Fore Street in Polruan looking towards Fowey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A view down Fore Street in Polruan looking towards Fowey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Lunt/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a delightful publication, with directions accompanied by poems, songs, quotations, suggestions for activities \u2013 such as the Downderry pebble pick-up \u2013 and questions for contemplation, around qualities such as patience. And it\u2019s not overly religious.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to do something a bit new,\u201d says Marns, who also runs guided group walks on the route. \u201cIt\u2019s not purely a hiking guide instructing you to turn left at the third hedge, nor a dry historical text.\u201d</p> <p>It works for me. As I ramble from St Germans to narrow-laned Polperro over two days, and then across country from the outskirts of St Ives to Marazion in one more, the book provides succour and perspective.

      "bodyText": "On the strand at Downderry, my guidebook suggests, I should pick up a pebble. \u201cChoose one to mark the start of your journey,\u201d it counsels. I settle on a charcoal-coloured stone featuring lots of vaguely psychedelic parallel pink lines. Some diverge and thicken as others separate, going solo. It makes me think first of a network of paths \u2013 and then of how lives are spent sometimes in solitude, sometimes surrounded by loved ones. OK, it\u2019s not exactly Nietzsche, but pleasant philosophical musings typify my three days on the Cornish Celtic Way: a new long-distance walking route that takes visitors away from many of the county\u2019s over-visited spots. Dreamed up by a 55-year-old clergyman, the 125-mile trail joins existing paths, bridleways and back roads from sleepy St Germans on the River Tiddy to the coastal village of Downderry, before taking the coast path \u2013 further-flung sections of which are wonderfully quiet \u2013 all the way to Polruan at the mouth of the River Fowey. After a ferry across to Fowey town, there\u2019s a northerly traverse through quiet countryside to Padstow, before rejoining the coast path \u2013 with occasional detours inland. Swerving south before busy St Ives, the route heads back across the county and finishes at the small tidal island of St Michael\u2019s Mount. That amounts to 16 stages which can be completed in two weeks at a leisurely pace, or done in smaller sections. The eponymous laminated guidebook to the route (\u00a315) is written by the Reverend Nigel Marns, vicar at the 14th-century St Paul\u2019s church in Ludgvan, near Marazion, one of the stars of stage 15. It\u2019s a delightful publication, with directions accompanied by poems, songs, quotations, suggestions for activities \u2013 such as the Downderry pebble pick-up \u2013 and questions for contemplation, around qualities such as patience. And it\u2019s not overly religious. \u201cI\u2019m trying to do something a bit new,\u201d says Marns, who also runs guided group walks on the route. \u201cIt\u2019s not purely a hiking guide instructing you to turn left at the third hedge, nor a dry historical text.\u201d It works for me. As I ramble from St Germans to narrow-laned Polperro over two days, and then across country from the outskirts of St Ives to Marazion in one more, the book provides succour and perspective. Take the moment when, sweary after being stung by a nettle outside Seaton, I open it to find an excerpt from Dostoevsky\u2019s The Brothers Karamazov. \u201cLove the animals, love the plants, love everything,\u201d it urges. \u201cIf you love everything you will perceive the divine mystery in all things.\u201d A bit on the hippy side, perhaps, but I grit my teeth and try to love the nettle. There are some biblical passages (the Celtic Way is intended as a pilgrimage route, after all) but the trail, and the book, will also appeal to anyone fond of history or mysticism. Celtic crosses \u2013 stone Christian crosses topped with a ring, common to regions evangelised by Irish missionaries between the 9th and 12th centuries \u2013 regularly appear, while standing stones await at St Breock. And close to Perranporth is St Piran\u2019s Oratory, a haunting duneside ruin. And, of course, like Spain\u2019s Camino de Santiago pilgrimage routes, the Celtic Way can be undertaken purely as a hiking challenge. There are lusty hills to climb for majestic views. There are flower-festooned lanes blitzed by butterflies in summer, rust-coloured woodlands in autumn. There are white sand beaches galore, and plenty of highlights: Treffry Viaduct, pretty Fowey and, finally, St Michael\u2019s Mount itself. Being car-free and getting off the beaten track is the biggest bonus. This is a walk for Christians and those of other faiths or none at all. \u201cWe live in an era beset by crises, be they ecological or humanitarian, and I think pilgrims or people on a journey often carry those problems with them \u2013 as well as their own worries,\u201d says Marns. \u201cWalking pace allows for the gathering of thoughts \u2013 a chance to work things out.\u201d Still, at certain times, all pondering must be interrupted to settle a timeless dilemma: left or right?

Among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/key-points-from-parliamentary-inquiry-into-disinformation\">key points</a>, it says Facebook has failed to tackle attempts by Russia to manipulate elections; warns British electoral law is too weak to stop foreign interference; and concludes that the Cambridge Analytica scandal was facilitated by Facebook\u2019s policies.</p> <p>The report cites Germany \u2013 where tech companies are required by law to remove hate speech within 24 hours or face a \u20ac20m (\u00a317.5m) fine \u2013 as an example to follow. \u201cSocial media companies cannot hide behind the claim of being merely a \u2018platform\u2019 and maintain that they have no responsibility themselves in regulating the content of their sites.\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, refused three demands to give evidence to the committee.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Europe told to deal with Isis fighters \u2013 </strong>Donald Trump has called for EU countries to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/17/islamic-state-isis-baghuz-trump-calls-on-european-allies-to-take-800-fighters-captured-in-syria\">repatriate and put on trial the 800 Islamic State combatants from Europe</a> who have been captured in Syria by US-backed forces. \u201cThe alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them,\u201d said the president. \u201cThe US does not want to watch as these Isis fighters permeate Europe, which is where they are expected to go.\u201d A young Isis mother, Hoda Muthana, now 24, from Alabama, is in the al-Hawl refugee camp in north-eastern Syria. After fleeing to Turkey and then Syria in 2014, her Twitter feed was full of inciteful posts.

Ryanair and easyJet have said they will offer special prices on some routes to stranded Flybmi passengers. The airline, which says it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/17/flybmi-tells-customers-to-seek-refunds-from-credit-card-companies\">called in administrators partly because of Brexit uncertainty</a>, operated more than 600 flights a week from regional airports including Bristol, Newcastle, Aberdeen and East Midlands. Flybmi\u2019s Glasgow-based sister company Loganair says it will step in and take over five of Flybmi\u2019s routes from March and look at the airline\u2019s wider network, as well as possibly taking on some of its pilots, crew and ground staff.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Backstop stuck fast \u2013 </strong>Theresa May has written to every Tory MP telling them she will try to eliminate the risk of the Brexit backstop being applied indefinitely and urging them to \u201cmove beyond what divides us and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/17/brexit-may-risks-fresh-confrontation-erg-backstop\">sacrifice personal preferences for the national interest</a>\u201d. This week, May will speak to every EU leader and meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, as she seeks a reopening of the withdrawal text. Today, Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, will meet the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to discuss proposals to replace the backstop. On Tuesday, Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, will set out how the government thinks the backstop problem can be legally solved. Tobias Ellwood, one of May\u2019s defence ministers, has said he will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/17/minister-tobias-ellwood-plans-vote-against-government-stop-no-deal-brexit\">vote against the government if necessary</a> to prevent a no-deal Brexit. On the Labour side, there are calls this morning for restive MPs to stay the course rather than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/17/labour-mps-warned-quit-the-party-and-risk-a-decade-of-tory-rule\">quitting in protest at Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership on Brexit</a> and other issues including antisemitism.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Administrative coup\u2019 attempt on Trump \u2013 </strong>Republicans have called for an investigation over claims that officials discussed invoking the constitution to remove Donald Trump from the presidency. Andrew McCabe, whom Trump fired as acting FBI director in March 2018, told CBS that the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein sounded out members of Trump\u2019s cabinet regarding the 25th amendment to the constitution and its as-yet-unused provision for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/17/trump-ally-graham-will-subpoena-mccabe-and-rosenstein-over-coup\">removal of a president deemed incapable of discharging his duties</a>. Rosenstein also offered to wear a wire to gather evidence against Trump, 60 Minutes reported. Rosenstein \u2013 who perhaps remarkably is still deputy attorney general \u2013 has denied the claims. McCabe told 60 Minutes that Trump told intelligence officials \u201cI don\u2019t care. I believe Putin,\u201d when they apparently contradicted the Russian president in warning of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/18/i-believe-putin-trump-dismissed-us-advice-on-north-korea-threat-says-mccabe\">danger posed to the US by North Korean missiles</a>.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Whitewash\u2019 claim over Grenfell \u2013 </strong>Firefighters fear they are being \u201cstitched up\u201d in the Grenfell Tower inquiry because their role has already been heavily scrutinised while the failings of government and building companies have not. A Channel 4 Dispatches documentary tonight will report that 55 of the people who died had taken the fire brigade\u2019s advice to \u201cstay put\u201d. But Matt Wrack, the general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, countered: \u201cThe only thing they did on the night was turn up to put a fire out and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/18/firefighters-worry-being-stitched-up-by-grenfell-inquiry\">yet they are the people that have come under the most scrutiny so far</a>.\u201d Planning and decision-making involved in the refurbishment of Grenfell using combustible materials might not be examined until the beginning of next year \u2013 by which time, the firefighters\u2019 union argues, public attention will have waned.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Bottle backslide? </strong>Michael Gove has been urged to stick to plans to pay people for recycling bottles and cans, after a consultation revealed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/18/gove-limit-bottle-deposit-scheme-small-containers\">\u201cdeposit return\u201d scheme</a> might only apply to drinks of less than 750ml. Including all plastic and glass bottles, as well as cans, in such schemes regardless of their size has hugely increased recycling in some European countries. Separately, Gove wants to tax the production and import of plastic packaging with less than 30% recycled content.</p> <h2>Today in Focus podcast: Brexit and the European Schools project</h2> <p>When writer Peter Pomerantsev was a teenager, he was sent to one of the European Schools, which count Boris Johnson among their alumnae.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Urgent need for social media regulation, say MPs Hello, it\u2019s Warren Murray shaking the tree of news to see what falls out. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s social network deliberately broke privacy and competition law and must be brought under regulation, according to a devastating parliamentary report denouncing the company and its executives as \u201cdigital gangsters\u201d. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee says its 18-month investigation into disinformation and fake news was deliberately obstructed by Facebook. Among key points, it says Facebook has failed to tackle attempts by Russia to manipulate elections; warns British electoral law is too weak to stop foreign interference; and concludes that the Cambridge Analytica scandal was facilitated by Facebook\u2019s policies. The report cites Germany \u2013 where tech companies are required by law to remove hate speech within 24 hours or face a \u20ac20m (\u00a317.5m) fine \u2013 as an example to follow. \u201cSocial media companies cannot hide behind the claim of being merely a \u2018platform\u2019 and maintain that they have no responsibility themselves in regulating the content of their sites.\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, refused three demands to give evidence to the committee. * * * Europe told to deal with Isis fighters \u2013 Donald Trump has called for EU countries to repatriate and put on trial the 800 Islamic State combatants from Europe who have been captured in Syria by US-backed forces. \u201cThe alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them,\u201d said the president. \u201cThe US does not want to watch as these Isis fighters permeate Europe, which is where they are expected to go.\u201d A young Isis mother, Hoda Muthana, now 24, from Alabama, is in the al-Hawl refugee camp in north-eastern Syria. After fleeing to Turkey and then Syria in 2014, her Twitter feed was full of inciteful posts. Now, she says: \u201cI was really young and ignorant and I was 19 when I decided to leave. I believe that America gives second chances. I want to return and I\u2019ll never come back to the Middle East.\u201d Meanwhile Shamima Begum, the British teenager who also married into Isis in Syria, has given birth to a son in the al-Hawl camp and repeated her call to be allowed home: \u201cYou know, I didn\u2019t know what I was getting into when I left. I was hoping that maybe for the sake of me and my child they let me come back.\u201d * * * Goodbye Flybmi \u2013 Customers of the collapsed airline Flybmi are being told to seek refunds from their credit card companies or rebook with its partner airlines. Ryanair and easyJet have said they will offer special prices on some routes to stranded Flybmi passengers. The airline, which says it called in administrators partly because of Brexit uncertainty, operated more than 600 flights a week from regional airports including Bristol, Newcastle, Aberdeen and East Midlands. Flybmi\u2019s Glasgow-based sister company Loganair says it will step in and take over five of Flybmi\u2019s routes from March and look at the airline\u2019s wider network, as well as possibly taking on some of its pilots, crew and ground staff. * * * Backstop stuck fast \u2013 Theresa May has written to every Tory MP telling them she will try to eliminate the risk of the Brexit backstop being applied indefinitely and urging them to \u201cmove beyond what divides us and sacrifice personal preferences for the national interest\u201d. This week, May will speak to every EU leader and meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, as she seeks a reopening of the withdrawal text. Today, Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, will meet the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to discuss proposals to replace the backstop. On Tuesday, Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, will set out how the government thinks the backstop problem can be legally solved. Tobias Ellwood, one of May\u2019s defence ministers, has said he will vote against the government if necessary to prevent a no-deal Brexit. On the Labour side, there are calls this morning for restive MPs to stay the course rather than quitting in protest at Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership on Brexit and other issues including antisemitism. * * * \u2018Administrative coup\u2019 attempt on Trump \u2013 Republicans have called for an investigation over claims that officials discussed invoking the constitution to remove Donald Trump from the presidency. Andrew McCabe, whom Trump fired as acting FBI director in March 2018, told CBS that the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein sounded out members of Trump\u2019s cabinet regarding the 25th amendment to the constitution and its as-yet-unused provision for the removal of a president deemed incapable of discharging his duties. Rosenstein also offered to wear a wire to gather evidence against Trump, 60 Minutes reported. Rosenstein \u2013 who perhaps remarkably is still deputy attorney general \u2013 has denied the claims. McCabe told 60 Minutes that Trump told intelligence officials \u201cI don\u2019t care. I believe Putin,\u201d when they apparently contradicted the Russian president in warning of the danger posed to the US by North Korean missiles. * * * \u2018Whitewash\u2019 claim over Grenfell \u2013 Firefighters fear they are being \u201cstitched up\u201d in the Grenfell Tower inquiry because their role has already been heavily scrutinised while the failings of government and building companies have not. A Channel 4 Dispatches documentary tonight will report that 55 of the people who died had taken the fire brigade\u2019s advice to \u201cstay put\u201d. But Matt Wrack, the general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, countered: \u201cThe only thing they did on the night was turn up to put a fire out and yet they are the people that have come under the most scrutiny so far.\u201d Planning and decision-making involved in the refurbishment of Grenfell using combustible materials might not be examined until the beginning of next year \u2013 by which time, the firefighters\u2019 union argues, public attention will have waned. * * * Bottle backslide? Michael Gove has been urged to stick to plans to pay people for recycling bottles and cans, after a consultation revealed the \u201cdeposit return\u201d scheme might only apply to drinks of less than 750ml. Including all plastic and glass bottles, as well as cans, in such schemes regardless of their size has hugely increased recycling in some European countries. Separately, Gove wants to tax the production and import of plastic packaging with less than 30% recycled content. Today in Focus podcast: Brexit and the European Schools project When writer Peter Pomerantsev was a teenager, he was sent to one of the European Schools, which count Boris Johnson among their alumnae. He discusses what the project tells us about the EU. And: the Guardian\u2019s UK technology editor Alex Hern on advances in artificial intelligence. Lunchtime read: Ilhan Omar takes her place in the spotlight In January, Ilhan Omar made history as the first Somali American and one of the first Muslim women to be sworn into the US Congress. Since then she\u2019s had to apologise for comments that Democratic leaders called \u201cantisemitic tropes and prejudicial accusations\u201d. Then her intense grilling of Elliott Abrams, a Trump official and longtime establishment figure, sparked more headlines. Omar has emerged as a key bogeyman for Republicans, who have relentlessly attacked her views on Israeli-Palestinian relations. Wajahat Ali from the New York Times hails her as \u201ca young, bold progressive willing to take on and challenge some of Washington DC\u2019s sacred cows\u201d. But he concedes: \u201cShe\u2019s learning it goes both ways \u2026 she\u2019s a bit green and needs to be more sensitive with her language. But there\u2019s also a target on her because she\u2019s Muslim and a black woman. Let\u2019s not fool ourselves.\u201d Sport Ryan Giggs, the Wales manager, tells Donald McRae about the loneliness of his job, what Manchester United should do next and why he turned to a psychologist. Chris Gayle, the veteran West Indies opener and self-styled \u201cUniverse Boss\u201d, has claimed he is the greatest player in the world and warned English cricket that The Hundred will not be a success unless he is invited. Centre Brett Morris scored three tries in a 20-8 victory over Wigan to give the Sydney Roosters their fourth victory in the World Club Challenge. England have suffered a major blow in the buildup to their Six Nations grand slam eliminator against Wales on Saturday after Chris Ashton was ruled out with a calf strain. The UK Athletics performance director, Neil Black, has defended the bizarre policy that has led to only one British male sprinter being selected for the European Indoor Championships in Glasgow. Swansea swept into the FA Cup quarter-finals with a 4-1 defeat of Brentford, who were down to 10 men after a second-half red card for Ezri Konsa, while Manchester City cruised through to the Women\u2019s FA Cup quarters with a 3-0 over Tottenham Ladies. And the former Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova has been criticised for \u201cdisturbing, upsetting, and deeply transphobic\u201d comments after she argued that allowing transgender women to compete in women\u2019s sporting tournaments was \u201cinsane and cheating\u201d. Business A very interesting survey out today shows that skills shortages in British industry are helping to push up wages. Manufacturing companies are being worst hit, according to the survey of more than 1,200 employers, in a sign that industry concern about slowing immigration after Brexit could make it harder to fill vacancies. Asia-Pacific markets have bounced this morning on optimism about US-China trade talks (we\u2019ve heard that one before) but the FTSE100 is set to open flat. The pound is at $1.29 and \u20ac1.141.

      "bodyText": "Almost 4,000 assaults were reported in Australian nursing homes last financial year, but the real number is likely to be much higher, the aged care royal commission has heard. The federal health department secretary, Glenys Beauchamp, told the commission on Monday the 2017-18 figure of 3,773 assaults did not include incidents in which a cognitively impaired elderly person attacked another resident. Beauchamp insisted assault allegations were followed up and referred to appropriate authorities, including police. Following the Oakden nursing home scandal in Adelaide, a 2017 review by Kate Carnell and Ron Paterson recommended a \u201cserious incident response scheme\u201d. Beauchamp said the scheme was under development and required legislative changes. The department was looking at whether to broaden the scope of assaults to cover those by residents on other residents. \u201cThat decision hasn\u2019t been made,\u201d she told the hearing. The Spriggs family, who blew the whistle on abuse at Oakden, have called for a national database of abusive workers. Beauchamp told the hearing there was \u201csome merit\u201d in the concept of an employee screening database. Oakden abuse families also want CCTV cameras to be installed in communal areas of nursing homes. Beauchamp said that idea could be \u201ccontentious\u201d and would need substantial consultation. She said proposals for strict staff ratios in nursing homes were a \u201cblunt instrument\u201d but that it didn\u2019t \u201ccost anything\u201d for staff to be friendly and show empathy. Last week, the the royal commission heard up to 80% of dementia patients were taking some form of psychotropic drug but they were only useful in 10% of cases. Geriatrician Edward Strivens said the drugs put seniors at greater risk of death, stroke, disability and pneumonia. Beauchamp said the chemical restraints should only be used as a \u201clast resort\u201d. A committee was looking into medication mismanagement, she said. A month ago, on the eve of the royal commission\u2019s first hearing, the government said it would bring in new regulations on the use of chemical and physical restraints. Beauchamp confirmed no exposure draft had been released and the department was working on options to put to the aged care minister, Ken Wyatt. She maintained government funding was sufficient to meet aged care demands over the next four years. The head of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, Janet Anderson, who has been in the job for six weeks, defended the new unannounced inspection auditing regime. Anderson admitted that nursing homes could expect an inspection within 90 days of nursing home accreditation expiring. \u201cThey are probably on heightened alert \u2026 they are less well prepared than if we designated a day and a time,\u201d she said. She insisted the commission was looking to start conducting unannounced visits after hours and on weekends in coming months. The hearing was told some auditors worked part-time and also worked for providers but Anderson said the commission was across potential conflicts of interests and auditors\u2019 findings were assessed by a separate decision-maker. Asked if auditors could pick up a resident\u2019s chart and be able to tell if someone was overmedicated, Anderson said some auditors may have a nursing background but all had access to the expertise of a clinical unit. The Royal College of General Practitioners president, Harry Nespolon, told the hearing doctors seeing nursing home patients after hours was the \u201conly way it makes economic sense\u201d. \u201cIf you leave your practice during the day, you\u2019re not see patients you would normally see,\u201d he said, adding there was unpaid aspects to tending to nursing home patients such as paperwork, phone calls with hospitals and driving to the residence.",

      "bodyText": "Music festival organisers have called on the New South Wales government to halt plans for a new licensing regime. More than a dozen festival organisers and industry stakeholders, including representatives from the cancelled Psyfari and Mountain Sounds festivals, gathered at state parliament on Monday to discuss the proposed licensing scheme for music festivals, due to start on 1 March. They want the new regime delayed until after the completion of the forthcoming coronial inquest into the deaths of five people who died after taking drugs at NSW music festivals in the last six months. The music festival licensing scheme was announced following recommendations in the Keeping Them Safe report, commissioned by the government when Joseph Pham, 23, and Diana Nguyen, 21, died of suspected drug overdoses after attending the Defqon.1 music festival in September. The government has not confirmed details of the new legislation, but interim advice issued by the NSW health department and dramatic increases in costs for police and medical services led to the cancellation of Psyfari and Mountain Sounds. In a consensus statement issued after the talks, hosted by the Greens MP Cate Faehrmann and the independent MP for Sydney Alex Greenwich, the organisers called on the government to \u201cgo back to the drawing board\u201d and properly consult festival organisers before developing any new regulations. \u201cThere has been no public consultation and no genuine engagement with industry on the proposed changes,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThere is widespread confusion about the details and impact of the new regime.\u201d The statement also backs the Don\u2019t Kill Live Music petition, which has been signed by more than 105,000 people and warns music lovers that music is \u201cunder attack\u201d from the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, and the Coalition state government. The petition demands the government to convene a music roundtable to review regulation affecting live music, undertake a regulatory impact assessment on the new laws, be more transparent on costs for policing and medical services at festivals and work with the industry to keep festivals safe. Signatories to the petition include a who\u2019s who of the Australian music industry, including artists such as Amy Shark, Cloud Control, Bernard Fanning, Courtney Barnett and Dan Sultan, as well as record labels, tour operators, ticketing companies and music festivals. The organiser of Psyfari, Steve Demian, said the proposed regime \u201calmost comes across as a form of punishment for events which don\u2019t sit right with certain authorities\u201d. Speaking before Monday\u2019s meeting, Demian said the final form of the licensing scheme would make or break his festival. If smaller events are not taken into consideration \u201cthen we will simply be priced out by the added costs\u201d, he said. The Berejiklian government has staunchly refused to consider pill testing as an alternative to law enforcement, saying it gives \u201cthe green light to drugs\u201d. Experts behind a successful 2018 pill testing trial at a music festival in Canberra have offered state and territory governments across Australia a free pilot program. \u201cAny government that is truly serious about keeping their young people safe should take it up,\u201d the Pill Testing Australia spokesman and emergency doctor David Caldicott said in a statement on Monday.",

It\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary but I look real clean. I like the cut of the jeans, the nice boots, the good T-shirt; that\u2019s how I like to think of my clothes. The moment is memorable because one of my best friends, <a href=\"https://www.revolvy.com/page/Epic-Soundtracks\" title=\"\">Epic Soundtracks</a> [from the band <a href=\"https://www.allmusic.com/artist/swell-maps-mn0000756740/biography\" title=\"\">Swell Maps</a>], had just died. I was in a rough place \u2013 but I was coming out of it. Things got better: I kicked drugs and met my wife Elisabeth.</p> <p>What we wore when we were in bands in the 90s [the grunge look], it wasn\u2019t a style, it was just what we wore.

      "bodyText": "The Trump administration not only dislikes the European Union, it is out to destroy it. The trip by the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to Europe last week was episode three of the onslaught, designed to play on east-west divisions within the EU. Episode one was Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 Warsaw speech, infused with nativist nationalism. Episode two was Trump\u2019s 2018 moves on tariffs, and his tearing up of key agreements such as the Iran nuclear deal and the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. To which should be added his open encouragements to Brexiteers, and his decision to pull out of Syria. All of the above affect European (including British) interests in very concrete ways, unlike mere tweets or insults thrown at allies. Europe is trying to put up a resistance. Angela Merkel, Trump\u2019s favourite political target in the EU, received a standing ovation on Saturday at the annual Munich security conference for her speech on the virtues of multilateralism. But perhaps we have yet to fully fathom what the EU is dealing with in this new Trump era. The man now whispering into Trump\u2019s ears is John Bolton, his national security adviser. His brand of anti-EU ideology was on full display during Pompeo\u2019s tour of Budapest, Bratislava and Warsaw. Pompeo has done two significant things. First, he in effect took possession of this year\u2019s 30th-anniversary celebrations of the fall of communism in eastern Europe by waxing lyrical on US closeness to nations that fought for their freedom \u2013 all the while giving a free pass to rightwing populist governments that the EU has put on notice for their democratic backsliding. Second, through his choice of destinations, Pompeo amplified divisions between countries formerly behind the iron curtain and those that weren\u2019t. This astutely plays on sensitivities, manipulated by demagogues, that have marred the EU\u2019s capacity to unite in recent years. Some of it smacked of 2003 when, in the run-up to the Iraq invasion, the US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, coined the terms \u201cold Europe\u201d (bad) and \u201cnew Europe\u201d (good). But one big difference today is that the European project is struggling to keep afloat; back then optimists believed it would \u201crun the 21st century\u201d.

      "body": "<p>There is something surreal about these last days before Brexit \u2013 just 39 now. There is still no visibility on a deal, and no clarity on a no deal. There is no parliament that seems to have a grasp on managing the slide into the unknown, other than humiliating the prime minister in vote after vote and then proposing little as an alternative. The scene outside parliament is a collection of Brexit doomsday soothsayers and naysayers, each with chants and flags and signs and regalia. Elsewhere, stranger things are happening: pro-remain campaigners have started <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/12/naked-anti-brexit-campaigner-challenges-rees-mogg-on-live-tv\" title=\"\">stripping off</a>, we are arguing about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/14/winston-churchill-history-brexit-john-mcdonnell\" title=\"\">Winston Churchill</a> and Boer War concentration camps, and children are marching in the streets chanting: \u201cFuck Theresa May.\u201d It feels like the last days in the compound of a cult that once flourished but is now finally and fatally besieged.</p> <p>The end of such a cult, that operates outside the bounds of common sense, is inevitable. Not only that, it should be welcomed. It is time. It is time for the country to come to terms with the fact that it has for too long been in denial about some of its fundamental flaws \u2013 and if a messy unplanned Brexit is the way to do that, then so be it.</p> <p>These past few weeks are proof that Brexit, maybe even a hard Brexit, is now looking more likely. Yet, counterintuitively, it also looks like it is necessary. The country is paralysed and polarised ahead of next month\u2019s deadline in a fever of predictions, lies and anticipations that will only break when the reality bites. But already Brexit has kicked off important discussions about Britain that we were otherwise probably never going to have.</p> <p>If it appears that all we have been doing over the past two years is talking in circles about a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/15/what-is-the-brexit-backstop\" title=\"\">backstop</a>, or a meaningful vote, then think again. Brexit has revealed an unaddressed xenophobia \u2013 and the immigration system that stoked it \u2013 on the right and the left. You hear much less of Britain being a tolerant nation and a soft touch for migrants, now that the Home Office has been exposed by Brexit as it sends <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/23/home-office-apologises-for-letters-threatening-to-deport-eu-nationals\" title=\"\">threatening letters of deportation</a> to EU citizens who have lived in the country for decades. It has been an education.</p> <p>It has laid bare our political class, squirming pathetically and uselessly under the micro-scrutiny of Brexit. To paraphrase Jeff Bezos, Brexit rolled over the log and we saw what crawled out. The cavalier incompetence of David Davis, the dissimulating of Boris Johnson, the utter pointlessness of Michael Gove, the existence of Jacob Rees-Mogg and the dishonest and regressive elitism he represents. We have seen ministers entrusted with the future of the country learn on the job, and then flee the scene \u2013 revealing Westminster in general, and the Tories in particular, as a Ponzi scheme, a confidence trick. We now realise that the business of serious politics in this country rewards those whose only skill is keeping up the appearance of having a skill.</p> <p>The referendum aftermath has exposed an exceptionalism verging on delusion. It is no coincidence that Churchill\u2019s legacy has become a matter of public debate. It is an argument that reflects Britain\u2019s inner turmoil on whether it is uniquely apart from the rest of the world, or cannot thrive on its own. It is a soul-searching, long-overdue questioning of the conventional account of Britain\u2019s history. Is the country especially endowed with that historical grit and determination that helped to vanquish its enemies in two world wars and run an empire; or is it a country that ran that empire by means of brutality, and only won those wars as part of an alliance? Can we go it alone? Did we ever? Are we, as the heavily memed That Mitchell and Webb Look quote goes, the baddies?</p> <p>On this, the academic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-gilroy\" title=\"\">Paul Gilroy</a> pointed out to me that it is, ironically, Britain\u2019s global profile that has diminished its ability to focus on internal nation-building. \u201cThe British state is a machine for running and exploring the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work very well when it comes to the business of the modern nation.\u201d</p> <p>Also finally exposed is the unbridgeable gap, both economic and cultural, between centre and peripheries, between the winners and the losers. There is a double nihilism about Brexit. There are many who feel like they have nothing to lose from a no-deal scenario, while also savouring the prospect of trouble ahead. This is what happens when a country is fed a diet of crisis as glamorous film reel. You cannot fight this appetite for martyrdom with technical arguments about processing times at Dover: these perverse fantasies can only be vanquished by an actual crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/17/brexit-may-risks-fresh-confrontation-erg-backstop\">Brexit: May risks fresh confrontation with ERG over backstop</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And that is why the Brexit reckoning must happen. A humbling must come to pass. From the beginning, Brexit created its own momentum. Once the question was asked \u2013 in or out? \u2013 all the grievances, justified or not, could be projected on it, with \u201cin\u201d being widely seen as a vote for the status quo. Within this frame, nothing else matters \u2013 not economic predictions, not warnings about medicines running out, nor threats of the need to stockpile foods. The remain campaign could not have done anything differently: it lost the moment the question was asked.</p> <p>And so, maybe, in the end, we will finally believe that immigration is necessary for an economy and an NHS to function, that the inequality between the south-east and the rest of Britain is unsustainable, that our political class is over-pedigreed and under-principled. We might even believe that other crises, such as climate change, are real, too.</p> <p>Maybe, in the end, the country outside Europe will find its stride by confronting its issues rather than blaming them on others, and forging its own way. But there is only one way to find out. What a shame Brexit is that path \u2013 but better to have a path than none at all.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is something surreal about these last days before Brexit \u2013 just 39 now. There is still no visibility on a deal, and no clarity on a no deal. There is no parliament that seems to have a grasp on managing the slide into the unknown, other than humiliating the prime minister in vote after vote and then proposing little as an alternative. The scene outside parliament is a collection of Brexit doomsday soothsayers and naysayers, each with chants and flags and signs and regalia. Elsewhere, stranger things are happening: pro-remain campaigners have started stripping off, we are arguing about Winston Churchill and Boer War concentration camps, and children are marching in the streets chanting: \u201cFuck Theresa May.\u201d It feels like the last days in the compound of a cult that once flourished but is now finally and fatally besieged. The end of such a cult, that operates outside the bounds of common sense, is inevitable. Not only that, it should be welcomed. It is time. It is time for the country to come to terms with the fact that it has for too long been in denial about some of its fundamental flaws \u2013 and if a messy unplanned Brexit is the way to do that, then so be it. These past few weeks are proof that Brexit, maybe even a hard Brexit, is now looking more likely. Yet, counterintuitively, it also looks like it is necessary. The country is paralysed and polarised ahead of next month\u2019s deadline in a fever of predictions, lies and anticipations that will only break when the reality bites. But already Brexit has kicked off important discussions about Britain that we were otherwise probably never going to have. If it appears that all we have been doing over the past two years is talking in circles about a backstop, or a meaningful vote, then think again. Brexit has revealed an unaddressed xenophobia \u2013 and the immigration system that stoked it \u2013 on the right and the left. You hear much less of Britain being a tolerant nation and a soft touch for migrants, now that the Home Office has been exposed by Brexit as it sends threatening letters of deportation to EU citizens who have lived in the country for decades. It has been an education. It has laid bare our political class, squirming pathetically and uselessly under the micro-scrutiny of Brexit. To paraphrase Jeff Bezos, Brexit rolled over the log and we saw what crawled out. The cavalier incompetence of David Davis, the dissimulating of Boris Johnson, the utter pointlessness of Michael Gove, the existence of Jacob Rees-Mogg and the dishonest and regressive elitism he represents. We have seen ministers entrusted with the future of the country learn on the job, and then flee the scene \u2013 revealing Westminster in general, and the Tories in particular, as a Ponzi scheme, a confidence trick. We now realise that the business of serious politics in this country rewards those whose only skill is keeping up the appearance of having a skill. The referendum aftermath has exposed an exceptionalism verging on delusion. It is no coincidence that Churchill\u2019s legacy has become a matter of public debate. It is an argument that reflects Britain\u2019s inner turmoil on whether it is uniquely apart from the rest of the world, or cannot thrive on its own. It is a soul-searching, long-overdue questioning of the conventional account of Britain\u2019s history. Is the country especially endowed with that historical grit and determination that helped to vanquish its enemies in two world wars and run an empire; or is it a country that ran that empire by means of brutality, and only won those wars as part of an alliance? Can we go it alone? Did we ever? Are we, as the heavily memed That Mitchell and Webb Look quote goes, the baddies? On this, the academic Paul Gilroy pointed out to me that it is, ironically, Britain\u2019s global profile that has diminished its ability to focus on internal nation-building. \u201cThe British state is a machine for running and exploring the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work very well when it comes to the business of the modern nation.\u201d Also finally exposed is the unbridgeable gap, both economic and cultural, between centre and peripheries, between the winners and the losers. There is a double nihilism about Brexit. There are many who feel like they have nothing to lose from a no-deal scenario, while also savouring the prospect of trouble ahead. This is what happens when a country is fed a diet of crisis as glamorous film reel. You cannot fight this appetite for martyrdom with technical arguments about processing times at Dover: these perverse fantasies can only be vanquished by an actual crisis. And that is why the Brexit reckoning must happen. A humbling must come to pass. From the beginning, Brexit created its own momentum. Once the question was asked \u2013 in or out? \u2013 all the grievances, justified or not, could be projected on it, with \u201cin\u201d being widely seen as a vote for the status quo. Within this frame, nothing else matters \u2013 not economic predictions, not warnings about medicines running out, nor threats of the need to stockpile foods. The remain campaign could not have done anything differently: it lost the moment the question was asked. And so, maybe, in the end, we will finally believe that immigration is necessary for an economy and an NHS to function, that the inequality between the south-east and the rest of Britain is unsustainable, that our political class is over-pedigreed and under-principled. We might even believe that other crises, such as climate change, are real, too. Maybe, in the end, the country outside Europe will find its stride by confronting its issues rather than blaming them on others, and forging its own way. But there is only one way to find out. What a shame Brexit is that path \u2013 but better to have a path than none at all. \u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist",

And as for \u201cinclusion\u201d \u2013 Israel\u2019s myriad restrictions on the movement of Palestinians will ensure that almost all of them are excluded from the Eurovision festivities. Last year Israel\u2019s acclaimed theatre actor-director, Itay Tiran, was moved to urge international support for the growing Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, called for by Palestinian civil society; and tens of thousands of people across Europe, fans and musicians, have signalled that they will be campaigning to disengage their countries from the events in Tel Aviv. I understand Rice\u2019s joy at being selected as Britain\u2019s Eurovision representative. But when he believes \u201cit\u2019s not my place to say\u201d whether Israeli treatment of the Palestinians means Eurovision should be relocated, I think he\u2019s underestimating his power. He could help to ensure that Eurovision 2019 will be remembered as an occasion of principled protest, not another episode of cultural whitewashing. \u2022 Brian Eno is a musician, composer, producer and visual artist.

He also noted that Omar\u2019s brush with controversy \u201cshows she\u2019s a bit green and needs to be more sensitive with her language\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe apologized, it seems she gets it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, there\u2019s also a target on her because she\u2019s Muslim and black woman.

She has said she \u201calmost chuckle[s]\u201d when US politicians uphold Israel as a democratic example.

She pointed to the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), an influential pro-Israel lobby group that does not contribute to political campaigns but does fund educational trips to Israel for members of Congress and staff members.</p> \n<p>Following a rebuke from party leaders, Omar apologized \u201cunequivocally\u201d and said she had not intended to perpetuate Jewish stereotypes. She nonetheless stood by her argument that the \u201cproblematic role of lobbyists\u201d in US politics must be addressed.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Omar gave her first interview since the controversy, <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/rep-ilhan-omar-says-she-s-sorry-for-causing-hurt-hopes-to-rebuild-trust/505911192/\">telling her hometown newspaper</a>, the Star-Tribune of Minneapolis: \u201cI know what intolerance looks like.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cThe thing that has been hurtful about this whole process for me is knowing that I could be someone who could use language that causes hurt to others.\u201d</p> \n<p>Omar\u2019s efforts to make amends for her comments were dismissed by Republicans, who blasted press releases linking other Democrats to her in an attempt to label the whole party as antisemitic.</p> \n<p>Trump said Omar should resign while Vice-President Mike Pence said she should at a minimum be removed from the House foreign affairs committee. Those assertions invited charges of hypocrisy.</p> \n<p>In 2017, after white supremacists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia chanting, among other slogans, \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d, and after a counterprotester was killed, the president infamously declared there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d. During the 2016 election, he defended his campaign\u2019s use of image featuring Hillary Clinton\u2019s face over a six-point star and a pile of $100 bills.</p> \n<p>Critics were also quick to note that Republicans only recently punished Steve King, an Iowa representative with a long history of making overtly racist remarks.</p> \n<p>Logan Bayroff, communications director at J Street, a progressive pro-Israel group, said the fallout from Omar\u2019s comments amounted to a \u201cdangerous oversimplification and political weaponization\u201d of the issues at hand.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe congresswoman apologized for the things that she said that were problematic and insensitive,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet certainly from the rightwing and the Republican side of the aisle, there is a desire to try to exploit these controversies not to actually address questions of antisemitism and not to actually advance a better policy debate or outcomes, but to score political points.\u201d</p> \n<h2>\u2018It wasn\u2019t a question\u2019</h2> \n<p>Omar\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/13/ilhan-omar-elliott-abrams-trump-venezuela\">tense exchange with Abrams</a>, Trump\u2019s envoy to Venezuela, fell into a similar trap.

      "bodyText": "Ilhan Omar made history in January when she became the first Somali American and one of the first Muslim women sworn into the US Congress. Part of a historically diverse crop of candidates elected in the 2018 midterms, the hijab-wearing Minnesotan has become one of the faces of change in Donald Trump\u2019s America, a country she entered as a 12-year-old refugee. But in less than two months, she has also found herself at the center of controversy, reckoning with the scrutiny that accompanies the national spotlight. This week, Omar was forced to apologize for comments that Democratic leaders said contained \u201cantisemitic tropes and prejudicial accusations\u201d. Days later, her intense grilling of Elliott Abrams, a Trump official and longtime establishment figure, sparked headlines once again. Omar has emerged as a key bogeyman for Republicans, who have relentlessly attacked her views on Israeli-Palestinian relations. \u201cCongresswoman Ilhan Omar has quickly created a reputation for herself as a young, bold progressive willing to take on and challenge some of Washington DC\u2019s sacred cows, powerful interest groups and conservative godfathers like Elliot Abrams,\u201d said Wajahat Ali, a New York Times opinion writer and commentator. \u201cThis is why her diverse base elected her, why she continues to inspire progressives and it\u2019s a testament to what they expect from her \u2013 demanding accountability, oversight and calling everyone out, unapologetically.\u201d But, Ali added, \u201cshe\u2019s learning it goes both ways\u201d. He also noted that Omar\u2019s brush with controversy \u201cshows she\u2019s a bit green and needs to be more sensitive with her language\u201d. \u201cShe apologized, it seems she gets it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, there\u2019s also a target on her because she\u2019s Muslim and black woman. Let\u2019s not fool ourselves.\u201d Since her ascent to Congress, Omar\u2019s positions on Israel, one of America\u2019s closest allies, have stirred controversy for breaking with longstanding tradition in Washington. Omar has backed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanction movement, or BDS, which is designed to pressure Israel into ending the occupation of the West Bank. She has said she \u201calmost chuckle[s]\u201d when US politicians uphold Israel as a democratic example. But a recent tweet suggesting US support for Israel is motivated by political donations invited backlash from both parties. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins, baby,\u201d Omar tweeted in response to a Republican leader vowing action against her and Rashida Tlaib, another Muslim congresswoman, over their criticism of the Israeli government. The comment invoked the $100 bill, which features Benjamin Franklin, and led a Jewish journalist to ask Omar who she believed was \u201cpaying American politicians to be pro-Israel\u201d. She pointed to the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), an influential pro-Israel lobby group that does not contribute to political campaigns but does fund educational trips to Israel for members of Congress and staff members. Following a rebuke from party leaders, Omar apologized \u201cunequivocally\u201d and said she had not intended to perpetuate Jewish stereotypes. She nonetheless stood by her argument that the \u201cproblematic role of lobbyists\u201d in US politics must be addressed. On Friday, Omar gave her first interview since the controversy, telling her hometown newspaper, the Star-Tribune of Minneapolis: \u201cI know what intolerance looks like.\u201d She added: \u201cThe thing that has been hurtful about this whole process for me is knowing that I could be someone who could use language that causes hurt to others.\u201d Omar\u2019s efforts to make amends for her comments were dismissed by Republicans, who blasted press releases linking other Democrats to her in an attempt to label the whole party as antisemitic. Trump said Omar should resign while Vice-President Mike Pence said she should at a minimum be removed from the House foreign affairs committee. Those assertions invited charges of hypocrisy. In 2017, after white supremacists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia chanting, among other slogans, \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d, and after a counterprotester was killed, the president infamously declared there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d. During the 2016 election, he defended his campaign\u2019s use of image featuring Hillary Clinton\u2019s face over a six-point star and a pile of $100 bills. Critics were also quick to note that Republicans only recently punished Steve King, an Iowa representative with a long history of making overtly racist remarks. Logan Bayroff, communications director at J Street, a progressive pro-Israel group, said the fallout from Omar\u2019s comments amounted to a \u201cdangerous oversimplification and political weaponization\u201d of the issues at hand. \u201cThe congresswoman apologized for the things that she said that were problematic and insensitive,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet certainly from the rightwing and the Republican side of the aisle, there is a desire to try to exploit these controversies not to actually address questions of antisemitism and not to actually advance a better policy debate or outcomes, but to score political points.\u201d \u2018It wasn\u2019t a question\u2019 Omar\u2019s tense exchange with Abrams, Trump\u2019s envoy to Venezuela, fell into a similar trap. At a House foreign affairs committee hearing, Omar pressed Abrams over his past, including his role in the Iran-Contra scandal and support for brutal governments in Central America. \u201cMr Abrams,\u201d she said, \u201cin 1991 you pleaded guilty to two counts of withholding information from Congress regarding the Iran-Contra affair, for which you were later pardoned by President George HW Bush. I fail to understand why members of this committee or the American people should find any testimony you give today to be truthful.\u201d When Abrams attempted to respond, Omar shot back: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a question.\u201d Conservatives condemned Omar\u2019s treatment of a veteran US diplomat who has long advised prominent Republicans. Progressives celebrated Omar\u2019s questioning, which went viral as a rare example of a member of the Washington elite being taken to task. Patrick Iber, an assistant professor of history at the University of Wisconsin, said it was \u201centirely appropriate\u201d to press Abrams on his work in the Reagan years. \u201cThe Reagan administration\u2019s policies in Central America were responsible for really substantial violence and suffering and Abrams\u2019 role in that was to certify that human rights progress was being made by US-supported regimes,\u201d Iber said. \u201cThat meant, in essence, that he disqualified and discredited evidence to the contrary, including the terrible massacre at El Mozote in El Salvador.\u201d Phil Gunson, a researcher and political analyst for Crisis Group, said it would be \u201cunthinkable\u201d to not raise Abrams\u2019 past at a hearing focusing on another controversial Latin America policy issue over which he has control. \u201cIn that regard, I think Omar was absolutely right to recall that this is a public official with a record of lying to Congress,\u201d he said. Although Gunson found Omar to be \u201cill-informed\u201d on the situation in Venezuela, and how it differed from Guatemala and El Salvador in the 1980s, he said it was incumbent on lawmakers to ask tough questions of officials tasked with overseeing US policy. \u201cGiven his past record, I for one am not encouraged that the man chosen by the Trump administration to oversee the restoration of democracy in Venezuela is Elliott Abrams,\u201d Gunson said. Omar\u2019s posture has nonetheless left Democrats in Congress divided, with some voicing public concerns over the congresswoman\u2019s rhetoric and tone. But House speaker Nancy Pelosi, after meeting with Omar to address her tweets and the latter\u2019s apology, signaled it was time to move on \u2013 at least for now. \u201cA newcomer member of Congress has apologized for her remarks,\u201d Pelosi told CNN. \u201cIt took [Republicans] what, 13 years to notice Steve King?\u201d",

It is on the cover of two new books, <a href=\"https://summersdale.com/sd-book/the-joy-of-no/\" title=\"\">The Joy of No</a> (#Jono) by Debbie Chapman, published at the end of last year, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/06/the-joy-of-missing-out-svend-brinkmann-review\" title=\"\">The Joy of Missing Out</a>, by the philosopher and psychologist Svend Brinkmann, published earlier this month.

For Kondo, it is about household clutter; for Chapman and Brinkmann, it is life clutter.</p> <p>As Brinkmann writes in The Joy of Missing Out \u2013 his reversal of the Twitter phenomenon #Fomo, the fear of missing out \u2013 there is intense and growing pressure to go out more, acquire more, and just be more. This pressure comes from without and from within, from advertising and social media as well as from our own minds. \u201cWe are constantly invited to do something, think something, experience something, buy something [\u2026] when inundated by overwhelming amounts of information, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish what is important from what is not,\u201d Brinkmann writes.</p> <p>For Chapman, life clutter builds up when we fill our lives with social events we do not really want to go to, work tasks we say yes to, when they are not our responsibility, toxic relationships and unhelpful thoughts and feelings. Just as Kondo promises to bring us joy by decluttering our homes, these books promote decluttering of a different kind \u2013 social, professional, psychological, existential \u2013 that, the authors tell us, will lead us to true fulfilment and freedom.</p> <p>It is no surprise to me that this is the focus of the current wave of \u201chow can I fix my life\u201d angst. The wish to say no instead of saying yes, to stay in instead of going out, to discard instead of to accumulate \u2013 these are all logical responses to our feelings of being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/dec/26/relax-life-changing-how-to-find-comfort-zone\" title=\"\">overstretched, overtired and overwhelmed</a>. Clinical psychologist <a href=\"https://timepsychology.com/\" title=\"\">Rachel Andrew</a> says she sees this in many forms in her consulting room, with patients saying life is too stressful and too pressured, or describing themselves as detached and their lives as meaningless and unsustainable.</p> <p>Her patients tell her, she says, that \u201cthey cannot continue living at the pace they\u2019re living at\u201d, but at the same time, they cannot stop \u2013 they cannot say no. When she hears these words, Andrew begins thinking about \u201cthe core beliefs underneath people\u2019s inability to say no\u201d. When patients describe struggling to refuse to take on extra responsibilities at work, she says there is often an underlying fear that others will think they are not trying hard enough, an underlying fear that they are not good enough. That compulsive \u201cyes\u201d also forms part of a precarious solution to their self-doubt, she says, as, unconsciously: \u201cThey use this constant striving to make themselves feel better, to get that buzz from achieving things.\u201d</p> <p>When patients struggle to say no to social arrangements, she says: \u201cSometimes that can come from a core belief of feeling, deep down, that they\u2019re unlikable.\u201d The roots of these beliefs are frequently buried in our past. \u201cI often meet adults who had difficult experiences in childhood, where they felt on the outside of a social group or experienced a trauma, and they don\u2019t want to say no due to a fear of being on the outside, that people will discover them as unlikable in some way. That can lead to this perpetual need to say yes or to keep others happy.\u201d</p> <p>Maurice Mcleod, a writer and local councillor, found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/28/joy-relief-saying-no-how-learned-stop-worrying-turn-people-down\" title=\"\">his inability to say \u201cno\u201d caused him serious problems</a> when he went freelance about a decade ago.

How long will it take? How much attention will it require? This helped him to feel calmer and less panicked.

His book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/08/not-working-why-we-have-to-stop-by-josh-cohen-review\" title=\"\">Not Working: Why We Have to Stop</a>, is a critique of our state of perpetual busyness, a hymn in praise of doing nothing. But, he says, while he has added his voice to a \u201cchorus of disapproval\u201d of this culture, he has, at the same time, \u201ca certain suspicion\u201d of what is being created in its place. He says: \u201cI think that once a tendency or a counter-tendency starts to trend in this way, it becomes part of the culture it wants to critique or resist. It enters the circuit of anxiety.\u201d Inevitably, then, we begin asking ourselves, are we saying no enough? Are we missing out enough? Are we not working enough? As we strive to embrace the virtues of restraint, of doing less, of leaving space, we risk destroying that which we seek. It evaporates even as we try to articulate it, like the credibility of people who tweet about how much they are \u201cliving in the moment\u201d.</p> <p>But this is nevertheless something we need to grapple with. For Brinkmann, it is not only a question of our psychological wellbeing \u2013 although it is that too. He writes that self-restraint and missing out are as vital for the global population as they are for us as individuals because \u201cfor so long our lives have been based on overconsumption, untrammelled growth and whittling away at our natural resources\u201d. His arguments are compelling.</p> <p>Imagine that you have cancelled all your unwanted plans, said no to all your groan-inducing invitations, resisted tempting purchases, turned off your TVs, phones and computers. You are missing out on absolutely everything and feeling very smug about it, too. You are, in this moment, sitting at home, on your own, doing nothing. What happens next?</p> <p>\u201cAll of humanity\u2019s problems stem from man\u2019s inability to sit quietly in a room alone,\u201d said the 17th-century French philosopher Blaise Pascal. But the solution cannot be to force ourselves to sit quietly in a room alone, because, contrary to our own omnipotent fantasies and risible delusions of self-control, we cannot choose what we feel or what we think. We have to ask, why is this such an impossible thing for us to do? Why do we persist in filling our lives, even when we do not want to? What is it that we are avoiding? Ultimately, why do we continue to do the very things that make us unhappy?</p> <p>Such big questions can be addressed by <a href=\"https://psychoanalysis.org.uk/iopa-clinics/low-fee-scheme\" title=\"\">psychoanalysis</a>, says Cohen, since, \u201cuniquely to itself, it encourages us to ask questions about how we live that we are allowed to sit with, and turn over, and not feel under pressure to resolve. It asks us to be with the question rather than leap to the answer.\u201d He also suggests taking a long walk with no destination in mind, or meeting a friend without a time limit or agenda \u2013 in other words, trying to create an expanse in your life that is not hemmed in by time, space, or purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s all about cultivating in oneself the impulse to aimlessness,\u201d he says.</p> <p>As for #Jono and #Jomo \u2013 well, for me, saying no and missing out are not where I find my joy. I find it when I am not looking for it: when I am making my friend\u2019s children laugh, or when I feel a spontaneous surge of love for my husband, or when I am cooking dinner for my friends. Cohen says: \u201cIf you read the great poets of joy, like Rilke, they think of joy as something fleeting. There is something sad about it, because one feels its passing as one experiences it \u2013 it is not some kind of permanent aspiration, a solid state.\u201d It is a word that loses all meaning when it is part of a hashtagged acronym.</p> <p>In these dysfunctional times, joy is a high bar. Perhaps we could start with trying to be honest with ourselves.</p>",

But this is nevertheless something we need to grapple with. For Brinkmann, it is not only a question of our psychological wellbeing \u2013 although it is that too. He writes that self-restraint and missing out are as vital for the global population as they are for us as individuals because \u201cfor so long our lives have been based on overconsumption, untrammelled growth and whittling away at our natural resources\u201d. His arguments are compelling. Imagine that you have cancelled all your unwanted plans, said no to all your groan-inducing invitations, resisted tempting purchases, turned off your TVs, phones and computers. You are missing out on absolutely everything and feeling very smug about it, too. You are, in this moment, sitting at home, on your own, doing nothing. What happens next? \u201cAll of humanity\u2019s problems stem from man\u2019s inability to sit quietly in a room alone,\u201d said the 17th-century French philosopher Blaise Pascal. But the solution cannot be to force ourselves to sit quietly in a room alone, because, contrary to our own omnipotent fantasies and risible delusions of self-control, we cannot choose what we feel or what we think. We have to ask, why is this such an impossible thing for us to do? Why do we persist in filling our lives, even when we do not want to? What is it that we are avoiding? Ultimately, why do we continue to do the very things that make us unhappy? Such big questions can be addressed by psychoanalysis, says Cohen, since, \u201cuniquely to itself, it encourages us to ask questions about how we live that we are allowed to sit with, and turn over, and not feel under pressure to resolve. It asks us to be with the question rather than leap to the answer.\u201d He also suggests taking a long walk with no destination in mind, or meeting a friend without a time limit or agenda \u2013 in other words, trying to create an expanse in your life that is not hemmed in by time, space, or purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s all about cultivating in oneself the impulse to aimlessness,\u201d he says. As for #Jono and #Jomo \u2013 well, for me, saying no and missing out are not where I find my joy. I find it when I am not looking for it: when I am making my friend\u2019s children laugh, or when I feel a spontaneous surge of love for my husband, or when I am cooking dinner for my friends. Cohen says: \u201cIf you read the great poets of joy, like Rilke, they think of joy as something fleeting. There is something sad about it, because one feels its passing as one experiences it \u2013 it is not some kind of permanent aspiration, a solid state.\u201d It is a word that loses all meaning when it is part of a hashtagged acronym. In these dysfunctional times, joy is a high bar. Perhaps we could start with trying to be honest with ourselves.",

The free-to-air TV industry has also asked for tax breaks for Australian news producers \u2013 a \u201cnews production tax offset\u201d \u2013 and a new regime to ensure Facebook and Google are accountable for paying local content producers a fair rate of advertising revenue. In December the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission floated the possibility of a new body which would have the power to require information on how Facebook and Google\u2019s algorithms work, a so-called algorithm regulator. The algorithm regulator would allow the watchdog to see how Google and Facebook\u2019s machine-driven formulas rank content and determine what users will see first. Free TV wants more transparency around how Google in particular ranks content and pays advertising revenue to Australian media companies. But Facebook has rejected any such control over its platform, saying the ACCC recommendation is a \u201cstriking\u201d intervention which is not supported by evidence. \u201cThe ACCC has not made a case or provided any evidence for why they believe an algorithm regulator is a necessary, effective and proportionate response to the business model challenges facing news media,\u201d Facebook\u2019s vice president of Australian policy, Simon Milner, said in a blog post on Monday. \u201cInstead it has floated a number of possible tax incentives for media companies who conduct certain types of public interest journalism. \u201cMore importantly, people, not regulators, should decide what they see in their news feeds.\u201d When the ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, released the commission\u2019s preliminary report in December, he said journalism was a public good and the powerful digital platforms had transformed the way consumers accessed news.

Jacinda Ardern opened her weekly media briefing with a statement on China, using it to explain the context of the relationship \u201cand also to correct some of the inaccuracies that I have heard\u201d. Last year New Zealand temporarily banned Chinese telco Huawei from participating in the country\u2019s nationwide 5G rollout, citing security concerns. Since then a slew of smaller tensions have arisen between the two countries, prompting opposition leader Simon Bridges to claim Ardern was overseeing \u201csteadily deteriorating relations\u201d with the country\u2019s largest trading partner. Ardern on Monday devoted six minutes of her news conference to the \u201crobust and mature relationship\u201d between China and New Zealand, flagging co-operation on climate change, NZ$28bn (\u00a315bn) of trade and \u201cstrong science, research \u2026 and cultural, people-to-people connections\u201d as evidence that ties remained intact. Ardern debunked a recent domestic news story that claimed five government MPs were having their visas held up as \u201ccompletely incorrect\u201d, saying no government ministers were waiting on visas or letters of invitation from China. Other news reports suggesting New Zealand exports were being held up at the Chinese border \u201cdon\u2019t reflect the facts on the ground\u201d, Ardern said. Ardern went on to say that reports Beijing was warning Chinese visitors away from New Zealand were wrong, and the facts showed Chinese visitors to New Zealand increased 7.3% in 2018, and their spending dollars were up 14%. \u201cNew Zealand and China have differences of views on some issues, as we do with any other country,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cHowever this is a robust and mature relationship, we manage these differences together in a mutually respectful way.\u201d The prime minister also made a nod to the plight of China scholar Anne-Marie Brady, who says she has been the victim of a state-orchestrated harassment campaign by China and accused New Zealand\u2019s government of not doing enough to protect her and her family. \u201cThis is a government which will apply the rule of law scrupulously, and even more so in addressing matters that affect the security and wellbeing of New Zealanders,\u201d Ardern said. Ardern\u2019s strong address come after months of escalating tensions between New Zealand and China, including the cancellation of a joint tourism agreement, a postponed visit by Ardern to Beijing, an advertising blitz by Huawei which ran in the country\u2019s largest newspapers, and the Pacific \u201creset\u201d \u2013 New Zealand\u2019s strengthening of ties in the Pacific region to counter growing Chinese influence. China experts say the relationship between the two countries is \u201cbumpier\u201d than it has been in a long time, but no more so than China\u2019s relations with other western democracies such as the US, UK and Australia.",

Although Francis, who will be present throughout the summit and will give a closing speech, has previously warned that expectations must be \u201cdeflated\u201d, the senior Vatican figure moderating the conference said last week that the church\u2019s credibility was \u201cstrongly at stake\u201d. Father Federico Lombardi said in Rome: \u201cWe must deal with this theme with depth and without fear.\u201d Conceding there had been \u201cresistance\u201d by some bishops, he added: \u201cIf we don\u2019t commit ourselves to fight against these crimes, in society and in the church, then we are not fulfilling our duty.\u201d Massimo Faggioli, a church historian and professor of theology, has said: \u201cIn my opinion, [this is] the most serious crisis in the Catholic church since the Protestant Reformation.\u201d The issue, he added, was being used to \u201cradically delegitimise\u201d Francis\u2019s papacy. The presidents of 115 bishops\u2019 conferences from around the world have been invited to Rome, along with a dozen heads of eastern Orthodox churches and 10 representatives of women\u2019s religious orders. Bishops were urged to meet with survivors of sexual abuse in their countries ahead of the conference. Survivors will give testimonies at daily prayer services during the Rome meeting, and vigils and marches organised by advocacy groups are expected to take place outside. The protection of minors in the church summit comes after a year in which the church was shaken by multiple scandals of sexual abuse and its cover-up by senior members of the church in North and South America, Europe and Australia. The pope was accused of failing to grasp the seriousness and scale of the problem, and of disregarding widespread rumours of sexual abuse concerning McCarrick. Francis\u2019s conservative enemies seized on the issue to attack his papacy. But in December, the pope vowed the church would never again cover up sexual abuse, and would spare no effort to bring perpetrators of such \u201cabominations\u201d to justice. He warned abusers to \u201chand yourself over to human justice, and prepare for divine justice\u201d. This month, he acknowledged for the first time the sexual abuse of nuns by priests and bishops, saying some had been reduced to \u201csexual slavery\u201d. In one case, an Indian bishop has been accused of repeatedly raping a nun over a two-year period. The abuse scandals that have emerged over the past 20 years have been concentrated in western countries. Very little is known about the scale of abuse in the global south, where the Catholic church has undergone huge growth. \u201cMany bishops in the global south do not believe that sex abuse of minors is a problem in their countries. They see it as a first world problem,\u201d Thomas Reese, a Jesuit priest and commentator on the church, wrote last month. \u201cThis is in part because many global south bishops have no idea how bad the problem is.

Despite efforts to play down expectations of the conference, some survivors and church figures hope Francis will explicitly lay down the law to bishops \u2013 although they enjoy significant autonomy in their dioceses. Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago, a member of the committee preparing the meeting, said he was confident \u201cwe can expect decisive action to follow from the meeting \u2026 both in Rome and in dioceses worldwide\u201d. The summit would \u201cadvance a framework of protocols for responding to allegations of clergy sexual abuse\u201d, including identifying \u201cconcrete steps required to implement practices that safeguard children and to bring justice to victims in a way that is responsible, accountable and transparent \u2013 even in cultures where law enforcement or the government may not be reliable partners,\u201d he told America magazine. Francis had \u201cacknowledged and apologised for his mistakes, itself an important action, and a model for all bishops\u201d and had made it clear that a bishop \u201ccan be legitimately removed from office if he has through negligence committed or through omission facilitated acts that have caused grave harm to others\u201d, Cupich said. He added: \u201cThe very fact that the pope has called this meeting indicates his resolve to make sure there is no doubt about what to do in such matters.\u201d Although Francis had come in for criticism over his handling of the sexual abuse issue, \u201cit is not a question of what is at stake for the pontificate of Pope Francis, but what is at stake for the church,\u201d Cupich said.",

Daley said in the announcement that the timing, size and content of each auction round would be determined in conjunction with the Australian Energy Market Operator.

In December, Harwin said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d with the outcome of the Council of Australian Governments energy council, saying an obligation to reduce emissions was \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d to encourage investment in new power generation and lower prices. The NSW Labor announcement comes after Daley last week said the party would aim to see half a million more homes in the state install rooftop solar over the next decade by allowing owner-occupied households in NSW with a combined income of $180,000 or less to claim a capped solar rebate.",

      "bodyText": "A former FBI acting director has alleged Donald Trump dismissed advice from his own security agencies on the threat posed by North Korea\u2019s missiles, saying \u201cI don\u2019t care. I believe Putin.\u201d Andrew McCabe made the claims in an interview with 60 Minutes, in which he discussed his tenure at the FBI after James Comey was fired by the president in 2017. McCabe said Trump made the comments in a meeting about the weapons capability of North Korea. McCabe was not in the meeting with Trump and said his FBI colleague told him about it later. \u201cThe president launched into several unrelated diatribes. One of those was commenting on the recent missile launches by the government of North Korea. And, essentially, the president said he did not believe that the North Koreans had the capability to hit us here with ballistic missiles in the United States. And he did not believe that because President Putin had told him they did not. President Putin had told him that the North Koreans don\u2019t actually have those missiles,\u201d said McCabe. \u201cIntelligence officials in the briefing responded that that was not consistent with any of the intelligence our government possesses,\u201d said McCabe in the interview. \u201cTo which the president replied, \u2018I don\u2019t care. I believe Putin.\u2019\u201d McCabe said he was shocked when he found about the president\u2019s alleged comments. \u201cIt\u2019s just an astounding thing to say,\u201d said McCabe, who added he was surprised at the dismissal of the work of his intelligence community. \u201cTo be confronted with an absolute disbelief in those efforts and an unwillingness to learn the true state of affairs that he has to deal with every day was just shocking,\u201d said McCabe. McCabe also alleged a \u201ccrime may have been committed\u201d when Trump fired the head of the FBI and tried to publicly undermine an investigation into his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. Trump responded furiously on Twitter after parts of the episode were trailed late last week. \u201cDisgraced FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe pretends to be a \u201cpoor little Angel\u201d when in fact he was a big part of the Crooked Hillary Scandal &amp; the Russia Hoax - a puppet for Leakin\u2019 James Comey. I.G. report on McCabe was devastating,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cMcCabe is a disgrace to the FBI and a disgrace to our Country. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d Trump retweeted the tweets on Sunday night after the 60 Minutes episode was aired. McCabe also told 60 Minutes the FBI had good reason to open a counter-intelligence investigation into whether Trump was in league with Russia, and therefore a possible national security threat, following Comey\u2019s dismissal in May 2017. \u201cAnd the idea is, if the president committed obstruction of justice, fired the director of the of the FBI to negatively impact or to shut down our investigation of Russia\u2019s malign activity and possibly in support of his campaign, as a counterintelligence investigator you have to ask yourself, \u2018Why would a president of the United States do that?\u2019\u201d McCabe said. He added: \u201cSo all those same sorts of facts cause us to wonder is there an inappropriate relationship, a connection between this president and our most fearsome enemy, the government of Russia?\u201d Asked whether deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein was onboard with the obstruction and counterintelligence investigations, McCabe replied: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment Sunday night. McCabe also said that when Trump told Rosenstein to put in writing his concerns about Comey \u2013 a document the White House initially held up as justification for his firing \u2013 the president explicitly asked him to refer to Russia. Rosenstein did not want to, McCabe said, and the memo that was made public upon Comey\u2019s dismissal did not mention Russia and focused instead on Comey\u2019s handling of the Hillary Clinton email server investigation. Those actions, including a separate request by Trump that the FBI end an investigation into his first national adviser, Michael Flynn, made the FBI concerned the president was illegally trying to obstruct the Russia investigation. \u201cPut together, these circumstances were articulable facts that indicated that a crime may have been committed,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cThe president may have been engaged in obstruction of justice in the firing of Jim Comey.\u201d McCabe was fired in March 2018 by Jeff Sessions after McCabe released information to the media without authorisation, saying he had \u201clacked candour\u201d when discussing it.

      "bodyText": "The Tesla big battery at Hornsdale in South Australia continues to make its mark on the Australian energy market, pocketing another $4m in the fourth quarter from the provision of frequency and ancillary services. The number was revealed in the Australian Energy Market Operator\u2019s latest Quarterly Dynamics report, which also reveals a growing focus on energy storage, and time shifting and energy arbitrage in particular. The fourth quarter was notable because it saw the number of big batteries on the main grid multiply, with the addition of the Dalrymple North battery in South Australia, and the Gannawarra and Ballarat big batteries in Victoria. It also saw a record amount of pumped hydro used since 2008, a sure sign of the greater role for energy storage that is to come as the share of wind and solar continues to soar and more battery and pumped hydro systems, along with other forms of storage such as hydrogen and solar thermal, come into the system. The performance and business model of the Tesla big battery has been a source of fascination for the industry since its opening more than 14 months ago. Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk recently confirmed that the $95m facility was likely to pay itself back within a few years. The battery, actually owned and operated by Neoen Australia, receives a $4m a year payment for providing grid services to the South Australia government \u2013 a payment worth significantly more given its recent performance keeping the lights on in the state after a lightning strike in northern NSW led to load shedding and generator trips in all other states. Tesla has also made money out of the FCAS (Frequency Control Ancillary Services) market, and lowered costs at the same time. Its presence has effectively destroyed a \u201ccartel\u201d- like play that pushed prices into the stratosphere, and allowed Aemo to remove constraints that were exploited by the gas generators. The latest data from Aemo is of particular interest. It shows that the Tesla big battery\u2019s revenues from FCAS continued apace, and it gained $4.5m (net) from FCAS contingency and regulation markets ($4.9m revenue minus $0.4m in costs). (A small amount of that might have been attributable to other batteries). Demand response, through specialist aggregator EnerNoc, also captured a $3.5m share of those two markets. Between them, batteries and demand response had captured 27% of that market. But it also reveals growing opportunities in energy storage and time shifting, likely to be the key metric for most of the batteries that follow, given the opportunities within the FCAS market are limited. Aemo noted that there are now significantly higher spreads between peak and off-peak prices in the wholesale market, and the difference had nearly doubled to $47/MWh from $25/MWh in Queensland and NSW over the last year. But here\u2019s the problem. The \u201cround trip efficiency\u201d means that the \u201cpark spreads\u201d, the profits made by the various storage facilities, are still low for energy arbitrage. In fact, for pumped hydro, the \u201cpark spread\u201d was zero, meaning that after losses from the pumping process, it made no money. Batteries (mostly Hornsdale but in the latter weeks of the quarter also the other facilities) made a \u201cpark spread\u201d of $20/MWh \u2013 but that was mostly courtesy of their participation in the FCAS markets. Interestingly, the \u201cpark spread\u201d for battery storage was significantly higher in previous quarters (around $36/MWh), but Aemo says it was diluted in the fourth quarter by the arrival of the new facilities, which did not compete much in FCAS. Still, the graph above shows that batteries such as Hornsdale appeared to make more out of energy arbitrage \u2013 perhaps due to their speed of response \u2013 than the pumped hydro facilities. And, of course, most of their money came from contingency and regulation FCAS. It goes to highlight that until new rules are introduced and come into effect that can recognise and unlock the multiple potential value streams for battery storage, the facilities may struggle to find a suitable business model. That will be of keen interest to the promoters and builders of new batteries, such as those going in at the Lake Bonney and Lincoln Gap windfarms in South Australia, proposed by Sanjeev Gupta for Whyalla, and AGL in Queensland, and numerous other projects promising big things in storage. \u2022 Giles Parkinson is the editor of RenewEconomy, where this article was originally published",

      "bodyText": "The government ministers Michaelia Cash and Michael Keenan twice declined to be interviewed by federal police about the leaking of the dramatic 2017 raids on the Australian Workers Union\u2019s offices. Australian federal police officials also told a Senate estimates committee on Monday morning they formed the view while investigating the leaks that evidence \u201cmay have been destroyed\u201d. The statements from police came as Cash\u2019s former chief of staff Ben Davies told a court on Monday he had learned of the raids from the union regulator\u2019s then media adviser Mark Lee while the pair made arrangements for Lee\u2019s new job in Cash\u2019s office. The AWU is seeking to quash the Registered Organisations Commission\u2019s (Roc) investigation into donations made to GetUp while Bill Shorten was its leader. The union cites referrals from Cash and her staff leaking news of the raids as proof the probe was politically motivated. The estimates hearing was told on Monday Cash and Keenan had provided police with written material, which was not classified as a witness statement. Eight people they approached declined to give witness statements, and some of the eight were currently testifying in court proceedings. Police twice unsuccessfully asked Keenan and Cash to speak with police. \u201cWe wanted to have the opportunity to speak to them both,\u201d the AFP deputy commissioner, Leanne Close, told the hearing. Cash said during the civil trial on Friday police had asked her if she wanted to \u201cprovide a voluntary witness statement\u201d. She sent police a copy of her comments at Senate estimates from the Hansard. When asked if she had informed police whether her former media adviser, David De Garis, had leaked news of the raids to the media, she told the court: \u201cThey did not ask.\u201d She said she referred police to the Hansard and \u201cthey had no further questions\u201d. The AFP commissioner, Andrew Colvin, told the estimates hearing police collected a brief of evidence against one person, but prosecutors decided the evidence was insufficient to press charges. Senior police were pushed by the Labor senator Murray Watt on whether the destruction of evidence could amount to perverting the course of justice. In court hearings last week De Garis said he had deleted three text messages he exchanged with a colleague in Michael Keenan\u2019s office about the raids before handing in his phone. Asked whether police might reopen the investigation in the light of evidence given in the court proceedings, Colvin said it \u201calways remains a possibility\u201d to reopen investigations, but he declined to say whether the Cash investigation would be one of them. De Garis and Davies were granted a certificate in court last week that means the evidence they provided in court could not be used against them. Davies told the court on Monday that Lee called him and \u201cvolunteered\u201d an \u201cunsourced tip-off\u201d about the raids before the 24 October raids. \u201c[The information was] unsolicited, unprompted and unexpected,\u201d he said. The pair had been organising the arrangements for Lee to start in Cash\u2019s office as a new media adviser. The court heard last week that Davies went on to pass the information to De Garis, who then worked together with one of Keenan\u2019s media advisers to tip off news outlets. Cash said in court last week she first learned about the raids when she watched them unfold on television. Davies took the call in the minister\u2019s office but told the court he did not think to tell her that operational information was being inappropriately disseminated because she was in \u201cback-to-back\u201d meetings. \u201cThe information at the time was an unsourced tip-off whose veracity had not yet been confirmed,\u201d he said. Lee did not \u201cindicate his source of the information\u201d, Davies told the court. Davies said he \u201cauthorised\u201d De Garis to tell the media about the raids on a \u201cconfidential, background basis\u201d. He also acknowledged there were \u201cobvious political implications\u201d to what Lee had told him \u2013 that the donations were made when \u201cMr Shorten was involved with the Australian Workers\u2019 Union\u201d. Lee and the senior Roc offical Chris Enright will also give evidence in court at a later date.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s major political parties have been targeted by a \u201csophisticated state actor\u201d, according to Scott Morrison, as part of a breach of the Parliament House computer network. The head of the Australian Cyber Security Centre, Alastair MacGibbon, says agencies were unsure what material had been taken in the incident because the rapid remediation efforts had removed some of the forensic evidence. The prime minister confirmed the state-sponsored intrusion in a statement to parliament on Monday, but said there was no evidence of electoral interference and measures had been put in place to \u201censure the integrity of our electoral system\u201d. Morrison said he had instructed the Australian Cyber Security Centre \u201cto be ready to provide any political party or electoral body in Australia with immediate support, including making their technical experts available\u201d. He said the federal and state electoral commissions and cybersecurity agencies in the states had been briefed and the cybersecurity centre in Canberra had also worked with global anti-virus companies \u201cso the world can detect this malicious activity\u201d. MacGibbon told reporters he was not able to answer whether data had been taken because agencies were \u201cacting extraordinarily quickly and very openly, so we are piecing together all of the events\u201d. \u201cThese are very early days, and the decision was made, the right decision was made, to go public and to take overt actions to secure these systems in order to risk manage the exercise,\u201d he said. Responding to the statement, the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, told parliament that government institutions, such as electoral commissions, were generally well protected, \u201cbut our party political structures perhaps are more vulnerable\u201d. He noted that in comparable attacks overseas \u201cit is progressive parties that are more likely to be targeted by ultra-rightwing organisations\u201d. Shorten said political parties were small organisations with only a few full-time staff, but they were in the business of collecting, storing and using \u201clarge amounts of information about voters and communities\u201d. \u201cThese institutions can be a soft target and our national approach to cybersecurity needs to pay more attention to non-government organisations,\u201d he said. \u201cOur agencies shouldn\u2019t just be providing advice to political parties, but actively assisting in their defence.\u201d Morrison said the intrusion into the networks of political parties had been detected by agencies investigating the attack on the Parliament House network. He said security agencies had \u201cacted decisively\u201d to confront the incursion and were \u201csecuring these systems and protecting users\u201d. The prime minister did not say which country was behind the intrusion and told parliament he did not intend to go into detail about operational matters. Morrison told parliament Australia\u2019s democratic process \u201cis our greatest asset\u201d and \u201cour most critical piece of national infrastructure\u201d. \u201cPublic confidence in the integrity of our democratic processes is an essential element of Australian sovereignty and governance,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile we will vigorously argue over many issues, we are all united in our commitment to democratic principles.\u201d Shorten said Labor had confidence and \u201ctrust\u201d in Australia\u2019s security agencies, but he said perhaps the organisational structures needed adjusting given the scale of the threats. \u201cI would say that I have great trust in our security agencies and their professionalism to do all that they can to protect our nation against cyber threats, but we constantly need to be asking ourselves if our settings are right,\u201d he said.

Most independent LGBT activists on the island have relied mainly on social media posts.</p> <p>The Cuban government backed away from enshrining gay marriage in the new constitution after widespread popular rejection. In the public consultations about the new constitution organised in neighbourhoods, workplaces, and universities last year, Cubans made 192,408 comments on Article 68 \u2013 which defined marriage as \u201cthe voluntary union between two people\u201d rather than a union \u201cbetween man and woman\u201d as in the current constitution. A strong majority requested that Article 68 be eliminated.</p> <p>Cuba\u2019s National Assembly announced on Twitter in December that it had eliminated the language \u201cas a way of respecting all opinions\u201d. The final constitution to be voted on by the population waters down the initial wording while leaving the door open to the legalisation of gay marriage in the future.</p> <p>Analysts expect the yes vote to win comfortably and turnout to be high. But a significant no vote would reflect a political opening on the island coupled with a new generation of leadership that has not yet cemented its authority.</p> <p>It would also underline how, as elsewhere in Latin America, evangelical Christians have become a political force. Pastors claim that 10% of Cuba\u2019s population of 11 million are now evangelical. The vast majority of them the Guardian has spoken to in recent weeks have said they will vote no on Sunday.</p> <p>According to electoral authorities, 98% of the Cuban electorate turned out to vote on Cuba\u2019s current constitution in 1976. But in recent years turnout has fallen. While strongly encouraged, voting in Cuba is optional and ballots are secret. Cuba does not allow international observers to audit elections.</p>",

That\u2019s what happens in other countries once gay marriage is legalised.\u201d While the state is using television, newspapers and public billboards to urge the population to vote yes to the new constitution, evangelical denominations have run a bullish and unprecedented counter-campaign. Methodist, Pentecostal, Baptist and Assembly of God denominations have hung three-metre banners on their churches reading: \u201cI\u2019m in favour of the original design. Marriage: man + woman.\u201d Churches have printed hundreds of thousands of posters and flyers which the faithful have stuck on doors, lamp posts and inside buses. The church delivered a petition with 178,000 signatures against the legal recognition of gay marriage to Cuba\u2019s National Assembly in October last year \u2013 an event without historical parallel on the island. The church\u2019s highly organised operation has overwhelmed the campaign in support of gay marriage run by the state-linked National Centre for Sex Education (Cenesex) and the island\u2019s LGBT community. Most independent LGBT activists on the island have relied mainly on social media posts. The Cuban government backed away from enshrining gay marriage in the new constitution after widespread popular rejection. In the public consultations about the new constitution organised in neighbourhoods, workplaces, and universities last year, Cubans made 192,408 comments on Article 68 \u2013 which defined marriage as \u201cthe voluntary union between two people\u201d rather than a union \u201cbetween man and woman\u201d as in the current constitution. A strong majority requested that Article 68 be eliminated. Cuba\u2019s National Assembly announced on Twitter in December that it had eliminated the language \u201cas a way of respecting all opinions\u201d. The final constitution to be voted on by the population waters down the initial wording while leaving the door open to the legalisation of gay marriage in the future. Analysts expect the yes vote to win comfortably and turnout to be high. But a significant no vote would reflect a political opening on the island coupled with a new generation of leadership that has not yet cemented its authority. It would also underline how, as elsewhere in Latin America, evangelical Christians have become a political force. Pastors claim that 10% of Cuba\u2019s population of 11 million are now evangelical. The vast majority of them the Guardian has spoken to in recent weeks have said they will vote no on Sunday. According to electoral authorities, 98% of the Cuban electorate turned out to vote on Cuba\u2019s current constitution in 1976. But in recent years turnout has fallen. While strongly encouraged, voting in Cuba is optional and ballots are secret. Cuba does not allow international observers to audit elections.",

      "bodyText": "The Australian federal police has blamed the Department of Home Affairs for the circumstances which led to the arrest and detention of Hakeem al-Araibi in Thailand. Under questioning at Senate estimates in Canberra on Monday, it was revealed home affairs took almost three weeks from when it first received Al-Araibi\u2019s red notice to when it told the AFP he was a refugee, by which time he was already in a Thai cell. Al-Araibi was arrested on 27 November last year when he arrived in Bangkok with his wife for their honeymoon. Thai authorities presented an Interpol red notice, issued at Bahrain\u2019s request, as the basis for his arrest. It would eventually be revealed that Bahrain was granted the red notice against Interpol\u2019s policies which protect refugees from the country they fled. In his opening statement the AFP commissioner, Andrew Colvin sought to address much of the criticism that had been directed at his organisation\u2019s role in Al-Araibi\u2019s ordeal. The AFP acts as Interpol\u2019s Australian national central bureau (NCB). The red notice had been issued \u201cin good faith by Interpol\u201d but if they had all the \u201crelevant facts\u201d, including that Al-Araibi was a refugee, they would not have issued it, Colvin said. Colvin told estimates neither the AFP or NCB can access visa information and they relied on the department to tell them if a red notice subject was a refugee. In Al-Araibi\u2019s case that took almost three weeks and did not occur until after Al-Araibi was arrested. \u201cOn 8 November 2018 at the request of Bahrain, Interpol issued a red notice for Mr Al-Araibi, which the AFP conveyed to the Australian border force on the 9 November,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither the AFP nor the Australian NCB was aware of his refugee visa status. This was not known until after his detention in Thailand.\u201d \u201cThe home affairs department provided Mr Al-Araibi\u2019s visa status to the AFP on 28 November, the day after his arrest in Thailand.\u201d The red notice was turned around within 24 hours. The deputy AFP commissioner, Ramzi Jabbour, said that under Australian processes, the Australian NCB notifies home affairs of a new alert and if the department finds a match in their protection visa records it informs the AFP. The NCB then asks for permission to inform Interpol and have the red notice cancelled, which was what happened in this case, said Jabbour. \u201cBut not until after he was arrested,\u201d replied Greens senator Nick McKim. \u201cRegrettably that is correct,\u201d said Jabbour. Estimates also heard that on 27 November \u2013 the day Al-Araibi left Melbourne \u2013 ABF \u201crequested advice [from the AFP] about whether there was any lawful authority that prevented the travel, given that Mr Al-Araibi was subject to a red notice\u201d. This was standard procedure, Jabbour said, adding that the ABF asked if he could be detained on the basis of the red notice. Colvin said a red notice was not treated as a warrant to arrest in Australia, but \u201cin border force\u2019s mind\u201d they wondered if there was a way to prohibit him leaving. \u201cThe answer was no.\u201d Colvin said he was confident the Australian NCB had adhered to the policies and procedures of Interpol, and told the hearing the home affairs portfolio was reviewing the chronology of events in an attempt to improve information exchange procedures. Head of home affairs, Michael Pezzullo, defended his department and said there were \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of alerts in a system that was largely manual. Pezzullo said the commissioner of the ABF, Michael Outram, would answer more specific questions later on Monday, but noted the AFP and ABF were independent organisations despite both being under the home affairs umbrella.",

Shamima Begum, 19, who left the UK with two school friends in 2015, spoke to the Times while heavily pregnant earlier this week from the al-Hawl refugee camp in north-eastern Syria. She said she was desperate to come back to the UK. Her family\u2019s lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, said Begum had given birth on Saturday and that, though they had not had direct contact with her, they understood that both she and the baby were in good health. Speaking to Sky News on Sunday while sitting with her newborn, she said: \u201cI feel a lot of people should have sympathy for me, for everything I\u2019ve been through. You know, I didn\u2019t know what I was getting into when I left. \u201cI was hoping that maybe for the sake of me and my child they let me come back. Because I can\u2019t live in this camp forever. It\u2019s not really possible.\u201d Akunjee said news of the birth had changed the dynamics of the situation and increased pressure on the government to let Begum, and now her child, back. \u201cWe are now dealing with an innocent baby who we would like to get out of the camp and back to the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would like every effort made by the British government to get the baby back despite the words of the home secretary, which have been shown to be wrong by the justice secretary and the head of MI6 and experts in international law.\u201d Asked to respond to concerns that she could be potentially dangerous if she returned, Begum said: \u201cThey don\u2019t have any evidence against me doing anything dangerous. When I went to Syria I was just a housewife, the entire four years I stayed at home, took care of my husband, took care of my kids. I never did anything. I never made propaganda, I never encouraged people to come to Syria.\u201d Begum said she had not met any British consulate officials, only journalists. Asked what she thought life may be like for her back in the UK, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, because I know there would be a lot of restrictions on me \u2026 I don\u2019t know if they will take my child away.\u201d Begum married Yago Riedijk, 27, a Dutch convert to Islam, 10 days after arriving in the city of Raqqa in 2015. She had two children, both of whom died. She told the Times she wanted to return home to protect the health of her new baby. It emerged on Sunday that Begum has named the child Jarah after one of the two children she has lost since November 2018. Begum\u2019s family have called on the British government to allow her to return to the UK so her child can be cared for in \u201cpeace and security\u201d. But the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said he would not hesitate to block her return. \u201cMy message is clear: if you have supported terrorist organisations abroad I will not hesitate to prevent your return,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you do manage to return you should be ready to be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted.\u201d Writing in the Sunday Times, Javid said: \u201cAs a father I feel compassion for anyone born or brought into a conflict zone. But in considering what actions need to be taken now, I have to think about the safety and security of children living in our country.\u201d In a statement issued on Friday, the family said her apparent lack of regret for joining Isis should be seen as the \u201cwords of a girl who was groomed at the age of 15\u201d. \u201cNow we are faced with the situation of knowing that Shamima\u2019s young children have died \u2013 children we will never come to know as a family. This is the hardest of news to bear,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe welfare of Shamima\u2019s unborn child is of paramount concern to our family, and we will do everything within our power to protect that baby who is entirely blameless in these events.\u201d Helen Clark, a former head of the United Nations Development Programme and prime minister of New Zealand, said Begum had been groomed and had the right to return to the UK. \u201cShe is a UK citizen, she\u2019s born there. The head of MI6 says she has a right to return,\u201d she told Newstalk ZB in New Zealand on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s always possible that people can turn their lives around. We\u2019ve seen that before.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m appalled by the \u2018no regret\u2019 attitude she showed,\u201d she added. \u201cBut nonetheless she is a citizen, and in the end we do have obligations to citizens.\u201d Speaking on the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, said the nationality of Begum\u2019s child was \u201cnot straightforward\u201d. He said there were concerns about her health and the health of her baby, but that, if she did return to the UK she would have to \u201canswer for her actions\u201d. \u201cBritish citizens who only have British citizenship are entitled to come back to the UK. That\u2019s a matter of international law. But as a matter of international law too, and domestic law potentially, people also have to take responsibility for their actions, and she will be no exception to that.\u201d Shamima Begum, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase followed their school friend Sharmeena Begum in travelling to Syria to join Isis in the half-term break of February 2015. The three pupils at Bethnal Green academy, aged between 15 and 16 at the time, took a Turkish Airlines flight from Gatwick to Istanbul before crossing into Syria \u2013 the same route taken by Begum three months earlier. All four ended up in Raqqa, where they were married off to jihadists who had come to Syria from around the world. Speaking to the Times, Shamima Begum confirmed that Sultana had been killed, aged 17, in an airstrike in May 2016. Shamina Begum said she heard two weeks ago that Amira Abase and Sharmeena Begum were still alive. They had decided to stay on in Baghuz, Isis\u2019s last stronghold, where she last saw them in June.",

As the country edges closer to leaving the EU, the charity Electrical Safety First (ESF) wants the government to prioritise consumer safety and protection, regardless of the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, which could be the UK crashing out without a deal. In a Brexit warning to be published this week, it says EU legislation surrounding safety standards on electrical goods, as well as consumer protection rights, must continue to be mirrored in UK law to ensure all electrical items are safe, so consumers are protected from the risk of substandard or counterfeit products. Fake and unofficial electrical products can pose a much greater risk to life than items such as clothing, including from electrocution and fire. But any watering down or deregulation of existing standards could make the UK a magnet for cheap, substandard or counterfeit products, the ESF warns. Research by the charity last year found that one in three UK consumers \u2013 about 18 million people \u2013 had mistakenly bought a counterfeit electrical item online. Products with safety flaws ranged from large household appliances such as tumble dryers, to kettles, phones and chargers, travel adaptors, hair straighteners and Kodi boxes, which allow users to stream content from apps and on-demand services. Phil Buckle, the chief executive of the ESF, said: \u201cNo outcome from the ongoing EU-UK negotiations should be to the detriment of safety standards or consumer protection rights. \u201cThe risks posed by substandard and counterfeit electrical products are a very real threat to consumers\u2019 safety. Electricity is responsible for more than half of accidental domestic fires in England and any weakening of such standards could see this figure rise in the future. \u201cIt is essential that enforcement bodies, which serve on the frontline in the fight against substandard and counterfeit electrical items, are adequately resourced to be as effective as possible as we depart from the European Union.\u201d According to the European commission, customs authorities across the EU seized an estimated 5m more counterfeit items in 2015 than the previous year \u2013 a 15% increase. China is the main source of counterfeit goods (41%), followed by Montenegro, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Benin. After Brexit, the UK will need to assume greater responsibility surrounding enforcement and checks of imports to assess compliance with new customs controls, the ESF says. To do so effectively, enforcement bodies, such as trading standards, must be adequately funded to take on this increase in responsibility. The most recent National Trading Standards Safety at Ports and Borders report identified 1.2m unsafe or non-compliant goods, which could have caused 500 fires, 1,000 major injuries and 2,000 minor injuries. The consumer group Which? recently urged the government to use Brexit as an opportunity to set up a new national body, to be called the Consumer and Competition Authority, under the existing Competition and Markets Authority.",

It has pursued a \u201cdeliberate\u201d strategy to deceive parliament.</p> <p>In terms of how lawmakers across the globe need to think about Silicon Valley, the report is a landmark.

That Britain\u2019s electoral laws must be re-written from the bottom up; the report is unequivocal, they are not \u201cfit for purpose\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Facebook is an out-of-control train wreck that is destroying democracy and must be brought under control. The final report of parliament\u2019s inquiry into fake news and disinformation does not use this language, precisely, but it is, nonetheless, the report\u2019s central message. And the language it does use is no less damning. Facebook behaves like a \u201cdigital gangster\u201d. It considers itself to be \u201cahead of and beyond the law\u201d. It \u201cmisled\u201d parliament. It gave statements that were \u201cnot true\u201d. Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has treated British lawmakers with \u201ccontempt\u201d. It has pursued a \u201cdeliberate\u201d strategy to deceive parliament. In terms of how lawmakers across the globe need to think about Silicon Valley, the report is a landmark. The first really comprehensive attempt of a major legislative body to peer into the dark heart of a dark economy of data manipulation and voter influence. And to come up with a set of recommendations that its chair, the Conservative MP for Bournemouth, Damian Collins, says must involve \u201ca radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people\u201d. The scale of the report \u2013 it drew from 170 written submissions and evidence from 73 witnesses who were asked more than 4,350 questions \u2013 is without precedent. And it\u2019s what contributes to making its conclusions so damning: that the government must now act. That Facebook must be regulated. That Britain\u2019s electoral laws must be re-written from the bottom up; the report is unequivocal, they are not \u201cfit for purpose\u201d. And that the government must now open an independent investigation into foreign interference in all British elections since 2014. Cambridge Analytica was already on the committee\u2019s radar when the scandal broke in March last year. But, over the ensuing weeks and months, it interviewed an extraordinary cast of characters to drill down into the underlying machinery of the new political power structures. And the result \u2013 a doorstopper of a report covering multiple interconnected issues \u2013 damns Facebook not just once or twice but time and time again. It includes a new set of internal Facebook documents published today \u2013 from Six4Three, a software development company involved in a bitter legal dispute with Facebook \u2013 that show how Facebook was wheeling and dealing with users\u2019 data. How it traded access to their friends\u2019 data with companies prepared to buy its advertising. And how Facebook shut off access for others because it viewed them as \u201ccompetition\u201d. At one extraordinary point, the report references the \u201cRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act\u201d, or RICO, the tough US laws drawn up to tackle the mob and organied crime. Could Facebook\u2019s actions towards developers be viewed as RICO offences, the committee asked a Facebook executive. He said no. The report holds the possibility open. Certainly, the emails between executives carry more than a whiff of extortion. \u201cCommunicate in one-go to all apps that don\u2019t spend that those permission will be revoked,\u201d says one email. \u201cCommunicate to the rest that they need to open on NEKO [mobile ads] $250k a year to maintain access to data.\u201d But it\u2019s the sections concerning foreign interference that are perhaps the most damning. The report accuses Facebook\u2019s chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, of giving a statement to parliament about Russian interference that \u201cwe now know \u2026 was simply not true\u201d. And it\u2019s the government that stands to be most embarrassed. It has remained almost silent on the subject in the face of an accumulation of evidence detailed here and which the report pulls no punches about: it is as urgent an issue of national security as the poisoning of Sergei Skripal. In one of the most striking sections, it notes that the government\u2019s response to its interim report, a stunningly dry and boring document that dodged all the main issues, drew little attention in Britain. In Russia, though, it was another story. The report pulled the stats from parliament\u2019s website though and found that more people in Moscow (19.8% of visitors) had read it than those in London (17.8%). And it tears apart the government\u2019s official response that it has \u201cnot seen evidence of successful use of disinformation by foreign actors, including Russia\u201d. But it\u2019s the section on AIQ that perhaps goes to the heart of the problem of why the government is so allergic to investigating any of this. AIQ was the Canadian data firm that worked for Vote Leave and the chapter on its activities raises crucial questions that lead directly to key members of the government.

In a sign that workers\u2019 pay is gradually rising after a \u201clost decade\u201d of sluggish growth since the financial crisis, private-sector employers said they were expecting to award annual pay increases of about 2.5% on average this year, up from 2% at the end of last year. The research compiled by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and the recruitment group Adecco showed that basic pay expectations had increased to the highest level since it began tracking wage agreements in 2012. Almost three quarters of the 1,254 employers surveyed said they were finding it tough to fill vacancies in the first quarter of 2019, with manufacturing companies having the greatest difficulty. Despite growing concerns about the potential fallout for the British economy from no-deal Brexit, unemployment has hit the lowest rate since the mid 1970s, while record numbers of people are in work. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that pay growth across the country has risen to the highest level in a decade, as companies raise pay to attract workers. The latest official data show that the number of unemployed people per job vacancy has dropped to 1.6, down from 5.8 in 2011. Growing numbers of companies have expressed concern about the post-Brexit immigration system curtailing the number of migrant workers available to hire. Net migration from the rest of EU to the UK has slumped to a six-year low, exacerbating the difficulties facing companies looking to hire staff. Two-thirds of private sector firms in the CIPD/Adecco survey had increased their starting salaries in response to recruitment challenges, up from 56% in the final three months of last year. Keeping up with inflation was the main reason driving the expectations for increases in pay for the year ahead, followed by the need to match wages at other companies.

The RDG estimates that there are 55m separate fares available in Great Britain.</p> <p>However, the solution to Britain\u2019s railway problems remains deeply contentious.</p> <p>The train companies argue that regulations prevent them from being able to introduce technologies that would simplify buying tickets for passengers, allowing for airline-style ticketing systems for longer journeys and more \u201ctap in, tap out\u201d pay-as-you-go systems in urban areas, similar to Transport for London\u2019s Oyster system.</p> <p>Labour is calling for the nationalisation of the railways as train companies\u2019 franchises expire, which it says is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/03/uk-train-overcrowding-highest-level-in-years-labour\">necessary to cut fares</a> and deliver a simplified service.</p> <p>Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: \u201cThe Rail Delivery Group has neither the track record nor the ability to fix the railway\u2019s broken fares system.

The RDG insisted that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of users, including commuters, will not pay more for tickets.</p> <p>Among the losers could be those who travel longer distances immediately before or after peak hours, when ticket prices could increase in an attempt to push more people into empty trains during the peak period.</p> <p>The change would probably affect savvier bargain hunters who would be less able to take advantage of anomalies such as those around \u201csplit tickets\u201d, in which buying a single ticket can be much more expensive than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/feb/04/is-ticketclever-the-way-to-put-rail-fares-back-on-track-test\">splitting it into two journeys</a> \u2013 even when the route and timing are identical.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jan/02/rail-fare-increases-prompt-protests-at-stations-across-uk\">Rail fare increases prompt protests at stations across UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mick Cash, the general secretary of the rail union RMT, said the proposals would not stop passengers being \u201cripped off\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWhichever way the industry dresses this up, the fragmentation of privatisation will always lead to a complex mix of various fares across the network with passengers caught in the crossfire.\u201d</p> <p>However, Barry Doe, an independent rail fares expert who has previously described the train companies\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2006/jun/17/consumernews.moneysupplement\">overcharging as \u201ctantamount to legislated theft\u201d</a>, welcomed the attempt to reform the \u201coutdated\u201d system and said the proposals were an \u201cimportant vision of what the future could look like\u201d.</p> <p>A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: \u201cRDG\u2019s contribution to the Williams review is welcome.

      "bodyText": "Rail companies are offering part-time season tickets, a guarantee that passengers will get the cheapest prices and smartphone-based ticketing across the UK as part of a radical overhaul of British fares. The rail industry proposals include a weekly fare cap that allows commuters to avoid paying for their season ticket on the days when they don\u2019t use it \u2013 something long demanded by campaigners as a benefit for part-time workers. Another idea is a \u201cbest fare guarantee\u201d from the industry, meaning that customers will automatically pay the cheapest fare available at the time of purchase. It should be possible to use digital tickets \u2013 including on smartphones \u2013 on all journeys within five years if the plans are accepted, said the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), the industry body making the proposals. The proposals, which call for testing of the potential systems, pre-empt the findings of a government-sponsored review of the railways from former British Airways chief executive Keith Williams, due in the autumn. The review was commissioned after last year\u2019s botched summer timetabling changes that wrought havoc on England\u2019s railways and prompted a wave of calls for Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, to resign. The need for an overhaul of rail fares is almost universally recognised, with passengers often paying more than they need to because of complex options. The RDG estimates that there are 55m separate fares available in Great Britain. However, the solution to Britain\u2019s railway problems remains deeply contentious. The train companies argue that regulations prevent them from being able to introduce technologies that would simplify buying tickets for passengers, allowing for airline-style ticketing systems for longer journeys and more \u201ctap in, tap out\u201d pay-as-you-go systems in urban areas, similar to Transport for London\u2019s Oyster system. Labour is calling for the nationalisation of the railways as train companies\u2019 franchises expire, which it says is necessary to cut fares and deliver a simplified service. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: \u201cThe Rail Delivery Group has neither the track record nor the ability to fix the railway\u2019s broken fares system. A timid call for \u2018preparatory work to begin\u2019 and a series of trials just does not match up to the scale of the challenge. \u201cAny reforms led by private train companies will only serve the interests of shareholders of private train companies, leaving passengers stuck with a confusing and expensive fares system. We don\u2019t need tinkering around the edges; it needs to be replaced entirely.\u201d The RDG\u2019s proposals are designed to be revenue-neutral, meaning it foresees no need for extra government funding or higher average ticket prices. The promise of no extra cost for users or taxpayers is reliant on forecasts by the accounting firm KPMG that the changes would make rail travel more attractive, resulting in users taking an extra 300m journeys over a decade. Nevertheless, the changes would create some financial winners and losers. The RDG insisted that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of users, including commuters, will not pay more for tickets. Among the losers could be those who travel longer distances immediately before or after peak hours, when ticket prices could increase in an attempt to push more people into empty trains during the peak period. The change would probably affect savvier bargain hunters who would be less able to take advantage of anomalies such as those around \u201csplit tickets\u201d, in which buying a single ticket can be much more expensive than splitting it into two journeys \u2013 even when the route and timing are identical. Mick Cash, the general secretary of the rail union RMT, said the proposals would not stop passengers being \u201cripped off\u201d. He said: \u201cWhichever way the industry dresses this up, the fragmentation of privatisation will always lead to a complex mix of various fares across the network with passengers caught in the crossfire.\u201d However, Barry Doe, an independent rail fares expert who has previously described the train companies\u2019 overcharging as \u201ctantamount to legislated theft\u201d, welcomed the attempt to reform the \u201coutdated\u201d system and said the proposals were an \u201cimportant vision of what the future could look like\u201d. A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: \u201cRDG\u2019s contribution to the Williams review is welcome. In the short term, we are ready to work with the industry on how their proposals might work and be tested in the real world.\u201d",
