With Boris Johnson likely to become prime minister, and his Brexit strategy making no-deal looking ever more probable, it is one of the key questions of the day. But the answer is not obvious, partly because some Conservative pro-Europeans are not very clear about their intentions on this point. (For example, this morning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/boris-johnson-could-ignore-efforts-to-block-no-deal-says-raab\">Rory Stewart was saying he would not vote to bring down a Tory government, </a>but two weeks ago he was saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/13/conservative-leadership-tory-mps-start-voting-for-new-leader-live-news?page=with:block-5d024b4a8f080adae4897642#block-5d024b4a8f080adae4897642\">he would \u201cbring down\u201d Johnson if Johnson tried to prorogue parliament to facilitate no-deal.)</a></p> <p>In an interview on the World at One <strong>Phillip Lee</strong>, the former minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/12/justice-minister-phillip-lee-resign-over-brexit-policy\">who resigned last year to back a rebel amendment giving parliament more say over Brexit, </a>explained his thinking on this issue as a leading Tory pro-European. He said he and his colleagues needed to threaten to bring down the government - but that he did not expect it to happen. Here are his main points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lee said that Tory pro-Europeans like himself had to be as \u201cruthless\u201d as the European Research Group (or ERG, the pro-Brexit Tory caucus) and that that was why they had to keep open the option of voting against the government on a no confidence motion to prevent a no-deal Brexit. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nobody wants to vote no confidence in the government, nobody seeks to do that ... But ultimately if we believe truly that no-deal is unacceptable without the explicit consent of the public, then we have to leave everything on the table ...</p> <p>I\u2019ve watched as the ERG have essentially won through here, and have dictated terms, and they have done this, successfully I might add, by being ruthless and having a clear strategy throughout. And it\u2019s about time those of us who hold the belief that a no-deal on these terms is an unacceptable thing to be contemplating, that we also adopt exactly the same approach that the ERG have successfully undertaken in the last 12 months. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that there was a \u201ccollective madness\u201d in the Conservative party with people thinking a no-deal Brexit would be acceptable. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If somebody says to me \u2018Do I want to vote no confidence in the government\u2019, of course I don\u2019t. I\u2019m a Conservative, have been so for over 27 years. But I look on at this and I think there is a collective madness out there at the moment, in thinking that no-deal, and delivering it in this way, is acceptable, politically deliverable, and in the interests, socially and economically and geopolitically of my country - I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t see that.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he did not accept the idea that a no confidence vote would automatically lead to Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister</strong>. Another alternative might be some sort of government of national unity, headed by a backbencher, he said. But he said he was not aware of any conversations about a possible government of national unity taking place.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He also said that there were other parliamentary options, besides a vote of no confidence, that could be used to stop a new prime minister going for no-deal. </strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said that, because of the parliamentary opposition, he was \u201cconfident\u201d the next Conservative leader would conclude that a no-deal Brexit was \u201cjust not deliverable\u201d.</strong> Instead the new leader would conclude the only options were a referendum, a general election or revoking article 50, Lee said.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a170421efa69af3ce90c93f7087b41d67465405\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a170421efa69af3ce90c93f7087b41d67465405/0_0_1296_1296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phillip Lee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phillip Lee</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Conservative Party/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-26T17:16:06.183Z\">at 6.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1367828f081e872734f30c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-26T12:40:35.449Z\">1.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some tweets from the post-PMQs Labour party briefing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/1143855705260212229\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman says Labour will alight on \u201ca common position that people can row behind,\u201d on Brexit, \u201cin the next few weeks\u201d.

Over the last year PMQs has become increasingly low-voltage; not irrelevant, because important issues are still being raised and debated, but it now longer feels like the forum where the great political conflicts of the day are being settled. And now that Theresa May is effectively working her notice the problem has intensified. Jeremy Corbyn chose to ask her about arms sales to Saudi Arabia, a cause he cares about passionately, and while it was good to see the topic get an airing (Corbyn did manage to make May squirm reasonably successfully, although she hit back very firmly in her final answer), it still felt like displacement activity, because he was ignoring the great crisis facing the country.

It does not cover \u201cmore complex behind the border regulatory issues affecting trade\u201d, he says.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d132e468f082364d7cf1747\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-26T08:39:08.477Z\">9.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris\">Boris Johnson</a> would be able to ignore parliament\u2019s efforts to stop a no-deal Brexit and blame the EU if it refuses to give the UK a better deal, <strong>Dominic Raab,</strong> the former Brexit secretary, has said. As my colleagues<strong> Rowena Mason </strong>and<strong> Matthew Weaver</strong> report, Raab, who is now backing Johnson for the Tory leadership, told the Today programme that any motion from MPs against a no-deal Brexit would have \u201czero legal effect\u201d and could be overridden. But <strong>Rory Stewart,</strong> the international development secretary who is now backing Jeremy Hunt for the leadership, told the same programme that parliament had not exhausted all options to prevent no deal. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Parliament is against no deal. It is only the legal default because parliament made it the legal default. Parliament can unmake it the legal default. There are many, many opportunities in legislation that have to brought forward, that could be amended in order to stop a no-deal Brexit.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is our full write-up of the Raab and Stewart interviews.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/boris-johnson-could-ignore-efforts-to-block-no-deal-says-raab\">Boris Johnson could ignore efforts to block no deal, says Raab</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d1321288f081e872734ef78\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-26T08:23:53.693Z\">9.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fox accuses Johnson of peddling 'supposition' not fact on Brexit trade options</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At one stage in his TalkRadio interview yesterday Boris Johnson described his Brexit strategy as a set of three preferences, with plan A as his preference, plan B as his fallback, and plan C as the fallback to the fallback. <strong>Charlie Cooper</strong> sums them up well <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/politico-london-playbook-presented-by-british-ukrainian-chamber-of-commerce-do-or-die-brexit-positions-revenge-of-the-mac/\">in the Politico Europe London Playbook briefing </a>this morning.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Plan A:</strong> A deal with the EU replacing the Northern Ireland backstop aspect of May\u2019s withdrawal agreement with \u201calternative arrangements\u201d that will be brought up to speed during a standstill transition period much like the one agreed by May. NB: The EU has said repeatedly the withdrawal agreement is not up for renegotiation.</p> <p><strong>Plan B:</strong> If (when?) the EU says no, seek agreement from Brussels for a standstill on tariff rates under article 24 of the World Trade Organisation\u2019s general agreement on tariffs and trade (sigh) while the two sides work towards a free trade agreement.</p> <p><strong>Plan C:</strong> If this fails, no deal on October 31 with full tariffs on Day 1, with only those preparations and parachute arrangements unilaterally planned by the U.K and the EU in place. Throughout, the \u00a339bn divorce payment agreed by May will be withheld till Johnson is satisfied by the EU\u2019s commitments on trade.</p> </blockquote> <p>Given that plan A is almost certainly impossible - even if the EU was willing to negotiate a new withdrawal agreement, which it says it isn\u2019t, almost no one thinks that such a deal could be signed and legislated for in the UK before 31 October - there is increased focus on plan B. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jun/25/tory-leadership-latest-news-boris-johnson-rudd-tells-boris-johnson-optimism-not-enough-to-deliver-brexit-live-news?page=with:block-5d11e5a78f080e828514efcc#block-5d11e5a78f080e828514efcc\">Yesterday Johnson scaled down his assertions about the potential of article 24,</a> accepting that the UK could not use it unilaterally, but still claiming it was a viable means of keeping EU-UK trade tariff fee in the event of there being no deal.</p> <p>But, overnight, <strong>Liam Fox</strong>, the international trade secretary has pitched in, using an article to effectively accuse Johnson of of peddling \u201csupposition\u201d not fact on this point. Fox is supporting Jeremy Hunt for the Tory leadership. But he is also a hardline Brexiter, whose instinctive Brexit views are much closer to Johnson\u2019s than Hunt. And, given his cabinet job, he is also the one minister who ought to know what he is talking about on the matter of Gatt.</p> <p>Here is <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/facts-gatt-article-xxiv-the-rt-hon-dr-liam-fox-mp\">LinkedIn article. </a> And here is an extract: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Some commentators have suggested that, in a \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario, the UK could maintain its existing trading relationship with the European Union for up to ten years by claiming exemption from the WTO\u2019s rules, under article XXIV:5 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (Gatt).</em></p> <p><em>This is not the case. Gatt</em><em> article XXIV permits the establishment of free trade agreements and customs unions as an exception to the \u2018most favoured nation\u2019 principle at the WTO - namely, that WTO members cannot give preferential treatment to products and services originating from one trading partner over others.</em></p> <p><em>However, in order to benefit from the terms of article XXIV, there must be an agreement between two WTO members as to the elimination of duties and other restrictive regulations on substantially all trade. Therefore, article XXIV would not, by itself, allow the UK to maintain tariff-free trade with the EU in the absence of a negotiated agreement ...</em></p> <p><em>A \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario, by definition, suggests that there would be no mutual agreement between the UK and the EU on any temporary or permanent arrangement. In those circumstances article XXIV cannot be used.</em></p> <p><em>The European Union has made it clear on a number of occasions that full tariffs will be applied to the United Kingdom in the event of \u2018no-deal\u2019.</em></p> <p><em>The director-general of the WTO, Roberto Azevedo, has also confirmed there must be a bilateral agreement between the EU and the UK in order to claim an implementation period under Gatt article XXIV. \u201cOnce they have an agreement I think article XXIV could give them some time for implementation of that agreement,\u201d he told Bloomberg. \u201cBut the first question is the agreement itself\u201d ...</em></p> <p><em>It is important that public debate on this topic is conducted on the basis of fact rather than supposition, so that we are able to make decisions in the best interests of our country.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>We will doubtless hear much more on this today, including from Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, who is giving evidence to MPs. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jun/25/tory-leadership-latest-news-boris-johnson-rudd-tells-boris-johnson-optimism-not-enough-to-deliver-brexit-live-news?page=with:block-5d11e5a78f080e828514efcc#block-5d11e5a78f080e828514efcc\">At one point yesterday Johnson said that Carney was wrong about Gatt </a>- before he retracted and accepted (correctly) that Carney might not have said what Johnson thought he had said.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, gives a speech to the Telegraph\u2019s future of trade and export forum.</p> <p><em>10am: </em>Damian Hinds, the education secretary, gives evidence to the Commons education committee.</p> <p><em>10am:</em> Jo Swinson and Sir Ed Davey take part in a Lib Dem leadership hustings in the Commons.</p> <p><em>10.15am: </em>Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee.</p> <p><em>12pm: </em>Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.</p> <p><em>12pm:</em> Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, speaks at a Policy Exchange event on the backstop.</p> <p><em>Afternoon: </em>Theresa May gives a speech on housing in Manchester.</p> <p><em>3pm:</em> Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, gives evidence to the Commons international development committee.</p> <p>As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on the Tory leadership contest.

      "bodyText": "Brexit watcher Christopher James has reservations about the Grieve/Beckett plan to derail a no-deal Brexit via an amendment: His concerns are echoed elsewhere. This from tortoise\u2019s Chris Cook and the Observer\u2019s Michael Savage: And this from the ex-director of legislative affairs at No 10, Nikki da Costa: That\u2019s it from me. Goodnight and thanks for tuning in. And this from Kevin Schofield from PoliticsHome on the matter: This from MP Luciana Berger, who left the Labour party earlier this year because she felt it had become an \u201cinstitutionally anti-Semitic\u201d party: This from Sky\u2019s Tom Rayner, in reaction to Berger\u2019s tweet above: This just in from my colleague Patrick Wintour on the Chris Williamson case. Read the whole thread he has retweeted. My colleague Rowena Mason has written up a summary of the Tory hustings: Perhaps unsurprisingly, Chris Williamson\u2019s readmission to the Labour party is generating more comments on Twitter than the Tory hustings. Here my colleague Jessica Elgot\u2019s story: This from Ian Austin MP, formerly Labour and now independent: And this from Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips MP: This from Labour MP Stella Creasy: This from The Times\u2019 Henry Zeffman: And this from Sky News\u2019 Tom Rayner: This from The Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn: My colleagues Rowena Mason and Heather Stewart have written a piece about a planned Tory MP attempt to throw a spanner in the works of no-deal proceedings. This is from the BBC\u2019s Glenn Campbell: An interesting piece of info from the Observer\u2019s Michael Savage: This from the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar: Conservative MP Mark Francois, the deputy chairman of the European Reserach Group, has told Robert Peston that Boris Johnson has promised the ERG not to bring the withdrawal agreement back for another vote. This from the Spectator\u2019s Andrew Neill on Hunt\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s comments regarding the rules of Gatt24 in case of a no-deal exit: Jeremy Hunt just posted this video on Twitter: And this is from the official BackBoris campaign: Jeremy Hunt just told Peston on ITV that he \u201cpresumes from what Boris is saying\u201d that Johnson would call a general election in case parliament takes no-deal off the table. I thought I\u2019d heard Johnson say the opposite, but who knows with all this mumbling. This from Buzzfeed\u2019s Emily Ashton: I seem to have missed that Boris Johnson said he would not include Nigel Farage in the Brexit negotiations. This from SkyNews: I\u2019ll now be gathering some reactions to the Tory hustings. This from my colleague Owen Gibson: The hustings have wrapped up now. Asked what the biggest threat is post-Brexit, Johnson says Britain faces real problems in regard to Iran, the Middle East in general, and Russia. He mentions the Skripal poisonings, and how he was tasked, as foreign secretary, to convince other countries that Russia had been behind the attacks, and to expel diplomats, which he says was managed successfully. What will he do about knife crime? He says when he was mayor of London, a \u201cmassive programme of stop and search\u201d took about 11,000 knives off the streets of the capital, says this halved the murder rate. Adds that mothers of murdered kids want this to happen. Is he concerned about creeping NHS privatisation? Johnson says under his premiership everyone would remain entitled to free health care, particularly under a free trade deal with the US. How would he rebalance the north-south divide as PM? Johnson says transport is \u201cthe great unsung liberator\u201d of the small man, gives HS2 as an example, says some towns in the north are \u201cless happy\u201d, and that \u201cthere are ways\u201d to stimulate them, via infrastructure, broadband, education, and devolution. And that\u2019s it from him, his time is up. Q: What would his housing policy be? Johnson says he would \u201cencourage better, more housing, but not on greenbelt sites\u201d. He draws again on his mayor of London experience and takes a dig at Sadiq Khan: \u201cWe are not building enough at the moment.\u201d He says better infrastructure and better broadband and education would encourage people to migrate to towns across the country, and bring jobs to areas other than London. As he spells this vision out, Johnson sounds, for the first time in this session, coherent and confident. Asked about utility prices, Johnson says they are too high, and that \u201cthere may be things we can do\u201d. Boris Johnson just misremembered Liam Fox\u2019s name, after which he said, slowly: \u201cLiam Fox, trade secretary\u201d. Johnson now says \u201cit didn\u2019t seem to me\u201d that he had suggested being prepared to circumvent parliament in order to get his Brexit outcome. Adds he does not believe no-deal will happen, and that the odds for this are \u201ca million to one against\u201d. Would he call a general election in case parliament blocks no deal? No, he would not, Johnson says. Would he suspend parliament? Johnson refuses to answer the question, says Tories are facing an \u201cexistential threat\u201d, and that until Brexit is \u201cover the line\u201d there can\u2019t be talk of a general election. Q: How would he get young people to vote for the Tories? Johnson says via appealing to them with policies in the areas of housing, environment, and one \u201ccrucial thing\u201d: the \u201cexcessive burden\u201d of student debt. And the solution \u201cmay lie in the interest rate\u201d, or elsewhere. Q: How will he unite the country and heal Brexit divisons? His answer is erratic, excuse my inability to note down one clear line it contained. Q: What will his stance be on immigration? And how will he avoid his immigration policies being viewed as xenophobic? Johnson says he doesn\u2019t think there has been any other Tory politician as committed to talent as he has been, \u201cbut I do believe it should be controlled.\u201d Says he is in favour of an Australia-style points-based system. Who would be in his cabinet? He wants a more positive approach to Brexit, but wants to \u201cleave it at that\u201d, says he \u201cmade no promises\u201d. Enter Boris Johnson. He opens his statement by saying the Tory party is \u201cin crisis\u201d. These three things, Johnson says, need to happen: 1) \u201cWe need to come out of the EU on 31 October\u201d, with the help of someone who believes in the Brexit project 2) \u201cWe need to unite our party and our country\u201d (and he says he was able to unite Londoners as mayor). 3) Faster broadband for all parts of the country And he\u2019s got a 4th: 4) Get the Tory party ready to fend off Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party at a general election. The final question to Hunt is what he would do to improve children\u2019s mental health. Hunt says he wants to employ an extra 19,000 people to tackle the youth mental health crisis, and that he wants the UK to be the first country to take children\u2019s mental health seriously. And that\u2019s it for him, his time is up. Next question is about how Hunt would reduce knife crime. He says the reduction in police numbers went too far, the Conservatives had to make difficult fiscal decisions post-financial crash, and the reductions in both police spending and social care \u201cwent too far\u201d, and this would have to change. Says despite this scenario, he managed to negotiate an extra \u00a320bn for the NHS as health secretary. Hunt is asked about tariffs in case of no-deal. He says \u201cthere isn\u2019t a no-deal route\u201d in regard to Gatt 24 that wouldn\u2019t require both sides to consent. Asked whether Boris Johnson has been lying in that regard, Hunt gives an evasive answer and says he wouldn\u2019t exactly call it lying. Hunt is asked what his own faults are. Answer: \u201cI certainly have plenty of faults.\u201d But he adds it would \u201cdemean the competition\u201d if he and Boris Johnson only pointed fingers at each other. Q: How will he ensure the north of the country is getting a better deal if he becomes PM? Hunt says he is backing the Northern Powerhouse rail, and that he wants the UK to be \u201cthe world\u2019s next Silicon Valley\u201d. He wants a \u201cnorthern tech-triangle\u201d, like the \u201cLondon-Oxford-Cambridge triangle\u201d in the south. Hunt is asked whether he would simply go from Brexit extension to extension if he became PM. Hunt says he wouldn\u2019t. \u201cI will leave without a deal, [...] but I will do so with a heavy heart.\u201d Q: How confident are you that you can beat both Corbyn and Farage at a next general election? Hunt: \u201cMy absolute commitment is to not provoke a general election before we have left.\u201d Says Conservative Party is the actual party standing up for small people, not Labour, and the party that \u201cwalks the walk\u201d in terms of social justice, to a bit of jeering from the audience. Hunt now says he will give \u201cfull rights\u201d to the 3 million EU nationals in the UK. A question about big infrastructure projects: Would he support HS2 and a third Heathrow runway? Hunt says he would back both as PM. Hunt says US-UK relationship should be treated as \u201csacred\u201d. He is asked about the future of the NHS in case of no-deal and the potential threat of \u201ccreeping privatisation\u201d of the health service. Hunt said president Trump misunderstood British demonstrators campaigning for better NHS funding. Hunt now speaks about the rise of China, which, he says, \u201cis not a democracy\u201d, mentions his wife, and jokes: \u201cGot the nationality right!\u201d Hunt says he\u2019ll be the first ever PM with \u201ca background as an entrepreneur\u201d, and someone prepared to walk away \u201cif we don\u2019t get what what we need\u201d. He says he followed his Navy dad around the country, and repeats his pledge to increase defence spending beyond 2% of GDP, and says he wants to abolish illiteracy. Says he\u2019ll also be \u201cthe first PM for half a century\u201d to win in a marginal seat. Adds: \u201cI won\u2019t fight an election until we\u2019ve left the European Union\u201d. Then refers to the Labour party as a \u201ccrocodile in the water\u201d, and the \u201cmost dangerous, anti-western Labour party we\u2019ve ever had\u201d. And it\u2019s starting: The first ever Tory live online hustings. The host is journalist Hannah Vaughan Jones. She says the candidates have not been privy to any of the questions. She is now introducing Jeremy Hunt. Before the fun begins, here a piece by my colleague Rowena Mason on Boris Johnson\u2019s testosterone-laden campaign. Hello everyone. The live Tory hustings are starting shortly. Both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt will be answering questions from members of the public put to them by the host from 7pm for 60 minutes. The event is streamed live on Facebook and Twitter, and uploaded to YouTube, via the Conservative party channels. On Twitter, people wanting to put questions are asked to use the #AskTheNextPM hashtag. Jeremy Hunt, the underdog in the race for the Tory leadership, has claimed that Boris Johnson cannot be trusted to keep his promise to deliver Brexit by 31 October in all circumstances. (See 2.55pm.) Hunt was speaking a day after Johnson made his \u201cdo or die\u201d commitment to hit the October Brexit deadline a key issue in the contest. Phillip Lee, a pro-European former minister, said his party was gripped by \u201ccollective madness\u201d because Brexiters backing Johnson were arguing a no-deal Brexit - which seems increasingly probable under Johnson\u2019s declared Brexit strategy - would be acceptable. (See 2.27pm.) Later, at 7pm, Johnson and Hunt will both be taking part in a digital hustings. We will be covering that live here. Theresa May has defended Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt after they were labelled the most incompetent foreign and health secretaries in a century. Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have hit back at the trade secretary, Liam Fox, for \u201cludicrously tilting at windmills\u201d, after he rejected Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that exporters would be spared tariffs if Britain left the EU without a deal. Boris Johnson has appointed Lynton Crosby\u2019s business partner Mark Fullbrook to sharpen up his Conservative leadership campaign. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman has insisted the Labour leader makes his own decisions, as he hit back against claims by Margaret Beckett that some of Corbyn\u2019s close aides wanted Britain to leave the EU, \u201cno matter what\u201d. Mark Carney has indicated that the Bank of England could have to cut interest rates should Britain crash out of the EU without a deal as he said the mounting risks of such a scenario were slowing down growth. The Liberal Democrat leadership candidate Ed Davey has suggested his party could back Yvette Cooper or Hilary Benn as head of a government of national unity, to be installed instead of a general election if the government lost a no-confidence vote. MP Chris Williamson has been readmitted to the Labour party after he was suspended for suggesting the party had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d about antisemitism. Ian Austin, who sits as an independent MP after leaving Labour because he did not think it was taking antisemitism seriously, said this decision was a disgrace. Theresa May is to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin when the two leaders attend the G20 summit in Osaka, Downing Street has said. Thousands of people have gathered around Westminster to call on their MPs to take urgent action on the climate and environmental \u201cemergency\u201d. An estimated 12,000 people attended, according to organisers. Shaun Spiers, chair of Greener UK, one of the groups behind the mass lobby, said: The broad range of people and organisations supporting the lobby shows the feeling across the country that urgent action is needed, starting with an ambitious environment bill and policies that put us on track for net zero emissions by 2045. The time to act is now. Michael Russell, the Scottish government\u2019s constitutional relations secretary, has given MSPs details of its plans for a citizens\u2019 assembly to consider Scotland\u2019s future and Brexit. He told them: We have to keep innovating in order to keep moving. When we see, in the Brexit issue, a complete breakdown in trust between politicians and people, surely it should inspire all of us, no matter our political allegiance, to find new ways to bring politicians and people together to resolve deep seated division. Citizens\u2019 assemblies are becoming an established way for mature democracies to engage with complex and contested issues on an inclusive, informed and respectful basis. That is what we want for Scotland. The Scottish government has also set up a website for the assembly. Rory Stewart has said it would be \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to leave his job as international development secretary were Boris Johnson to become the next prime minister. The Scottish government is to boost the incomes of the country\u2019s poorest families by offering them \u00a310 a week for every child in addition to child benefit payments. The government\u2019s failure to get to grips with the escalating financial crisis in social care has put tens of thousands of older and disabled people at risk of being denied basic support such as help with washing and dressing, care chiefs have warned. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. But my colleague Jedidajah Otte will be picking the blog up again before 7pm to cover the Tory hustings. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, has said she is backing Jeremy Hunt fo Tory leader. Her endorsement hasn\u2019t always been a guarantee of success. In earlier stages of the contest she backed first Sajid Javid, and then Michael Gove, but they were both eliminated. In her speech on housing in Manchester this afternoon Theresa May said that the government would be publishing an action plan for reforms to social housing in September. It was partly inspired by the evidence given by Grenfell Tower residents, she said. She went on: It will include the creation of a stronger consumer regulation regime for social housing, enhancing tenants\u2019 rights and making it easier to enforce them. Changes to the way complaints are resolved, so that tenants know exactly how to raise concerns and can be confident their voices will be heard and acted on. Empowering residents still further by requiring landlords to demonstrate how they have engaged with their tenants. And a commitment to further boost the supply of high-quality social housing through the affordable homes programme and other funding. A hundred years after the introduction of Britain\u2019s first council houses, I want to see not just homes that people have to live in but homes they want to live in, homes they can be proud to live in. But May\u2019s speech was mostly about reflecting on her record, not looking to the future. She said that she had identified housing as a key issue when she took office and, among the achievements she listed, she said the government: Was on course to deliver 1m new homes by 2020, as promised in the 2015 Conservative manifesto. Had created a Ministry of Housing. Had set up a \u00a35.5bn housing infrastructure fund to allow developers to build on sites that were previously not viable. Seen the number of first-time buyers reach the highest level for more than a decade. Abolished the housing revenue account (HRA) cap, allowing councils to build council houses. Announced plans to repeal section 21 of the Housing Act, ending so-called \u201cno fault\u201d evictions. Set up the Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission. The Corbynite MP Chris Williamson has been readmitted to Labour, PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield reports. Williamson was suspended in February after saying Labour had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d about allegations of antisemitism in the party. Labour readmitted Williamson after a national executive committee panel considered his case and issued him with a formal warning. A party source said: An NEC panel, advised by an independent barrister, found Chris Williamson had breached the party\u2019s rules and gave him a formal sanction. He could face further, more severe, action if he repeats any similar comments or behaviour. Tonight the Conservatives are holding a digital hustings. People are invited to submit questions on Twitter or via Facebook, and a moderator, the journalist Hannah Vaughan Jones, will be reading them out for Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt to answer in person. There will be no studio audience, but there people will be able to watch a live feed. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has said the UK should leave the EU by 31 October. As Sky\u2019s Kate McCann report, Foster made the comments, which support Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit stance, not Jeremy Hunt\u2019s, at an event at lunchtime. And on a campaign visit earlier, Jeremy Hunt accused Boris Johnson of making a promise, to deliver Brexit by 31 October, that he was unlikely to keep. He said: You should only, if you want to be prime minister, make promises you can actually deliver and my concern about that fixed date is that we know parliament will try and stop a no-deal Brexit and then you could end up tripping into a general election, that puts Corbyn in Downing Street and there\u2019ll be no Brexit at all. I\u2019m the person who\u2019s far, far more likely to deliver Brexit by October 31 because I can negotiate a deal with the European Union and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. Yesterday Boris Johnson revealed his secret model bus-making habit. Today, in an interview with Radio 2\u2019s Jeremy Vine, Jeremy Hunt, Johnson\u2019s rival for the Tory leadership, spoke about his passion for the lambada. He told the programme: When I was elected as an MP in 2005 my big passion was lambada dancing, I have a lot of Brazilian friends, I used to go to the carnival in Brazil. This just brings back some happy memories. This is a dance for single people and quite an intimate dance so perhaps not one for the married listeners. Earlier this government the Welsh government switched its position on Brexit and committed itself to firmly arguing for a referendum and for the UK to remain in the EU. Originally it had argued for a soft Brexit, to honour the referendum result. But it switched to backing remain because it concluded that a soft Brexit was not an option. The Scottish government is also arguing for remain. But what makes the Welsh government decision potentially significant is that the Welsh government is run by Labour, meaning that its new position increases the pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to commit the party to backing remain in a future referendum. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, has written an open letter to all Welsh MPs urging them to back a second referendum. He says his government is backing remain because, with the Tory leadership election, the UK is now \u201calmost certainly facing a straight choice between a no-deal and remain in the EU\u201d. Crashing out of the UK at Halloween could result in a \u201cflurry of profit warnings\u201d from publicly listed companies in November, MPs have been warned. As my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports, the Institute for Chartered Accountants for England and Wales (ICAEW) told MPs that this could have a \u201csystemic\u201d impact on the confidence in the British economy. Are there enough Tory MPs willing to vote down their own government in a no confidence debate to stop a no-deal Brexit? With Boris Johnson likely to become prime minister, and his Brexit strategy making no-deal looking ever more probable, it is one of the key questions of the day. But the answer is not obvious, partly because some Conservative pro-Europeans are not very clear about their intentions on this point. (For example, this morning Rory Stewart was saying he would not vote to bring down a Tory government, but two weeks ago he was saying he would \u201cbring down\u201d Johnson if Johnson tried to prorogue parliament to facilitate no-deal.) In an interview on the World at One Phillip Lee, the former minister who resigned last year to back a rebel amendment giving parliament more say over Brexit, explained his thinking on this issue as a leading Tory pro-European. He said he and his colleagues needed to threaten to bring down the government - but that he did not expect it to happen. Here are his main points. Lee said that Tory pro-Europeans like himself had to be as \u201cruthless\u201d as the European Research Group (or ERG, the pro-Brexit Tory caucus) and that that was why they had to keep open the option of voting against the government on a no confidence motion to prevent a no-deal Brexit. He said: Nobody wants to vote no confidence in the government, nobody seeks to do that ... But ultimately if we believe truly that no-deal is unacceptable without the explicit consent of the public, then we have to leave everything on the table ... I\u2019ve watched as the ERG have essentially won through here, and have dictated terms, and they have done this, successfully I might add, by being ruthless and having a clear strategy throughout. And it\u2019s about time those of us who hold the belief that a no-deal on these terms is an unacceptable thing to be contemplating, that we also adopt exactly the same approach that the ERG have successfully undertaken in the last 12 months. He said that there was a \u201ccollective madness\u201d in the Conservative party with people thinking a no-deal Brexit would be acceptable. He said: If somebody says to me \u2018Do I want to vote no confidence in the government\u2019, of course I don\u2019t. I\u2019m a Conservative, have been so for over 27 years. But I look on at this and I think there is a collective madness out there at the moment, in thinking that no-deal, and delivering it in this way, is acceptable, politically deliverable, and in the interests, socially and economically and geopolitically of my country - I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t see that. He said he did not accept the idea that a no confidence vote would automatically lead to Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister. Another alternative might be some sort of government of national unity, headed by a backbencher, he said. But he said he was not aware of any conversations about a possible government of national unity taking place. He also said that there were other parliamentary options, besides a vote of no confidence, that could be used to stop a new prime minister going for no-deal. He said that, because of the parliamentary opposition, he was \u201cconfident\u201d the next Conservative leader would conclude that a no-deal Brexit was \u201cjust not deliverable\u201d. Instead the new leader would conclude the only options were a referendum, a general election or revoking article 50, Lee said. Here are some tweets from the post-PMQs Labour party briefing. This is what Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, said about Boris Johnson at PMQs. On the one hand the Tories are asking people to put their faith in the most incompetent foreign secretary in a century, a man who has made a career out of lying, who has spent this week avoiding the media, staging photos and playing to the extreme delusions of the Tory shires. Blackford also criticised Jeremy Hunt, calling him \u201cthe most incompetent health secretary in our history\u201d, but it was what he said about Johnson that infuriated Tory MPs because Commons rules normally stop MPs accusing each other directly of lying. Frankly, does anyone care? Over the last year PMQs has become increasingly low-voltage; not irrelevant, because important issues are still being raised and debated, but it now longer feels like the forum where the great political conflicts of the day are being settled. And now that Theresa May is effectively working her notice the problem has intensified. Jeremy Corbyn chose to ask her about arms sales to Saudi Arabia, a cause he cares about passionately, and while it was good to see the topic get an airing (Corbyn did manage to make May squirm reasonably successfully, although she hit back very firmly in her final answer), it still felt like displacement activity, because he was ignoring the great crisis facing the country. The SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford is always much more comfortable raising Brexit and for the second week in a row he used PMQs to engage in Boris Johnson character assassination. But without Johnson there to respond, it was like arm wrestling without an opponent. Still, only four more of these to go, and then come September, when the new PM is due at the despatch box for the first time, it might all liven up again. In response to a point of order about why he did not ask Ian Blackford to withdraw what he said about Boris Johnson making a career out of lying, John Bercow, the Speaker, says he did not hear a specific allegation of dishonesty. (See 12.25pm.) He says what he did hear was distasteful, but he did not judge it disorderly. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, says Britons who were victims of IRA violence have not received compensation from the Libyan government, which provided the IRA with weapons, but Americans have. May says she has discussed this issue with the Libyan authorities. Gillian Keegan, a Conservative, asks about cancer care in West Sussex. May says cancer care is addressed in the NHS\u2019s long-term plan. She accepts that it is hard for patients if they are asked to travel long distances for treatment. The SNP\u2019s Marion Fellows says figures out today show that \u00a3973m is owed in unpaid child maintenance. The Child Maintenance Service does not use all the powers available to it to get parents to pay up, she says. Will May review this? May says this is a difficult area. For many years governments have been trying to get this right. The simplified system in place now is better than what was there before, but she will ask the relevant department to look at this. Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative, asks about Nice, and the drug Spinraza, which is used to treat spinal muscular atrophy. He says Nice said this drug would be available in a statement on its website, and then had to clarify, meaning his constituent could not access it. May says this should not have happened. Unusually, John Bercow, the Speaker, intervenes to say if Rees-Mogg wants a debate on this before the summer recess, that debate will take place. Labour\u2019s Emma Dent Coad asks May to use her final days in office to respond to Grenfell Tower issues, including setting up a social housing regulator with teeth. May says the government has already taken many measures in response to the Grenfell tragedy. Sir John Hayes, a Conservative, asks May to use the tax system to steer resources away from big monoliths to small, local businesses. May says the government has already introduced reforms to business rates. Labour\u2019s Stephen Pound says May could be distracted by her imminent departure. But will she spare a thought for the 1m-plus PHMOs -pensioner households missing out (on benefits). May says the government wants people entitled to benefits to get them. Labour\u2019s Kerry McCarthy asks about the case of a 14-year-old girl with autism placed in a secure unit 150 miles away from home. May says the government has been looking at this issue very carefully. It wants more funding to be available for more facilities. Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative former international development secretary, asks May if she accepts the UK should move to much more neutral position on Yemen. May says the government is working for peace in Yemen. Labour\u2019s Jo Stevens asks about a constituent who was abducted and taken to Libya. She asks if May will take up this case, and May says she will ensure that happens. Labour\u2019s Karen Lee asks if May accepts her actions have made a no-deal Brexit more likely. May says she voted three times for a deal. Labour did not, she says. Alistair Burt, the former Middle East minister, asks May if she agrees that Corbyn\u2019s comments about Yemen were one-sided. Both sides have committed atrocities, he says. May does agree. Labour\u2019s Khalid Mahmood asks about the recent poll showing that almost half of Conservative party members would not want to see a Muslim prime minister. Will May order an inquiry into what is increasingly a nasty party? May says the Conservative party takes Islamphobia very seriously. People have been thrown out of the party. She says this contrasts with Labour\u2019s approach to antisemitism. It is easier to get thrown out of Labour for voting Lib Dem than for antisemitism, she says. Paul Masterton, a Conservative, asks about the Wimbledon tournament. May offers her wishes to the players taking part. Suella Braverman, the Conservative MP, says she will soon give birth. She says she is glad proxy voting has been introduced. She asks May to back a campaign for safer roads. May wishes Braverman the best for her birth. And she commends the campaign. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, says the Scottish government was the first in the UK to declare a climate emergency. Quoting Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cdo or die\u201d comment, he asks May to condemn the idea of a no-deal Brexit. May says as PM she voted three times for a Brexit deal. Blackford says it is no wonder May is leaving, that was no answer. The Tories are asking the country to put their faith in the worst foreign secretary in the last 100 years, \u201ca man who has made his career out of lying\u201d. Blackford condemns Boris Johnson as \u201ca man who has made a career out of lying\u201d. Blackford also criticises Jeremy Hunt, but it is hard to hear because so many Tories are shouting \u201cwithdraw\u201d. He says neither candidate is fit to be PM. May says either candidate would be better than the MPs sitting on Blackford\u2019s bench. Corbyn says the government stop the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia. He asks if May accepts the UN assessment that the crown prince was involved in the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. May says she has raised this case with the Saudi authorities. She wants the investigation to proceed. Corbyn says more than 200,000 people have been killed from the war in Yemen. The court of appeal judgment should be a wake-up call, he says. He says the government should accept it. May says bringing peace to the Yemen is exactly what the government is working on with its diplomatic partners. She says the relationship with Saudi Arabia has saved lives in the UK. But let\u2019s look at Corbyn\u2019s sympathies. After the Salisbury poisoning attack, Corbyn sympathised with Russia. When the IRA were killing Britons, he sympathised with them. And in the recent crisis in the Gulf, he sided with Iran. He is not fit to be prime minister, she says. Corbyn says the PM does not understand the depth of feeling on this matter. It is estimated that more than 200,000 people are being killed in this conflict, many of them children. If the Saudi government say they are respecting human rights, do we ignore all evidence to the contrary? May says while the government is appealing against the court case, it will not be approving new export licences for arms to Saudi Arabia. She says the government is concerned about the humanitarian situation in Yemen. It has allocated more than \u00a3700m for aid. Corbyn says UN experts have been saying for years the Saudi coalition has been violating international law in Yemen. The government says there can only be a political solution. So why is it putting more arms into the region. May says the the only resolution will come from a diplomatic solution. That is why the government is working for one. Jeremy Corbyn says climate change campaigners are lobbying MPs today. This parliament was the first in the world to declare a climate emergency he says (after backing a Labour motion). He says he welcomes the court of appeal judgment last Thursday about arms sales to Saudia Arabia. Does the PM dispute the court\u2019s finding? May says the UK has one of the most robust arms sales regimes in the world. She says the government is disappointed the court found against the government on one ground, and it will be seeking permission to appeal. Corbyn says Germany and Denmark have both banned armed sales to Saudi Arabia. Does May think there are serious, ongoing violations of international law by Saudia Arabia in Yemen. May says the government considers these issues very carefully when considering arms sales. But there needs to be a peace settlement in Yemen. She says the Saudia Arabian intervention came in response to the legitimate government of Yemen. May says discussions are continuing about a different approach to localism in Yorkshire. Labour\u2019s Thangam Debbonaire asks if May thinks the new PM should pass an environment and climate change bill to make the world a more beautiful place. May says the government already has introduced an environment bill. But why is Labour in the Lords trying to block the net zero carbon emissions target. Theresa May starts by wishing the England football team good luck against Norway this morning. And she says she hosted a reception this morning for armed forces reserves day, and Saturday is armed forces day, she says. Later today she will travel to Japan for the G20 summit, where global challenges like climate change and the threat to peace in the Gulf will be discussed. From the Press and Journal\u2019s Dan O\u2019Donoghue Theresa May has only five more PMQs left. Today\u2019s is starting very soon. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. And here is Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leadership contest, mocking the favourite in the Tory contest ... Boris Johnson is inviting people to give him a call on Monday night. Doubtless there will be plenty of journalists trying to get through ... The BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley has been tweeting from a hustings for Westminster\u2019s other leadership contest - the Lib Dem one, feature Jo Swinson and Sir Ed Davey. The population of the UK has risen to 66.4m but the growth rate has stalled, the Press Association reports. The latest calculations reveal there was an estimated 66,436,000 people living in the country at the end of June last year, according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). But the growth rate remained the same as the previous year. Over the 12 months to the middle of 2018, the UK population rose year-on-year by 0.6%, with the annual growth rate remaining slower than any year since mid-2004. Here is Alberto Nardelli, BuzzFeed\u2019s Europe editor, on Steve Baker\u2019s article 24 tweet. (See 10.40am.) At the Commons Treasury committee Labour\u2019s Wes Streeting asked Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, to respond to what Boris Johnson said about him in his LBC interview yesterday. Johnson appeared to criticise Carney\u2019s understanding of the article 24 process - before admitting Carney might not have said what he implied he did. Carney started by pointing out that Johnson clarified his initial comment yesterday saying Carney was wrong. Then he went on: I did not say that there needed to be the withdrawal agreement for Gatt 24 to apply. I said there needed to be an agreement ... When I was asked about it, it was \u2018Could you unilaterally use Gatt 24?\u2019 And the answer was no, you can\u2019t unilaterally use Gatt 24. There has to an agreement ... some form of agreement between the two parties that you are working towards a free trade or customs union agreement, something along that spectrum, and that has to be credible enough to the other members of the WTO [World Trade Organisation] that that is indeed the case ... Just to be clear, it gets into questions of semantics and precise language. But if one is asked can you have no-deal and Gatt 24 - well, an agreement is a form of deal, an agreement to use Gatt 24, at least in my understanding of the English language ... So there needs to be some form of agreement, and intention, and a credible intention to move towards a free trade or customs union. This is from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand, who has been watching the Mark Carney hearing. I will post the full quote shortly. The Tory MP Marcus Fysh, a Brexiter who is backing Boris Johnson for the leadership, has posted a Twitter thread about the Gatt article 24 debate. It starts here. As mentioned earlier, what is at issue is not so much what article 24 says, which is verifiable, but whether the EU would be willing to use it, which is a matter for political judgment. This is what Fysh says on this issue. Steve Baker, the Tory Brexiter and deputy chairman of the European Research Group, which represents Conservative MPs pushing for a harder Brexit, has accused Liam Fox of \u201ctilting at windmills\u201d in his overnight LinkedIn article (see 9.23am) - ie, misrepresenting Brexiter arguments about the potential of Gatt article 24. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has just started giving evidence to the Commons Treasury committee. My colleague Graeme Wearden is covering it here. As the Independent reports, Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said in a speech last night that a Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership could be an \u201copportunity for disaster\u201d. He said: Boris has placed at the very centre of his campaign the commitment that we will leave the EU on 31 October, deal or no deal. This a complete hostage to fortune. At the same parliament has been clear, rightly in my view, that it will not countenance leaving the EU without a deal. It is always a good maxim in politics not to enter a room unless you know that you can get out of it. Boris Johnson has not only entered the room but he has put on the straitjacket, padlocked the door and started the tap running. Kerslake said Johnson was \u201cgood to work with\u201d when they worked on housing issues together when Johnson was mayor of London. But he recalled Johnson cracking a joke about how \u201cOut of every disaster comes an opportunity - or in my case an opportunity for another disaster.\u201d Kerslake went on: \u201cBoris as PM may just be another opportunity for disaster.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn wants to back a second EU referendum but some of his inner circle seem to want Brexit to be carried out no matter what, Labour\u2019s Margaret Beckett has said. As my colleague Rowena Mason and Jessica Elgot report, Beckett, a former foreign secretary who is campaigning for a second referendum, told the Today programme she thought the Labour leader was open to the idea but some of his closest advisers were preventing him from budging and would be prepared to allow a no-deal Brexit. Beckett said: I don\u2019t get the impression that Jeremy himself is the stumbling block. There are people very close with great influence on him who are passionately opposed to it \u2026 and he wants to keep the party together as much as possible. Unfortunately, it\u2019s looking more and more that some of the people who he wants to accept the majority view are not just expressing reservations but completely oppose, and I\u2019m beginning to think some of them do actually want Britain to leave no matter what and they don\u2019t give a toss. Here is Rowena and Jessica\u2019s full story. Yesterday the German ambassador to UK, Peter Wittig, said his government would \u201ctalk to the last hour\u201d to avoid a no-deal Brexit. He has also written a 1,500 word article in Handelsblatt which will be seen as a plea to the UK not to crash out of the EU on 31 October. In the piece he: Warns that a free trade agreement after a no-deal Brexit would be \u201cenormously difficult\u201d. Advocates a deal with \u201cmore than a conventional\u201d third country special relationship between Britain and EU. Talks of the need for a continuing close military relationship. Says all countries must ask what their global status will be in 10, 15 years. Wittig says: Negotiating a free trade agreement after a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit would be enormously difficult. The UK\u2019s obligations under the withdrawal agreement would remain unresolved, trust would be destroyed. We would not be able to return to the agenda immediately ... Short-term considerations must not prevail. We have to preserve the strategic view of Europe in the world: where will Europe stand in 10, 15, 20 years? Where do we want Europe to stand? Will the EU still play a role on the global map in a world dominated by the US and China: politically, economically, technologically, militarily? If we Europeans want to continue to sit at the table of the global powers of design in the future, we must join forces - also and especially in the case of Brexit. It is in the pan-European interest to keep Britain as the fifth largest economy in the world and - with France - Europe\u2019s leading military power with veto power in the Security Council in joint orbit. This requires a high level of vision from all. The United Kingdom legally becomes a so-called \u201cthird country\u201d as of the date of withdrawal. But we need more than a conventional third state relationship. We need a partnership of our own kind that is as close as possible, hence a new \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the EU and the UK. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, has been tweeting this letter published in the Daily Telegraph implying that Gatt article 24 could be used quite easily to allow tariff-free trade to continue after a no-deal Brexit. In fact, if you read the letter closely, you will see that what it is saying about how Gatt article 24 works is much the same as what Liam Fox is saying in his LinkedIn article. (See 9.23am.) The difference between the two sides lies in their assessment of the EU\u2019s willingness to use this mechanism. Fox is arguing that, in the event of the UK and the EU failing to negotiate a withdrawal agreement, there is no prospect of the EU saying that, actually, they have agreed in principle to conclude a free trade deal in the future. But Cash seems to think this would be an option. In his article Fox also says that article 24 would not be a panacea anyway because it only covers tariffs. It does not cover \u201cmore complex behind the border regulatory issues affecting trade\u201d, he says. Boris Johnson would be able to ignore parliament\u2019s efforts to stop a no-deal Brexit and blame the EU if it refuses to give the UK a better deal, Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, has said. As my colleagues Rowena Mason and Matthew Weaver report, Raab, who is now backing Johnson for the Tory leadership, told the Today programme that any motion from MPs against a no-deal Brexit would have \u201czero legal effect\u201d and could be overridden. But Rory Stewart, the international development secretary who is now backing Jeremy Hunt for the leadership, told the same programme that parliament had not exhausted all options to prevent no deal. He said: Parliament is against no deal. It is only the legal default because parliament made it the legal default. Parliament can unmake it the legal default. There are many, many opportunities in legislation that have to brought forward, that could be amended in order to stop a no-deal Brexit. Here is our full write-up of the Raab and Stewart interviews. At one stage in his TalkRadio interview yesterday Boris Johnson described his Brexit strategy as a set of three preferences, with plan A as his preference, plan B as his fallback, and plan C as the fallback to the fallback. Charlie Cooper sums them up well in the Politico Europe London Playbook briefing this morning. Plan A: A deal with the EU replacing the Northern Ireland backstop aspect of May\u2019s withdrawal agreement with \u201calternative arrangements\u201d that will be brought up to speed during a standstill transition period much like the one agreed by May. NB: The EU has said repeatedly the withdrawal agreement is not up for renegotiation. Plan B: If (when?) the EU says no, seek agreement from Brussels for a standstill on tariff rates under article 24 of the World Trade Organisation\u2019s general agreement on tariffs and trade (sigh) while the two sides work towards a free trade agreement. Plan C: If this fails, no deal on October 31 with full tariffs on Day 1, with only those preparations and parachute arrangements unilaterally planned by the U.K and the EU in place. Throughout, the \u00a339bn divorce payment agreed by May will be withheld till Johnson is satisfied by the EU\u2019s commitments on trade. Given that plan A is almost certainly impossible - even if the EU was willing to negotiate a new withdrawal agreement, which it says it isn\u2019t, almost no one thinks that such a deal could be signed and legislated for in the UK before 31 October - there is increased focus on plan B. Yesterday Johnson scaled down his assertions about the potential of article 24, accepting that the UK could not use it unilaterally, but still claiming it was a viable means of keeping EU-UK trade tariff fee in the event of there being no deal. But, overnight, Liam Fox, the international trade secretary has pitched in, using an article to effectively accuse Johnson of of peddling \u201csupposition\u201d not fact on this point. Fox is supporting Jeremy Hunt for the Tory leadership. But he is also a hardline Brexiter, whose instinctive Brexit views are much closer to Johnson\u2019s than Hunt. And, given his cabinet job, he is also the one minister who ought to know what he is talking about on the matter of Gatt. Here is LinkedIn article. And here is an extract: Some commentators have suggested that, in a \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario, the UK could maintain its existing trading relationship with the European Union for up to ten years by claiming exemption from the WTO\u2019s rules, under article XXIV:5 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (Gatt). This is not the case. Gatt article XXIV permits the establishment of free trade agreements and customs unions as an exception to the \u2018most favoured nation\u2019 principle at the WTO - namely, that WTO members cannot give preferential treatment to products and services originating from one trading partner over others. However, in order to benefit from the terms of article XXIV, there must be an agreement between two WTO members as to the elimination of duties and other restrictive regulations on substantially all trade. Therefore, article XXIV would not, by itself, allow the UK to maintain tariff-free trade with the EU in the absence of a negotiated agreement ... A \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario, by definition, suggests that there would be no mutual agreement between the UK and the EU on any temporary or permanent arrangement. In those circumstances article XXIV cannot be used. The European Union has made it clear on a number of occasions that full tariffs will be applied to the United Kingdom in the event of \u2018no-deal\u2019. The director-general of the WTO, Roberto Azevedo, has also confirmed there must be a bilateral agreement between the EU and the UK in order to claim an implementation period under Gatt article XXIV. \u201cOnce they have an agreement I think article XXIV could give them some time for implementation of that agreement,\u201d he told Bloomberg. \u201cBut the first question is the agreement itself\u201d ... It is important that public debate on this topic is conducted on the basis of fact rather than supposition, so that we are able to make decisions in the best interests of our country. We will doubtless hear much more on this today, including from Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, who is giving evidence to MPs. At one point yesterday Johnson said that Carney was wrong about Gatt - before he retracted and accepted (correctly) that Carney might not have said what Johnson thought he had said. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, gives a speech to the Telegraph\u2019s future of trade and export forum. 10am: Damian Hinds, the education secretary, gives evidence to the Commons education committee. 10am: Jo Swinson and Sir Ed Davey take part in a Lib Dem leadership hustings in the Commons. 10.15am: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 12pm: Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, speaks at a Policy Exchange event on the backstop. Afternoon: Theresa May gives a speech on housing in Manchester. 3pm: Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, gives evidence to the Commons international development committee. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on the Tory leadership contest. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Conservative MPs implacably opposed to a no-deal Brexit will try to amend government legislation as early as next week as a way of binding the hands of Boris Johnson. A cross-party group is planning another attempt to stop a no-deal Brexit after becoming increasingly alarmed at the tone of Johnson\u2019s pledges to take Britain out of the European Union on 31 October, \u201cdo or die\u201d. They are planning with Labour and other opposition parties to pass an amendment that would rule out leaving without a deal \u2013 or at least offer MPs the opportunity of a vote before that happened. Under one plan, they will try to change the parliamentary estimates bill that comes before the House of Commons as early as next Tuesday, with an amendment to prevent a no-deal Brexit put down in the names of Tory MP Dominic Grieve and Labour MP Margaret Beckett. It would stop the government being able to consume resources and spend cash if it pursued a no-deal Brexit policy. Another is the possibility of amending some likely emergency government legislation on Northern Ireland power-sharing, which may appear on Wednesday. The Guardian understands the government is considering introducing an emergency bill next week, to extend the powers civil servants have effectively to govern in Northern Ireland, while the power-sharing assembly continues to be suspended. Parliamentarians who have discussed the plan are concerned about whether an anti no-deal amendment would be ruled outside the scope of the legislation \u2013 but hope they will be aided by the willingness of the Speaker, John Bercow, to bend the rules. However, it is not yet certain to be brought forward. Bercow said in a speech in Washington last month: \u201cThe idea that parliament is going to \u2026 be evacuated from the centre-stage of the debate on Brexit is unimaginable. It is simply unimaginable.\u201d Labour narrowly failed in a recent bid to commandeer the parliamentary timetable for a day, to pave the way for a bid to stop a no-deal Brexit. But a plan led by Conservative backbenchers might have more hope of securing the support of Tory rebels, than one initiated by Jeremy Corbyn and the other opposition leaders. Passing an amendment would also be a less drastic option than voting to bring down the government. Several Conservative MPs, including Ken Clarke and Grieve, have said publicly in recent days that they would consider supporting Labour in a motion of no confidence against the government, if they believed a no-deal Brexit was imminent. Their fears have been raised by increasingly hard Brexit rhetoric from Johnson, who has the backing of key figures in the European Research Group (ERG), which is urging him to deliver Brexit by Halloween, even if that means leaving without a deal. Corbyn has not ruled out tabling a no-confidence vote in the narrow window between the new prime minister being appointed, on Wednesday 24 July, and the House of Commons rising for its summer recess the next day. The Labour leader\u2019s spokesman said on Wednesday they would table such a motion when they believe it has the most chance of success. Supporting Labour in bringing down the government would be a dramatic decision for Conservative MPs, however, who would thereby effectively be resigning from their party. Under the Fixed-Term Parliament Act, if the government loses a formal motion of no confidence, there is then a fortnight-long period in which alternative candidates can try to assemble a governing majority. If they fail to do so, a general election is triggered. Liberal Democrat leadership candidate Ed Davey has suggested a government of national unity could emerge in those 14 days, perhaps led by a Labour backbencher such as Yvette Cooper or Hilary Benn. Philip Lee, a backbench Conservative MP, told the BBC\u2019s World at One that pro-European Conservatives like himself had to be as \u201cruthless\u201d as the ERG as they seek to stop a no-deal Brexit, which was why they had to keep open the option of voting against the government on a no confidence motion to prevent a no-deal Brexit. \u201cNobody wants to vote no confidence in the government, nobody seeks to do that \u2026 but ultimately if we believe truly that no-deal is unacceptable without the explicit consent of the public, then we have to leave everything on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve watched as the ERG have essentially won through here, and have dictated terms, and they have done this, successfully I might add, by being ruthless and having a clear strategy throughout. \u201cAnd it\u2019s about time those of us who hold the belief that a no-deal on these terms is an unacceptable thing to be contemplating that we also adopt exactly the same approach that the ERG have successfully undertaken in the last 12 months.\u201d",

It\u2019s the greatest job I\u2019ve ever had in government. It\u2019s an amazing department that makes a huge difference around the world. And it\u2019s greatly admired. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked with the Department for International Development in Iraq, Afghanistan going back over 15, 16 years. It really was the dream of my career, but unfortunately we will have to see who the next prime minister is.\u201d</p> <p>The former prisons minister, who had worked previously at DfID before he took over from Penny Mordaunt last month, said Johnson\u2019s stance on Europe would make it impossible to stay. Stewart, who has backed Johnson\u2019s rival Jeremy Hunt in the Conservative leadership contest, warned that a no-deal Brexit would make it harder for Britain to attain UN targets to lift people out of poverty.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, I wouldn\u2019t be able to remain in this job if Boris was prime minister,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cI don\u2019t think we he would want me, for a start, but it\u2019s also true that I\u2019m afraid on the very fundamental issue of the day, which is Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cI have said repeatedly that he is trying to deliver something that he can\u2019t deliver and he\u2019s going to disappoint people deeply. I wouldn\u2019t be able to be a member of a cabinet arguing for a policy that I think is misleading.\u201d</p> <p>Stewart was at Torriano primary school in Camden, north London, to face questions from schoolchildren and to talk about the UK\u2019s progress towards the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/sustainable-development-goals\">UN\u2019s global goals</a>. A <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uks-voluntary-national-review-of-the-sustainable-development-goals\">DfID review</a> said that while Britain has made \u201csignificant strides\u201d on the targets, much remained to be done \u2013&nbsp;particularly on the key UK priorities of reducing poverty and ensuring \u201cno one is left behind\u201d.</p> <p>Stewart said avoiding a no-deal Brexit was essential to achieving these goals. Asked how the government could better achieve its aim to reduce poverty, he said:\u201cFrom my point of view, we have to avoid a no-deal Brexit. It sounds like a daft thing to say, but I think the economic damage it would do would reduce the amount of money that we have available. If we can deliver a sensible solution to Brexit there should be \u00a326m or \u00a327m more available, and I would like to see that invested firstly in education, and we should put more into policing and the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>The international development secretary, who pledged to put the climate crisis and the environment at DfID\u2019s heart, said the world was at risk of becoming \u201cmuch more difficult and unpleasant\u201d within 50 years without sweeping changes in sustainability.</p> <p>Stewart said he expected Johnson to retain the 0.7% target of gross national income for overseas aid, and hoped DfID would remain a standalone department despite Johnson\u2019s previous suggestions that it should be brought into the Foreign Office.</p> <p>\u201cMy understanding is that Boris is committed to keeping 0.7% and that\u2019s really important, because there were candidates in this race that were trying to get rid of 0.7%. That is central, partly because climate and the environment is something that is so intermeshed in the way we think about development and poverty, and the scale of the challenge we\u2019re facing on climate and the environment is literally multiple trillions of pounds.\u201d</p> <p>Esther McVey, an early leadership candidate, has suggested the 0.7% target should be cut.</p> <p>Stewart said that he felt close co-ordination between DfID and the Foreign Office would help in conflict zones like Somalia and South Sudan, but added: \u201cI would definitely want DfID to be a standalone department. It\u2019s also an achievement we have put into law and I would hope that whichever leader keeps this.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jun/26/illegal-drugs-classifications-based-on-politics-not-science-cannabis-report-says\">Illegal drug classifications are based on politics not science \u2013 report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During a tour of the school, which banned single-use plastic two years ago, Jonah, 11, asked Stewart about introducing a charge for bottles similar to the one introduced for plastic bags. Stewart replied: \u201cPlastic bottles I think would be a great opportunity and so would plastic coffee mugs\u201d.</p> <p>Stewart suggested that a charge of 1p for every bag of mixed waste would lead to more people recycling. </p> <p>He said if he \u201creally had money to spend\u201d, he would put \u00a31bn of research and development into universities to work on technology.</p> <p>\u201cIf you could develop light spectrum technology or solar film technology so the next time China builds a power generation station, instead of building it powered by coal, they built it, powered it by solar, that would probably make a bigger difference than almost anything else we did,\u201d he told pupils.</p>",

Stewart, who has backed Johnson\u2019s rival Jeremy Hunt in the Conservative leadership contest, warned that a no-deal Brexit would make it harder for Britain to attain UN targets to lift people out of poverty. \u201cUnfortunately, I wouldn\u2019t be able to remain in this job if Boris was prime minister,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cI don\u2019t think we he would want me, for a start, but it\u2019s also true that I\u2019m afraid on the very fundamental issue of the day, which is Brexit. \u201cI have said repeatedly that he is trying to deliver something that he can\u2019t deliver and he\u2019s going to disappoint people deeply. I wouldn\u2019t be able to be a member of a cabinet arguing for a policy that I think is misleading.\u201d Stewart was at Torriano primary school in Camden, north London, to face questions from schoolchildren and to talk about the UK\u2019s progress towards the UN\u2019s global goals. A DfID review said that while Britain has made \u201csignificant strides\u201d on the targets, much remained to be done \u2013 particularly on the key UK priorities of reducing poverty and ensuring \u201cno one is left behind\u201d. Stewart said avoiding a no-deal Brexit was essential to achieving these goals. Asked how the government could better achieve its aim to reduce poverty, he said:\u201cFrom my point of view, we have to avoid a no-deal Brexit. It sounds like a daft thing to say, but I think the economic damage it would do would reduce the amount of money that we have available. If we can deliver a sensible solution to Brexit there should be \u00a326m or \u00a327m more available, and I would like to see that invested firstly in education, and we should put more into policing and the NHS.\u201d The international development secretary, who pledged to put the climate crisis and the environment at DfID\u2019s heart, said the world was at risk of becoming \u201cmuch more difficult and unpleasant\u201d within 50 years without sweeping changes in sustainability. Stewart said he expected Johnson to retain the 0.7% target of gross national income for overseas aid, and hoped DfID would remain a standalone department despite Johnson\u2019s previous suggestions that it should be brought into the Foreign Office. \u201cMy understanding is that Boris is committed to keeping 0.7% and that\u2019s really important, because there were candidates in this race that were trying to get rid of 0.7%. That is central, partly because climate and the environment is something that is so intermeshed in the way we think about development and poverty, and the scale of the challenge we\u2019re facing on climate and the environment is literally multiple trillions of pounds.\u201d Esther McVey, an early leadership candidate, has suggested the 0.7% target should be cut. Stewart said that he felt close co-ordination between DfID and the Foreign Office would help in conflict zones like Somalia and South Sudan, but added: \u201cI would definitely want DfID to be a standalone department. It\u2019s also an achievement we have put into law and I would hope that whichever leader keeps this.\u201d During a tour of the school, which banned single-use plastic two years ago, Jonah, 11, asked Stewart about introducing a charge for bottles similar to the one introduced for plastic bags. Stewart replied: \u201cPlastic bottles I think would be a great opportunity and so would plastic coffee mugs\u201d. Stewart suggested that a charge of 1p for every bag of mixed waste would lead to more people recycling. He said if he \u201creally had money to spend\u201d, he would put \u00a31bn of research and development into universities to work on technology. \u201cIf you could develop light spectrum technology or solar film technology so the next time China builds a power generation station, instead of building it powered by coal, they built it, powered it by solar, that would probably make a bigger difference than almost anything else we did,\u201d he told pupils.",

Using data from 2005 to 2017 they suggest the Brexit vote was related to a long-term class and geographical realignment but did not cause it. If Brexit acts as a proxy for this emerging divide, then simply choosing sides based around an immediate political calculation might trigger epic, unforeseen consequences for Labour. Indeed, some are using the issue to rethink the very nature of the left.</p> <p>Traditionally, the left\u2019s \u201cbase\u201d was the working class. For Marx, it was \u201cthe class to which the future belongs\u201d.</p> <p>Yet recently both the social-democratic and radical left have sought to assert a new progressive \u201cbase\u201d A leading advocate of this historic rethink, Paul Mason, <a href=\"https://medium.com/mosquito-ridge/labour-the-way-ahead-78d49d513a9f\" title=\"\">recently suggested</a> that \u201ca new strategy must be based on the realisation that Labour\u2019s heartland is now in the big cities, among the salariat and among the globally oriented, educated part of the workforce\u201d. He identifies this as the \u201cnew core of the Labour project\u201d, a distance away from the classical left proletariat. The new \u201cbase\u201d is to be formed around \u201cnetworked individuals\u201dresiding in \u201cRemainia\u201d.</p> <p>The argument is that Labour should ditch a sentimental attachment to the notion of a working class based in traditional heartlands; one that electorally offers diminishing returns. The party also suffers from a serious problem of attrition among older voters. The best electoral strategy is to therefore build a future coalition around younger remain voters; a renewal that goes far beyond the repeated search for the \u201cformer Labour voter\u201d. There exists a radical new Labour-supporting cultural demographic and a new political geography reflected in the referendum result. Labour should hold its nerve and accept casualties in its traditional seats as we transition towards our new remain heartlands, safe in the knowledge that the working class is dying and increasingly doesn\u2019t vote for us anyway.</p> <p>For advocates of this position, two key drivers are rewiring progressive politics. First, for 20 years or more, there was much talk of \u201cfreedom\u2019s children\u201d, who would entrench a new modernity in the era of globalisation. Parochial attachments were being dissolved, replaced with a radical individualism and strengthened democracy, especially among the more educated and the young. The future would see the desire for \u201cworld citizenship\u201d and global political action triumph. The future lay among the post-national, urban, networked, educated youth.</p> <p>Those on the radical left pronounced the nation dead, given the amorphous power of capital whose modern rule suggested a declining relevance attached to questions of territory and country. For today\u2019s left this has brought forward the political possibilities offered by a transnational multitude to challenge global capital \u2013 a radical new form of political agency. The global, urban networked youth have replaced the workers.</p> <p>Second, the working class is described as being destroyed through automation, leading to an embrace of <a href=\"https://krisis.eu/workerism/\" title=\"\">\u201cpost-workerism\u201d</a> and a backing of universal basic income. While future prosperity will be driven by the production of knowledge and intangible assets, the working class, old Labour and the foundations of leftwing thinking are disintegrating. This argument has reappeared today on the radical left with a very specific, optimistic reading whereby technological change destroys the working class and takes us to a vaguely defined place called \u201cpost-capitalism\u201d. This political reorientation privileges the urban sites of knowledge work as the means of left advancement. Urban youth is the new left change agent to confront capital. \u201cNetworked youth\u201d is destroying capitalism as the information economy is incompatible with the market economy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/labour-holds-back-on-second-referendum-amid-shadow-cabinet-rift\">Labour holds back on second referendum amid shadow cabinet rift</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a result of this debate, in Labour today it is increasingly difficult to disentangle the politics around a second referendum \u2013 which would divide the party\u2019s leave voters from its remainers \u2013 from a conscious strategy to separate progressive politics from the economic emancipation of the traditional working class. Much fashionable thinking tends to neglect the significant role work plays in our lives. It remains a source of dignity and belonging; of overall human wellbeing. Moreover, there are real difficulties with a politics that embraces a global network rather than being anchored around more parochial concerns of place, community and nation. These issues underlie the Brexit challenges the party now faces.</p> <p>Labour is in danger of privileging certain sections of the electorate at the expense of others. It is very difficult to see how, having redefined the base of the left into such restricted demographic groups, it might create the necessary alliances across classes and geographical settings to gain and retain power. Talk of the \u201cmany not the few\u201d cannot cover this up for long.</p> <p>\u2022 Jon Cruddas is Labour MP for Dagenham and Rainham</p>",

Second, the working class is described as being destroyed through automation, leading to an embrace of \u201cpost-workerism\u201d and a backing of universal basic income. While future prosperity will be driven by the production of knowledge and intangible assets, the working class, old Labour and the foundations of leftwing thinking are disintegrating. This argument has reappeared today on the radical left with a very specific, optimistic reading whereby technological change destroys the working class and takes us to a vaguely defined place called \u201cpost-capitalism\u201d. This political reorientation privileges the urban sites of knowledge work as the means of left advancement. Urban youth is the new left change agent to confront capital. \u201cNetworked youth\u201d is destroying capitalism as the information economy is incompatible with the market economy. As a result of this debate, in Labour today it is increasingly difficult to disentangle the politics around a second referendum \u2013 which would divide the party\u2019s leave voters from its remainers \u2013 from a conscious strategy to separate progressive politics from the economic emancipation of the traditional working class. Much fashionable thinking tends to neglect the significant role work plays in our lives. It remains a source of dignity and belonging; of overall human wellbeing. Moreover, there are real difficulties with a politics that embraces a global network rather than being anchored around more parochial concerns of place, community and nation. These issues underlie the Brexit challenges the party now faces. Labour is in danger of privileging certain sections of the electorate at the expense of others. It is very difficult to see how, having redefined the base of the left into such restricted demographic groups, it might create the necessary alliances across classes and geographical settings to gain and retain power. Talk of the \u201cmany not the few\u201d cannot cover this up for long. \u2022 Jon Cruddas is Labour MP for Dagenham and Rainham",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods. This has also been referred to by government ministers as an \"Australia-style deal\". Australia does not have a free trade agreement with the EU.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>To gauge the impact of Brexit on a monthly basis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/26/how-has-brexit-vote-affected-the-uk-economy-june-verdict\">the Guardian monitors eight economic indicators</a>, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100.</p> \n<p>Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in three cases the outcome was worse than expected.

As the Conservative leadership race reaches an acrimonious finale, the sugar hit for the economy from the stockpiling rush before the original Brexit deadline has run its course, with warning signs emerging that growth will flatline. The prospect of Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt allowing the country to walk away without a withdrawal agreement in place on 31 October has alarmed business groups and has put renewed pressure on the pound. Johnson has made clear that he will use the nuclear option if necessary, in a move observers warn could crash the economy into recession.

Sterling had fallen sharply to less than $1.26 against the US dollar and to about \u20ac1.12 against the euro. However, the US Federal Reserve coming closer to being forced into cutting interest rates amid fears over a slowing US economy has dampened the strength of the dollar in the past week. This has helped to inflate the value of the pound. The outgoing head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, also suggested that the eurozone requires more economic stimulus, which has sapped the strength of the euro.</p> \n<h2>Stock markets surge amid stimulus talk</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"ftse100\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;ftse100&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"ftse250\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;ftse250&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Mario Draghi using one of his final speeches as ECB president to suggest that interest rates in the eurozone may need to be cut further has helped European equities power ahead over the past month. Increased stimulus can help the stock market to rise, as companies\u2019 borrowing costs are cut. Investors have also become more positive about the chances of a resolution in the US-China trade dispute, after a prolonged period of concern over the standoff between Washington and Beijing. Although rate cuts from the US Fed could suggest a weakening economy, the prospect of stimulus from the US central bank has also lifted markets.</p> \n<h2>Meets forecast</h2> \n<h2>Car price war and air fares cool inflation</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"cpi\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;cpi&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>UK inflation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/19/car-price-war-and-falling-airfares-cool-uk-inflation\">fell for the first time in four months</a>, dropping back down to the target set by the government for consumer prices inflation of 2%, fuelled by a price war in the car industry and cheaper air fares. Economists said the slower annual increase in the cost of an airline ticket in May when compared with April was mainly due to the timing of Easter, when prices are jacked up around the public holiday. The drop in inflation is likely to offer households some much-needed respite after inflation spiked after the EU referendum, as the drop in the value of the pound pushed up the cost of imports to Britain.</p> \n<h2>Better than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Brexit stockpiling narrows trade deficit</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"trade\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;trade&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>After ballooning as companies rushed to import goods to avoid Brexit disruption, the UK\u2019s trade deficit \u2013 the shortfall between imports and exports \u2013 narrowed to \u00a32.7bn in April from \u00a36.1bn in March. Although suggesting that import and export volumes may be returning to normal, economists said the latest figures could indicate that firms in both the UK and on the continent now have unusually high levels of inventory, meaning they do not need to trade as much as would normally be the case. Export demand has also suffered in recent months amid a broader slowdown in the global economy due to the US-China trade dispute.</p> \n<h2>Worse than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Business surveys paint weak growth picture</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"pmi\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;pmi&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Surveys of business activity used as early warning signals for the British economy by the Bank of England and the Treasury suggested that UK economic growth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/05/uk-economy-is-stalling-despite-service-sector-growth\">remained weak last month</a>. The latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply showed that service sector activity, which accounts for four-fifths of the economy, strengthened in May, despite manufacturing and construction slumping into contraction amid heightened levels of uncertainty over Brexit. The IHS Markit/Cips services purchasing managers rose to a three-month high of 51 from 50.4 in April, following a rise in domestic orders. A figure above 50 indicates growth.

      "bodyText": "Mounting no-deal Brexit fears hit sterling The rising likelihood of no-deal Brexit has dragged down the pound on the foreign exchanges over the past month, as the prospect of a no-deal-focused Boris Johnson as prime minister becomes more likely. Sterling had fallen sharply to less than $1.26 against the US dollar and to about \u20ac1.12 against the euro. However, the US Federal Reserve coming closer to being forced into cutting interest rates amid fears over a slowing US economy has dampened the strength of the dollar in the past week. This has helped to inflate the value of the pound. The outgoing head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, also suggested that the eurozone requires more economic stimulus, which has sapped the strength of the euro. Stock markets surge amid stimulus talk Mario Draghi using one of his final speeches as ECB president to suggest that interest rates in the eurozone may need to be cut further has helped European equities power ahead over the past month. Increased stimulus can help the stock market to rise, as companies\u2019 borrowing costs are cut. Investors have also become more positive about the chances of a resolution in the US-China trade dispute, after a prolonged period of concern over the standoff between Washington and Beijing. Although rate cuts from the US Fed could suggest a weakening economy, the prospect of stimulus from the US central bank has also lifted markets. Meets forecast Car price war and air fares cool inflation UK inflation fell for the first time in four months, dropping back down to the target set by the government for consumer prices inflation of 2%, fuelled by a price war in the car industry and cheaper air fares. Economists said the slower annual increase in the cost of an airline ticket in May when compared with April was mainly due to the timing of Easter, when prices are jacked up around the public holiday. The drop in inflation is likely to offer households some much-needed respite after inflation spiked after the EU referendum, as the drop in the value of the pound pushed up the cost of imports to Britain. Better than forecast Brexit stockpiling narrows trade deficit After ballooning as companies rushed to import goods to avoid Brexit disruption, the UK\u2019s trade deficit \u2013 the shortfall between imports and exports \u2013 narrowed to \u00a32.7bn in April from \u00a36.1bn in March. Although suggesting that import and export volumes may be returning to normal, economists said the latest figures could indicate that firms in both the UK and on the continent now have unusually high levels of inventory, meaning they do not need to trade as much as would normally be the case. Export demand has also suffered in recent months amid a broader slowdown in the global economy due to the US-China trade dispute. Worse than forecast Business surveys paint weak growth picture Surveys of business activity used as early warning signals for the British economy by the Bank of England and the Treasury suggested that UK economic growth remained weak last month. The latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply showed that service sector activity, which accounts for four-fifths of the economy, strengthened in May, despite manufacturing and construction slumping into contraction amid heightened levels of uncertainty over Brexit. The IHS Markit/Cips services purchasing managers rose to a three-month high of 51 from 50.4 in April, following a rise in domestic orders. A figure above 50 indicates growth. Still, economists warned the pattern of growth remained close to stalling point. Better than forecast Jobs growth slows amid Brexit uncertainty After months of employers appearing to shrug off Brexit concerns, jobs growth slowed in the three months to April. Employment in Britain increased by 32,000 to reach a record high of 32.75m, according to the ONS, significantly down on the 99,000 jobs added to the workforce in March. Driven by rising self-employment and women entering work, economists said the weak gains suggested that companies were becoming jittery about Brexit.

Total average pay including bonuses rose by 3.1%, down from 3.3% in March, but beating economists\u2019 forecasts for growth of 3%. Worse than forecast Cold weather in May damages retail sales An unseasonably cold May prompted a sharp decline in summer clothing sales last month, raising fears over the strength of the economy as consumers reined in their spending.
