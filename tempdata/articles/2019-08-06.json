Of the UK\u2019s 73 seats, 27 were due to be redistributed among 14 under-represented countries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/05/no-deal-brexit-is-boris-johnsons-central-scenario-eu-told\">Boris Johnson has no intention of renegotiating Brexit deal, EU told</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Slovakia was to take one of those, increasing the country\u2019s share of MEPs to 14. Lexmann, a candidate for the Slovakian Christian Democratic Movement, emerged from the European elections in May as the person to take that place.</p> <p>But the Brits have not left \u2013 and Lexmann, like the others, has been left in limbo, watching on anxiously from across Europe as the Brexit debate in the UK decides their future. The unlucky 27 have been nicknamed Europe\u2019s \u201cghost MEPs\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a horrible feeling, and it still is,\u201d Lexmann said.</p> <p>To campaign in the European elections, Lexmann went on unpaid leave from her job as director of the EU office of the International Republican Institute, a US NGO working in democratic development. But when she was elected, the Slovakian state formally named her as an MEP, a political status that prevents her from returning to work in her politically neutral organisation.</p> <p>She has had to move to Bratislava from her home in Brussels, and is still without a salary.</p> <p>The situation is all the more frustrating as Lexmann and lawyers argue that it is only due to a badly drafted constitutional amendment that her party was left with the unwanted Brexit MEP seat rather than a less well-supported rival. They are looking to take their case to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg.</p> <p>The remarkable fact is that, as with many of the reserve MEPs, Lexmann still cannot bring herself to want the British to go.</p> <p>\u201cI was always against Brexit,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody was saying now you pray for Brexit, and I say I hope that I can have justice without Brexit. Why am I supposed to wish for something I don\u2019t want?\u201d</p> <p>Lexmann\u2019s reluctance to wish for an outcome that would provide her with salary and status highlights that the European debate on the continent can be misunderstood in the UK.

      "bodyText": "Miriam Lexmann has everything to gain from Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal, even though she cannot help but believe it is a disaster in the making. \u201cThe Slovak media call it the Lexmann paradox,\u201d she says. \u201cI am a paradox.\u201d Lexmann is one of a cadre of MEPs-in-waiting, taking no salary or expenses, standing by for the UK to finally leave the European Union so they may take up seats due to be relinquished by their British counterparts. In a post-Brexit world, the European parliament was to reduce in size from 751 to 705. Of the UK\u2019s 73 seats, 27 were due to be redistributed among 14 under-represented countries. Slovakia was to take one of those, increasing the country\u2019s share of MEPs to 14. Lexmann, a candidate for the Slovakian Christian Democratic Movement, emerged from the European elections in May as the person to take that place. But the Brits have not left \u2013 and Lexmann, like the others, has been left in limbo, watching on anxiously from across Europe as the Brexit debate in the UK decides their future. The unlucky 27 have been nicknamed Europe\u2019s \u201cghost MEPs\u201d. \u201cIt was a horrible feeling, and it still is,\u201d Lexmann said. To campaign in the European elections, Lexmann went on unpaid leave from her job as director of the EU office of the International Republican Institute, a US NGO working in democratic development. But when she was elected, the Slovakian state formally named her as an MEP, a political status that prevents her from returning to work in her politically neutral organisation. She has had to move to Bratislava from her home in Brussels, and is still without a salary. The situation is all the more frustrating as Lexmann and lawyers argue that it is only due to a badly drafted constitutional amendment that her party was left with the unwanted Brexit MEP seat rather than a less well-supported rival. They are looking to take their case to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. The remarkable fact is that, as with many of the reserve MEPs, Lexmann still cannot bring herself to want the British to go. \u201cI was always against Brexit,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody was saying now you pray for Brexit, and I say I hope that I can have justice without Brexit. Why am I supposed to wish for something I don\u2019t want?\u201d Lexmann\u2019s reluctance to wish for an outcome that would provide her with salary and status highlights that the European debate on the continent can be misunderstood in the UK. Many see the loss of Britain as a ballast against the more federalist forces, centralising power in Brussels, as a devastating blow, Lexmann said. \u201cI really fear for what is going to happen with Europe if there is no-deal Brexit,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want in my own head to prioritise my own interests because I kind of feel this will be disaster. And also as a possible future European parliamentarian, I don\u2019t like the EU pushing too much for federalism and too much Europe. \u201cFor me the Brits were balancing it out. And I am afraid how it will go without the Brits and that the French and Germans will take over.\u201d Elsewhere in Europe, Barry Andrews, a Fianna F\u00e1il MEP who is one of two Irish reserves, said he has found it a very difficult situation but would prefer Brexit to be stopped than to take his seat. Spanish MEP-in-reserve Adrian Vazquez Lazara is of a like mind, believing a better outcome for Europe should take precedence over his situation. Lexmann is closely watching events in the UK from Bratislava for clues as to what will happen next. \u201cIt is very much going to influence my life,\u201d she said. \u201cMany people told me when Boris Johnson was kind of elected \u2013 elected by the party to be prime minister \u2013 that now Brexit is certain. But then you see what the Scots are saying about independence. \u201cMaybe Johnson is also realising that he is risking too much, that he is risking the United Kingdom as a union? So there is a general election, a renegotiation? So that is another nine months or whatever without a job. I kind of think: how can this kind of thing happen?\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Early last week, for the briefest of moments, the tensions swirling around Scotland\u2019s relationship with England and the deepening UK crisis of Brexit were perfectly symbolised by Boris Johnson\u2019s arm.</p> <p>Amid the angry noise of a crowd of demonstrators, Johnson was on the steps of Bute House (the Edinburgh residence of the Scottish first minister) exchanging the usual opening pleasantries with Nicola Sturgeon for the benefit of photographers and TV crews. Then came the moment when everyone had to go inside \u2013 whereupon Johnson rather condescendingly extended one of his upper limbs, with a view to escorting Sturgeon into her own HQ. She appeared to say something, whereupon the arm went down and Johnson awkwardly walked in, a moment that inevitably went viral.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I said: \u2018Put your arm down,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThose kind of things happen in a flash. But I am aware that he was trying to do something that some people would describe as chivalrous and other people would say was a subconscious powerplay. I was kind of aware of him trying to \u2026 usher me in.\u201d She smiles. \u201cAnd I think, in the instant, I thought: \u2018That\u2019s inappropriate \u2013 you go in first.\u2019 But these things happen in a nanosecond. It wasn\u2019t at all deliberate on my part.\u201d</p> <p>One thing, however, was certain: she did not look happy. \u201cAgain, you\u2019ve got to remember that these photos are taken in an instant,\u201d she insists. \u201cBut, that said, I abhor what he is trying to do to the UK. And I abhor what the implications of that are for Scotland. So I don\u2019t think it will be surprising to anyone to hear me say that I wasn\u2019t absolutely thrilled to be welcoming Boris Johnson as prime minister.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"401759eab9075ffe398682be61ce0ed8390230d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/401759eab9075ffe398682be61ce0ed8390230d2/1010_774_1397_838/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I don\u2019t think I said: \u201cPut your arm down.\u201d\u2019 The incident outside Bute House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t think I said: \u201cPut your arm down.\u201d\u2019 The incident outside Bute House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before that meeting, they had crossed paths once before \u2013 at the VE Day celebrations immediately after the 2015 general election, at which Johnson brusquely asked Sturgeon if granting the Scottish government full control over its tax and spending powers would silence calls for independence. \u201cWe walked together through Horse Guards Parade. And I vividly remember, he said something like \u2013 and this is not a direct quote \u2013 \u2018What would buy you off? Would full fiscal autonomy buy you off?\u2019 I said: \u2018No, not really.\u2019\u201d She laughs.</p> <p>Four years on, she conveys a similar sense of Johnson reducing complex questions to breezy inanities. \u201cTalking to him, there\u2019s a sort of surreal element to it,\u201d she says. \u201cHe talks about Brexit, and a no-deal Brexit in particular, as if there is nothing to worry about, and anyone who says there is just being pessimistic and downbeat. I was very frank with him that I think it would be catastrophic, if it were allowed to happen. But, you know, then there\u2019s just a waving of the hands, and: \u2018No \u2013 it\u2019ll all be fine, and anyone who says otherwise is just indulging in doom and gloom.\u2019 I described it after the meeting as dangerous. \u2019Cos it <em>is</em> dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>One other aspect of Sturgeon\u2019s discussions with Johnson is fascinating. To <a href=\"https://www.holyrood.com/articles/inside-politics/smiling-assassin-interview-first-minister-nicola-sturgeon\" title=\"\">quote a profile</a> of her published a few years ago, Sturgeon is \u201cstate-educated, working-class, left-leaning and believably human\u201d. Johnson, who, by contrast, swaggered to where he is along a familiar path that passed through Eton and Oxford, has created his borderline absurd persona with the kind of chutzpah that tends to be the preserve of the truly posh. Class, I suggest, must have been a constant subtext in their exchanges.</p> <p>\u201cI do think there\u2019s an element of \u2026\u201d she pauses. \u201cWell, I said a moment ago that he talks what, in my view, is a load of nonsense, with utter conviction. And I do think there was an element of that sense of entitlement; the idea that you can make anybody believe anything if you say it in a particular way.\u201d</p> <p>Sturgeon became first minister in late 2014, taking over from Alex Salmond after the referendum on Scottish independence was won by the no campaign, but her party was still in the midst of its imperial phase; it would go on to win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats in the 2015 general election.</p> <p>She is one of those politicians whose voice and mannerisms seem instantly familiar: the precise, sometimes overlong, distinctly lawyerly sentences; the way that even her most speech-like utterances contain enough everyday humanity to keep you interested. Her humour, when it enters the conversation, gives a subtle sense of someone who appreciates the ridiculousness of politics, particularly at a time like this. But, unlike Johnson, she is also at pains to point out that Brexit is deadly serious, and that Britain faces \u201cthe most rightwing government we have had in my lifetime, probably including the Thatcher governments\u201d.</p> <p>We talk for an hour in one of Bute House\u2019s meeting rooms on the same day that the Bank of England is saying that there is a one in three chance of a Brexit recession, and Sky News has published a wad of civil service documents warning that a no-deal exit could trigger \u201cpotential consumer panic and food shortages\u201d, \u201coperational gaps\u201d in policing and national security, and \u201claw and order challenges\u201d in Northern Ireland. Given that the UK was meant to leave the EU on 29 March, Sturgeon says that she and her ministers have been grappling with this kind of stuff for a long time. \u201cA lot of the focus has been on continuity of transport \u2013 particularly ferries, and making sure we\u2019ll have supplies of food,\u201d she says. She also mentions \u201cadequate supplies of medicine\u201d, among \u201cmany and varied aspects of what this will mean for people\u2019s lives\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think the abdication of leadership on the part of Jeremy Corbyn right now will be the stuff of history books</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If he were here now, I suggest, Johnson might assure her that whatever the disastrous projections of a no-deal Brexit, and however much time and money has been spent preparing for one, it is a negotiating ploy. She half agrees, but insists that whatever he and his allies say, Johnson\u2019s reckless approach to leaving the EU is pointing to inevitable catastrophe.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not breaching confidences here because he\u2019s saying this publicly: he\u2019s saying he doesn\u2019t want a no-deal Brexit, and he doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s where we\u2019ll end up. But that\u2019s part of the delusion in his position. He has set a negotiating position that everybody knows is unachievable: getting rid of the backstop in its entirety, getting rid of the withdrawal agreement in its entirety and starting all over again. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody outside his circle and the hangers-on around it who thinks that is remotely achievable. So, if that\u2019s your starting point, where do you go from there, other than over that cliff-edge?\u201d</p> <p>The prospect of this calamity is a big part of Sturgeon\u2019s other focus of attention: the SNP\u2019s renewed push for a second independence referendum. It\u2019s her second since the Brexit vote: in 2017, she announced her intention to hold another Scottish referendum in 2019, only to retreat. Now, she says, the prospect of the UK finally leaving the EU \u2013 and the distinct prospect of us doing so in the most damaging way possible \u2013 makes the case for a vote unanswerable, even if senior Tories from the prime minister down have made it clear that they will not grant her government the relevant powers.</p> <p>She has said she wants a referendum on independence by 2021 and that the second half of next year would be the right time. \u201cThat\u2019s what I intend, yeah.\u201d</p> <p>So what happens when the Westminster government says she can\u2019t have one? \u201cWell, look, if we get to that bridge, I will set out how I intend to cross it \u2026 We\u2019ve got legislation going through the Scottish parliament that is necessary for a referendum on that timescale. When we get to the endpoint of that legislation, we\u2019ll then have that discussion with the UK government about the transfer of power.\u201d</p> <p>Will it be a discussion? Or a historic clash? \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see, OK? And then I\u2019ll set out how we intend to deal with that.\u201d</p> <p>After her meeting with Johnson, she said he hadn\u2019t been \u201cat his most comfortable\u201d when talking about the case for a second independence vote. What did she mean by that? \u201cHe didn\u2019t have much of an answer. He can defend the union and oppose independence: that\u2019s entirely legitimate. He kept trying to get back to the substance of the argument about independence. And the point I made back to him was: \u2018Let\u2019s have the debate on the substance, but let\u2019s have it out there and let the public decide.\u2019 I suggested we might do a live TV debate on it, at which point he decided it was time to go,\u201d she says laughing. \u201cOr his advisers decided it was time to go.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9467afc6461bcf3941f007673483f025b28d350c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9467afc6461bcf3941f007673483f025b28d350c/255_354_5505_3303/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sturgeon with Alex Salmond in 2013, launching the Scottish government\u2019s white paper on independence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sturgeon with Alex Salmond in 2013, launching the Scottish government\u2019s white paper on independence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2014, political discourse was already smattered with fake news and polarised nastiness, and, although most of the debate around Scottish independence was substantial and serious, the independence referendum campaign and its aftermath were no exception. Before and after, for example, I met lots of people who had read online that the vote was rigged, and seemed to believe it, and occasionally witnessed aggression that could explode in an instant, online and in the real world. Another Scottish referendum, I suggest, could potentially be a horrible, rancorous mess.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it has to be. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inevitable at all. The kind of tone and tenor of political debate, and I\u2019m not just talking Scotland here, I\u2019m talking globally \u2026 of course that concerns me. I think it should concern every right-thinking politician. I think one of the challenges for politicians who don\u2019t want politics to continue in that direction is that we have got to be prepared to stand up for a reasoned, logical and respectful way of political debate.\u201d</p> <p>But do people even listen? It\u2019s out of her control, surely? \u201cBut the alternative is a counsel of despair \u2026 that\u2019s not the kind of politician I am. I think there\u2019s a need for politicians who actually value a type of political debate to stand up for that, and defend it, however difficult and, at times, seemingly hopeless that may be.\u201d</p> <p>A little later, she expands further: \u201cWithout saying that anything will ever be perfect, if you contrast the independence referendum with the Brexit referendum, they were worlds apart. You had an electorate in Scotland in 2014 that was highly informed, engaged and knew what they were talking about. That wasn\u2019t the case in 2016, when the equivalent of the 800-page independence prospectus was the lie on the side of the bus.\u201d</p> <p>There is one aspect of the immediate future that we can only talk about in the most minimal way. At some point next year, Salmond will go on trial on two charges of attempted rape, nine of sexual assault, two of indecent assault and one of breach of the peace \u2013 allegations that he continues to strongly deny. Inevitably, the outcome of any Scottish referendum partly hinges on what happens, doesn\u2019t it?</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it does. I don\u2019t think it does. We\u2019re talking here about the future of a country. But, for reasons you will understand, it\u2019s not something I\u2019m able to talk about in any more depth or at any more length.\u201d</p> <p>Does she expect to be a participant in the trial? \u201cLook, it\u2019s a criminal process. It would be utterly inappropriate for me to say anything about it.\u201d</p> <p>Leaving aside another independence referendum, the big event that may well materialise very soon is a UK general election. In 2017, amid talk of public weariness about another independence referendum, the SNP lost 21 Westminster seats. Now, she thinks the prospect of Brexit would make things very different. South of the border, I remind her, there is a lot of talk about looking on the bright side of Labour\u2019s dismal poll numbers: the idea that they could at least win enough seats to strike some kind of deal with the SNP and take power that way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc9b451d8c86bb3313b3c4453faa6b22100f7953\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc9b451d8c86bb3313b3c4453faa6b22100f7953/0_86_4252_2551/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sturgeon talking to Jeremy Corbyn in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sturgeon talking to Jeremy Corbyn in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI have fought two general elections now as SNP leader, and, in both of them, I have been pretty candid. We would always want to be part of a progressive alternative to a Tory government. That remains the case. That said, I\u2019m no great fan of Jeremy Corbyn. I think his lack of leadership on Brexit in particular \u2026 well, if we do crash out without a deal, he will bear almost as much responsibility as Theresa May or Boris Johnson. I can\u2019t see the SNP going into formal coalition with Labour.\u201d</p> <p>Does she rule it out? \u201cLook, I think in politics you\u2019ve got to be careful. But it would not be my intention, to go into a formal coalition. I said that in 2015 and 2017 \u2013 that\u2019s not a new thing. But some kind of progressive alliance that could lock the Tories out of government \u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be a blank-cheque type scenario. We would want Jeremy Corbyn to take a very firm anti-Brexit position. We would look to do what was right for Scotland.\u201d (If Brexit were somehow cancelled, Sturgeon has said that the possibility of an independence referendum would remain because \u201cScotland needs to keep its options as open as possible.\u201d)</p> <p>Our time is running out: among Sturgeon\u2019s engagements today is a Scottish cabinet meeting, which will spend \u201ca fair chunk of time\u201d talking about no-deal planning. I have only one more question: what would be her advice to someone who lives in England? \u201cMove to Scotland,\u201d she says, with a quiet laugh.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/05/sturgeon-warns-boris-johnson-not-to-block-independence-vote\">Nicola Sturgeon warns Boris Johnson not to block independence vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is she at least half-serious? \u201cMore than half-serious.

I can sort of understand it. But the answer to that can\u2019t be that Scotland just languishes with the rest of the UK and gets taken down the wrong path. I think the best thing Scotland can do for people who want a different path for England is to lead by example. We can show it can be done.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 August 2019. An earlier version incorrectly said Boris Johnson had entered Bute House before Nicola Sturgeon.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Early last week, for the briefest of moments, the tensions swirling around Scotland\u2019s relationship with England and the deepening UK crisis of Brexit were perfectly symbolised by Boris Johnson\u2019s arm. Amid the angry noise of a crowd of demonstrators, Johnson was on the steps of Bute House (the Edinburgh residence of the Scottish first minister) exchanging the usual opening pleasantries with Nicola Sturgeon for the benefit of photographers and TV crews. Then came the moment when everyone had to go inside \u2013 whereupon Johnson rather condescendingly extended one of his upper limbs, with a view to escorting Sturgeon into her own HQ. She appeared to say something, whereupon the arm went down and Johnson awkwardly walked in, a moment that inevitably went viral. \u201cI don\u2019t think I said: \u2018Put your arm down,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThose kind of things happen in a flash. But I am aware that he was trying to do something that some people would describe as chivalrous and other people would say was a subconscious powerplay. I was kind of aware of him trying to \u2026 usher me in.\u201d She smiles. \u201cAnd I think, in the instant, I thought: \u2018That\u2019s inappropriate \u2013 you go in first.\u2019 But these things happen in a nanosecond. It wasn\u2019t at all deliberate on my part.\u201d One thing, however, was certain: she did not look happy. \u201cAgain, you\u2019ve got to remember that these photos are taken in an instant,\u201d she insists. \u201cBut, that said, I abhor what he is trying to do to the UK. And I abhor what the implications of that are for Scotland. So I don\u2019t think it will be surprising to anyone to hear me say that I wasn\u2019t absolutely thrilled to be welcoming Boris Johnson as prime minister.\u201d Before that meeting, they had crossed paths once before \u2013 at the VE Day celebrations immediately after the 2015 general election, at which Johnson brusquely asked Sturgeon if granting the Scottish government full control over its tax and spending powers would silence calls for independence. \u201cWe walked together through Horse Guards Parade. And I vividly remember, he said something like \u2013 and this is not a direct quote \u2013 \u2018What would buy you off? Would full fiscal autonomy buy you off?\u2019 I said: \u2018No, not really.\u2019\u201d She laughs. Four years on, she conveys a similar sense of Johnson reducing complex questions to breezy inanities. \u201cTalking to him, there\u2019s a sort of surreal element to it,\u201d she says. \u201cHe talks about Brexit, and a no-deal Brexit in particular, as if there is nothing to worry about, and anyone who says there is just being pessimistic and downbeat. I was very frank with him that I think it would be catastrophic, if it were allowed to happen. But, you know, then there\u2019s just a waving of the hands, and: \u2018No \u2013 it\u2019ll all be fine, and anyone who says otherwise is just indulging in doom and gloom.\u2019 I described it after the meeting as dangerous. \u2019Cos it is dangerous.\u201d One other aspect of Sturgeon\u2019s discussions with Johnson is fascinating. To quote a profile of her published a few years ago, Sturgeon is \u201cstate-educated, working-class, left-leaning and believably human\u201d. Johnson, who, by contrast, swaggered to where he is along a familiar path that passed through Eton and Oxford, has created his borderline absurd persona with the kind of chutzpah that tends to be the preserve of the truly posh. Class, I suggest, must have been a constant subtext in their exchanges. \u201cI do think there\u2019s an element of \u2026\u201d she pauses. \u201cWell, I said a moment ago that he talks what, in my view, is a load of nonsense, with utter conviction. And I do think there was an element of that sense of entitlement; the idea that you can make anybody believe anything if you say it in a particular way.\u201d Sturgeon became first minister in late 2014, taking over from Alex Salmond after the referendum on Scottish independence was won by the no campaign, but her party was still in the midst of its imperial phase; it would go on to win 56 out of 59 Scottish seats in the 2015 general election. She is one of those politicians whose voice and mannerisms seem instantly familiar: the precise, sometimes overlong, distinctly lawyerly sentences; the way that even her most speech-like utterances contain enough everyday humanity to keep you interested. Her humour, when it enters the conversation, gives a subtle sense of someone who appreciates the ridiculousness of politics, particularly at a time like this. But, unlike Johnson, she is also at pains to point out that Brexit is deadly serious, and that Britain faces \u201cthe most rightwing government we have had in my lifetime, probably including the Thatcher governments\u201d. We talk for an hour in one of Bute House\u2019s meeting rooms on the same day that the Bank of England is saying that there is a one in three chance of a Brexit recession, and Sky News has published a wad of civil service documents warning that a no-deal exit could trigger \u201cpotential consumer panic and food shortages\u201d, \u201coperational gaps\u201d in policing and national security, and \u201claw and order challenges\u201d in Northern Ireland. Given that the UK was meant to leave the EU on 29 March, Sturgeon says that she and her ministers have been grappling with this kind of stuff for a long time. \u201cA lot of the focus has been on continuity of transport \u2013 particularly ferries, and making sure we\u2019ll have supplies of food,\u201d she says. She also mentions \u201cadequate supplies of medicine\u201d, among \u201cmany and varied aspects of what this will mean for people\u2019s lives\u201d. If he were here now, I suggest, Johnson might assure her that whatever the disastrous projections of a no-deal Brexit, and however much time and money has been spent preparing for one, it is a negotiating ploy. She half agrees, but insists that whatever he and his allies say, Johnson\u2019s reckless approach to leaving the EU is pointing to inevitable catastrophe. \u201cI\u2019m not breaching confidences here because he\u2019s saying this publicly: he\u2019s saying he doesn\u2019t want a no-deal Brexit, and he doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s where we\u2019ll end up. But that\u2019s part of the delusion in his position. He has set a negotiating position that everybody knows is unachievable: getting rid of the backstop in its entirety, getting rid of the withdrawal agreement in its entirety and starting all over again. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody outside his circle and the hangers-on around it who thinks that is remotely achievable. So, if that\u2019s your starting point, where do you go from there, other than over that cliff-edge?\u201d The prospect of this calamity is a big part of Sturgeon\u2019s other focus of attention: the SNP\u2019s renewed push for a second independence referendum. It\u2019s her second since the Brexit vote: in 2017, she announced her intention to hold another Scottish referendum in 2019, only to retreat. Now, she says, the prospect of the UK finally leaving the EU \u2013 and the distinct prospect of us doing so in the most damaging way possible \u2013 makes the case for a vote unanswerable, even if senior Tories from the prime minister down have made it clear that they will not grant her government the relevant powers. She has said she wants a referendum on independence by 2021 and that the second half of next year would be the right time. \u201cThat\u2019s what I intend, yeah.\u201d So what happens when the Westminster government says she can\u2019t have one? \u201cWell, look, if we get to that bridge, I will set out how I intend to cross it \u2026 We\u2019ve got legislation going through the Scottish parliament that is necessary for a referendum on that timescale. When we get to the endpoint of that legislation, we\u2019ll then have that discussion with the UK government about the transfer of power.\u201d Will it be a discussion? Or a historic clash? \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see, OK? And then I\u2019ll set out how we intend to deal with that.\u201d After her meeting with Johnson, she said he hadn\u2019t been \u201cat his most comfortable\u201d when talking about the case for a second independence vote. What did she mean by that? \u201cHe didn\u2019t have much of an answer. He can defend the union and oppose independence: that\u2019s entirely legitimate. He kept trying to get back to the substance of the argument about independence. And the point I made back to him was: \u2018Let\u2019s have the debate on the substance, but let\u2019s have it out there and let the public decide.\u2019 I suggested we might do a live TV debate on it, at which point he decided it was time to go,\u201d she says laughing. \u201cOr his advisers decided it was time to go.\u201d In 2014, political discourse was already smattered with fake news and polarised nastiness, and, although most of the debate around Scottish independence was substantial and serious, the independence referendum campaign and its aftermath were no exception. Before and after, for example, I met lots of people who had read online that the vote was rigged, and seemed to believe it, and occasionally witnessed aggression that could explode in an instant, online and in the real world. Another Scottish referendum, I suggest, could potentially be a horrible, rancorous mess. \u201cI don\u2019t think it has to be. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inevitable at all. The kind of tone and tenor of political debate, and I\u2019m not just talking Scotland here, I\u2019m talking globally \u2026 of course that concerns me. I think it should concern every right-thinking politician. I think one of the challenges for politicians who don\u2019t want politics to continue in that direction is that we have got to be prepared to stand up for a reasoned, logical and respectful way of political debate.\u201d But do people even listen? It\u2019s out of her control, surely? \u201cBut the alternative is a counsel of despair \u2026 that\u2019s not the kind of politician I am. I think there\u2019s a need for politicians who actually value a type of political debate to stand up for that, and defend it, however difficult and, at times, seemingly hopeless that may be.\u201d A little later, she expands further: \u201cWithout saying that anything will ever be perfect, if you contrast the independence referendum with the Brexit referendum, they were worlds apart. You had an electorate in Scotland in 2014 that was highly informed, engaged and knew what they were talking about. That wasn\u2019t the case in 2016, when the equivalent of the 800-page independence prospectus was the lie on the side of the bus.\u201d There is one aspect of the immediate future that we can only talk about in the most minimal way. At some point next year, Salmond will go on trial on two charges of attempted rape, nine of sexual assault, two of indecent assault and one of breach of the peace \u2013 allegations that he continues to strongly deny. Inevitably, the outcome of any Scottish referendum partly hinges on what happens, doesn\u2019t it? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it does. I don\u2019t think it does. We\u2019re talking here about the future of a country. But, for reasons you will understand, it\u2019s not something I\u2019m able to talk about in any more depth or at any more length.\u201d Does she expect to be a participant in the trial? \u201cLook, it\u2019s a criminal process. It would be utterly inappropriate for me to say anything about it.\u201d Leaving aside another independence referendum, the big event that may well materialise very soon is a UK general election. In 2017, amid talk of public weariness about another independence referendum, the SNP lost 21 Westminster seats. Now, she thinks the prospect of Brexit would make things very different. South of the border, I remind her, there is a lot of talk about looking on the bright side of Labour\u2019s dismal poll numbers: the idea that they could at least win enough seats to strike some kind of deal with the SNP and take power that way. \u201cI have fought two general elections now as SNP leader, and, in both of them, I have been pretty candid. We would always want to be part of a progressive alternative to a Tory government. That remains the case. That said, I\u2019m no great fan of Jeremy Corbyn. I think his lack of leadership on Brexit in particular \u2026 well, if we do crash out without a deal, he will bear almost as much responsibility as Theresa May or Boris Johnson. I can\u2019t see the SNP going into formal coalition with Labour.\u201d Does she rule it out? \u201cLook, I think in politics you\u2019ve got to be careful. But it would not be my intention, to go into a formal coalition. I said that in 2015 and 2017 \u2013 that\u2019s not a new thing. But some kind of progressive alliance that could lock the Tories out of government \u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be a blank-cheque type scenario. We would want Jeremy Corbyn to take a very firm anti-Brexit position. We would look to do what was right for Scotland.\u201d (If Brexit were somehow cancelled, Sturgeon has said that the possibility of an independence referendum would remain because \u201cScotland needs to keep its options as open as possible.\u201d) Our time is running out: among Sturgeon\u2019s engagements today is a Scottish cabinet meeting, which will spend \u201ca fair chunk of time\u201d talking about no-deal planning. I have only one more question: what would be her advice to someone who lives in England? \u201cMove to Scotland,\u201d she says, with a quiet laugh. Is she at least half-serious? \u201cMore than half-serious. We need more people in Scotland. Absolutely: move to Scotland.\u201d But if someone can\u2019t, or won\u2019t? \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult. And I don\u2019t have an obvious answer to that. I think the abdication of leadership on the part of Jeremy Corbyn right now will be as much of the stuff of the history books as what\u2019s happening in the Tory party. And I think it\u2019s tragic. If you\u2019re in Wales, vote for Plaid Cymru, obviously.\u201d She pauses, before she issues a few last sentences that come close to sounding like a compact speech. \u201cThroughout my political career, I\u2019ve had \u2013 and I don\u2019t mean this pejoratively \u2013 people like you almost portraying Scottish independence as some kind of betrayal of the left. I can sort of understand it. But the answer to that can\u2019t be that Scotland just languishes with the rest of the UK and gets taken down the wrong path. I think the best thing Scotland can do for people who want a different path for England is to lead by example. We can show it can be done.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 August 2019.
