For Erdo\u011fan, the loss of his hometown, where his political career began in the 1990s, was a personal blow.</p> \n<p>After weeks of AKP appeals, Turkey\u2019s electoral board upheld one complaint regarding ballot counting and annulled \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s victory, sparking outrage even within the ruling party\u2019s ranks, where some feared the board had dented the AKP\u2019s democratic credentials.</p> \n<p>At polling stations on Sunday both CHP and AKP voters stressed that they wanted the repeat election accepted as final.</p> \n<p>\u201cClearly there is some funny business going on here but I don\u2019t know what,\u201d said AKP voter Cihat I\u00e7yumaz, 65, who like many <em>Istanbullus</em> cut short his summer holiday to vote. \u201cFor me, chaos after this round of elections is the scariest outcome. I just want the candidate who is best for Istanbul to win.\u201d</p> \n<p>Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m worked hard in the second round of campaigning to close the gap with his rival, reaching out to the party\u2019s base in working class and conservative neighbourhoods, voters who punished the government for Turkey\u2019s economic crisis by staying away in March.</p> \n<p>However, in both a televised debate with \u0130mamo\u011flu and in conversations with voters, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m struggled to explain why the repeat election was necessary.</p> \n<p>\u0130mamo\u011flu was embraced by voters for a platform which focused on bringing people together across the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/19/news/19iht-19turkey.10165600.html\">city\u2019s religious, class and ethnic divides</a>, and was able to paint his new campaign as a battle for the future of Turkish democracy itself.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe AKP decision to go for a rerun was a colossal strategic mistake,\u201d said Turkish-American political scientist Soner \u00c7a\u011faptay. \u201cAnd the campaign was an uncharacteristic mess. For the first time in a long time, [the AKP] were on the back foot here, running after the opposition, who dominated the narrative.</p> \n<p>\u201cErdo\u011fan has to do some serious house-cleaning in his government and reassess his policy making process to bounce back from this, or the suggestion that this is the beginning of his decline will get louder.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rumours are already circulating that the second defeat could trigger a snap national election as Erdo\u011fan seeks to oust increasingly fractious elements in his governing coalition.</p> \n<p>Losing Istanbul for a second time is an unthinkable outcome for the AKP. Turkey\u2019s biggest city and economic heart, it accounted for 31% of GDP in 2017 and is an important driver of the government\u2019s unofficial patronage networks. It has been controlled by the ruling party and its Islamist predecessors for a quarter of a century.</p> \n<p>Observers note that \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s mandate is still far from assured: the 2015 general election which saw the AKP lose its majority in parliament was rerun and other charismatic challengers to Erdo\u011fan have been imprisoned or folded under pressure.</p> \n<p>The AKP still controls 25 of Istanbul\u2019s 39 districts and holds a majority in the municipal assembly, which will make it difficult for \u0130mamo\u011flu to deliver on campaign promises. The margin of his victory, however, shows that at least in Istanbul there is a strong appetite for change after 16 years of national AKP rule.</p> \n<p>\u201cTurkey has been ruled by a populist leader for almost two decades: he [Erdo\u011fan] has tried to erode the rule of law and take over the media,\u201d \u00c7a\u011faptay said.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople say it takes a long time to build a democracy, but today\u2019s result shows it takes a long time to kill a democracy too. Clearly, Turkey\u2019s democratic structures are incredibly resilient.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting: G\u00f6k\u00e7e Sara\u00e7o\u011flu</em></p>",

For Erdo\u011fan, the loss of his hometown, where his political career began in the 1990s, was a personal blow. After weeks of AKP appeals, Turkey\u2019s electoral board upheld one complaint regarding ballot counting and annulled \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s victory, sparking outrage even within the ruling party\u2019s ranks, where some feared the board had dented the AKP\u2019s democratic credentials. At polling stations on Sunday both CHP and AKP voters stressed that they wanted the repeat election accepted as final. \u201cClearly there is some funny business going on here but I don\u2019t know what,\u201d said AKP voter Cihat I\u00e7yumaz, 65, who like many Istanbullus cut short his summer holiday to vote. \u201cFor me, chaos after this round of elections is the scariest outcome. I just want the candidate who is best for Istanbul to win.\u201d Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m worked hard in the second round of campaigning to close the gap with his rival, reaching out to the party\u2019s base in working class and conservative neighbourhoods, voters who punished the government for Turkey\u2019s economic crisis by staying away in March. However, in both a televised debate with \u0130mamo\u011flu and in conversations with voters, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m struggled to explain why the repeat election was necessary. \u0130mamo\u011flu was embraced by voters for a platform which focused on bringing people together across the city\u2019s religious, class and ethnic divides, and was able to paint his new campaign as a battle for the future of Turkish democracy itself. \u201cThe AKP decision to go for a rerun was a colossal strategic mistake,\u201d said Turkish-American political scientist Soner \u00c7a\u011faptay. \u201cAnd the campaign was an uncharacteristic mess. For the first time in a long time, [the AKP] were on the back foot here, running after the opposition, who dominated the narrative. \u201cErdo\u011fan has to do some serious house-cleaning in his government and reassess his policy making process to bounce back from this, or the suggestion that this is the beginning of his decline will get louder.\u201d Rumours are already circulating that the second defeat could trigger a snap national election as Erdo\u011fan seeks to oust increasingly fractious elements in his governing coalition. Losing Istanbul for a second time is an unthinkable outcome for the AKP. Turkey\u2019s biggest city and economic heart, it accounted for 31% of GDP in 2017 and is an important driver of the government\u2019s unofficial patronage networks. It has been controlled by the ruling party and its Islamist predecessors for a quarter of a century. Observers note that \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s mandate is still far from assured: the 2015 general election which saw the AKP lose its majority in parliament was rerun and other charismatic challengers to Erdo\u011fan have been imprisoned or folded under pressure. The AKP still controls 25 of Istanbul\u2019s 39 districts and holds a majority in the municipal assembly, which will make it difficult for \u0130mamo\u011flu to deliver on campaign promises. The margin of his victory, however, shows that at least in Istanbul there is a strong appetite for change after 16 years of national AKP rule. \u201cTurkey has been ruled by a populist leader for almost two decades: he [Erdo\u011fan] has tried to erode the rule of law and take over the media,\u201d \u00c7a\u011faptay said. \u201cPeople say it takes a long time to build a democracy, but today\u2019s result shows it takes a long time to kill a democracy too. Clearly, Turkey\u2019s democratic structures are incredibly resilient.\u201d Additional reporting: G\u00f6k\u00e7e Sara\u00e7o\u011flu",

So what if they were \u201cremoaners\u201d, or Tory haters, or vacationing ministers in the Venezuelan government? Would it really have been better if they had let it be? Allowed whatever was happening to run its course, on the old, deplorable basis that it is intrinsically wrong to intervene in a \u201clovers\u2019 tiff\u201d?</p> <p>None of us yet knows precisely what took place between Johnson and Symonds. But \u2013 forgive my frustration \u2013 <em>that\u2019s the point</em>. The only defensible response of a neighbour in such circumstances was to contact the police.</p> <p>I have argued in the past that Johnson\u2019s turbulent private life is a poor basis on which to attack him. One of the great improvements in British political culture in recent decades has been the decline of moral puritanism: after the fiasco of John Major\u2019s \u201cback to basics\u201d strategy, a new and sensible consensus emerged that sexuality, infidelity and marital status are no long fair game in political conflict. But that shift does not represent a blank cheque. Yes, the police left Symonds\u2019 flat satisfied that \u201cthere were no offences or concerns apparent to officers\u201d. But the mere fact that the man poised to become prime minister in a few weeks was involved in an alarming altercation in which a neighbour felt it necessary to call police is self-evidently a legitimate matter for public inquiry.</p> <p>Broadcaster Iain Dale was quite right to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/22/boris-johnson-dodges-questions-about-row-with-partner\" title=\"\">press Johnson</a> on the matter at the Conservative leadership hustings in Birmingham on Saturday. Others should now do the same. We have absolutely no right to know more about, say, the petty private details of Johnson\u2019s prospective divorce from his second wife, or the state of his relationships with his children. We have every right to ask why his partner was screaming on Thursday night and telling him to \u201cget off\u201d her. The line between private and public was clearly breached, and it is time that some of Johnson\u2019s more fanatical supporters acknowledged this basic moral distinction.</p> <p>And there is another, more nuanced dimension to this grisly episode. The person who, so to speak, led us to the door of Symonds\u2019 flat in Camberwell is none other than Johnson himself. His repeated insistence in Birmingham that people didn\u2019t \u201cwant to hear about that kind of thing\u201d rang hollow precisely because \u2013 more than any other contemporary British politician \u2013 he has tried to turn public life into a game of personality, in which wit, confidence, charm and personal presence eclipse policy and substance. This is the proposition upon which his bid for the top job is based: that character is all. It is hardly surprising, then, that his character is now being examined as never before.</p> <p>One should perhaps more accurately say \u201ccharacter\u201d. For the personality that Johnson has presented to the world is a confection, a stage act with roots in his true nature but with many affectations and contrivances. He is, one should never forget, \u201cAl\u201d (for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-15401564/this-week-quiz-what-is-boris-johnson-s-full-name\" title=\"\">Alexander</a>) to his loved ones. \u201cBoris\u201d is a persona: it is his populist Conservative version of Ziggy Stardust, The Rock or Borat. It is a means to an end \u2013 and a potent one.</p> <p>Over the years, the character of \u201cBoris\u201d has proved to be a vehicle for some pretty horrible rhetoric: most recently, his declaration that a Muslim woman wearing the niqab resembled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/20/boris-johnson-cleared-over-burqa-comments\" title=\"\">a bank robber</a>\u201d and that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/06/boris-johnsons-burqa-remarks-fan-flames-of-islamophobia-says-mp\" title=\"\">it was</a> \u201cabsolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letterboxes\u201d. He has called homosexual men \u201c<a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/06/18/boris-johnson-lgbt-rights-record-anti-gay-slurs-liberal-stance/\" title=\"\">bum boys</a>\u201d. He has \u2013 unbelievably \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jan/23/london.race\" title=\"\">written about</a> \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d with \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d.</p> <p>His trick seems to be to scuttle behind the increasingly tattered defence that he is only trying to be funny, that his remarks have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/12/brexit-delay-means-defeat-boris-johnson-launches-campaign\" title=\"\">taken \u201cout of context\u201d</a>, that he is the victim of our old friend, political correctness gone mad.</p> <p>To his liberal audience, he says: lighten up.

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s begin with the straightforward part: any incident in which a woman is heard screaming in her home, and shouting \u201cGet off me!\u201d at a man, instantly becomes a matter not only of public interest but public responsibility. The precise motives of the neighbours who called the police on Thursday night to report the row between Boris Johnson and his partner, Carrie Symonds \u2013 and also alerted the Guardian \u2013 should be a matter of near total indifference. So what if they were \u201cremoaners\u201d, or Tory haters, or vacationing ministers in the Venezuelan government? Would it really have been better if they had let it be? Allowed whatever was happening to run its course, on the old, deplorable basis that it is intrinsically wrong to intervene in a \u201clovers\u2019 tiff\u201d? None of us yet knows precisely what took place between Johnson and Symonds. But \u2013 forgive my frustration \u2013 that\u2019s the point. The only defensible response of a neighbour in such circumstances was to contact the police. I have argued in the past that Johnson\u2019s turbulent private life is a poor basis on which to attack him. One of the great improvements in British political culture in recent decades has been the decline of moral puritanism: after the fiasco of John Major\u2019s \u201cback to basics\u201d strategy, a new and sensible consensus emerged that sexuality, infidelity and marital status are no long fair game in political conflict. But that shift does not represent a blank cheque. Yes, the police left Symonds\u2019 flat satisfied that \u201cthere were no offences or concerns apparent to officers\u201d. But the mere fact that the man poised to become prime minister in a few weeks was involved in an alarming altercation in which a neighbour felt it necessary to call police is self-evidently a legitimate matter for public inquiry. Broadcaster Iain Dale was quite right to press Johnson on the matter at the Conservative leadership hustings in Birmingham on Saturday. Others should now do the same. We have absolutely no right to know more about, say, the petty private details of Johnson\u2019s prospective divorce from his second wife, or the state of his relationships with his children. We have every right to ask why his partner was screaming on Thursday night and telling him to \u201cget off\u201d her. The line between private and public was clearly breached, and it is time that some of Johnson\u2019s more fanatical supporters acknowledged this basic moral distinction. And there is another, more nuanced dimension to this grisly episode. The person who, so to speak, led us to the door of Symonds\u2019 flat in Camberwell is none other than Johnson himself. His repeated insistence in Birmingham that people didn\u2019t \u201cwant to hear about that kind of thing\u201d rang hollow precisely because \u2013 more than any other contemporary British politician \u2013 he has tried to turn public life into a game of personality, in which wit, confidence, charm and personal presence eclipse policy and substance. This is the proposition upon which his bid for the top job is based: that character is all. It is hardly surprising, then, that his character is now being examined as never before. One should perhaps more accurately say \u201ccharacter\u201d. For the personality that Johnson has presented to the world is a confection, a stage act with roots in his true nature but with many affectations and contrivances. He is, one should never forget, \u201cAl\u201d (for Alexander) to his loved ones. \u201cBoris\u201d is a persona: it is his populist Conservative version of Ziggy Stardust, The Rock or Borat. It is a means to an end \u2013 and a potent one. Over the years, the character of \u201cBoris\u201d has proved to be a vehicle for some pretty horrible rhetoric: most recently, his declaration that a Muslim woman wearing the niqab resembled \u201ca bank robber\u201d and that it was \u201cabsolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letterboxes\u201d. He has called homosexual men \u201cbum boys\u201d. He has \u2013 unbelievably \u2013 written about \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d with \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d. His trick seems to be to scuttle behind the increasingly tattered defence that he is only trying to be funny, that his remarks have been taken \u201cout of context\u201d, that he is the victim of our old friend, political correctness gone mad. To his liberal audience, he says: lighten up. To his hardcore rightwing fans, he winks like Donald Trump, as if to say: I\u2019m on your side, just so you know. Indeed, it has become something close to a parlour game in the political and media class to chatter about \u201cthe two Borises\u201d and wonder which is authentic. Which will we get in No 10: nice Dr Jekyll, the supposedly liberal Johnson who won the London mayoralty by posturing as a friend of immigration, diversity and pluralism? Or nasty Mr Hyde: the burqa-bashing populist who has led the charge for Brexit, says \u201cfuck business\u201d (and, presumably, the jobs that go with it) and treated the case of an imprisoned British-Iranian woman with indefensible sloppiness? I find this parlour game \u2013 this reduction of British politics to a low-rent Churchillian soap opera \u2013 unforgivable. No less outrageous is the undiminished determination of the Tory tribe to give this untrustworthy charlatan the keys to No 10. As Dale pressed him on Saturday, the audience of true believers booed. They (like Johnson) regard difficult questions as an impertinence: it is no accident that their hero looked so furious in the BBC candidates\u2019 debate last week, or that he has yet to agree to take part in the planned Sky News debate with Jeremy Hunt. Trump once said that he could \u201cshoot somebody\u201d in the \u201cmiddle of Fifth Avenue\u201d and not lose any votes on the road to the Republican presidential nomination. Johnson apparently enjoys his own version of this immunity within the Tory stockade. Why do they cling to him so?
