The band\u2019s underwhelming Kinks and Who knock-offs were woeful enough, but it was their misbegotten version of the Mary Poppins clunker Chim Chim Cher-ee that tipped BBC bosses over the edge. The cover, the report charged, \u201ckills the song completely\u201d. For those of us for whom Bowie remains the last word in cool, pick \u2019n\u2019 mix musical genius, avant garde gender-bending and transgressive self-reinvention, there were some pretty tough moments in David Bowie: Finding Fame (BBC2). I had steeled myself for his novelty single The Laughing Gnome, with its unacceptable animation and its Bernard Cribbins-and-Benny Hill-on-helium-impersonate-Pinky-and-Perky vocals. And yet, when the back story of how it was made was related, I contemplated the middle distance with rueful mien. Then there was the miming. My God, the miming.

Political parties try to use their first 100 days to frame their government; failed ones try to use the last 100 to reframe it, which is exactly what the Morrison government is doing. Right now the government is going all in on a fear campaign about what will happen under Labor. They\u2019re coming for your retirement income, they will flood the country with asylum seekers and potential terrorists, they will destroy the value of your home. The old adage that \u201ceveryone hates fear campaigns, but they work\u201d is very much in place. The government has many problems right now: most voters don\u2019t understand why the leader they have is in that job; the two Coalition parties are riven with internal discord; they have no climate change policy; they have overseen a catastrophe in the Murray-Darling Basin; they are under attack in their safest seats from independents; and people don\u2019t much fear Bill Shorten. But the main reason they\u2019re trying to reframe the campaign with fear is because they have little to brag about. Unfortunately, they are running their fear campaign in perhaps the shonkiest manner possible. A year ago things were looking up \u2013 2017 had seen a surge of employment growth, and the Liberal party under Turnbull could have argued that the hard yards were over, the payoff of their policies in the form of higher incomes was coming. And yet now the clouds on the economic horizon are darkening and we might be about to be hit with economic rain, without having even experienced a brief moment of sunshine. Take the statements of the governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe. In June 2017 he noted that \u201cwage growth remains low and this is likely to continue for a while yet\u201d. So, not good. A year ago in the first statement in 2018 Lowe noted that \u201cwage growth remains low. This is likely to continue for a while yet, although the stronger economy should see some lift in wage growth over time.\u201d So not good but it should get better ... over time. This week when announcing that the RBA was keeping interest rates at 1.5%, he noted: \u201cThe stronger labour market has led to some pick-up in wages growth, which is a welcome development. The improvement in the labour market should see some further lift in wages growth over time, although this is still expected to be a gradual process.\u201d So \u201cstill over time\u201d, still \u201ca gradual process\u201d. Just wait, it\u2019s coming... maybe. Be patient. But the government cannot be patient. It has less than 100 days, and more importantly it has had five years, and in those five years, while they have had success on employment and better budget numbers, households are no better off \u2013 indeed many find their economic situation is worse. The former public servant David Plunkett, who spends more time looking at the impact of changes in the tax and transfer system on incomes than just about anyone, has estimated that during the Turnbull/Morrison government most income earners have become worse off in real terms, and the poorest are the worst affected. This accords with my own findings that average employee contributions and average household disposable incomes are at 2010 levels in real terms, and about the best anyone can say is that they will get better ... over time ... but it\u2019s a gradual process. Not the type of things that looks good on a campaign bumper sticker. The problem for the government is that the Reserve Bank believes the outlook is much less positive than the government is estimating for its budget revenue forecasts. I have long been sceptical about the government\u2019s claims that wages will return to growing above 3% per annum within a year or two. The latest budget figures suggest by June 2020 wage growth will hit 3% and 3.5% the following year. Not only do those figures suggest a rosiness of economic activity, they also suggest a nice boost in income tax revenue. The Reserve Bank however doesn\u2019t have to worry about pumping up budget numbers or winning elections and on Wednesday, Lowe revealed a chart in a speech to the National Press Club that had wages growing by just 2.5% and 2.75% in 2020 and 2021. That \u201cgradual process\u201d looks like at least three years. On Friday the Reserve Bank also released its latest statement on monetary policy and it contained a large downgrading of its growth forecasts. It took its forecast for GDP growth for this year from 3.25% to 3% and for the 2019-20 financial year from 3.25% to 2.75%. That is a significantly lower amount of growth predicted to come down the pipeline and does not give the government much to cheer about. Boasting that their economic management has not resulted in better living standards or much hope of better ones in the next three years is not going to win votes. And so the switch has well and truly been flicked to negative. Less than a hundred days to go. A hundred days of fear about the economy to disguise the lack of achievement.",

The honours system is clearly flawed and the prime minister should take steps to remove honours from people who bring their office into disrepute.\u201d The MP\u2019s comments follow those of the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, who also called for Green to lose his knighthood after the businessman\u2019s decision to drop a legal case against the Daily Telegraph, which had been investigating claims he had harassed staff and used non-disclosure agreements to pay them off and secure their silence. It has also been suggested that the corporate culture over which Green presided was a continued cause for concern even after several aggrieved employees had received the pay-offs. Peter Hain, the Labour peer who last year used parliamentary privilege to name Green as the businessman who had been accused of sexual and racial harassment, said his decision to speak out had come after being approached by a person \u201cintimately involved\u201d in the case because he \u201chad been known to speak up for human rights from my anti-apartheid days\u201d. \u201cTheir motive was that nothing had really changed [after the pay-offs had been agreed] and that the alleged behaviour was continuing \u2013 that was another factor motivating me,\u201d Hain said. \u201cYou could tell just discussing it with them, the feeling of anger that whatever that person did, whatever steps he or she took to gain redress, they didn\u2019t get anywhere.\u201d When the claim was put to him yesterday, Green declined to comment. In the past he has always denied any claims of sexual and racial harassment. Hain\u2019s decision last October to stand up in the House of Lords and identify Green as the businessman at the centre of allegations being investigated by the Telegraph ignited a ferocious legal battle which ended on Friday when the magnate, who with his wife, Tina, is worth some \u00a32bn, abandoned his court action preventing the newspaper from reporting some of the allegations against him. The Telegraph said the Arcadia boss, whose brands include Topshop and Miss Selfridge, had paid out millions of pounds in settlements to staff members who include a senior female executive who Green allegedly called a \u201cnaughty girl\u201d. The newspaper said he allegedly kissed her face on a number of occasions, slapped her behind and commented on her weight. According to the Telegraph, Green also allegedly drew attention to the dreadlocks of a black male employee in front of other staff, and referred to him \u201cthrowing spears in the jungle\u201d. Lawyers for Green told the Telegraph that it was \u201cdenied that any of Sir Philip\u2019s conduct towards employees amounted to any type of crime, or anything that would amount to gross misconduct, or a serious risk to health and safety\u201d. The use of non disclosure agreements now faces calls for reform as a result of the case. \u201cNDAs should never be used to suppress allegations of criminal behaviour so the next Labour government will review the statute book to ensure that the law protects the voices of survivors,\u201d Lavery said. Late on Saturday the Telegraph published further revelations and said its investigation showed \u201cwitness testimonies were left out of a report into sexual harassment.\u201d It said Arcadia group was \u201cfacing accusations of a cover-up\u201d as a result.",

      "body": "<p>There can be no respite for a title-chasing team with four league defeats by February and, though Manchester City have recovered impressively to close the gap on Liverpool at the top of the Premier League, Sunday\u2019s visit of Chelsea is a reminder of where things started to go wrong.</p> \n<p>People were still talking about City going through the season unbeaten when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/08/chelsea-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Chelsea won 2-0 at Stamford Bridge</a> in December.

Maurizio Sarri\u2019s side had something of an aberration, too, when attempting to play Eden Hazard as a central focus of attack, but have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/18/gonzalo-higuain-london-chelsea-juventus\" title=\"\">signed Gonzalo Higua\u00edn</a> since and are ostensibly stronger than they were a couple of months ago. \u201cHigua\u00edn is a striker of exceptional quality, the type of guy who doesn\u2019t need too much to score a goal,\u201d Guardiola said.</p> \n<p>City have one or two players of their own who fit that description, though Sarri does not believe it will be a game of many chances and reckons it might not be decided by the forwards. \u201cThe midfield of Manchester City is one of the best in the world,\u201d the Chelsea manager said.</p> \n<p>\u201cNot only Fernandinho but also Kevin De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, David Silva. Technically there is nothing better in Europe, so it will be really difficult to be in control of the match, but I think that is the area that will decide the game, more than the strikers. They are still able to play if you manage to stop Fernandinho, we are able to play if you stop Jorginho. We have options in midfield, but maybe they have more options than us.\u201d</p> \n<p>Guardiola encountered Sarri in Champions League group-stage games against Napoli last season and is an admirer of both his old team and his new one. \u201cI liked watching Napoli and I can see what he is trying to do with Chelsea,\u201d the City manager said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ec415144-8a01-4474-89ef-b2c4da369a72\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Manchester City (86 points)</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>24 Apr </b>Man Utd (a)<br><b>28 Apr&nbsp;</b>Burnley (a)<br><b>4 May&nbsp;</b>Leicester (h)<br><b>12 May&nbsp;</b>Brighton (a)</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Liverpool (85 points)</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>21 Apr&nbsp;</b>Cardiff (a)&nbsp;<br><b>26 Apr&nbsp;</b>Huddersfield (h)<br><b>5 May&nbsp;</b>Newcastle (a)&nbsp;<br><b>12 May&nbsp;</b>Wolves (h)</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>What Sarri is principally trying to do with Chelsea is earn enough points to guarantee Champions League football next season. Like City, Chelsea cannot afford many more slip-ups, which is one reason Guardiola has referred to Sunday\u2019s game as a cup final.</p> \n<p>While that might be overplaying it slightly, bearing in mind that the same teams meet in a real cup final in two weeks, there is no doubt that it comes at the end of a demanding and significant week. Guardiola has preferred not to dwell on what Liverpool have been doing, but if City are able to take all nine points from playing Arsenal, Everton and Chelsea in the space of eight days it will magnify the potential importance of points lost by their rivals in recent matches.</p> \n<p>That is not Guardiola playing mind games, that is simply what the Premier League table has to say. Were the City manager interested in making Liverpool feel more jittery he would have been pointing out how tough it is to go out in front and stay there.</p> \n<p>Instead he has kept a consistent focus on his own team\u2019s performances. \u201cIf we win against Chelsea I am sure we will be fighting to be champions again at the end of the season,\u201d Guardiola said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/07/liverpool-premier-league-title-race-manchester-city-eni-aluko\">Something may be shifting mentally at Liverpool.

We don\u2019t underestimate anyone.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the last five or six years no English champion has managed to put up a decent defence the following season, but we intend to do so and we are not giving up.\u201d</p> \n<p>That seems to have been noticed on Merseyside, though Guardiola is dismissive of suggestions that after 29 years in the title wilderness Liverpool lack the winning mentality necessary to become champions. \u201cI\u2019m not buying that at all,\u201d the City manager said. \u201cThis is a team that went all the way to the Champions League final last season. Maybe Leicester and West Ham just did a good job. I don\u2019t think Liverpool dropping points had anything to do with their mentality. It is easy to drop points in this league, as we know, but all I can say is that when you are seven points behind you are under pressure to reduce that lead.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe have done that, we have had two tough games in a week and the important thing is that we did not lose those games.

      "bodyText": "There can be no respite for a title-chasing team with four league defeats by February and, though Manchester City have recovered impressively to close the gap on Liverpool at the top of the Premier League, Sunday\u2019s visit of Chelsea is a reminder of where things started to go wrong. People were still talking about City going through the season unbeaten when Chelsea won 2-0 at Stamford Bridge in December. A raft of speculative features about who could possibly stop Pep Guardiola\u2019s winning machine suddenly became redundant when Crystal Palace and Leicester added their names to the list in the same month. City have steadied the ship since the turn of the year, getting away with a lapse at Newcastle thanks to Liverpool failing to cash in against Leicester and West Ham, but Chelsea arrive with their own need for points, having had the assumption of a top-four finish challenged by Manchester United\u2019s revival. Maurizio Sarri\u2019s side had something of an aberration, too, when attempting to play Eden Hazard as a central focus of attack, but have signed Gonzalo Higua\u00edn since and are ostensibly stronger than they were a couple of months ago. \u201cHigua\u00edn is a striker of exceptional quality, the type of guy who doesn\u2019t need too much to score a goal,\u201d Guardiola said. City have one or two players of their own who fit that description, though Sarri does not believe it will be a game of many chances and reckons it might not be decided by the forwards. \u201cThe midfield of Manchester City is one of the best in the world,\u201d the Chelsea manager said. \u201cNot only Fernandinho but also Kevin De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, David Silva. Technically there is nothing better in Europe, so it will be really difficult to be in control of the match, but I think that is the area that will decide the game, more than the strikers. They are still able to play if you manage to stop Fernandinho, we are able to play if you stop Jorginho. We have options in midfield, but maybe they have more options than us.\u201d Guardiola encountered Sarri in Champions League group-stage games against Napoli last season and is an admirer of both his old team and his new one. \u201cI liked watching Napoli and I can see what he is trying to do with Chelsea,\u201d the City manager said. What Sarri is principally trying to do with Chelsea is earn enough points to guarantee Champions League football next season. Like City, Chelsea cannot afford many more slip-ups, which is one reason Guardiola has referred to Sunday\u2019s game as a cup final. While that might be overplaying it slightly, bearing in mind that the same teams meet in a real cup final in two weeks, there is no doubt that it comes at the end of a demanding and significant week. Guardiola has preferred not to dwell on what Liverpool have been doing, but if City are able to take all nine points from playing Arsenal, Everton and Chelsea in the space of eight days it will magnify the potential importance of points lost by their rivals in recent matches. That is not Guardiola playing mind games, that is simply what the Premier League table has to say. Were the City manager interested in making Liverpool feel more jittery he would have been pointing out how tough it is to go out in front and stay there. Instead he has kept a consistent focus on his own team\u2019s performances. \u201cIf we win against Chelsea I am sure we will be fighting to be champions again at the end of the season,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cThis season is a bit different from the last two or three, it might be a battle right to the end. That is what I like about it. People say we underestimated Newcastle, or opponents in Europe, or whatever, but I say we are in the Carabao Cup final and still fighting in all the competitions. We don\u2019t underestimate anyone. \u201cIn the last five or six years no English champion has managed to put up a decent defence the following season, but we intend to do so and we are not giving up.\u201d That seems to have been noticed on Merseyside, though Guardiola is dismissive of suggestions that after 29 years in the title wilderness Liverpool lack the winning mentality necessary to become champions. \u201cI\u2019m not buying that at all,\u201d the City manager said. \u201cThis is a team that went all the way to the Champions League final last season. Maybe Leicester and West Ham just did a good job. I don\u2019t think Liverpool dropping points had anything to do with their mentality. It is easy to drop points in this league, as we know, but all I can say is that when you are seven points behind you are under pressure to reduce that lead. \u201cWe have done that, we have had two tough games in a week and the important thing is that we did not lose those games. If we get through the next one we will have a gap of six days to recover, and we will probably need it.\u201d",

But somehow, against the odds, she recovered to win the decider. \u201cI\u2019m feeling pretty rubbish but it\u2019s OK,\u201d said Konta, who fell to her knees after her win and then needed help to get back to her feet. \u201cThe only thought I had was even if it was just me that was going to be out here, at least that would be one obstacle that was going to be a challenge for her, at least make her win it. \u201cI just wanted to control what I could, really understand quickly my limitations and try to play within that and bring the most out of myself as possible, just with what I had, and I definitely zoned in.\u201d Boulter had earlier given Britain the perfect start, defeating Jorovic to extend her perfect record this week to 4-0. It was a cool, impressive performance from the 22-year-old, who until Wednesday had never played a Fed Cup singles match before, but who has emerged from this week with confidence and real belief that big things are in her future. \u201cI am close to tears right now,\u201d Boulter said after her win over the world No 117, a year younger than her at 21. It has been a really long week. It means everything and so much more than that. I put everything on the court and have so much heart. It all just means so much to me. I wasn\u2019t going in to this week thinking: \u2018I\u2019m going to win four matches.\u2019 I was just putting my heart on the line and doing the best that I can, and then seeing what comes of it.\u201d Given the effort required and having missed out in the play-off to Japan last year and to Romania in 2017, Britain will now await Tuesday\u2019s draw with extra anticipation. \u201cHere\u2019s hoping for a home tie in April,\u201d Konta said.",

If England are to impose their pace on the game, they will need to neutralise him after a tackle. \u201cWe can get better,\u201d said Jones when asked about the Ireland victory. He has lost Maro Itoje, who suffered knee ligament damage against Wales, but did not rule out the second-row returning against Wales in Cardiff in a fortnight. He cited the bulk of the French pack but it will not be as heavy as it was against Wales, when it weighed in collectively at 50kg heavier, with the prop Uini Atonio dropped and the mobile F\u00e9lix Lambey preferred to Paul Willemse at lock. \u201cWe have one of the lightest second-rows in the world,\u201d said the France coach, Jacques Brunel. Lambey and the prop Demba Bamba, who has dislodged Atonio, are 31kg lighter than the players they have replaced as Les Bleus seek greater mobility and staying power, but they have picked a team not to lose rather than to win. It is a seminal moment for Jones, which perhaps explains his edginess, but if England are to make an impact in the World Cup \u2013 and France are among their group opponents \u2013 they need to leave their mark on Sunday afternoon. Which they should, as a certain bird comes home to roost for their opponents.",

Internal polling for political parties and environment groups suggests Australians are increasingly concerned that this is linked to climate change and want to see action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a priority at this year\u2019s federal election. It matches public polling that has found a comfortable majority accept it is a significant problem that needs to be addressed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25edca135beb5b9b210250d21a73b12017501c79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25edca135beb5b9b210250d21a73b12017501c79/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Parison outside his home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Parison\u2019s traditional Queenslander home, elevated on concrete pillars, remained largely intact during the floods.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Smee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But after a decade of political fights and ideological warfare, discussion on the subject is often still a combat zone. The Coalition government would prefer not to talk about it at all.</p> <p>Australia is, of course, no stranger to extreme weather - bushfire, flooding, rains and skin-peeling heat are central to its history and mythology - but the contrasts this southern summer have been particularly stark. Lesley Hughes, a professor of biology at Macquarie University and councillor with publicly funded communication body the Climate Council, says few parts of the continent have not experienced an extreme weather event in recent months.</p> <p>More than 3000 kilometres to Townsville\u2019s south, Tasmania is burning. For the second time in four years, dry lightning strikes sparked a series of blazes on the usually cool, temperate island, many of them in the vast world heritage wilderness area that covers nearly half its territory. In one 30-hour period in mid-January, an extended electrical storm danced across the summer sky, sending down more than 2400 lightning strikes without rain.</p> <p>About 200,000 hectares - 3% of the state\u2019s surface - has been burned, including unique alpine heath landscapes that had not been touched by fire for centuries. The fires are expected to burn for another month at least. Hundreds of people, many of them from in and around the southern town of Geeveston, spent the best part of two weeks camping at evacuation centres. Six homes were destroyed before rain late in the week reduced the threat to communities.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The prime minister is still pandering to the right-wing sceptics in his party</p> <footer> <cite>Lesley Hughes</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere, communities in the sparsely populated Australian outback continue to deal with the fallout from a long-term drought. On social media, a Greens MP in New South Wales, David Shoebridge, highlighted a constituent <a href=\"A%20politician%20claimed%20one%20of%20his%20constituents%20was%20paying%20A$70%20a%20week%20on%20drinking%20water%20for%20her%20and%20her%20son.\">forced to pay $70 a week on drinking water</a> for her and her son after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShoebridgeMLC/with_replies\">the raw water supply in the town of Walgett was turned off</a>.</p> <p>A political battle is also raging over the use of water in the vast Murray-Darling river system that fans across the country\u2019s eastern state agricultural districts, with drought-afflicted downstream communities arguing they are being denied water by a national river plan that did not factor in climate change and has been designed to keep dams full at water-hungry industrial agriculture sites in northern states.</p> <p>This claim has been backed by a royal commission convened by the state of South Australia, which lies at the end of the river system, and the continuing disaster of up to a million fish having perished in three mass kills in the west of New South Wales due to water deoxygenation, with more deaths predicted.</p> <h2>Inquiry into Townsville flooding</h2> <p>The sense of a country playing extreme weather bingo has heightened as flood and drought collided this week, requiring the defence force to be called in to distribute fodder to cattle that had suddenly found their long-parched home under water. By Friday, it was clear that up to 300,000 cattle had been killed in the floods. With evidence mounting that authorities were unprepared for the extent of the rainfall, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, announced an independent inquiry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9f2bf51896a749ed7eca1b2d71f32ee77839cd37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f2bf51896a749ed7eca1b2d71f32ee77839cd37/0_321_3303_1981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bushfire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australia is no stranger to bushfires but the contrasts this southern summer have been particularly stark.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For most, the most obvious extreme weather shift has been the heat. January was Australia\u2019s hottest month on record by a wide margin, with average national temperatures nearly a degree beyond the previous benchmark and 2.9 degrees warmer than the long-term mean. In New South Wales, the average temperature was nearly 6 degrees hotter than what has been considered normal for the past century.</p> <p>Blair Trewin, senior climatologist with the Bureau of Meteorology, says: \u201cEven taking into account the sustained long-term warming trend of a degree or so over a century, this is certainly at the far end of expectations.\u201d</p> <p>It is the heat that seems to be shifting public concern about climate change. Political polling suggests it is registering in the top two or three issues of concern for voters in a way it has not since the 2007 election, when the country was enduring a decade long drought, if not ever. The trend is headed in this direction even in some outer suburban electorates, which have traditionally been more driven by jobs and cost-of-living issues.</p> <p>But the shift is not universal. The government is hearing similar messages, but there has been no change in messaging from prime minister Scott Morrison. He visited the Tasmanian fires and Queensland floods within a 24-hour period, speaking with people who had been forced to flee their homes, thanking emergency service workers and, in Townsville, was photographed climbing into a tank. He drew no link between the extreme weather and emissions in his public comments and he dismissed as a stunt a suggestion by the Greens that he should apologise for backing coal given there was evidence it was making natural disasters worse.</p> <p>The Nationals leader and deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, went a step further while visiting the site of the Menindee Lake mass fish kill, choosing language that suggested outright scepticism about climate science.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"be29d08f82998a3df950b723e6d9d999e6af452c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be29d08f82998a3df950b723e6d9d999e6af452c/0_302_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dead fish in the Darling River weir pool in Menindee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dead fish in the Darling River weir pool in Menindee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Mccrabb/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe are looking at climate, of course, (but) climate has been changing since year dot,\u201d he said, before adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to go down a path of renewables, which is not going to solve anything apart from de-industrialising Australia and making sure we don\u2019t do manufacturing here and pushing electricity bills into the unaffordable state.\u201d</p> <p>While concern about climate change is growing, there is evidence this position retains support \u2013 Essential Media polling late last year, for instance, suggested a slim majority of voters may back public financial support for a new coal power development than would oppose it, though more than quarter said they did not know what they thought.</p> <h2><strong>D</strong>ependent on mining</h2> <p>The suggestion governments may force coal industries to close are particularly challenging issues in Townsville, which is the centre of support for the Carmichael coalmine, the long-stalled greenfield project proposed by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani that has become a proxy for debate over climate change. The mining industry posits itself as a jobs saviour. But, as always, views are split.</p> <p>Katie McGrath was among the lucky ones in the Queensland floods, having got caught up and seeing her car in a metre of water. A social worker who works in Townsville but lives on nearby Magnetic Island, she had not realised how great the threat was before getting into trouble. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the island flood like this before,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc45389b512bf731b874ba65a46b1ba42cdb53a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc45389b512bf731b874ba65a46b1ba42cdb53a5/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Up to 300,000 cattle have been killed in the western Queensland floods\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Up to 300,000 cattle have been killed in the western Queensland floods.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McGrath has little doubt that what Townsville has been experiencing is part of a bigger picture, but acknowledges she is out of step with many in her community.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s clearly things happening around the world that are alarming,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like anything, if you don\u2019t know enough about it then you seek advice from experts, and what they\u2019re telling us is that we\u2019ve got a real problem with climate change and we need to do something about it.\u201d</p> <p>But despite the experts, Townsville is the epicentre of support for the Adani coalmine. For every flood affected resident who is concerned about climate change, several others share Parison\u2019s views.</p> <p>Roughly one in 10 people in Townsville are unemployed. About 16% of the population is university educated, compared with 22% Australia wide. People want economic growth and employment opportunities. And, for all the boom and bust cycles places such as Townsville have endured in the past, the mining industry still posits itself as a jobs saviour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/05/ive-got-nothing-valuable-left-the-heart-wrenching-return-to-townsvilles-flooded-homes\">'I\u2019ve got nothing valuable left': the heart-wrenching return to Townsville's flooded homes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But McGrath believes adequate communication about the opportunities that come with a cleaner economy is missing.</p> <p>\u201cFor those people, work\u2019s been hard to come by for a while and that\u2019s been a real issue for people in Townsville,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s not really been much put forward, and this region is really dependent on mining. People want to see jobs in mining, they want to see Adani go ahead. That\u2019s the priority for people at the moment. Whether they agree with climate change, care about it or whatever, that\u2019s a secondary priority to making ends meet now.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think people are addicted to coal, or think that coal\u2019s great. We haven\u2019t been offered different information or alternatives about different jobs that are available. At the moment that\u2019s not there.\u201d</p> <p>Her observations underline the challenge in some parts of the country for the Labor party, which is favoured to win the election with a platform of taking climate change seriously, but beyond the electricity sector is yet to explain what meeting its more ambitious greenhouse targets would mean.</p> <p>Part of the challenge of communicating climate change is explaining the science, particularly the extent to which any extreme event can be linked to increasing emissions.</p> <p>Attribution science is a rapidly evolving field. Lesley Hughes, who helped launch a Climate Council report called Weather Gone Wild, says emissions are effectively loading the dice to increase the likelihood of an extreme weather event. \u201cWhat we are now observing is consistent with the climate science \u2013 as the Earth warms up, more extreme weather is inevitable,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In the case of the floods, a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, which in the event of a storm can mean heavier rain in a shorter space of time.</p> <p>In the case of the Tasmanian fires, not only has the state become warmer (2.5 degrees above average in January) but low-pressure weather patterns that used to produce rain over the state have also moved further south as the climate has warmed, and evaporation rates have increased. Both increase the risk of dry lightning strike causing a blaze. Hobart, the Tasmanian capital, recorded just 0.4 millimetres of rain in January, the lowest on record.</p> <p>Hughes says governments can obfuscate for only so long before publicly accepting that climate change is now both a mitigation and adaptation challenge. Failing to acknowledge the role humans are playing is holding back conversations about, for instance, whether Australia needs to invest in fire-fighting aircraft rather than sharing with the US, given the northern and southern fire seasons are increasingly overlapping.</p> <p>\u201cThe prime minister is still pandering to the right-wing sceptics in his party by not talking about climate change. But arguing black is white doesn\u2019t make it so,\u201d she says. \u201cThe government has to accept these events are going to get worse over the next few decades and plan accordingly \u2013 both to adapt and to be part of the solution instead of the problem.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The people of Townsville know about heavy rain, but this was new. Over the past fortnight, the northern Queensland city\u2019s 180,000 residents have been hit by a monsoon strengthened by a low-pressure front that dragged moist air south from the equator to Australia\u2019s top end. It dumped an unprecedented 1.4 metres of rain in less than two weeks \u2013 roughly double what falls on London in a year. The ensuing chaos has wrecked homes and caused hundreds of millions of dollars of damage to property. Two men have drowned and videos posted to social media have shown crocodiles climbing trees and taking to elevated highways in search of shelter. But amid the deluge, not everyone heeded the evacuation advice. Mark Parison was one of those who stayed. The tide where he lives in Hermit Park peaked at least two metres high on some homes and the road was decorated with debris \u2013 furniture, white goods and children\u2019s toys \u2013 pulled from homes as the water receded. But Parison\u2019s traditional Queenslander home, elevated on concrete pillars, remained largely intact. As he moved piles of damaged property to the roadside for local authorities to collect, he told Guardian Australia why he ignored the advice to run. \u201cIt was a scary old night [but] this house has been here for a long time. We decided \u2026 it\u2019s been here that long, it\u2019s been through some big floods,\u201d he said. Asked if he was concerned that climate change was making floods more extreme, he was clear: \u201cIf anyone mentions that, I\u2019ll punch \u2018em.\u201d \u201cThe weather events seem to be getting more extreme. Whether it\u2019s manmade or natural or who knows. \u201cThese people crying about climate change, they\u2019ve got to look at how they live themselves. They\u2019re still driving around in cars, they\u2019re still wearing nice clothes. They\u2019re using mobile phones. So give that up, I\u2019ll start listening to you. \u201cCity people are stalling us. We need the economy here to be boosted.\u201d In a city with nearly one in ten unemployed his view holds purchase. And so goes some of the public debate in Australia about the impact of rising greenhouse gas emissions. A historically hostile summer The north Queensland flooding is far from the only punishing event in what has been, even by the standards of the continent, a historically hostile summer. Internal polling for political parties and environment groups suggests Australians are increasingly concerned that this is linked to climate change and want to see action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a priority at this year\u2019s federal election. It matches public polling that has found a comfortable majority accept it is a significant problem that needs to be addressed. But after a decade of political fights and ideological warfare, discussion on the subject is often still a combat zone. The Coalition government would prefer not to talk about it at all. Australia is, of course, no stranger to extreme weather - bushfire, flooding, rains and skin-peeling heat are central to its history and mythology - but the contrasts this southern summer have been particularly stark. Lesley Hughes, a professor of biology at Macquarie University and councillor with publicly funded communication body the Climate Council, says few parts of the continent have not experienced an extreme weather event in recent months. More than 3000 kilometres to Townsville\u2019s south, Tasmania is burning. For the second time in four years, dry lightning strikes sparked a series of blazes on the usually cool, temperate island, many of them in the vast world heritage wilderness area that covers nearly half its territory. In one 30-hour period in mid-January, an extended electrical storm danced across the summer sky, sending down more than 2400 lightning strikes without rain. About 200,000 hectares - 3% of the state\u2019s surface - has been burned, including unique alpine heath landscapes that had not been touched by fire for centuries. The fires are expected to burn for another month at least. Hundreds of people, many of them from in and around the southern town of Geeveston, spent the best part of two weeks camping at evacuation centres. Six homes were destroyed before rain late in the week reduced the threat to communities. Elsewhere, communities in the sparsely populated Australian outback continue to deal with the fallout from a long-term drought. On social media, a Greens MP in New South Wales, David Shoebridge, highlighted a constituent forced to pay $70 a week on drinking water for her and her son after the raw water supply in the town of Walgett was turned off. A political battle is also raging over the use of water in the vast Murray-Darling river system that fans across the country\u2019s eastern state agricultural districts, with drought-afflicted downstream communities arguing they are being denied water by a national river plan that did not factor in climate change and has been designed to keep dams full at water-hungry industrial agriculture sites in northern states. This claim has been backed by a royal commission convened by the state of South Australia, which lies at the end of the river system, and the continuing disaster of up to a million fish having perished in three mass kills in the west of New South Wales due to water deoxygenation, with more deaths predicted. Inquiry into Townsville flooding The sense of a country playing extreme weather bingo has heightened as flood and drought collided this week, requiring the defence force to be called in to distribute fodder to cattle that had suddenly found their long-parched home under water. By Friday, it was clear that up to 300,000 cattle had been killed in the floods. With evidence mounting that authorities were unprepared for the extent of the rainfall, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, announced an independent inquiry. For most, the most obvious extreme weather shift has been the heat. January was Australia\u2019s hottest month on record by a wide margin, with average national temperatures nearly a degree beyond the previous benchmark and 2.9 degrees warmer than the long-term mean. In New South Wales, the average temperature was nearly 6 degrees hotter than what has been considered normal for the past century. Blair Trewin, senior climatologist with the Bureau of Meteorology, says: \u201cEven taking into account the sustained long-term warming trend of a degree or so over a century, this is certainly at the far end of expectations.\u201d It is the heat that seems to be shifting public concern about climate change. Political polling suggests it is registering in the top two or three issues of concern for voters in a way it has not since the 2007 election, when the country was enduring a decade long drought, if not ever. The trend is headed in this direction even in some outer suburban electorates, which have traditionally been more driven by jobs and cost-of-living issues. But the shift is not universal. The government is hearing similar messages, but there has been no change in messaging from prime minister Scott Morrison. He visited the Tasmanian fires and Queensland floods within a 24-hour period, speaking with people who had been forced to flee their homes, thanking emergency service workers and, in Townsville, was photographed climbing into a tank. He drew no link between the extreme weather and emissions in his public comments and he dismissed as a stunt a suggestion by the Greens that he should apologise for backing coal given there was evidence it was making natural disasters worse. The Nationals leader and deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, went a step further while visiting the site of the Menindee Lake mass fish kill, choosing language that suggested outright scepticism about climate science. \u201cWe are looking at climate, of course, (but) climate has been changing since year dot,\u201d he said, before adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to go down a path of renewables, which is not going to solve anything apart from de-industrialising Australia and making sure we don\u2019t do manufacturing here and pushing electricity bills into the unaffordable state.\u201d While concern about climate change is growing, there is evidence this position retains support \u2013 Essential Media polling late last year, for instance, suggested a slim majority of voters may back public financial support for a new coal power development than would oppose it, though more than quarter said they did not know what they thought. Dependent on mining The suggestion governments may force coal industries to close are particularly challenging issues in Townsville, which is the centre of support for the Carmichael coalmine, the long-stalled greenfield project proposed by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani that has become a proxy for debate over climate change. The mining industry posits itself as a jobs saviour. But, as always, views are split. Katie McGrath was among the lucky ones in the Queensland floods, having got caught up and seeing her car in a metre of water. A social worker who works in Townsville but lives on nearby Magnetic Island, she had not realised how great the threat was before getting into trouble. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the island flood like this before,\u201d she said. McGrath has little doubt that what Townsville has been experiencing is part of a bigger picture, but acknowledges she is out of step with many in her community. \u201cThere\u2019s clearly things happening around the world that are alarming,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like anything, if you don\u2019t know enough about it then you seek advice from experts, and what they\u2019re telling us is that we\u2019ve got a real problem with climate change and we need to do something about it.\u201d But despite the experts, Townsville is the epicentre of support for the Adani coalmine. For every flood affected resident who is concerned about climate change, several others share Parison\u2019s views. Roughly one in 10 people in Townsville are unemployed. About 16% of the population is university educated, compared with 22% Australia wide. People want economic growth and employment opportunities. And, for all the boom and bust cycles places such as Townsville have endured in the past, the mining industry still posits itself as a jobs saviour. But McGrath believes adequate communication about the opportunities that come with a cleaner economy is missing. \u201cFor those people, work\u2019s been hard to come by for a while and that\u2019s been a real issue for people in Townsville,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s not really been much put forward, and this region is really dependent on mining. People want to see jobs in mining, they want to see Adani go ahead. That\u2019s the priority for people at the moment. Whether they agree with climate change, care about it or whatever, that\u2019s a secondary priority to making ends meet now. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think people are addicted to coal, or think that coal\u2019s great. We haven\u2019t been offered different information or alternatives about different jobs that are available. At the moment that\u2019s not there.\u201d Her observations underline the challenge in some parts of the country for the Labor party, which is favoured to win the election with a platform of taking climate change seriously, but beyond the electricity sector is yet to explain what meeting its more ambitious greenhouse targets would mean. Part of the challenge of communicating climate change is explaining the science, particularly the extent to which any extreme event can be linked to increasing emissions. Attribution science is a rapidly evolving field. Lesley Hughes, who helped launch a Climate Council report called Weather Gone Wild, says emissions are effectively loading the dice to increase the likelihood of an extreme weather event. \u201cWhat we are now observing is consistent with the climate science \u2013 as the Earth warms up, more extreme weather is inevitable,\u201d she says. In the case of the floods, a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, which in the event of a storm can mean heavier rain in a shorter space of time. In the case of the Tasmanian fires, not only has the state become warmer (2.5 degrees above average in January) but low-pressure weather patterns that used to produce rain over the state have also moved further south as the climate has warmed, and evaporation rates have increased. Both increase the risk of dry lightning strike causing a blaze. Hobart, the Tasmanian capital, recorded just 0.4 millimetres of rain in January, the lowest on record. Hughes says governments can obfuscate for only so long before publicly accepting that climate change is now both a mitigation and adaptation challenge. Failing to acknowledge the role humans are playing is holding back conversations about, for instance, whether Australia needs to invest in fire-fighting aircraft rather than sharing with the US, given the northern and southern fire seasons are increasingly overlapping. \u201cThe prime minister is still pandering to the right-wing sceptics in his party by not talking about climate change. But arguing black is white doesn\u2019t make it so,\u201d she says. \u201cThe government has to accept these events are going to get worse over the next few decades and plan accordingly \u2013 both to adapt and to be part of the solution instead of the problem.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Wilderness Society will target former environment ministers Greg Hunt and Josh Frydenberg and former prime minister Tony Abbott in its first major federal election campaign in a decade. After a summer in which temperature records tumbled and up to a million fish died in in the Lower Darling, climate change and the environment are front and centre in voters\u2019 minds before the expected May election, according to conservation groups and the major parties\u2019 internal polling. The Wilderness Society is crowdfunding ads that target the Coalition\u2019s record on the environment and call for new laws including an Environmental Protection Agency, a policy backed by the Greens and Labor at its national conference in December. The environmental group\u2019s targets are the usually safe Liberal seats of Flinders, held by Hunt on 7.2% after a redistribution, Kooyong, held by 12.8% by Frydenberg, and Warringah, where Tony Abbott faces a number of independents attacking his climate record, including Zali Steggall. A ReachTEL poll commissioned by GetUp released on Sunday shows Steggall leading the former prime minister 54% to 46% on a two-party-preferred basis in Warringah. Lyndon Schneiders, the national director of The Wilderness Society, told Guardian Australia the campaign is a \u201crecognition of the crisis confronting the environment and climate across the length and breadth of the country\u201d. \u201cThe Darling River is dying, the Tassie wilderness is in flames, two million hectares of forest have been cleared in the past five years in Queensland alone and iconic species such as the koala are hurtling towards extinction,\u201d he said. \u201cClimate change is making an already bad situation catastrophic.\u201d Schneiders said the Coalition government had been \u201cmissing in action\u201d after working for five years to undermine environmental protections. The Coalition will introduce a new climate change policy before the election which is expected to include an extension of the emissions reduction fund which pays polluters to reduce emissions, and has hinted it will do more to protect native species. In August Malcolm Turnbull ditched the emissions reduction component of the national energy guarantee in a bid to save his leadership, and under Scott Morrison the government has pushed ahead with a plan to underwrite new power generation, including from coal power plants. The Wilderness Society campaign will be built around voter contact such as door-knocking and phone-banking, with volunteers drawn from its membership of 30,000. \u201cThe first wave of the campaign will draw attention to the record of those members of the government who have been most responsible for failed policies and decisions [Abbott, Frydenberg and Hunt],\u201d Schneiders said. \u201cThe campaign will also focus on a range of other seats across the country which are home to environmentally-concerned everyday Australians who are angry and want leadership and change.\u201d Guardian Australia understands those seats include Bonner in Queensland, held by Ross Vasta, and Reid in Sydney, held by Craig Laundy. The campaign will also run in South Australia. The Australian Conservation Foundation chief executive Kelly O\u2019Shanassy said in October that its campaign will focus on \u201cmiddle Australia\u201d by targeting the seats of Chisholm and McNamara \u2013 both in Melbourne \u2013 and Bonner. Schneiders said charity law meant The Wilderness Society \u201ccan\u2019t direct people how to vote but we can put on record the actions, decisions and policies of those responsible for these national disasters\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s ultimately up to the voters to work out what threatened species policies they want from their politicians and it\u2019s also up to voters to work out what politicians they want to make into threatened species.\u201d",

And I think her \u2013 and Bernie [Sanders] \u2013 are running on platforms that speak to the working class and how they\u2019re being screwed over by the rich and powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think she\u2019s a great messenger for it.\u201d While there was optimism about Warren\u2019s candidacy at her rally, she enters an already crowded Democratic field amid renewed controversy over her past identification as Native American. For years now \u2013 since even before he was president \u2013 Trump has needled Warren on the issue, calling her \u201cPocahontas\u201d. He and others accuse Warren of falsely presenting herself as Native American to gain unfair advantages in life. The controversy was re-ignited last week when the Washington Post published Warren\u2019s 1986 registration card for the Texas State Bar. In it, she listed \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d as her race. Warren has now apologised repeatedly for identifying as Native American, saying in recent days that she \u201cshould have been more mindful of the distinction with tribal citizenship and tribal sovereignty\u201d. She still maintains that Native American ancestry was part of her family\u2019s story passed down to her. How damaging the controversy will be remains to be see. Warren enters a diverse Democratic field where other candidates belong to minority groups: New Jersey senator Cory Booker is African American; California senator Kamala Harris was born to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father. Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is both the first Hindu and first Samoan-American member of Congress, and the former San Antonio mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro is Latino. When the Democratic race gets heated, Warren\u2019s portrayal of race could prove to be a point of attack. Peter Devlin, a 56-year-old dentist from the nearby town of North Andover, said he was at the rally to hear what Warren had to say but said that the Native American controversy \u201cis going to be a problem\u201d for her campaign. \u201cI voted for her as senator, but I\u2019m concerned about her electability,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough run. She\u2019s got a bit of baggage and she\u2019s so sort of cliche progressive liberal that I think there\u2019s a lot of America that\u2019s not up for that. But I want to hear what she\u2019s up to.\u201d However, other attendees, like 64-year-old Vicki Ward, who drove two hours to the event from Vermont, were ready to throw their support behind Warren on the first day of the senator\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cI think she\u2019s got the qualities that we need,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we need a woman president and I think it will be the fight of our lives.\u201d Maryann Johnson, who came to Warren\u2019s announcement from New Hampshire, also said she was already sold on Warren. \u201cI basically agreed with everything she said. We need to have more equality, there needs to be less corruption in government,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s inspiring.\u201d",

The 21-year-old student was reported missing nine days ago in the early hours of Friday 1 February, having last been seen after a night out near the University of Hull, where she studies philosophy. An intensive sustained search has since been mounted by police and volunteers, with officers scouring the gardens and alleyways in the area around Squire\u2019s home on Saturday. Sharing a picture of a large screen featuring Squire\u2019s face, Humberside police tweeted: Police are believed to be examining CCTV footage, which appeared to show a man getting in and out of a car minutes after the last sighting of Squire, close to where she is thought to have disappeared, according to ITV News, which said the clip is \u201ca central part\u201d of the investigation. Det Supt Matt Hutchinson has appealed to the media and public to refrain from speculation about the name of the suspect arrested in relation to the search. \u201cThis is a live investigation with multiple active lines of inquiry and any speculation as to the names of suspects or details of the case could seriously harm the investigation and our ability to find Libby,\u201d he said. Police were granted a further 36 hours\u2019 detention on Friday to question the man, who was arrested on Wednesday night at an address about half a mile from Squire\u2019s home, and then late on Saturday said they had been granted a further extension, until 9pm on Sunday.

The new vote would give the British people a simple choice: to confirm the decision or stay in the EU. The initiative, aimed at breaking the political impasse, is being advanced by Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson and has won the support of prominent Remainers in the Tory party including Sarah Wollaston, Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry. Kyle says the idea, which is likely to be put forward as an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill, is also being taken seriously by \u201cpeople at a high level in government\u201d as a potential way to resolve the Brexit crisis. The amendment would offer all MPs the chance to support, or abstain on, the withdrawal bill and would specify that, if passed, the decision would be implemented on the condition it was put to the public for approval in a second referendum. If the amendment passed through parliament but the deal was rejected in the subsequent referendum, the UK would stay in the EU under current arrangements. If, however, the British people confirmed the decision of MPs to leave the EU under the terms of May\u2019s deal, Brexit on these terms would immediately come into effect without any need for it to return to parliament. \u201cThe beauty of this plan is that it holds attractions for both Leavers and Remainers. For Leavers, if the deal is confirmed by the British people, it offers a definitive end to the withdrawal process with Brexit sealed once and for all.

Kyle said the plan should also appeal to Theresa May as the only way to get her deal approved both by the factionalised House of Commons and the British public. May\u2019s deal was rejected by a margin of 230 votes, with 118 Tory MPs opposed. Together with Commons clerks, the two Labour MPs have found a precedent for the plan in the way the Good Friday Agreement on Northern Ireland power-sharing passed through parliament in 1998.

At the time we felt, and you saw the reaction of the players, which sometimes gives you a fair idea on the touchline. But when you see it again it\u2019s an absolute blatant penalty. Between the linesman and the referee that\u2019s ten yards away, I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s not given. And of course they go up the other end and get a third goal. What I\u2019m not taking away from is the performance of Burnley, who play a certain way, they do it very well, and they\u2019re in good form at the moment. I thought we tested their goalkeeper, but we didn\u2019t put our chances away and you can\u2019t do that against a good side like Burnley. The penalty would change the momentum of the game, but we conceded poor goals, and that\u2019s not like us. My overriding feeling is one of disappointment at the goals we have conceded.\u201d Hughton was given every opportunity by BT Sport to blow his top and go off on a rant, but he kept his counsel.

I\u2019ve tried not to go overboard on it, I\u2019ve only said that over a season you want it to balance out. So we got one today that\u2019s an important one. But the other side of it is, our penalty is a definite penalty. Maybe it\u2019s payback for last week, when Barnes should have had one.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c5f2c79e4b00ef6acc6ac8b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-09T19:41:36.284Z\">7.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Some instructive footage of Burnley walking off the pitch at the end of the match.</strong> James Tarkowski is larking around with Jeff Hendrick, miming the shoulder-turn and handball the midfielder got away with, just before the Clarets were awarded a match-settling penalty of their own.

      "bodyText": "Well, history told us not to expect too many goals from this fixture. But we got them, with some added controversy thrown in for free. Brighton are within their rights to feel aggrieved over the penalty non-decision, but Burnley were worth their win on balance, just that little bit more staunch in defence, more clinical up front. And of course the luck was with them tonight, as it arguably wasn\u2019t against Southampton last week. These things have a habit of coming around. The verdict from the ground is below. Thanks for reading; nighty night! And now the view of Chris Hughton. \u201cIt\u2019s an obvious penalty. At the time we felt, and you saw the reaction of the players, which sometimes gives you a fair idea on the touchline. But when you see it again it\u2019s an absolute blatant penalty. Between the linesman and the referee that\u2019s ten yards away, I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s not given. And of course they go up the other end and get a third goal. What I\u2019m not taking away from is the performance of Burnley, who play a certain way, they do it very well, and they\u2019re in good form at the moment. I thought we tested their goalkeeper, but we didn\u2019t put our chances away and you can\u2019t do that against a good side like Burnley. The penalty would change the momentum of the game, but we conceded poor goals, and that\u2019s not like us. My overriding feeling is one of disappointment at the goals we have conceded.\u201d Hughton was given every opportunity by BT Sport to blow his top and go off on a rant, but he kept his counsel. A class act, isn\u2019t he? Sean Dyche is asked a few questions about the match, and he praises his centre forwards Barnes and Wood, plus the keeper Heaton. But let\u2019s be honest, we just want to know his opinion of the Hendrick incident. \u201cI think you\u2019ll probably be aware of the decisions that haven\u2019t gone for us lately. I\u2019ve tried not to go overboard on it, I\u2019ve only said that over a season you want it to balance out. So we got one today that\u2019s an important one. But the other side of it is, our penalty is a definite penalty. Maybe it\u2019s payback for last week, when Barnes should have had one.\u201d Some instructive footage of Burnley walking off the pitch at the end of the match. James Tarkowski is larking around with Jeff Hendrick, miming the shoulder-turn and handball the midfielder got away with, just before the Clarets were awarded a match-settling penalty of their own. A lot of laughter, they know they\u2019ve got away with one tonight. Tom Heaton, all cheeky smiles, is interviewed by BT Sport and handed the man-of-the-match award. \u201cIt was a massive win. We took our goals really well. In fairness, the ball hit Jeff\u2019s hand, bounced up, but it\u2019s difficult for the referee, I don\u2019t think it was a penalty, I don\u2019t think he really meant it. You\u2019ll tell me more than I can see it. It\u2019s one of those, it sometimes goes for you, we got the breaks today.\u201d Anthony Knockaert engages the referee Stuart Atwell in a full and frank discussion over the non-award of a penalty for the Hendrick handball. But he\u2019s getting nowhere. It\u2019s over. Burnley got the decision, while Brighton were left to seethe, their ill fortune magnified when they pulled a goal back immediately after Barnes scored Burnley\u2019s third. The result means Brighton end the weekend in 14th spot, ahead of Burnley on goal difference, on 27 points. The pair are both three points clear of the final relegation spot, which is now filled by Southampton. This is going to be some run-in at both ends of the table. And that\u2019s it! Burnley escape from the relegation zone to leap to 15th place in the table. But their win wasn\u2019t without controversy, as Brighton didn\u2019t get a penalty for Jeff Hendrick\u2019s clear handball, Ashley Barnes going straight up the other end to win and score a spot kick himself. It was the crucial difference between 1-2 and 0-3. But the breaks went with Burnley tonight. 90 min +3: Knockaert whips a cross in from the right. Tarkowski heads out powerfully; the ball caroms off the nearby Mee and nearly ricochets into the bottom right! But Heaton, who has been superb all evening, reacts brilliantly to smother, ensuring Burnley\u2019s evening doesn\u2019t end in high farce. 90 min +2: Dunk and Barnes tangle out on the Burnley left. A foul to the visitors, and a chance to run the clock further down. 90 min +1: There will be four added minutes. The first passes without incident. 90 min: Happily, Mee is up and about. He\u2019s taken a sore one on that leg, but is able to rejoin the game after running it off. 88 min: Propper floats one in from the left. Murray contests the ball with Mee, who clears but falls awkwardly. He\u2019s down in a lot of pain, holding his left leg. Tarkowski and Heaton make frantic calls for the physio. 87 min: It\u2019s still pelting down, the ball making trails now as it\u2019s passed across the pitch. And it\u2019s all happening in the Brighton half, the home team\u2019s late rally having flagged somewhat. 85 min: Jahanbakhsh whips a flat cross into the Burnley box from the left. It\u2019s a dangerous ball, but well defended by Tarkowski, who has been excellent this evening. 83 min: Another penalty appeal! Knockaert swings one in from the right. Propper nips in ahead of Tarkowski at the near post, but falls to the ground in the process. All innocent, and it\u2019s another goal kick. But Brighton are fuelled by a sense of injustice here, and it\u2019s making for a hell of a finale! 82 min: Montoya works hard down the right to win a corner. The kick\u2019s sent to the far post, where Duffy climbs on Barnes and heads wide. Goal kick, though Brighton are claiming for everything now, in the hope of getting some karmic payback. 80 min: The Amex is a bubbling cauldron of righteous indignation, and this doesn\u2019t help. Murray, just inside the Burnley box on the left, tries to flick a ball inside but it hits the arm of Cork. No penalty, because Cork\u2019s arm was in a natural position and the two players were right next to each other. Still, that\u2019s a decision the referee could have done without after his mistake over the Hendrick handball. 78 min: Burnley win a corner down the left. It\u2019s hit long, and Mee should probably head home at the far post, but he flashes his effort wide. Incidentally, Ryan was booked for his role in the penalty. What a huge difference that minute of madness has made to this match! A free kick near the centre circle as Bissouma breaks down the right. He\u2019s hauled back by Westwood, who is booked. Knockaert takes the set piece, and Duffy rises highest to guide a wonderful header down and into the bottom right! Barnes gets up and takes the penalty himself, slotting it into the bottom left. That\u2019s a controversial goal all right, because Hendrick definitely handled when turning and clearing up the other end. A huge difference between 1-2 and 0-3. 72 min: Well this is quite the event. Brighton want a penalty as Hendrick controls the ball away from Murray with his chest ... but then it hits his upper arm. No decision. With Brighton surrounding the ref, Burnley stream up the other end, Barnes totally clear! Barnes attempts to round Ryan on the right, and is brought down. The ball breaks to Wood, who misses the open goal, but that\u2019ll be a spot kick! 71 min: Bissouma nearly releases Bong into the Burnley box with a cute pass down the left channel, but Tarkowski reads the play well, comes across, and blooters the ball into Row Z. 70 min: And now the match has slipped into a proper lull, a state of affairs right up Burnley\u2019s street. 68 min: Some sterile domination from Brighton. They ping it around the middle, and Burnley seem more than happy to let them get on with it. 66 min: So Brighton make a double change, replacing Locadia and Gross with Jahanbakhsh and Bissouma. 65 min: The rain continues to belt down, matching the mood of the home support. Brighton are going nowhere all of a sudden. 63 min: Ryan didn\u2019t cover himself in glory with that goal. He got a hand on Wood\u2019s shot, but it bent weakly and the ball squeaked past. Brighton had been the better side since the restart by some distance, so that\u2019s a blow. This comes out of nothing, and against the run of play. Dunk hits the ball long. His pass is easily headed back upfield, allowing McNeil to race down the middle of the park, pretty much unchallenged. He slides a ball wide left for Wood, who glides inside and curls a low shot across Ryan and into the bottom right for his second goal of the evening! 59 min: Propper, on the left-hand edge of the penalty box, looks for the top right with a curler. It\u2019s wild and over the bar. Heaton\u2019s not so proactive this time as he takes a bloody age to restart the game with a goal kick, and the referee bollocks him accordingly. The fans give him the pantomime bird. 57 min: Heaton rushes out from his area to ping a quick free kick forward towards Barnes and Wood, with Burnley light at the back. Very proactive from the keeper, as that free kick was in the centre circle. Unfortunately the levels of proactivity aren\u2019t matched by his accuracy; it\u2019s easy for Brighton to clear. 55 min: Brighton continue to press Burnley back. They\u2019re getting plenty of crosses in from both flanks, thought the Mee-Tarkowski partnership is dealing with everything that\u2019s been launched at them. 53 min: Knockaert has been busy since coming on; now he skitters down the right but can\u2019t quite get his cross in. Brighton have hogged the ball since the restart. Burnley have looked agitated and nervous in possession. On the touchline, Sean Dyche orders his men to calm down. 51 min: The first corner, from the right, leads to a second, on the left. From that second one, Knockaert drives at Barnes, who has gone to ground early, sliding along the wet turf on his trousers. Knockaert goes over Barnes, and screams for a penalty, but he\u2019s not getting it because Barnes had eventually won the ball before contact was made. A smarter, arguably more cynical, player would have purchased a cheap penalty from Barnes then. But Knockaert didn\u2019t play a smart hand. 49 min: Brighton stress-test the Burnley defence by looping crosses in from both wings. It holds up. Then Knockaert takes his first tilt at the back line, running at Taylor down the right. He wins a corner for his efforts. 48 min: March has been one of Brighton\u2019s stand-out performers this evening, so it\u2019s sad to see him forced to depart with an injury. He\u2019s replaced by Knockaert. 47 min: Cork is brought down in the centre circle. Heaton launches it long as Burnley load the Brighton box. Tarkowski eyebrows it on, but neither Barnes nor Wood have read the flick-on, and the ball flies through to Ryan. We\u2019re off again! Brighton get the second half underway. It\u2019s pelting stair-rods. No changes. Half-time reading. Ben Fisher was our man at St Mary\u2019s this afternoon to witness the Bluebirds putting the cat amongst the pigeons down at the foot of the Premier League. Here\u2019s his take on a dramatic match that has consequences for both Brighton and Burnley. And that\u2019s that for the half. Burnley were the better team for most of the first 45, though the hosts came back into things towards the end there, and will wonder how they\u2019ve not scored with at least one of their efforts. It\u2019s not a technical classic, but it\u2019s a really good rollocking Premier League battle, and it could be a very entertaining second half. The evening\u2019s young, so stay awhile with us, don\u2019t be heading out for your Saturday night just yet! 45 min: Tarkowski and Murray challenge for a high ball, 35 yards out. The Burnley man\u2019s put an elbow on the back of the Brighton striker\u2019s nut there. He\u2019s got away with it, though. Then it\u2019s Murray v Tarkowski II, as the resulting free kick\u2019s looped into the area from the left. The defender eyebrows it out for a corner. From the set piece, Duffy plants a downward header towards the bottom right. For once, Heaton is beaten ... but Hendrick is on the line to hack clear! That was such a good header; great defending by Hendrick. 43 min: Burnley have been the better team on balance; nevertheless Brighton haven\u2019t been bad, and Heaton\u2019s had to make some big saves. Locadia crosses from the left. At the far stick, Gross loops a header towards Murray in the middle. Murray is preparing to tap a header home from inches out, but then Heaton flicks it away from him with the tips of his fingers, and the ball sails out for a corner, left of goal. Nothing comes from the resulting set piece. What a save! 40 min: It\u2019s started raining heavily on the south coast. The cold droplets ping off Sean Dyche\u2019s fizzing pate, the Burnley boss on a hot setting, Brighton having been awarded a corner down the right after a battle between March and Taylor. The ball had clearly come last off the Brighton man. Eventually the lino calls the ref over and explains the error of his ways. It\u2019s a goal kick. Dyche calms down, a little bit. 38 min: March embarks on a rococo ramble down the right. He pulls one back for March, who slams a shot towards the top right. Bardsley saves the goal by taking one flush in the grid. 37 min: A stat from the BT Television Service: of the 16 matches Brighton have fallen behind in this season, they\u2019ve only won one. More worryingly for the hosts, they\u2019ve lost 12. Burnley will be feeling pretty good about themselves right now. Southampton, who as things stand will be slipping into the relegation zone, will not. 35 min: Gross nips down the right and crosses towards Murray at the near post. The Brighton goal machine does very well to power a header wide right; it was a very difficult chance. But close equals no cigar. 34 min: Bong works hard for a little space down the left, but his low cross is too close to Heaton, who snaffles without fuss. Burnley go up the other end, Barnes pealing a shot from distance towards the bottom right; Ryan parries then claims. 33 min: Burnley are much the better side. Hendrick causes all manner of panic in the Brighton box. The ball finds Bardsley, coming in from the right. Bardsley shoots low and hard towards the bottom-right corner, but Ryan is on the spot to gather. 31 min: Westwood loops the corner towards the far post. Tarkowski isn\u2019t far away from meeting it from close range, but the ball\u2019s an inch too high. A goal wouldn\u2019t have counted anyway, because Dunk was bowled over in the middle of a penalty-box melee. Free kick to Brighton. 30 min: McNeil is fine, and he\u2019s soon zipping down the left wing to win a corner with his low cutback intended for Hendrick. 28 min: Brighton respond well, winning a free kick out on the left. There follows a game of head tennis involving Duffy, Dunk, McNeil and Barnes in the box. Then a scramble. Duffy jumps with his arms out, and Duffy hits him on the arm with the Burnley player\u2019s back turned. That should have been a penalty, but Brighton don\u2019t get it, and adding insult to injury, the ref blows for a head injury when McNeil falls to the ground. Pressure off. This had been coming. Barnes, tight on the left touchline, hooks a ball down the channel under pressure. Dunk should clear, but slips and that allows Wood to tear clear on goal! Wood\u2019s not looking this gift horse in the mouth, and sends an unstoppable screamer into the top left. Ryan had no chance of stopping that power drive. But an awful mistake from Dunk. 25 min: Locadia makes good ground down the left and slips a ball across the face of the area to March, who drops a shoulder, cuts inside, and pearls one towards the top left. But Heaton sticks a strong arm up to stop it. The resulting corner comes to nothing. 23 min: A look at the replay of the twin twang of the crossbar suggests Barnes could have done a lot better with his header. It was a pretty good chance; a simple cushioned header into an empty net. He didn\u2019t have to make as much adjustment as I thought, coming straight onto the ball. It qualifies as a bad miss. 21 min: Possession\u2019s been exactly 50-50 so far. But Burnley have done more with their share. The Amex has fallen a little quiet as a result. 19 min: Burnley are beginning to boss this now. Barnes makes good down the left, tearing after another long Tarkowski pass, and whips a glorious first-time cross through the Brighton box. Wood nearly connected at the near post, but didn\u2019t make it, and the danger is over. Wood didn\u2019t totally commit to that; if he\u2019d thrown himself at the cross, he might have been able to bundle that in. 17 min: Burnley hit the woodwork twice in a couple of seconds! McNeil is sent into the Brighton box down the inside-left channel, after a cute Hendrick pass. McNeil shoots low, looking for the bottom right. Duffy, sliding in, deflects the ball up and off the crossbar with a telescopic leg. It drops to Barnes, who tries to cushion a header into the unguarded net from 12 yards, but can\u2019t adjust his body in time. His header brushes the top of the bar and out for a goal kick. 16 min: Westwood hooks a clever improvised pass down the right to release Hendrick into space. Hendrick whistles a cross through the six-yard box, but nobody in Burnley black has taken a gamble, and Ryan watches it through his area and away from danger. 14 min: Tarkowski tries to release Wood down the right with a raking pass from deep. Nope. Too much on that, and it\u2019s a goal kick. But both teams appear to be in the mood to go for the crucial three points in this season\u2019s increasingly unpredictable scrap to avoid the final relegation place. (Let\u2019s face it, Fulham and Huddersfield are gone.) No settling for a point. Not yet, anyway. 12 min: McNeil curls the free kick long and deep. It\u2019s only half cleared by Brighton, and Hendrick, coming in from the right, meets the ball with a fierce low drive. It pinballs away from danger, but that was an extremely sweet strike. He\u2019ll be bemoaning the thicket of players he was forced to shoot through. 11 min: Duffy barges into the back of Barnes, as the pair contest a high ball down the Burnley right. That\u2019s a fairly clumsy challenge, and a free kick to the visitors in a very dangerous position. They load the box. 9 min: Thankfully Bong is soon up and about. He looks a little groggy, but a shake of the head later, he\u2019s cleared to continue. 8 min: Bardsley bombs forward down the inside-right channel. He shows a little bit too much of the ball to Bong, who is able to come in and make a block tackle. But Bardsley is going at full pelt, and the two come together in a sickening but totally accidental and fair clash. Bardsley gets up quickly enough, but Bong is still prone. The ref immediately stops the game. 6 min: Well, this is a bright, open start. Some head tennis in the Burnley box, Gross having hit a diagonal free kick into the mixer from deep on the right. Murray makes a nuisance of himself, and the ball nearly drops to Locadia at the right-hand post. But Taylor sticks a leg out to divert, just as the Brighton man was preparing to tap in. It\u2019s a corner, which comes to nothing. 4 min: Space for Gross down the right. He slams a low cross into the area. It hits Taylor in the seat of his pants, but Gross claims for a penalty kick anyway. He\u2019s not getting it. 3 min: ... Gross chests down, 12 yards out, a little to the right. He creams a rising shot towards the top left. Heaton\u2019s behind this one as well, turning it away from danger! We might get our goalfest after all, if the teams keep this up. 2 min: And now it\u2019s Brighton\u2019s turn to contribute to this fast start. Locadia sends a ball into the Burnley area from the left. March, coming in from the other side, guides a fine header towards the top left. But it\u2019s tipped over by Heaton for a corner. From which ... And we\u2019re off! Burnley get the evening\u2019s entertainment underway. And they immediately win a corner down the right. Tarkowski rises highest to meet it, but the ball only skims off the top of his head and away from danger. Kick-off in a minute. First some warm applause in memory of Emiliano Sala, and then the teams take to the field of play. Brighton in their blue-and-white stripes, Burnley in alternative black. \u201cI have to agree that this fixture doesn\u2019t have Goalfest! written all over it, but fingers crossed Brighton-Burnley burns brightly,\u201d quips Peter Oh, albeit slowly, taking great care over each syllable. Brighton boss Chris Hughton talks to BT Sport! \u201cWe\u2019re on the back of a very good performance against Watford, even if we didn\u2019t get the win we wanted. And it was good to get through in the FA Cup. It\u2019s been a good week. At the moment from an injury point of view we\u2019re in good shape.\u201d Burnley manager Sean Dyche adds! \u201cWe\u2019ve got back to being ourselves. We\u2019ve found a relentlessness in how we play, including a last-minute goal in our last game, and that attitude is growing all the time. But it was unlikely that we\u2019d be up and down all season, I thought we\u2019d come into form at some point, thanks to the work our players do on the training ground. Now it\u2019s about finding and maintaining consistency.\u201d A big result in the 3pm kick-offs. Cardiff City were leading 1-0 at Southampton through a Sol Bamba volley as the game moved into added time. Then Jack Stephens scored with another volley, earning Southampton an equaliser they barely deserved. But it wasn\u2019t over: Kenneth Zohore restored Cardiff\u2019s lead even deeper into injury time, and it ended Saints 1-2 Cardiff. That\u2019s a huge three points for Neil Warnock\u2019s side. It takes them up to 15th spot ... and pushes Burnley into the bottom three. But anything for Burnley in this match will send the Clarets into 15th themselves, knock Cardiff down a spot ... and send Southampton into the bottom three tonight. It\u2019s awfully tight at the bottom. Brighton make one change to the team named in the Premier League last weekend for the goalless draw against Watford. Dale Stephens comes in for Yves Bissouma, who drops to the bench. Burnley are unchanged. It\u2019s the same XI who earned a draw against Southampton last week, with veteran newboy Peter Crouch once again given the role of supersub. Brighton &amp; Hove Albion: Ryan, Montoya, Duffy, Dunk, Bong, Gross, Stephens, Propper, March, Murray, Locadia. Subs: Kayal, Bissouma, Knockaert, Jahanbakhsh, Button, Bernardo, Burn. Burnley: Heaton, Bardsley, Tarkowski, Mee, Taylor, Hendrick, Westwood, Cork, McNeil, Wood, Barnes. Subs: Lowton, Gibson, Crouch, Hart, Ward, Vydra, Long. Referee: Stuart Attwell (Warwickshire). We\u2019ll be straight with you: this fixture does not scream GOALFEST!!! The Seagulls and the Clarets have met each other in the top flight of English football on three previous occasions. The classified scores: 1-0, 0-0, 0-0. And neither team have been banging them in much this season; they\u2019re both scoring at a rate of one a game, give or take a couple of hundredths here and there. You\u2019ll thank me for tempting fate when this ends 4-3. But both sides will nevertheless be in a reasonable state of mind. Brighton have only won once in their last ten Premier League games, but they\u2019ll be buoyed by their fourth-round FA Cup victory over West Bromwich Albion in midweek. Burnley meanwhile were in a little trouble for a while back there, but an unbeaten run of six games in the league, coinciding with Tom Heaton\u2019s return in goal, has extricated them from bottom-three bother. Nobody\u2019s safe from the drop yet, of course. Far from it. Which makes the three points on offer this evening oh-so-precious. Can Brighton notch their first victory since putting away Everton at the Amex over Christmas? Or will Burnley follow up their draw at Manchester United with another big result away from Turf Moor? Will it end 4-3? Or 0-0? Let\u2019s find out. Here\u2019s to a scintillating scrap on the south coast. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 5.30pm GMT.",

      "body": "<p>If nothing else, at least there is a body now. Emiliano Sala\u2019s family can grieve properly. A funeral can take place and, tragic as it is, it has to be better this way rather than finding out it was not him in the wreckage of that plane at the bottom of the English channel. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/07/police-confirm-emiliano-sala-body-pulled-from-plane-wreckage\" title=\"\">At least Sala has been recovered</a> and, as Neil Warnock has said, the family can hopefully find some peace rather than the alternative of him being lost at sea, possibly for ever.</p> \n<p>Not the pilot, though. The family of David Ibbotson may never have that comfort. The search has stopped now and how can anyone even begin to comprehend the kind of shattering grief and stress they must have endured before, during and after the identification process? It was only going to be one of the two. For the friends and family of Sala, the arrangements can be made to repatriate him to Argentina. As for the second person on that Piper PA-46 Malibu, flying from Nantes to Cardiff, nothing so far. Awfully, there is no guarantee that is ever going to change.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/06/nantes-demand-transfer-fee-from-cardiff-city-for-emiliano-sala\">Nantes demand first slice of \u00a315m Emiliano Sala fee from Cardiff</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In these circumstances, perhaps you might have thought the two clubs at the centre of this tragedy would be united in their grief. Was it so unreasonable to think, at the very least, that they could have refrained from falling out over money before Sala\u2019s body had even been brought to the surface? Or that this wasn\u2019t the time to remind everyone what a hard-faced industry football can be sometimes? The sport, as Gareth Southgate once said, that so many of us love when, in reality, there is much to dislike. The sport where, at a certain level, money blurs what is right and wrong far too often.</p> \n<p>If you hadn\u2019t heard already, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/06/nantes-demand-transfer-fee-from-cardiff-city-for-emiliano-sala\" title=\"\">the written demand for Sala\u2019s \u00a315m transfer fee</a> arrived in Cardiff City\u2019s post on Tuesday, including an apparent threat of legal action from Nantes if the money continued to be withheld. Nantes had made it clear in an email the previous Thursday that they had waited long enough. The first bits of wreckage had not even washed up on the shores of Normandy by that stage.</p> \n<p>Yet the message was clear: Nantes wanted the first \u00a35m instalment wiring through as quickly as possible. Cardiff have been warned they face a possible transfer ban from Fifa if they do not cough up the money. And it is grim, to say the least, to see this being played out in public.</p> \n<p>It feels particularly galling when both clubs deserve enormous praise for the touching and sincere way they have handled the tributes. Cardiff\u2019s grief has been raw and genuine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2019/feb/08/a-loss-to-everyone-in-football-neil-warnock-leads-tributes-to-emiliano-sala-video\" title=\"\">and Warnock, in particular</a>, has shown there are different layers to his personality. Away from the caricature, Cardiff\u2019s manager is not always \u201cslamming\u201d or \u201cblasting\u201d. There is a soft-focus Warnock and we have seen that side to him, more than ever before, since Sala\u2019s plane went down on 21 January.</p> \n<p>Nantes, too. Maybe you saw the television pictures of that beautifully choreographed tribute when <em>Les Canaris </em>played Saint-\u00c9tienne at the Stade de la Beaujoire, when the game was paused in the ninth minute (signifying Sala\u2019s shirt number), the fans held up thousands of yellow and green cards to create a mosaic of his name and the moment, when play restarted, that the coach, Vahid Halilhodzic, took his seat again and could not hold back his emotion any longer.</p> \n<p>Halilhodzic\u2019s association with Nantes goes back to 1981, as a player, when he used to wear that No 9 shirt himself. Now 66, he let it all out, weeping into his fist.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5f213c3a-917d-4545-8a8c-cee09ae034f4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3UnGf_4Yg78?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Those images will stay in the memory: something pure, untainted and so much more fitting than the subplot of two clubs squabbling over money. Nantes, who did not even wait for Sala\u2019s body to be identified before firing off their invoice. And Cardiff, deciding it would be a good idea to corroborate the details with <em>L\u2019\u00c9quipe</em>, of all the publications.</p> \n<p>Cardiff are \u201cshocked\u201d, apparently, and perhaps that is genuine. But why publicise it? Why say anything when it was obvious it would create a terrible stink? Unless, of course, it is a tactic on Cardiff\u2019s part and, without wishing to sound too cynical, there is actually more to this than meets the eye.

Sure, there was always the potential that it might get a bit complicated further down the line, especially when Bordeaux are due 50% via a sell-on clause and there are so many agents with their fingers in the pie. But this quickly? I mean, did it really have to be this way?</p> \n<p>The explanation from France is that it is an expensive business running a football club in Ligue 1 and, well, of course they want what is owed, especially when they have designs for a swish new stadium.

      "bodyText": "If nothing else, at least there is a body now. Emiliano Sala\u2019s family can grieve properly. A funeral can take place and, tragic as it is, it has to be better this way rather than finding out it was not him in the wreckage of that plane at the bottom of the English channel. At least Sala has been recovered and, as Neil Warnock has said, the family can hopefully find some peace rather than the alternative of him being lost at sea, possibly for ever. Not the pilot, though. The family of David Ibbotson may never have that comfort. The search has stopped now and how can anyone even begin to comprehend the kind of shattering grief and stress they must have endured before, during and after the identification process? It was only going to be one of the two. For the friends and family of Sala, the arrangements can be made to repatriate him to Argentina. As for the second person on that Piper PA-46 Malibu, flying from Nantes to Cardiff, nothing so far. Awfully, there is no guarantee that is ever going to change. In these circumstances, perhaps you might have thought the two clubs at the centre of this tragedy would be united in their grief. Was it so unreasonable to think, at the very least, that they could have refrained from falling out over money before Sala\u2019s body had even been brought to the surface? Or that this wasn\u2019t the time to remind everyone what a hard-faced industry football can be sometimes? The sport, as Gareth Southgate once said, that so many of us love when, in reality, there is much to dislike. The sport where, at a certain level, money blurs what is right and wrong far too often. If you hadn\u2019t heard already, the written demand for Sala\u2019s \u00a315m transfer fee arrived in Cardiff City\u2019s post on Tuesday, including an apparent threat of legal action from Nantes if the money continued to be withheld. Nantes had made it clear in an email the previous Thursday that they had waited long enough. The first bits of wreckage had not even washed up on the shores of Normandy by that stage. Yet the message was clear: Nantes wanted the first \u00a35m instalment wiring through as quickly as possible. Cardiff have been warned they face a possible transfer ban from Fifa if they do not cough up the money. And it is grim, to say the least, to see this being played out in public. It feels particularly galling when both clubs deserve enormous praise for the touching and sincere way they have handled the tributes. Cardiff\u2019s grief has been raw and genuine and Warnock, in particular, has shown there are different layers to his personality. Away from the caricature, Cardiff\u2019s manager is not always \u201cslamming\u201d or \u201cblasting\u201d. There is a soft-focus Warnock and we have seen that side to him, more than ever before, since Sala\u2019s plane went down on 21 January. Nantes, too. Maybe you saw the television pictures of that beautifully choreographed tribute when Les Canaris played Saint-\u00c9tienne at the Stade de la Beaujoire, when the game was paused in the ninth minute (signifying Sala\u2019s shirt number), the fans held up thousands of yellow and green cards to create a mosaic of his name and the moment, when play restarted, that the coach, Vahid Halilhodzic, took his seat again and could not hold back his emotion any longer. Halilhodzic\u2019s association with Nantes goes back to 1981, as a player, when he used to wear that No 9 shirt himself. Now 66, he let it all out, weeping into his fist. Those images will stay in the memory: something pure, untainted and so much more fitting than the subplot of two clubs squabbling over money. Nantes, who did not even wait for Sala\u2019s body to be identified before firing off their invoice. And Cardiff, deciding it would be a good idea to corroborate the details with L\u2019\u00c9quipe, of all the publications. Cardiff are \u201cshocked\u201d, apparently, and perhaps that is genuine. But why publicise it? Why say anything when it was obvious it would create a terrible stink? Unless, of course, it is a tactic on Cardiff\u2019s part and, without wishing to sound too cynical, there is actually more to this than meets the eye. Because somehow I don\u2019t imagine the initial leak, to the football desk of BBC Wales, originated from France. Unfortunately, it is difficult not to be cynical after watching this story unfold, with all the various agents wanting their cut (five at the last count, plus others hovering on the edges), the particularly impressive efforts of one of these middle men, the reliably noxious Willie McKay, to remind us of Joe Kinnear\u2019s tribute to that particular world (\u201cdogs, worms, vermin\u201d), the standoff between the two clubs and what the latest disclosures tell us about the transfer market in modern-day football. None of it being attractive whatsoever.

No, if you had not been a footballer these people would not be interested in you. No sentiment, we\u2019re just doing business.\u201d Perhaps, in hindsight, Kinnear was being too kind.

      "body": "<p>Donald Tusk has it in him to be a bit of a hooligan. His younger self, he admits, would \u201croam the streets cruising for a bruising\u201d to break the monotony of communist life in his home-town of Gda\u0144sk, the port city on Poland\u2019s Baltic coast.</p> <p>Contrary to the image of the typical bloodless Brussels Eurocrat, the president of the European council, who stands alongside Jean-Claude Juncker as the most senior of EU figures, is a man of passion with a feel for who is on the right side of history. Last week it was frustration, not boredom, that brought out the inner wrecking ball.</p> <p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d said Tusk, at a press conference in Brussels with the Irish PM, Leo Varadkar. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/06/donald-tusk-special-place-in-hell-for-those-who-backed-brexit-without-plan\" title=\"\">that special place in hell</a> looks like, for those who promoted Brexit, without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely. Thank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey will give you terrible trouble in the British press for that,\u201d muttered Varadkar as the two men shook hands. \u201cI know, I know,\u201d Tusk responded, and smiled.</p> <p>Donald Franciszek Tusk was born in April 1957 to a Kashubian family, a west Slavic ethnic minority of 300,000 people whose loyalty was neither trusted by the Nazis when they invaded Gda\u0144sk, nor later Stalin.</p> <p>His maternal grandmother was German, yet he grew up with tales of his relatives being taken to Nazi labour camps. The Russians were the liberators who didn\u2019t leave, imposing a life of grinding tedium and poverty. Tusk learned to appreciate Europe\u2019s complexity early.</p> <p>When Tusk was 14, with his carpenter father in the grip of terminal illness, the Polish people rose up. He watched from the family home as the police and army opened fire on the protesters, public buildings burned and tanks rolled on to the blood-stained streets. Tusk was left with the opinion that those who are beaten are often the ones in the right.</p> <p>He has described his late father as \u201cvery strict, a strong person, if you know what I mean\u201d, and his mother, Ewa, who died in 2009, as \u201cpure goodness\u201d. But young Donald was headstrong, first running with the local football hooligans, and then in 1976 at the university of Gda\u0144sk with the students rising up around the anti-communist trade union Solidarno\u015b\u0107, or Solidarity.</p> <p>His first paid job was as a journalist for a Solidarity publication but he was forced into hiding with his pregnant wife Ma\u0142gorzata in 1981 when the Moscow-backed leader General Wojciech Jaruzelski brought in martial law. Work was found as a bread seller and later as a labourer specialising in high altitudes with the aid of climbing equipment. The political activism continued for which he was arrested and briefly imprisoned. Fortunately, three days after being taken the regime announced an amnesty for political prisoners as it struggled to keep its grip.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f457b9607f8c334dc22d7dc335064b817ee961d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f457b9607f8c334dc22d7dc335064b817ee961d/0_29_2952_1772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"British Prime Minister Theresa May (L) and President of the European Council Donald Tusk (R) pose for a photo ahead of their meeting in Brussels, Belgium on February 07, 201\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Tusk meeting prime minister Theresa May in Brussels last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the time of the collapse of communism in Poland, Tusk was the co-founder of the illegal monthly <em>Political Review</em>, propagating economic liberalism and liberal democracy. It would be the basis for his political career, initially as leader of a free-market pro-Europe party, the Liberal Democratic Congress, and then a key player in the centrist Civic Platform, as head of which he was that led to him becoming Polish prime minister from 2007 for a record seven years, during which the country enjoyed a period of unrivalled economic growth.</p> <p>But his success earned him enemies, not least Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, leader of the now ruling right-wing nationalist Law and Justice party, whose poisonous personal grudge still dogs Tusk at home. Kaczy\u0144ski holds him responsible for a plane crash on 10 April 2010 that killed his brother, the then Polish president, Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, a claim Tusk has dismissed as obviously politically motivated.</p> <p>Tusk had run out of road at home. It was with the backing of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel that he was appointed by the 28 member states as president of the European council in 2014, a mediating, compromise-finding, role with a monthly salary of \u20ac32,200 (\u00a328,180).</p> <p>The contrast with the previous president, the former prime minister of Belgium, Herman van Rompuy, has proven stark. Rompuy, a Haiku lover known as \u201cthe Belgian submarine\u201d for his understated style, brought a technical economist\u2019s eye to a crisis. Tusk, a keen user of Instagram and Twitter, on the encouragement of his daughter, Katarzyna, brings an eye for the global picture. And, despite his relaxed style in his office, where he often dispenses with suit and tie, he has a firm belief in the need at times to apply some muscle.</p> <p>In July 2015, Merkel and the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, could see no way through after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/12/greek-debt-crisis-eu-leaders-meeting-cancelled-no-deal-live\" title=\"\">14 hours of talks</a> over the crisis that looked set to end in Grexit. \u201cSorry, but there is no way you are leaving this room,\u201d Tusk told them.</p> <p>The past five years have seen Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea, the migration crisis and the rise of Donald Trump, of whom Tusk has been an outspoken critic.

      "bodyText": "Donald Tusk has it in him to be a bit of a hooligan. His younger self, he admits, would \u201croam the streets cruising for a bruising\u201d to break the monotony of communist life in his home-town of Gda\u0144sk, the port city on Poland\u2019s Baltic coast. Contrary to the image of the typical bloodless Brussels Eurocrat, the president of the European council, who stands alongside Jean-Claude Juncker as the most senior of EU figures, is a man of passion with a feel for who is on the right side of history. Last week it was frustration, not boredom, that brought out the inner wrecking ball. \u201cBy the way,\u201d said Tusk, at a press conference in Brussels with the Irish PM, Leo Varadkar. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering what that special place in hell looks like, for those who promoted Brexit, without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely. Thank you.\u201d \u201cThey will give you terrible trouble in the British press for that,\u201d muttered Varadkar as the two men shook hands. \u201cI know, I know,\u201d Tusk responded, and smiled. Donald Franciszek Tusk was born in April 1957 to a Kashubian family, a west Slavic ethnic minority of 300,000 people whose loyalty was neither trusted by the Nazis when they invaded Gda\u0144sk, nor later Stalin. His maternal grandmother was German, yet he grew up with tales of his relatives being taken to Nazi labour camps. The Russians were the liberators who didn\u2019t leave, imposing a life of grinding tedium and poverty. Tusk learned to appreciate Europe\u2019s complexity early. When Tusk was 14, with his carpenter father in the grip of terminal illness, the Polish people rose up. He watched from the family home as the police and army opened fire on the protesters, public buildings burned and tanks rolled on to the blood-stained streets. Tusk was left with the opinion that those who are beaten are often the ones in the right. He has described his late father as \u201cvery strict, a strong person, if you know what I mean\u201d, and his mother, Ewa, who died in 2009, as \u201cpure goodness\u201d. But young Donald was headstrong, first running with the local football hooligans, and then in 1976 at the university of Gda\u0144sk with the students rising up around the anti-communist trade union Solidarno\u015b\u0107, or Solidarity. His first paid job was as a journalist for a Solidarity publication but he was forced into hiding with his pregnant wife Ma\u0142gorzata in 1981 when the Moscow-backed leader General Wojciech Jaruzelski brought in martial law. Work was found as a bread seller and later as a labourer specialising in high altitudes with the aid of climbing equipment. The political activism continued for which he was arrested and briefly imprisoned. Fortunately, three days after being taken the regime announced an amnesty for political prisoners as it struggled to keep its grip. At the time of the collapse of communism in Poland, Tusk was the co-founder of the illegal monthly Political Review, propagating economic liberalism and liberal democracy. It would be the basis for his political career, initially as leader of a free-market pro-Europe party, the Liberal Democratic Congress, and then a key player in the centrist Civic Platform, as head of which he was that led to him becoming Polish prime minister from 2007 for a record seven years, during which the country enjoyed a period of unrivalled economic growth. But his success earned him enemies, not least Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, leader of the now ruling right-wing nationalist Law and Justice party, whose poisonous personal grudge still dogs Tusk at home. Kaczy\u0144ski holds him responsible for a plane crash on 10 April 2010 that killed his brother, the then Polish president, Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, a claim Tusk has dismissed as obviously politically motivated. Tusk had run out of road at home. It was with the backing of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel that he was appointed by the 28 member states as president of the European council in 2014, a mediating, compromise-finding, role with a monthly salary of \u20ac32,200 (\u00a328,180). The contrast with the previous president, the former prime minister of Belgium, Herman van Rompuy, has proven stark. Rompuy, a Haiku lover known as \u201cthe Belgian submarine\u201d for his understated style, brought a technical economist\u2019s eye to a crisis. Tusk, a keen user of Instagram and Twitter, on the encouragement of his daughter, Katarzyna, brings an eye for the global picture. And, despite his relaxed style in his office, where he often dispenses with suit and tie, he has a firm belief in the need at times to apply some muscle. In July 2015, Merkel and the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, could see no way through after 14 hours of talks over the crisis that looked set to end in Grexit. \u201cSorry, but there is no way you are leaving this room,\u201d Tusk told them. The past five years have seen Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea, the migration crisis and the rise of Donald Trump, of whom Tusk has been an outspoken critic. But it will be Brexit that surely defines the Tusk legacy. As an aide says: \u201cFor him, Brexit is a catastrophic breach of the liberal democratic order that he fought for as a young man, an unravelling of everything he believes in.\u201d Not everyone in Brussels is convinced the comments last week were wise. But, confronted by May on Thursday, Tusk did not budge: \u201cHe remains of the view that while the truth may be more painful, it is always more useful\u201d.",

Where hip-hop has become mainstream and gentrified, drill is raw and nihilistic, its lyrics overflowing with anger and violence.</p> <p>For many in authority, the violence of the music is inseparable from gang violence. Certainly, some drill artists have been involved not just in gangs but in murderous acts, including the killing of 15-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/15/three-jailed-stabbing-teenager-south-london-jermaine-goupall\" title=\"\">Jermaine Goupall</a> in south London. Supporters of drill argue that the lyrics simply reflect the reality of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/06/dont-censor-drill-music-listen-skengdo-am\" title=\"\">life in many urban communities</a>.</p> <p>There is a long history of moral panics about music. From jazz to rock\u2019n\u2019roll to punk to hip-hop, popular music has often been portrayed as morally depraved. But while previously records have been banned and clubs shut down, Skengdo and AM are the first musicians in Britain to have received prison sentences (albeit suspended) for playing a particular song.</p> <p>According to Cressida Dick, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, drill music is about \u201cglamorising serious violence\u201d, with lyrics that describe \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/nick-ferrari/met-police-chief-calls-on-youtube-drill-music/\" title=\"\">stabbings in great detail, joy and excitement</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Glamorising violence is not, however, a criminal offence. If it were, everything from <em>American Psycho</em> to <em>Zulu</em> could be banned.</p> <p>One can have a moral debate about how musicians should deal with the issue of violence. It\u2019s not, though, the job of the police to set the terms of that debate, nor to frame our moral attitudes. The police claim also that drill \u201cincites\u201d violence. Incitement to violence is illegal in this country. Neither Skengdo nor AM has been charged under those laws. Instead, the Met has creatively redefined what it means legally to incite. Last year, Met commander <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/police-to-treat-gangs-like-terror-suspects-7zms8gsmr\" title=\"\">Jim Stokley told the <em>Times</em></a> that \u201cnew measures would mean officers no longer needed to prove that videos and social media posts were linked to specific acts of violence to secure a conviction for incitement to violence\u201d.</p> <p>In other words, you can be guilty of incitement even if you haven\u2019t incited a specific violent act. The injunction against Skengdo and AM forbids them from mentioning death, injury or rival crews in their songs. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/15/london-drill-rap-gang-banned-from-making-music-due-to-threat-of-violence\" title=\"\">Other groups, such as 1011</a>, have been served with similar injunctions.</p> <p>The police clampdown reveals the increasing use of administrative sanctions as a means of bypassing the judicial process. The injunctions against Skengdo and AM were imposed through a criminal behaviour order (CBO), the updated version of the antisocial behaviour orders, or Asbos, introduced in 1998 by Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government. Skengdo and AM were served with an injunction without having been convicted of a crime. Breaking the injunction is a criminal offence. They\u2019ve been criminalised for making violent music without having been convicted of any offence of violence.</p> <p>Gang violence is an important and fraught issue, especially in London. Few would deny that music-driven clashes in the drill world often relate to real-life conflict. But the roots of gang violence are complex, and afford no easy solutions. There is no evidence that drill music causes gang violence. The authorities, though, want to be seen to be doing something. So they\u2019ve turned drill musicians into scapegoats and criminalised music in a policy low in effectiveness but high in visibility.</p> <p>The attempt by the police to redefine \u201cincitement\u201d and the willingness of the courts to potentially imprison musicians for performing \u201cunacceptable\u201d songs are assaults on basic liberties. Music writers, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/31/skengdo-and-am-the-drill-rappers-sentenced-for-playing-their-song\" title=\"\">Dan Hancox</a>, and free speech organisations, including <a href=\"https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2018/06/kill-drill-the-death-of-freedom-of-expression/\" title=\"\">Index on Censorship</a>, have raised the alarm, yet there is a striking lack of wider concern about these trends.</p> <p>Many on the left have become so supportive of censorship that they barely notice. Many on the right who often holler about free speech violations remain silent about the censorship of marginalised black musicians. And so the police and courts continue to hack away at our liberties.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

Drill is a form of rap that emerged in Chicago\u2019s South Side in the early 2010s and subsequently found a home in south London, too. Where hip-hop has become mainstream and gentrified, drill is raw and nihilistic, its lyrics overflowing with anger and violence. For many in authority, the violence of the music is inseparable from gang violence. Certainly, some drill artists have been involved not just in gangs but in murderous acts, including the killing of 15-year-old Jermaine Goupall in south London. Supporters of drill argue that the lyrics simply reflect the reality of life in many urban communities. There is a long history of moral panics about music. From jazz to rock\u2019n\u2019roll to punk to hip-hop, popular music has often been portrayed as morally depraved. But while previously records have been banned and clubs shut down, Skengdo and AM are the first musicians in Britain to have received prison sentences (albeit suspended) for playing a particular song. According to Cressida Dick, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, drill music is about \u201cglamorising serious violence\u201d, with lyrics that describe \u201cstabbings in great detail, joy and excitement\u201d. Glamorising violence is not, however, a criminal offence. If it were, everything from American Psycho to Zulu could be banned. One can have a moral debate about how musicians should deal with the issue of violence. It\u2019s not, though, the job of the police to set the terms of that debate, nor to frame our moral attitudes. The police claim also that drill \u201cincites\u201d violence. Incitement to violence is illegal in this country. Neither Skengdo nor AM has been charged under those laws. Instead, the Met has creatively redefined what it means legally to incite. Last year, Met commander Jim Stokley told the Times that \u201cnew measures would mean officers no longer needed to prove that videos and social media posts were linked to specific acts of violence to secure a conviction for incitement to violence\u201d. In other words, you can be guilty of incitement even if you haven\u2019t incited a specific violent act. The injunction against Skengdo and AM forbids them from mentioning death, injury or rival crews in their songs. Other groups, such as 1011, have been served with similar injunctions. The police clampdown reveals the increasing use of administrative sanctions as a means of bypassing the judicial process. The injunctions against Skengdo and AM were imposed through a criminal behaviour order (CBO), the updated version of the antisocial behaviour orders, or Asbos, introduced in 1998 by Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government. Skengdo and AM were served with an injunction without having been convicted of a crime. Breaking the injunction is a criminal offence. They\u2019ve been criminalised for making violent music without having been convicted of any offence of violence. Gang violence is an important and fraught issue, especially in London. Few would deny that music-driven clashes in the drill world often relate to real-life conflict. But the roots of gang violence are complex, and afford no easy solutions. There is no evidence that drill music causes gang violence. The authorities, though, want to be seen to be doing something. So they\u2019ve turned drill musicians into scapegoats and criminalised music in a policy low in effectiveness but high in visibility. The attempt by the police to redefine \u201cincitement\u201d and the willingness of the courts to potentially imprison musicians for performing \u201cunacceptable\u201d songs are assaults on basic liberties. Music writers, such as Dan Hancox, and free speech organisations, including Index on Censorship, have raised the alarm, yet there is a striking lack of wider concern about these trends. Many on the left have become so supportive of censorship that they barely notice. Many on the right who often holler about free speech violations remain silent about the censorship of marginalised black musicians. And so the police and courts continue to hack away at our liberties. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "OK, time to head for the ice bath. Thanks for joining me, and goodnight. I\u2019ll leave you with our match report: Here\u2019s Warren G: \u201cThere\u2019s definitely things we need to work on. Our lineouts were poor again, and if we play like that against England, it could be embarrasing. We won\u2019t play like that, though\u201d, he adds with a wry smile. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have as much momentum and tempo as we would have liked, but we\u2019re looking at the Six Nations and trying to build for the World Cup.\u201d Wales are top of the Six Nations table, but they didn\u2019t pick up a bonus point here. Might that cost them later in the tournament? Perhaps, but with all those changes, Gatland appeared happy to take that risk in order to give players some extra game time. Jonathan Davies, captaining Wales for the first time tonight, says his team are \u201cfrustrated\u201d by their performance, but praises the efforts of the debutants and fringe players who came in. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to be much better against England\u201d, he adds, and he is not wrong. That\u2019s it! Wales have an 11th consecutive win, and their second away success in this year\u2019s Six Nations. It was far from pretty, and they struggled until Warren Gatland called key men off the bench to dash growing Italian hopes of a shock victory. NO TRY! Prop Dillon Lewis bustles through from Anscombe\u2019s offload, and Thomas Young crosses into the corner. It\u2019s ruled out - Anscombe\u2019s pass was forward - but that\u2019s harsh on Young, denied his first Wales try. 78 mins: Josh Navidi is named man of the match for a battling performance at No 8. The try count is 2-2, Dan Biggar\u2019s four penalties in the first half-hour proving crucial. Without them, Italy would be a point ahead. Wales leave a gap in their defence and Italy exploit it, Allan sidestepping into space and teeing up Padovani, who cruises into the corner. Allan shanks a tricky conversion wide. 73 mins: More sterling work from Steyn and Parisse carries Italy upfield. If only Italy\u2019s entire team was as strong as their back row. The hosts have a scrum, and a chance to make the scoreline look more respectable... \u201cItaly may have Bigi but what we have is Biggar,\u201d says Phil Grey, picking up the pun that\u2019s been staring at me all game. As I type those fateful words, Anscombe cuts Italy open with a delicate chip beyond the line - and Owen Watkin is onto it ahead of Morisi. Anscombe converts, and Wales have wrapped up the win! 69 mins: Wales pick up another penalty, and then an advantage close to the Italian line. It\u2019s all a little uninspired though ... 67 mins: More changes for Wales, with Elias, Amos and Ross Moriarty coming on. That means that Wales have Holmes and Moriarty on the field together. Elementary. NO TRY! Due to technical issues, we haven\u2019t been able to hear the referee throughout the game, and he can\u2019t communicate directly with the TMO, either. After a bit of back and forth, we learn that in the booth, a knock on was picked up. 64 mins: Wales pounce on an Italian mistake as the ball squirms away from Jayden Hayward, as he tries to pick up a grubber kick. Adams and Jonathan Davies are both onto it in a flash, the latter grounding the ball. It\u2019ll be reviewed for a potential knock on... 62 mins: Allan has returned after his head injury assessment. A crafty banana kick from Anscombe sets up an Italy lineout, as Wyn Jones and Gareth Davies come on. 60 mins: Italy make two more front-row changes, with Bigi and Pasquali replacing Ferrari and Ghiraldini. Scrum-half Edoardo Gori is also on, replacing Pazzani. 59 mins: Italy snatch the lineout ball - that area continues to pose problems for Wales. The visitors go again, but Williams\u2019 attempted grubber kick is straight into an Italian shin. 57 mins: More Italy changes, with Marco Barbini on for Negri, and a couple more lined up. Traore is penalised for not rolling away, and Wales will have a dangerous lineout... Dan Biggar adds the conversion, taking his total to 14 on a mixed night for him, before heading off as Gareth Anscombe comes on. Wales get the breathing space they needed! Davies leads the drive and Italy are short of numbers on their right. Liam Williams gets through a half-hearted Hayward tackle, and offloads to Josh Adams, who races in and dots down under the posts. 53 mins: Federico Ruzza is on for Dean Budd in the Italian pack. I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t start today; he was terrific when coming on at Murrayfield. 52 mins: Biggar has amassed all of Wales\u2019s points but some of his kicking has been erratic, and he looks annoyed with himself as he plants an effort straight into touch. He hasn\u2019t helped his claims for a World Cup starting spot today. 51 mins: Changes for both sides. Wales call on their captain, Alun Wyn Jones, who replaces Jake Ball. In the front row, Dillon Lewis replaces Samson Lee. For Italy, Cherif Traore is on, replacing Nicola Quaglio. 50 mins: The game opening up a little bit, Biggar leading a charge before Italy turn it over, McKinley kicking downfield and forcing Williams to gather smartly under pressure. 48 mins: Ian McKinley comes on, with Tommaso Allan requiring a head injury assessment. If you\u2019re wondering why he\u2019s wearing goggles, he has lost sight in one eye after a horrific injury: 46 mins: Yikes, Aled Davies can\u2019t clear the ball out of the maul, and Braam Steyn turns the ball over! The clearing kick is poor, and Wales have a lineout - but Steyn is on hand again. 45 mins: The penalties keep piling up, Dean Budd penalised for a high tackle. Biggar backs himself to kick into the corner, and does so clinically. Welsh lineout, five metres out... Thomas Young tried to sneak in and steal the ball, but the ruck had formed and the risk didn\u2019t pay off. Allan atones for his miss before half time. Is it time for Wales to make changes? 42 mins: Biggar misjudges his kick to touch, and Italy have a lineout. Wales penalised for an offside, and Italy can pick up where they left off... The second half is under way. For your consideration Take your pick for some half-time reading. He\u2019s hit the post! It wasn\u2019t a gimme, but ... oh, Italy. A scrappy half ends with Wales relieved to still have a five-point cushion. 40 mins: Italy have a lineout from Allan\u2019s penalty kick, and get another penalty as Beard gets underneath Negri and tips him. Wales have lost their discipline here, and Allan can cut the gap before half time... 38 mins: Parisse swats the ball away at a Welsh lineout, and Beard and Dee exchange words afterwards. It\u2019s not quite clicking for Wales at set-pieces - and from the scrum, Wales collapse, Nicky Smith at fault. 36 mins: This game had an all too familiar feeling to it for Italy - down 12 points, all from penalties, in an otherwise even contest. Now they\u2019ve got something to show for their endeavour, and Wales have to be a bit more aggressive. Braam Steyn, backed up by Dave Sisi, powers over the line as Wales run out of bodies behind the ball. Allan converts, sneaking his effort inside the far post. Italy back in this! 33 mins: Dean Budd claims the lineout ball and offloads to Parisse. Wales stall the maul, but Italy keep pushing, Negri crashing through the Welsh defence twice. They look to have the momentum here... 32 mins: A poor kick from Josh Adams allows Italy another opportunity to attack, but there\u2019s no way through. Wales eventually concede a penalty though, and Allan turns down the chance to get three points on the board, kicking for the corner instead. Another straightforward three points for Biggar, who slices his kick but still sends it through the posts. 28 mins: Italy repel the attack from their own five-metre line, helped by Welsh indecision. Campagnaro strips the ball - but Italy had strayed offside previously. 26 mins: They can, and in some style, Biggar bravely grabbing a high ball from Aled Davies cleanly under pressure. He takes Wales within 10 metres, with Italy scrambling to get men back... 25 mins: Another Italian attack ends as Thomas Young rips the ball loose. Can Wales forge an attack of their own? 23 mins: Wales stand up to an Italian maul, and get the turnover. No joy for the hosts, who stay scoreless. 21 mins: Wales concede a penalty, Nicky Smith going in off his feet at the breakdown. The visitors turn the ball over but Italy snatch it back, Padovani taking a big catch from Biggar\u2019s kick and hurting himself in the process. Italy edging into the Welsh 22... Nicely done, drilled between the posts from distance. Wales a long way from top gear, but with a healthy lead. 16 mins: Biggar chips and charges, almost collecting his own kick with Italy already penalised for offside. It doesn\u2019t quite come off, but it\u2019s a fourth penalty conceded by the hosts. Biggar will kick from 46 metres out... Italy have held firm in open play but are always vulnerable at set pieces, and after their scrum folds, Wales have the chance to add three easy points, which Dan Biggar accepts. 11 mins: ITV co-comm David Flatman just described Samson Lee as \u201ca cannonball with eyes\u201d. It was meant as a compliment, I think. 10 mins: The Welsh backs are strung out across the field as Aled Davies collects from the scrum. The hosts are defending stoutly, and Beard spills the ball under pressure from Quaglio. 8 mins: After a couple of nervous moments, a chance for this makeshift Wales team to push forward. From an Italy line-out, Parisse collects - but Italy are penalised, and Wales have a scrum, some 10 metres out. 4 mins: Italy respond well to that early setback, with Liam Williams forced to claim an Esposito kick-through under pressure after a quick turnover. Italy come again, full-back Jayden Hayward making ground before a loose pass to Esposito. Tommaso Allan tries to rebuild the momentum, but Wales stand firm and get the put-in at the scrum. Barely 60 seconds in, and Italy concede a penalty underneath their own posts after good work from debutant Thomas Young and hooker Elliot Dee. Yikes. Biggar does the necessary, and Wales lead. After a bit of unexplained faffing, Dan Biggar kicks things off. A decent crowd inside the cavernous Stadio Olimpico, as the players line up for the anthems. Two absolute belters, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree. So, only two teams can win the grand slam now - Wales and England. They meet in two weeks\u2019 time, in Cardiff, in what should be a half-decent game - providing both teams get the job done this weekend. Here\u2019s Paul Rees\u2019 match report from Murrayfield: Warren Gatland speaks! \u201cWe\u2019ve been in Europe, enjoying a break, the weather\u2019s been nice\u201d he says, as ITV cuts to footage of Welsh players frolicking in the Med. He adds that this is a chance for Dan Biggar to impress at fly-half from the start, after doing well from the bench in recent games. Ireland have beaten Scotland 22-13 at Murrayfield, after a first half that was excellent, and a second half that was less so. Pre-game reading Hello! I\u2019m currently covering the closing stages of Scotland v Ireland. Feel free to join me, or just mooch around here. I\u2019m easy. Italy: Jayden Hayward; Edoardo Padovani, Michele Campagnaro, Luca Morisi, Angelo Esposito; Tommaso Allan, Guglielmo Palazzani; Nicola Quaglio, Leonardo Ghiraldini, Simone Ferrari; Dave Sisi, Dean Budd; Sebastian Negri, Braam Steyn, Sergio Parisse. Replacements: Luca Bigi, Cherif Traore, Tiziano Pasquali, Federico Ruzza, Marco Barbini, Edoardo Gori, Ian McKinley, Tommaso Benvenuti. Wales: Liam Williams; Jonah Holmes, Jonathan Davies, Owen Watkin, Josh Adams; Dan Biggar, Aled Davies; Nicky Smith, Elliot Dee, Samson Lee; Jake Ball, Adam Beard; Aaron Wainwright, Thomas Young, Josh Navidi. Replacements: Ryan Elias, Wyn Jones, Dillon Lewis, Alun Wyn Jones, Ross Moriarty, Gareth Davies, Gareth Anscombe, Hallam Amos. This year\u2019s Six Nations schedule is shaping up nicely for Wales. A Friday night opener in Paris is followed by what ought to be a Saturday stroll in Rome, as their rivals battle in storm-lashed Britain. Warren Gatland\u2019s men even spent the week in Nice; we can only hope they got their trotters up at some point. As long as a first defeat to Italy for 12 years is avoided, Wales should be suitably refreshed and rotated before England come to Cardiff. Even at this early stage, that game already has the look of a potential slam eliminator. With that contest, and the World Cup, in mind, Warren Gatland is testing out fringe players here, seeking assurances on the depth of his squad. Gatland may have one eye on the future, but his players must keep Paris in mind too. Wales summoned a record comeback after a dreadful first half there, and will need to stay focused at a venue where they were behind at the break on their last visit. Italy\u2019s three late tries at Murrayfield showed the dangers of switching off against them, and there\u2019s history at stake too, as Wales chase a record-equalling 11th straight victory. In short, the holiday\u2019s over.",

      "bodyText": "Last Tuesday morning Tim Steiner, the boss of Ocado, was brimming with his usual confidence as he told City investors how its robotic warehouses had the potential to revolutionise grocery shopping and transform the way baggage carousels, car parks and even ports operate. However, as Steiner was delivering his presentation in Goldman Sachs\u2019s London office \u2013 where he worked as a bond trader in the 1990s \u2013 about 70 miles to the west a key element of the Ocado operation was literally about to go up in smoke. In the early hours of that day, a fire had broken out in his company\u2019s flagship warehouse in Andover, Hampshire. The savage blaze burned for 48 hours, required 200 firefighters to bring it under control, and reduced the \u00a345m building to a twisted, smouldering hulk. Ocado had to abandon the 4,000-plus deliveries that usually leave the Andover depot daily in its distinctive food-emblazoned vans; but the fire has done more than spoil the Sunday lunch plans of customers in nearby Winchester and Salisbury. Although Ocado\u2019s share price had recovered by Friday, the middle of last week saw more than \u00a31bn wiped off the stock market value of the retail-turned-tech firm. Investors worried that retailers, who have been queuing to buy its automated warehouse technology, would take fright at the vulnerability the fire had exposed. \u201cOcado is a remarkable business that has led a charmed life,\u201d says Shore Capital analyst Clive Black, who prior to last week\u2019s setback was sceptical about a business that has ploughed vast sums into a series of hi-tech warehouses without delivering meaningful profits for investors. Andover was not just any old warehouse; it was the prototype for Ocado\u2019s robotic dream. Footage released when the building opened in 2016 showed an army of 600 robots swarming over a 3D frame called the \u201cgrid\u201d to locate goods, from tins of baked beans to toilet rolls. Travelling at up to four metres a second, the robots allow a typical order to be filled in around five minutes. The Andover warehouse is the third iteration of the company\u2019s thinking. While its first two \u2013 in Hatfield, Hertfordshire and Dordon, Warwickshire \u2013 relied on humans to load crates that sped by on conveyors, in Andover robots took centre stage in an automated warehouse system it marketed to retailers around the world as the Ocado Smart Platform. After nearly a decade as an unloved listed company, Ocado was propelled into the FTSE 100 last year after Steiner finally sold this grocery-picking expertise to several foreign retail chains. One blockbuster deal is to build 20 warehouses for US supermarket giant Kroger. From presiding over the UK\u2019s most shorted stock \u2013 where investors bet on a share price falling \u2013 Steiner found himself running the newly crowned \u201cMicrosoft of retail\u201d. The euphoria saw Ocado shares rise to \u00a311.63, valuing the business at more than \u00a38bn and earning Steiner, who owns a 3.4% stake, a place in the annual Sunday Times rich list. Steiner founded Ocado with Goldman Sachs colleagues Jonathan Faiman and Jason Gissing in 2000, but is the only one to have stayed the turbulent course. Before last week\u2019s disaster, he also had the tantalising prospect of another coup, with news that Ocado was in talks with Marks &amp; Spencer, which has yet to commit to selling food online. \u201cThe whole point of the smart platform is that it is more agile, and Andover is the centrepiece of that,\u201d says Black, adding that there had been doubts over whether the technology driving the operation would ever be a lucrative seller in its own right.

      "bodyText": "Japan is seeking tougher concessions from Britain in trade talks than it secured from the EU, while negotiations between London and Tokyo are also being slowed by the looming risk of no-deal Brexit. Japanese trade negotiators are confident they can extract better terms, the Financial Times reported, in a sign of the mounting difficulties facing UK officials as they attempt to line up post-Brexit trade deals around the world. Japan and the EU began trading under a new free trade agreement this month, an arrangement that will be unavailable to the UK after Brexit. While officials from the UK and Japan are seeking to agree a bilateral deal, it will not be in place before 29 March when Britain is scheduled to leave the EU. The UK\u2019s trade with Japan will also revert to World Trade Organization tariffs in the case of a no-deal Brexit. The Department for International Trade (DIT) told business leaders this week that time was running out for Britain to roll-over trade deals with about 60 countries the EU has free trade arrangements with, which the UK benefits from until it leaves the bloc. Barring a handful of small and medium-sized countries, including Chile and the Faroe Islands, the majority of deals are expected to miss the deadline. One attendee at the meeting said the lack of clarity about the UK\u2019s trading relationship with the EU after Brexit had held up progress, and that the Japan-EU deal included a \u201cmost-favoured nation\u201d clause that meant Tokyo could not offer anything better on trade in services to Britain than it had given to the EU. Other countries unlikely to agree deals before 29 March include major UK trading partners such as Turkey, South Korea and Canada, they said. Japan is a significant market for the UK as it is among the largest trading partners for Britain outside the EU. Britain has a trade surplus with Japan, exporting about \u00a312.5bn in goods and services a year while importing about \u00a311.5bn. A DIT spokesperson said: \u201cOur priority is to avoid disruption to businesses as we leave the EU and more DIT staff have been allocated to no-deal planning. \u201cThe Japanese prime minister and Theresa May agreed this January both countries would work quickly to establish a new economic partnership between Japan and the UK using the basis of the Economic Partnership Agreement.\u201d",

Nonetheless, the fans made their feelings known as the teams were read out, with Richarlison, the Brazil forward who followed Silva to Goodison Park last summer, also singled out by the boo boys. \u201cJavi Gracia, he\u2019s better than you,\u201d seemed particularly cruel.</p> <p>The Everton manager made three changes from the side <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/06/everton-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">that lost to Manchester City in midweek</a> as they attempted to turn around awful form that has yielded 11 points since the start of December. Many of Silva\u2019s problems in that run have stemmed from his leaky defence, as was typified by the attempts to clear in the 11th minute after Deeney chested the ball down in the area.

With seconds left before half-time, Gerard Deulofeu should have put the hosts in front after good work from the graceful Will Hughes but failed to connect properly with his attempt.</p> <p>Gracia withdrew Ken Sema at the break and sent on Gray in an attempt to stretch Everton\u2019s defence.

      "bodyText": "This return was never likely to be a happy one for Marco Silva. Thirteen months after he was unceremoniously sacked by Watford, Andre Gray\u2019s second-half goal meant Everton went down to yet another defeat \u2013 their fifth in six matches in all competitions \u2013 on an afternoon that he and Richarlison will want to forget quickly. \u201cThe club created a strategy,\u201d said Silva. \u201cAll I can control is my job and I think I did it well.\u201d Before the match, the Watford captain, Troy Deeney, had distanced himself from comments he made at a fans forum this week where he promised to kick Everton\u2019s players. Yet with passions running high in this part of Hertfordshire, as the chief executive, Scott Duxbury, said he would not engage with Silva in the opposition dugout, some supporters greeted their former manager with yellow inflatable snakes. Watford are still seeking compensation for what they believe was an illegal approach from Everton after Ronald Koeman was dismissed in October 2017 and attempts to mediate a settlement between the two clubs failed, although Deeney appeared to fare better in the pre-match warm-up as he shared a warm embrace with Silva. Nonetheless, the fans made their feelings known as the teams were read out, with Richarlison, the Brazil forward who followed Silva to Goodison Park last summer, also singled out by the boo boys. \u201cJavi Gracia, he\u2019s better than you,\u201d seemed particularly cruel. The Everton manager made three changes from the side that lost to Manchester City in midweek as they attempted to turn around awful form that has yielded 11 points since the start of December. Many of Silva\u2019s problems in that run have stemmed from his leaky defence, as was typified by the attempts to clear in the 11th minute after Deeney chested the ball down in the area. Luckily for Michael Keane, Jordan Pickford somehow managed to divert \u00c9tienne Capoue\u2019s shot from five yards out on to the bar and over. Keane had Everton\u2019s first chance soon after when \u2013 not for the first time in the opening period \u2013 Richarlison was fouled, but his header from the resulting free-kick went straight at Ben Foster. The goalkeeper, who Deeney had revealed \u201ceats shit, trains twice a week and turns up on a Saturday and is unbelievable\u201d, also made a smart save from Kurt Zouma and then had to be alert to chase 40 yards out of his goal after Tom Davies broke free. For all their possession in the Everton half, Watford were guilty of overplaying on several occasions and no more so than when a loose pass on the edge of their own area fell to Gylfi Sigurdsson and his shot was well saved by Foster. With seconds left before half-time, Gerard Deulofeu should have put the hosts in front after good work from the graceful Will Hughes but failed to connect properly with his attempt. Gracia withdrew Ken Sema at the break and sent on Gray in an attempt to stretch Everton\u2019s defence. But it was a piece of improvisation from Sigurdsson that almost broke the deadlock as his clever lob left Foster stranded, only to bounce off the woodwork. Watford\u2019s best chance of scoring seemed to be their threat from set pieces, with Pickford fortunate to escape with a free-kick when he had missed an attempted punch from a corner whipped dangerously across the face of his goal. Everton\u2019s failure to clear another corner, albeit one that should not have been awarded, proved to be their undoing, however. Craig Cathcart\u2019s brilliant backheel \u2013 \u201cIt was a pass more of a striker than a centre-back,\u201d said Gracia \u2013 allowed Hughes to find space on the right and he picked out Gray for the simplest of finishes. Lucas Digne hit the crossbar with a free-kick before substitute Dominic Calvert-Lewin wasted a golden chance to earn a point with a header that missed the target. Everton\u2019s misery was compounded when Zouma was sent off after the final whistle for arguing with the officials. \u201cWe had the chances to achieve the result but we were not effective,\u201d said Silva, who added he would be seeking out Lee Probert for an explanation over Zouma\u2019s dismissal. Yet with the Watford supporters\u2019 gleeful rendition of \u201cyou\u2019re getting sacked in the morning\u201d ringing in his ears as he returned to Merseyside, only time will tell if Silva\u2019s employers share the same inclination.",

      "bodyText": "A midweek resumption for horse racing appears a lot closer following news on Saturday that no new positives have been found for equine influenza, after scientists had worked night and day at the Animal Health Trust to process swabs taken from hundreds of racehorses. That was especially good news for the Durham trainer Rebecca Menzies, whose horses tested clear in spite of the worrying symptoms exhibited by three of her charges. \u201cMy team here are all delighted,\u201d she said. \u201cMy grateful thanks on behalf of ourselves and all racing fans to the huge amount of work by the British Horseracing Authority in the last few days. Undoubtedly the actions taken will ensure we are back racing as soon as possible.\u201d Racing\u2019s ruling body is still on course to make a decision on Monday about whether the sport can resume next week, possibly as soon as Wednesday. In the meantime, it urged caution about reading too much into the latest news, noting that results are known for only 720 swabs out of more than 2,000 received. \u201cThere are many more tests to analyse,\u201d David Sykes, the BHA\u2019s director of equine health, said. \u201cThe nature of the incubation period means that a negative test now doesn\u2019t mean that a horse has never had this flu virus.\u201d For that reason, the 174 stables under lockdown will remain as such for the time being. \u201cI would advise against anyone drawing any conclusions or making any predictions based on this set of results,\u201d Sykes said, stressing the importance of strict adherence to the ramped-up biosecurity measures in place at stables and racecourses. But he might as well have told football fans not to celebrate a goal, as the reaction was swift: Paddy Power slashed the odds against racing resuming by next Sunday from 6-4 to 1-3. \u201cThat\u2019s really good news,\u201d Colin Tizzard said. \u201cAs soon as these other tests come back clear, we can get back racing.\u201d The Dorset trainer is especially hopeful the Denman Chase, cancelled along with the rest of the British action this weekend, can be restaged on Saturday, so he can get a Gold Cup prep-run into Native River. The good news came at a helpful juncture for the BHA, as a significant section of the racing community had begun to voice doubts about its lockdown policy. Nigel Twiston-Davies led the charge, calling the decision to suspend racing a massive overreaction, and others expressed similar sentiments, including fellow trainers Chris Wall, Mark Tompkins, Karl Burke and the prolific owner Marwan Koukash. Their concerns are evidently shared by Mark Johnston, who has saddled more winners than any trainer in the history of British racing.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mark-galeotti\" title=\"\">Mark Galeotti</a> is an expert on Russian politics and crime. He is a Jean Monnet fellow at the European University Institute, a non-resident fellow at the Institute of International Relations Prague and senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. He has published extensively on Russia. Galeotti\u2019s latest book, <em>We Need to Talk About Putin</em>, argues that the Russian leader is widely misunderstood.</p> <p><strong>What is the biggest popular misconception about </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin\" title=\"\"><strong>Vladimir Putin</strong></a><strong>?</strong><br>I think it is precisely that he runs everything. There is still this notion that he is some kind of James Bond super-villain. First, that\u2019s just not the way the world is; also, he could be considered something of a lazy autocrat who sits back and lets others come up with all kinds of plans and stratagems of their own.</p> <p><strong>Why, then, do western analysts get him wrong?</strong><br>In fairness, there are a lot of analysts who don\u2019t, but insofar as they do, I think it\u2019s for several reasons. One is that it\u2019s a lot more comforting to feel you\u2019re trying to get into the head of one particular man rather than try to comprehend all the different directions in which a variety of different players could take Russian policy. Second, Putin himself has contributed to this extraordinary myth. It\u2019s funny, because in many ways he\u2019s a rather drab figure. He has become the Rorschach ink blot in which everyone can invest their own fears and suspicions and come up with their own personal Putin.</p> <p><strong>What is the relationship between Russia</strong><strong> and the former Soviet Union?</strong><br>All countries resemble their past, to an extent. There are similarities in terms of the authoritarian system, the essential corruption of the elite and suchlike, but I think this is a country that has gone through some quite dramatic changes. First of all, it\u2019s not ideological. The Soviet Union, however half-heartedly and haphazardly, did at least pretend that it had some grand global vision. But Russia is very much in a process of transition: it is moving, very slowly admittedly, into a more western pattern that is familiar to us. Therefore, what we\u2019re seeing is not so much the growth pains of a new Russia as much as the dying pains of the Soviet Union.</p> <p><strong>Do you think both the left and</strong><strong> right tend to view Russia through the lens of the </strong><strong>cold </strong><strong>war?</strong><br>Yes, and I think it\u2019s done in Russia just as much as in the west. What we see at the moment is a period of intense and sometimes quite vicious geopolitical competition, which is in some ways reminiscent of the cold war. But if you use that term it comes with all kinds of baggage. We need to accept that this is something new. On the right you have people harking back to eras of KGB; on the left we have people who believe sentimentally that Russia is some kind of socialist country, when in many ways it\u2019s almost a rapacious caricature of late capitalism.</p> <p><strong>What are Putin\u2019s key motivations?</strong><br>They are essentially emotional. One of them is for his own security and, most importantly, legacy. It\u2019s striking the extent to which he is trying to build his place within the grand march of Russian history. This is also a battle for respect. Time and again, what comes up is that Russia wants to be treated as a great power. And that is really the challenge, because in any objective terms Russia is not a great power.</p> <p><strong>You touch on the attempted assassination of the Skripals. What\u2019s the appropriate response</strong><strong>?</strong><br>If one looks at Putin and his advisers, they think that not only is the west weak but also it has already made up its mind about Russia and they have very little to lose. A lot of this is prison yard posturing: you want to look so tough that no one messes with you. All we can do with Putin is try to contain him, but all he can do is exploit our weaknesses. We should be much tougher on the regime, while reaching out to ordinary Russians.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of people would prefer to believe that it was Putin and not the American public who got Trump in the White House</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>How much influence</strong><strong> do you think Russia had on the US elections?</strong><br>I honestly feel that it\u2019s been dramatically overplayed. I can understand why. A lot of people would prefer to believe that it was Putin and not the American public who got Trump in the White House. But I think the more we look at it, the more it\u2019s clear that those three crucial states that really swung it for Trump were three states in which the Russians had done very little. Clearly, leaking the emails of Hillary Clinton helped shape the discussion. Of course the Russians will try, but the irony is the more we talk up their impact, the more power we give Putin. Arguably, we ought to be laughing at the Russians a lot more.</p> <p><strong>What will happen </strong><strong>in Russia post-Putin</strong><strong>?</strong><br>That\u2019s the question everyone in Russia is thinking about. I get the sense that this is a man who is bored and tired in the job. The minutiae of government are no longer of interest to him. His term of government will last until 2024. Although some people are talking about ways he could stay in power, I think he would like even before then to have found a successor, while giving himself a father-of-the-nation role. But my view is that history is not on Putin\u2019s side. On the whole, ordinary Russian people, but also the Russian elite, do not want to be in some ideological crusade against the west. I am ultimately optimistic about Russia\u2019s trajectory.</p> <p><strong>What books are on your bedside table?</strong><br>Because much of my reading is about Russian politics, organised crime and terrorism tend not to be uplifting; for other kinds of reading I want escapism. I\u2019m currently binge-reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/25/lost-novel-flashman-papers-creator-published-captain-in-calico\" title=\"\">George MacDonald Fraser</a>\u2019s Flashman novels again, which are an absolute delight. The other one is <em>The Longer the Thread</em>, a thriller by two women who write under the name of Emma Lathen.</p> <p><strong>How do you decide </strong><strong>what to read?</strong><br>Reviews, to an extent, and now we\u2019re all pawns of the Amazon algorithms. Because I travel a lot I read a lot of my stuff on Kindle. Talking to people, friends, it\u2019s actually a nice topic to recommend books to people and be recommended by.</p> <p><strong>Which classic novel did you read recently for the first time?</strong><br>It would probably be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/22/franz-kafka-winter-reads\" title=\"\">Kafka\u2019s <em>The Castle</em></a>. I lived in Prague for two years until the middle of last year and I suddenly realised that I had never read that.</p> <p><strong>Which classic novel are you most ashamed </strong><strong>to have not read?</strong><br>I\u2019m perfectly comfortable with my low-browness. In some ways I\u2019m ashamed, to the extent that I am, that I pick up various classic novels and think: \u201cNo!

      "bodyText": "Mark Galeotti is an expert on Russian politics and crime. He is a Jean Monnet fellow at the European University Institute, a non-resident fellow at the Institute of International Relations Prague and senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. He has published extensively on Russia. Galeotti\u2019s latest book, We Need to Talk About Putin, argues that the Russian leader is widely misunderstood. What is the biggest popular misconception about Vladimir Putin? I think it is precisely that he runs everything. There is still this notion that he is some kind of James Bond super-villain. First, that\u2019s just not the way the world is; also, he could be considered something of a lazy autocrat who sits back and lets others come up with all kinds of plans and stratagems of their own. Why, then, do western analysts get him wrong? In fairness, there are a lot of analysts who don\u2019t, but insofar as they do, I think it\u2019s for several reasons. One is that it\u2019s a lot more comforting to feel you\u2019re trying to get into the head of one particular man rather than try to comprehend all the different directions in which a variety of different players could take Russian policy. Second, Putin himself has contributed to this extraordinary myth. It\u2019s funny, because in many ways he\u2019s a rather drab figure. He has become the Rorschach ink blot in which everyone can invest their own fears and suspicions and come up with their own personal Putin. What is the relationship between Russia and the former Soviet Union? All countries resemble their past, to an extent. There are similarities in terms of the authoritarian system, the essential corruption of the elite and suchlike, but I think this is a country that has gone through some quite dramatic changes. First of all, it\u2019s not ideological. The Soviet Union, however half-heartedly and haphazardly, did at least pretend that it had some grand global vision. But Russia is very much in a process of transition: it is moving, very slowly admittedly, into a more western pattern that is familiar to us. Therefore, what we\u2019re seeing is not so much the growth pains of a new Russia as much as the dying pains of the Soviet Union. Do you think both the left and right tend to view Russia through the lens of the cold war? Yes, and I think it\u2019s done in Russia just as much as in the west. What we see at the moment is a period of intense and sometimes quite vicious geopolitical competition, which is in some ways reminiscent of the cold war. But if you use that term it comes with all kinds of baggage. We need to accept that this is something new. On the right you have people harking back to eras of KGB; on the left we have people who believe sentimentally that Russia is some kind of socialist country, when in many ways it\u2019s almost a rapacious caricature of late capitalism. What are Putin\u2019s key motivations? They are essentially emotional. One of them is for his own security and, most importantly, legacy. It\u2019s striking the extent to which he is trying to build his place within the grand march of Russian history. This is also a battle for respect. Time and again, what comes up is that Russia wants to be treated as a great power. And that is really the challenge, because in any objective terms Russia is not a great power. You touch on the attempted assassination of the Skripals. What\u2019s the appropriate response? If one looks at Putin and his advisers, they think that not only is the west weak but also it has already made up its mind about Russia and they have very little to lose. A lot of this is prison yard posturing: you want to look so tough that no one messes with you. All we can do with Putin is try to contain him, but all he can do is exploit our weaknesses. We should be much tougher on the regime, while reaching out to ordinary Russians. How much influence do you think Russia had on the US elections? I honestly feel that it\u2019s been dramatically overplayed. I can understand why. A lot of people would prefer to believe that it was Putin and not the American public who got Trump in the White House. But I think the more we look at it, the more it\u2019s clear that those three crucial states that really swung it for Trump were three states in which the Russians had done very little. Clearly, leaking the emails of Hillary Clinton helped shape the discussion. Of course the Russians will try, but the irony is the more we talk up their impact, the more power we give Putin. Arguably, we ought to be laughing at the Russians a lot more. What will happen in Russia post-Putin? That\u2019s the question everyone in Russia is thinking about. I get the sense that this is a man who is bored and tired in the job. The minutiae of government are no longer of interest to him. His term of government will last until 2024. Although some people are talking about ways he could stay in power, I think he would like even before then to have found a successor, while giving himself a father-of-the-nation role. But my view is that history is not on Putin\u2019s side. On the whole, ordinary Russian people, but also the Russian elite, do not want to be in some ideological crusade against the west. I am ultimately optimistic about Russia\u2019s trajectory. What books are on your bedside table? Because much of my reading is about Russian politics, organised crime and terrorism tend not to be uplifting; for other kinds of reading I want escapism. I\u2019m currently binge-reading George MacDonald Fraser\u2019s Flashman novels again, which are an absolute delight. The other one is The Longer the Thread, a thriller by two women who write under the name of Emma Lathen. How do you decide what to read? Reviews, to an extent, and now we\u2019re all pawns of the Amazon algorithms. Because I travel a lot I read a lot of my stuff on Kindle. Talking to people, friends, it\u2019s actually a nice topic to recommend books to people and be recommended by. Which classic novel did you read recently for the first time? It would probably be Kafka\u2019s The Castle. I lived in Prague for two years until the middle of last year and I suddenly realised that I had never read that. Which classic novel are you most ashamed to have not read? I\u2019m perfectly comfortable with my low-browness. In some ways I\u2019m ashamed, to the extent that I am, that I pick up various classic novels and think: \u201cNo! This isn\u2019t going to work for me.\u201d Is there a book that you expected to like and didn\u2019t? Game of Thrones. Could not stand it. I read a lot of science fiction. That just felt to me that you fed in Tolkien and half-a-dozen other authors to a computer. I haven\u2019t watched the TV series. What do you plan to read next? I want to return to Russian fiction, because it\u2019s a great way of getting back into a certain way of thinking. One is Boris Akunin\u2019s The Death of Achilles and the other is Vasily Aksyonov\u2019s The Island of Crimea. \u2022 We Need to Talk About Putin: How the West Gets Him Wrong by Mark Galeotti is published by Ebury (\u00a39.99).

He was reported to be conscious and breathing normally before going to hospital and spent the afternoon undergoing tests in a Teesside hospital. The break in play for Clarke\u2019s treatment led to 12 minutes of added time and in the 100th minute, Clarke\u2019s team-mate Kalvin Phillips cancelled out Middlesbrough\u2019s opener, which had been scored by Lewis Wing.

      "body": "<p><em><strong>This article, Basie\u2019s Band on Tour by Benny Green, was published in the Observer on 15 February 1959.</strong></em></p> <p>The Count Basie Orchestra is now midway through its third tour of Britain in two years, and the rarity appeal the unit once possessed for British audiences has vanished. Their concert at the Gaumont State, Kilburn, last Sunday, viewed with the dispassion of somebody who has heard them perform half a dozen times, was a frustrating affair because of the unbalance of the programme.</p> <p>There are in this Basie band several talented soloists, and the scant opportunity any of them got last Sunday to prove themselves must have puzzled many members of the audience. Trumpeter Joe Newman was hardly heard from, and the only substantial feature he did get was in \u201cThe Midgets,\u201d a muted trumpet-flute duet which has by now degenerated into comic relief. Frank Foster, a virile if somewhat unoriginal tenor saxophonist, was heard not at all during the first half of the concert, while Frank Wess, certainly not Foster\u2019s superior, was heavily featured by comparison.</p> <p>To many the most disappointing facet of this curious programme was the neglect of a gifted saxophonist like Billy Mitchell. Stylistically, Mitchell is the most interesting member of the orchestra, for besides being the only new recruit to the band since the last British tour, he is an ex-member of the Dizzy Gillespie Orchestra, a group far more advanced harmonically than the Basie band.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f80678cc2d56776ddaf924bae47726b51abd49a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f80678cc2d56776ddaf924bae47726b51abd49a/70_35_2615_3269/800.jpg\" alt=\"Count Basie rolling back the years at the Gaumont State in Kilburn, London, on 8 February 1959.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Count Basie rolling back the years at the Gaumont State in Kilburn, London, on 8 February 1959.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Waldorf/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Between Mitchell and Basie himself lie several periods of jazz development, and the sentimentalists in the audience, of whom I was one, must have found the constancy of Basie\u2019s piano solos most reassuring.

      "bodyText": "This article, Basie\u2019s Band on Tour by Benny Green, was published in the Observer on 15 February 1959. The Count Basie Orchestra is now midway through its third tour of Britain in two years, and the rarity appeal the unit once possessed for British audiences has vanished. Their concert at the Gaumont State, Kilburn, last Sunday, viewed with the dispassion of somebody who has heard them perform half a dozen times, was a frustrating affair because of the unbalance of the programme. There are in this Basie band several talented soloists, and the scant opportunity any of them got last Sunday to prove themselves must have puzzled many members of the audience. Trumpeter Joe Newman was hardly heard from, and the only substantial feature he did get was in \u201cThe Midgets,\u201d a muted trumpet-flute duet which has by now degenerated into comic relief. Frank Foster, a virile if somewhat unoriginal tenor saxophonist, was heard not at all during the first half of the concert, while Frank Wess, certainly not Foster\u2019s superior, was heavily featured by comparison. To many the most disappointing facet of this curious programme was the neglect of a gifted saxophonist like Billy Mitchell. Stylistically, Mitchell is the most interesting member of the orchestra, for besides being the only new recruit to the band since the last British tour, he is an ex-member of the Dizzy Gillespie Orchestra, a group far more advanced harmonically than the Basie band. Between Mitchell and Basie himself lie several periods of jazz development, and the sentimentalists in the audience, of whom I was one, must have found the constancy of Basie\u2019s piano solos most reassuring. The highly stylised understatement, the deft economy of notes, and the consummate sense of time, together with the disarming descents into the pounding bonhomie of the late Fats Waller, were identical to the solos of the vintage years. The current Basie reputation is based on a few uncomplicated factors, the return to a simple, uninhibited beat, the use of themes and settings enabling the ensemble to phrase with the same apparent freedom of a single man improvising, and the masterly control of dynamics, by now something of a fetish. When these factors are combined in a single performance, as in the slow-medium themes \u201cIn A Mellow Tone\u201d and \u201cLittle Darling,\u201d sixteen men play with a mutual sympathy unmatched anywhere in the world of jazz, and the precise nature of Basie\u2019s contribution to jazz is made apparent. Much of the programme selection is influenced too heavily by the presence of Joe Williams, a blues singer with tremendous potential and an even larger fan following. To those raised on his great predecessor, Jimmy Rushing, perhaps Williams is a shade too mannered, but there is no question of the power and beauty of his voice and his jazz affinities. When the subtlety and emotional power of his singing matched the finely poised band accompaniment, as in \u201cGee Baby, Ain\u2019t I Good To You,\u201d his presence seems justified, but not all his songs reach this standard.

      "body": "<p>G<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/giorgio-moroder\" title=\"\">iorgio Moroder</a> wants to set the record straight. Sat in the living room of his family home in the Italian Alps, which pleasingly features a white grand piano, wall-to-wall avocado shag carpet and dozens of framed gold discs, the super-producer and owner of music history\u2019s most glorious moustache wants to unpick some cliches. First of all, he says, he never really liked or went to clubs. Nor was he ever much of a dancer. And despite his profound impact on, well, both clubs and dancing, he would prefer it if we stopped referring to him as the grandfather of dance music.</p> <p>\u201cNo, and I do not like being called the godfather of disco and electronic music either,\u201d he says, wryly. \u201cIt\u2019s better than being called the grandfather, but I still don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p> <p>But it\u2019s not an overstatement to declare that Moroder definitively changed the face of modern pop. The man who created what Brian Eno breathlessly described to David Bowie as \u201cthe sound of the future\u201d had a staggering knack for creating floorfillers that have birthed entire genres: one track alone, the euphoric 1977 Donna Summer mega-smash <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2qI6UDD2uQ\" title=\"\">I Feel Love</a>, has been credited with paving the way for Italo, house, techno, trance, Bollywood disco and, for better or worse, EDM.</p> <p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t dance to I Feel Love,\u201d claims Moroder, and then begins riffing that famous pulsing synth \u2013 duhduhduhduhduhduhduh \u2013 and nodding along. \u201cIt\u2019s not very good to dance to. Songs like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StKVS0eI85I\" title=\"\">Call Me</a> [Blondie] is really good, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IdEhvuNxV8\" title=\"\">Hot Stuff</a> is better\u201d I point out weakly that he might be wrong; not uniquely, the full 15-minute mix of I Feel Love is my single favourite record to dance to. His eyebrows waggle in glee.</p> <p>\u201cCan you dance to it? I don\u2019t even like dancing, but my wife dances quite well a lot.\u201d</p> <p>I tell him I danced so hard to it at a wedding recently that my entire sari unravelled on the dancefloor. He roars. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why I make good club music \u2013 because I don\u2019t go to clubs!\u201d</p> <p>At 78, with more than five decades in the music industry, Moroder is preparing to embark on his first ever live tour across Europe. The production has been over a year in the making: he\u2019s hoping to create a \u201cdiscotheque feeling, [where I can be] spontaneous, not produce some big stiff concert like <a href=\"http://www.hans-zimmer.com/\" title=\"\">Hans Zimmer</a> where you cannot change a note.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxCqZHSxd2E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dxCqZHSxd2E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Donna Summer\u2019s I Feel Love, produced by Moroder.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Not only will this be his first ever live showing for the raft of iconic hits he and Summer created together, but a chance to revisit the golden period when Moroder released <em>From Here to Eternity</em> (1977); reinvented Sparks (<em>No.1 in Heaven</em>, 1979); produced Janet Jackson (<em>Dream Street</em>, 1984); worked with David Bowie (<em>Cat People</em>, 1982); and gifted Phil Oakey his then biggest hit (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1lzqJCeJ0\" title=\"\">Together in Electric Dreams</a>, 1984).</p> <p>Is he nervous?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I play enough to compose, but with a computer, if you make a mistake you just redo it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAll my life I was backstage, in the studio, in the background, but nervous? Me? Not at all.\u201d He chuckles. Moroder may have worked with the biggest egos in film and music, but it doesn\u2019t seem to have rubbed off; he is softly tuned, self-effacing company. \u201cIf I were to play the piano or designed difficult things then I would be nervous, but I do exactly what I want to do and the big work is not mine \u2013 that will be the singers, and they are absolutely top.\u201d</p> <p>He considers himself an average musician. \u201cI learned a little about music, I play a little, I play enough to compose; but with a computer, if you make a mistake you just redo it as often as you need. I could never play live what we have the musicians doing on stage or in the studio.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, at his peak, Moroder led a hit factory that became dance music\u2019s answer to Motown. Once the disco backlash kicked in, his team of musicians and engineers pivoted to Hollywood and scored <em>Flashdance</em>, <em>Midnight Express</em>, <em>Scarface</em>, <em>American Gigolo</em>, <em>Top </em><em>Gun</em> and much more. He won four Golden Globes and three Oscars for his film work, and picked up four Grammys in a career that has spanned more than a dozen studio albums. </p> <p>With the sort of silly money offers that come with the reputation Moroder had, it was inevitable that he also produced a fair amount of dross: blustering arena rock, cornball 80s guitars and a line of commissions for Olympics anthems. At one point, he was convinced by Sylvester Stallone to visit Bob Dylan at home in Malibu to ask if Dylan would write the lyrics for a song Moroder had composed for <em>Rambo III</em>. To his credit, Dylan listened to the track \u201cabout four times\u201d before politely declining.</p> <p>Moroder\u2019s last major hit was Berlin\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx51eegLTY8\" title=\"\">Take My Breath Away</a>, for <em>Top Gun</em>, which won an Oscar in 1987 for best song and went to No 1 in the US, UK and across Europe. \u201cIt was difficult, it took days of work\u2026 I had two different versions of that one, but it is probably my favourite song [that I have written].\u201d</p> <p>A period of apparent quiet kicked in. Moroder married Francisca Gutierrez, the hostess of his favourite restaurant in Los Angeles, became a father at 50, and took up golf. He built and sold cars, designed a pyramid for the Dubai skyline and began spending half the year in <a href=\"https://www.valgardena.it/en/ortisei/\" title=\"\">Ortisei</a>, the pretty Italian town he grew up in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f63aee8db38fd28212698cd906b3c1820404687\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f63aee8db38fd28212698cd906b3c1820404687/0_154_4822_3251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donna Summer with Giorgio Moroder in 1976\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donna Summer with Giorgio Moroder in 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/daft-punk\" title=\"\">Daft Punk</a> called. The French duo have been lifting from the best of Moroder unashamedly since the beginning of their career; their early noughties reconfiguration as a pair of robots was partially in homage to the sleeve of Moroder\u2019s 1977 album, <em>Munich Machine</em>. \u201cAll I know is that Daft Punk say they wouldn\u2019t be here without me being there,\u201d he says, with an emphatic shrug.</p> <p>His son urged him to meet them, but Moroder didn\u2019t think too much of the experience and had almost forgotten about it until, two years later, a track called Giorgio arrived on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/19/daft-punk-random-access-memories\" title=\"\">Random Access Memories</a></em>, Daft Punk\u2019s 2013 disco album. Suddenly, he was everywhere again: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/david-guetta\" title=\"\">David Guetta</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/avicii\" title=\"\">Avicii</a>, Lady Gaga wanted to work with him. He began a DJ career at 73 and played sets across the world. A new album followed, 2015\u2019s best-overlooked <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/14/giorgio-moroder-deja-vu-review-unholy-mishmash\" title=\"\">D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu</a></em>, featuring Britney Spears, Sia, Kylie Minogue et al.</p> <p>Now, every couple of weeks, Moroder sits at the laptop in his home studio and works his way through the US Billboard 100 and UK Top 40 charts on YouTube. \u201cThe quality of recording is just so good now,\u201d he marvels. \u201cI love digital, I was one of the first to use it; it\u2019s clean. Some people say analogue has a sound that\u2019s more human, but if you really want analogue sound you can have it in the computer too. And I still love dance songs and EDM \u2013 not everybody likes it, but I do. Even Ed Sheeran \u2013 he has some incredible sounds and arrangements; some of the songs now have two billion clicks on YouTube, but they deserve it, they\u2019re so good. All those new guys, they work so hard, I don\u2019t know how some of them handle it.\u201d</p> <p>Moroder is certain that hedonism is far rarer in the industry now than in his heyday. \u201cI was talking to David Guetta recently \u2013 he doesn\u2019t even drink coffee! <a href=\"http://www.steveaoki.com/\" title=\"\">Aoki</a> has maybe one sake and he is exercising all day long. He does 150 shows a year, it\u2019s mindboggling \u2013 you can\u2019t drink or be high if you\u2019re working like that. Of course, Avicii was an exception.\u201d</p> <p>Moroder pauses solemnly and strokes his moustache. Swedish DJ Avicii was found dead in a Muscat hotel room last April, aged 28.</p> <p>\u201cI knew Avicii, I play his songs [in my sets], I worked with him in 2013 and he was on drugs then and kind of already\u2026 you know.\u201d He shakes his head. Surely Moroder is somewhat inured to that kind of thing? \u201cI never did coke\u2026 zero,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, the musicians and the technical guys\u2026 they were on coke when I was not there. The only thing I noticed, but I didn\u2019t realise at the time, was that when they were so high they broke a lot of speakers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61a29d2286202e55cbf7d926a68038bb341013cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61a29d2286202e55cbf7d926a68038bb341013cd/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Williams, Pharrell Williams, Giorgio Moroder and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo of Daft Punkin 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Williams, Pharrell Williams, Giorgio Moroder and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo of Daft Punk in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Davis/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did they start kicking in studio equipment?</p> <p>\u201cNo, they would just get so high they needed to listen to music so loud, they blew the speakers.

      "bodyText": "Giorgio Moroder wants to set the record straight. Sat in the living room of his family home in the Italian Alps, which pleasingly features a white grand piano, wall-to-wall avocado shag carpet and dozens of framed gold discs, the super-producer and owner of music history\u2019s most glorious moustache wants to unpick some cliches. First of all, he says, he never really liked or went to clubs. Nor was he ever much of a dancer. And despite his profound impact on, well, both clubs and dancing, he would prefer it if we stopped referring to him as the grandfather of dance music. \u201cNo, and I do not like being called the godfather of disco and electronic music either,\u201d he says, wryly. \u201cIt\u2019s better than being called the grandfather, but I still don\u2019t like it.\u201d But it\u2019s not an overstatement to declare that Moroder definitively changed the face of modern pop. The man who created what Brian Eno breathlessly described to David Bowie as \u201cthe sound of the future\u201d had a staggering knack for creating floorfillers that have birthed entire genres: one track alone, the euphoric 1977 Donna Summer mega-smash I Feel Love, has been credited with paving the way for Italo, house, techno, trance, Bollywood disco and, for better or worse, EDM. \u201cBut you can\u2019t dance to I Feel Love,\u201d claims Moroder, and then begins riffing that famous pulsing synth \u2013 duhduhduhduhduhduhduh \u2013 and nodding along. \u201cIt\u2019s not very good to dance to. Songs like Call Me [Blondie] is really good, Hot Stuff is better\u201d I point out weakly that he might be wrong; not uniquely, the full 15-minute mix of I Feel Love is my single favourite record to dance to. His eyebrows waggle in glee. \u201cCan you dance to it? I don\u2019t even like dancing, but my wife dances quite well a lot.\u201d I tell him I danced so hard to it at a wedding recently that my entire sari unravelled on the dancefloor. He roars. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why I make good club music \u2013 because I don\u2019t go to clubs!\u201d At 78, with more than five decades in the music industry, Moroder is preparing to embark on his first ever live tour across Europe. The production has been over a year in the making: he\u2019s hoping to create a \u201cdiscotheque feeling, [where I can be] spontaneous, not produce some big stiff concert like Hans Zimmer where you cannot change a note.\u201d Not only will this be his first ever live showing for the raft of iconic hits he and Summer created together, but a chance to revisit the golden period when Moroder released From Here to Eternity (1977); reinvented Sparks (No.1 in Heaven, 1979); produced Janet Jackson (Dream Street, 1984); worked with David Bowie (Cat People, 1982); and gifted Phil Oakey his then biggest hit (Together in Electric Dreams, 1984). Is he nervous? \u201cAll my life I was backstage, in the studio, in the background, but nervous? Me? Not at all.\u201d He chuckles. Moroder may have worked with the biggest egos in film and music, but it doesn\u2019t seem to have rubbed off; he is softly tuned, self-effacing company. \u201cIf I were to play the piano or designed difficult things then I would be nervous, but I do exactly what I want to do and the big work is not mine \u2013 that will be the singers, and they are absolutely top.\u201d He considers himself an average musician. \u201cI learned a little about music, I play a little, I play enough to compose; but with a computer, if you make a mistake you just redo it as often as you need. I could never play live what we have the musicians doing on stage or in the studio.\u201d And yet, at his peak, Moroder led a hit factory that became dance music\u2019s answer to Motown. Once the disco backlash kicked in, his team of musicians and engineers pivoted to Hollywood and scored Flashdance, Midnight Express, Scarface, American Gigolo, Top Gun and much more. He won four Golden Globes and three Oscars for his film work, and picked up four Grammys in a career that has spanned more than a dozen studio albums. With the sort of silly money offers that come with the reputation Moroder had, it was inevitable that he also produced a fair amount of dross: blustering arena rock, cornball 80s guitars and a line of commissions for Olympics anthems. At one point, he was convinced by Sylvester Stallone to visit Bob Dylan at home in Malibu to ask if Dylan would write the lyrics for a song Moroder had composed for Rambo III. To his credit, Dylan listened to the track \u201cabout four times\u201d before politely declining. Moroder\u2019s last major hit was Berlin\u2019s Take My Breath Away, for Top Gun, which won an Oscar in 1987 for best song and went to No 1 in the US, UK and across Europe. \u201cIt was difficult, it took days of work\u2026 I had two different versions of that one, but it is probably my favourite song [that I have written].\u201d A period of apparent quiet kicked in. Moroder married Francisca Gutierrez, the hostess of his favourite restaurant in Los Angeles, became a father at 50, and took up golf. He built and sold cars, designed a pyramid for the Dubai skyline and began spending half the year in Ortisei, the pretty Italian town he grew up in. Then Daft Punk called. The French duo have been lifting from the best of Moroder unashamedly since the beginning of their career; their early noughties reconfiguration as a pair of robots was partially in homage to the sleeve of Moroder\u2019s 1977 album, Munich Machine. \u201cAll I know is that Daft Punk say they wouldn\u2019t be here without me being there,\u201d he says, with an emphatic shrug. His son urged him to meet them, but Moroder didn\u2019t think too much of the experience and had almost forgotten about it until, two years later, a track called Giorgio arrived on Random Access Memories, Daft Punk\u2019s 2013 disco album. Suddenly, he was everywhere again: David Guetta, Avicii, Lady Gaga wanted to work with him. He began a DJ career at 73 and played sets across the world. A new album followed, 2015\u2019s best-overlooked D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, featuring Britney Spears, Sia, Kylie Minogue et al. Now, every couple of weeks, Moroder sits at the laptop in his home studio and works his way through the US Billboard 100 and UK Top 40 charts on YouTube. \u201cThe quality of recording is just so good now,\u201d he marvels. \u201cI love digital, I was one of the first to use it; it\u2019s clean. Some people say analogue has a sound that\u2019s more human, but if you really want analogue sound you can have it in the computer too. And I still love dance songs and EDM \u2013 not everybody likes it, but I do. Even Ed Sheeran \u2013 he has some incredible sounds and arrangements; some of the songs now have two billion clicks on YouTube, but they deserve it, they\u2019re so good. All those new guys, they work so hard, I don\u2019t know how some of them handle it.\u201d Moroder is certain that hedonism is far rarer in the industry now than in his heyday. \u201cI was talking to David Guetta recently \u2013 he doesn\u2019t even drink coffee! Aoki has maybe one sake and he is exercising all day long. He does 150 shows a year, it\u2019s mindboggling \u2013 you can\u2019t drink or be high if you\u2019re working like that. Of course, Avicii was an exception.\u201d Moroder pauses solemnly and strokes his moustache. Swedish DJ Avicii was found dead in a Muscat hotel room last April, aged 28. \u201cI knew Avicii, I play his songs [in my sets], I worked with him in 2013 and he was on drugs then and kind of already\u2026 you know.\u201d He shakes his head. Surely Moroder is somewhat inured to that kind of thing? \u201cI never did coke\u2026 zero,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, the musicians and the technical guys\u2026 they were on coke when I was not there. The only thing I noticed, but I didn\u2019t realise at the time, was that when they were so high they broke a lot of speakers.\u201d Did they start kicking in studio equipment? \u201cNo, they would just get so high they needed to listen to music so loud, they blew the speakers. They were breaking one every week!\u201d Still, the best of Moroder\u2019s work \u2013 Utopia, First Hand Experience in Second Hand Love, Chase \u2013 builds to replicate the warm, skittish rush of being high. As the story goes, Love To Love You was extended into a 16-minute epic with Donna Summer moaning in no fewer than 22 recorded orgasms on the demand of Neil Bogart, head of Casablanca Records, who wanted a longer version of the original song to soundtrack the orgies at his house. She recalled being so mortified that she had to record it lying down in the dark. \u201cShe didn\u2019t! She said she did, but\u2026\u201d Moroder twinkles. \u201cI remember she was embarrassed to do the moaning with the guys in the studio \u2013 her husband was there, Pete Bellotte [Moroder\u2019s long-time silent collaborator] was there, and the engineer, so I said: \u2018OK, everybody out.\u2019 I switched all the lights off, kept just a little light so I could see her, but she was sitting on a chair. Maybe she dropped to the floor\u2026 but I do know I was her inspiration, that I know.\u201d He won\u2019t reveal some of the \u201cterrible decisions\u201d he made and offers he turned down over the years, but he will admit to saying no to being a judge on The X Factor recently. \u201cIt was a really big offer, a lot of money, but I was a little nervous.

It takes at least a year to find and develop the story.\u201d He is busy but undaunted: \u201cI\u2019m very happy.\u201d What\u2019s the best thing about being Giorgio Moroder, then?

I left with my mother, brother, aunt, and grandparents. My grandfather was furious, saying: \u2018Why do we have to leave?

We had to abandon our belongings, we couldn\u2019t carry them. We found a hut to sleep in. The man who owned it came.

There will be photo displays on Argel\u00e8s beach, exhibitions in every village near former camps, lectures, performances, and a new website. But for many years there has been silence and denial. \u201cThe history of the Retirada is a work in progress,\u201d says Agn\u00e8s Sajaloli, director of a memorial at Rivesaltes, near Perpignan, which served as an internment camp from where thousands were sent to their deaths. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know the details. Everyone involved had a different story.\u201d</p> <p>Once the refugees arrived in France the official reception was hostile. The French authorities opened the borders until Franco\u2019s troops, in pursuit of the Republicans, reached Le Perthus. But they were completely unprepared for the numbers: there were no provisions, no sanitation, and no shelter from harsh mountain weather for exhausted and demoralised refugees. They were given one loaf between five people and a small cup of water at 3pm, nothing else.</p> <p>At Prats-de-Mollo, where Morena\u2019s family arrived, many children died as a result of the cold. Soldiers were disarmed and the refugees were first corralled and then dispersed to camps. The French used Senegalese soldiers for the job. Morena\u2019s family were taken to a nearby holding camp while fighters and boys over 14 were transported to hastily opened camps on the inhospitable plains around Perpignan. \u201cThey were treated worse than prisoners of war,\u201d says Spanish civil war historian David Wingeate Pike. \u201cThey were treated like criminals.\u201dThe most notorious camps were on the beaches of Argel\u00e8s, Saint-Cyprien and Le Barcar\u00e8s \u2013 prone to strong winds, stinging sand storms and violent extremes of temperature. \u201cThese beach camps were terrible places,\u201d says Helen Graham, professor of Spanish history at Royal Holloway, University of London. \u201cThey were just sand and barbed wire. They had no shelter except tents. There was a problem of fresh water, there were no washing and toilet facilities \u2013 the sea had to do for everything. The people who arrived here were already ill, so there was an immediate problem with dysentery and typhoid. Many died.\u201d</p> <p>None of the refugees were released unless they could get \u201csponsorship\u201d from a legitimate person outside. But the rightwing press whipped up local hostility, claiming most internees were criminals or seditious communists, mocking them for complaining about rations.</p> <p>The camps were still there when the second world war broke out in autumn 1939, still there when France fell in 1940, and then became part of the apparatus of Vichy\u2019s collaborationist regime. This brought another 50,000 prisoners to the area, mainly Jews and other so-called undesirables: gypsies, gays and communists. To cope with this influx, the Spanish prisoners were used as labourers to convert 600 acres of military barracks at Rivesaltes into an internment camp. Sajaloli says: \u201cRivesaltes became a camp where different groups of ostracised people were held in harsh conditions. Over 2,000 Jews were sent to death camps from here.\u201d</p> <p>Antonio de la Fuente y Ferraz, 89, is another survivor whose memories are still raw. The son of a Republican fighter, he was nine when his family fled Puigcerd\u00e0 into France in February 1939. For the next four years he was in seven different internment camps. Rivesaltes \u201cwas the worst of all\u201d, he says: \u201cMy family spent nearly two years there in terrible conditions. My grandmother died there. The worst part was we didn\u2019t know where my father and uncle were. We were cold and hungry, and above all we were scared. We saw they were deporting the Jews to Germany, but we didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/29/national-museum-spanish-civil-war-barcelona\">Eighty years on, Spain may at last be able to confront the ghosts of civil war</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rivesaltes memorial camp only opened in 2015. \u201cIt was a 20-year fight to create it,\u201d says Sajaloli. \u201cThe mayor wanted the barracks to be bulldozed.\u201d But with pressure from historians and Filles et Fils de R\u00e9publicains Espagnols et fils d\u2019exodus d\u2019Espagne, the derelict barracks were preserved and now provide a haunting setting for a museum which is the focus of a painful awakening of memory.</p> <p>Nearly 200,000 refugees returned to Spain \u2013 after the French encouraged them to go and Franco shamefully lied that they would be well-received. Those who remained suffered greatly, moved between camps or used as forced labour. Republican fighters who escaped joined the resistance. Others, like Morena\u2019s family, suffered great deprivations, but were eventually absorbed into the local region, shaping its history and identity ever since. But while Franco lived, they could never return home.

      "bodyText": "It is 80 years since one of Europe\u2019s worst \u2013 and least known \u2013 refugee crises, but memories of the Retirada (or withdrawal) are still vivid for Madeleine Morena. Her family were among 500,000 Spaniards who fled across the eastern Pyrenees to France when Barcelona fell to Franco\u2019s forces near the end of the Spanish civil war on 26 January 1939, triggering one of the greatest exoduses of modern times. Photos and documentary footage show the incredible sight of half a million people pouring towards the border towns of Puigcerd\u00e0 in Spain, and Prats-de-Mollo and Le Perthus in France \u2013 women and children, Republican fighters carrying weapons, members of the International brigades. The local French newspaper, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendant, described \u201ca haunting cohort of civilians, armed soldiers, vehicles and animals\u201d. \u201cI was six years old when Barcelona fell,\u201d says Morena, speaking in the village of Vin\u00e7a, nestling in the foothills of the Pyrenees. \u201cMy father and uncle were Republican fighters so we had to flee our village near the French border. I left with my mother, brother, aunt, and grandparents. My grandfather was furious, saying: \u2018Why do we have to leave? I\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u2019 Everyone was panicking and I was very scared. We knew we were in danger. We just took clothes and a few possessions. I had my doll. \u201cThe roads gave out near France so we had to walk over the Col D\u2019Ares pass. It was bitterly cold and there was snow. We had to abandon our belongings, we couldn\u2019t carry them. We found a hut to sleep in. The man who owned it came. It turned out he was a distant relation and in the morning he took me on his shoulders and we walked into France.\u201d Numerous events will commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Retirada, which came to an end on 13 February 1939 when Franco\u2019s army reached the French border. There will be photo displays on Argel\u00e8s beach, exhibitions in every village near former camps, lectures, performances, and a new website. But for many years there has been silence and denial. \u201cThe history of the Retirada is a work in progress,\u201d says Agn\u00e8s Sajaloli, director of a memorial at Rivesaltes, near Perpignan, which served as an internment camp from where thousands were sent to their deaths. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know the details. Everyone involved had a different story.\u201d Once the refugees arrived in France the official reception was hostile. The French authorities opened the borders until Franco\u2019s troops, in pursuit of the Republicans, reached Le Perthus. But they were completely unprepared for the numbers: there were no provisions, no sanitation, and no shelter from harsh mountain weather for exhausted and demoralised refugees. They were given one loaf between five people and a small cup of water at 3pm, nothing else. At Prats-de-Mollo, where Morena\u2019s family arrived, many children died as a result of the cold. Soldiers were disarmed and the refugees were first corralled and then dispersed to camps. The French used Senegalese soldiers for the job. Morena\u2019s family were taken to a nearby holding camp while fighters and boys over 14 were transported to hastily opened camps on the inhospitable plains around Perpignan. \u201cThey were treated worse than prisoners of war,\u201d says Spanish civil war historian David Wingeate Pike. \u201cThey were treated like criminals.\u201dThe most notorious camps were on the beaches of Argel\u00e8s, Saint-Cyprien and Le Barcar\u00e8s \u2013 prone to strong winds, stinging sand storms and violent extremes of temperature. \u201cThese beach camps were terrible places,\u201d says Helen Graham, professor of Spanish history at Royal Holloway, University of London. \u201cThey were just sand and barbed wire. They had no shelter except tents. There was a problem of fresh water, there were no washing and toilet facilities \u2013 the sea had to do for everything. The people who arrived here were already ill, so there was an immediate problem with dysentery and typhoid. Many died.\u201d None of the refugees were released unless they could get \u201csponsorship\u201d from a legitimate person outside. But the rightwing press whipped up local hostility, claiming most internees were criminals or seditious communists, mocking them for complaining about rations. The camps were still there when the second world war broke out in autumn 1939, still there when France fell in 1940, and then became part of the apparatus of Vichy\u2019s collaborationist regime. This brought another 50,000 prisoners to the area, mainly Jews and other so-called undesirables: gypsies, gays and communists. To cope with this influx, the Spanish prisoners were used as labourers to convert 600 acres of military barracks at Rivesaltes into an internment camp. Sajaloli says: \u201cRivesaltes became a camp where different groups of ostracised people were held in harsh conditions. Over 2,000 Jews were sent to death camps from here.\u201d Antonio de la Fuente y Ferraz, 89, is another survivor whose memories are still raw. The son of a Republican fighter, he was nine when his family fled Puigcerd\u00e0 into France in February 1939. For the next four years he was in seven different internment camps. Rivesaltes \u201cwas the worst of all\u201d, he says: \u201cMy family spent nearly two years there in terrible conditions. My grandmother died there. The worst part was we didn\u2019t know where my father and uncle were. We were cold and hungry, and above all we were scared. We saw they were deporting the Jews to Germany, but we didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d Rivesaltes memorial camp only opened in 2015. \u201cIt was a 20-year fight to create it,\u201d says Sajaloli. \u201cThe mayor wanted the barracks to be bulldozed.\u201d But with pressure from historians and Filles et Fils de R\u00e9publicains Espagnols et fils d\u2019exodus d\u2019Espagne, the derelict barracks were preserved and now provide a haunting setting for a museum which is the focus of a painful awakening of memory. Nearly 200,000 refugees returned to Spain \u2013 after the French encouraged them to go and Franco shamefully lied that they would be well-received. Those who remained suffered greatly, moved between camps or used as forced labour. Republican fighters who escaped joined the resistance. Others, like Morena\u2019s family, suffered great deprivations, but were eventually absorbed into the local region, shaping its history and identity ever since. But while Franco lived, they could never return home. It is a thought that still, 80 years on, makes her weep: \u201cMy parents never saw Spain again.\u201d The Retirada 26 January 1939 Barcelona, last stronghold of Spanish Republicans in Catalonia, falls to Franco\u2019s fascist troops, triggering an exodus of Republican fighters and their families. 27-28 Jan France opens its border to refugees \u2013 women, children and the injured. 30 Jan France opens a camp for internees at Argel\u00e8s beach. 5-9 Feb France accepts the retreating army, confiscating weapons and vehicles. 9 Feb Franco\u2019s army, pursuing refugees, reaches the border. 11 Feb onwards Camps open across the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales and neighbouring areas. By mid-March they will contain a quarter of a million refugees. 13 Feb The last refugees get over the border, now finally closed, bringing to an end the Retirada. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 February 2019 to clarify that when Barcelona fell in January 1939 it was the last Republican stronghold in Catalonia. In January 1939 Madrid, Valencia and Alicante were still held by the Republicans. Madrid fell to Franco on 28 March, and the Spanish civil war came to an end on 1 April 1939.",

In the 23 minutes that preceded it, Liverpool had shown diligence and patience but not much imagination in trying to break down Bournemouth\u2019s low defensive block. The visitors found they could cope with buildup play that varied between predictable and clumsy, and when Mohamed Salah found pockets of space on the right his attempts on goal did not cause Artur Boruc undue concern.</p> <p>The breakthrough, when it came, was simplicity itself, although Eddie Howe was probably right in claiming it was fractionally offside. A James Milner corner failed to beat the first defender, but when Naby Ke\u00efta calmly returned the ball to the right for the jobbing full-back to have another go he swung over a much better cross that Sadio Man\u00e9 met with a firm downward header. It was his fourth goal in four games and Man\u00e9 showed his versatility a couple of minutes later by launching Liverpool\u2019s next attack from close to the corner flag in his own half. A clever ball down the left channel found Roberto Firmino running into free space and when the Brazilian looked up he was able to pick out Georginio Wijnaldum up in support. The midfielder should probably have gone for goal himself from a threatening position, though he appeared to lack confidence and moved the ball wider to Salah, who miscontrolled.</p> <p>Wijnaldum did not make the same mistake when his next chance arrived 10 minutes later, courtesy of an inspired ball forward from Andy Robertson. Again in an unusually advanced position, Wijnaldum first showed neat control to reach the pass, then with the ball still bouncing spotted his opportunity to lift a shot over Boruc, who had advanced slightly from his line.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/archive-zip/giv-3902asAlOyMQLy4i/\" data-alt=\"The top three\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/archive-zip/giv-3902asAlOyMQLy4i/\">The top three</a> </figure>  <p>Bournemouth had stayed mostly compact after going a goal down but were obliged to come out a little with their deficit doubled. Before retiring to defensive duties the visitors had almost taken an early lead when Ryan Fraser tested Alisson in the second minute, but the goalkeeper beat away the shot. Salah brought a save from Boruc at the end of the first half as Liverpool tried to extend their lead and Jefferson Lerma fired over the bar just before the interval with his side attempting to get back into the game.</p> <p>Within three minutes of the restart Bournemouth\u2019s hopes of a comeback were quashed when Liverpool pushed further ahead in exquisite style.

      "bodyText": "Liverpool did not fluff their lines a third time. They returned to the top of the league with a slick and stylish victory that showcased the attacking talent they have at their disposal and made a useful dent in the goal-difference advantage Manchester City hold. City can regain the lead by beating Chelsea on Sunday, but Liverpool will then have a game in hand, a rest until the Champions League resumes with the visit of Bayern Munich, and the knowledge they can still overwhelm opponents when the need arises. Bournemouth may not present the toughest of challenges away from home, but after the points recently dropped most Liverpool fans would have greeted any sort of win with relief. The results are all that really count at this stage of the title race and Liverpool know if they keep winning there is nothing City can do, though this was a comfortable and controlled performance that could have produced a more emphatic scoreline and suggested plenty left in reserve. Just about the only disappointment for J\u00fcrgen Klopp and his players was a succession of missed chances at the end. With a little more composure in front of goal Liverpool could practically have wiped out the goal-difference deficit, and what a statement of intent that would have been. The opening goal came midway through the first half and changed the mood of the afternoon completely. In the 23 minutes that preceded it, Liverpool had shown diligence and patience but not much imagination in trying to break down Bournemouth\u2019s low defensive block. The visitors found they could cope with buildup play that varied between predictable and clumsy, and when Mohamed Salah found pockets of space on the right his attempts on goal did not cause Artur Boruc undue concern. The breakthrough, when it came, was simplicity itself, although Eddie Howe was probably right in claiming it was fractionally offside. A James Milner corner failed to beat the first defender, but when Naby Ke\u00efta calmly returned the ball to the right for the jobbing full-back to have another go he swung over a much better cross that Sadio Man\u00e9 met with a firm downward header. It was his fourth goal in four games and Man\u00e9 showed his versatility a couple of minutes later by launching Liverpool\u2019s next attack from close to the corner flag in his own half. A clever ball down the left channel found Roberto Firmino running into free space and when the Brazilian looked up he was able to pick out Georginio Wijnaldum up in support. The midfielder should probably have gone for goal himself from a threatening position, though he appeared to lack confidence and moved the ball wider to Salah, who miscontrolled. Wijnaldum did not make the same mistake when his next chance arrived 10 minutes later, courtesy of an inspired ball forward from Andy Robertson. Again in an unusually advanced position, Wijnaldum first showed neat control to reach the pass, then with the ball still bouncing spotted his opportunity to lift a shot over Boruc, who had advanced slightly from his line. Bournemouth had stayed mostly compact after going a goal down but were obliged to come out a little with their deficit doubled. Before retiring to defensive duties the visitors had almost taken an early lead when Ryan Fraser tested Alisson in the second minute, but the goalkeeper beat away the shot. Salah brought a save from Boruc at the end of the first half as Liverpool tried to extend their lead and Jefferson Lerma fired over the bar just before the interval with his side attempting to get back into the game. Within three minutes of the restart Bournemouth\u2019s hopes of a comeback were quashed when Liverpool pushed further ahead in exquisite style. Salah scored it, drilling a low shot into the bottom corner with his usual efficiency, though the sublime touches came from Ke\u00efta, with a superbly weighted ball forward into Firmino\u2019s path, and Firmino himself, who dummied to shoot before casually backheeling the ball into space where he knew Salah would be waiting. It was the Egyptian\u2019s 20th goal of the campaign in all competitions, making him the first Liverpool player since Luis Su\u00e1rez to achieve the feat in successive seasons. Salah hit the bar with only Boruc to beat as the game moved into its final quarter. The result was never in doubt but when Ke\u00efta, Firmino and Trent Alexander-Arnold joined him in missing gilt-edged opportunities from close range in the closing minutes it meant Bournemouth were allowed to get off relatively lightly. A little more ruthlessness would not go amiss if this is to be Liverpool\u2019s year.",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for joining me for this afternoon\u2019s game. Here is the report from Murrayfield: A quick word from Joe Schmidt, who hails \u201ca massive defensive effort\u201d. He adds that Sexton failed a head injury assessment after a \u201cstamp\u201d, but he doesn\u2019t expect it to be long-term. Schmidt doesn\u2019t criticise the Scottish efforts to target his fly-half, and brushes off suggestions that O\u2019Mahony illegally tackled Hogg. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear anything from the officials\u201d. He praises Carbery too - \u201che\u2019s growing in confidence\u201d. That result means only two teams can still win the grand slam - England and Wales. Which brings us to Saturday\u2019s second game, with Warren Gatland\u2019s mob in action against Italy. Join me for that, right about now. We\u2019ll have a match report online very soon. And Greig Laidlaw, who has some strong words for Romain Poite. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed. Handling errors cost us, but the referee doesn\u2019t seem to like us. We\u2019re not going to blame him, though. Ireland took their opportunities.\u201d There were some controversial moments, not least the tackle by Peter O\u2019Mahony that led to Stuart Hogg\u2019s shoulder injury. Scotland played their part too, with some hefty challenges on Johnny Sexton, who was also forced off. Ireland may have won, but Liam Murray isn\u2019t happy: \u201cThat was dire. We\u2019ve struggled to beat the 5th best team in the competition, displaying a complete lack of imagination, subtlety and inventiveness.\u201d Here\u2019s Rory Best: \u201cWe have a lot of belief in what we\u2019re doing ... it was tough mentally in the build-up, but we asked for a reaction and we got it. It wasn\u2019t the most spectacular game, we had a couple of chances and we took them. \u201cWe had to wear them down, we fronted up to their attack. Joey [Carbery] is a quality player, you don\u2019t want to see anyone go off injured, but it\u2019s great to see everyone coming off the bench and stepping up.\u201d We saw glimpses of the Green Machine there, Ireland wily and disciplined at the breakdown, and at set-pieces, and keeping Scotland at arms\u2019 length thanks to Keith Earls\u2019 try. It feels like a big opportunity missed for the hosts, who wilted under the pressure, making too many mistakes and failing to capitalise when they were on top. Scotland\u2019s final attack ends with - you guessed it - a knock on, and Ireland have ground out the win! 79 mins: Peter O\u2019Mahony is named man of the match - probably deserved, edging out Sean O\u2019Brien, Best and the impressive Carbery, who came off the bench. 78 mins: John Cooney is on for Conor Murray, who was much improved from his display in Dublin. Another fitful Scottish attack peters out at the halfway line, and time is almost up. 77 mins: A rare Scottish penalty, in their own half. Finn Russell kicks for touch - but Ireland take the lineout ball, Dillane the man in the right place again. What a frustrating second half for Scotland. 76 mins: Scotland snatch possession, but try to force the pass and Fraser Brown knocks on. Another handling error as Scotland are forced to try and up the tempo. 75 mins: Carbery, whose mistake led to Scotland\u2019s try, has been the standout player in the second half. His tackle stops the hosts\u2019 next attacking foray, before Ritchie knocks on, to groans from the Murrayfield faithful. 74 mins: Scotland try to disrupt the Irish lineout, but they get a predictable amount of joy. Ultan Dillane climbs highest to claim it. 73 mins: Kinghorn\u2019s kick downfield sets up an Irish lineout close to their own try line. Before it\u2019s taken, a short break in play as Huw Jones receives treatment. He looks OK to continue with his knee strapped up. 71 mins: Jordan Larmour, who struggled to make any impact against England, is on for Jacob Stockdale. Sean Cronin, his Leinster teammate, replaces the captain, Rory Best. 69 mins: Changes galore. For Scotland, Fraser Brown, Ali Price and Peter Horne are on, replacing McInally, Laidlaw and Johnson. For Ireland, Andrew Porter replaces Furlong, and Ultan Dillane and Josh van der Flier are also on. Quinn Roux and Sean O\u2019Brien go off. Carbery lands the kick, and Ireland have a useful cushion going into the final stages. 67 mins: After 27 brutal phases, Strauss is penalised. Carbery uses the advantage to try an ambitious kick through, but Ireland will come back for the kick at goal. 65 mins: Ireland trying to slow things down, and make this attack count. Kilcoyne tries to barrel through the Scottish defence, but they hold firm. Keith Earls comes infield to carry Ireland over the 22... 64 mins: An unfortunate moment for young Kinghorn, who spills an attempted catch in midfield. That\u2019s the first mistake he\u2019s made. Ireland will have the scrum... That could be a big three points, Laidlaw landing the penalty in testing conditions. He\u2019s up to 666 international points, one behind Gavin Hastings in the all-time standings. 62 mins: Scotland turn the ball over deep in Irish territory, and the over-eager Bundee Aki concedes a penalty. Laidlaw opts to kick for goal from an acute angle... 60 mins: Another knock-on for Scotland, who are in the process of beating themselves. The Munster man adds the conversion after a try he created. Dave Kilcoyne comes on for Ireland, replacing Healy. Rob Kearney, quiet thus far, shows a turn of pace to break through the Scottish defence. Seymour brings him down, but as Scotland try to regroup, Carbery powers through two tackles, skips downfield and loops a terrific pass out wide to Keith Earls. And just like that, Ireland find their attacking mojo and punish them. 54 mins: Ack, that promising position is surrendered as Harley knocks on. Scotland have been on top, by and large, since Sam Johnson\u2019s score 28 minutes in - but they\u2019ve got nothing to show for it. 52 mins: McInally takes care of business again, ripping the ball away from Tadhg Furlong. Blair Kinghorn wallops a kick downfield, and although Kearney kicks for touch, that\u2019s a big territorial swing for Scotland. 50 mins: Make that seven, as from the scrum, Cian Healy knocks on and has a stern word with himself. It\u2019s become a bit scrappy after that dramatic first half. 49 mins: Scotland\u2019s progress downfield is stopped by an unlucky Strauss knock-on. He\u2019s not happy with the referee, but rules are rules. Handling errors creeping up for Scotland - they have 10 to Ireland\u2019s six. 48 mins: Best delivers the lineout, Ireland win it and start an ominous drive for the line. Scotland hold on through 10 phases, and a loose pass puts Earls on the back foot. Stuart McInally stops him in his tracks, the momentum shifts, and Ireland are penalised. More sterling defensive work, this time from the hosts. 45 mins: Ireland enjoy a spell of possession, and Rob Harley is penalised for a high tackle. Ireland can\u2019t make use of the advantage, but Carbery kicks for the corner... 42 mins: Scottish scrum on the halfway line, and Laidlaw starts a passing move out wide - but Gray concedes a cheap penalty, taking Sean O\u2019Brien out needlessly. Joey Carbery kicks off the second half - no sign of Johnny Sexton. Ritchie is back for Scotland, but Rob Harley stays out there, with Ryan Wilson taken off. Here\u2019s our new Six Nations columnist, Ugo Monye, with a look ahead to England v France tomorrow: We\u2019ve just seen a clip of Stuart Hogg reacting to that late missed chance on the touchline. He got himself in a right old funk, booting a hole in an advertising hoarding before storming down the tunnel. Half-time reading That first half had pretty much everything - flowing attacking moves, ferocious defence and individual errors that have been ruthlessly punished. Scotland have dominated territory, and end on the front foot, but it\u2019s Ireland who have a narrow lead. Don\u2019t go anywhere. 39 mins: The Irish defence holds on through 20 phases, but as play shifts back to the right, there\u2019s room for Seymour - but Jones\u2019 pass is just behind him, and Stockdale holds him up a metre out. A Scottish knock-on follows, and Ireland hold firm! An incredible defensive effort. 38 mins: Scotland frantically searching for the go-ahead score, and get an advantage for an Irish knock-on. They keep scrambling for the line - the advantage goes untaken - but look for space on the far side... 35 mins: A moment to sum up this helter-skelter first half, as a loose ball bounces off the corner flag, and Best dives in to stop Scotland snatching a bizarre second try. Scotland will have a scrum, five metres out. Rob Harley is on for Ritchie, who has a nasty cut above his eye. 34 mins: More inventive attacking play from the Scottish backs, before Seymour\u2019s kick down the line is dealt with by Keith Earls. No official word on whether Sexton is returning; he was targeted by Scotland, Dell and Wilson landing huge hits on him before he went off. 32 mins: Stockdale looks isolated underneath a kick downfield, with Huw Jones bearing down on him - but keeps his cool to clear away. A terrific conversion from Greig Laidlaw, who sneaks his effort inside the far post in swirling winds. It\u2019s back on now! Scotland get the try they deserve! Laidlaw\u2019s kick is almost claimed by Seymour, but Ireland get an advantage for the knock-on. They don\u2019t use it, and Carbery\u2019s pass is intercepted cleanly by Finn Russell. The fly-half looks bound to score, but hesitates and is caught by Earls. No matter - he finds Sam Johnson who touches down instead. 26 mins: O\u2019Mahony shows he can do it all, sending a fine grubber kick down the touchline with the outside of his boot. Silky stuff, from which Scotland win a lineout under pressure... 25 mins: O\u2019Mahony, at his dominant best so far, strips the ball from Scottish hands. The counter-attack breaks down, but Ireland have a scrum, from which Jack Conan leads them to the halfway line... 24 mins: Sexton is off, replaced by Carbery - a blood replacement, for the time being at least. Hogg hasn\u2019t been missed by Scotland so far, mainly because Kinghorn has been excellent. 22 mins: Ritchie snatches the ball from an Aki knock-on, and Scotland can counter here. Kinghorn finds Seymour, who goes for the corner but runs out of room. His attempted pass run loose, and Sam Johnson tries to pin the ball against the corner flag. The play will be reviewed, and the TMO quickly establishes there was a forward pass early on. 20 mins: Ireland dominate the scrum and get a penalty. Sexton kicks for touch, but he may be nursing a groin injury. Hogg won\u2019t be returning - he has a shoulder problem, and is looking forlorn on the Scottish bench. It came from a late tackle by Peter O\u2019Mahony, but the officials took no action against the Irish flanker. 18 mins: Scotland look to respond immediately and Kinghorn breaks downfield. They get to within five metres, and win a penalty, which is taken quickly. Scotland try to set up a maul, but there\u2019s a knock on. Ireland celebrate gleefully, and Romain Poite has to cool everyone down. This has been a terrific start. This is much more like it from Ireland. From a ruck, O\u2019Mahony and Sexton combine to create space for Jacob Stockdale, who bursts through midfield and sprints downfield to score. Murray, not Sexton, lands the conversion. 15 mins: Hogg claims Sexton\u2019s kick downfield, and clears to touch - but he doesn\u2019t look comfortable, and is going to have to come off! The aforementioned Blair Kinghorn replaces him. 13 mins: Ireland looked nervous early on, but a couple of individual errors have let them back into the game. Now they\u2019re on the front foot, Seymour forced to scamper back and deal with Farrell\u2019s dangerous kick through. Ireland have an attacking lineout... Missed conversion! A short delay as Sexton gets treatment from the physio. Murray prepares to take the kick instead, but Sexton gets up - and skews it wide! Ireland regain possession and Stockdale sends a kick down the left touchline. Under pressure from Farrell, Seymour throws a poor pass towards Maitland, who can\u2019t hold it - and Conor Murray is on hand to score a simple try! 9 mins: That strong start is undone somewhat by Huw Jones, who spills Sexton\u2019s restart kick into touch. Ireland scrum on the Scottish 22, but they can\u2019t make inroads and lose patience - and Scotland turn it over! Laidlaw takes the three points, and the hosts lead after an encouraging start. 5 mins: Hogg kicks it to the corner, and Scotland win the lineout and barrel for the line. Ireland hold firm but Aki is penalised for using his hands in the ruck. Laidlaw\u2019s grubber kick is collected by Kearney, but they\u2019ll have a simple penalty chance. 3 mins: Scotland can come again, and sweep the ball from left to right, and back again, where Hogg breaks through a tackle. Advantage for the hosts - a high tackle on Ryan Wilson from Sexton. Scotland have numbers over on the far side but can\u2019t put Strauss through, and they come back for the penalty... 1 min: Hogg collects Murray\u2019s box-kick and Scotland try to put immediate pressure on. Ireland win a lineout, but Murray\u2019s second box kick is held up in the wind... Stuart Hogg hoofs his opening drop-kick high into the air, and we\u2019re off! The anthems ring out - \u2018Ireland\u2019s Call\u2019 followed by \u2018Flower of Scotland\u2019. A stirring double-header, if ever I heard one. It\u2019s on! Edinburgh\u2019s Blair Kinghorn is on the bench today after scoring three tries against Italy last weekend. I understand that his replacement, Sean Maitland, is first-choice, but should you ever drop a player after they score a hat-trick? Your thoughts welcome. \u201cIreland will be like a wounded buffalo, nostrils flared\u201d says Alan Partridg John Inverdale. Gregor Townsend\u2019s pre-match comments can be filed under \u2018bullish\u2019: \u201cWe know Ireland are going to play well. They\u2019re champions, they\u2019re a very good team. I thought England tactically played very well, but they\u2019re a different team to us. I\u2019m confident we can beat anyone in the world when we\u2019re at our best.\u201d Joe Schmidt has a chat with the BBC, and bristles at suggestions that Ireland were comprehensively beaten by England: \u201cWe were maybe a little bit underdone, we don\u2019t always start the Six Nations particularly well. I wouldn\u2019t say it was necessarily comprehensive, but we did get beaten and got beaten up. \u201cScotland are a better team than they were when we lost here [in 2017]. They\u2019ve got width across the park, and plenty in the engine room \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a massive challenge.\u201d Schmidt also names no less than seven Scottish players who offer a threat, in a Bielsa-esque summary of today\u2019s opponents. The recent beef between these two sides perhaps stems from a strange incident back in 2007, when Eddie O\u2019Sullivan accused a Scottish player of trying to choke Ronan O\u2019Gara. The former Ireland fly-half fanned the flames before Scotland\u2019s win in 2017, saying on live TV that the hosts were \u201ctoo mouthy\u201d. There\u2019s also been plenty of needle in club matches between Glasgow and Munster, with Conor Murray accusing Josh Strauss and Jonny Gray of cynical challenges in a Champions Cup game. All three men start today, and there are 19 players in total from those two regions. Pre-match reading When you\u2019re on top of the world, it\u2019s a long way down. Ireland may have been tempted before their opener with England to look beyond the Six Nations, to arriving in Japan as the kings of the north. Instead, they head to Scotland under unexpected pressure after a comprehensive defeat in Dublin. Joe Schmidt\u2019s side can expect another bruising encounter today. These two sides have a spiky recent history, with bad blood in club and international contests, and even a row over a delayed bus journey when Ireland last visited Murrayfield. That was two years ago, when Scotland shattered the visitors\u2019 grand slam hopes. A similar result again today would leave the hosts eyeing up a title tilt of their own, but Ireland will be desperate to avenge the damage done to their reputation both here in 2017, and in Dublin last Saturday.

      "body": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/03/who-are-the-gilets-jaunes-and-what-do-they-want\" title=\"\">gilets jaunes</a> movement is the longest-running protest in France since the second world war. It has lasted for 13 weeks but has mobilised fully for only 13 days \u2013 all of them Saturdays.</p> <p>In the protesters\u2019 own eyes, this is not a protest. It is an insurrection which happens mostly at the weekends. Through a series of Saturday putsches, the yellow vests hope not merely to bring down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/emmanuel-macron\" title=\"\">President Emmanuel Macron</a> but to rip up the constitution of the Fifth Republic and replace representative democracy with popular government. Their support, always limited compared with previous French rebellions, is waning. They will not give up easily or soon. They are mostly peaceful, but acts and words of great violence are committed and spoken.</p> <p>There is no simple explanation for the gilets jaunes. It is not a monolithic, single-minded movement. It has no leadership structure, no single, accepted programme of demands. That\u2019s what makes it fascinating. And worrying.</p> <p>In May last year, a young businesswoman of French West Indian origin, Priscillia Ludosky, 31, placed a petition online complaining about the high cost of petrol and diesel in France. Reaction \u2013 practically nothing. Ludosky is a calm young woman with dreadlocks who runs her own cosmetics business from home. She is an unlikely pioneer for a populist movement which is sometimes accused of being racist and far right (as parts of it undoubtedly are).</p> <p>In October she was contacted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/03/french-police-arrest-gilets-jaunes-protests-leader-eric-drouet\" title=\"\">Eric Drouet</a>, a 33-year-old lorry driver, who teamed up with her to promote her original petition. Drouet is a car fanatic, a \u201cpetrol head\u201d, but also someone with extremist political tendencies. He is now, many weeks later, probably the most influential figure in the <em>gilets jaunes</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ea02963552774135e1ad6d2fff13ccdfd7e96f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ea02963552774135e1ad6d2fff13ccdfd7e96f8/0_311_4667_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Priscillia Ludosky\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Priscillia Ludosky started the movement with her online petition against the rising cost of fuel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Feferberg/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is confusion in France about whether he should be seen as far right or far left. Drouet\u2019s original motivation may well have been his car obsession rather than his politics. Pre-gilets jaunes, he was a loud-mouthed young man more likely to watch <em>Top Gear </em>than to read <em>Das Kapital</em> or <em>Mein Kampf</em>.</p> <p>By the time he intervened, petrol prices were spiking because of a rise in world oil prices. Ludosky\u2019s original petition exploded online, attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures.</p> <p>It was Drouet, from Melun in the brie cheese country east of Paris, who thought of the idea of a nationwide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/17/french-protester-killed-accident-anti-fuel-tax-blockade\" title=\"\">protest against fuel taxes on 17 November</a>. Someone else had the brilliant PR idea of dressing everyone up in the yellow hi-vis vests that French motorists must by law carry in their cars. Petrol prices rapidly set alight other grievances in rural and outer suburban France, some concrete, some more existential: a lack of public services, the high cost of living, a new tax on some pensions, the fact that Macron had partially abolished a tax on wealth. No one should underestimate the importance of a decision last July to reduce the two-lane speed limit in France from 90kph to 80kph.</p> <p>This aroused a long-simmering belief in \u201cperipheral France\u201d that the countryside and outer suburbs are somehow subsidising the insolent success of the cities. Speeding fines, in this rural view, are just another way of taxing <em>ploucs</em> or <em>pecnos</em> \u2013 yokels or rednecks. There is also a belief that lower and middle France is taxed unfairly in favour of the rich.</p> <p>Both beliefs are factually untrue. If anything, the rich subsidise the public services of the poor and lower-middle. The metropolitan areas subsidise peripheral France.</p> <p>But it <em>is</em> true that energy, life and local sources of wealth have been sucked out of large swathes of France in recent decades \u2013 as they have in parts of Britain or the United States. All this adds up to an existential conviction that peripheral France is not only being left behind but mocked and cheated by those who are forging ahead. I believe that this resentment \u2013 a sense of being slighted or ignored or despised or abandoned or humiliated \u2013 explains the yellow-vest movement more than any particular grievance.</p> <p>The first day of action on 17 November mobilised 283,000 people across France. This figure has never been reached since. It was impressive but fell well below the numbers that have turned out for other social protests in the last 20 years. Its significance was that it took place not just in cities but also in small towns and on almost every local roundabout. Like the Tour de France, it was a national event which came \u201cdown your way\u201d.</p> <p>People who had previously felt powerless felt abruptly powerful because they could hold up cars and lorries at a roundabout. People who had been invisible became highly visible in their hi-vis vests.</p> <p>Here is our second paradox. The gilets jaunes are an internet-spawned and driven movement. They could not have existed before Facebook existed. But their attraction is that they are also something tangible, a social club as well as a social protest.</p> <p>The gilets jaunes were brought to a white-heat pitch of anger by the halls of facing mirrors of \u201canger groups\u201d online. But they also allowed people to escape from the isolation of their terminals or smartphones to come together and do things.</p> <p>The 17 November protests \u2013 Act One \u2013 were mostly peaceful. There was little violence, except a few scuffles with police in Paris and with motorists on blocked roundabouts. The government stood back and allowed the protests to happen, even though the gilets jaunes deliberately defied the law which demands advance permissions for large gatherings.</p> <p>It is important to remember this when gilets jaunes and Russian news sites allege that Macron has tried to \u201csuppress\u201d the movement.</p> <p>On 24 November, Act Two of the movement, there was some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/24/french-gilets-jaunes-protests-turn-violent-on-the-streets-of-paris\" title=\"\">violence in Paris</a>.

Gilets jaunes are convinced or have been convinced that the little or middling people like them are held in contempt by the trendy, rich, globally-oriented people of successful metropolitan France.</p> <p>That\u2019s why, I think, Macron has sparked such anger and hatred: not so much for what he has done in the past 20 months but for what he represents and some of the things he has said. He typifies the kind of person that GJs didn\u2019t like even before they were GJs or before there was Macron.</p> <p>He is the embodiment of the rich, clever, self-replicating people from the governing classes who\u2019ve been to the finishing schools of the governing elite and think they know everything.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58d47f4c0657b1c09ff52e7b7c827a1de443f3c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58d47f4c0657b1c09ff52e7b7c827a1de443f3c0/0_220_5238_3143/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eric Drouet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eric Drouet had the idea of calling national protests and the movement exploded into action.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zakaria Abdelkafi/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so to the second word or phrase you hear: <em>ras le bol</em>, which means sick to the teeth. It conveys a sense of having been pushed to the breaking point. In my experience, French people almost always have a sense of <em>ras le bol</em> about something or other. But the white-hot anger of the GJ movement is something new and different. It can only be explained, I think, by the silos of facing mirrors of social media sites, which fill heads with exaggerated versions of real grievances blended with complete bullshit.</p> <p>\u201cFrance has been sold to the UN\u201d; \u201cAlsace has been given back to Germany\u201d; \u201cPoliticians are living high on the hog \u2013 if we sweep them away, we can have lower taxes <em>and</em> higher welfare payments\u201d; \u201cBrigitte Macron, as first lady, earns \u20ac550,000 a year from the state\u201d. Actually she earns, nothing, zero, <em>rien</em>.</p> <p>This nonsense is always accompanied, as it often is in the United States and Britain, by a message telling you that the mainstream media is lying. Thus suspicion of the media, already high, is cranked to the point where journalists, newspapers and radio stations have become targets for GJ violence.</p> <p>The gilets jaunes rapidly moved from a protest movement with specific demands to a revolutionary movement of unlikely revolutionaries. The view in much of the foreign media is that these are anti-Macron protests. And they are. But they go way beyond him and call for the sluicing out of the entire political class, left and right, even hard left and hard right, to be replaced by a bottom-up, direct democracy of permanent popular decisions by referendums.</p> <p>Thus we have a revolution which did not just start on the internet and Facebook but wants to use the internet to impose a new form of government and yet is at the same time anti-globalist and nostalgic for a simpler, more traditional kind of France. Yet another paradox.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e946572a30c0d2116d5d7bcd44c39519c588b11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e946572a30c0d2116d5d7bcd44c39519c588b11/0_40_1970_1182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Riot police\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Riot police stand in position during clashes with demonstrators in Paris, on 1 December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The movement is now splitting. Some gilets jaunes have decided to enter the mainstream political system to try to reform it or destroy it from the inside. Three rival GJ lists, broadly left, right and centrist, are being prepared for the European elections in May.</p> <p>An extraordinary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/07/france-italy-ambassador-macron-di-maio-salvini-second-world-war\" title=\"\">diplomatic row</a> exploded last week when the Italian deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, leader of the populist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/five-star-movement\" title=\"\">Five Star Movement</a>, arrived unannounced in the south Paris suburbs for a photo opportunity with one of these electoral lists.</p> <p>France withdrew its ambassador from Rome in protest. It emerged that Di Maio had been invited by Christophe Chalen\u00e7on, a <em>g</em>ilets jaunes figure with far-right connections, not by the leader of the list, Ingrid Levavasseur. She described both Di Maio and Chalen\u00e7on as \u201csharks\u201d.</p> <p>All of this may help Macron. He is already recovering strongly in the opinion polls as well-heeled, urban France turns to him to save them from yellow chaos. He has made \u20ac10bn of concessions to motorists and the low-paid. He has started a \u201cgreat national debate\u201d in hundreds of village and town meetings.</p> <p>Even one yellow vest list in the European elections will take votes from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/01/marine-le-pen-rebrands-front-national-in-push-for-support\" title=\"\">Marine Le Pen\u2019s Rassemblement National</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jean-luc-melenchon\" title=\"\">Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon</a>\u2019s far-left La France Insoumise. For Macron\u2019s party to top the European poll in France would be a \u201cmid-term\u201d triumph.</p> <p>There is talk of Emmanuel Macron calling a referendum on the same day as the EU poll on 26May to take further wind from the sails of the gilets jaunes. This is probably a silly idea. Senior ministers are campaigning against it.</p> <p>If the referendum asks marginal questions \u2013 ie should there be fewer French MPs? \u2013 it will seem like a betrayal of the promise of Macron\u2019s \u201cgreat debate\u201d. If it asks explosive questions \u2013 should Macron resign? Should he push ahead with his state-shrinking reform programme? \u2013 the results could be catastrophic for him.</p> <p>LeVavasseur, an auxiliary nurse from Normandy, is one of the more thoughtful gilets jaunes (and therefore detested by many others). She is leading one of the GJ lists in the European elections. Asked to sum up yellow-vest demands in a single sentence, she said: \u201cThat we should feel recognised and valued.\u201d</p> <p>The anger of the gilets jaunes is understandable. What is scary is their fury. Where does that come from? What explains the radicalisation of home carers and garage mechanics in small towns who don\u2019t understand the basics of how their own country\u2019s political and tax system works but want to tear them both down?</p> <p>That fury has many sources but its depth and strength can only be explained by the compound or viral effect of social media. The gilets jaunes are a French phenomenon and a French crisis.</p> <p>They also point to a wider, existential crisis for 21st-century democracies.</p> <p><em>This article is adapted from a talk given to a conference of the Brussels European Employee Relations Group</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The gilets jaunes movement is the longest-running protest in France since the second world war. It has lasted for 13 weeks but has mobilised fully for only 13 days \u2013 all of them Saturdays. In the protesters\u2019 own eyes, this is not a protest. It is an insurrection which happens mostly at the weekends. Through a series of Saturday putsches, the yellow vests hope not merely to bring down President Emmanuel Macron but to rip up the constitution of the Fifth Republic and replace representative democracy with popular government. Their support, always limited compared with previous French rebellions, is waning. They will not give up easily or soon. They are mostly peaceful, but acts and words of great violence are committed and spoken. There is no simple explanation for the gilets jaunes. It is not a monolithic, single-minded movement. It has no leadership structure, no single, accepted programme of demands. That\u2019s what makes it fascinating. And worrying. In May last year, a young businesswoman of French West Indian origin, Priscillia Ludosky, 31, placed a petition online complaining about the high cost of petrol and diesel in France. Reaction \u2013 practically nothing. Ludosky is a calm young woman with dreadlocks who runs her own cosmetics business from home. She is an unlikely pioneer for a populist movement which is sometimes accused of being racist and far right (as parts of it undoubtedly are). In October she was contacted by Eric Drouet, a 33-year-old lorry driver, who teamed up with her to promote her original petition. Drouet is a car fanatic, a \u201cpetrol head\u201d, but also someone with extremist political tendencies. He is now, many weeks later, probably the most influential figure in the gilets jaunes. There is confusion in France about whether he should be seen as far right or far left. Drouet\u2019s original motivation may well have been his car obsession rather than his politics. Pre-gilets jaunes, he was a loud-mouthed young man more likely to watch Top Gear than to read Das Kapital or Mein Kampf. By the time he intervened, petrol prices were spiking because of a rise in world oil prices. Ludosky\u2019s original petition exploded online, attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures. It was Drouet, from Melun in the brie cheese country east of Paris, who thought of the idea of a nationwide protest against fuel taxes on 17 November. Someone else had the brilliant PR idea of dressing everyone up in the yellow hi-vis vests that French motorists must by law carry in their cars. Petrol prices rapidly set alight other grievances in rural and outer suburban France, some concrete, some more existential: a lack of public services, the high cost of living, a new tax on some pensions, the fact that Macron had partially abolished a tax on wealth. No one should underestimate the importance of a decision last July to reduce the two-lane speed limit in France from 90kph to 80kph. This aroused a long-simmering belief in \u201cperipheral France\u201d that the countryside and outer suburbs are somehow subsidising the insolent success of the cities. Speeding fines, in this rural view, are just another way of taxing ploucs or pecnos \u2013 yokels or rednecks. There is also a belief that lower and middle France is taxed unfairly in favour of the rich. Both beliefs are factually untrue. If anything, the rich subsidise the public services of the poor and lower-middle. The metropolitan areas subsidise peripheral France. But it is true that energy, life and local sources of wealth have been sucked out of large swathes of France in recent decades \u2013 as they have in parts of Britain or the United States. All this adds up to an existential conviction that peripheral France is not only being left behind but mocked and cheated by those who are forging ahead. I believe that this resentment \u2013 a sense of being slighted or ignored or despised or abandoned or humiliated \u2013 explains the yellow-vest movement more than any particular grievance. The first day of action on 17 November mobilised 283,000 people across France. This figure has never been reached since. It was impressive but fell well below the numbers that have turned out for other social protests in the last 20 years. Its significance was that it took place not just in cities but also in small towns and on almost every local roundabout. Like the Tour de France, it was a national event which came \u201cdown your way\u201d. People who had previously felt powerless felt abruptly powerful because they could hold up cars and lorries at a roundabout. People who had been invisible became highly visible in their hi-vis vests. Here is our second paradox. The gilets jaunes are an internet-spawned and driven movement. They could not have existed before Facebook existed. But their attraction is that they are also something tangible, a social club as well as a social protest. The gilets jaunes were brought to a white-heat pitch of anger by the halls of facing mirrors of \u201canger groups\u201d online. But they also allowed people to escape from the isolation of their terminals or smartphones to come together and do things. The 17 November protests \u2013 Act One \u2013 were mostly peaceful. There was little violence, except a few scuffles with police in Paris and with motorists on blocked roundabouts. The government stood back and allowed the protests to happen, even though the gilets jaunes deliberately defied the law which demands advance permissions for large gatherings. It is important to remember this when gilets jaunes and Russian news sites allege that Macron has tried to \u201csuppress\u201d the movement. On 24 November, Act Two of the movement, there was some violence in Paris. Police responded robustly to being attacked by a militant fringe of protesters on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. There were several serious injuries from police weapons. This was treated on GJ sites as deliberate police violence and repression, stoking tempers for the next weekend. On 1 December, Act Three, I was out on streets of Paris from early morning. I happen to live near the Arc de Triomphe, and when I left my building at 9am I walked out into the middle of a street battle. A number of yellow vests \u2013 not just hard left and right militants but rural or provincial disaffected men and women in their 20s, 30s and 40s \u2013 attacked police from early morning. The Arc de Triomphe was tagged with graffiti. Police were pelted with acid, paint, iron bolts, stones and bottles. Buildings around the \u00c9toile were set briefly alight. A mob surged down the Avenue Kl\u00e9ber, overturning and burning cars and smashing bank, shop and restaurant windows. Before the next Saturday \u2013 Act Four on 8 December \u2013 there were dark reports that there would be an insurrection, using live weapons and explosives. Macron, shaken, visited the \u00c9lys\u00e9e nuclear bunker to make sure there was a place that he could take refuge. In the event, 8 December was again a violent day \u2013 not just in Paris but in several cities. It was not the feared revolution. The violence this time was mostly provoked by militia of the hard right and hard left. Some \u201cordinary\u201d GJs waded in. Police were more aggressive in their response. Since then there have been nine further Acts or Saturday putsches, some more violent than others, some better supported than others. Violence has switched from Paris for the most part to provincial cities, especially Toulouse, Bordeaux, Caen, Rouen and Rennes. The numbers taking part have fallen to around 60,000. The roundabout rebellion is almost over. Support in rural areas is slackening. In early December my own unscientific poll of yellow vests placed on car dashboards in rural Normandy was 40%. It\u2019s now 10% to 14%. There has been no systematic attempt to repress protest. But the police\u2019s so-called defensive weapons \u2013 rubber bullets and stun grenades \u2013 have become a serious problem that the government has been too slow to recognise. Seventeen eyes and four hands have been lost so far. That is unacceptable, whoever is initially responsible for the violence. Is this just the French being the French? Not really. It\u2019s true that protest goes to the street in France more rapidly than in almost any other democratic country. There is a default position in the country that social demands will not be taken seriously without street demos, and demos will not be taken seriously without a dose of violence. But there is also something very un-French about the gilets jaunes movement. It has, first of all, broken all the unspoken and spoken rules of French manifestations. Protests are usually choreographed within certain limits, with agreed venues and routes and marshals. Riots happen but they are predictable riots. The gilets jaunes refused from the beginning to be bound by any of these rules, although this is now changing. The movement, supposedly peaceful, allowed its own violent fringe as well as opportunist, urban, state-hating militia of hard right and hard left to take over. The violence is not limited to the Saturdays-only protests in French cities. There have been scores of arson and other attacks on the offices of MPs who support Macron. There have been attacks on motorways toll-booths, newspapers and radio stations. A starred restaurant whose boss criticised the gilets jaunes was burned. Town halls, prefectures and other public buildings have been vandalised. The gilets jaunes are also un-French \u2013 or at least atypical \u2013 because they have not come from the usual or expected sources of protest: unions, farmers, students, the multi-racial banlieues. They come from a section of French society that is usually invisible, permanently grumpy but little engaged in politics. I mean rural, non-farming France, small town France, outer suburban France. I mean many people who have not voted for years, as well as many who have voted hard right or hard left. Gilets jaunes do include people at the bottom of society, the unemployed, the marginalised, but more typically they are people who are above the bottom but think that they should be doing better. They are people with low-paid jobs or pensioners or artisans or small business people or technicians or people at the lower level of the caring professions. This mixture of supporters explains in part the heterogenous character and demands of the movement, which point both left and right, to higher welfare payments and pensions but also to lower taxes, to less state and more state. There is no coherent ideology, even a refusal of ideology. Some see this as a camouflage for a movement whose heart beats on the far right. But many of the usual far-right hot topics \u2013 migration, Islam, abortion, gay marriage, Europe \u2013 are not the first things that you hear on the lips of gilets jaunes. What are the sources of grievance and how justified are they? Here it is difficult to prise apart French and un-French elements. The words you hear most often are m\u00e9pris and ras le bol. M\u00e9pris means contempt. Gilets jaunes are convinced or have been convinced that the little or middling people like them are held in contempt by the trendy, rich, globally-oriented people of successful metropolitan France. That\u2019s why, I think, Macron has sparked such anger and hatred: not so much for what he has done in the past 20 months but for what he represents and some of the things he has said. He typifies the kind of person that GJs didn\u2019t like even before they were GJs or before there was Macron. He is the embodiment of the rich, clever, self-replicating people from the governing classes who\u2019ve been to the finishing schools of the governing elite and think they know everything. And so to the second word or phrase you hear: ras le bol, which means sick to the teeth. It conveys a sense of having been pushed to the breaking point. In my experience, French people almost always have a sense of ras le bol about something or other. But the white-hot anger of the GJ movement is something new and different. It can only be explained, I think, by the silos of facing mirrors of social media sites, which fill heads with exaggerated versions of real grievances blended with complete bullshit. \u201cFrance has been sold to the UN\u201d; \u201cAlsace has been given back to Germany\u201d; \u201cPoliticians are living high on the hog \u2013 if we sweep them away, we can have lower taxes and higher welfare payments\u201d; \u201cBrigitte Macron, as first lady, earns \u20ac550,000 a year from the state\u201d. Actually she earns, nothing, zero, rien. This nonsense is always accompanied, as it often is in the United States and Britain, by a message telling you that the mainstream media is lying.

Yet another paradox. The movement is now splitting. Some gilets jaunes have decided to enter the mainstream political system to try to reform it or destroy it from the inside. Three rival GJ lists, broadly left, right and centrist, are being prepared for the European elections in May. An extraordinary diplomatic row exploded last week when the Italian deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, leader of the populist Five Star Movement, arrived unannounced in the south Paris suburbs for a photo opportunity with one of these electoral lists. France withdrew its ambassador from Rome in protest. It emerged that Di Maio had been invited by Christophe Chalen\u00e7on, a gilets jaunes figure with far-right connections, not by the leader of the list, Ingrid Levavasseur. She described both Di Maio and Chalen\u00e7on as \u201csharks\u201d. All of this may help Macron. He is already recovering strongly in the opinion polls as well-heeled, urban France turns to him to save them from yellow chaos. He has made \u20ac10bn of concessions to motorists and the low-paid. He has started a \u201cgreat national debate\u201d in hundreds of village and town meetings. Even one yellow vest list in the European elections will take votes from Marine Le Pen\u2019s Rassemblement National and Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s far-left La France Insoumise. For Macron\u2019s party to top the European poll in France would be a \u201cmid-term\u201d triumph. There is talk of Emmanuel Macron calling a referendum on the same day as the EU poll on 26May to take further wind from the sails of the gilets jaunes. This is probably a silly idea. Senior ministers are campaigning against it. If the referendum asks marginal questions \u2013 ie should there be fewer French MPs? \u2013 it will seem like a betrayal of the promise of Macron\u2019s \u201cgreat debate\u201d. If it asks explosive questions \u2013 should Macron resign? Should he push ahead with his state-shrinking reform programme? \u2013 the results could be catastrophic for him. LeVavasseur, an auxiliary nurse from Normandy, is one of the more thoughtful gilets jaunes (and therefore detested by many others). She is leading one of the GJ lists in the European elections. Asked to sum up yellow-vest demands in a single sentence, she said: \u201cThat we should feel recognised and valued.\u201d The anger of the gilets jaunes is understandable. What is scary is their fury. Where does that come from? What explains the radicalisation of home carers and garage mechanics in small towns who don\u2019t understand the basics of how their own country\u2019s political and tax system works but want to tear them both down? That fury has many sources but its depth and strength can only be explained by the compound or viral effect of social media. The gilets jaunes are a French phenomenon and a French crisis. They also point to a wider, existential crisis for 21st-century democracies. This article is adapted from a talk given to a conference of the Brussels European Employee Relations Group",

      "body": "<p>Lotta Sonninen was working on her third book in quick succession on positivity, when she suddenly realised her own positivity had drained clean away. \u201cAll those invitations to perk up, smile, find the happiness in everything were getting on my nerves,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought, hang on a minute. I\u2019m sick and tired of finding the good in everything. What if we started to play with the opposite of all this \u2013 our negative emotions, the feelings we all have inside us that we\u2019re not being encouraged to share? I thought, I wonder what\u2019s happening to these emotions \u2013 and could we do something with them more useful than burying them?\u201d</p> <p>She started making lists that were the antidote to the mindfulness and positivity books she was translating: so instead of listing what she had to be grateful for, or what was lucky in her life, she turned to all the negative stuff in her life. All the angst and agony; all the silent anger and pent-up frustrations. How about a list of all those acquaintances and celebrities who\u2019d obviously had it far too easy? And next, what about naming all those arrogant folk who thought oh-so-much of themselves? And those people who seemed not to have clocked that you really need to think before you open your mouth? And how about writing down the names of all those infuriating people who were clearly far less talented than her, but somehow way more successful?</p> <p>After that, she turned to social media. What were the comments that made her want to throw her phone against the wall? She trawled Facebook for the most infuriating status updates; surfed Instagram for the stupidest comments; scoured Twitter for the most birdbrained tweets. Next, she mused on which emojis really deserved to be punched in the face and, in fact, what new emoji should she design, one that did justice to her new-found anger, rage and frustration. How come so many emojis showcased cheeriness and buoyancy, and hardly any were designed to reflect the important emotions of malaise, gloom and despondency?</p> <p>\u201cIt started as a private joke: a counterstrike against all that upbeat positivity,\u201d says Sonninen. But as she tentatively began to share her secret negativity project with friends in Helsinki, where she\u2019s a book editor and translator of texts from English into Finnish, it was clear she had tapped into a rich seam.</p> <p>\u201cAll that ranting and raving we found ourselves doing was so cleansing and purifying,\u201d she says. \u201cWe began to realise what a relief it was just to acknowledge our negative feelings. Often they felt so petty, but it was still good to get them out there.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The smallness of what upset me really made me laugh</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And yet, she figured, maybe it wasn\u2019t all that surprising: Finland\u2019s dark winter days (when we speak it\u2019s midday in Helsinki, but still barely light) help explain the culture of appreciating the noir side of life.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pessimism in Finnish culture,\u201d she says. \u201cWe love to revel in a bad mood, and we definitely don\u2019t spend enough time discussing our feelings.\u201d</p> <p>So Sonninen wrote what she describes as an anti-mindfulness book, <em>The Little Book of Bad Moods</em> (sell: \u201cFind the misery in every day and let go of nothing\u201d) thinking it would have some appeal in her native country. But what soon became clear, she says, is that gloom is universal, and all of us want to vent our gripes, at least some of the time. The book has now been published in 30 countries and rising, with Indonesia, China and Japan among them. And while she says she wouldn\u2019t go so far as to suggest you actually <em>do</em> the exercises the book describes, she sure as hell thinks you\u2019ll feel liberated just imagining them: we\u2019re talking, for example, about pages with space to write down ways to irritate your partner; tactics to upset your colleagues; strategies to be annoying online.</p> <p>It also turned out that, like all the best jokes in life, there was something very serious at the heart of what Sonninen was exploring. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be preachy,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I noticed that when you focus on the negative, it\u2019s easy to blame others. Because you can always blame someone other than yourself, for anything in your life.\u201d</p> <p>And while that can be genuinely cathartic, it\u2019s not usually a key to self-improvement beyond that. \u201cThe book stays a joke if you want it to,\u201d says Sonninen, \u201cbut if you allow this, it can turn into an exercise of real self-exploration,\u201d because we all know there\u2019s only one person we can ever truly change in life \u2013 and it\u2019s not someone else. The book can also, she promises, prompt a huge amount of fun and laughter \u2013 and the person you\u2019re going to find yourself laughing at will be yourself. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how much we sweat the small stuff, and how much we let other people annoy us. As I started to make my lists and think about my negative feelings, the smallness of so much of what upsets me really made me laugh,\u201d says Sonninen.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Stuff from my teenage years had sunk deep and stayed there</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another thing that played on her mind was that all the mindfulness/creativity/positivity books currently flooding the market are aimed mostly at women: women who surely already have more than enough to do, without being required to squeeze mindfulness and positivity into the slender crevices of their day. \u201cIt felt like another duty \u2013 something else that was required of us, on top of everything else.\u201d She certainly knows what she\u2019s talking about on that score: as well as being a successful fiction editor, Sonninen, 43, has translated books including <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fifty-shades-of-grey\" title=\"\">Fifty Shades of Grey</a></em> and Lena Denham\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/30/not-that-kind-of-girl-lena-dunham-review-memoir\" title=\"\">Not That Kind of Girl</a></em>. On the home front, she\u2019s mother to three-month-old twins, Voitto and Taisto; and just to make things busier still, she also plays in a band, and does the occasional bit of stand-up comedy. So, yes, mindfulness: bring it on, in that five-minute window she gets once a fortnight.</p> <p>One thing Sonninen was surprised about, as she mined her memories for people who had wronged or upset or injured her, was how painful those events still felt \u2013 even decades down the line. \u201cI hadn\u2019t expected how much old things would turn out to be still bothering me \u2013 stuff from my teenage years that had sunk deep and stayed there.\u201d Perhaps, she mused, we <em>need</em> to revisit these painful situations, instead of continually brushing over them in our constant quest for all that\u2019s good and wholesome and positive. There may be things you still have to say to that ex you think is a bloodsucking vampire, or the teacher who humiliated you when you were seven in front of the whole class, or the friend who chose to ghost rather than support you. These hurts go deep, and the pain lies dormant until we pull them out of their box, shake them down and feel all those feelings once again, before \u2013 hopefully \u2013 letting them go. \u201cI think giving your feelings a name helps: once a feeling has a label, you know what it\u2019s about and why it\u2019s there. That makes it easier to cope with: and then you can set it aside, and even move on from it.\u201d</p> <h2>How to channel your bad moods</h2> <p>\u2022 Buried negative emotions can be stressful: you can channel too much of yourself into keeping them in check or repressed. It might feel as though avoiding anger or negativity will stop you feeling those things \u2013 but it takes a lot of effort to avoid them, and that\u2019s effort you could better direct elsewhere. And anger can be helpful: it can certainly help you understand yourself better, because by thinking about what upsets or annoys you, you become more aware of your personal values.</p> <p>\u2022 Acknowledging these feelings, and feeling what they mean us to feel, can also allow you to let them go and move on. All feelings are there for a reason: the important thing is to decode the feelings, to see if there\u2019s a useful message to take from them, and if there is, to think about it. Frustration, anger and anxiety are all feelings that point to a need for change.</p> <p>\u2022 Take a leaf out of Sonninen\u2019s book and write down what\u2019s most annoying you right now (don\u2019t worry, you can destroy the piece of paper afterwards). Is it your partner? Your kids? Your parents? A friend? A colleague? Why are you annoyed with them? What\u2019s most irritating about the situation? How does it make you feel? Have a cup of tea, then read what you\u2019ve written and see whether this helps you decipher what you can do to change the situation. But remember: there\u2019s only one person it\u2019s ever going to be possible to change\u2026</p> <p><em>The Little Book of Bad Moods by Lotta Sonninen is published in the UK by Bloomsbury at \u00a35.99.

      "body": "<p>When David Begg first approached pubs around the UK about the possibility of stocking non-alcoholic <a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/health-benefits-kombucha\" title=\"\">kombucha</a> drinks, he was greeted with a mixture of bewilderment and defiance.</p> <p>\u201cBack then, there were still a lot of pub owners saying, \u2018My pub is for people who want to drink alcohol. I want to sell beer and wine,\u2019\u201d says Begg, an entrepreneur who founded <a href=\"https://realkombucha.co.uk\" title=\"\">Real Kombucha</a> towards the end of 2017.</p> <p>Fast forward 18 months and the naturally fizzy drink, made from fermented tea, has rapidly moved from its hipster beginnings to the mainstream. After initial rejections, Begg\u2019s kombucha range will soon be stocked in more than 1,000 pubs across the country. This change of tack is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/oct/11/kombucha-can-the-fermented-drink-compete-with-beer-at-the-bar\">evident across the pub and bar industry</a>, driven by a growing demand for a wider choice of non-alcoholic drinks, especially among the health-conscious millennial generation.</p> <p>\u201cThere are stats showing <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/news/lifestyle-and-exercise/young-people-turning-their-backs-alcohol/\">that nearly 30% of young adults</a> aren\u2019t drinking alcohol,\u201d says Neil Hinchley, director of the Crate Brewery, based in Hackney, east London, which is currently installing three new taps of home-brewed kombucha. \u201cWe certainly see that at the bar. We have people coming in and asking for the non-alcoholic drinks menu and they expect more than just orange juice, lemonade and J2O. You hear about more people wanting to go out, have a good time, but without alcohol. They want something to fill that space and kombucha ticks a lot of boxes because it has that healthy reputation. It\u2019s had a gradual rise, but it\u2019s now hit its tipping point.\u201d</p> <p>This tipping point has coincided with the rapid rise of fermented foods in general, a market that is <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-fermented-ingredients-market-worth-us-40-billion-by-2022---persistence-market-research-643700373.html\" title=\"\">expected to top \u00a330bn by 2022</a>, thanks to the booming wellness industry. British supermarkets now regularly stock ranges of sauerkraut and the Korean vegetable side dish kimchi, while fermented milk drinks such as kefir can be found everywhere from Tesco to fast food chain Leon.

As fermentation is a form of predigestion, these foods are also thought to be more easily processed by people with irritable bowel syndrome or digestive issues.</p> <p>But digestion aside, scientists have so far struggled to demonstrate a clear cause and effect between consuming fermented food and improved health. Much of the media excitement has revolved around the supposed ability of these foods to improve the balance of healthy bacteria in the gut, but in reality microbiologists say that a few spoonfuls of yoghurt or kimchi will make little or no difference to this vast colony of microbes.</p> <p>\u201cInside our gut, each of us has at least 100tn microbes,\u201d says Prof Zhaoping Li, head of clinical nutrition at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cEven if one of these foods contains 100m microbes, it\u2019s very trivial in comparison.

These have so far returned mixed results, with the studies often containing severe flaws in their design.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re typically looking at something like blood pressure over 21 or 28 days,\u201d says Robert Hutkins, a professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who researches the link between fermented foods and human health. \u201cBut blood pressure varies ordinarily, so you really need to study it over 90 or 120 days to have any idea if there\u2019s a significant change.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the other claims have come from population studies that compare parts of the world where people eat a high proportion of fermented foods with places where they don\u2019t and analyse the relative prevalence of different diseases. But these types of studies are vague and notoriously difficult to interpret.</p> <p>\u201cKoreans have a lower risk factor for bowel disease than Americans,\u201d Li says, \u201cbut that isn\u2019t necessarily because they eat more fermented foods. It could be genetics or because they eat more fish or the fact that overeating is less common. There are so many potential confounding factors at play.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Lack of regulation</strong></h2> <p>Because the rise in popularity in fermented foods in the UK is a relatively recent phenomenon, the industry is in many ways, a bit of a wild west. Hutkins admits that most of the clinical trials conducted on these foods have been funded directly by the companies trying to sell them, such as Danone or Nestl\u00e9, while there\u2019s currently little or no regulation covering the labelling or manufacturing process of fermented products.</p> <p>As a result, scientists say that fermented foods found on supermarket shelves can have high sugar or sodium contents.

      "bodyText": "When David Begg first approached pubs around the UK about the possibility of stocking non-alcoholic kombucha drinks, he was greeted with a mixture of bewilderment and defiance. \u201cBack then, there were still a lot of pub owners saying, \u2018My pub is for people who want to drink alcohol. I want to sell beer and wine,\u2019\u201d says Begg, an entrepreneur who founded Real Kombucha towards the end of 2017. Fast forward 18 months and the naturally fizzy drink, made from fermented tea, has rapidly moved from its hipster beginnings to the mainstream. After initial rejections, Begg\u2019s kombucha range will soon be stocked in more than 1,000 pubs across the country. This change of tack is evident across the pub and bar industry, driven by a growing demand for a wider choice of non-alcoholic drinks, especially among the health-conscious millennial generation. \u201cThere are stats showing that nearly 30% of young adults aren\u2019t drinking alcohol,\u201d says Neil Hinchley, director of the Crate Brewery, based in Hackney, east London, which is currently installing three new taps of home-brewed kombucha. \u201cWe certainly see that at the bar. We have people coming in and asking for the non-alcoholic drinks menu and they expect more than just orange juice, lemonade and J2O. You hear about more people wanting to go out, have a good time, but without alcohol. They want something to fill that space and kombucha ticks a lot of boxes because it has that healthy reputation. It\u2019s had a gradual rise, but it\u2019s now hit its tipping point.\u201d This tipping point has coincided with the rapid rise of fermented foods in general, a market that is expected to top \u00a330bn by 2022, thanks to the booming wellness industry.

      "body": "<h2>Film and TV: Netflix</h2> <p>Netflix has helped change the way we watch television and film, further weakening our reliance on traditional TV schedules and providing a cheaper alternative to a cinema trip.</p> <p>It invested massively in shows such as <em>The Crown</em>, <em>Stranger Things </em>and <em>House of Cards</em> to drive subscriber growth. It is now spending money on locking in talent, including <em>Grey\u2019s Anatomy</em> creator Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy, the producer behind <em>American Horror Story</em>, to try to ensure its supply of high-quality content.</p> <p>This comes at a cost: content, marketing and other expenses are thought to have exceeded subscriber revenue by at least $3bn last year. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/17/netflix-adds-subscribers-stock-falls-fourth-quarter-earnings\" title=\"\">Net debt was $8.34bn at the end of September</a>. Netflix also faces increasing competition from tech giants Amazon and Apple, and from traditional media players including Disney and WarnerMedia, which are planning to launch streaming services.</p> <h2>Retail: Amazon</h2> <p>For Jeff Bezos, the path to world domination began in his garage, where he personally prepared customer orders and drove them to the post office. That\u2019s hard to imagine now, when Amazon employs more than 600,000 people and ships billions of packages a year with the help of robots in giant warehouses.</p> <p>Amazon strikes fear into retailers around the world as they struggle to compete. In the UK, the dominance of Amazon has become almost synonymous with the shift to online spending and the decline in high streets.</p> <p>Like other tech giants, it has been criticised for using complex corporate structures to avoid tax in numerous countries. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/23/amazon-knocked-off-top-of-uk-consumer-poll-once-ethics-considered\" title=\"\">Its employment practices have also come under scrutiny</a>. But Amazon charges on, seeking other sectors to disrupt \u2013 cloud computing, healthcare and electronic payments to name but three. Its smart devices are making their way into our homes, and it is developing robots to drop packages on our doorsteps.</p> <h2>Transport: Uber</h2> <p>Ride hailing firm Uber has radically changed urban transport, and stirred up no end of controversy. Its smartphone app has generally been a runaway success with users, providing a flexible, cashless alternative to traditional taxis and public transport.</p> <p>It ran into opposition from authorities in many cities, however, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/22/uber-licence-transport-for-london-tfl\" title=\"\">London declined to renew its operating licence in 2017</a>. Beset by scandals, including allegations of sexual harassment, Uber has tried to chart a calmer, more conciliatory course since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/27/former-general-electric-boss-jeffrey-immelt-rules-himself-out-of-uber-role\" title=\"\">Dara Khosrowshahi</a> replaced Travis Kalanick as chief executive.</p> <h2>Automotive: Tesla</h2> <p>Founded by a man with ambitions to fly 100 people to Mars, Tesla was never going to be a traditional car manufacturer. Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk aims to make Tesla a leader in electric cars and put it at the forefront of driverless technology. He said last year that he was confident Tesla would win the race to produce a fully self-driving vehicle, before the end of 2019. </p> <p>Last year, the company faced production problems with its mass-market Model 3 car, and had to pay out $40m over tweets by Musk about taking the firm into private ownership.</p> <h2>Energy: \u00d8rsted</h2> <p>\u00d8rsted may not be a household name, but it is undeniably a disruptor in an industry that is undergoing a period of drastic change. Formerly an oil and gas company, the Danish firm has transformed itself into a leader in offshore wind, and is behind the world\u2019s biggest offshore wind farm, opened in the Irish Sea last September. </p> <h2>Music: Spotify</h2> <p>Spotify has become a global leader in music streaming and is one of the world\u2019s best-known tech companies. It has transformed the way we listen to music, giving listeners instant access to pretty much any track. There have been bumps along the way, and it is a low-margin business, with a majority of revenues paid in royalties to music companies.</p> <p>But it has just reported its first quarterly profit, and its paying subscribers hit 96 million in the fourth quarter, up 36% on the same period a year earlier. In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/28/hmv-on-brink-second-collapse-administration\" title=\"\">HMV\u2019s collapse</a> in December for the second time in six years was a clear sign of just how tough it is for traditional music retailers to compete with the disruptors.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Film and TV: Netflix Netflix has helped change the way we watch television and film, further weakening our reliance on traditional TV schedules and providing a cheaper alternative to a cinema trip. It invested massively in shows such as The Crown, Stranger Things and House of Cards to drive subscriber growth. It is now spending money on locking in talent, including Grey\u2019s Anatomy creator Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy, the producer behind American Horror Story, to try to ensure its supply of high-quality content. This comes at a cost: content, marketing and other expenses are thought to have exceeded subscriber revenue by at least $3bn last year. Net debt was $8.34bn at the end of September. Netflix also faces increasing competition from tech giants Amazon and Apple, and from traditional media players including Disney and WarnerMedia, which are planning to launch streaming services. Retail: Amazon For Jeff Bezos, the path to world domination began in his garage, where he personally prepared customer orders and drove them to the post office. That\u2019s hard to imagine now, when Amazon employs more than 600,000 people and ships billions of packages a year with the help of robots in giant warehouses. Amazon strikes fear into retailers around the world as they struggle to compete. In the UK, the dominance of Amazon has become almost synonymous with the shift to online spending and the decline in high streets. Like other tech giants, it has been criticised for using complex corporate structures to avoid tax in numerous countries. Its employment practices have also come under scrutiny. But Amazon charges on, seeking other sectors to disrupt \u2013 cloud computing, healthcare and electronic payments to name but three. Its smart devices are making their way into our homes, and it is developing robots to drop packages on our doorsteps. Transport: Uber Ride hailing firm Uber has radically changed urban transport, and stirred up no end of controversy. Its smartphone app has generally been a runaway success with users, providing a flexible, cashless alternative to traditional taxis and public transport. It ran into opposition from authorities in many cities, however, and London declined to renew its operating licence in 2017. Beset by scandals, including allegations of sexual harassment, Uber has tried to chart a calmer, more conciliatory course since Dara Khosrowshahi replaced Travis Kalanick as chief executive. Automotive: Tesla Founded by a man with ambitions to fly 100 people to Mars, Tesla was never going to be a traditional car manufacturer. Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk aims to make Tesla a leader in electric cars and put it at the forefront of driverless technology. He said last year that he was confident Tesla would win the race to produce a fully self-driving vehicle, before the end of 2019. Last year, the company faced production problems with its mass-market Model 3 car, and had to pay out $40m over tweets by Musk about taking the firm into private ownership. Energy: \u00d8rsted \u00d8rsted may not be a household name, but it is undeniably a disruptor in an industry that is undergoing a period of drastic change. Formerly an oil and gas company, the Danish firm has transformed itself into a leader in offshore wind, and is behind the world\u2019s biggest offshore wind farm, opened in the Irish Sea last September. Music: Spotify Spotify has become a global leader in music streaming and is one of the world\u2019s best-known tech companies. It has transformed the way we listen to music, giving listeners instant access to pretty much any track. There have been bumps along the way, and it is a low-margin business, with a majority of revenues paid in royalties to music companies. But it has just reported its first quarterly profit, and its paying subscribers hit 96 million in the fourth quarter, up 36% on the same period a year earlier. In the UK, HMV\u2019s collapse in December for the second time in six years was a clear sign of just how tough it is for traditional music retailers to compete with the disruptors.",

Updated from pious 19th-century Russian village to godless 1970s suburb, an already shattering work gains yet wider traction and force.</p> <p>Based on Alexander Ostrovsky\u2019s play <em>The Thunderstorm</em>, <em>K\u00e1t\u2019a Kabanov\u00e1</em> is part of the Royal Opera\u2019s ongoing Jan\u00e1\u010dek series, which began last year with <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/11/from-the-house-of-the-dead-roh-midsummer-nights-dream-eno-rcm-reviews\" title=\"\">From the House of the Dead</a></em>. Trevor Nunn\u2019s 1994 production of <em>K\u00e1t\u2019a </em>\u2013 astonishingly the ROH\u2019s first; Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s star has risen rapidly since \u2013 had its final revival in 2007. Jones\u2019s staging deserves a similarly long life, and if Gardner, a natural in this repertoire, is conducting, lucky us. Their partnership, first established when Gardner was music director of English National Opera, must be among opera\u2019s most fruitful.</p> <p>Jan\u00e1\u010dek was 67 when he wrote the opera, confounded by his infatuation with the younger, married <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamila_St%C3%B6sslov%C3%A1\" title=\"\">Kamila St\u00f6sslov\u00e1</a>. She inhabited his music and his fantasies, a willing muse though probably not a lover. (The more I read about her, the less sympathetic I find her.) We should thank her for inspiring works of raw, near-psychotic passion, including the string quartet \u201cIntimate Letters\u201d, as well as <em>K\u00e1t\u2019a</em>, a portrait of suffocated desire and guilt. The American soprano <a href=\"http://www.amandamajeski.com/\" title=\"\">Amanda Majeski</a>, in her Royal Opera House debut, conveyed the character\u2019s nervy confusion in a performance of hypnotic intensity.</p> <p>That Majeski was able to handle Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s unique \u201cspeech melodies\u201d with untroubled ease was a bonus. His way of notating the stresses and intonation of spoken language in often disconnected harmonies, of locking text and music into a single unit, defines his unmistakable sound world. Motifs of just a few notes repeat over and over, battering ear and mind. Melody rises, a half phrase, a line, perhaps with harp adding hopeful sweetness, only to fall away and vanish into a musical abyss. Whereas his earlier masterpiece,<em> Jenufa</em> (1904), is free-flowing in comparison, <em>K\u00e1t\u2019a</em> is concise, spare, scorched by the refiner\u2019s fire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eea5c7428f7d28b8657079558e20850b8af5eadd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eea5c7428f7d28b8657079558e20850b8af5eadd/0_0_4247_2997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pavel \u010cernoch (Boris) with Amanda Majeski in the title role of K\u00e1\u0165a Kabanov\u00e1.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pavel \u010cernoch (Boris) with Amanda Majeski in the title role of K\u00e1\u0165a Kabanov\u00e1.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Women beware women.

The Stade de France was only three-quarters full during the opening match of the championship <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/01/france-wales-six-nations-2019-match-report\" title=\"\">against Wales</a>. It was a Friday night kick-off, which did not help, but the real problem, as Bernard Laporte, the head of the French Federation, said on TV last weekend, is: \u201cWe have a French team which no longer makes us dream.\u201d</p> \n<p>Laporte thinks it has been that way for the past 10 years. Right now, France are ranked 10th in the world, and are closer in points to Spain, who are 21st, than to New Zealand, who are first.</p> \n<p>France\u2019s record was bad enough under their last coach, Guy Nov\u00e8s, who won seven of his 21 matches. It is even worse under his replacement, Jacques Brunel, who took over at the start of last year. Under him France have won only three games out of 12, one against Italy, one against England and one against Argentina.</p> \n<p>Laporte has been forced into defending his old friend Brunel, even though, as he admits himself, there is no good defence to offer. \u201cWe changed the coach just over a year ago because we felt things weren\u2019t going very well, and we can\u2019t say that they\u2019re going much better today,\u201d Laporte said. \u201cBut it would be difficult, and certainly dangerous, to make new changes now.\u201d</p> \n<p>The odd thing is France were leading at half-time in seven of those same games and then went on to lose five of them. That pattern includes three of the last four Tests they have played, against South Africa, Fiji and Wales.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3b36d9a0-5078-47d5-be67-fc2f5236c14d\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It is one of the more surprising sequences in rugby union \u2013 France have not won a Six Nations match at Twickenham for 14 years, and have won only twice there since the game turned professional in 1995:</p>\n    <p><b>March 1997: England 20-23 France</b><br>England led 20-6 after an hour but France staged a remarkable comeback with tries by Laurent Leflamand and Christophe Lamaison. Lamaison was a one-man points machine, scoring 18 from a try, two conversions, two penalties and a drop goal. Abdelatif Benazzi\u2019s side would go on to claim a Five Nations grand slam.</p>\n    <p><b>February 2005: England 17-18 France </b><br>Tries from Olly Barkley and Josh Lewsey gave England a 17-6 half-time lead, but the scrum-half Dimitri Yachvili kicked six penalties while Charlie Hodgson and Barkley missed six between them, as France inflicted the world champions\u2019 eighth defeat in 11 Tests.</p>\n    <p><b>The other matches: England\u2019s glory</b><br>Eleven home wins since 1995, from the resounding \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/mar/21/england-france-six-nations-match-report\">55-35 triumph</a> in March 2015 with England chasing the title on the last day (they came up just short) \u2013 to the narrow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/04/england-france-six-nations-match-report\">19-16 win</a> two years ago, when Ben Te\u2019o\u2019s 71st-minute try made the difference.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>When Wales came back from 16 points down at half-time last week, Warren Gatland said his team had \u201cforgotten how to lose\u201d. Truth is, it is probably more accurate to say that Brunel\u2019s team have forgotten how to win.

      "bodyText": "On Thursday, the French rugby club Carcassonne announced that they were entering into a commercial partnership with the pornographic website Jacquie et Michel, on the grounds that they \u201cshare values of power, endurance, and vigour\u201d. Carcassonne\u2019s general manager, Christine Menardeau-Planchenault, explained that \u201cas a family club\u201d they had put limits on what Jacquie et Michel could get up to. \u201cThere won\u2019t be any naked young women at half-time or any naked rugby,\u201d she explained. Despite that, Menardeau-Planchenault added that while it is normally \u201chard to get people to the stadium\u201d, tickets for their upcoming match against Biarritz were now \u201cflying out of the box office\u201d. If there has been a sudden swelling of enthusiasm for rugby in that little corner of the south, the mood everywhere else in the country is growing pretty listless. The Stade de France was only three-quarters full during the opening match of the championship against Wales. It was a Friday night kick-off, which did not help, but the real problem, as Bernard Laporte, the head of the French Federation, said on TV last weekend, is: \u201cWe have a French team which no longer makes us dream.\u201d Laporte thinks it has been that way for the past 10 years. Right now, France are ranked 10th in the world, and are closer in points to Spain, who are 21st, than to New Zealand, who are first. France\u2019s record was bad enough under their last coach, Guy Nov\u00e8s, who won seven of his 21 matches. It is even worse under his replacement, Jacques Brunel, who took over at the start of last year. Under him France have won only three games out of 12, one against Italy, one against England and one against Argentina. Laporte has been forced into defending his old friend Brunel, even though, as he admits himself, there is no good defence to offer. \u201cWe changed the coach just over a year ago because we felt things weren\u2019t going very well, and we can\u2019t say that they\u2019re going much better today,\u201d Laporte said. \u201cBut it would be difficult, and certainly dangerous, to make new changes now.\u201d The odd thing is France were leading at half-time in seven of those same games and then went on to lose five of them. That pattern includes three of the last four Tests they have played, against South Africa, Fiji and Wales. When Wales came back from 16 points down at half-time last week, Warren Gatland said his team had \u201cforgotten how to lose\u201d. Truth is, it is probably more accurate to say that Brunel\u2019s team have forgotten how to win. Across those 12 Tests under Brunel, France won the first half by an average score of 13-11, and then lost the second by 15-8. They have taken some beatings in the second 40: 18-6 by Scotland, 44-0 by New Zealand, 20-10 by South Africa. Chris Ashton, who spent two years playing for Toulon, suggested this past week that the French players were not used to the intensity of international rugby, because they play such \u201ca slow stop-start game\u201d in the Top 14. \u201cMaybe that step-up shocks them,\u201d the recalled England wing said. \u201cI\u2019d definitely say the Premiership is a lot more intense. The ball is in play a lot more, and the whole game is quicker.\u201d But in France, they are more worried about the mental strength of the players than their physical fitness. And with good reason. \u201cIn the course of the match there is always this fear of winning that resurfaces, these old demons who come back,\u201d said their young scrum-half Baptiste Serin this week. \u201cIt can only be in the head,\u201d says Laporte.

In the run-up to his new series, Islands of America (last week: Hawaii, Alaska, bear cubs), Clunes told the Radio Times that he was not a fan of documentary cliches such as \u201cpretending to meet people for the first time when you\u2019ve already met them the night before.

One of the episodes is a self-referential documentary for the streaming service \u201cHouseflix\u201d, in which a celebrity DJ attempts to uncover the truth about Jon Hamm\u2019s incarcerated kidnapper and rapist, Richard Wayne Gary Wayne. It\u2019s a collection of modern investigative documentary cliches, from the grainy home footage compilation in the opening credits to the scruffy but tenacious lawyer working from his home office. There\u2019s a running gag that the DJ flies to an airport, sets up a camera on the runway, flies home, then flies in again, so that it can record his very plane landing. You can imagine Clunes would approve. This is a bountiful time to be a documentary fan.

      "body": "<p>Brett Kavanaugh went after women\u2019s reproductive rights this week, just months after being placed on the US supreme court. He tried to stop the court from blocking a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/us/politics/louisiana-abortion-law-supreme-court.html\">Louisiana</a> law, which would severely restrict access to abortion in the state. He didn\u2019t quite make it, this time, but only because Chief Justice John Roberts was unwilling to overturn the court\u2019s precedent set just two years earlier in a nearly identical case in Texas. But, still, there was Kavanaugh, who shouldn\u2019t have been on the bench in the first place, weighing in. And, that\u2019s a problem.</p> <p>Without question, the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings were the sub-prime mortgage of US supreme court nominee vetting. The results will likely be equally disastrous.</p> <p>The sub-prime mortgage crisis, which pushed the <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/14477388/Impact-of-Subprime-Crisis-on-World-Economy\">global economy</a> to the edge of the abyss and cost the United States alone <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/14/financial-crisis-cost-gao_n_2687553.html\">$22tn</a>, surprised most Americans because it seemed like all of the safeguards were there to ensure that everything was on the up and up. There were financial regulators, banks, credit reporting agencies, underwriters, property appraisers, procedures for ensuring credit worthiness, the federal agencies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and reams of paper certifying the validity of the loans. But it was all <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/02/movies/02american.html\">a mirage</a>. There was the illusion of a rigorous process but the actual integrity of mortgage lending had dissolved in an agenda driven by greed, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/how-much-did-the-financial-crisis-cost/\">power</a>, and <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2016/04/28/news/companies/bankers-prison/index.html\">corruption</a>.</p> <p>Similarly, the confirmation process for Kavanaugh was rigged from day one. He was nominated by a president who is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/us/politics/cohen-trump-indicted.html\">an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal crime</a> and needed a Supreme Court Justice who had already argued that the nation\u2019s chief executive \u201cshould be <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/top-supreme-court-prospect-has-argued-presidents-should-not-be-distracted-by-investigations-and-lawsuits/2018/06/29/2dd9c1cc-7baa-11e8-80be-6d32e182a3bc_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.9291485f1ee6\">exempt from \u2018time-consuming and distracting\u2019 lawsuits and investigations</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, last fall, the Republicans were anxious that the impending <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/blue-tsunami-4-separate-forecasts-give-house-to-democrats\">\u201cBlue Tsunami\u201d in the mid-term</a> elections just might wipe away Republican majorities in one or both houses of Congress and lead to strengthening voting rights, the Affordable Care Act, and Roe v Wade. To stop that kind of legislation, which is <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/poll-shows-support-obamacare-reaching-all-time-high\">supported</a> by the <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/11/15/how-americans-view-some-of-the-voting-policies-approved-at-the-ballot-box/\">vast</a> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/nbc-wsj-poll-support-roe-v-wade-hits-new-high-n893806\">majority of Americans</a>, would require an impenetrable conservative majority on the Court to act as a bulwark. As a result, for the Republican party leadership, there was no rule that could not be <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/mitch-mcconnell-forget-merrick-garland-gop-can-confirm-a-supreme-court-justice-in-2020-if-it-wants\">invented</a>, ignored, twisted, or lied about to secure that goal.</p> <p>Yet, in its rush to fill the seat, the Republicans, like eager buyers, ignored warning signals that the House of Kavanaugh was not as solid as it originally appeared. Numerous credible allegations of sexual assault were brought against Kavanaugh. And, of course, there was Kavanaugh\u2019s unforgettable <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kEj6lV124U\">rage-filled partisan opening statement</a>.</p> <p>That was more than enough for the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/05/american-bar-association-reevaluate-kavanaughs-high-rating-citing-his-temperament/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.5109f3d9ff2e\">American Bar Association</a> to announce that it would re-evaluate Kavanaugh\u2019s ABA rating. The <a href=\"http://nationalcouncilofchurches.us/ncc-calls-for-withdrawal-of-kavanaugh-nomination/\">National Council of Churches</a> wanted his nomination withdrawn. The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/magazine-of-jesuit-order-withdraws-kavanaugh-endorsement/2018/09/28/62c911c0-c2fa-11e8-9451-e878f96be19b_story.html?utm_term=.fddbd2b73266\">Jesuits</a> backed away from him. Faculty and students from <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/09/protests-grow-yale-law-school-over-brett-kavanaugh/571225/\">his alma mater</a> urged the senate to vote \u201cno.\u201d More than <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/03/opinion/kavanaugh-law-professors-letter.html\">2,000 law professors</a> came out against Kavanaugh\u2019s elevation to the highest court in the land. Even former <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/us/politics/john-paul-stevens-brett-kavanaugh.html\">Justice John Paul Stevens</a> declared that after that partisan rant, it was clear that Kavanaugh was unfit and didn\u2019t have the required judicial temperament to sit on the Supreme Court.</p> <p>Despite all of the warning signs, however, Kavanaugh was still confirmed by the slimmest of margins with Senator Susan Collins, a key swing vote, convinced that he was committed to precedent and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/10/susan-collins-brett-kavanaugh-roe-v-wade/572344/\">would not vote to overturn Roe v Wade.</a>\u201d</p> <p>As this spectacle unfolded, it became clear, just like the subprime mortgage fiasco, that our institutions have once again failed the American people. Accountability collapsed under the weight of a party <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2012/08/29/b9023a52-f1ec-11e1-892d-bc92fee603a7_story.html?utm_term=.2a2f33a22748\">unnecessarily fearful of demographic change</a>. And, equally important, that fear has put the nation at risk.</p> <p>Someone is now ensconced on the highest court in the land who was not properly vetted. The Republicans glossed over questions about judicial temperament and partisanship, alcohol abuse, sexual violence, <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/09/08/brett-kavanaughs-perjury-avalanche-50-years-in-the-making/\">perjury</a>, and how <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/07/new-strike-against-kavanaugh-season-tickets/565022/\">hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt</a> accrued and disappeared within a year. It was as if they were looking at an applicant with an 810-credit score, 50% down, and a debt-to-credit ratio that was well within bounds. But once the veneer of girls\u2019 basketball coach, Yale Law, and carpool dad was pulled away, Kavanaugh exuded the telltale signs of a major credit risk on the bench.</p> <p>We don\u2019t know to whom he actually owed $200,000 and what the source of funds were to pay it off so quickly. We don\u2019t know how a judge can <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/09/the-many-mysteries-of-brett-kavanaughs-finances/\">afford a country club fee</a> that\u2019s nearly half his salary. In short, we don\u2019t know who owns him. Because his work with the George W Bush administration during the War on Terror is still locked away in the <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/politics/news/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-confirmation-1202925705/\">93%</a> of documentation that was hidden from the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, we don\u2019t know if a case involving torture, Guantanamo Bay, or NSA wiretapping would be a conflict of interest because he was somehow involved. We simply don\u2019t know.</p> <p>What we do know is that his hyper-partisan rant makes Kavanaugh a compromised member on the Supreme Court who would have to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/opinion/justice-kavanaugh-recuse-himself.html\">recuse himself</a> from a number of cases brought by the very \u201cleft-wing opposition groups\u201d he accused of trying to derail him, such as the ACLU, NAACP-Legal Defense Fund, and Planned Parenthood. If Kavanaugh refused to bow out of those cases, especially given his threat that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/us/politics/read-brett-kavanaughs-complete-opening-statement.html?module=inline\">\u201cwhat goes around comes around</a>,\u201d the Court\u2019s decision would naturally be seen as a vendetta, payback, and, therefore, suspect.</p> <p>Yet, credibility and trust are absolutely essential for a functioning democracy; essential for governance; and essential for the rule of law. Once the court\u2019s rulings are called into question on basic fundamental grounds of judicial bias, its legitimacy becomes as shaky and threatening to the political system as Wall Street\u2019s alchemy of converting suspect \u201cC\u201d mortgage bonds into \u201cA\u201d rated ones was to the economy.</p> <p>That didn\u2019t end so well, either.</p> <ul> <li><p>Carol Anderson is the Charles Howard Candler Professor of African American Studies at Emory University and the author of White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide and One Person, No Vote: How Voter Suppression is Destroying Our Democracy.

      "bodyText": "Brett Kavanaugh went after women\u2019s reproductive rights this week, just months after being placed on the US supreme court. He tried to stop the court from blocking a Louisiana law, which would severely restrict access to abortion in the state. He didn\u2019t quite make it, this time, but only because Chief Justice John Roberts was unwilling to overturn the court\u2019s precedent set just two years earlier in a nearly identical case in Texas. But, still, there was Kavanaugh, who shouldn\u2019t have been on the bench in the first place, weighing in. And, that\u2019s a problem. Without question, the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings were the sub-prime mortgage of US supreme court nominee vetting. The results will likely be equally disastrous. The sub-prime mortgage crisis, which pushed the global economy to the edge of the abyss and cost the United States alone $22tn, surprised most Americans because it seemed like all of the safeguards were there to ensure that everything was on the up and up. There were financial regulators, banks, credit reporting agencies, underwriters, property appraisers, procedures for ensuring credit worthiness, the federal agencies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and reams of paper certifying the validity of the loans. But it was all a mirage. There was the illusion of a rigorous process but the actual integrity of mortgage lending had dissolved in an agenda driven by greed, power, and corruption. Similarly, the confirmation process for Kavanaugh was rigged from day one. He was nominated by a president who is an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal crime and needed a Supreme Court Justice who had already argued that the nation\u2019s chief executive \u201cshould be exempt from \u2018time-consuming and distracting\u2019 lawsuits and investigations.\u201d Meanwhile, last fall, the Republicans were anxious that the impending \u201cBlue Tsunami\u201d in the mid-term elections just might wipe away Republican majorities in one or both houses of Congress and lead to strengthening voting rights, the Affordable Care Act, and Roe v Wade. To stop that kind of legislation, which is supported by the vast majority of Americans, would require an impenetrable conservative majority on the Court to act as a bulwark. As a result, for the Republican party leadership, there was no rule that could not be invented, ignored, twisted, or lied about to secure that goal. Yet, in its rush to fill the seat, the Republicans, like eager buyers, ignored warning signals that the House of Kavanaugh was not as solid as it originally appeared. Numerous credible allegations of sexual assault were brought against Kavanaugh. And, of course, there was Kavanaugh\u2019s unforgettable rage-filled partisan opening statement. That was more than enough for the American Bar Association to announce that it would re-evaluate Kavanaugh\u2019s ABA rating. The National Council of Churches wanted his nomination withdrawn. The Jesuits backed away from him. Faculty and students from his alma mater urged the senate to vote \u201cno.\u201d More than 2,000 law professors came out against Kavanaugh\u2019s elevation to the highest court in the land. Even former Justice John Paul Stevens declared that after that partisan rant, it was clear that Kavanaugh was unfit and didn\u2019t have the required judicial temperament to sit on the Supreme Court. Despite all of the warning signs, however, Kavanaugh was still confirmed by the slimmest of margins with Senator Susan Collins, a key swing vote, convinced that he was committed to precedent and \u201cwould not vote to overturn Roe v Wade.\u201d As this spectacle unfolded, it became clear, just like the subprime mortgage fiasco, that our institutions have once again failed the American people. Accountability collapsed under the weight of a party unnecessarily fearful of demographic change. And, equally important, that fear has put the nation at risk. Someone is now ensconced on the highest court in the land who was not properly vetted. The Republicans glossed over questions about judicial temperament and partisanship, alcohol abuse, sexual violence, perjury, and how hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt accrued and disappeared within a year. It was as if they were looking at an applicant with an 810-credit score, 50% down, and a debt-to-credit ratio that was well within bounds. But once the veneer of girls\u2019 basketball coach, Yale Law, and carpool dad was pulled away, Kavanaugh exuded the telltale signs of a major credit risk on the bench. We don\u2019t know to whom he actually owed $200,000 and what the source of funds were to pay it off so quickly. We don\u2019t know how a judge can afford a country club fee that\u2019s nearly half his salary. In short, we don\u2019t know who owns him. Because his work with the George W Bush administration during the War on Terror is still locked away in the 93% of documentation that was hidden from the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, we don\u2019t know if a case involving torture, Guantanamo Bay, or NSA wiretapping would be a conflict of interest because he was somehow involved. We simply don\u2019t know. What we do know is that his hyper-partisan rant makes Kavanaugh a compromised member on the Supreme Court who would have to recuse himself from a number of cases brought by the very \u201cleft-wing opposition groups\u201d he accused of trying to derail him, such as the ACLU, NAACP-Legal Defense Fund, and Planned Parenthood. If Kavanaugh refused to bow out of those cases, especially given his threat that \u201cwhat goes around comes around,\u201d the Court\u2019s decision would naturally be seen as a vendetta, payback, and, therefore, suspect. Yet, credibility and trust are absolutely essential for a functioning democracy; essential for governance; and essential for the rule of law. Once the court\u2019s rulings are called into question on basic fundamental grounds of judicial bias, its legitimacy becomes as shaky and threatening to the political system as Wall Street\u2019s alchemy of converting suspect \u201cC\u201d mortgage bonds into \u201cA\u201d rated ones was to the economy. That didn\u2019t end so well, either.

It\u2019s fair to say they\u2019re on a roll; relegation haunted Fulham, who have lost four of their last five Premier League matches, have it all to do this lunchtime.</p> <p><strong>As if current form doesn\u2019t paint a bad enough picture for the Cottagers, the head-to-head record is an appalling sight as well. </strong>They\u2019ve lost eight of their last nine matches against United to an aggregate score of 25-7. In the Premier League era, they\u2019ve lost 19 times to the Red Devils, winning just the three. They\u2019ve already been whacked 4-1 by them this season, and that was when the shackles were very much still on, during the miserablist reign of Jose Mourinho.</p> <p><strong>None of this bodes well for Fulham. </strong>But then nobody expected Burnley to get so much as a point at Old Trafford a couple of weeks ago, and look what happened there. Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side may be 19th in the table, seven points adrift of safety, but their recent home form offers a little hope: they\u2019ve won two of their last three in the Premier League, and the other match was a tussle with another in-form top-six team, Tottenham, lost only in the final minute.</p> <p><strong>But United will be strong favourites to continue their assault on the Champions League places. </strong>Another Ole-inspired win here will take them ahead of Chelsea and into the top four, at least for a day. Who\u2019d have thought that was achievable a couple of months ago?! Any sort of result for Fulham would feel even more precious, given their predicament. Here\u2019s to a tantalising tussle on the Thames. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong><em>Kick off: </em></strong><em>12.30pm GMT.</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-09T11:16:32.594Z\">at 11.16am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s your lot. Jacob Steinberg was our man at Craven Cottage; here\u2019s his take on a fine performance from United, and a worrying one for Fulham. Thanks for reading! And now a much happier Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. \u201cIf you don\u2019t risk, you don\u2019t win, and it\u2019s a squad game. You have to trust the players and I didn\u2019t have any worries. Yes, the first ten minutes we were put under pressure, but after the first goal we were different class. I was happiest with the second half, we took the tempo down and controlled the ball, which is different to what we did against Leicester, and that\u2019s another step in the right direction.\u201d He\u2019s then asked about playing Ander Herrera deeper so Paul Pogba can go further forward, and jokes that the players are \u201cfinally doing what they are told\u201d. Oh Jose! A downcast Claudio Ranieri speaks. \u201cI was so happy the first ten minutes, we created two good chances to score goals. But after we conceded, we had to stay calm, and we lost our composure. Our fault was big, but against Manchester United we needed to do something better. We have got to work hard, it\u2019s important to do our best. I watched my team down 3-0, but they still wanted to score a goal, so that is a good thing. We fight.\u201d Man-of-the-match Paul Pogba speaks! \u201cIt feels great. That\u2019s what we wanted, since Ole came: the top four. We\u2019re there and we want to stay there. We have big games coming up, so it won\u2019t be easy. But we put in a good performance as a team. When we need three points, we get the three points. But these big games coming up will determine where we end up. I feel great, the team feels good.\u201d Both teams have some big tests coming up. It doesn\u2019t get any easier for Fulham at Craven Cottage: their next three guests will be Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City! United meanwhile prepare for a tricky triptych of their own: a Champions League tie against PSG, an FA Cup match at Chelsea, and the visit of Liverpool in the league. They do so from a good place: they\u2019ll stay in fourth unless Chelsea get a point at City tomorrow afternoon. Nothing much happens in added time, and there\u2019s the final whistle. An easy victory for United, Ole Gunnar Solksjaer\u2019s tenth in 11 attempts. Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial were quite magnificent. They go into fourth spot, ahead of Chelsea; that looked a pipe dream just a few weeks ago! PSG will hold few fears when they\u2019re in this mood. Fulham by contrast started bright but petered out quickly. They remain in 19th spot, seven points away from safety. They\u2019re booed off by a section of the home support. 90 min: There will be three added minutes. 89 min: Finally Fulham show a little fight ... albeit literally. Mitrovic and de Gea go nose to nose, the keeper running the clock down with the ball at his feet, then getting barged after he finally picked it up. It all calms down quickly enough, and they\u2019re both booked. 88 min: Mitrovic slips Sessegon into space down the left, but the flag goes up for offside. 87 min: Cairney has a whack from 25 yards. It\u2019s always going wide right. 85 min: Before it can be taken, Herrera is replaced by Bailly. Mata\u2019s corner doesn\u2019t beat first man Ream, but it\u2019s only half cleared, allowing McTominay to fizz a low, diagonal pass from the right wing towards the far post. Smalling slides in, but can\u2019t connect. Close to a fourth, and that wouldn\u2019t flatter United. 84 min: See 84 min. Then Mata turns it up a little down the right, his low cross intended for Lukaku. But a corner will do. 82 min: United stroke it around, feet up, pipe on. 80 min: Sessegnon comes on for Bryan. 79 min: Craven Cottage is pretty quiet right now, the travelling support apart. Their team started well, but have shown little spirit since falling behind. The rain comes down, matching a mood. 77 min: Babel is hooked in humiliating circumstances, seconds after an astonishing miss. There\u2019s some pinball in the United box, and the ball ends up at Babel\u2019s feet, a yard out, just by the left-hand post. He knocks his shot against the woodwork, the rebound clanking off his shin and out of play for a goal kick. Off he goes, immediately, to ironic cheers. Cairney comes on to replace him. 75 min: Fulham struggle to clear the corner. Sergio Rico flaps. Babel loses possession. That allows Sanchez, out on the left, to send a high cross into the box. McTominay flashes a header inches over the bar. That would have been quite the instant impact. 74 min: McTominay comes on in place of Pogba. Then a dismal clearing header by Le Marchand clanks into Sanchez, who races clear. He should score, but allows Sergio Rico to turn the ball round the right-hand post for a corner. 73 min: A lull. And then suddenly Fulham come to life, pinging it around prettily. Babel feeds Christie down the right. The resulting cross finds the head of Mitrovic, who aims for the top right. It\u2019s on target, but there\u2019s no real pace to the header, and de Gea plucks it from the sky easily enough. 70 min: This match couldn\u2019t have gone much better for United. Long over, it\u2019s being played at testimonial pace now, Fulham offering very little resistance. Time to give Martial a rest ahead of the PSG match. Sanchez comes on in his place. 69 min: Chambers sends a pea-roller towards the bottom left. De Gea gathers with a yawn. 68 min: Christie bothers Shaw enough to win a corner on the right. Seri hits it long to nobody in particular. 67 min: Babel valiantly tries to get something going for Fulham, dribbling down the right. But he\u2019s got no options nearby, and is soon forced to turn tail. Pogba doesn\u2019t stutter much, by his own elaborate standards anyway. And then he sidefoots powerfully into the bottom right. Sergio Rico guessed correctly, but still had no chance. It\u2019s not as though this third goal wasn\u2019t coming. 64 min: Lukaku bursts down the right. He could shoot himself, reward for a powerful run, but slips inside for Mata. The pass is behind Mata, and the danger looks over, but Le Marchand clumsily clips him from behind. It\u2019s a no-brainer, in more ways than one. 63 min: Herrera belts a shot towards the top left from 25 yards. Sergio Rico parries well. This is a lop-sided affair now, attack versus defence. 62 min: Lukaku brings down a long ball, spins, and tries to thread a pass down the middle to release Martial. Not quite. 61 min: United are in complete control of this match. Martial probes again down the left; Sergio Rico punches his cross clear of danger. But the visitors keep on coming back. Another phase of passing, and Pogba tries a low drive from the edge of the D. It\u2019s blocked, but there\u2019s a sense that a third goal is only a matter of time. The away fans are giving it plenty; the home fans, not so much. 60 min: Pogba is clipped over by Seri, out on the right. Mata takes a quick free kick but only manages to scoop it into the arms of Sergio Rico. 58 min: A corner for Fulham out on the left. Seri\u2019s delivery is not great, and United are able to streak upfield in numbers. But for once they\u2019re a little laboured in the final third, and Fulham, light at the back, escape. 56 min: A dreadful clearance by Odoi is returned by Pogba, who slips Martial free into the Fulham area down the inside left. Fortunately for the hosts, Martial is flagged offside, correctly so. It\u2019s double fortune, given Le Marchand came sliding in on Martial, clattering him to the ground. That would have been a decision for the ref to make, had the flag not gone up. 55 min: Christie is quickly into the thick of it, making good ground down the right. But his cross leads to nothing. No matter, he comes again, battling hard to break through a couple of tackles and laying off to Babel. But Babel takes a heavy touch that allows Pogba to shepherd the ball out of play for a goal kick. 53 min: The home fans belt out a chorus of \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing\u201d as Ranieri sends on Christie ... but hooks Schurrle, one of Fulham\u2019s better players this afternoon. 52 min: Mitrovic tees up Chambers, 25 yards from goal. Chambers shoots, but falls backwards while doing it. The ball sails harmlessly over the bar. 51 min: Pogba and Mata make a nuisance of themselves down the inside-left channel. Martial takes up possession and nearly dribbles his way into space, but there\u2019s no room in the area and the ball breaks through to Sergio Rico. 50 min: United assumed a quiet control of this match. They\u2019re quite happy to let Fulham ping it around the middle of the park, because the hosts are going nowhere. United conserving energy and happy to play on the break. 48 min: A little bit of space for Schurrle out on the right. He clips a long diagonal ball towards the near post. There\u2019s nobody there. De Gea calmly watches it sail behind for a goal kick. 46 min: United are immediately up in Fulham\u2019s grille. Pogba chips down the right to tee up Martial, but instead of shooting from a tight angle lays off to Mata ... who shoots from a tight angle. That\u2019s blocked. Then Herrera has a couple of weak attempts from 20 yards. Fulham are a right old state at the back, like that\u2019s a piece of breaking news. United get the second half underway. No half-time changes. Now, Fulham were two goals adrift at half-time in their last game at Craven Cottage, too, but came back to win 4-2. It was some story when they did that to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion; it\u2019ll be a tale for the ages if they replicate the feat today. Half-time entertainment. There\u2019s time for one more Martial run down the left, but for once Odoi sticks with him and the ball ends up trundling into the arms of Sergio Rico. Then de Gea flaps at a Schurrle cross from the right, and there\u2019s calls for a penalty as Jones clears, but it hit the big lad\u2019s chest. And that\u2019s the end of an entertaining first half. Fulham have been lively, but United\u2019s quality at the sharp end has been the difference. Anthony Martial has been sensational. 45 min: Odoi curls one in from the right. Mitrovic tries to spin Smalling, but the United defender isn\u2019t having it, outmuscling the striker before clearing. 44 min: From the resulting free kick, the ball drops to Chambers to the right of the D. He attempts to Le Tissier an insouciant volley into the bottom right, but his dipping shot is well snaffled by the safe hands of de Gea. 43 min: But now he\u2019s in the book for barging into the same player\u2019s back. He can have no complaints, and to be fair doesn\u2019t bother making any. 42 min: Matic sticks his arm across Babel, who was trying to zip down the left, and is fortunate to escape censure. 40 min: Martial causes all manner of bother down the left again. He\u2019s got Odoi on toast. He looks for the top right, but the ball deflects out for United\u2019s first corner of the match. The ball\u2019s hit long. Martial reaches the byline on the left, and pulls back for Lukaku, who cocks his leg to shoot but fresh-airs it. The ball breaks to Jones on the edge of the area; the big defender creams a glorious shot inches over the bar, tipped away by the fingertips of Sergio Rico. Nowt happens from the second corner. 38 min: Chambers is booked for standing on Smalling\u2019s extended leg in a 50-50 on the edge of the United area. It\u2019s clumsy at best; players have seen red for less. Thankfully Smalling is quickly up and about again. 36 min: Herrera slips as he goes into a 50-50 challenge with Ream, and comes off second best. He\u2019ll be OK to continue, and he\u2019s rather fortunately won a free kick out of sympathy. Nothing comes of it, even though United load the box, which is probably the best thing for karmic balance. 35 min: Chambers creams a long ball down the middle, but there\u2019s only Schurrle there. Smalling and Jones are always shepherding that one back through to de Gea. 33 min: Well, we say nothing comes of it ... but United nearly score a third. United scamper up the other end on the counter. Herrera slips a pass into the Fulham box from the right, Pogba having broken clear down that channel. Pogba briefly thinks about a first-time lash from a tight angle on the right this time, but hesitates slightly and is eventually crowded out. 32 min: Bryan hooks it into the mixer. United half clear, and Seri returns it, with a view to scoring in the top-right corner. A deflection sees the ball go out for a corner on the right, from which nothing comes. 31 min: Herrera gets a bit too close to Mitrovic, the pair tussling 35 yards from the United goal, and that\u2019s a free kick to Fulham, just to the left of centre. A chance to load the box. 30 min: Vietto battles well to bring down a long pass on the left-hand corner of the United box. But a ball rolled across the face of the area evades Mitrovic, and the crowd allow themselves a wee groan in frustration. 28 min: Schurrle and Babel are still probing away, both busy as ever. Nothing\u2019s quite working for them, though. Babel drops deep, and tries to slip Vietto free down the inside-left channel. There\u2019s a huge gap in the United defence, but the pass is way too strong, and the opportunity is wasted. 25 min: Why on earth was Jose Mourinho trying to bundle Martial out of the door? It\u2019s staggering. In the meantime, Fulham are struggling to clear their heads after that quick United double. Bryan goes sliding in late on Smalling, and he becomes the first booking of the afternoon. This is a truly sensational goal! Martial picks up possession on the halfway line, and bursts down the right. He\u2019s got the legs on Odoi, who is burned off quickly enough. Then he drifts inside, briefly shows the ball to Le Marchand, and then breezes off down the channel with it, another defender left behind. He\u2019s clear in the area. He opens his body and sends a low curler into the bottom right. Sergio Rico had no chance whatsoever with that one! 22 min: Matic drives down the middle, and it nearly opens up for him. Just as he thinks about a shot from distance, Seri smothers him. Just in time. 20 min: De Gea is fine to continue. Meanwhile Fulham have responded well to falling behind, in terms of territory at least, though United are holding firm on the edge of their own box. No way through. Odoi tries to burst clear down the right, but Martial comes back to lend his defenders a hand, and eases the Fulham right-back away from the danger zone. 18 min: That was Pogba\u2019s seventh goal in his last eight Premier League outings, by the way. It was some effort, though whenever a keeper\u2019s beaten from a tight angle at his near post, there\u2019ll be questions. It wasn\u2019t top-drawer netminding, granted, but the ferocity of Pogba\u2019s shot, added to the element of surprise, surely limits any criticism. It was a hell of a strike. Accentuate the positive. 16 min: So much for Fulham\u2019s fast start! Mitrovic chases after a long ball but only manages to clatter into de Gea. The United keeper\u2019s down, receiving treatment. After a rocky start, United begin to assert control. Martial has another run at Odoi, but can\u2019t find anyone in the middle. And then: bang! Another phase of attack, and Pogba is slipped in down the left. He\u2019s faced with a tight angle, but lashes an outstanding first-time shot past Sergio Rico, beating the keeper at his near post! That was a real whipcracker! 13 min: Matic is down, having taken a couple of his former Chelsea team-mate Schurrle\u2019s studs on his knee. For a second, he looks in some distress, but the big man gets up again quickly enough, albeit gingerly. 11 min: United are looking for Martial down the left every time. The winger appears to have the beating of Odoi, but he\u2019s not received a particularly inviting pass yet. 9 min: Fulham will be extremely happy with this start. Nearly half of the match so far has been played in United\u2019s final third. 7 min: Herrera sends a witless ball forward to nobody, full of panic amid the Fulham press. But Le Marchand, wandering upfield having taken up easy possession, runs into Lukaku. Suddenly Martial and Pogba are tearing down the inside-left channel. Pogba enters the box, tussles with the recovering Le Marchand, and the pair fall limply to the ground. A half-arsed shout for a penalty, but it was 50-50 and United are never getting that. 5 min: Now Schurrle sends a speculative effort over the crossbar! Setting aside the small matter of actually getting an attempt on target, Fulham have looked extremely dangerous in these opening exchanges. 4 min: And once again Fulham cause United a whole world of problems. Babel dribbles down the left and feeds Bryan on the overlap. Bryan finds Mitrovic at the far post, but the big striker can only head across the face of goal from close range. Shaw prods a clearance straight to Schurrle, who leans back and blazes over from the penalty spot. 3 min: More good work by Schurrle, who nearly breaks clear down the right. But Shaw does enough to block, and it\u2019s a goal kick. 1 min: What a start to this game! First up, Dalot was fouled down the United right. From the free kick, Pogba fluffed a header from eight yards. Fulham broke upfield through Schurrle down the right. With United having committed everyone up for the free kick, they\u2019re light at the back. Schurrle wedges across to Vietto, on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. He\u2019s free, but scuffs his first-time shot wide, his body shape all wrong. What a chance that was for an early shock! And we\u2019re off! Fulham get the ball rolling. Incidentally, before kick-off, there was a moment\u2019s applause in loving memory of Emiliano Sala. The teams are out! A marvellous atmosphere at one of the prettiest grounds in the country. Fulham are in their storied white-and-black garb, while United wear ... we\u2019ve already covered this. \u201cAgree that the gear looks good on the tiling,\u201d begins John O\u2019Donovan. \u201cDo you reckon they wear brand new stuff every time? Or is there a chance to wear things in? If I get a new t-shirt I\u2019m not comfortable till I\u2019ve cut the tags off and worn it in a few times. Must be weird being box-fresh all the time.\u201d I guess as professional sports stars they\u2019ve long become used to their entire lives being box-fresh. A bit like that old Billy Connolly line about the Queen assuming the whole world smells of fresh paint, because there\u2019s always someone ten feet ahead of her frantically tarting the place up for her arrival. Claudio talks to Sky! \u201cThey can change eight, 11 changes, anything on the pitch. They have a lot of champions. But we are ready for the battle, to try to show our football. I hope we can make our fans happy at the end of the match. Schurrle gives us experience and intelligence. We have to move the ball quickly, and forward. We have to be compact and press. We have to be calm, very fast and quick!\u201d A quick peek behind the scenes. And you have to say that United\u2019s gear pairs well with the tiling at Craven Cottage. A slight shame about those bottles of squash, sitting there all orange, yellow and purple. An isotonic blight on an otherwise very satisfying composition. Ole speaks to his old team-mate Gary Neville on Sky. \u201cA couple of changes had to be made. Marcus Rashford has had a dead leg against Leicester, Victor Lindelof is a slight concern but hopefully he\u2019ll be OK for Tuesday. Chris Smalling and Phil Jones did really well against Aleksandar Mitrovic last time, and we felt this is going to be a fight in the box with him so we put them in there. When we came in, we were way behind top four. So if you get the chance to take the three points and jump in, see what happens with City and Chelsea tomorrow, it\u2019s an important game for us today. We have to stand up and be resilient, it will be tough today. There is no complacency. There is no secret to playing football: you have to enjoy yourself, and you need good players that are able to express themselves. Work hard, stay together. It\u2019s simple.\u201d It\u2019s a simple set-up for the self-aware Neville, who cracks wise that \u201cit wasn\u2019t simple for me at Valencia when I tried that!\u201d Hearty laughs and slaps on the back, and the old pals are off their separate ways. Both teams have had a nice week off to relax and recuperate. Fulham come off the back of a 2-0 loss at Crystal Palace, and make two changes to the team named for that one. Luciano Vietto and Andre Schurrle take the places of Tom Cairney and Cyrus Christie, both of whom drop to the bench. Manchester United make six changes to the team selected for the 1-0 victory at Leicester City, with PSG on Tuesday night no doubt in mind. Diogo Dalot, Chris Smalling, Phil Jones, Juan Mata, Romelu Lukaku and Anthony Martial are in; Ashley Young, Victor Lindelof, Eric Bailly, Jesse Lingard, Alexis Sanchez and Marcus Rashford step down. Fulham: Sergio Rico, Odoi, Le Marchand, Ream, Bryan, Chambers, Seri, Babel, Schurrle, Vietto, Mitrovic. Subs: Ryan Sessegnon, Kebano, Cairney, Ayite, Christie, Zambo, Ramirez. Manchester United: de Gea, Dalot, Smalling, Jones, Shaw, Herrera, Matic, Pogba, Mata, Lukaku, Martial. Subs: Bailly, Sanchez, Rashford, Lingard, Young, Romero, McTominay. Referee: Paul Tierney (Lancashire). This is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s 11th match as interim manager of Manchester United Football Club. So far during his astonishing reign, United have won nine games, and staged a late two-goal comeback in the other fixture played. It\u2019s fair to say they\u2019re on a roll; relegation haunted Fulham, who have lost four of their last five Premier League matches, have it all to do this lunchtime. As if current form doesn\u2019t paint a bad enough picture for the Cottagers, the head-to-head record is an appalling sight as well. They\u2019ve lost eight of their last nine matches against United to an aggregate score of 25-7. In the Premier League era, they\u2019ve lost 19 times to the Red Devils, winning just the three. They\u2019ve already been whacked 4-1 by them this season, and that was when the shackles were very much still on, during the miserablist reign of Jose Mourinho. None of this bodes well for Fulham. But then nobody expected Burnley to get so much as a point at Old Trafford a couple of weeks ago, and look what happened there. Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side may be 19th in the table, seven points adrift of safety, but their recent home form offers a little hope: they\u2019ve won two of their last three in the Premier League, and the other match was a tussle with another in-form top-six team, Tottenham, lost only in the final minute. But United will be strong favourites to continue their assault on the Champions League places. Another Ole-inspired win here will take them ahead of Chelsea and into the top four, at least for a day. Who\u2019d have thought that was achievable a couple of months ago?! Any sort of result for Fulham would feel even more precious, given their predicament. Here\u2019s to a tantalising tussle on the Thames. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.30pm GMT.",

His role, he says, is to recruit migrants as part of a smuggling network operating along the north Egyptian coast. \u201cPeople come to me to organise their transport and to make the payment,\u201d he says. \u201cI confirm the payment with the boss, and then I bring people from Cairo to Alexandria. They stay in warehouses on chicken farms and wait there until the time is ready to go to sea.\u201d In response to a government crackdown, smugglers operating out of Egypt and Libya have raised fees from $1,500 to $3,500 (\u00a31,160 to \u00a32,710) to maintain profits. Unable to finance travel, people smugglers are referring migrants to organ brokers in Cairo to raise the necessary capital. \u201cPeople can pay less than the asking price [of $3,500] but if you do this, you\u2019re like a third-class passenger,\u201d he advises. \u201cThese ones can end up in detention centres where they will only be released if they agree to work or sell their bodies for sex.\u201d Ibrahim shifts in his seat uncomfortably, reaching for a cigarette. He inhales slowly, taking his time to consider what he wants to say next. \u201cThere are some people who only care about getting the money. They don\u2019t care if you arrive at your destination or end up dying at sea. This is why I advise people to make the payment in advance, even if that means selling a kidney.\u201d Ibrahim draws my attention to bullet holes over the door frame, a relic of the revolution when shots were fired at protesters during demonstrations on 25 January 2011. He knows that what he is doing is illegal but suggests the government is at fault. \u201cI do not see my work as bad because I am helping people change their life for the better.\u201d A law banning organ sales was introduced in 2010 but has pushed the trade further underground. Asha, from Sudan, explains how she was recruited in Khartoum and taken to Cairo. \u201cThey said they would find me work and then they would take me to Italy. I did not trust these men, but it was impossible for me to stay in Khartoum. My children were sick from not eating. So, I listened to them.\u201d When she arrived in Cairo, Asha was told that she would not be going to Europe. Instead she would be \u201cdonating\u201d her kidney. She was promised $2,000 if she complied. If not, the men said, they would take her kidney by force. Asha was taken by taxi to a nondescript apartment in Alexandria. \u201cI know it was Alexandria because I could see the ocean from the taxi. Then I was in a room with medical equipment, but this is all I can tell you. They locked me in the room and told me to think of my children.\u201d After surgery, Asha reported one of the brokers to the police. He was arrested and held for 30 days, then released without charge. In July 2018, a statement from the Egyptian Health Ministry announced that 37 people had been found guilty by an Egyptian court on charges related to illicit trading in human organs. There was no mention of the victims. A spokesman from the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: \u201cEgyptian authorities continue to vigilantly pursue, investigate and bring to justice any such crimes of organ trade in accordance with the stringent provisions of the criminal law. Furthermore, this hideous illegal trade has never been condoned by the Egyptian government and law enforcement authorities. We will continue to combat such crimes and bring those engaged in the organ trade to justice, while protecting Egyptian citizens as well as our host refugee and migrant community.\u201d Asha lives in fear for her life, subjected to threats and intimidation by the broker and his associates. She says she was told that if she did not withdraw her statement, her children would bear the consequences. \u201cI am worried about what will happen to my children. I am worried they will come for their organs too.\u201d Names have been changed. Dr Sean Columb is a lecturer in law at the University of Liverpool. He is writing a book on the organ trade, to be published by Stanford University Press in 2020",

      "bodyText": "Born in London in 1969 to Paul and Linda McCartney, Mary McCartney followed in her mother\u2019s footsteps and became a professional photographer in 1992. She has published three vegetarian cookbooks and a number of photography books, including From Where I Stand (2010) and Monochrome &amp; Colour (2014). McCartney\u2019s latest book, Paris Nude (Heni), a record of two days spent at the home of New York-born, Paris-based comedian Phyllis Wang, is out now. 1. Documentary Matangi/Maya/MIA I\u2019ve always loved MIA\u2019s music, but didn\u2019t know much about her background. The documentary shows her life, her art and political leanings \u2013 it has footage from when she was at college up until now. I didn\u2019t know she\u2019d started out as an artist and film-maker. It\u2019s particularly poignant when she goes back to Sri Lanka and is playing with the kids in her grandmother\u2019s house; it showed her human side rather than just her up on stage. I thought it was very intelligently put together. 2. Podcast Front Row I like to put this on if I\u2019m on the tube, travelling or walking in the park \u2013 I\u2019ll catch up on things.

      "body": "<p>Sex offenders will be given support to help find a job and make new friends under a pioneering scheme run by a university and backed by police. The initiative aims to integrate people back into society to prevent them committing further crimes.</p> <p>Offenders will visit a centre, the first of its kind in the UK, where they will receive employment training \u2013 from management skills to writing CVs \u2013 as well as help with building a supportive social circle, finding new hobbies or learning basic skills such as cooking.</p> <p>The strategy\u2019s advocates say that, while they realise it will be controversial, it will reduce reoffending rates. The aim is to work with up to 100 people in the first year.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to make sure they won\u2019t reoffend because they will have found a niche in society, a way of reintegrating,\u201d said Professor Belinda Winder, head of the sexual offences, crime and misconduct research unit at Nottingham Trent University, which is piloting the scheme.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s for people who are going to be rejected, who feel desperate, lonely, isolated, a vicious circle which can contribute to reoffending. We are going to break that vicious cycle, but it\u2019s difficult to know if people are going to be able to stomach this.\u201d</p> <p>Although programmes already exist to help support convicted sex offenders, the Nottingham scheme, adopted by the Corbett Centre for Prisoner Reintegration, is said to be the world\u2019s first holistic approach to fully integrating sex offenders back into society.</p> <p>Last year the main sex offender treatment programme for England and Wales was scrapped by the Ministry of Justice after a report revealed it led to more reoffending.</p> <p>Researchers found that prisoners completing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/30/sex-offenders-on-group-treatment-programme-more-likely-to-reoffend\" title=\"\">programme</a> \u2013 which was designed to challenge the behaviour of male sex offenders with psychological techniques to change their thinking \u2013 were more likely to commit further crimes. Reoffending rates for sex offenders are <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13701423_Predicting_relapse_A_meta-analysis_of_sexual_offender_recidivism_studies_Journal_of_Consulting_and_Clinical_Psychology_66_348-362\" title=\"\">between 10 to 14%</a>.</p> <p>The centre itself will have police from the Nottinghamshire\u2019s force on site at various times during the week so they can meet sex offenders <a href=\"https://www.nacro.org.uk/resettlement-advice-service/support-for-individuals/advice-prisoners-people-licence-sex-offenders-mappa/advice-people-convicted-sex-offences/\" title=\"\">on licence</a>, a move that will help save time and resources tracking down their whereabouts.</p> <p>Nottinghamshire\u2019s police and crime commissioner Paddy Tipping said: \u201cThis groundbreaking piece of work will hopefully set the new standard for post-sentence reintegration into the community. It\u2019s absolutely logical.</p> <p>\u201cIf we can rehabilitate offenders and support them as they return to live in the community, they will be safer and less likely to reoffend. This in turn means there will be fewer victims of sexual abuse and harm. It\u2019s an ambitious project and I\u2019m proud to be involved.\u201d</p> <p>The centre will be housed at a university-owned building in the middle of the city.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re mindful of the difficulties of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Winder. \u201cBut remember that people are free to walk anywhere in the city and go, for instance, to Costa Coffee.\u201d</p> <p>The centre will be launched this week by <a href=\"http://saferlivingfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Safer Living Foundation</a> (SLF), a partnership between HMP Whatton in Nottinghamshire and the school of social sciences at Nottingham Trent University.</p> <p>Lynn Saunders, chair and co-founder of SLF and governor of HMP Whatton, said the centre was a \u201cmuch needed resource\u201d.</p> <p>Winder added: \u201cWe\u2019re giving people somewhere to go to help them to build a better new life, to get the support they want rather than, for example, wandering around the train station.\u201d</p> <p>She added that two other UK regions had already expressed interest in adopting the model.</p> <p>10-14%</p> <p><strong><em>The reoffending rate for sex offenders in England and Wales</em></strong></p> <p>121,000</p> <p><strong><em>The number of sexual offences recorded by police in England and Wales in the year ending March 2017</em></strong></p> <p>14%</p> <p><strong><em>The increase in the number of sexual offences compared with 2016, the highest since the Sexual Offences Act was introduced in 2003 </em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Sex offenders will be given support to help find a job and make new friends under a pioneering scheme run by a university and backed by police. The initiative aims to integrate people back into society to prevent them committing further crimes. Offenders will visit a centre, the first of its kind in the UK, where they will receive employment training \u2013 from management skills to writing CVs \u2013 as well as help with building a supportive social circle, finding new hobbies or learning basic skills such as cooking. The strategy\u2019s advocates say that, while they realise it will be controversial, it will reduce reoffending rates. The aim is to work with up to 100 people in the first year. \u201cWe want to make sure they won\u2019t reoffend because they will have found a niche in society, a way of reintegrating,\u201d said Professor Belinda Winder, head of the sexual offences, crime and misconduct research unit at Nottingham Trent University, which is piloting the scheme. \u201cIt\u2019s for people who are going to be rejected, who feel desperate, lonely, isolated, a vicious circle which can contribute to reoffending. We are going to break that vicious cycle, but it\u2019s difficult to know if people are going to be able to stomach this.\u201d Although programmes already exist to help support convicted sex offenders, the Nottingham scheme, adopted by the Corbett Centre for Prisoner Reintegration, is said to be the world\u2019s first holistic approach to fully integrating sex offenders back into society. Last year the main sex offender treatment programme for England and Wales was scrapped by the Ministry of Justice after a report revealed it led to more reoffending. Researchers found that prisoners completing the programme \u2013 which was designed to challenge the behaviour of male sex offenders with psychological techniques to change their thinking \u2013 were more likely to commit further crimes. Reoffending rates for sex offenders are between 10 to 14%. The centre itself will have police from the Nottinghamshire\u2019s force on site at various times during the week so they can meet sex offenders on licence, a move that will help save time and resources tracking down their whereabouts. Nottinghamshire\u2019s police and crime commissioner Paddy Tipping said: \u201cThis groundbreaking piece of work will hopefully set the new standard for post-sentence reintegration into the community. It\u2019s absolutely logical. \u201cIf we can rehabilitate offenders and support them as they return to live in the community, they will be safer and less likely to reoffend. This in turn means there will be fewer victims of sexual abuse and harm. It\u2019s an ambitious project and I\u2019m proud to be involved.\u201d The centre will be housed at a university-owned building in the middle of the city. \u201cWe\u2019re mindful of the difficulties of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Winder. \u201cBut remember that people are free to walk anywhere in the city and go, for instance, to Costa Coffee.\u201d The centre will be launched this week by Safer Living Foundation (SLF), a partnership between HMP Whatton in Nottinghamshire and the school of social sciences at Nottingham Trent University. Lynn Saunders, chair and co-founder of SLF and governor of HMP Whatton, said the centre was a \u201cmuch needed resource\u201d. Winder added: \u201cWe\u2019re giving people somewhere to go to help them to build a better new life, to get the support they want rather than, for example, wandering around the train station.\u201d She added that two other UK regions had already expressed interest in adopting the model. 10-14% The reoffending rate for sex offenders in England and Wales 121,000 The number of sexual offences recorded by police in England and Wales in the year ending March 2017 14% The increase in the number of sexual offences compared with 2016, the highest since the Sexual Offences Act was introduced in 2003",

Damian Hinds, the education secretary, warned that only a 2% increase can be expected for the next academic year.</p> <p>The admission comes in the Department for Education\u2019s official submission to the School Teachers\u2019 Review Body, which makes recommendations on pay deals. It states that pay is also lower than it was 15 years ago in real terms. \u201cFrom 2002-03 to 2017-18, classroom teacher median salaries have seen a drop of 10% and overall teacher median salaries of 11% in real terms,\u201d it says. It argues that the fall was smaller than that suffered by private sector graduates.</p> <p>Unions have been calling for a 5% rise for the next academic year, arguing that low pay makes it hard to retain staff. Last year, about 60% of teachers <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/13222\" title=\"\">were expected to receive below-inflation awards</a>.</p> <p>Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: \u201cWe welcome the DfE\u2019s admission that teachers\u2019 pay has fallen so far in real terms. It is no good Damian Hinds trying to argue that this is the same for private sector jobs \u2013 those figures reflect the many graduates forced into low-paid, part-time, semi-casual jobs, whereas we are talking about the pay rates being offered to those joining a profession.\u201d</p> <p>The number of secondary school pupils is forecast to rise by 15% during the next decade. However, the government missed its recruitment targets for trainees for the past six years, with the biggest shortfalls in key subjects like maths, modern foreign languages and physics. Ministers have responded with a series of measures designed to ease the pressures with job shares, more support for new staff and a reduction in paperwork.</p> <p>James Zuccollo, from the Education Policy Institute, said there was evidence that \u201ctargeted pay increases\u201d could greatly reduce the looming crisis. \u201cRecent research suggests a 5% pay supplement for early-career science and maths teachers could have avoided the increased shortages since 2010, for instance,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe government\u2019s new bursary scheme for early-career teachers may help to tackle acute retention problems in shortage subjects and disadvantaged parts of the country. But, unless it is applied immediately to existing teachers, it is likely to be a few years before we see any improvements to exit rates.\u201d</p> <p>Hinds has announced that English schools will no longer be punished for failing to meet government standard on tests, in an attempt to release teachers from the stress of results and stop schools with challenging pupils from being punished. He also wants to cut down on marking, data collection and lesson planning.</p> <p>However, Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said years of cuts had led to teachers being \u201cthousands of pounds a year worse off. Across our schools we are seeing the result in the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention. Teacher recruitment targets have been missed year after year, with more teachers leaving the profession than joining. In response to this crisis, the government will give the majority of teachers another real-terms pay cut.\u201d</p> <p>Labour is pledging to end the public sector pay cap with additional, ring-fenced funding.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2019-02-09T17:45:15/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Teacher pay chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2019-02-09T17:45:15/embed.html\">Teacher pay chart</a> </figure>  <p>School leaders have been angered by a suggestion last week that they will have to fund this year\u2019s pay increase from their existing budget, without extra help from the government. A note from the department warned: \u201cA pay increase for teachers of 2%, in line with forecast inflation, is affordable within the overall funding available to schools for 2019 to 2020, without placing further pressure on school budgets.\u201d</p> <p>A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cLast summer saw the biggest teacher pay rise in almost 10 years, worth between \u00a3800 and \u00a31,366 for classroom teachers and supported by a \u00a3508m government grant. In addition to an annual pay award, many teachers also receive increases from promotions and responsibility allowances.</p> <p>\u201cWhilst we know pay is an important issue for teachers, there are also other factors which can affect recruitment and retention. That is why in January we unveiled the first ever integrated recruitment and retention strategy in England, which will provide teachers with more early careers support and opportunities for flexible and part-time working. The strategy also builds on the work we have done to support school leaders to strip away unnecessary workload.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ministers have conceded that teachers\u2019 pay has fallen by thousands of pounds a year since the public spending austerity drive began, amid warnings of a \u201clooming crisis\u201d in attracting and retaining new staff. Classroom pay has fallen by more than \u00a34,000 a year since 2010 in real terms, according to a government assessment. Damian Hinds, the education secretary, warned that only a 2% increase can be expected for the next academic year. The admission comes in the Department for Education\u2019s official submission to the School Teachers\u2019 Review Body, which makes recommendations on pay deals. It states that pay is also lower than it was 15 years ago in real terms. \u201cFrom 2002-03 to 2017-18, classroom teacher median salaries have seen a drop of 10% and overall teacher median salaries of 11% in real terms,\u201d it says. It argues that the fall was smaller than that suffered by private sector graduates. Unions have been calling for a 5% rise for the next academic year, arguing that low pay makes it hard to retain staff. Last year, about 60% of teachers were expected to receive below-inflation awards. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: \u201cWe welcome the DfE\u2019s admission that teachers\u2019 pay has fallen so far in real terms. It is no good Damian Hinds trying to argue that this is the same for private sector jobs \u2013 those figures reflect the many graduates forced into low-paid, part-time, semi-casual jobs, whereas we are talking about the pay rates being offered to those joining a profession.\u201d The number of secondary school pupils is forecast to rise by 15% during the next decade. However, the government missed its recruitment targets for trainees for the past six years, with the biggest shortfalls in key subjects like maths, modern foreign languages and physics. Ministers have responded with a series of measures designed to ease the pressures with job shares, more support for new staff and a reduction in paperwork. James Zuccollo, from the Education Policy Institute, said there was evidence that \u201ctargeted pay increases\u201d could greatly reduce the looming crisis. \u201cRecent research suggests a 5% pay supplement for early-career science and maths teachers could have avoided the increased shortages since 2010, for instance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government\u2019s new bursary scheme for early-career teachers may help to tackle acute retention problems in shortage subjects and disadvantaged parts of the country. But, unless it is applied immediately to existing teachers, it is likely to be a few years before we see any improvements to exit rates.\u201d Hinds has announced that English schools will no longer be punished for failing to meet government standard on tests, in an attempt to release teachers from the stress of results and stop schools with challenging pupils from being punished. He also wants to cut down on marking, data collection and lesson planning. However, Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said years of cuts had led to teachers being \u201cthousands of pounds a year worse off. Across our schools we are seeing the result in the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention. Teacher recruitment targets have been missed year after year, with more teachers leaving the profession than joining. In response to this crisis, the government will give the majority of teachers another real-terms pay cut.\u201d Labour is pledging to end the public sector pay cap with additional, ring-fenced funding. School leaders have been angered by a suggestion last week that they will have to fund this year\u2019s pay increase from their existing budget, without extra help from the government. A note from the department warned: \u201cA pay increase for teachers of 2%, in line with forecast inflation, is affordable within the overall funding available to schools for 2019 to 2020, without placing further pressure on school budgets.\u201d A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cLast summer saw the biggest teacher pay rise in almost 10 years, worth between \u00a3800 and \u00a31,366 for classroom teachers and supported by a \u00a3508m government grant. In addition to an annual pay award, many teachers also receive increases from promotions and responsibility allowances. \u201cWhilst we know pay is an important issue for teachers, there are also other factors which can affect recruitment and retention. That is why in January we unveiled the first ever integrated recruitment and retention strategy in England, which will provide teachers with more early careers support and opportunities for flexible and part-time working. The strategy also builds on the work we have done to support school leaders to strip away unnecessary workload.\u201d",

Speculation was rife that the world\u2019s most powerful man had weaponized a supermarket tabloid to go after the world\u2019s richest. Trump, 72, and 55-year-old Bezos do, after all, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/17/donald-trump-jeff-bezos-amazon-washington-post-power-money\">have a keen rivalry,</a> at least in the president\u2019s mind.</p> <p>Bezos, who founded Amazon as an online bookseller in 1994 and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/jeff-bezos-on-post-purchase/2013/08/05/e5b293de-fe0d-11e2-9711-3708310f6f4d_story.html?utm_term=.253817a4e7c0\">bought the Washington Post in 2013,</a> is now worth $136bn, a fortune that dwarfs Trump\u2019s. For three years Trump has attacked him on Twitter, spuriously accusing Amazon of dodging taxes at the expense of the post office and the Post of trafficking in \u201cfake news\u201d. But Bezos has kept his cool and refused to take the bait, probably riling the president even more.</p> <p>Bezos\u2019s personal life came under unwelcome scrutiny a month ago in almost Trumpian style, however.

The tabloid reported that Bezos sent \u201csleazy text messages and gushing love notes\u201d to Sanchez. </p> <p>It is safe to assume that no previous US president would have passed comment. But Trump could not conceal his sense of <em>schadenfreude</em>. \u201cSo sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1084627451983073280\">he gloated on Twitter.</a> \u201cHopefully the paper will soon be placed in better &amp; more responsible hands!\u201d</p> <p>That was not the end, however.</p> <p>With almost unlimited resources at his disposal, Bezos hired a crack team of private investigators to find out how the Enquirer had got its hands on his text messages and photos. David Pecker, owner of the Enquirer and longtime friend of Trump, was \u201capoplectic\u201d when he learned the tables had been turned, according to Bezos\u2019s blogpost, and threatened to publish more material unless Bezos called his investigators off.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/09/he-ran-his-own-race-australian-journalist-named-in-bezos-email-affair\">Enquirer editor Dylan Howard</a> allegedly sent an email warning of nine intimate images in excruciating detail.

      "bodyText": "Another Hollywood awards ceremony passed with the usual red carpet fashion show, earnest acceptance speeches and mingling of the rich and famous. So few found it remarkable when billionaire Jeff Bezos, chief executive of Amazon, was photographed at an after-party with TV presenter and helicopter pilot Lauren Sanchez. But just a few days after the Golden Globes, it would become clear this picture was a crucial clue to the unravelling of Bezos\u2019s 25-year marriage \u2013 and a tangled web of intrigue now spanning the worlds of Washington politics, New York tabloids and Los Angeles showbusiness. Add into the mix this week some lurid photographs, allegations of blackmail and a put-it-all-out-there blogpost by Bezos, and the man who gave the world \u201cThe Everything Store\u201d had delivered \u201cThe Everything Scandal\u201d \u2013 possibly all the way to the doorstep of the American president and his allies in Saudi Arabia. In an era when every controversy seems to have a connection to Donald Trump, there was of course a connection to him. Speculation was rife that the world\u2019s most powerful man had weaponized a supermarket tabloid to go after the world\u2019s richest. Trump, 72, and 55-year-old Bezos do, after all, have a keen rivalry, at least in the president\u2019s mind. Bezos, who founded Amazon as an online bookseller in 1994 and bought the Washington Post in 2013, is now worth $136bn, a fortune that dwarfs Trump\u2019s. For three years Trump has attacked him on Twitter, spuriously accusing Amazon of dodging taxes at the expense of the post office and the Post of trafficking in \u201cfake news\u201d. But Bezos has kept his cool and refused to take the bait, probably riling the president even more. Bezos\u2019s personal life came under unwelcome scrutiny a month ago in almost Trumpian style, however. On 9 January, three days after the Golden Globes, he used Twitter to announce his divorce from novelist MacKenzie Bezos. The following day, the National Enquirer tabloid revealed Bezos\u2019s extramarital affair with Sanchez, 49, a former host of So You Think You Can Dance? now in the process of divorcing her husband. In coverage sprawling across 11 pages, the Enquirer said its reporters followed Bezos and Sanchez \u201cacross five states and 40,000 miles\u201d and \u201ctailed them in private jets, swanky limos, helicopter rides, romantic hikes, five-star hotel hideaways, intimate dinner dates and \u2018quality time\u2019 in hidden love nests\u201d. The tabloid reported that Bezos sent \u201csleazy text messages and gushing love notes\u201d to Sanchez. It is safe to assume that no previous US president would have passed comment. But Trump could not conceal his sense of schadenfreude. \u201cSo sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post,\u201d he gloated on Twitter. \u201cHopefully the paper will soon be placed in better &amp; more responsible hands!\u201d That was not the end, however. With almost unlimited resources at his disposal, Bezos hired a crack team of private investigators to find out how the Enquirer had got its hands on his text messages and photos. David Pecker, owner of the Enquirer and longtime friend of Trump, was \u201capoplectic\u201d when he learned the tables had been turned, according to Bezos\u2019s blogpost, and threatened to publish more material unless Bezos called his investigators off. Enquirer editor Dylan Howard allegedly sent an email warning of nine intimate images in excruciating detail. They included a \u201cbelow the belt selfie \u2014 otherwise colloquially known as a dick pick\u201d. By Bezos\u2019s account, Pecker\u2019s team made an offer: the Enquirer would agree to not publish the photos if Bezos and his investigators released a public statement \u201caffirming that they have no knowledge or basis\u201d to suggest the tabloid\u2019s coverage was \u201cpolitically motivated or influenced by political forces\u201d. Bezos refused and punched the bully instead. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t want personal photos published, but I also won\u2019t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption,\u201d he writes. \u201cI prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.\u201d His blogpost, published on the neutral Medium website under the title \u201cNo thank you, Mr Pecker\u201d, flipped the script and earned widespread approbation. Journalist Carl Bernstein, who reported on the Watergate saga, told CNN that Bezos \u201cin this instance has acted heroically, in terms of establishing that neither he nor the Post will be intimidated\u201d.

You captain a ship and, with a ragtag crew of gobbing sailors, travel the high seas, with all their uncharted archipelagos, in search of profit and adventure and stories. It\u2019s a tale that remains resolutely in fashion, except, as told by Failbetter Games \u2013 an independent London studio with a deserved reputation for stylish role-playing games and sharply observed writing \u2013 the familiar recipe is darkly, exhilaratingly perverted. Your ship is, in fact, a flying steam locomotive, and here the high seas are cloying clouds set in a subterranean sky. Most chastening is the fact that, unlike the writers of penny novellas of the 19th century, the game\u2019s authors are only too eager to kill you, the protagonist, off following an ill-prepared sortie or a lacklustre dice-roll.

The words were probably not intended as navel gazing. But they lend themselves well to the enigma wrapped in a wayfarer that is McCombs.</p> <p>He has long been a hard singer-songwriter to get hold of, literally and metaphorically. Since coming gradually into renown over a period of 20 years, the native Californian has sofa-surfed and periodically worked in construction; he once <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/02/interview-cass-mccombs.html\" title=\"\">painted the walls of a flat in Trump Tower</a>. Around the release of his 2011 album, <em>Wit\u2019s End</em>, McCombs compounded his elusive reputation by requiring journalists to <a href=\"https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/cass-mccombs-humor-risk\" title=\"\">interview him by snailmail</a>. He hung out with fellow musicians in LA, Brooklyn, Maryland, London, wherever. \u201cI\u2019m totally supported by my friends,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.spin.com/2013/10/cass-mccombs-big-wheel-and-others-interview/\" title=\"\">told an interviewer in 2013</a>, around the time of his <em>Big Wheel and Others</em> album. \u201cThat\u2019s how I exist.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/26/vampire-weekend-founding-member-rostam-batmanglij-quits-band\" title=\"\">Rostam Batmanglij, formerly of Vampire Weekend</a>, dubbed McCombs\u2019 true-believer notoriety among other musicians \u201cthe cult of Cass\u201d.</p> <p>For a maverick never much given to explaining his moves, his actual music is not especially forbidding. Rooted loosely in indie rock \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/mar/19/popandrock.elliottsmith\" title=\"\">Elliott Smith</a> is a reference point \u2013 McCombs takes in canonic influences (Bob Dylan, Neil Young), is informed by blues, the hippie era, the Grateful Dead, psychedelics. But his lyrical output can tend to the gnomic and cosmic, even as it often has its roots in storytelling and the everyman experience. His penchant for the oblique is part of the reason this fortysomething troubadour has mooched about, just shy of the gate to the American songwriters\u2019 pantheon, for so long.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>You lose count of the instruments puttering around unobtrusively in the background, never yelling \u2018saxophone\u2019 at you</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, McCombs rewards deep listening. <em>Tip of the Spheres</em> is his ninth studio album of ever-expansive Americana, one where his myth properly matures. It follows the excellent showing of his 2016 expanded palette of an album, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/28/cass-mccombs-mangy-love-review-run-sister-run-opposite-house-low-flying-bird\" title=\"\">Mangy Love</a></em>, in numerous end-of-year lists.</p> <p>As before, McCombs has filled 11 tracks with a wide range of inputs, from country to ragtime to jazz; the excellent production and looming sense of space here is a marker of how far his musicality has come. One song, Real Life, turns on a dime from one mood into another; you lose count of the instruments puttering around unobtrusively in the background, never yelling \u201csaxophone\u201d at you.</p> <p><em>Tip of the Sphere</em> plays with place and placelessness (California, the void), with legends and shadows, \u201cauthentic fakes\u201d and \u201ccuckooland\u201d, all the while being a record you can comfortably spin in the background, until it demands your attention thanks to some unexpectedly engrossing music, or a puzzle. The final track, Rounder, is a lengthy, choogling boogie that makes you hate the Grateful Dead just a little less. Another song, American Canyon Sutra, is intoned beat poetry about a rubbish dump. It should misfire but doesn\u2019t, weaving personal recollection into \u201cthe bottomless canyon of nightmares\u201d via groovy soul.</p> <p>McCombs\u2019 lack of interest in easy interpretations endures and, if anything, prettifies, on this engrossing record. Spheres, of course, have no tips \u2013 they are perfectly round.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhat do you call yourself, if anything?\u201d wonders the opening couplet of Cass McCombs\u2019 new album, Tip of the Sphere. The words were probably not intended as navel gazing. But they lend themselves well to the enigma wrapped in a wayfarer that is McCombs. He has long been a hard singer-songwriter to get hold of, literally and metaphorically. Since coming gradually into renown over a period of 20 years, the native Californian has sofa-surfed and periodically worked in construction; he once painted the walls of a flat in Trump Tower. Around the release of his 2011 album, Wit\u2019s End, McCombs compounded his elusive reputation by requiring journalists to interview him by snailmail. He hung out with fellow musicians in LA, Brooklyn, Maryland, London, wherever. \u201cI\u2019m totally supported by my friends,\u201d he told an interviewer in 2013, around the time of his Big Wheel and Others album. \u201cThat\u2019s how I exist.\u201d Rostam Batmanglij, formerly of Vampire Weekend, dubbed McCombs\u2019 true-believer notoriety among other musicians \u201cthe cult of Cass\u201d. For a maverick never much given to explaining his moves, his actual music is not especially forbidding. Rooted loosely in indie rock \u2013 Elliott Smith is a reference point \u2013 McCombs takes in canonic influences (Bob Dylan, Neil Young), is informed by blues, the hippie era, the Grateful Dead, psychedelics. But his lyrical output can tend to the gnomic and cosmic, even as it often has its roots in storytelling and the everyman experience. His penchant for the oblique is part of the reason this fortysomething troubadour has mooched about, just shy of the gate to the American songwriters\u2019 pantheon, for so long. Of course, McCombs rewards deep listening. Tip of the Spheres is his ninth studio album of ever-expansive Americana, one where his myth properly matures. It follows the excellent showing of his 2016 expanded palette of an album, Mangy Love, in numerous end-of-year lists. As before, McCombs has filled 11 tracks with a wide range of inputs, from country to ragtime to jazz; the excellent production and looming sense of space here is a marker of how far his musicality has come. One song, Real Life, turns on a dime from one mood into another; you lose count of the instruments puttering around unobtrusively in the background, never yelling \u201csaxophone\u201d at you. Tip of the Sphere plays with place and placelessness (California, the void), with legends and shadows, \u201cauthentic fakes\u201d and \u201ccuckooland\u201d, all the while being a record you can comfortably spin in the background, until it demands your attention thanks to some unexpectedly engrossing music, or a puzzle. The final track, Rounder, is a lengthy, choogling boogie that makes you hate the Grateful Dead just a little less. Another song, American Canyon Sutra, is intoned beat poetry about a rubbish dump. It should misfire but doesn\u2019t, weaving personal recollection into \u201cthe bottomless canyon of nightmares\u201d via groovy soul. McCombs\u2019 lack of interest in easy interpretations endures and, if anything, prettifies, on this engrossing record. Spheres, of course, have no tips \u2013 they are perfectly round. The album\u2019s title is likely to be a pun on the military phrase \u201cthe tip of the spear\u201d \u2013 one that refers to the first combatants into battle who pierce the enemy line so that the main body can follow \u2013 but given a celestial McCombs tilt. A few threads are graspable through McCombs\u2019 will-o\u2019 the wisp-like work. He looked askance at state-sanctioned violence towards Chelsea Manning on the song Bradley Manning (from 2012\u2019s B-sides and outtakes, A Folk Set Apart) which recounts the ballad of the WikiLeaks whistleblower\u2019s experiences at the hands of the military. It wasn\u2019t McCombs\u2019 only \u201cpolitical\u201d moment, just one of his most overt. McCombs plays with language too, searching less for the humour in puns than the hidden avenues in pat phrases. Here, Sleeping Volcanoes is an easy-going tune that invites you in, before wrong-footing you. \u201cHelp me, Armageddon,\u201d runs the chorus, a plea at odds with the band playing out blithely. The entire album has an eye on the end of days; McCombs has said that the song is about \u201cpeople passing each other on the sidewalk unaware of the emotional volatility they are brushing past, like a sleeping volcano that could erupt at any moment\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re all over the world,\u201d goes one recurring lyric. The initial gist of \u201call over the world\u201d is \u201cwidespread\u201d \u2013 but that changes. By the end, \u201cwe\u2019re all over the world\u201d means \u201cwe are all sick of the status quo\u201d. (\u201cWe\u2019re over it!\u201d McCombs quips, cheerily.) There follows a riff on the words \u201cworld\u201d and \u201cwar\u201d, reinforcing the song\u2019s doomy prognosis, and the idea of the slipperiness of language. \u201cUntil the next world/ The third world or the next world war/ Class war all over this world/ We\u2019re all over the world.\u201d The mellow tune carries on. Elsewhere, McCombs\u2019 songwriting becomes more personal, then less, defying easy categorisation. Tying Up Loose Ends (\u201cbefore I gotta go\u201d) discusses family photos with burnished instrumentation taking centre stage; finality lurks in the wings.

      "body": "<p>This seems an appropriate time for Paul Lambert to be talking about self\u2011confidence. He is sitting in his office at Ipswich\u2019s training ground and remembering how not even an uncompromising apprenticeship in Glasgow could prepare him for what he faced when, in 1996, he entered a \u201chard as nails\u201d dressing room at Borussia Dortmund.</p> <p>\u201cBefore I went there I wasn\u2019t as strong as I am now,\u201d he says. \u201cIt changed my entire outlook. Big, big players and I became one of them.\u201d</p> <p>He reels off a list from the squad with which he won the 1997 Champions League: M\u00f6ller, Riedle, Sammer, Chapuisat, Sousa, Kohler. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that if you ask anyone how vital I was to them, they\u2019d say I was really important. I won things there and it made me so unbelievably focused and self\u2011confident. Never arrogant. I know the standards, I know the situations that happen, I know how to handle atmospheres or people criticising me. It\u2019s no problem.\u201d</p> <p>That rhino hide was developed for situations like the one he will face on Sunday lunchtime. Eight years ago, Lambert had Carrow Road under his spell; Norwich would achieve a second consecutive promotion in 2010-11, the middle of his three seasons in charge, and would win their derby fixtures by an aggregate of 9-2. The possibilities seemed endless: it was just that, among them, nobody considered he might one day walk into the same arena, braced for dog\u2019s abuse, to manage an Ipswich team adrift at the bottom of the Championship.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I thrive on the pressure. I love the fear factor that goes with it. Perhaps it\u2019s strange, but that\u2019s just me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI thrive on the pressure,\u201d he says. \u201cI love it. I love the fear factor that goes with it. Perhaps it\u2019s strange, but that\u2019s just me.\u201d</p> <p>East Anglia\u2019s blue section is feeling the fear. A precis of Ipswich\u2019s last decade is that the club fell asleep on the job and Sunday\u2019s scenario, facing rivals who look destined for promotion, is a stark consequence. It raises the question of what Lambert, hardly unemployable after a decent fist at escaping relegation from last season\u2019s top-flight with Stoke, was thinking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/27/ipswich-appoint-former-norwich-manager-paul-lambert\" title=\"\">when he picked up the pieces</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/25/ipswich-sack-paul-hurst-poor-start\" title=\"\">Paul Hurst\u2019s short-lived reign</a> in October.</p> <p>\u201cThis year I\u2019m 50 and I think what I had to do \u2026\u201d He tails off, before pointing out that he has not overseen a pre-season since 2014-15, his final campaign at Aston Villa. \u201cYou look at that, you can\u2019t keep doing it,\u201d he says. He wanted to settle into a project and escape the unwelcome perception of a firefighter, a short-term gun for hire, that had formed after brief spells at Blackburn, Wolves and Stoke.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/08/aston-villa-sheffield-united-match-report\">Andre Green caps astonishing Aston Villa comeback against Sheffield United</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ipswich\u2019s owner, Marcus Evans, offered Lambert that chance to get his feet under the table. He sees vast potential beyond the league position and spots a chance to correct some of his own mistakes. Lambert felt drained by the straitened circumstances he had faced at Villa. He felt he had taken on too much and, upon leaving, told himself: \u201cI\u2019m not going through all that again; I\u2019m going to change.\u201d He toured Europe on a break that, he says, \u201ctaught me to live and laugh again\u201d, visiting Barcelona and Real Madrid while calling in favours from a string of Bundesliga contacts.</p> <p>One of them, the then Bayer Leverkusen manager, Roger Schmidt, asked him why he had frequently changed system as Villa slid down the table. \u201cI was just trying to get a result,\u201d Lambert told his friend. \u201cYou\u2019ll confuse the players,\u201d Schmidt told him. \u201cI\u2019d been confusing myself with the systems. Back three, four, five, two in the middle, three, couldn\u2019t get the result,\u201d Lambert says. \u201cHe was right. I decided I wasn\u2019t going to waver from that advice.\u201d</p> <p>Lambert\u2019s departure from Norwich for Villa in June 2012, after City had finished 12th in the Premier League, was acrimonious and resulted in a legal dispute that lasted six months. On his returns with Villa, the home support rarely spared him their feelings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been criticised or booed when I\u2019m back there, but for three years I gave them everything I had. I gave you [Norwich] everything: I gave you promotion to the Championship, promotion to the Premier League, finances that a million per cent helped the club. What we did, as staff and players, helped it become the way it is. I\u2019ve never actually gone there and thought: \u2018Do you know what, I\u2019ll get a good reception.\u2019 Never.\u201d</p> <p>It seems an unnatural situation for somebody who is written into the club\u2019s hall of fame. \u201cBecause of what\u2019s happened there, the feeling is not normal, not normal.\u201d</p> <p>He describes his situation at Ipswich as not normal too. There was the risk that, at a club he felt was \u201cso down, so detached from the town\u201d when he arrived, his past might stretch tolerance levels further. Within days he set to work on its core: the training ground was opened to club legends such as George Burley, John Wark and Terry Butcher, who had been allowed to drift away; he has initiated meetings with Blue Action, a supporters\u2019 group; last month he funded 50 fans\u2019 travel to Blackburn. The football has been slicker, if not yet persuasive of a miracle escape, but he has succeeded in one sense already: it does not feel, beneath the bonnet, like a club facing the abyss.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a huge club but it was drifting: no enthusiasm, no urgency, an acceptance. The supporters didn\u2019t like the team; the team perhaps didn\u2019t like to play in front of them. But I felt that if you can galvanise this place, whatever division it\u2019s in, it will be unbelievable. This could be anything it wants to be, really.\u201d</p> <p>Ipswich want to remain a Championship club but Lambert says he is committed regardless of this season\u2019s fate. \u201cThere\u2019s so much good here if we grab it and all drive the same way.\u201d</p> <p>Many of Lambert\u2019s former players speak reverentially about an uncanny ability to bring people with him. After 50 minutes in his company you understand why: anyone ignorant of the context would leave persuaded that Ipswich, not Norwich, had the wind in their sails going into the derby. That self\u2011confidence, honed in the Ruhr, is never far from the surface.</p> <p>\u201cThe game can be a catalyst and then this place will be moving,\u201d he says. \u201cI know how difficult it is. Norwich have made great strides and we\u2019re playing catch-up. But at the end of the day it\u2019s a football match and we\u2019re going there to win.\u201d</p>",

He is sitting in his office at Ipswich\u2019s training ground and remembering how not even an uncompromising apprenticeship in Glasgow could prepare him for what he faced when, in 1996, he entered a \u201chard as nails\u201d dressing room at Borussia Dortmund. \u201cBefore I went there I wasn\u2019t as strong as I am now,\u201d he says. \u201cIt changed my entire outlook. Big, big players and I became one of them.\u201d He reels off a list from the squad with which he won the 1997 Champions League: M\u00f6ller, Riedle, Sammer, Chapuisat, Sousa, Kohler. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that if you ask anyone how vital I was to them, they\u2019d say I was really important. I won things there and it made me so unbelievably focused and self\u2011confident. Never arrogant. I know the standards, I know the situations that happen, I know how to handle atmospheres or people criticising me. It\u2019s no problem.\u201d That rhino hide was developed for situations like the one he will face on Sunday lunchtime. Eight years ago, Lambert had Carrow Road under his spell; Norwich would achieve a second consecutive promotion in 2010-11, the middle of his three seasons in charge, and would win their derby fixtures by an aggregate of 9-2. The possibilities seemed endless: it was just that, among them, nobody considered he might one day walk into the same arena, braced for dog\u2019s abuse, to manage an Ipswich team adrift at the bottom of the Championship. \u201cI thrive on the pressure,\u201d he says. \u201cI love it. I love the fear factor that goes with it. Perhaps it\u2019s strange, but that\u2019s just me.\u201d East Anglia\u2019s blue section is feeling the fear. A precis of Ipswich\u2019s last decade is that the club fell asleep on the job and Sunday\u2019s scenario, facing rivals who look destined for promotion, is a stark consequence. It raises the question of what Lambert, hardly unemployable after a decent fist at escaping relegation from last season\u2019s top-flight with Stoke, was thinking when he picked up the pieces of Paul Hurst\u2019s short-lived reign in October. \u201cThis year I\u2019m 50 and I think what I had to do \u2026\u201d He tails off, before pointing out that he has not overseen a pre-season since 2014-15, his final campaign at Aston Villa. \u201cYou look at that, you can\u2019t keep doing it,\u201d he says. He wanted to settle into a project and escape the unwelcome perception of a firefighter, a short-term gun for hire, that had formed after brief spells at Blackburn, Wolves and Stoke. Ipswich\u2019s owner, Marcus Evans, offered Lambert that chance to get his feet under the table. He sees vast potential beyond the league position and spots a chance to correct some of his own mistakes. Lambert felt drained by the straitened circumstances he had faced at Villa. He felt he had taken on too much and, upon leaving, told himself: \u201cI\u2019m not going through all that again; I\u2019m going to change.\u201d He toured Europe on a break that, he says, \u201ctaught me to live and laugh again\u201d, visiting Barcelona and Real Madrid while calling in favours from a string of Bundesliga contacts. One of them, the then Bayer Leverkusen manager, Roger Schmidt, asked him why he had frequently changed system as Villa slid down the table. \u201cI was just trying to get a result,\u201d Lambert told his friend. \u201cYou\u2019ll confuse the players,\u201d Schmidt told him. \u201cI\u2019d been confusing myself with the systems. Back three, four, five, two in the middle, three, couldn\u2019t get the result,\u201d Lambert says. \u201cHe was right. I decided I wasn\u2019t going to waver from that advice.\u201d Lambert\u2019s departure from Norwich for Villa in June 2012, after City had finished 12th in the Premier League, was acrimonious and resulted in a legal dispute that lasted six months. On his returns with Villa, the home support rarely spared him their feelings. \u201cI\u2019ve always been criticised or booed when I\u2019m back there, but for three years I gave them everything I had. I gave you [Norwich] everything: I gave you promotion to the Championship, promotion to the Premier League, finances that a million per cent helped the club. What we did, as staff and players, helped it become the way it is. I\u2019ve never actually gone there and thought: \u2018Do you know what, I\u2019ll get a good reception.\u2019 Never.\u201d It seems an unnatural situation for somebody who is written into the club\u2019s hall of fame. \u201cBecause of what\u2019s happened there, the feeling is not normal, not normal.\u201d He describes his situation at Ipswich as not normal too. There was the risk that, at a club he felt was \u201cso down, so detached from the town\u201d when he arrived, his past might stretch tolerance levels further. Within days he set to work on its core: the training ground was opened to club legends such as George Burley, John Wark and Terry Butcher, who had been allowed to drift away; he has initiated meetings with Blue Action, a supporters\u2019 group; last month he funded 50 fans\u2019 travel to Blackburn. The football has been slicker, if not yet persuasive of a miracle escape, but he has succeeded in one sense already: it does not feel, beneath the bonnet, like a club facing the abyss. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge club but it was drifting: no enthusiasm, no urgency, an acceptance. The supporters didn\u2019t like the team; the team perhaps didn\u2019t like to play in front of them. But I felt that if you can galvanise this place, whatever division it\u2019s in, it will be unbelievable. This could be anything it wants to be, really.\u201d Ipswich want to remain a Championship club but Lambert says he is committed regardless of this season\u2019s fate. \u201cThere\u2019s so much good here if we grab it and all drive the same way.\u201d Many of Lambert\u2019s former players speak reverentially about an uncanny ability to bring people with him. After 50 minutes in his company you understand why: anyone ignorant of the context would leave persuaded that Ipswich, not Norwich, had the wind in their sails going into the derby. That self\u2011confidence, honed in the Ruhr, is never far from the surface. \u201cThe game can be a catalyst and then this place will be moving,\u201d he says. \u201cI know how difficult it is. Norwich have made great strides and we\u2019re playing catch-up. But at the end of the day it\u2019s a football match and we\u2019re going there to win.\u201d",

Cl\u00e1udio Castro, the vice governor of Rio de Janeiro state, said authorities were looking at the possibility of a short circuit in an air conditioning unit. Samuel Barbosa, a 16-year-old player who survived the fire, told Globo TV news that a lot of smoke had filled the dorm. \u201cMost didn\u2019t make it because there was so much fire,\u201d he said. The city said in a statement that the area burned was registered for parking, not as a dormitory, and that an investigation into the licensing process was underway. Beatriz Busch, the state\u2019s public health secretary, said three other players had been injured in the fire. Two were in stable condition, but the third was critically ill. Several people who appeared to be relatives entered the complex on Friday night without speaking to reporters. Some were crying. \u201cWe are distraught,\u201d Flamengo\u2019s president, Rodolfo Landim, said outside the complex. \u201cThis is the worst tragedy to happen to the club in its 123 years. \u201cThe most important thing right now is to minimise the suffering of these families.\u201d Rio\u2019s mayor, Marcelo Crivella, ordered three days of mourning, while Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, lamented the fire had taken \u201cthe young lives at the beginning of pursuing their professional dreams\u201d.

Defender Pablo, 14, had been with Flamengo since last year and his cousin, Werley, was already playing professionally with rival Vasco da Gama.

      "body": "<p>I wanted to be a journalist from an early age \u2013 the age when most of my (male) contemporaries out there in west Wimbledon had set their sights on becoming footballers or engine drivers.</p> <p>At Wimbledon College I produced an underground (handwritten) newspaper and dabbled in undergraduate journalism at Cambridge in the early 1960s. In those days, although I read economics \u2013 because I wanted to understand politics \u2013 I had no idea that I would take up economic journalism as a career. But the field began to narrow when I heard the <em>Financial Time</em>s took one or two recruits straight from university.</p> <p>The scales were removed from my eyes during an interview with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2001/jun/16/features.jobsmoney3\" title=\"\">Sir Gordon Newton</a>, the <em>FT</em>\u2019s then editor, when I was firmly told that the cuttings of which I was most proud were \u201cnot up to it\u201d \u2013 but there was one that suggested I had potential as an <em>FT</em> reporter. From then I never looked back, and in 1977 I joined the <em>Observer,</em> first as economics correspondent, then as economics editor.</p> <p>One interesting change I have noticed is the way that economic and business coverage is much more prominent, not to say all-pervasive, than it used to be. When I came into economic journalism one had to work hard and win people\u2019s trust in order to gain background information, let alone a \u201cquote\u201d. But one gets the impression these days that people are vying to let the world know what they think \u2013 not least in their much-publicised tweets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/10/happiness-aminatta-forna-nine-crises-william-keegan-the-wolf-and-the-watchman-reviews\">In brief: Happiness; Nine Crises; The Wolf and the Watchman \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In terms of the recurring themes over the period covered by these nine crises, I find two that stand out. One is the constant search by British policymakers for an economic panacea, and the second is the way that certain obsessions take over in the coverage of economics. In the 1960s and 70s the obsession was with the overseas trade figures and the balance of payments; nowadays these hardly get a mention, even though the underlying position is much worse than it was then.</p> <p>The modern obsession is with the budget deficit, which received precious little attention in earlier decades. And, of course, the 2016 referendum and prospect of Brexit have, for good reasons, taken over as the main focus of economic news. Welcome to the ninth of my crises\u2026 and to the eight that preceded it.</p> <h2>1 Devaluation </h2> <p>1967<br>In November 1967 the Labour prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/may/25/obituaries\" title=\"\">Harold Wilson</a>, took the decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/feb/28/3\" title=\"\">devalue the pound</a> by 14.3%.</p> <p>He had resisted devaluation for three years, against official advice that it would restore export competitiveness, but in the end it was forced upon him by the markets.</p> <p>Wilson, trying to get across to the public that it was the price of imports that would be significantly hit, rather than people\u2019s total spending power, was nevertheless widely mocked for saying that \u201cthe pound in your pocket has not been devalued\u201d.</p> <h2>2 The oil crisis and the three-day week</h2> <p>1973<br>The Conservative government under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/04/edward-heath-philip-ziegler-review\" title=\"\">Edward Heath</a> \u2013 1970-74 \u2013 tried to take on the unions by restricting their power \u2013 but it failed.</p> <p>Heath\u2019s mistake was not to recognise that the market power of the miners had been dramatically increased by the impact of the oil-exporting countries (Opec), which had quintupled the price of oil in the autumn of 1973.</p> <p>A miners\u2019 strike provoked disruption to electricity supplies and the nation was put briefly on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gallery/2009/apr/16/past-conservatives\" title=\"\">three-day week</a>.</p> <p>Heath held an election on \u201cwho governs?\u201d\u2026 and lost.</p> <h2>3 The IMF crisis</h2> <p>1976<br>Once again a Labour government was returned with all manner of good intentions, but bedevilled by \u201cevents\u201d. It inherited an \u201cinflationary spiral\u201d. In one of the worst-timed but best-intended economic policy moves of the post-1945 era, the Heath government had linked wage increases to the cost of living on the eve of the oil shock.</p> <p>The government, by this time led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/28/guardianobituaries.politics\" title=\"\">James Callaghan</a>, had, in a popular phrase, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/22/monetarism-economic-theory-bank-of-england-government\" title=\"\">to go cap in hand</a>\u201d to the International Monetary Fund in humiliating circumstances.</p> <h2>4 Thatcher recession</h2> <p>1979-82 <br>The Thatcher government came in having adopted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/nov/16/post650\" title=\"\">monetarist doctrines</a> of Professor Milton Friedman. The message was that all they needed to do to control inflation was to control the money supply. This proved a false god, and many years later monetarism was disowned by Friedman himself.</p> <p>But having promised to control inflation, the Thatcher government saw a rise in the rate from an inherited 10% to more than 20% a year later.</p> <p>Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/21/margaret-thatcher-woman-legend-myths\" title=\"\">experienced its worst recession</a> since the 1930s, and the pain inflicted on society and manufacturing was such that unemployment went on rising to more than 3 million by 1986.</p> <h2>5 Lawson boom-and-bust and Thatcher</h2> <p>1983-89<br>Nigel Lawson, chancellor 1983-89, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/06/economics.economicgrowth\" title=\"\">at heart an expansionist</a>. He produced an expansionary budget in 1988, in the middle of a campaign to persuade Thatcher that the answer to Britain\u2019s endemic inflation problem was to emulate the far more successful Germans. He failed to persuade Thatcher to put the pound into the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) but instructed the Bank of England to \u201cshadow the deutschmark\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab78f39312be259b1a5b4b36a715853e941661ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab78f39312be259b1a5b4b36a715853e941661ef/0_19_4950_2970/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher with Nigel Lawson, left\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher with Nigel Lawson, left, in 1987.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It all ended in tears when Thatcher found out, and the last straw for Lawson was the reappearance on the scene of Thatcher\u2019s economic adviser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/06/sir-alan-walters-obituary\" title=\"\">Sir Alan Walters</a>, which provoked him to resign.</p> <h2>6 Black Wednesday</h2> <p>1992<br>The Lawson boom led to another splurge in inflation, with the annualised rate of increase peaking at 10.9% in the autumn of 1990. By this time John Major had been chancellor for a year and, along with the rest of the establishment, had worn Thatcher\u2019s resistance down.</p> <p>The pound was put into the ERM. This was the worst possible time to hook the pound to what was in effect a deutschmark zone, because the good news about German reunification in 1989 was soon followed by the bad news of the impact of unification on German inflation. It took the second-worst recession \u2013 1990-92 \u2013 since the 1930s to bring UK inflation down again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fab214a59896600c4d0386f156621f8cedfc407d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fab214a59896600c4d0386f156621f8cedfc407d/0_2_5234_3139/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Wednesday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A City worker buys a paper on Black Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Baker/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The need to keep the pound in the ERM involved cripplingly high interest rates. Finally, by 16 September 1992, the policy was seen to be unsustainable and the Bank of England spent most of its currency reserves in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-20-years-pound-erm\" title=\"\">a vain attempt</a> to prop up the pound.</p> <h2>7 Financial crash</h2> <p>2007-2009 <br>By 2007, policymakers believed that, with the aid of the latest panacea, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jun/26/interestrates.inflation\" title=\"\">inflation targeting</a>\u201d \u2013 entrusted to an independent Bank of England in 1997 \u2013 they had found the economic philosopher\u2019s stone. Alas, in Britain and elsewhere, they took their eyes off the \u201cfinancial stability\u201d ball.</p> <p>The crash a decade ago was, in the words of Nicholas Macpherson, Treasury permanent secretary under both Labour and the Conservatives, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/03/senior-tory-financial-crash-was-purely-a-banking-crisis-not-labour-overspend\" title=\"\">a banking crisis, pure and simple</a>\u201d. Gordon Brown was not responsible for the financial crises in the rest of Europe and the US.</p> <h2>8 Osborne\u2019s austerity</h2> <p>2010-16<br>Thanks to an enormous fiscal and monetary stimulus, the British economy was recovering nicely by the summer of 2010. But the coalition government, making absurd comparisons with the seriously troubled Greek economy, caused the incipient recovery to stall by removing the fiscal stimulus and embarking on a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/01/austerity-over-george-osborne-toxic-legacy-tories-cuts\" title=\"\"> prolonged period of austerity</a>. This is still with us, and its impact has been deleterious.</p> <p>Not only were public investment plans cut back: business confidence was shaken, and the industrial investment required for normal growth was much reduced, affecting the economy\u2019s underlying productivity. Moreover, George Osborne made no secret of the fact that he was using austerity in a deliberate, doctrinal bid to reduce the size of the public sector.</p> <h2>9 Referendum and Brexit <br></h2> <p>2016<br>It is well known that David Cameron thought that, by resorting to a referendum, he could resolve the decades-old fissure within the Conservative party over \u201cEurope\u201d. Instead he has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/29/what-blame-brexit-misfortune-blame-david-cameron-hubris\" title=\"\">aggravated these splits</a>, as we see daily.</p> <p>I am still hoping that, at the 11th hour, the country will come to its senses. The oil crises of the 1970s severely aggravated our economic problems, but they were external shocks. This crisis is self-inflicted. </p> <p>\u2022 Nine Crises by William Keegan is published by Biteback, \u00a320</p>",

At Wimbledon College I produced an underground (handwritten) newspaper and dabbled in undergraduate journalism at Cambridge in the early 1960s. In those days, although I read economics \u2013 because I wanted to understand politics \u2013 I had no idea that I would take up economic journalism as a career. But the field began to narrow when I heard the Financial Times took one or two recruits straight from university. The scales were removed from my eyes during an interview with Sir Gordon Newton, the FT\u2019s then editor, when I was firmly told that the cuttings of which I was most proud were \u201cnot up to it\u201d \u2013 but there was one that suggested I had potential as an FT reporter. From then I never looked back, and in 1977 I joined the Observer, first as economics correspondent, then as economics editor. One interesting change I have noticed is the way that economic and business coverage is much more prominent, not to say all-pervasive, than it used to be. When I came into economic journalism one had to work hard and win people\u2019s trust in order to gain background information, let alone a \u201cquote\u201d. But one gets the impression these days that people are vying to let the world know what they think \u2013 not least in their much-publicised tweets. In terms of the recurring themes over the period covered by these nine crises, I find two that stand out. One is the constant search by British policymakers for an economic panacea, and the second is the way that certain obsessions take over in the coverage of economics. In the 1960s and 70s the obsession was with the overseas trade figures and the balance of payments; nowadays these hardly get a mention, even though the underlying position is much worse than it was then. The modern obsession is with the budget deficit, which received precious little attention in earlier decades. And, of course, the 2016 referendum and prospect of Brexit have, for good reasons, taken over as the main focus of economic news. Welcome to the ninth of my crises\u2026 and to the eight that preceded it. 1 Devaluation 1967 In November 1967 the Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, took the decision to devalue the pound by 14.3%. He had resisted devaluation for three years, against official advice that it would restore export competitiveness, but in the end it was forced upon him by the markets. Wilson, trying to get across to the public that it was the price of imports that would be significantly hit, rather than people\u2019s total spending power, was nevertheless widely mocked for saying that \u201cthe pound in your pocket has not been devalued\u201d. 2 The oil crisis and the three-day week 1973 The Conservative government under Edward Heath \u2013 1970-74 \u2013 tried to take on the unions by restricting their power \u2013 but it failed. Heath\u2019s mistake was not to recognise that the market power of the miners had been dramatically increased by the impact of the oil-exporting countries (Opec), which had quintupled the price of oil in the autumn of 1973. A miners\u2019 strike provoked disruption to electricity supplies and the nation was put briefly on a three-day week. Heath held an election on \u201cwho governs?\u201d\u2026 and lost. 3 The IMF crisis 1976 Once again a Labour government was returned with all manner of good intentions, but bedevilled by \u201cevents\u201d. It inherited an \u201cinflationary spiral\u201d. In one of the worst-timed but best-intended economic policy moves of the post-1945 era, the Heath government had linked wage increases to the cost of living on the eve of the oil shock. The government, by this time led by James Callaghan, had, in a popular phrase, \u201cto go cap in hand\u201d to the International Monetary Fund in humiliating circumstances. 4 Thatcher recession 1979-82 The Thatcher government came in having adopted the monetarist doctrines of Professor Milton Friedman. The message was that all they needed to do to control inflation was to control the money supply. This proved a false god, and many years later monetarism was disowned by Friedman himself. But having promised to control inflation, the Thatcher government saw a rise in the rate from an inherited 10% to more than 20% a year later. Britain experienced its worst recession since the 1930s, and the pain inflicted on society and manufacturing was such that unemployment went on rising to more than 3 million by 1986. 5 Lawson boom-and-bust and Thatcher 1983-89 Nigel Lawson, chancellor 1983-89, was at heart an expansionist. He produced an expansionary budget in 1988, in the middle of a campaign to persuade Thatcher that the answer to Britain\u2019s endemic inflation problem was to emulate the far more successful Germans. He failed to persuade Thatcher to put the pound into the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) but instructed the Bank of England to \u201cshadow the deutschmark\u201d. It all ended in tears when Thatcher found out, and the last straw for Lawson was the reappearance on the scene of Thatcher\u2019s economic adviser Sir Alan Walters, which provoked him to resign. 6 Black Wednesday 1992 The Lawson boom led to another splurge in inflation, with the annualised rate of increase peaking at 10.9% in the autumn of 1990. By this time John Major had been chancellor for a year and, along with the rest of the establishment, had worn Thatcher\u2019s resistance down. The pound was put into the ERM. This was the worst possible time to hook the pound to what was in effect a deutschmark zone, because the good news about German reunification in 1989 was soon followed by the bad news of the impact of unification on German inflation. It took the second-worst recession \u2013 1990-92 \u2013 since the 1930s to bring UK inflation down again. The need to keep the pound in the ERM involved cripplingly high interest rates. Finally, by 16 September 1992, the policy was seen to be unsustainable and the Bank of England spent most of its currency reserves in a vain attempt to prop up the pound. 7 Financial crash 2007-2009 By 2007, policymakers believed that, with the aid of the latest panacea, \u201cinflation targeting\u201d \u2013 entrusted to an independent Bank of England in 1997 \u2013 they had found the economic philosopher\u2019s stone. Alas, in Britain and elsewhere, they took their eyes off the \u201cfinancial stability\u201d ball. The crash a decade ago was, in the words of Nicholas Macpherson, Treasury permanent secretary under both Labour and the Conservatives, \u201ca banking crisis, pure and simple\u201d. Gordon Brown was not responsible for the financial crises in the rest of Europe and the US. 8 Osborne\u2019s austerity 2010-16 Thanks to an enormous fiscal and monetary stimulus, the British economy was recovering nicely by the summer of 2010. But the coalition government, making absurd comparisons with the seriously troubled Greek economy, caused the incipient recovery to stall by removing the fiscal stimulus and embarking on a prolonged period of austerity. This is still with us, and its impact has been deleterious. Not only were public investment plans cut back: business confidence was shaken, and the industrial investment required for normal growth was much reduced, affecting the economy\u2019s underlying productivity. Moreover, George Osborne made no secret of the fact that he was using austerity in a deliberate, doctrinal bid to reduce the size of the public sector. 9 Referendum and Brexit 2016 It is well known that David Cameron thought that, by resorting to a referendum, he could resolve the decades-old fissure within the Conservative party over \u201cEurope\u201d. Instead he has aggravated these splits, as we see daily. I am still hoping that, at the 11th hour, the country will come to its senses. The oil crises of the 1970s severely aggravated our economic problems, but they were external shocks. This crisis is self-inflicted. \u2022 Nine Crises by William Keegan is published by Biteback, \u00a320",

      "body": "<p>For people working in the outwardly bright and cheerful world of children\u2019s television, the past week was not a happy one.</p> <p>On Thursday, a report on the UK\u2019s television viewing habits confirmed many of their worst fears. Among 4-to-15-year-olds last year, the hours of conventional or \u201clinear\u201d television viewed \u2013 that is, television watched at the time it was being broadcast \u2013 had fallen by 11% in 12 months. Among 16-to-24s, the decline was 15%: the biggest year-on-year drop ever recorded.</p> <p>The figures mean that British under-25s are now watching exactly half the amount of conventional broadcast television that they did in 2010 \u2013 when, according to the report\u2019s authors, the industry felt the first real impact of streaming services, YouTube, and tablet computers. Broadly speaking, 4-to-15-year-olds are defecting to YouTube, and 16-to-24-year-olds to streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.</p> <p>YouTube, says Julian Aquilina of Enders Analysis, the publisher of the report, looks like the big winner. \u201cThe under-16s on average spend two and a half hours a day watching some form of TV or video, and YouTube gets 45 minutes of that \u2013 a very large proportion for a single channel.\u201d</p> <p>The big losers, meanwhile, are the conventional broadcasters, forced to watch a glorious past of <em>Blue Peter</em>, <em>Grange Hill</em> and <em>Peppa Pig</em> succumb to digital celebrities such as ThatcherJoe, Zoella and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/05/whats-up-pewdiepie-the-troubling-content-of-youtubes-biggest-star\" title=\"\">PewDiePie</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that our television broadcasters are concerned,\u201d Aquilina said. \u201cTheir real worry is that their future adult audiences used to be trained up on their children\u2019s channels, and that seems to be ending.\u201d</p> <p>One senior drama producer, who has worked at BBC1 and the commercial channels, puts it more bluntly. \u201cStreaming channels, and even more so YouTube, are cooler, edgier, and do all the things mainstream TV cannot do \u2013 simply because their economic models means they don\u2019t have to reach nearly as many viewers, and they\u2019re not policed by the <em>Daily Mail</em>. Young people go to Netflix or YouTubers because those channels feel like they\u2019re directly targeting them.</p> <p>\u201cI look at the new Netflix series<em> </em><em>Sex Education</em>, or at kids like PewDiePie being frank about their lives on YouTube, and I think: \u2018If I was making <em>Hollyoaks</em>, I\u2019d shit myself.\u2019 And you can\u2019t copy it, so what do you do to attract that audience? How do you reach it for an advertiser? You can try to collaborate, but what we all really need are new ideas.\u201d</p> <p>As Enders was announcing its report in central London, a home for some of those new ideas was being prepared at the ExCeL exhibition centre, a few miles away in Docklands. From Thursday to Sunday next week, the ExCeL will host the first UK staging of VidCon, the world\u2019s best-attended and best-known event for YouTubers and the industry that now surrounds them.</p> <p>The new breed of celebrities known as YouTubers seek to gain subscribers to their YouTube channels by regularly posting videos \u2013 usually featuring themselves. Through advertising, brand endorsements and their own branded products, they can make substantial fortunes. The world\u2019s most popular YouTuber, Felix Kjellberg \u2013 a 29-year-old Swede known to his fans as PewDiePie \u2013 has 84.3 million subscribers and in 2016 was reported by <em>Forbes</em> magazine to be earning $15m a year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"944b0aa9c4cfa4e157ad39ac4d553b7adba0fbc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/944b0aa9c4cfa4e157ad39ac4d553b7adba0fbc0/0_0_2464_1478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube star PewDiePie (Felix Kjellberg) poses for a selfie with a fan in Singapore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">YouTube star PewDiePie (Felix Kjellberg) poses for a selfie with a fan in Singapore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roslan Rahman/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was two other successful YouTubers, brothers Hank and John Green (John is also the bestselling author of the novel <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em>) who created VidCon in 2010.

In December, PewDiePie was caught out publicising a fellow YouTuber who had posted videos with antisemitic content, and Netflix\u2019s documentary <em>Fyre</em>, released last month, discredited social media influencers such as the model Kendall Jenner who helped to publicise the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/dec/20/fyre-festival-i-paid-4000-to-go-its-fair-game-to-make-fun-of-me\" title=\"\">disastrous Fyre festival in 2017</a>.</p> <p>James Hacking, founder of the agency Socially Powerful, which brokers relationships between YouTubers, influencers and brands, says the answer lies in understanding what makes a someone successful, rather than judging them on their number of followers.</p> <p>\u201cBrands need to understand,\u201d he says, \u201cwho the people are who actually have real influence over their audience \u2013 who can actually make their audience move, react, click, buy, attend events and so on. You can\u2019t tell that just from the numbers of followers. Brands need to build long-term relationships with these influencers.\u201d</p> <p>What young audiences are really looking for is authenticity, he says. \u201cYou can tell when people have got into the career to make a lot of money, because it comes across in their content and how they portray themselves. They maybe start to put less effort into what they\u2019re creating, working with too many brands, or simply just uploading content for the sake of it. If you\u2019re authentic and stay true to yourself, you\u2019ll evolve and perhaps grow up, but you\u2019ll always be the same person who your audience want to watch and engage with.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, Hacking can detect signs of inauthenticity because he is of the generation that can read the signs; the rest of us must ask a helpful child, or resort to talks at the ExCeL centre.</p> <p>It is tempting, perhaps, to think that all this means we are living through the final days of children\u2019s television\u2019s golden age. But from the children\u2019s point of view, perhaps we are just at the beginning of a new one; it\u2019s just that, if you\u2019re over 24, you\u2019re not really invited in. </p>",

It was two other successful YouTubers, brothers Hank and John Green (John is also the bestselling author of the novel The Fault in Our Stars) who created VidCon in 2010. An annual event in southern California, it combines thronged guest appearances by YouTube celebrities with earnest talks by stars, thinkers and executives from film, TV and technology. It might seem a curious blend of YouTube, Glastonbury and the Edinburgh international television festival, but it sells out its 30,000 tickets weeks before opening, and is widely regarded as the best place to observe the future of online video culture. VidCon\u2019s chief executive, Jim Louderback, says the event is coming to London because the UK is \u201cthe biggest online video audience in Europe, and one of the biggest English-speaking markets in the world\u201d, and because it \u201chas an amazing group of local creators\u201d.

Louderback says: \u201cBack in 2010, online video was widely perceived as an outlier, a backwater of viral videos and user generated content, but we were sure that this was to become a large part of the future of entertainment: but the world of traditional video \u2013 television and movies \u2013 and the world of online video were separated by a huge gulf.

Most YouTube channels are viewed by children on their own, with the YouTuber speaking directly to camera, and a great deal of the content involves riffing on the mundane details of daily life. American YouTuber Robert James Rallison\u2019s animated channel, The Odd1sOut, features lengthy monologues about subjects such as working in Subway or disliking board games; it has 10 million subscribers. This appetite for banality now divides generations in the way that raucous music used to. Parents who grew up with punk may be proudly unshockable when it comes to their kids\u2019 Spotify playlists, but don\u2019t understand why anyone would listen to hour-long discourses on what someone just bought at the mall. The programme-makers among them do, however, understand that the sense of intimacy created in such videos just doesn\u2019t work on a 48-inch TV in the living room. One apparently obvious solution for programme-makers and brands is to partner with YouTubers, who can be slotted into TV formats as characters or contestants \u2013 hence the appearance of ThatcherJoe (Joe Sugg) on last year\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing. Even that strategy \u2013 the subject of several talks at VidCon \u2013 has come into question, though, because of recent controversies involving social media stars. In December, PewDiePie was caught out publicising a fellow YouTuber who had posted videos with antisemitic content, and Netflix\u2019s documentary Fyre, released last month, discredited social media influencers such as the model Kendall Jenner who helped to publicise the disastrous Fyre festival in 2017. James Hacking, founder of the agency Socially Powerful, which brokers relationships between YouTubers, influencers and brands, says the answer lies in understanding what makes a someone successful, rather than judging them on their number of followers. \u201cBrands need to understand,\u201d he says, \u201cwho the people are who actually have real influence over their audience \u2013 who can actually make their audience move, react, click, buy, attend events and so on. You can\u2019t tell that just from the numbers of followers. Brands need to build long-term relationships with these influencers.\u201d What young audiences are really looking for is authenticity, he says. \u201cYou can tell when people have got into the career to make a lot of money, because it comes across in their content and how they portray themselves. They maybe start to put less effort into what they\u2019re creating, working with too many brands, or simply just uploading content for the sake of it. If you\u2019re authentic and stay true to yourself, you\u2019ll evolve and perhaps grow up, but you\u2019ll always be the same person who your audience want to watch and engage with.\u201d Of course, Hacking can detect signs of inauthenticity because he is of the generation that can read the signs; the rest of us must ask a helpful child, or resort to talks at the ExCeL centre. It is tempting, perhaps, to think that all this means we are living through the final days of children\u2019s television\u2019s golden age. But from the children\u2019s point of view, perhaps we are just at the beginning of a new one; it\u2019s just that, if you\u2019re over 24, you\u2019re not really invited in.",

Among those who have chosen to invest in the Netherlands are the Discovery Channel, Sony and Bloomberg. Sony announced last month it was moving its European headquarters to Amsterdam, as companies in the UK continue to progress with contingency plans.

Does anybody love anybody anyway?\u201d As both these authorities agree \u2013 not to mention those who maintain variously that it\u2019s a \u201cbattlefield\u201d, a \u201cdrug\u201d, a \u201cmany-splendored thing\u201d, or \u201ca stranger in an open car who\u2019ll tempt you in and drive you far away\u201d \u2013 love is a tricky concept to get a handle on.</p> <p>Here is a cheery, chatty book with a smile/wince-inducing play on words in the title and a slightly misleading subtitle, offering to make things clearer. Laura Mucha usefully tells us, for instance, that the ancient Greeks used no fewer than seven different words for love, one of which wasn\u2019t even Greek: <em>storge</em> (for the natural affection a parent feels for a child), <em>eros</em> (for romantic love), <em>ludus</em> (for playful affection between children or casual lovers), <em>philia</em> (for loving friendship), <em>pragma</em> (for \u201cmature love, including patience, tolerance and compromise\u201d), <em>philautia</em> (for self-love), and <em>agape</em> (for \u201cselfless, unconditional love that expects nothing in return\u201d).</p> <p>Those distinctions still seem to be serviceable, though of course they aren\u2019t absolute \u2013 and admit of further subdivisions. Among the themes that emerge in Mucha\u2019s discussion are the ease of mistaking lust for love (both, perhaps, being aspects of <em>eros</em>) \u2013 and of how relationships prosper in the long term when <em>eros</em> can be eased into a mixture of <em>pragma</em> and <em>philia</em> with, perhaps, a dash of <em>agape</em> stirred in. That is, once the sex goes and the noisy eating of soup becomes noticeable, kindness and companionate affection are what will keep you going. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/06/stevie-smith-steel-soul-of-suburbs-novel-on-yellow-paper\" title=\"\">Stevie Smith</a> put it: \u201cI am no longer passionate / But we can have some conversation before it is too late.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Mucha\u2019s subtitle is, as I say, is a little misleading. This isn\u2019t really a book of science, and Mucha isn\u2019t really a scientist (according to her website she \u201cworked as a face painter, studied flying trapeze, philosophy and psychology, and swam in Antarctica before becoming a lawyer at an international law firm\u201d). Her main selling point, for the purposes of this book, is that she is a fantastic nosy parker. As she represents it in her introduction, the bulk of original evidence in <em>Love Factually </em>comes from her lifelong habit of buttonholing complete strangers and asking them about their love lives.</p> <p>For a decade, she says, she \u201capproached hundreds of people in airports, shops, markets, cafes, restaurants, bars, hospitals, parks, galleries, libraries, museums, buses, trains, planes and ships.

If anyone told her to get stuffed and mind her own beeswax, she doesn\u2019t record it here.</p> <p>Her approach isn\u2019t systematic. She organises her material roughly by theme, including chapters dealing with infidelity, the difficulty of defining love, attachment theory (which yields some interesting and suggestive material; my \u201cavoidant style\u201d, I now think, is why my wife finds me so annoying), cultural expectations, long-term commitment, breakup and divorce, intimate partner violence and bereavement.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The bulk of original evidence comes from Mucha\u2019s habit of\u00a0buttonholing strangers and asking them about their love\u00a0lives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But Mucha has read and interviewed widely around the subject, too: her discussions are spiked with references to various social and psychological studies, bits of neuroscience and quotes from philosophers and psychologists living and dead.

      "body": "<p>Since finishing her latest novel, <em>Late in the Day</em><em>,</em> Tessa Hadley has been \u201cin a real panic\u201d. She was worried that the story \u2013 about two long-married couples whose seemingly well ordered, beautiful lives become messy after one of the husbands dies \u2013 was too sad, \u201ctoo glum\u201d. \u201cI thought it was going to be a disaster,\u201d she says. But the novel, her seventh, has just received early reviews from the US, including one in the Washington Post that begins by hailing her as \u201cone of the greatest stylists alive\u201d. We meet the evening before she heads off on a two-week US book tour. Many writers would grumble about this as a necessary evil of modern publishing, but Hadley is looking forward to it, especially her shared events with the Irish writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/30/colm-toibin-interview-brooklyn-brexit\" title=\"\">Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn</a>, \u201ca genius\u201d, and the New Yorker critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/02/james-wood-interview-upstate\" title=\"\">James Wood</a>. The whole thing is \u201camazing\u201d, she marvels. </p> <p>Success is all the more gratifying to Hadley \u201cbecause it came later\u201d. After 20 years of struggling to write, <em>Accidents in the Home</em>, her first novel, was published when she was 46. Much has been made of this late start but, as she points out, it\u2019s hardly as if she were Penelope Fitzgerald (who was 61 when her first novel was published). In a long print dress and waistcoat, and with her fine bone structure and expressive manner, Hadley, now in her 60s, could be the elegant, sharply drawn heroine of one of her own books (she is not, she insists, the quietly determined painter Christine in <em>Late in the Day</em>, \u201cbut I felt very close to her\u201d). She speaks with the flowing, thoughtful intensity of her prose, and says of the impending tour: \u201cI\u2019ve had my moments of thinking \u2018wouldn\u2019t it have been fun to do this in my 30s? Wouldn\u2019t it have been <em>wicked</em> to do this in my 30s!\u2019 But then I wouldn\u2019t change those strange, anonymous, quiet, private years of feeling quite low sometimes because I so longed to write and I couldn\u2019t do it. Feeling like a real person, with friends and family, I wouldn\u2019t lose that, that seems part of everything to me. And,\u201d she reflects, sinking back into the armchair with her glass of wine, \u201cwhat a nice compensation for growing older. I\u2019m so lucky.\u201d</p> <p>Reviews of Hadley\u2019s work tend to sound like undergraduate reading lists, comparing her to everyone from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/15/elizabeth-bowen-author-fiction\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Bowen</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/virginiawoolf\" title=\"\">Virginia Woolf</a>. She has a theory that if you mention writers you admire in interviews, your work becomes associated with them, and she is full of recommendations (it\u2019s not often Polish poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/31/zbigniew-herbert-polish-poet\" title=\"\">Zbigniew Herbert</a> comes up in conversation). She is yet to win one of the big literary prizes, perhaps because she is known for \u201cdomestic fiction\u201d and is often seen as Britain\u2019s answer to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/10/alice-munro-wins-nobel-prize-in-literature\" title=\"\">Alice Munro</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/14/anne-tyler-the-clock-dance-interview\" title=\"\">Anne Tyler</a>. <em>Late in the Day</em>, with its focus on the enduring conflicts between marriage and freedom (infidelity), motherhood and art, is hallmark Hadley, although, with its serious, questing characters, it is in some ways more akin to the now rather unfashionable novels of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/feb/10/iris-murdoch-sea-booker\" title=\"\">Iris Murdoch</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/18/margaret-drabble-books-that-made-me\" title=\"\">Margaret Drabble</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Her characters are burdened by conscience and privilege, angsty and guilt-ridden, but impotent to do anything about it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With this book, she wanted to write about long marriages, in particular, because \u201cthey seem immensely interesting and they are kind of new in a way \u2026 people just live so much longer.\u201d She recalls an image from a folktale that appears in the novel of holding on to your lover as he goes through a series of metamorphoses: a fairy, a dragon, a lion. \u201cAnd it seems to me marriage is a bit like that,\u201d she says. \u201cYou either hang on or you don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Hanging on or not is the starting point for much of Hadley\u2019s fiction and she is good on the nagging insistence of desire. \u201cYeah, I am always writing about the power of that, not in detail, but what a potent thing it is, and yet how hard it still is to talk about.\u201d The sex life of one of the couples in the book, Christine and Alex, \u201cis non-existent and quite inarticulate. You read all those wonderful Guardian advice columns, saying: \u2018You must talk to each other\u2019 and they aren\u2019t and actually they can\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s something about cohabiting that is a little bit numbing. I have a perfectly happy marriage,\u201d she adds, laughing.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/06/anne-enright-books-that-made-me\" title=\"\">Anne Enright</a> noted years ago, \u201cHadley, for all the felicity of her prose style, is an immensely subversive writer.\u201d But, set in the comfortable, self\u2011conscious world of London art dealers, artists and poets, <em>Late in the Day</em> hardly seems radical. In fact, in subject matter, tone and location, it could be described as a Hampstead novel for Fitbit-wearing fiftysomethings.</p> <p>Apart from passing mentions of Facebook or Tinder, her fiction has an Austen-like reticence about external events. But Hadley, like her well-meaning, well-heeled characters, is acutely aware of \u201cthis dangerous globalised world\u201d, reading and worrying about it all the time, wondering: \u201cWhat am I doing wasting my time on this, when the world is going to hell in a handcart?\u201d</p> <p>Her characters, like Chekhov\u2019s, she says, are burdened by conscience and privilege, angsty and guilt-ridden, but impotent to do anything about it. \u201cAll a novelist can do is watch the people thinking that.\u201d But instead of the largely upper middle-class groups of the north London novels of yore, she is interested in the overlooked \u201cmuch-mocked, Guardian-reading liberal intelligentsia, who are so characteristic of now, with all their comedy and all their sweetness and goodness\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIs it drawing to a close, do you think? Our bourgeois sensibility \u2026 Our privilege of subtlety and irony is at an end,\u201d one character laments, without irony.</p> <p>\u201cIt looks as if we have written about that for ever and ever,\u201d Hadley agrees. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t done a catch-up on quite how that feels now.\u201d This, she says, is her true subject: \u201cNot a huge one, but here in this little Britain, now. This class of conscientious, flawed, indulgent but self-searching people that is my generation. It is slightly tragic, no, comic, the helplessness of that conscientiousness,\u201d she says carefully. \u201cIt\u2019s a very conscientious moment I think.\u201d</p> <p>Hadley grew up in \u201ca very ordinary bourgeois schoolteacher\u2019s household in Bristol\u201d. But it was a creative one: her father was also a jazz trumpeter and her \u201cstay at home mum\u201d \u2013 \u201ca very beautiful, very sexy, very glamorous woman\u201d \u2013 was a dressmaker and artist, and her uncle is the playwright Peter Nichols (best known for <em>A Day in the Death of Joe Egg</em>). Although she was \u201cquite clever\u201d, she was \u201cno good at formal education\u201d, and hated her girls\u2019 grammar school in Bristol: \u201cIt was like a prison to me ... the most unhappy time of my life.\u201d At 14 she left to join her brother (now an art historian) at the local comprehensive, where she was much happier, and where an English teacher encouraged her to apply to Cambridge. \u201cDid I enjoy it?\u201d she asks herself. \u201cI felt a bit of a fish out of water.

      "bodyText": "Since finishing her latest novel, Late in the Day, Tessa Hadley has been \u201cin a real panic\u201d. She was worried that the story \u2013 about two long-married couples whose seemingly well ordered, beautiful lives become messy after one of the husbands dies \u2013 was too sad, \u201ctoo glum\u201d. \u201cI thought it was going to be a disaster,\u201d she says. But the novel, her seventh, has just received early reviews from the US, including one in the Washington Post that begins by hailing her as \u201cone of the greatest stylists alive\u201d. We meet the evening before she heads off on a two-week US book tour. Many writers would grumble about this as a necessary evil of modern publishing, but Hadley is looking forward to it, especially her shared events with the Irish writer Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, \u201ca genius\u201d, and the New Yorker critic James Wood. The whole thing is \u201camazing\u201d, she marvels. Success is all the more gratifying to Hadley \u201cbecause it came later\u201d. After 20 years of struggling to write, Accidents in the Home, her first novel, was published when she was 46. Much has been made of this late start but, as she points out, it\u2019s hardly as if she were Penelope Fitzgerald (who was 61 when her first novel was published). In a long print dress and waistcoat, and with her fine bone structure and expressive manner, Hadley, now in her 60s, could be the elegant, sharply drawn heroine of one of her own books (she is not, she insists, the quietly determined painter Christine in Late in the Day, \u201cbut I felt very close to her\u201d). She speaks with the flowing, thoughtful intensity of her prose, and says of the impending tour: \u201cI\u2019ve had my moments of thinking \u2018wouldn\u2019t it have been fun to do this in my 30s? Wouldn\u2019t it have been wicked to do this in my 30s!\u2019 But then I wouldn\u2019t change those strange, anonymous, quiet, private years of feeling quite low sometimes because I so longed to write and I couldn\u2019t do it. Feeling like a real person, with friends and family, I wouldn\u2019t lose that, that seems part of everything to me. And,\u201d she reflects, sinking back into the armchair with her glass of wine, \u201cwhat a nice compensation for growing older. I\u2019m so lucky.\u201d Reviews of Hadley\u2019s work tend to sound like undergraduate reading lists, comparing her to everyone from Elizabeth Bowen to Virginia Woolf. She has a theory that if you mention writers you admire in interviews, your work becomes associated with them, and she is full of recommendations (it\u2019s not often Polish poet Zbigniew Herbert comes up in conversation). She is yet to win one of the big literary prizes, perhaps because she is known for \u201cdomestic fiction\u201d and is often seen as Britain\u2019s answer to Alice Munro or Anne Tyler. Late in the Day, with its focus on the enduring conflicts between marriage and freedom (infidelity), motherhood and art, is hallmark Hadley, although, with its serious, questing characters, it is in some ways more akin to the now rather unfashionable novels of Iris Murdoch or Margaret Drabble. With this book, she wanted to write about long marriages, in particular, because \u201cthey seem immensely interesting and they are kind of new in a way \u2026 people just live so much longer.\u201d She recalls an image from a folktale that appears in the novel of holding on to your lover as he goes through a series of metamorphoses: a fairy, a dragon, a lion. \u201cAnd it seems to me marriage is a bit like that,\u201d she says. \u201cYou either hang on or you don\u2019t.\u201d Hanging on or not is the starting point for much of Hadley\u2019s fiction and she is good on the nagging insistence of desire. \u201cYeah, I am always writing about the power of that, not in detail, but what a potent thing it is, and yet how hard it still is to talk about.\u201d The sex life of one of the couples in the book, Christine and Alex, \u201cis non-existent and quite inarticulate. You read all those wonderful Guardian advice columns, saying: \u2018You must talk to each other\u2019 and they aren\u2019t and actually they can\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s something about cohabiting that is a little bit numbing. I have a perfectly happy marriage,\u201d she adds, laughing. As Anne Enright noted years ago, \u201cHadley, for all the felicity of her prose style, is an immensely subversive writer.\u201d But, set in the comfortable, self\u2011conscious world of London art dealers, artists and poets, Late in the Day hardly seems radical. In fact, in subject matter, tone and location, it could be described as a Hampstead novel for Fitbit-wearing fiftysomethings. Apart from passing mentions of Facebook or Tinder, her fiction has an Austen-like reticence about external events. But Hadley, like her well-meaning, well-heeled characters, is acutely aware of \u201cthis dangerous globalised world\u201d, reading and worrying about it all the time, wondering: \u201cWhat am I doing wasting my time on this, when the world is going to hell in a handcart?\u201d Her characters, like Chekhov\u2019s, she says, are burdened by conscience and privilege, angsty and guilt-ridden, but impotent to do anything about it. \u201cAll a novelist can do is watch the people thinking that.\u201d But instead of the largely upper middle-class groups of the north London novels of yore, she is interested in the overlooked \u201cmuch-mocked, Guardian-reading liberal intelligentsia, who are so characteristic of now, with all their comedy and all their sweetness and goodness\u201d. \u201cIs it drawing to a close, do you think? Our bourgeois sensibility \u2026 Our privilege of subtlety and irony is at an end,\u201d one character laments, without irony. \u201cIt looks as if we have written about that for ever and ever,\u201d Hadley agrees. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t done a catch-up on quite how that feels now.\u201d This, she says, is her true subject: \u201cNot a huge one, but here in this little Britain, now. This class of conscientious, flawed, indulgent but self-searching people that is my generation. It is slightly tragic, no, comic, the helplessness of that conscientiousness,\u201d she says carefully. \u201cIt\u2019s a very conscientious moment I think.\u201d Hadley grew up in \u201ca very ordinary bourgeois schoolteacher\u2019s household in Bristol\u201d. But it was a creative one: her father was also a jazz trumpeter and her \u201cstay at home mum\u201d \u2013 \u201ca very beautiful, very sexy, very glamorous woman\u201d \u2013 was a dressmaker and artist, and her uncle is the playwright Peter Nichols (best known for A Day in the Death of Joe Egg). Although she was \u201cquite clever\u201d, she was \u201cno good at formal education\u201d, and hated her girls\u2019 grammar school in Bristol: \u201cIt was like a prison to me ... the most unhappy time of my life.\u201d At 14 she left to join her brother (now an art historian) at the local comprehensive, where she was much happier, and where an English teacher encouraged her to apply to Cambridge. \u201cDid I enjoy it?\u201d she asks herself. \u201cI felt a bit of a fish out of water. It was a club again. I\u2019d been no good at Brownies. I longed to do ballet. I longed to fit in at grammar school, but somehow I\u2019m not good at it. It was fine at Cambridge. But no, I didn\u2019t love it.\u201d After Cambridge, she \u201chad no plan, except to live\u201d. She trained to become a teacher, meeting her future husband, her tutor Eric Hadley, and thereby fulfilling her mother\u2019s prophecy that she would \u201cmeet a lovely man, someone older, somebody in authority\u201d. And following a brief spell teaching (\u201cI was hopeless\u201d), she \u201cwent off and had babies \u2026 What madness. I blame DH Lawrence entirely.\u201d (She is an unashamedly passionate Lawrentian.) Over the next 10 years she had three sons, and three stepsons, who were \u201cintimately part of our huge family\u201d, and was \u201cbusy making a life at home and all of that, like my mother had done\u201d. But she was seized with a \u201cdevouring, painful need to write \u2026 pushed down with shame when I thought: \u2018How dare I think of it.\u2019\u201d Her fervent reading only increased her \u201chunger to do it\u201d. Once her boys were at school, she tried more seriously, \u201cin secret, not really making too much of it\u201d, finishing four novels. \u201cBut my books were no good. That was agony.\u201d She was \u201ctrying to write other people\u2019s books in other people\u2019s voices\u201d; Bertolt Brecht inspired one, Nadine Gordimer another, \u201cbut in all of them I was faking it in every sentence\u201d. She told herself to give up because it was making her so miserable, \u201cbut the trouble was, I couldn\u2019t\u201d.

She has taught creative writing there ever since: \u201ca joy to do\u201d.

      "bodyText": "And then, like that, there was no more sports. (Okay, lies: there\u2019s more sport. But my typing fingers hurt). In the A-League, City missed a chance to jump above finals rivals Adelaide, drawing 1-1, while in the battle of the cellar-dwellers it was the Wanderers who broke their 11-game winless run against the feckless Mariners. In AFLW, reigning premiers Western Bulldogs went 2/2 winning the Cats v Dogs derby, while earlier Collingwood were blown away by the hard-working Demons, who harried and hustled in midfield, and pounced with intent inside the 50. In the WNBL, premiers Canberra have won game one of the finals series against Adelaide with Kelsey Griffin bagging 22 points and 12 rebounds, while in the two NBL dead rubbers Cairns Taipans and the New Zealand Breakers picked up Ws. Perth\u2019s season finished on a low in the BBL as the Scorchers went down to the Strikers, while the Thunder just edged the Hurricanes in a rain-affected match in Sydney. And that\u2019s Saturday Sportwatch! Thanks for your company - join me tomorrow where football takes centre stage with two W-League semi finals and a top of the table clash in the A-League. And in the second of the Big Bash fixtures the Thunder have edged the top-of-the-table \u2018Canes in a rain-affected match, winning by four wickets with just a handful of balls to spare. Waiting to see if that\u2019s enough for a finals berth - my back of the envelope calculations suggest that Brisbane Heat will still hold fourth position on net run rate, thanks to the 10-over utter spanking they gave the Stars last night. A tough one for the Thunder, if so - winning a classic and moving level on points, only to still just miss out. The Stars with one final game tomorrow against the Sixers, and then we\u2019ll know our finalists. So it\u2019s honours even in the end. Either side with chance to win it, perhaps City the more deserving of the claim to a win, but for all their little moments of class it took a calamitous passage at the back for them to finally find the net. Plenty of young talent up front, but the challenge for Warren Joyce will now be to make them gel on the run in to the finals. Reds good value from their point, and they\u2019ll be the happier. They keep fourth place and prevent their rivals from hopping above them into a home finals berth. 90 + 3 min: Adelaide with a sustained spell of \u201ckeep-ball\u201d but as they look to play forward to Kitto City intercept and play forward with pace. Great scrambling from the Reds - they get as many as eight shirts back quickly. The fitness of both these sides has to be admired - they\u2019re playing this game at a terrific tempo. 90 min: Five minutes added on for the lengthy injury to Mileusnic. McGree with a clever turn to hoodwink Galloway, but he couldn\u2019t quite find a teammate and his cross just skims the back of the crossbar. 88 min: Both sides still attacking with pace, but a few heavy passes / moments of low quality undermining some otherwise impressive work from both teams. Wales and McGree combine in the final third, but the later is forced wide, and his tame shot is comfortably held by Izzo. 85 min: Vidosic with an interception, reading the pass from Elsey. He releases Wales, but the flying winger loses out to the Reds centre back who recovers well. Harrison with a sharp turn that takes two defenders out of the play, before releasing Riley McGree. Who is fouled by former City favourite Jakobsen. 82 min: A few sloppy touches coming into this one - this time it\u2019s Curtis Good with a heavy touch, and Blackwood is nearly through one-on-one from halfway, but Brattan recovers brilliantly to snuff out the chance! Maclaren makes way, it\u2019s Dario Vidosic who comes on. Handy old sub when you\u2019re chasing a goal late on. 79 min: Freekick, handy position for City. Fiercely whipped in from Brattan, and it\u2019s headed well clear from Blackwood. The Reds then look to break swiftly, but the new man Thomassen has a poor heavy touch, and the moment is lost. 77 min: Now a huge chance for Adelaide! A ball to the far post finds Goodwin, and instead of shooting the opening goalscorer crosses centrally for George Blackwood, but he can\u2019t generate the power, and it\u2019s gratefully clutched by Eugene Galekovic in the City goal! Big let off. 75 min: Wales and Jamieson combine well down the left, and the skipper looks to fire in a cross, but he can\u2019t clear the first line of defence. It comes down the left again, and this time the former Red, Jamieson, takes on the shot himself, off the right foot - but it blasts high and wide! It looked fierce, but it faded wide as it traveled. 71 min: This has suddenly all got a little nervy from the visitors, as Maclaren almost fashions a second! Isaias gets his foot on the ball in midfield, and the Spaniard tries to settle it down for his side. Goal! Melbourne City 1-1 Adelaide United (Maclaren) 68 min: Oh deary, deary me. They\u2019ve put themselves under so much pressure. They play out from the back and it all gets a little intricate from the Reds. Maclaren presses the \u2018keeper Izzo, whose cute dinked clearance is picked up by Brattan, who finds out wee Jamie completely unmarked, and he tucks the cross home with a backheel. Calamitous stuff from the Reds, Marco Kurz must be chewing wasps! 61 min: Substitute Ryan Kitto does well to earn his side a corner with a blistering run down the right, but again the City defence clears well. Melbourne then make the running, as Maclaren again drifts wide to find the ball. He combines well with Lachie Wales, who\u2019s looping effort is deflected behind. Better from City - they\u2019ve certainly got enough match-winners out there; but first they have to break through this resolute Reds defence. 56 min: Ooph. Harrison with the spectacular volley, but it sails just over the crossbar! It was a lovely cross from the left, well defended by Scott Galloway at the far post, but his header only found the young Brit lurking just outside the box. Better attacking stuff from the home side. 52 min: Maclaren drifts wide to pick up possession, you imagine the Reds will look to increasingly become more compact as the game goes on - but they\u2019ve not looked good chasing games this season, City. McGree strips his jacket and gets ready on the sideline. Can he make an impact? He replaces Berenguer. A-League - second half! 45 min: And we\u2019re back underway in our feature match. I wonder what choice words from Warren Joyce are ringing in his players\u2019 ears? There\u2019s some talk with his contract up in May that the Englishman could be fighting for his future, after what\u2019s been a mixed season with the high-spending club. Will his players respond in this 45? And it\u2019s two in a row for the reigning premiers, who having shot 5/5 across the first three quarters blotted their copybook with four behinds in the final quarter. To little avail though, as they kept the Cats scoreless in the last. They edge disposals, contested possessions and tackles but despite a fairly level contest in the middle of the park, they took the chances in front of the sticks. A good win, and they roll on, the Dogs. And an update from the WNBL where the Canberra Capitals have won Game I of the three-game finals series against the Adelaide Lightning. Here\u2019s the report from Australian Associated Press: The Canberra Capitals are one win away from claiming the WNBL championship after an 88-67 victory over the Adelaide Lightning. The Capitals overcame a fast start from the Lightning to strike the first blow in the best-of-three grand final series at AIS Arena on Saturday. Adelaide started promisingly by jumping out to an early 12-point lead but Kelsey Griffin and Marianna Tolo powered the Capitals to a 30-13 second term to wrest control away from the visitors. A two-time WNBL champion and grand final MVP with the Bendigo Spirit, Griffin inspired Canberra\u2019s first-half fightback on her way to a 22 point, 12 rebound performance. All five starters finished in double figures, Kia Nurse leading all scorers with 23 (5-of-10 three-pointers) with Tolo adding 14 as the Capitals extended their winning streak to 12 games. So, late drama in the opening half of an A-League match, for the second time today, as Craig Goodwin\u2019s header gives the Reds the lead. Harrison the pick of the new faces for City, but his namesake Harrison (Delbridge) getting turned inside out by Mileusnic; having already been fortunate not to concede a penalty against the Reds\u2019 flyer. Plenty of cut and thrust to this one. Big second half to come, as both these sides chase a top-four finish, and home final. Goal! Melbourne City 0-1 Adelaide United (Goodwin) 42 min: It\u2019s Mileusnic once again who causes havoc down the right, he\u2019s just got too much trickery and pace for Harrison Delbridge, and he whips in a perfect cross for the Reds\u2019 leading goalscorer. And he rises well, Goodwin, to nod home off the crossbar! A few minutes earlier it was Harrison again who almost was the X-factor for City, as his backheel put fellow debutant Maclaren through, but the Socceroo dragged his shot wide. How costly could that prove? AFLW three-quarter-time: Western Bulldogs 5.0 (30) lead Geelong 2.4 (14) So a carbon copy of the first quarter, at least on the board, as the Dogs notched 1.0 in reply to 1.2 from Geelong. They\u2019ve been enjoying more inside 50s, the Cats - they\u2019ve definitely had their opportunities but perhaps not finishing as clinically as the Dogs. Here\u2019s Georgia Clarke\u2019s long-range major: 35 min: Harrison with another handy contribution as he tees up Berenguer, but the Frenchman fluffs his shot. Of the three debutants he\u2019s looked the most lively so far, the young English striker. We haven\u2019t seen too much of Thomassen for the Reds yet. 31 min: Apparently not! A good patch this for the Reds, but against the run of play the ball breaks kindly for Harrison. He winds up a fierce shot - but it\u2019s blocked by Elsey. So no clear-cut chances, but both sides showing plenty about themselves. It\u2019s bubbling nicely as a contest, this one. 27 min: He\u2019s not making too many friends tonight, referee Peter Green, as he penalises Ritchie De Laet for a foul on Goodwin. That did appear harsh on the City man. Adelaide look to apply pressure of their own, but the City defence clears well. The Reds enjoying a good spell here, as Mileusnic tries to get past his man - he glides past Delbridge, then goes to ground inside the box! Was there a tug there? VAR may perhaps take a look. 22 min: A turnover from Adelaide but Jakobsen slides in to win it back - it looks to spark a dangerous counter, but the ref\u2019s pulled it up! He didn\u2019t like how the Dane slid in there, but, gee whiz, have Adelaide been hard done by there? They\u2019re both defensively minded coaches, so look for sharp transitions to be a feature tonight. 16 min: City enjoying the bulk of the early possession, probing down the flanks, as Harrison again draws a useful freekick. It\u2019s Luke Brattan with the delivery this time, but a foul in the box from an attacker ends the sequence\u2019s potential. 10 min: Back to the A-League, where it\u2019s been a lively first ten minutes. City\u2019s Harrison showing his pace to earn a freekick in a dangerous area. Berenguer with the delivery and it was Curtis Good who headed over, unmarked inside the six yard box! Adelaide with chances of their own, but it\u2019s the home side shading it so far, with their front third threat more apparent, now that they\u2019re no longer playing a right back at centre forward. AFLW half-time: Western Bulldogs 4.0 (24) lead Geelong 1.2 (8) So a big quarter for the hosts. As mentioned, Utri opened the scoring in the first half but it was three unanswered majors in a six-minute spree in that second quarter. Deanna Berry running clear of the defence before Bonnie Toogood fired home. Ellie Blackburn with a fourth, and it\u2019s a sixteen point game, after the hosts trailed by two at the first break. A-League Kick-off! So, we\u2019re underway in the late fixture between Melbourne City and Adelaide United, with both sides naming January signings up front for debuts. City with the youngster Shayon Harrison on-loan from Tottenham, the Reds naming on-loan Dutchman Jordy Thomassen up front. But, it\u2019s the first look at Jamie Maclaren - fresh from Asian Cup with the Socceroos duty - in a City shirt that is the real talking point. Can he start paying back the faith that\u2019s been placed in him, expected to inherit the mantle of star striker Bruno Fornaroli? AFLW quarter-time: Western Bulldogs 1.0 (6) trail Geelong 1.2 (8) Here\u2019s the opener for the Cats, before Aisling Utri notched the Dogs\u2019 first on the game: Now there is a late fixture in the AFLW, where Western Bulldogs play host to Geelong. We\u2019ll try and bring you intermittent score updates from that one, but we\u2019ll head across town to AAMI Park where it\u2019s a fixture that could determine who gets a home final in the A-League, as fifth-placed Melbourne City host fourth-placed Adelaide United. 90 + 6 min: Thar she blows! So, it\u2019s a first win in 11 for the under-pressure Marcus Babbel and his misfiring Wanderers. Mike Mulvey\u2019s Mariners now notch their ninth-straight loss on the road - joining the illustrious heights of the now-defunct New Zealand Knights. A fair result on the balance of play. Sotirio\u2019s slick counter attack seeing the home side win both halves, after Elrich\u2019s flukey cross gave them the lead just before half-time. Big headaches for the visitors; how do they turn their season around from here. 90 min: There\u2019s six minutes of additional time. They\u2019re huffing and puffing, the Mariners but without Simon they\u2019ve very much lost their focal point up front. At the very least they\u2019re missing their nuisance factor up front today. Duke looks to capitalise on a loose ball, but he\u2019s well marshalled by Aiden O\u2019Neill. I do feel for the 20-year-old, on loan from Premier League side Burnley. He\u2019s been one of the Mariners\u2019 best this season, but he\u2019s just not had enough teammates step up alongside him. 87 min: They\u2019re trying to muster a late rally, the Mariners but as Mallon and Sotirio come together it\u2019s a silly freekick conceded, and the Wanderers look to suck the momentum. Mitch Duke now looks to bustle his way past the Mariners backline, and the loose ball falls to Bonevacia who fires a fierce effort - but it whistles just past the post! 84 min: Mariners win a corner and look to build some pressure. It\u2019s a poor set piece though and the Wanderers defence steps in. But it\u2019s only partially cleared and Oar hangs up a tempting cross. Janjetovic beats the debutant Graham to it though, and clears the danger for the red and black. 80 min: Tommy Oar chargers through the centre, then tries a clipped effort from outside the box, but it\u2019s comfortably held by Vedran Janjetovic. He\u2019s almost as good as a new signing, the former Socceroo, given the injury-blighted season he\u2019s had, after joining amid such excitement in the same week as the now-departed Ross McCormack. Ah. Halycon days. Goal! Western Sydney Wanderers 2-0 Central Coast Mariners (Sotirio) 76 min: It\u2019s a fast break for the home side, and Roly Bonevacia rolls a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of Jaushua Sotirio. He times his run well, and rolls it calmly past Ben Kennedy in the Mariners goal. Now, any other teams in this league, you\u2019d say that\u2019s game over. But can the Wanderers contrive to give up the three points today? 75 min: Kye Rowles goes into the book for a heavy challenge from behind on Jordan O\u2019Doherty, just the second Mariner in the book, and forth player in all. It\u2019s not been a spiteful match, in fairness. It\u2019s feeling a little flat at the moment as the players head for a drinks break. It\u2019s hard inside Spotless Stadium, which, look. Isn\u2019t a great venue for football. Gee, they can\u2019t wait to get back to Parramatta Stadium, can they, the Wanderers? 70 min: And a bit of niggle from the home fans, as their marquee striker, Riera, makes his ways to the sideline to a chorus of a few boos, and he\u2019s replaced by Mitch Duke. The Spaniard hasn\u2019t scored since Boxing Day and did miss that sitter in the first half - and you might recall Duke, another January signing, scored within seconds of his return to the A-League last week. Can he repeat the medicine? And here\u2019s that \u201cfortuitous\u201d opener from just before half-time: 65 min: So an interesting patch of the game with momentum starting to swing towards the Mariners. Both these sides have squandered wins late on - on numerous occasions lately - so Wanderers\u2019 coach Marcus Babbel might have to tweak something to lift his side. It\u2019s Mariners who go to the bench, and it\u2019s another debut for a Sheffield United youngster, Stephen Mallon the man to come on, he replaces Millar. 60 min: It\u2019s two debutants for the Mariners, who bolstered their squad significantly in the January window. Youngster Sam Graham on loan from Sheffield United makes his debut at left wing back, while former Premier League player Jem Karacan lines up alongside Tom Hiariej in the centre of midfield. Andrew Hoole lines up a freekick from a handy area. You\u2019ll remember he hit two absolute belters last weekend (only for his side to lose 3-2 to Melbourne Victory). And, ooph! That one\u2019s not a million miles away either. Lovely strike. A-League: Second half! So, let\u2019s pick up the action from round 18, where it\u2019s 9th hosting 10th in the A-League. They\u2019ve not been bad in recent weeks, the Mariners, but they have thrown away some impressive leads. 24 games without a clean sheet for the Gosford club - so the problems aren\u2019t at the front. One bright spot for CCM this season has been Matt Millar, and the fullback wins his side a corner. We\u2019ll pick up the action here from the 55th minute. And in the first of two BBL clashes today, it\u2019s the Strikers who have got home over the Scorchers. Just four balls to spare, but in fairness they had it well under control for most of the innings, thanks to man of the match, Jonathan Wells, who smashed 69 (42). Calm work too from Harry Nielsen, who put on an 88-run partnership with Wells, before seeing his side home with 44* (29). Coulter-Nile matching his effort with bat with the ball, with 2-28, but the experienced heads of Marsh, Andrew Tye and Jason Behrendorff all going for over 10 an over. They finish the season last, the Scorchers - just wasn\u2019t the year in the West. A dramatic close to the opening half of our early A-League fixture, where the Wanderers have grabbed what could only be described as a \u201cfortuitous\u201d goal. Perhaps a freak goal? It\u2019s a cross from 35m out that\u2019s evaded everyone and snuck in at the far post, Tarek Elrich the unlikely scorer; and it\u2019s come just minutes after Oriel Riera managed one of the misses of the season. All of this happening in the shadow of half-time, in what had been until that point a rather tense, and terse encounter - but you\u2019d have to say, they\u2019re probably value for their lead the home side. And with just over four minutes to play, finally the home side has a major! Sarah Dargan with the \u2018double soccer\u2019 on a loose ball. Terrific skills, and she curls that one home between the posts. Chiocci then does well to hold on to one under tremendous pressure. She lines the set shot - can the Pies go back-to-back late on?! Nope. It drags wide, just the one point added. They\u2019re fighting to the final minute here though, the Pies. And a close up of Sharni Layton on the bench with a bloody towel on the schnoz. It hasn\u2019t been her day, with the Dees defenders swarming all over her. Melbourne chase one more - but the hooter beats them. An emphatic win in the end - they\u2019ve dominated almost every category, the Dees, and they run out deserved winners in the end. Final quarter, 7:30 to play: Tyla Hanks set up the opening goal of the game, and now she\u2019s got the chance to score her own, she lines it up from the Dees .. and it\u2019s there! What a pick up she\u2019s proving to be, the youngster - that\u2019s Melbourne\u2019s third of the game, and surely that\u2019s good night, nurse. Layton drops back to help out her side in defence, the Dees are swarming for a fourth, and the Magpies force one behind for another behind. Hanks hunts the ball again; surely not a second of the day?! She bangs a shot, but this time it drifts for a behind. And we\u2019ve had a crowd report: 7,228 here in at Victoria Park today. Tremendous crowd. It\u2019s amazing what the match-day experience is like at these perfect boutique stadiums (*coughs* A-League). AFLW final quarter - underway! Collingwood start brightly, as Chiocci looks to fires her chargers; but it\u2019s a terrific mark in traffic from Ainslie Kemp! If that goes to hand for black and white they\u2019re a certain at six, but no dice, says the Dees defender. Lambert with a terrific smoother on O\u2019Dea up the other end, you have to admire the performances of both defences today. AFLW three-quarter-time: Collingwood 0.2 (2) trail Melbourne 2.5 (17) 50m penalty for Lauren Pearce, but she doesn\u2019t realise the buzzer is so close and handballs off inside the fifty, and the Dees hurry a shot, but it fires wide. A bit of a let-off for the home fans - if she\u2019d settled for the set shot and plugged it they could have really put this game to bed. Can the Pies use that as a mini morale-boost? Fifteen minutes to salvage this one! Third quarter, 5:00 to play: Ruby Schleicher marks on her own defensive line, as the Dees look to bomb a massive major from near the 50. They\u2019ve added one behind, but the Pies remain scoreless since those early first-quarter minors. The intensity continues in midfield, with both sides scrapping fiercely. They\u2019ve struggled to hit their forwards, Collingwood, when they have gone long it\u2019s been too predictable or straight, and the Dees defenders have spoiled or marked well. Chiocci fights well to fashion another inside 50 for her side, but Melbourne smother the intended target. They\u2019re getting bodies everywhere, the Dees. AFLW third quarter - underway! Big defensive mark from Cunningham for the Dees to set the tone early on. Big 5-10 minutes for the Pies, they can\u2019t afford to go further behind, but if they start brightly here in this quarter then this big, vocal crowd could really bring them home. Kick-off: A-League - Western Sydney Wanderers v Central Coast Mariners Now, we\u2019ve got live A-League getting underway, as the Wanderers and Mariners go head to head. Surely somebody is going to notch a morale-boosting win today? They boast three wins from 34 this season between them, these two sides. Yikes. Bad news for Mariners fans, with news that Matt Simon is a late scratching. We\u2019ll bring you the key moments from that one, as we try and keep an eye on the AFLW as well. And a big surprise this afternoon from the NBL - they\u2019ve not been too flash this season, the Cairns Taipans, but they may have had a big effect on the finals makeup condemning the Brisbane Bullets to what\u2019s that, a fourth straight loss? Here\u2019s the report from Australian Associated Press: The Brisbane Bullets are now relying on results to go their way to make the NBL finals after a crushing 79-68 loss to the Cairns Taipans on Saturday. The Bullets must now beat the New Zealand Breakers in the final round and hope Adelaide loses to both Melbourne and Perth in order to sneak into fourth position. The Taipans, farewelling club champion and skipper Alex Loughton, led by as many as 15 points in the third term, but had to slog it out in the final quarter to win. Brisbane drew within two points at one stage and looked like overrunning the wooden spooners, but couldn\u2019t finish the job. Point-scoring machine Melo Trimble was kept relatively quiet, finishing with 23 points after a scoreless opening term. The retiring Loughton had 11 points in front of 5,000 adoring fans at a packed Cairns Convention Centre. He scored the match-winning points in the last minute of the game for a hero\u2019s reception. Great stuff Alex Loughton - always love it when a real servant of the game goes out in style. AFLW half-time: Collingwood 0.2 (2) trail Melbourne 2.4 (16) Big clearance from O\u2019Dea as Layton looked to win the ruck inside 50. Brazill with more terrific scrambling defence as the Dees looked to break quickly. There\u2019s been some phenomenal tackling today, neither side can get clear with the desperation on show. It\u2019s Dees working the handball combos better, and they\u2019re moving it better up the park, but again, it\u2019s defences on top. And finally, there\u2019s the first major of the game - with just 90 seconds to the hooter. And who else, Elise O\u2019Dea! A snapshot over the shoulder out of a crowded pack - 15 possessions for the half, she\u2019s running the show! Ooph. They were decent for 28 minutes, Collingwood, but in the shadow of half-time the Dees go back-to-back. Lauren Pearce no mistake from dead in front - Tyla Hanks with a terrific banana inside to find her. Great play, Dees! Second-quarter, 10:00 to play: Brazill and Chiocci working well at the back for the Pies - Melbourne enjoyed almost 2:1 inside 50s in that opening quarter, and they\u2019ve started on the back foot again in this quarter. But the final kick isn\u2019t quite sticking for the Dees. No change to the score, two behinds a piece. Quarter-time: Collingwood 0.2 (2) level with Melbourne 0.2 (2) So the Dees enjoying the lion\u2019s share of possessions with Lise O\u2019Dea leading the possession count, as the visitors harry and hurry in midfield. Neither side creating clear cut shooting opportunities in blustery conditions in Melbourne today. On Sharni-watch, there\u2019s been a few good leads, the odd handy tackle but nothing too much to get too excited about for Collingwood\u2019s big No 1. Expect this one to open up a bit more as the game goes on. First quarter, 5:00 to play: Huge mark by Lauren Butler under pressure, and she earns the 50m free with her marker infringing. A quick tap and she pumps long looking for Layton in the goal square.. but it\u2019s a terrific mark from the Dees defence. They\u2019re shading it in midfield the visitors, but they\u2019ve only managed to squeak two behinds. It\u2019s still very much cut and thrust at this stage. AFLW: Collingwood v Melbourne - first bounce! So Collingwood get going first in front of a terrific crowd packed in at Victoria Park. But it\u2019s the Dees that fashion the first shooting effort, but it skews across the face of the sticks and goes dead. And speaking of run chases - how\u2019s this for a knock from last night: 71* (30) and 81* (30) for an unbeaten opening stand of 158. Is that a record? Has the comp ever seen a shellacking like that from Bryant and Cutting? Hell of a knock. Melbourne Stars needing to pull themselves together ahead of their final game of the season; don\u2019t forget they can still sneak into the finals, at the expense of the Heat, if they can sink the Sixers tomorrow night. Hi! Thanks for joining us - we\u2019re not too far away from our first live feature match of the day from the AFLW, we\u2019re at Victoria Park in Abbotsford, the spiritual home of Collingwood, and our 22nd AFLW venue. It\u2019s Collingwood v Melbourne in that one. But first an update from the Big Bash League. A decent total from the Perth Scorchers, who have just finished their innings of 174-6 (20). Half centuries to Josh Inglis (55) and the much-maligned Mitch Marsh (50*) with Nathan Coulter-Niles belting a remarkable 25 off eight. Rashid Khan the pick of the bowlers for the Adelaide Strikers who start their run chase shortly. Andiamo. It\u2019s Saturday, which means it\u2019s Sportswatch. And with several competitions heading into finals season we\u2019ll try and whip round the grounds with matches from the Big Bash, NBL and WNBL all taking place. The main focus will be round two of the AFLW where it\u2019s Collingwood v Melbourne (*bonus feature alarm*: Sharni-watch) and Western Bulldog v Geelong. And also the A-League, where it\u2019s the battle of the cellar-dwellars Western Sydney Wanderers v Central Coast Mariners, and then two sides looking to cement their finals places as Melbourne City play host to Adelaide United. As always please join the conversation - fire us an email or tweet to enrich your fellow readers\u2019 afternoon/evening. Los gehts!",

Chestnut country once occupied some of the most spectacular wooded landscapes in the world, from the Shenandoah valley and the Catskills to Tennessee\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/1999/jul/31/lostmyheart\" title=\"\">Smoky mountains</a>. It is deep-gorge and clear-river country, where an understory of vibrant dogwood gives way to an imposing hemlock, a tulip tree or an exhilarating view. But something is amiss. When I visited last autumn, these woods would have been littered with fallen nuts from the magnificent American chestnut (<em>Castanea dentata)</em> \u2013 but for the blight that erased 4 billion trees from the landscape.</p> <p>Just under a century ago, the American chestnut disappeared from the vast eastern forests of the US.

      "bodyText": "If you move south through the US Appalachian region, between New York and Georgia, you get a feel for what Bill Bryson described in A Walk In The Woods as \u201cmile after endless mile of dark, deep, silent woods\u201d. Chestnut country once occupied some of the most spectacular wooded landscapes in the world, from the Shenandoah valley and the Catskills to Tennessee\u2019s Smoky mountains. It is deep-gorge and clear-river country, where an understory of vibrant dogwood gives way to an imposing hemlock, a tulip tree or an exhilarating view. But something is amiss. When I visited last autumn, these woods would have been littered with fallen nuts from the magnificent American chestnut (Castanea dentata) \u2013 but for the blight that erased 4 billion trees from the landscape. Just under a century ago, the American chestnut disappeared from the vast eastern forests of the US. A broadleaf of immense size and distribution, the chestnut suffered catastrophic decimation by the inadvertent introduction of an Asian blight, Cryphonectria parasitica. The blight arrived in 1904, on ornamental Japanese chestnut trees imported to furnish New York\u2019s expanding Bronx zoo.

There\u2019s a wonderful curving greenhouse that leans on an ancient wall. There are palms and lemon trees, fragments of time-worn statuary, an elegant wrought-iron table with a chair. On the table is a folded newspaper and a steaming espresso coffee, but no gardener visible. It\u2019s all a bit untidy and overgrown, enclosed by tawny walls capped with pan tiles, many apparently ready to slide off on to the artfully abandoned terracotta urns below. This is exactly what I expected and wanted from Tuscany: a place that looked carelessly civilised, and had been that way for a very long time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/florence_siena_map/giv-3902Et2KmL7d9rLk/\" data-alt=\"Tuscany\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/florence_siena_map/giv-3902Et2KmL7d9rLk/\">Tuscany</a> </figure>  <p>When I arrived the previous night at the <a href=\"https://www.loggiatodeiservitihotel.it/\" title=\"\">Hotel Loggiato dei Serviti</a>, I\u2019d asked the barman how old the building was. \u201cIt was built in 1492,\u201d he told me, \u201cthe year of Columbus.\u201d</p> <p>In that same year, local artist Leonardo da Vinci turned 40, while up-and-coming teenage rival Michelangelo was nursing a broken nose after a fight in the Carmine Chapel. The Florentine Renaissance was well under way, but the start of the wider European Renaissance is usually dated to 1519, the year of Leonardo\u2019s death and the birth of Catherine de\u2019 Medici (in Florence). That anniversary is the reason I\u2019ve come to walk between the city and its neighbour, Siena, the second one-time powerhouse of western civilisation. Can there be a better moment to trumpet the news that dark ages can give way to renaissance?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"963e09dd020c3f11d076c0a1f523c8531689d94e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/963e09dd020c3f11d076c0a1f523c8531689d94e/0_85_2942_1765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Florence\u2019s Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pleasure dome \u2026 Florence\u2019s Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Inntravel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After breakfast, a short taxi ride takes me to my starting point at Greve in Chianti \u2013 at first I walk past vineyards and olive groves but am soon in the forest. From a high point, I get an idea of what lies ahead: a landscape divided equally by forest and cultivation, the latter mostly in the valleys or lower slopes, the former cloaking ridges and rounded peaks. The paths are gravel tracks, rising and falling gently as I head south. Occasionally, a motor bike passes. Otherwise, I see no one. I\u2019m glad I filled my coffee flask before leaving Florence.</p> <p>It is much wilder than I\u2019d anticipated: deer tracks pepper the mud and the grassy forest glades have been roughed up by gangs of wild boar. I spot the print of a very large paw: dog or wolf? The Tuscan wolf has been making a comeback in recent years, but they are extremely shy. I pick up porcupine quills, too. Italy is the only European home to this animal, an introduction by the Romans, who liked to eat them. The porcupine, which grows to a whopping metre long, has taken revenge ever since by devouring the sangiovese grapes that make chianti wines.</p> <p>In the late afternoon, I climb the ridge atop which Radda in Chianti is sited and suddenly emerge in a gorgeous Tuscan town: narrow stone streets, tiny shops, and flourishes of ancient ornamentation in stone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1dada2bf6cf7ee034a48a96e9427324ed28045b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1dada2bf6cf7ee034a48a96e9427324ed28045b/0_276_4479_2687/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volpaia village\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heart of stone \u2026 Volpaia village, on the first day\u2019s walking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the far end, I find the <a href=\"https://www.vignale.it/en/\" title=\"\">Hotel Vignale</a>, home to a great restaurant, a sort of temple dedicated to the steak. Before dinner I swim in the unheated outdoor pool. \u201cAre you crazy? It\u2019s under 20 degrees!\u201d says Luigi, the dining room\u2019s high priest. Dinner arrives sizzling on a trolley and Luigi wields the knife. It is simply the best steak I\u2019ve ever tasted, although certainly not the cheapest. At the next table, Luigi gently persuades a pair of American visitors that ordering it \u201cwell done\u201d will not be a good idea.</p> <p>The next morning, I continue southwards. The vineyards are all fortified with hefty high barriers and electric fences. Five wolves were sighted three days ago, I\u2019m informed, but these defences are against deer and boar. I pass beautiful churches, all locked, and some farmhouses, but then enter an oak forest. Porcupine quills are scattered among the acorns and I can hear a deep grunting noise from up the valley. Porcupine party? Wild boar? I listen. Each episode of grunts is followed by a delicate rattling, like sticks clashing. The deer are fighting.</p> <p>I leave the path and creep up the hillside, weaving through dense thickets of coppiced trees. I spot a nose, a rump, a giant antler, a leg. The breeze is on my face. I go on all fours, inching my way forwards into a position behind a log where I crouch, unmoving, for a long time. The forest is so thick that I have yet to see an entire deer. Suddenly a big black male is charging through the trees towards me. I try to stand up, but my left leg has gone to sleep and I roll sideways. The big male thunders past. Has he seen me? Then I hear the rival somewhere down below. The big male pauses, breathing heavily, then sprints away downhill. The twenty-strong herd melts silently into the forest. My heart rate returns to normal and I hobble back to the footpath.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1212bd92a02c50d6de095249569e5b5f830e43c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1212bd92a02c50d6de095249569e5b5f830e43c1/0_275_4592_2756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vineyards around San Sano\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vineyards around San Sano.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This forest is the source of many Tuscan delicacies: white truffles \u2013 one of the rarest, most expensive fungi on the planet \u2013 and other specialities such as wild capers, asparagus, chicory and fennel. When I reach San Sano, the tiny village where I\u2019m staying, the owner of the <a href=\"http://sansanohotel.it/\" title=\"\">Hotel Residence</a>, Maurizio, fills me in on the wildlife with a communicative mixture of Italian, English and expressive gestures. \u201cThe <em>lupo</em> [wolf] is part of the <em>ecosistema</em> here, and we need them. There are so many <em>cervi</em> [deer].\u201d He mimes antlers. \u201cOne night, three of them jumped in my <em>piscina</em>.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder if the wolf had prompted this midnight swim?</p> <p>\u201cNo, the <em>lupi </em>never come to the village.\u201d</p> <p>He pours me a glass of chianti classico and I take it to the terrace of my ground floor room that opens out on a lovely garden and pool. The village is surrounded by vineyards and is totally peaceful. That evening, Maurizio serves me and a pair of his friends a typical Tuscan dinner in his cave of a dining room: bruschetta, bean soup, meat course and dessert, followed by \u201ca little grappa\u201d. It feels like I\u2019ve been absorbed into Tuscan family life. The hotel\u2019s dachshund trots in with a stick. Maurizio gestures despairingly: \u201cChloe!? How many times must I tell you?\u201d Chloe trots out, leaving the stick on the stone-flagged floor.</p> <p>Later, Maurizio shows me a book about the <em>palio</em>, the Siena horse race that dates back to medieval times, but our discussions are hampered because, after several glasses of chianti and the grappa, I can only speak a mongrel trade language stewed up from substandard Spanish, schoolboy French and half-witted Arabic. Not only that, Maurizio is forgetting his English. Chloe trots in with a stick. \u201c<em>Chloe! Quante volte devo dirti?</em>\u201d Chloe trots out.</p> <p>Next day, I reluctantly drag myself away from San Sano for the final section into Siena.

      "bodyText": "On the first morning, I lean out of my hotel window in Florence and admire the garden below. Whose can it be? There\u2019s a wonderful curving greenhouse that leans on an ancient wall. There are palms and lemon trees, fragments of time-worn statuary, an elegant wrought-iron table with a chair. On the table is a folded newspaper and a steaming espresso coffee, but no gardener visible. It\u2019s all a bit untidy and overgrown, enclosed by tawny walls capped with pan tiles, many apparently ready to slide off on to the artfully abandoned terracotta urns below. This is exactly what I expected and wanted from Tuscany: a place that looked carelessly civilised, and had been that way for a very long time. When I arrived the previous night at the Hotel Loggiato dei Serviti, I\u2019d asked the barman how old the building was. \u201cIt was built in 1492,\u201d he told me, \u201cthe year of Columbus.\u201d In that same year, local artist Leonardo da Vinci turned 40, while up-and-coming teenage rival Michelangelo was nursing a broken nose after a fight in the Carmine Chapel. The Florentine Renaissance was well under way, but the start of the wider European Renaissance is usually dated to 1519, the year of Leonardo\u2019s death and the birth of Catherine de\u2019 Medici (in Florence). That anniversary is the reason I\u2019ve come to walk between the city and its neighbour, Siena, the second one-time powerhouse of western civilisation. Can there be a better moment to trumpet the news that dark ages can give way to renaissance? After breakfast, a short taxi ride takes me to my starting point at Greve in Chianti \u2013 at first I walk past vineyards and olive groves but am soon in the forest. From a high point, I get an idea of what lies ahead: a landscape divided equally by forest and cultivation, the latter mostly in the valleys or lower slopes, the former cloaking ridges and rounded peaks. The paths are gravel tracks, rising and falling gently as I head south. Occasionally, a motor bike passes. Otherwise, I see no one. I\u2019m glad I filled my coffee flask before leaving Florence. It is much wilder than I\u2019d anticipated: deer tracks pepper the mud and the grassy forest glades have been roughed up by gangs of wild boar. I spot the print of a very large paw: dog or wolf? The Tuscan wolf has been making a comeback in recent years, but they are extremely shy. I pick up porcupine quills, too. Italy is the only European home to this animal, an introduction by the Romans, who liked to eat them. The porcupine, which grows to a whopping metre long, has taken revenge ever since by devouring the sangiovese grapes that make chianti wines. In the late afternoon, I climb the ridge atop which Radda in Chianti is sited and suddenly emerge in a gorgeous Tuscan town: narrow stone streets, tiny shops, and flourishes of ancient ornamentation in stone. At the far end, I find the Hotel Vignale, home to a great restaurant, a sort of temple dedicated to the steak. Before dinner I swim in the unheated outdoor pool. \u201cAre you crazy? It\u2019s under 20 degrees!\u201d says Luigi, the dining room\u2019s high priest. Dinner arrives sizzling on a trolley and Luigi wields the knife. It is simply the best steak I\u2019ve ever tasted, although certainly not the cheapest. At the next table, Luigi gently persuades a pair of American visitors that ordering it \u201cwell done\u201d will not be a good idea. The next morning, I continue southwards. The vineyards are all fortified with hefty high barriers and electric fences. Five wolves were sighted three days ago, I\u2019m informed, but these defences are against deer and boar. I pass beautiful churches, all locked, and some farmhouses, but then enter an oak forest. Porcupine quills are scattered among the acorns and I can hear a deep grunting noise from up the valley. Porcupine party? Wild boar? I listen. Each episode of grunts is followed by a delicate rattling, like sticks clashing. The deer are fighting. I leave the path and creep up the hillside, weaving through dense thickets of coppiced trees. I spot a nose, a rump, a giant antler, a leg. The breeze is on my face. I go on all fours, inching my way forwards into a position behind a log where I crouch, unmoving, for a long time. The forest is so thick that I have yet to see an entire deer. Suddenly a big black male is charging through the trees towards me. I try to stand up, but my left leg has gone to sleep and I roll sideways. The big male thunders past. Has he seen me? Then I hear the rival somewhere down below. The big male pauses, breathing heavily, then sprints away downhill. The twenty-strong herd melts silently into the forest. My heart rate returns to normal and I hobble back to the footpath. This forest is the source of many Tuscan delicacies: white truffles \u2013 one of the rarest, most expensive fungi on the planet \u2013 and other specialities such as wild capers, asparagus, chicory and fennel. When I reach San Sano, the tiny village where I\u2019m staying, the owner of the Hotel Residence, Maurizio, fills me in on the wildlife with a communicative mixture of Italian, English and expressive gestures. \u201cThe lupo [wolf] is part of the ecosistema here, and we need them. There are so many cervi [deer].\u201d He mimes antlers. \u201cOne night, three of them jumped in my piscina.\u201d I wonder if the wolf had prompted this midnight swim? \u201cNo, the lupi never come to the village.\u201d He pours me a glass of chianti classico and I take it to the terrace of my ground floor room that opens out on a lovely garden and pool. The village is surrounded by vineyards and is totally peaceful. That evening, Maurizio serves me and a pair of his friends a typical Tuscan dinner in his cave of a dining room: bruschetta, bean soup, meat course and dessert, followed by \u201ca little grappa\u201d. It feels like I\u2019ve been absorbed into Tuscan family life. The hotel\u2019s dachshund trots in with a stick. Maurizio gestures despairingly: \u201cChloe!? How many times must I tell you?\u201d Chloe trots out, leaving the stick on the stone-flagged floor. Later, Maurizio shows me a book about the palio, the Siena horse race that dates back to medieval times, but our discussions are hampered because, after several glasses of chianti and the grappa, I can only speak a mongrel trade language stewed up from substandard Spanish, schoolboy French and half-witted Arabic. Not only that, Maurizio is forgetting his English. Chloe trots in with a stick. \u201cChloe! Quante volte devo dirti?\u201d Chloe trots out. Next day, I reluctantly drag myself away from San Sano for the final section into Siena. Now the deep, silent forests are replaced with more vineyards, olive groves and graceful houses. I reach my hotel, the elegant Villa Scacciapensieri, but it is still a 3km walk to the centre. I decide to borrow a bike. It is a new bike, hardly used, and I soon discover why: Siena is built on several steep-sided hills that defy pedalling. Having said that, I do think a bike is a time-saver as the free-wheeling descents are rapid, and exhilarating. In the centre of the town, I come across huge crowds of people, everyone wearing a brightly coloured neckerchief and clutching a glass. I ask what\u2019s happening. \u201cIt\u2019s the palio,\u201d a man informs me. \u201cBut I thought it was only in July and August?\u201d I\u2019m here in October. The man grins. \u201cIt\u2019s a special one \u2013 to commemorate the end of the first world war. Most of us haven\u2019t even sobered up from August.\u201d Only now do I realise what Maurizio had been trying to tell me: the palio is on today. I can hear the roar of the crowd and, over heads, spot a blur of movement. The palio, I\u2019m sure, is worth seeing, but anyone without a ticket needs to be in position very early to get any kind of view. Later, as I explore the narrow streets, I hear the clip-clop of hooves on cobbles and a horse is led past me followed by a crowd of excited fans. In a small square, tables are laid out for a feast.

Pre-made bins are available for about \u00a365, but you can make your own from plastic storage bins or catering-sized food containers (10-litre mayonnaise bins and the like). Then all you need is some bedding, worms and food scraps. There are numerous online resources to take you through the process: one of the best I\u2019ve found is theurbanworm.co.uk. Once you\u2019ve got your bin, you need to acquire some worms. You cannot dig up earthworms from outside (they would hate to live in a bin); you need brandling or compost worms, which you can get online or from fishing-tackle shops, where you buy by weight. The rule of thumb is 200g of worms will eat 50-100 grams of food a day, but this may be less in cold weather. Worms like all sorts of things, but stay away from anything acidic such as citrus, onions, dairy and meat. They need a regular source of carbon to absorb moisture and act as bedding: you can use either coir or shredded paper, toilet rolls, corrugated cardboard (ripped up) and egg cartons. Worms are voracious eaters, but they have very small mouths. Allowing your kitchen scraps to partially break down in a caddy, or chopping their food first, will mean they can work faster for you.",

It was an act of both offense and defense: an attack through derision, and a kind of psychological defense against a deeply feared group.

These images sought to portray black people as clowns and freakish beings, exaggerating features so as to suggest the \u201cotherness\u201d of black bodies. In the 1830s, however, blackface took off in its most recognizable form today, when it was integrated into onstage performances by white Americans who donned dark makeup, red lips and rough curly wigs, the blackness of their makeup amplifying the whiteness of their eyes and teeth.</p> <p>The performances began in a number of north-eastern states. They often featured singing, dancing, skits and instrumental music, the latter often some form of \u201cNegro melodies\u201d. Blackface shows were marketed as a peculiar mix of high- and lowbrow entertainment; they were bawdy and crude, planting, in this way, the seed of vaudeville, but they also attempted to translate more elitist forms of art, such as opera, to a popular stage. The segregationist Jim Crow laws took their name from a minstrelsy act, <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/ap-explains-racist-history-of-blackface-began-in-the-1830s/\">Jumping Jim Crow</a>, by blackface showboat Thomas Dartmouth Rice \u2013 sometimes considered \u201cthe father\u201d of minstrel performance \u2013 who claimed it was based on a slave he knew.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a482b2573dc9f65f1f61f6c381dd96e20165617\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a482b2573dc9f65f1f61f6c381dd96e20165617/0_231_4141_2485/1000.jpg\" alt=\"year book\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Blackface occasionally appeared as a peculiar form of part-mocking homage.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So lucrative was blackface that even African American performers had little choice but to wear it if they desired a modicum of success with white audiences. Such was the case with <a href=\"https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/lane-william-henry-master-juba-1825-c-1852/\">one of the most famous black stage actors of the 19th century, William Henry Lane</a> \u2013 better known as \u201cMaster Juba\u201d \u2013 who was forced to wear blackface until he became sufficiently famous around the globe to travel, sans blackface, with a troupe of white actors. Lane astonished audiences, dancing a modified Irish jig and reel set to syncopated African rhythms, which laid the foundations for tap dancing. He was a prodigy, dancing in public from age 10 in the mid-1830s. Yet he had to humiliate himself in order to proceed; he had to, as a foundation, exist as a carnivalesque gag onstage, so that his white viewers might, after a hearty laugh and jeer, have a chance of noticing the extraordinary movements of his feet. In this way, blackface was a demeaning vehicle to success, a prerequisite for achieving posterity well into the early 20th century.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Blackface is the joke that comforts white Americans</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Blackface occasionally appeared as a peculiar form of part-mocking homage, and perhaps the clearest example of this is in a remarkable 1932 episode of Betty Boop, I\u2019ll Be Glad When You\u2019re Dead You Rascal You, which featured Louis Armstrong and his band. The cartoon begins with Armstrong and crew providing background music for Betty Boop, Bimbo and Koko the Clown\u2019s safari into a vast jungle; the troop is unceremoniously attacked by swarthy, grotesque-faced cannibals, who kidnap Betty Boop and prepare to cook her.</p> <p>In what must rank as one of the most blatantly racist scenes in popular cartoon history, the episode cuts to Betty Boop\u2019s sidekicks being chased by the floating head of an animated thick-lipped caricature indistinguishable from the iconography of minstrel shows, which morphs into Armstrong\u2019s own gigantic, floating face, then back into the cannibal\u2019s visage. To be sure, such racist imagery was common in early American cartoons, the origins of which are intimately tied to minstrelsy and vaudeville. Mickey Mouse, Bimbo and Koko may even be imagined as minstrels themselves, as the critic Nicholas Sammond has argued, their earliest onscreen performances often echoing the dance routines and musical numbers of minstrel shows. Against mounting criticism from civil rights groups, such blatant racism in public works steadily evanesced, fading, instead, into the background \u2013 no longer as obvious as Armstrong\u2019s transforming face, but still there, for those who looked.</p> <p>When a 1984 yearbook photo of Ralph Northam, the Democratic governor of Virginia, surfaced of a man in blackface and one in Ku Klux Klan robes, Northam claimed he did not remember being in the photo, but admitted he had darkened his face the same year to dress as Michael Jackson for a \u201cdance contest in San Antonio\u201d. It was a homage, he implied. \u201cIn the place and time where I grew up,\u201d <a href=\"https://qz.com/1540987/ralph-northam-faces-calls-to-resign-after-racist-photo-emerges/\">Northam said</a> during a press conference, \u201cmany actions that we rightfully recognize as abhorrent today were commonplace.\u201d Northam seemed to believe that the \u201ccommonplace\u201d nature of racism absolved him \u2013 but, of course, it does not, cannot. Incredibly, the Virginia attorney general soon revealed that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/us/politics/virginia-blackface-mark-herring.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes\">he, too, had worn blackface</a> in the past. None of this was new in politics; the Missouri Democratic governor Mel Carnahan still won a 2000 Senate seat <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/keyraces2000/stories/carnahan102599.htm\">after a photograph surfaced of him singing in a blackface quartet</a>.</p> <p>The fact is that blackface has never left America; it has simply become less overt. It appears whenever other racist symbols do: the noose, the watermelon, the assumptions that black bodies are dangerous bodies, that one should cross the road when a black body walks towards you, day or night. It haunts us like some grotesque ghost, grinning and laughing, and hoping a certain kind of white audience still sees it, still laughs at it, still feels comforted, even, by it.</p> <p>It still appears in countless ways: the exaggerated features on Aunt Jemimah; the seemingly unending stream of <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/briannasacks/university-of-oklahoma-blackface-video\">college students caught on camera with faces painted black</a>; the minstrel-era features of Japanese anime and manga characters, <a href=\"http://www.dorkly.com/post/74898/i-wonder-where-censors-fall-in-the-pecking-order\"> such as Mr Popo</a>, who are popular in the United States; <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-15847986\">the caricatured effigies</a> of Barack Obama that conservatives have erected, year after year, to shoot, lynch or even detonate on camera. Blackface is a protean, all-encompassing form, indelibly interwoven into this country\u2019s psyche, its images of red lips suggesting both eroticism \u2013 harkening to colonial-era stereotypes, still extant, about the \u201cheightened\u201d sexuality of black bodies \u2013 and blood, the blood of the black corpses that fills America\u2019s soils. Its act still plays out on the stage of America today.</p> <p>Blackface is the joke that comforts white Americans who, consciously or otherwise, are terrified of nonwhite people, as Ellison knew. It lives on like a comfort food. The critic Elias Cannetti argued, in Crowds and Power, that laughter allows us to take power over the one we laugh at; perhaps this is why, even now, blackface still exists, a crude, cruel attempt by certain white Americans to retain a sense of racial superiority. Blackface is a ghost we may never be able to exorcise; it is too deeply, painfully American.</p> <ul> <li><p>Gabrielle Bellot is a staff writer for Literary Hub</p></li> </ul>",

The segregationist Jim Crow laws took their name from a minstrelsy act, Jumping Jim Crow, by blackface showboat Thomas Dartmouth Rice \u2013 sometimes considered \u201cthe father\u201d of minstrel performance \u2013 who claimed it was based on a slave he knew. So lucrative was blackface that even African American performers had little choice but to wear it if they desired a modicum of success with white audiences. Such was the case with one of the most famous black stage actors of the 19th century, William Henry Lane \u2013 better known as \u201cMaster Juba\u201d \u2013 who was forced to wear blackface until he became sufficiently famous around the globe to travel, sans blackface, with a troupe of white actors. Lane astonished audiences, dancing a modified Irish jig and reel set to syncopated African rhythms, which laid the foundations for tap dancing. He was a prodigy, dancing in public from age 10 in the mid-1830s. Yet he had to humiliate himself in order to proceed; he had to, as a foundation, exist as a carnivalesque gag onstage, so that his white viewers might, after a hearty laugh and jeer, have a chance of noticing the extraordinary movements of his feet. In this way, blackface was a demeaning vehicle to success, a prerequisite for achieving posterity well into the early 20th century. Blackface occasionally appeared as a peculiar form of part-mocking homage, and perhaps the clearest example of this is in a remarkable 1932 episode of Betty Boop, I\u2019ll Be Glad When You\u2019re Dead You Rascal You, which featured Louis Armstrong and his band. The cartoon begins with Armstrong and crew providing background music for Betty Boop, Bimbo and Koko the Clown\u2019s safari into a vast jungle; the troop is unceremoniously attacked by swarthy, grotesque-faced cannibals, who kidnap Betty Boop and prepare to cook her. In what must rank as one of the most blatantly racist scenes in popular cartoon history, the episode cuts to Betty Boop\u2019s sidekicks being chased by the floating head of an animated thick-lipped caricature indistinguishable from the iconography of minstrel shows, which morphs into Armstrong\u2019s own gigantic, floating face, then back into the cannibal\u2019s visage. To be sure, such racist imagery was common in early American cartoons, the origins of which are intimately tied to minstrelsy and vaudeville. Mickey Mouse, Bimbo and Koko may even be imagined as minstrels themselves, as the critic Nicholas Sammond has argued, their earliest onscreen performances often echoing the dance routines and musical numbers of minstrel shows. Against mounting criticism from civil rights groups, such blatant racism in public works steadily evanesced, fading, instead, into the background \u2013 no longer as obvious as Armstrong\u2019s transforming face, but still there, for those who looked. When a 1984 yearbook photo of Ralph Northam, the Democratic governor of Virginia, surfaced of a man in blackface and one in Ku Klux Klan robes, Northam claimed he did not remember being in the photo, but admitted he had darkened his face the same year to dress as Michael Jackson for a \u201cdance contest in San Antonio\u201d. It was a homage, he implied. \u201cIn the place and time where I grew up,\u201d Northam said during a press conference, \u201cmany actions that we rightfully recognize as abhorrent today were commonplace.\u201d Northam seemed to believe that the \u201ccommonplace\u201d nature of racism absolved him \u2013 but, of course, it does not, cannot. Incredibly, the Virginia attorney general soon revealed that he, too, had worn blackface in the past. None of this was new in politics; the Missouri Democratic governor Mel Carnahan still won a 2000 Senate seat after a photograph surfaced of him singing in a blackface quartet. The fact is that blackface has never left America; it has simply become less overt. It appears whenever other racist symbols do: the noose, the watermelon, the assumptions that black bodies are dangerous bodies, that one should cross the road when a black body walks towards you, day or night. It haunts us like some grotesque ghost, grinning and laughing, and hoping a certain kind of white audience still sees it, still laughs at it, still feels comforted, even, by it. It still appears in countless ways: the exaggerated features on Aunt Jemimah; the seemingly unending stream of college students caught on camera with faces painted black; the minstrel-era features of Japanese anime and manga characters, such as Mr Popo, who are popular in the United States; the caricatured effigies of Barack Obama that conservatives have erected, year after year, to shoot, lynch or even detonate on camera. Blackface is a protean, all-encompassing form, indelibly interwoven into this country\u2019s psyche, its images of red lips suggesting both eroticism \u2013 harkening to colonial-era stereotypes, still extant, about the \u201cheightened\u201d sexuality of black bodies \u2013 and blood, the blood of the black corpses that fills America\u2019s soils. Its act still plays out on the stage of America today. Blackface is the joke that comforts white Americans who, consciously or otherwise, are terrified of nonwhite people, as Ellison knew. It lives on like a comfort food. The critic Elias Cannetti argued, in Crowds and Power, that laughter allows us to take power over the one we laugh at; perhaps this is why, even now, blackface still exists, a crude, cruel attempt by certain white Americans to retain a sense of racial superiority. Blackface is a ghost we may never be able to exorcise; it is too deeply, painfully American. Gabrielle Bellot is a staff writer for Literary Hub",

      "bodyText": "On Tuesday night, the face of the Republican party was a wealthy 72-year-old white man from New York. The face of the Democratic party was a 45-year-old black woman from the deep south. After Donald Trump delivered the State of the Union address, Stacey Abrams offered her party\u2019s rebuttal. It is usually one of the more thankless tasks in American politics, blamed for nipping many a career in the bud. Abrams succeeded in turning it into an unofficial audition for future office. Governor of Georgia? US senator? Vice-president? President? All are potentially on the table, now or in the years to come. \u201cIt was an uplifting message of bringing people together,\u201d said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief public affairs officer at the progressive advocacy group MoveOn. \u201cIt was filled with hope and optimism. Having a woman of colour respond to Donald Trump is a powerful statement [or] rebuke of his policies and rhetoric. Giving a response is hard. Most failed. Stacey Abrams killed it.\u201d Jean-Pierre, a veteran of Barack Obama\u2019s election campaigns, added: \u201cDemocrats are not going to win by jumping in the mud with Donald Trump. We\u2019re going to win by offering up policies and a different vision for the country. She did that well. Her message was spot on. We are going to be seeing a lot more of her. She\u2019d be a strong candidate for any office. Where ever Stacey is going next, count me in.\u201d As the first African American woman to deliver the rebuttal, Abrams offered a vivid contrast from two years ago. Then, former Kentucky governor Steve Beshear, a grey-haired white man joined by mostly white people in a diner, gave the Democratic response to Trump\u2019s first address. Abrams spoke from a union hall in Atlanta, with a diverse audience including activists, educators and labour leaders. She dismissed the recent 35-day partial government shutdown as a \u201cstunt\u201d engineered by Trump. \u201cAmerica is made stronger by the presence of immigrants \u2013 not walls,\u201d she said. Abrams emerged as a rising star in last year\u2019s election for governor of Georgia, a Republican stronghold where she came agonisingly close to an upset. She eventually abandoned the race without a formal concession, asserting that her opponent, Brian Kemp, used his post as secretary of state to make it harder for people of colour to vote. She has since launched an effort to combat voter suppression, highlighted in Tuesday\u2019s address. Abrams also has compelling biography. One of six siblings who grew up in segregated Jim Crow Mississippi, she studied law at Yale and became a leader in the Georgia state legislature. She is also the award-winning author of eight romantic suspense novels, under the pen name Selena Montgomery, and tweeted this week that her favourite Doctor Who was Tom Baker. Soon after her rebuttal began, Dan Pfeiffer, the co-host of Pod Save America and former senior adviser to Obama, tweeted: \u201cStacey Abrams should run for President.\u201d A subsequent New York Times article was headlined: \u201cStacey Abrams Isn\u2019t Running for President. Should She Be?\u201d Some observers believe she deserves just as much hype as Beto O\u2019Rourke, who narrowly lost a Senate race in a red state, Texas, last November. There is no evidence to suggest Abrams will run, but Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is reportedly trying to persuade her to aim for Senate in 2020, sensing a chance to flip a Republican seat. Alternatively, she might wait for another chance to take on Kemp for governor, in 2022. Or she could become a formidable running mate for whoever emerges from the crowded Democratic field.

She has an affirmative personality. She tells a story rooted squarely in religion and tradition. She wasn\u2019t running against America in any way. She was firm but not angry.\u201d Long a \u201cred state\u201d, Georgia could become competitive in 2020 and Abrams could give Democrats an edge.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Grace Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Audrey Dalton, by Clive James</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/grace-kelly\" title=\"\">Grace Kelly</a>\u2019s career began as a 10-year cluster of roles for US television, but we didn\u2019t see those in Australia, so her first movies made a terrific impact. She arose out of nowhere. I was still wearing short trousers, but I fell romantically in love with her when she arrived at James Stewart\u2019s apartment in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jul/25/my-favourite-hitchcock-rear-window\" title=\"\">Rear Window</a> and crossed the room fluttering. Hitchcock did something to the camera so she seemed like an angel landing through a storm of desire. The desire was from me: I vowed from the second I saw her that there would never be another.</p> <p>But in real life she had already met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/apr/06/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"\">Prince Rainier</a>, whose trousers were long. And anyway, in the same cinema, I saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/debbie-reynolds\" title=\"\">Debbie Reynolds</a> in Two Weeks With Love. Playing her boyfriend, Carleton Carpenter had long trousers, but I calculated that his height advantage wouldn\u2019t matter if I could just write her a sufficiently adulatory letter. Then I saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/singin-in-the-rain\" title=\"\">Singin\u2019 In The Rain</a> and realised that my real male rival for Debbie\u2019s hand was Gene Kelly.</p> <p>While still practising the knee slide at the end of my dance routine, I saw <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046435/\" title=\"\">Titanic</a>. The greatest filmed version ever of the tragic story, it starred Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck, but it also featured a young lady who left both Grace and Debbie in the dust. Her name was <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0198241/\" title=\"\">Audrey Dalton</a> and I instantly realised that my lack of physical resemblance to the shyly smiling Robert Wagner was an irredeemable tragedy. I could just about imagine myself in long trousers, but where would I get such a chiselled jaw? I practised shy smiles in front of my dressing-table mirror until it cracked, but there was nothing left to do except fall for the British star <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0733540/\" title=\"\">Patricia Roc</a> instead.</p> <p>Grouped around me as I write this under close supervision, the females of my family are disabled by laughing pity, but they understand. They understand too damned well, in fact.</p> <p>\u2022 Clive James\u2019 most recent book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/river-in-the-sky-608353.html\" title=\"\">The River In The Sky</a>, is published by Picador.</p> <h2><strong>Marc Bolan by Julie Burchill</strong></h2> <p>They say you never forget your first love, but in my experience one\u2019s first flesh-and-blood romance is eminently forgettable \u2013 that\u2019s why so few people end up with them. The sex was probably fumbly rubbish and neither of you were likely to have much money, and if there\u2019s a combo guaranteed to make affection go awol, that\u2019s it. No, in my opinion, the love you never forget is your first famous crush \u2013 the one who effectively ended your childhood and set you on the rocky road to becoming yourself. Mine was Marc Bolan.</p> <p>As an 11-year-old determined to flee a provincial 1970s working-class home, it was about more than sex. It started there, yes, but it travelled all the way up into my brain; it allied sex and Getting Away, where previously I had associated sex with Getting Pregnant and Getting Trapped. As well as personifying sex for me, Bolan embodied London \u2013 that mythical land where I would finally become Myself. Indulging in yet another bout of self-abuse beneath a poster of him and a map of the underground, they seemed to merge and become one.</p> <p>From the first time I saw him on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2006/jun/20/topofthepopstheend\" title=\"\">TOTP</a> singing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDAh19tms4U\" title=\"\">Ride A White Swan</a>, I was Silly Putty in his silky paw. It was as if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/jun/21/clara-bow-wild-child-hollywood-history-silent-film\" title=\"\">Clara Bow</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/chuck-berry\" title=\"\">Chuck Berry</a> had been on a shopping spree in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/sep/11/biba-store-kensington-opens-1973\" title=\"\">Biba</a>; one minute a hoof-stamping stud, the next minute a bouncy, flouncy little girl at her own birthday party. But by the time I was 13, two much more serious and sexy love objects hove into view, creatures of substance as well as style. The ascendence of both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie\" title=\"\">David Bowie</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bryanferry\" title=\"\">Bryan Ferry</a> exposed Bolan\u2019s flimsiness; a chiffon flag bedraggled but fluttering gamely on in the hard rain of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gallery/2009/apr/16/past-conservatives\" title=\"\">Three-Day-Week Britain</a>. Ferry was a clever art-school boy and Bowie a hardened thespian, whereas Marc gave the impression of having not much hinterland to fall back on. When the beautiful view in the mirror withered, it would have been hard for him to find solace in books, to put it mildly. Sad to say, death became him, and he died a suitably Hollywood Babylon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/17/marc-bolan-death-car-crash-t-rex-1977\" title=\"\">death in a car crash</a>, driven by his lover, at the age of 29.</p> <p>My feelings for him had been extreme. As a Christian, I am not proud of the fact, but a few times \u2013 OK, maybe 20 \u2013 I drew pentagrams on my bedroom floor in chalk when my parents were out and promised my soul to Satan if we could get married when I was 18. Which makes it extra perverse that when I was 17 and he tried to chat me up in a club \u2013 not in a sad old lech way, either, but so sweetly and politely \u2013 I snubbed him. I was Myself now; he was a reminder of the time when I hadn\u2019t been. A few weeks later he was dead. I\u2019ll never forget him, because in a way I owe my life to him, almost as much as to my parents \u2013 not the life I was born into, but the one I wanted all along.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"896ce41ffca4cffcec68f4808205318519e16a3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/896ce41ffca4cffcec68f4808205318519e16a3a/1233_0_5971_5000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Composite of Audrey Dalton, Richard Madeley and Marc Bolan in a red heart, for a piece about teenage crushes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"837\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young loves (from left) Audrey Dalton, Richard Madeley and Marc Bolan. Photographs: Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Richard Madeley by Joe Stone</strong></h2> <p>In a television career spanning more than thirty 40 calamitous years, Richard Madeley has become known for his inimitable presenting style \u2013 whether interviewing Pprimordial dwarves (\u201cDo you find people patronise you? That means they talk down to you\u201d) or conducting casual drive-bys on his long suffering wife (\u201cRemember when you had thrush, Judy? You had a terrible time of it\u201d). But Richard isn\u2019t just the man behind some of the greatest on-air gaffes of all time. I\u2019m sorry to say that he\u2019s also the man behind my sexual awakening.</p> <p>I can\u2019t remember a time when I didn\u2019t fancy Richard. I know it was around the age of 10 that my fixation began impacting on my school attendance, as I found missing an episode of This Morning increasingly unthinkable. (As a result, I may never have developed an adequate grasp of algebra, but my knowledge of late-90s pet psychics is beyond reproach.) By the time Richard and Judy launched their book club, my crush was so established that I felt no shame in asking my local WHSmith to save me the promotional posters. I\u2019d cut them down the middle, putting Richard\u2019s half above my bed, and Judy\u2019s in the recycling. While other teenagers argued with their parents over curfews or smoking, the source of contention in my house was the phone bills I ran up trying to secure a slot playing You Say We Pay live. I wasn\u2019t even interested in a cash prize. I just wanted to speak to Richard.</p> <p>He was the pinnacle of debonair masculinity, the James Bond of daytime. Armchair psychologists may deduce that I had daddy issues, but I think that would be an oversimplification of my emotional issues. Perhaps my crush wasn\u2019t particularly \u201chealthy\u201d in retrospect but, I still maintain that Richard is very, very handsome. Yes, age has rendered his personality increasingly Partridge-esque \u2013 but looks-wise, he\u2019s holding up remarkably well. The lustrous side parting persists, an air of regality lingers.</p> <p>It\u2019s said that love arrives when you stop looking for it, and I did eventually meet Richard, some years after my crush had begun to dim. In my early 20s, I did an ill-advised stint as a TV runner, despite not being able to drive, hold a camera the right way round or conduct rudimentary social interactions. When Richard arrived at my production office unannounced on an unremarkable Wednesday, I initially assumed it was some kind of fever dream, or possibly the first indication that the rapture was upon us. I\u2019d like to say I played it cool, but you\u2019d know I was lying. \u201cHello,\u201d said Richard. \u201cFine thank you,\u201d I replied. After a heavy beat of mutual confusion he was whisked away by a producer, my opportunity lost, Judy\u2019s reign as the luckiest wife in showbiz unchallenged.</p> <p>\u2022 Joe Stone is commissioning editor on Guardian Weekend.</p> <h2><strong>Bobby Gillespie by Olivia Laing</strong></h2> <p>As a teenager, I had a type. Dark hair, very thin, unhealthy, melancholy and androgynous. Luckily for me, indie pop in the 1990s was built around high-cheekboned boys with hair in their eyes, home counties carbon copies of Bowie\u2019s thin white duke, each paler and skinnier than the last. Mark <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/nov/19/ride-10-of-the-best\" title=\"\">from Ride</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/brett-anderson\" title=\"\">Brett Anderson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jarvis-cocker\" title=\"\">Jarvis Cocker</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/26/richey-edwards-manic-street-preachers\" title=\"\">Richey from the Manics</a>. I pored over pictures of them in Melody Maker and the NME, bought what records I could afford and taped the rest off John Peel, poised over the stop button on my Sony ghetto blaster.</p> <p>But I wasn\u2019t satisfied with mooning at a distance. In the early 90s, I had a fanzine I deployed to get me into gigs for free. Pre-internet, that meant calling directory enquiries to get the number for Rough Trade or Muse records, and then persuading a sceptical PR that I needed tickets, maybe even an interview, though I was patently only 14. I met a lot of my crushes this way. Jarvis Cocker complimented me on my kipper tie, a thrill abruptly curtailed when later that evening the gig was stopped and the lights turned on so two of my friends\u2019 dads could reclaim their wayward daughters, plus furious me. In 1993, I played pool with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/radiohead\" title=\"\">Radiohead</a>, flush from the success of Creep, and was briefly pen pals with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/thom-yorke\" title=\"\">Thom Yorke</a> (he suggested I call my band Polly Pecker). As for Richey from the Manics, I gave him a demo tape of my terrible songs and in return he signed a pair of pink charity shop shoes that a few days later I wore to sit my GCSEs.</p> <p>But my real crush was on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bobby-gillespie\" title=\"\">Bobby Gillespie</a> from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/primal-scream\" title=\"\">Primal Scream</a>. Beautiful Bobby, with his long legs and greasy hair, inhabiting his own ecstatic planet. I listened to Screamadelica constantly, especially <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaPizqtODtE\" title=\"\">Damaged</a>, a love song as fragile and perfect as the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisHhIRihMY\" title=\"\">Velvet Underground\u2019s Pale Blue Eyes</a>. I had a long-running fantasy of such innocence that I wince to record it now. I liked to imagine Bobby Gillespie picking me up from school. He\u2019d probably be driving an American car, maybe a green Thunderbird. He\u2019d pick me up, everyone would see, and then \u2013 well, I wasn\u2019t sure. We\u2019d kiss, but I\u2019d also be transformed, into my adult, rock-star self. Kiss the prince and stop being a frog.</p> <p>In 1992, Bobby Gillespie made a mixtape of rock\u2019n\u2019roll love songs that was won by a reader of Select magazine. He put it together in his flat in Brighton: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/scott-walker\" title=\"\">Scott Walker</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/07/rod-stewart-fronts-the-faces-first-gig-forty-years\" title=\"\">the Faces</a>, Dennis Wilson, Big Star. I wanted a copy so badly I wrote to the magazine pretending I was Spanish, explaining my devotion in broken English. I don\u2019t know now why this seemed a good idea, but it worked.

      "bodyText": "Grace Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Audrey Dalton, by Clive James Grace Kelly\u2019s career began as a 10-year cluster of roles for US television, but we didn\u2019t see those in Australia, so her first movies made a terrific impact. She arose out of nowhere. I was still wearing short trousers, but I fell romantically in love with her when she arrived at James Stewart\u2019s apartment in Rear Window and crossed the room fluttering. Hitchcock did something to the camera so she seemed like an angel landing through a storm of desire. The desire was from me: I vowed from the second I saw her that there would never be another. But in real life she had already met Prince Rainier, whose trousers were long. And anyway, in the same cinema, I saw Debbie Reynolds in Two Weeks With Love. Playing her boyfriend, Carleton Carpenter had long trousers, but I calculated that his height advantage wouldn\u2019t matter if I could just write her a sufficiently adulatory letter. Then I saw Singin\u2019 In The Rain and realised that my real male rival for Debbie\u2019s hand was Gene Kelly. While still practising the knee slide at the end of my dance routine, I saw Titanic. The greatest filmed version ever of the tragic story, it starred Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck, but it also featured a young lady who left both Grace and Debbie in the dust. Her name was Audrey Dalton and I instantly realised that my lack of physical resemblance to the shyly smiling Robert Wagner was an irredeemable tragedy. I could just about imagine myself in long trousers, but where would I get such a chiselled jaw? I practised shy smiles in front of my dressing-table mirror until it cracked, but there was nothing left to do except fall for the British star Patricia Roc instead. Grouped around me as I write this under close supervision, the females of my family are disabled by laughing pity, but they understand. They understand too damned well, in fact. \u2022 Clive James\u2019 most recent book, The River In The Sky, is published by Picador. Marc Bolan by Julie Burchill They say you never forget your first love, but in my experience one\u2019s first flesh-and-blood romance is eminently forgettable \u2013 that\u2019s why so few people end up with them. The sex was probably fumbly rubbish and neither of you were likely to have much money, and if there\u2019s a combo guaranteed to make affection go awol, that\u2019s it. No, in my opinion, the love you never forget is your first famous crush \u2013 the one who effectively ended your childhood and set you on the rocky road to becoming yourself. Mine was Marc Bolan. As an 11-year-old determined to flee a provincial 1970s working-class home, it was about more than sex. It started there, yes, but it travelled all the way up into my brain; it allied sex and Getting Away, where previously I had associated sex with Getting Pregnant and Getting Trapped. As well as personifying sex for me, Bolan embodied London \u2013 that mythical land where I would finally become Myself. Indulging in yet another bout of self-abuse beneath a poster of him and a map of the underground, they seemed to merge and become one. From the first time I saw him on TOTP singing Ride A White Swan, I was Silly Putty in his silky paw. It was as if Clara Bow and Chuck Berry had been on a shopping spree in Biba; one minute a hoof-stamping stud, the next minute a bouncy, flouncy little girl at her own birthday party. But by the time I was 13, two much more serious and sexy love objects hove into view, creatures of substance as well as style. The ascendence of both David Bowie and Bryan Ferry exposed Bolan\u2019s flimsiness; a chiffon flag bedraggled but fluttering gamely on in the hard rain of Three-Day-Week Britain. Ferry was a clever art-school boy and Bowie a hardened thespian, whereas Marc gave the impression of having not much hinterland to fall back on. When the beautiful view in the mirror withered, it would have been hard for him to find solace in books, to put it mildly. Sad to say, death became him, and he died a suitably Hollywood Babylon death in a car crash, driven by his lover, at the age of 29. My feelings for him had been extreme. As a Christian, I am not proud of the fact, but a few times \u2013 OK, maybe 20 \u2013 I drew pentagrams on my bedroom floor in chalk when my parents were out and promised my soul to Satan if we could get married when I was 18. Which makes it extra perverse that when I was 17 and he tried to chat me up in a club \u2013 not in a sad old lech way, either, but so sweetly and politely \u2013 I snubbed him. I was Myself now; he was a reminder of the time when I hadn\u2019t been. A few weeks later he was dead. I\u2019ll never forget him, because in a way I owe my life to him, almost as much as to my parents \u2013 not the life I was born into, but the one I wanted all along. Richard Madeley by Joe Stone In a television career spanning more than thirty 40 calamitous years, Richard Madeley has become known for his inimitable presenting style \u2013 whether interviewing Pprimordial dwarves (\u201cDo you find people patronise you? That means they talk down to you\u201d) or conducting casual drive-bys on his long suffering wife (\u201cRemember when you had thrush, Judy? You had a terrible time of it\u201d). But Richard isn\u2019t just the man behind some of the greatest on-air gaffes of all time. I\u2019m sorry to say that he\u2019s also the man behind my sexual awakening. I can\u2019t remember a time when I didn\u2019t fancy Richard. I know it was around the age of 10 that my fixation began impacting on my school attendance, as I found missing an episode of This Morning increasingly unthinkable. (As a result, I may never have developed an adequate grasp of algebra, but my knowledge of late-90s pet psychics is beyond reproach.) By the time Richard and Judy launched their book club, my crush was so established that I felt no shame in asking my local WHSmith to save me the promotional posters. I\u2019d cut them down the middle, putting Richard\u2019s half above my bed, and Judy\u2019s in the recycling. While other teenagers argued with their parents over curfews or smoking, the source of contention in my house was the phone bills I ran up trying to secure a slot playing You Say We Pay live. I wasn\u2019t even interested in a cash prize. I just wanted to speak to Richard. He was the pinnacle of debonair masculinity, the James Bond of daytime. Armchair psychologists may deduce that I had daddy issues, but I think that would be an oversimplification of my emotional issues. Perhaps my crush wasn\u2019t particularly \u201chealthy\u201d in retrospect but, I still maintain that Richard is very, very handsome. Yes, age has rendered his personality increasingly Partridge-esque \u2013 but looks-wise, he\u2019s holding up remarkably well. The lustrous side parting persists, an air of regality lingers. It\u2019s said that love arrives when you stop looking for it, and I did eventually meet Richard, some years after my crush had begun to dim. In my early 20s, I did an ill-advised stint as a TV runner, despite not being able to drive, hold a camera the right way round or conduct rudimentary social interactions. When Richard arrived at my production office unannounced on an unremarkable Wednesday, I initially assumed it was some kind of fever dream, or possibly the first indication that the rapture was upon us. I\u2019d like to say I played it cool, but you\u2019d know I was lying. \u201cHello,\u201d said Richard. \u201cFine thank you,\u201d I replied. After a heavy beat of mutual confusion he was whisked away by a producer, my opportunity lost, Judy\u2019s reign as the luckiest wife in showbiz unchallenged. \u2022 Joe Stone is commissioning editor on Guardian Weekend. Bobby Gillespie by Olivia Laing As a teenager, I had a type. Dark hair, very thin, unhealthy, melancholy and androgynous. Luckily for me, indie pop in the 1990s was built around high-cheekboned boys with hair in their eyes, home counties carbon copies of Bowie\u2019s thin white duke, each paler and skinnier than the last. Mark from Ride, Brett Anderson, Jarvis Cocker, Richey from the Manics. I pored over pictures of them in Melody Maker and the NME, bought what records I could afford and taped the rest off John Peel, poised over the stop button on my Sony ghetto blaster. But I wasn\u2019t satisfied with mooning at a distance. In the early 90s, I had a fanzine I deployed to get me into gigs for free. Pre-internet, that meant calling directory enquiries to get the number for Rough Trade or Muse records, and then persuading a sceptical PR that I needed tickets, maybe even an interview, though I was patently only 14. I met a lot of my crushes this way. Jarvis Cocker complimented me on my kipper tie, a thrill abruptly curtailed when later that evening the gig was stopped and the lights turned on so two of my friends\u2019 dads could reclaim their wayward daughters, plus furious me. In 1993, I played pool with Radiohead, flush from the success of Creep, and was briefly pen pals with Thom Yorke (he suggested I call my band Polly Pecker). As for Richey from the Manics, I gave him a demo tape of my terrible songs and in return he signed a pair of pink charity shop shoes that a few days later I wore to sit my GCSEs. But my real crush was on Bobby Gillespie from Primal Scream. Beautiful Bobby, with his long legs and greasy hair, inhabiting his own ecstatic planet. I listened to Screamadelica constantly, especially Damaged, a love song as fragile and perfect as the Velvet Underground\u2019s Pale Blue Eyes. I had a long-running fantasy of such innocence that I wince to record it now. I liked to imagine Bobby Gillespie picking me up from school. He\u2019d probably be driving an American car, maybe a green Thunderbird. He\u2019d pick me up, everyone would see, and then \u2013 well, I wasn\u2019t sure. We\u2019d kiss, but I\u2019d also be transformed, into my adult, rock-star self. Kiss the prince and stop being a frog. In 1992, Bobby Gillespie made a mixtape of rock\u2019n\u2019roll love songs that was won by a reader of Select magazine. He put it together in his flat in Brighton: Scott Walker, the Faces, Dennis Wilson, Big Star. I wanted a copy so badly I wrote to the magazine pretending I was Spanish, explaining my devotion in broken English. I don\u2019t know now why this seemed a good idea, but it worked. I kept the tape for years, until some boyfriend (high-cheekboned, skinny, pale, borderline alcoholic) taped over it with Miles Davis. It was my talisman, my transitional object. Even now, I sort of think Bobby made it for me. \u2022 Olivia Laing\u2019s novel Crudo is published by Picador. Frank Ocean by Chidera Eggerue What\u2019s not to love?

He was 100% John Taylor. Tall, great cheekbones, gorgeously preserved. \u201cHngngngngngngnngngn,\u201d I said and shook his hand a bit like the Queen Mother. My ear lobes went red and I fled to the other corner of the gallery and stood feeling devastated, joyous and cross all at once. I still do not know what I want to do to John Taylor. Maybe in another 30 years, I\u2019ll figure this out. \u2022 Commenting on this piece?

Way started writing the books in 2007 when My Chemical Romance were trucking around the likes of Wembley Arena and, as such, it is partially inspired by his experiences on the road. \u201cIt\u2019s a little autobiographical, in terms of being about a dysfunctional family,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhich is a lot like being in a band.\u201d</p> <p>When I call the unerringly pleasant Way, he is in Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, in the ornate home that used to belong to surrealist artists Mark Ryden and Marion Peck.

Everyone in the team was picking fast, with olives tumbling into the plastic boxes they carried.</p> <p>Mohammad worked his way up the tree, layer by layer, using a ladder to reach the top branches. He was one of the fastest workers and was six trees down the line within a couple of hours. By 10am on this early autumn day, the temperature had risen to 27C (80F). Mohammad had worked non-stop. He\u2019d be paid piecework rates, so he had to give his best. He didn\u2019t even have a sip of water or toilet break \u2013 not that there was any water supply or toilet around.</p> <p>By the end of his 10-hour shift, which included a one-hour unpaid lunchbreak, Mohammad had picked 23 crates of olives, which earned him \u20ac69 (\u00a360).

But being \u201clegal\u201d does not mean you are given a legally enforceable contract. Mohammad works far more hours than his contract stipulates.

The asylum centres are emptied and rural ghettos are filled up, like the rural slum of Rosarno in Calabria, which has grown fast in recent weeks. Hundreds of migrants are abandoned in the street and have no alternative but to find refuge in these ghettos, in terrible conditions, without water [and] electricity.\u201d</p> <p>Salvatore Ingu\u00ec, coordinator of Libera, an anti-mafia human rights group, helped organise demonstrations in west Sicily against the decree. \u201cIt will not only make the idea of offering protection redundant, but will force many migrants to leave Italy or stay here as ghosts, living in hiding.\u201d</p> <p>Sicily is Europe\u2019s third largest producer of vegetables; Italy\u2019s food products are distributed across Europe. Yet it is shamefully built on the labour of an underground population, living a subhuman existence. </p> <p>The olive harvest came to an end in the winter; the orange harvest started in mid-January. African workers in Campobello who can\u2019t afford to move elsewhere will struggle to get through the cold winter, when there is less work and the <em>carabinieri</em>, Italy\u2019s national police force, will be on their backs once again. Meanwhile, those who buy their produce remain oblivious to their suffering.</p> <p>\u2022 Hsiao-Hung Pai is an investigative journalist and author</p>",

      "bodyText": "The dawn was about to break as I arrived, with a team of workers in the farmer\u2019s van, at the vast fields that stretch out for miles around Campobello, the \u201chandsome fields\u201d, in western Sicily. Everyone got out, and immediately started to work on their line of olive trees. It would take the team several weeks to harvest them. With swollen eyes from lack of sleep, Mohammad (not his real name) started with olives hanging down from the branches on the outside. Everyone in the team was picking fast, with olives tumbling into the plastic boxes they carried. Mohammad worked his way up the tree, layer by layer, using a ladder to reach the top branches. He was one of the fastest workers and was six trees down the line within a couple of hours. By 10am on this early autumn day, the temperature had risen to 27C (80F). Mohammad had worked non-stop. He\u2019d be paid piecework rates, so he had to give his best. He didn\u2019t even have a sip of water or toilet break \u2013 not that there was any water supply or toilet around. By the end of his 10-hour shift, which included a one-hour unpaid lunchbreak, Mohammad had picked 23 crates of olives, which earned him \u20ac69 (\u00a360). Most harvest workers were earning under \u20ac45 (\u00a339) because they weren\u2019t as fast as him. Piecework, when it constitutes a worker\u2019s only pay, is illegal in Italy, but it\u2019s the norm across the country \u2013 and can leave workers\u2019 pay well below the suggested rate for agricultural labourers. Mohammad is an asylum seeker from Gambia and received his humanitarian status and resident\u2019s permit years ago, which was required to get a work contract. But being \u201clegal\u201d does not mean you are given a legally enforceable contract. Mohammad works far more hours than his contract stipulates. Yet he carries on, despite the fact that his wages have never risen since he arrived in Italy five years ago \u2013 just like they haven\u2019t for most Africans working in agriculture in the country. During non-harvest periods, an African worker usually receives \u20ac2-3 per hour, compared to Italy\u2019s agricultural minimum wage, agreed by the industry, of \u20ac7.13. Mohammad and his co-workers have had to accept that their wages simply won\u2019t rise. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky to get paid at all,\u201d I was told. There are between 405,000-500,000 migrant workers in Italy\u2019s agricultural sector, around half of its total workforce. According to the Observatory Placido Rizzotto, which investigates worker conditions in the agricultural sector, 80% of those without contracts are migrant workers. Some Italian farmers have been exploiting them since they started to arrive in the 1970s. Urmila Bhoola, UN human rights special rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, reported last autumn that \u201cmigrant farm workers in parts of southern Italy are enduring extreme levels of labour exploitation and coercion, and inhuman working and living conditions\u201d. While the Campobello region absolutely needs African workers to harvest its olives, appropriate housing has never been provided by farmers (as obligated by law) while Africans often cannot rent rooms in town, as a direct result of deep-seated racism. They are not even allowed to congregate in makeshift camps as they must be out of public sight. Instead, they are dispersed among derelict farmhouses and sheds, former petrol stations and abandoned factories, in unsafe conditions and lacking basic facilities such as water and electricity. Under the hard-right government elected last summer, deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini\u2019s immigration-security decree will accelerate the illegalisation of asylum seekers and push people further into irregular work without any labour protection. \u201cHumanitarian protection\u201d, granted to African asylum seekers in previous years, will end. Francesco Caruso, an activist from the USB (Unione Sindacale di Base) in Calabria, another southern region, says: \u201cThe Salvini decree increases exploitation, caporalato (the gangmaster system) and social degradation ... The asylum centres are emptied and rural ghettos are filled up, like the rural slum of Rosarno in Calabria, which has grown fast in recent weeks. Hundreds of migrants are abandoned in the street and have no alternative but to find refuge in these ghettos, in terrible conditions, without water [and] electricity.\u201d Salvatore Ingu\u00ec, coordinator of Libera, an anti-mafia human rights group, helped organise demonstrations in west Sicily against the decree. \u201cIt will not only make the idea of offering protection redundant, but will force many migrants to leave Italy or stay here as ghosts, living in hiding.\u201d Sicily is Europe\u2019s third largest producer of vegetables; Italy\u2019s food products are distributed across Europe. Yet it is shamefully built on the labour of an underground population, living a subhuman existence. The olive harvest came to an end in the winter; the orange harvest started in mid-January. African workers in Campobello who can\u2019t afford to move elsewhere will struggle to get through the cold winter, when there is less work and the carabinieri, Italy\u2019s national police force, will be on their backs once again. Meanwhile, those who buy their produce remain oblivious to their suffering. \u2022 Hsiao-Hung Pai is an investigative journalist and author",

      "body": "<p>In her 2017 memoir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/05/yiyun-li-dear-friend-from-my-life-memoir-lara-feigel-non-fiction\" title=\"\"><em>Dear Friend, from My Life I Write to You in Your Life</em></a>, Yiyun Li describes her own journal as \u201ca long argument with myself: a lucid voice questioning judiciously, and a more forceful voice speaking defiantly\u201d. This is the form of <em>Where Reasons End</em>, a novel structured as a series of dialogues. Where her memoir began as an endeavour to understand and survive her own suicide attempt, the novel is the narrator\u2019s endeavour to understand and survive the suicide of her 16-year-old son and is dedicated to Li\u2019s own son, who killed himself in 2017.</p> <p>The unnamed narrator, like Li herself, is a Chinese-American novelist, obsessively exact in her use of language. Her dead son Nikolai, a precocious poet with a talent for baking, is \u201cunyielding to the point of extravagant intrepidity\u201d, unable to tolerate his own imperfections. This is a boy who charmed everyone with his wit and his oboe playing, but who found life almost unbearable: a tragic genius just about able to mock himself and be mocked for this persona. Grieving friends ask how they missed his pain and she must explain that for some people a facade is necessary even with those closest to them.</p> <p>Several weeks after Nikolai\u2019s death, the boy appears to his mother on an ordinary morning and the dialogues begin: he reads her thoughts and speaks his responses. We\u2019re not dealing with anything so uncouth as a ghost, but he\u2019s present less as a physical being than as a series of words, volleyed between the living and the dead as they parse the meanings of \u201cdeadline\u201d and \u201cdead end\u201d.</p> <p>As in George Saunders\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/08/lincoln-in-the-bardo-george-saunders-review\" title=\"\"><em>Lincoln in the Bardo</em></a>, there\u2019s a sense of an underworld with rules of its own. Nikolai is unable to see physical objects or feel diurnal rhythms. Not knowing the rules, she worries that he\u2019ll vanish if she transgresses. But where Saunders portrayed a boy taken up by a community of the dead, making the Bardo as real for the reader as the world of the living, here the reader is confined in the more claustrophobic world of the narrator\u2019s mind.</p> <p>Nikolai\u2019s mother knows that she\u2019s probably just inventing the dialogues and is \u201ca generic parent grieving a generic child lost to an inexplicable tragedy\u201d. Mother and son can entwine easily in her mind because they were once joined as flesh. \u201cI was almost you once, and that\u2019s why I have allowed myself to make up this world to talk with you.\u201d One of the most moving aspects of the book is its perplexed return to babyhood: the pained knowledge that the mother\u2019s grief is unique because this creature has grown inside her. \u201cAny seasoned parent was an expert at catching,\u201d she observes, wondering why, having caught the toppling baby and the somersaulting spoons, she has been left with nothing to catch except words.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f7ce560ac131a9f725e9d2c023510bbfce01632b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7ce560ac131a9f725e9d2c023510bbfce01632b/0_49_5722_3433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yiyun Li in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yiyun Li in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As always, Li writes with a shimmering and deeply felt precision.

But it feels now as though her whole writing life has been paring down towards this more intimate form. Its compression is hard won, the result both of harrowing lived experience and of moving through realism to something a bit like autofiction, insistent on its integrity. She is no longer creating characters, but giving us their voices in a kind of sustained present, never concealing the fact that we are reading words typed on a page. And her sustained investigation of the relationship between thought and feeling has become the central drama.</p> <p>Li had a career as a scientist before turning to fiction, and she described her habit of scientifically examining every thought in her memoir. There she denigrated her tendency to use thoughts to keep feelings at bay. \u201cI dread the moment when a thought trails off and a feeling starts,\u201d she wrote. But she also admiringly quoted Marianne Moore, who writes in the poem <a href=\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/silence-2\" title=\"\">\u201cSilence\u201d</a> that \u201cThe deepest feeling always shows itself in silence; / not in silence, but restraint\u201d. Love and suffering, Li was suggesting, are just as strong in those who appear to be thinking too much to feel.</p> <p>In <em>Where Reasons End</em>, both the narrator and her son are preoccupied with the relationship between thinking and suffering. She tells him that she wishes to avoid suffering by being less \u201csharp and bright\u201d and that he suffers more because of his insistence on clarity. \u201cI suffer more because you want to do what the world does, to dim the bright and to blunt the sharp,\u201d he retorts. And she can only agree: he has, after all, learned his sharpness from her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Both the narrator and her son are preoccupied with the relationship between thinking and suffering</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The question of blame around suicide is always appallingly freighted. Because she understands suffering, she can\u2019t blame her son for killing himself. Instead she accepts his blame for forcing him to be alive in the first place. For years before his death, he\u2019d said: \u201cIf you write about suffering, if you understand suffering, why did you give me a life?\u201d It\u2019s both a reasonable question and a shocking one. What right do we have to create life? Perhaps we are all versions of Frankenstein when we do so, inflicting a terrifying freedom on another creature and having to accept that it\u2019s up to our progeny to decide how to use that life and whether to sustain it.</p> <p>When Nikolai was alive and he asked this question, she could only answer with cliches, promising vaguely that everything would work out in the end. Now she thinks that he\u2019s entitled to query why parents feel they have the right to give their children lives, but insists that \u201ca mind that sees no path or direction to flee despair can be expanded nevertheless. Who can say if expansion may not one day make despair sufferable?\u201d</p> <p>This question haunts the book. Could he have learned to expand his mind, and therefore to find life bearable, if he\u2019d made himself live long enough to try it? Certainly there\u2019s a kind of airy expansiveness in the dialogues, especially when, a few pages before the end, Nikolai dismisses words for falling short of making the unspoken speakable. \u201cWords fall short, yes,\u201d she responds, \u201cbut sometimes their shadows can reach the unspeakable.\u201d Do words have shadows, he asks, sceptically. Yes they do, she says, because we look for depths in words that we can\u2019t find in life.</p> <p>It\u2019s moving to hear the narrator, who has sought linguistic precision all her life, placing her faith in the shadows beneath the surface of language. If Nikolai could have allowed himself to dwell in the shadows, perhaps he could have lived. What good can it do him to learn this now? But the argument with her son is of course ultimately an argument with herself. And it\u2019s through this expansive movement between words and their shadows that the narrator can experience the full devastation of her grief at the same time as keeping in view her son\u2019s perspective, honouring his right to end his own life and acknowledging, as Li wrote in her memoir, that \u201cone\u2019s wish to die can be as blind and intuitive as one\u2019s will to live\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

      "body": "<p>\u201cSo, you saw the film?\u201d Barry Jenkins is eager to ask the minute we are introduced. He gives good eye contact through those stylish thick-rimmed glasses \u2013 not the big-time, Oscar-winning writer-director speaking, but a nervous artist, anxious about the new work he is starting to screen. I love it, I tell him. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/10/if-beale-street-could-talk-review-barry-jenkins-tragic-romance-soars\" title=\"\">If Beale Street Could Talk</a> may be only Jenkins\u2019 third feature-length film, but it has already been nominated for three Oscars (best adapted screenplay, best supporting actress, best score), just two years after his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/16/moonlight-review-masculinity-naomie-harris\" title=\"\">Moonlight</a> walked away with the Academy Award for best film. A passionate film about race and love, it\u2019s an added pleasure to see black characters of such complexity on the big screen. British film industry, kindly take note.</p> <p>Adapted from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/22/james-baldwin-interview-1962\" title=\"\">James Baldwin</a>\u2019s 1974 novel, Beale Street tells the story of a young black couple in 1970s Harlem. When Tish (KiKi Layne) becomes pregnant, they plan to marry \u2013 until her fiance Fonny (Stephan James) is set up by a racist police officer for a rape he did not commit. The film explores the different reactions of their siblings and parents, led by Regina King in a standout performance as Tish\u2019s mother, as they fight for Fonny\u2019s freedom.</p> <p>Baldwin has been dead for 30 years, but his depiction of the fight against a country\u2019s powerful prejudice is a sad reminder that not enough has changed, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Still Matter</a>. Yet Jenkins turns a bleak story into a compelling romance, as the young lovers strive to be regarded as human beings. With its lingering, saturated-colour photography \u2013 the director has cited Wong Kar-Wai\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/dec/19/in-the-mood-for-love\" title=\"\">In The Mood For Love</a> as an influence \u2013 Beale Street is one of the most visually arresting films I\u2019ve seen.</p> <p>\u201cThat was kind of our intention,\u201d says Jenkins, who also wrote the screenplay. \u201cWe thought, \u2018How cool would it be, to have this absolutely ravishingly gorgeous depiction of black romance, just pure and lush and vibrant \u2013 but then really lean into the systemic injustice issues that Baldwin\u2019s talking about \u2013 with a very angry, almost bitter voice?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6252a84138ebcd0a080783927c05e40fcf53f958\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6252a84138ebcd0a080783927c05e40fcf53f958/0_121_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Director Barry Jenkins n the set of If Beale Street Could Talk (2018).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the set of If Beale Street Could Talk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tatum Mangus/Annapurna Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beale Street was filmed on location in New York and the Dominican Republic \u2013 filling in for Puerto Rico, still devastated by 2017\u2019s Hurricane Maria. It was shot on an Arri Alexa 65 camera, Jenkins tells me (he\u2019s a little bit geeky like this: taking joy in the details of the craft), because \u201cit is the best digital camera for portraiture\u201d. Throughout the film, as he did in Moonlight, the director lingers over often wordless scenes between his characters, presenting them as a series of moving photographs.</p> <p>I tell him that if Moonlight didn\u2019t finally kill off the ugly argument (and I have heard it, from producers and directors alike) that you can\u2019t film black people because they\u2019re just too dark, then Beale Street surely will. \u201cMy cinematographer is a white guy, actually,\u201d Jenkins points out, referring to James Laxton, who also worked with him on Moonlight. \u201cWe both prioritise exactly what you\u2019re talking about. Every day we\u2019re on set and we\u2019re in colour correction. And it\u2019s always, \u2018But how was the skin? What are we doing to protect the skin?\u2019 Not even protect: \u2018What are we doing to properly calibrate what we\u2019re doing for the skin?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3d583c74cc68494ec233ed5beb18783af045a4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3d583c74cc68494ec233ed5beb18783af045a4d/0_108_1666_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medicine For Melancholy (2008).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jenkins\u2019 2008 film Medicine For Melancholy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the distinctive features of this film, and of Moonlight, is a series of straight-to-camera shots, where the actors seem to directly address the audience, without dialogue. Jenkins says he films these shots without really knowing where they will go, or how he will use them. \u201cSometimes I see an actor slip into that place where there\u2019s no separation between the actor and the character. That\u2019s when you do these things. The actor isn\u2019t acting. They\u2019re just being.\u201d He says he was struck by a recent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/04/magazine/barry-jenkins-james-baldwin-if-beale-street-could-talk.html\" title=\"\">New York Times profile</a> of him by the novelist Angela Flournoy, in which she observed the effect of these almost meditative moments in Beale Street. \u201cShe was saying that, for non-black audiences, these scenes are so charged, because for them it might be the first time they have ever looked a black person directly in the eye in this [meditative] state. And for black audiences, they see someone they know. It just never occurred to me. Then I looked out at a recent Q&amp;A, for a mostly white audience, and I realised, holy shit, this might be true \u2013 that a large percentage of this audience have never looked someone like Stephan James in the eye in an unbroken moment of connection.\u201d</p> <p>While Jenkins\u2019 film largely honours Baldwin\u2019s novel, the director has added a new ending that follows the original \u2013 giving the audience just a glimpse of hope. Even so, he is convinced he has remained faithful to the book\u2019s central message. Which is? \u201cI think it would be: \u2018We are not broken. You cannot break us.\u2019 I wanted to show that, even in the most devastating circumstance, the family unit had not been broken.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A girlfriend told me I needed to grow up. That's how I found James Baldwin</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He wrote the script almost simultaneously with that for Moonlight, on a trip to Europe in the summer of 2013. Jenkins bought a return ticket to Brussels, booked into an Airbnb for two weeks, and first \u2013 because adapting Baldwin looked too daunting to kick off with \u2013 started on Moonlight. \u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019ll just get my legs\u2019, because I hadn\u2019t written anything in a while. And then I\u2019ll switch to Beale Street.\u201d When the Moonlight script came together in 10 days, he travelled to Berlin for fresh inspiration, writing Beale Street over the next four weeks \u2013 an intensely productive period.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had that happen again in my life. I\u2019ve tried to replicate it, and I think the reason it worked was because, as a human being, I ceased to exist. I didn\u2019t have any friends, I didn\u2019t have a cell phone, I didn\u2019t know anyone, I had no family. It was just the bartenders who were helping me, giving me caffeine or alcohol.\u201d</p> <p>Jenkins came to Baldwin as an adult. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up as a voracious reader. James Baldwin was recommended to me by a girlfriend, who was a little older than me, more mature, worldlier, smarter, more attractive,\u201d he says, with a laugh. \u201cAnd she, in breaking up with me, recommended \u2013 so I could grow up \u2013 that I read James Baldwin: \u2018I\u2019m done with you, but I\u2019m going to give you a hint. You need to read James Baldwin.\u2019 She recommended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/19/james-baldwin-giovannis-room-garth-greenwell-60th-anniversary-gay-novel\" title=\"\">Giovanni\u2019s Room</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/15/the-fire-this-time-legacy-of-james-baldwin\" title=\"\">The Fire Next Time</a>.

Part of Winfrey\u2019s mission was to make movies that would encourage people to read those authors. Has literary adaptation always been part of Jenkins\u2019 own plan? Beale Street is the first English-language Baldwin adaptation, and Jenkins had to lobby the writer\u2019s estate hard to make it. \u201cAs a visual storyteller, it\u2019s just nice to have someone, like Mr Baldwin, or <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4144120/\" title=\"\">Tarell Alvin McCraney </a>[the American playwright and Jenkins\u2019 co-writer on Moonlight] who\u2019s already put so much thought and so much richness into the source material, that I can then take and try to find ways to lift it up even higher, taking it into this realm from that,\u201d he explains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b4cfdf91ea6a40fda28a9d862f4c6a1f6291cf4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4cfdf91ea6a40fda28a9d862f4c6a1f6291cf4b/0_367_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moonlight (2016).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Moonlight, Jenkins says, he watched \u2018the actors relive some of the things we lived through\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jenkins is currently working on another adaptation, of the Pulitzer prize-winning novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/10/colson-whitehead-underground-railroad-pulitzer-prize-2017\" title=\"\">The Underground Railroad</a>, by Colson Whitehead.

So, I didn\u2019t think there was anything extraordinarily disadvantaged about my upbringing until I extended further out into the world and saw that not everybody grows up this way. That, \u2018Oh, this thing I\u2019m just learning about now, these kids learned about when they were <em>five</em>. And these comforts that I\u2019m just experiencing now, these kids have experienced their entire lives. When I was growing up, it just didn\u2019t seem cruel or difficult at all. It was only in the making of this film [Moonlight], and to be honest, watching the actors relive some of the things we lived through. Then it was like, \u2018Woah, that was an ordeal.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Which films inspired him, growing up? \u201cI wasn\u2019t really inspired by film,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I admired Spike Lee\u2019s movies because they just felt very, very, very black. I remember watching School Daze and thinking, \u2018What the hell is this?\u2019 There were colleges for black people that just black people go to? And those colleges had all this shit going on? This is so energising!</p> <p>\u201cOtherwise, it was the really big Hollywood stuff \u2013 The Color Purple, Aliens, Die Hard, Coming To America. I would catch the bus to go to the AMC theatre downtown. But I never thought, \u2018Hey, maybe one day I might like to do that.\u2019 It just didn\u2019t seem possible.\u201d</p> <p>Winning an Academy Award for best picture must have felt even more farfetched. He grins when I bring up one of the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/27/anatomy-of-an-oscars-fiasco-how-la-la-land-was-mistakenly-announced-as-best-picture\" title=\"\">rollercoaster nights in Oscar history</a>.

It wasn\u2019t an unexpected result, it wasn\u2019t a shocking result. The only thing shocking about the whole night to me was the switch, you know? I remember hugging Jordan Horowitz [co-producer of La La Land], and I remember hugging Damien Chazelle, and just the look on everyone: \u2018What the hell just happened?\u2019 I remember seeing Warren Beatty backstage, him showing me the actual card, and me for the first time believing \u2013 or accepting \u2013 that we had won best picture. Because there\u2019s nothing written on the Oscar when you first get it. It was a very wild night. Very wild.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cadcd238f3efaa4d7378f70f371ea0a07a9e0223\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cadcd238f3efaa4d7378f70f371ea0a07a9e0223/0_2321_6192_5935/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Film-maker Barry Jenkins\" width=\"1000\" height=\"958\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The only shocking thing about the Oscars night was the switch, you know.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Quinton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/25/did-oscars-so-white-work-looking-beyond-the-diversity-drought-in-hollywood\" title=\"\">#OscarsSoWhite</a> furore of the previous year (when there was not a single actor or director of colour among 25 nominees), there must have been air punches around the globe when Moonlight belatedly scooped the prize. \u201cI have no doubt that the OscarsSoWhite thing played a role in Moonlight\u2019s success,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cBut when it becomes, \u2018Oh, Moonlight only won because of OscarsSoWhite,\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Well, say a film won the top award from this critics\u2019 body, then that same film was the highest-rated film on this website, then it goes on to have one of the 10 highest ratings on Metacritic in the history of the website \u2013 if I told you that same film won best picture, you wouldn\u2019t question it. But if I told you a black film about a gay black boy whose mom is addicted to crack-cocaine won best picture, then you go, \u201cOh, it only won because of diversity,\u2019\u201d he laughs.</p> <p>A new renaissance in black film-making is declared every few years, but this time it feels there\u2019s some truth and momentum to it. As well as Jenkins, in the US there is Ryan Coogler, who directed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/06/black-panther-review-marvel-wakanda-chadwick-boseman\" title=\"\">Black Panther</a> and is working on a sequel; Spike Lee (nominated for his first Oscar last month, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/14/blackkklansman-review-spike-lee-adam-driver-cannes-2018\" title=\"\">BlacKkKlansman</a>); Training Day director Antoine Fuqua; Ava DuVernay (Selma, A Wrinkle In Time); and Jordan Peele (Get Out and the upcoming Us).</p> <p>\u201cI think there\u2019s something about the present moment that is collectively inspiring,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cI don\u2019t think any one of us sees the success of another and feels anything but joy and pride. And I can see that the generation behind us, they see that, and they feed off it.</p> <p>\u201cYou have people like Ava, Ryan and Jordan who are leading by example. Ava did Selma and then created this television show [Queen Sugar], and said every episode was going to be directed by a woman, most of them women of colour. Jordan had massive success with Get Out, and said, \u2018Hey Spike, I\u2019m going to help you make this film\u2019 [BlacKkKlansman, which Peele produced]. When you climb the ladder, you send it back down. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s been happening for the last 10 to 15 years.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59fe25d93b5a85448c2e808b8a41f0fcb85bc0e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59fe25d93b5a85448c2e808b8a41f0fcb85bc0e1/0_129_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barry Jenkins finally receives the 2017 best picture Oscar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jenkins finally receives the 2017 best picture Oscar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He points to technology as another democratising force. \u201cYou see more people from backgrounds that are way outside the core centre, which has always been hetero white American men in the Hollywood system. You can go to any film festival in the world right now, and there are so many people just \u2013 not waiting, because waiting\u2019s the wrong word, but who are going to get put on one way or the other. And your ass is going to get left behind if you\u2019re not hiring these people.\u201d Dear British film industry, again, please take note.</p> <p>I tell Jenkins I look forward to the day when the list of British black film-makers who have been entrusted to make hits is as long as the American one. But the director says he has always admired the European system of financing films. \u201cHere are the funds: you don\u2019t have to really worry about the commercial prospects because it\u2019s not private money, it\u2019s public money, and so it\u2019s just about the art. Stateside, it\u2019s almost impossible to raise the funds to make a movie like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/mar/06/hunger-reel-history-bobby-sands-hunger-strike\" title=\"\">Steve McQueen\u2019s Hunger</a>, and to make it in that style.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, I say, the US seems more awake to the talents of a generation of British actors and film-makers: Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Amma Asante, John Boyega, Aml Ameen, Naomie Harris \u2013 all of whom have followed the likes of Idris Elba to work Stateside, and who can blame them? How many more times can they play a stabbing victim on Casualty? But Jenkins doesn\u2019t want to overstate the opportunities the US has to offer, especially now. \u201cWe were moving in this direction where we were trying to eradicate borders, and now we\u2019re trying to build them again,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to think about how we went from the election of Barack Obama to the election of a reality TV star with a heinous past. There were many millions of people who voted for this guy, and I\u2019m trying to understand why that is. What was it about the present moment that made them feel, \u2018This is a direction I don\u2019t want the country to go in? <em>This</em> is the direction I want the country to go in.\u2019 Borders and lies and fake this and xenophobic that.\u201d He sighs.</p> <p>Instead, Jenkins thinks there are reasons to be positive about black British culture right now \u2013 and that a change is coming soon. He gives an example. Just over a year ago, he was in London and looking for a quiet place to write. He went to Soho House and, spotting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/10/daniel-kaluuya-not-spokesperson-black-people-black-panther-get-out\" title=\"\">Daniel Kaluuya</a> in a corner, went over to say hello before starting work. \u201cI was there writing for four or five hours, and there were all these young black men who just kept coming in and sitting down with Daniel. I recognised one of them, Kibwe Tavares, who directed Jonah, which Daniel starred in. This was at the height of Get Out and Daniel was having all these meetings with young black UK directors. And just from watching the demeanour of it, I could tell he was like, \u2018What are you working on? What\u2019s going on? How can we build?\u2019 And so, this shit\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 If Beale Street Could Talk is out now. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/08/roy-williams-interview-soul-play-marvin-gaye-royal-derngate-hackney-empire\" title=\"\">Roy Williams</a>\u2019 plays include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/jun/20/sucker-punch-theatre-review\" title=\"\">Sucker Punch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/jun/19/theatre.artsfeatures\" title=\"\">Fallout</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/may/03/theatre1\" title=\"\">Sing Yer Heart Out For The Lads</a></p> <p>If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cSo, you saw the film?\u201d Barry Jenkins is eager to ask the minute we are introduced. He gives good eye contact through those stylish thick-rimmed glasses \u2013 not the big-time, Oscar-winning writer-director speaking, but a nervous artist, anxious about the new work he is starting to screen. I love it, I tell him. If Beale Street Could Talk may be only Jenkins\u2019 third feature-length film, but it has already been nominated for three Oscars (best adapted screenplay, best supporting actress, best score), just two years after his Moonlight walked away with the Academy Award for best film. A passionate film about race and love, it\u2019s an added pleasure to see black characters of such complexity on the big screen. British film industry, kindly take note. Adapted from James Baldwin\u2019s 1974 novel, Beale Street tells the story of a young black couple in 1970s Harlem. When Tish (KiKi Layne) becomes pregnant, they plan to marry \u2013 until her fiance Fonny (Stephan James) is set up by a racist police officer for a rape he did not commit. The film explores the different reactions of their siblings and parents, led by Regina King in a standout performance as Tish\u2019s mother, as they fight for Fonny\u2019s freedom. Baldwin has been dead for 30 years, but his depiction of the fight against a country\u2019s powerful prejudice is a sad reminder that not enough has changed, that Black Lives Still Matter. Yet Jenkins turns a bleak story into a compelling romance, as the young lovers strive to be regarded as human beings. With its lingering, saturated-colour photography \u2013 the director has cited Wong Kar-Wai\u2019s In The Mood For Love as an influence \u2013 Beale Street is one of the most visually arresting films I\u2019ve seen. \u201cThat was kind of our intention,\u201d says Jenkins, who also wrote the screenplay. \u201cWe thought, \u2018How cool would it be, to have this absolutely ravishingly gorgeous depiction of black romance, just pure and lush and vibrant \u2013 but then really lean into the systemic injustice issues that Baldwin\u2019s talking about \u2013 with a very angry, almost bitter voice?\u2019\u201d Beale Street was filmed on location in New York and the Dominican Republic \u2013 filling in for Puerto Rico, still devastated by 2017\u2019s Hurricane Maria. It was shot on an Arri Alexa 65 camera, Jenkins tells me (he\u2019s a little bit geeky like this: taking joy in the details of the craft), because \u201cit is the best digital camera for portraiture\u201d. Throughout the film, as he did in Moonlight, the director lingers over often wordless scenes between his characters, presenting them as a series of moving photographs. I tell him that if Moonlight didn\u2019t finally kill off the ugly argument (and I have heard it, from producers and directors alike) that you can\u2019t film black people because they\u2019re just too dark, then Beale Street surely will. \u201cMy cinematographer is a white guy, actually,\u201d Jenkins points out, referring to James Laxton, who also worked with him on Moonlight. \u201cWe both prioritise exactly what you\u2019re talking about. Every day we\u2019re on set and we\u2019re in colour correction. And it\u2019s always, \u2018But how was the skin? What are we doing to protect the skin?\u2019 Not even protect: \u2018What are we doing to properly calibrate what we\u2019re doing for the skin?\u2019\u201d One of the distinctive features of this film, and of Moonlight, is a series of straight-to-camera shots, where the actors seem to directly address the audience, without dialogue. Jenkins says he films these shots without really knowing where they will go, or how he will use them. \u201cSometimes I see an actor slip into that place where there\u2019s no separation between the actor and the character. That\u2019s when you do these things. The actor isn\u2019t acting. They\u2019re just being.\u201d He says he was struck by a recent New York Times profile of him by the novelist Angela Flournoy, in which she observed the effect of these almost meditative moments in Beale Street. \u201cShe was saying that, for non-black audiences, these scenes are so charged, because for them it might be the first time they have ever looked a black person directly in the eye in this [meditative] state. And for black audiences, they see someone they know. It just never occurred to me. Then I looked out at a recent Q&amp;A, for a mostly white audience, and I realised, holy shit, this might be true \u2013 that a large percentage of this audience have never looked someone like Stephan James in the eye in an unbroken moment of connection.\u201d While Jenkins\u2019 film largely honours Baldwin\u2019s novel, the director has added a new ending that follows the original \u2013 giving the audience just a glimpse of hope. Even so, he is convinced he has remained faithful to the book\u2019s central message. Which is? \u201cI think it would be: \u2018We are not broken. You cannot break us.\u2019 I wanted to show that, even in the most devastating circumstance, the family unit had not been broken.\u201d He wrote the script almost simultaneously with that for Moonlight, on a trip to Europe in the summer of 2013. Jenkins bought a return ticket to Brussels, booked into an Airbnb for two weeks, and first \u2013 because adapting Baldwin looked too daunting to kick off with \u2013 started on Moonlight. \u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019ll just get my legs\u2019, because I hadn\u2019t written anything in a while. And then I\u2019ll switch to Beale Street.\u201d When the Moonlight script came together in 10 days, he travelled to Berlin for fresh inspiration, writing Beale Street over the next four weeks \u2013 an intensely productive period. \u201cI\u2019ve never had that happen again in my life. I\u2019ve tried to replicate it, and I think the reason it worked was because, as a human being, I ceased to exist. I didn\u2019t have any friends, I didn\u2019t have a cell phone, I didn\u2019t know anyone, I had no family. It was just the bartenders who were helping me, giving me caffeine or alcohol.\u201d Jenkins came to Baldwin as an adult. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up as a voracious reader. James Baldwin was recommended to me by a girlfriend, who was a little older than me, more mature, worldlier, smarter, more attractive,\u201d he says, with a laugh. \u201cAnd she, in breaking up with me, recommended \u2013 so I could grow up \u2013 that I read James Baldwin: \u2018I\u2019m done with you, but I\u2019m going to give you a hint. You need to read James Baldwin.\u2019 She recommended Giovanni\u2019s Room and The Fire Next Time. That was how my love affair began.\u201d **** In his first job after film school, Jenkins, now 39, worked as an assistant at Harpo Films, Oprah Winfrey\u2019s company which, before shutting down in 2013, focused on literary adaptations (Toni Morrison\u2019s Beloved, Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s Their Eyes Were Watching God). Part of Winfrey\u2019s mission was to make movies that would encourage people to read those authors. Has literary adaptation always been part of Jenkins\u2019 own plan? Beale Street is the first English-language Baldwin adaptation, and Jenkins had to lobby the writer\u2019s estate hard to make it. \u201cAs a visual storyteller, it\u2019s just nice to have someone, like Mr Baldwin, or Tarell Alvin McCraney [the American playwright and Jenkins\u2019 co-writer on Moonlight] who\u2019s already put so much thought and so much richness into the source material, that I can then take and try to find ways to lift it up even higher, taking it into this realm from that,\u201d he explains. Jenkins is currently working on another adaptation, of the Pulitzer prize-winning novel The Underground Railroad, by Colson Whitehead. It is the story of two slaves who escape southern plantations through a network of safe houses and secret tunnels to reach the northern states, where they will be free. Working with a team of screenwriters, Jenkins will direct a 10-hour TV series for Amazon. Moonlight was based on McCraney\u2019s semi-autobiographical play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, about a tough childhood with a drug-addicted mother, and a painful coming out. Both McCraney and Jenkins grew up in the predominantly black, working-class Miami neighbourhood of Liberty City, attending the same high school (Jenkins is a year older). \u201cWe never knew each other,\u201d the director says. \u201cThis is sad to say, but I might not have been brave enough to have been Tarell\u2019s friend when we were kids. I feel like Tarell was always proud to be who he was, and was likely ostracised for it. I was more a follower than a leader, you know, when I was that age.\u201d Like McCraney, Jenkins\u2019 mother was an addict, and he was raised by a family friend, his father having died when he was 12. Two years ago, the director told the Guardian: \u201cThere were seven or eight of us in a two-bed apartment. There was usually food, but sometimes not.\u201d How did his childhood shape him? \u201cI think when you know nothing else, that thing becomes normalised. So, I didn\u2019t think there was anything extraordinarily disadvantaged about my upbringing until I extended further out into the world and saw that not everybody grows up this way. That, \u2018Oh, this thing I\u2019m just learning about now, these kids learned about when they were five. And these comforts that I\u2019m just experiencing now, these kids have experienced their entire lives. When I was growing up, it just didn\u2019t seem cruel or difficult at all. It was only in the making of this film [Moonlight], and to be honest, watching the actors relive some of the things we lived through. Then it was like, \u2018Woah, that was an ordeal.\u2019\u201d Which films inspired him, growing up? \u201cI wasn\u2019t really inspired by film,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I admired Spike Lee\u2019s movies because they just felt very, very, very black. I remember watching School Daze and thinking, \u2018What the hell is this?\u2019 There were colleges for black people that just black people go to? And those colleges had all this shit going on? This is so energising! \u201cOtherwise, it was the really big Hollywood stuff \u2013 The Color Purple, Aliens, Die Hard, Coming To America. I would catch the bus to go to the AMC theatre downtown. But I never thought, \u2018Hey, maybe one day I might like to do that.\u2019 It just didn\u2019t seem possible.\u201d Winning an Academy Award for best picture must have felt even more farfetched. He grins when I bring up one of the most rollercoaster nights in Oscar history. How did he feel when Damien Chazelle\u2019s widely tipped La La Land was announced the winner of the best picture Oscar in 2017, before the error was corrected? \u201cOK.\u201d Jenkins takes a breath and takes himself back to the night in question. \u201cWhen Faye Dunaway read out La La Land, it was perfectly fine, you know? It wasn\u2019t an unexpected result, it wasn\u2019t a shocking result. The only thing shocking about the whole night to me was the switch, you know? I remember hugging Jordan Horowitz [co-producer of La La Land], and I remember hugging Damien Chazelle, and just the look on everyone: \u2018What the hell just happened?\u2019 I remember seeing Warren Beatty backstage, him showing me the actual card, and me for the first time believing \u2013 or accepting \u2013 that we had won best picture. Because there\u2019s nothing written on the Oscar when you first get it. It was a very wild night. Very wild.\u201d Given the #OscarsSoWhite furore of the previous year (when there was not a single actor or director of colour among 25 nominees), there must have been air punches around the globe when Moonlight belatedly scooped the prize. \u201cI have no doubt that the OscarsSoWhite thing played a role in Moonlight\u2019s success,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cBut when it becomes, \u2018Oh, Moonlight only won because of OscarsSoWhite,\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Well, say a film won the top award from this critics\u2019 body, then that same film was the highest-rated film on this website, then it goes on to have one of the 10 highest ratings on Metacritic in the history of the website \u2013 if I told you that same film won best picture, you wouldn\u2019t question it. But if I told you a black film about a gay black boy whose mom is addicted to crack-cocaine won best picture, then you go, \u201cOh, it only won because of diversity,\u2019\u201d he laughs. A new renaissance in black film-making is declared every few years, but this time it feels there\u2019s some truth and momentum to it. As well as Jenkins, in the US there is Ryan Coogler, who directed Black Panther and is working on a sequel; Spike Lee (nominated for his first Oscar last month, for BlacKkKlansman); Training Day director Antoine Fuqua; Ava DuVernay (Selma, A Wrinkle In Time); and Jordan Peele (Get Out and the upcoming Us). \u201cI think there\u2019s something about the present moment that is collectively inspiring,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cI don\u2019t think any one of us sees the success of another and feels anything but joy and pride. And I can see that the generation behind us, they see that, and they feed off it. \u201cYou have people like Ava, Ryan and Jordan who are leading by example. Ava did Selma and then created this television show [Queen Sugar], and said every episode was going to be directed by a woman, most of them women of colour. Jordan had massive success with Get Out, and said, \u2018Hey Spike, I\u2019m going to help you make this film\u2019 [BlacKkKlansman, which Peele produced]. When you climb the ladder, you send it back down. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s been happening for the last 10 to 15 years.\u201d He points to technology as another democratising force. \u201cYou see more people from backgrounds that are way outside the core centre, which has always been hetero white American men in the Hollywood system. You can go to any film festival in the world right now, and there are so many people just \u2013 not waiting, because waiting\u2019s the wrong word, but who are going to get put on one way or the other. And your ass is going to get left behind if you\u2019re not hiring these people.\u201d Dear British film industry, again, please take note. I tell Jenkins I look forward to the day when the list of British black film-makers who have been entrusted to make hits is as long as the American one. But the director says he has always admired the European system of financing films. \u201cHere are the funds: you don\u2019t have to really worry about the commercial prospects because it\u2019s not private money, it\u2019s public money, and so it\u2019s just about the art. Stateside, it\u2019s almost impossible to raise the funds to make a movie like Steve McQueen\u2019s Hunger, and to make it in that style.\u201d Even so, I say, the US seems more awake to the talents of a generation of British actors and film-makers: Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Amma Asante, John Boyega, Aml Ameen, Naomie Harris \u2013 all of whom have followed the likes of Idris Elba to work Stateside, and who can blame them? How many more times can they play a stabbing victim on Casualty? But Jenkins doesn\u2019t want to overstate the opportunities the US has to offer, especially now. \u201cWe were moving in this direction where we were trying to eradicate borders, and now we\u2019re trying to build them again,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to think about how we went from the election of Barack Obama to the election of a reality TV star with a heinous past. There were many millions of people who voted for this guy, and I\u2019m trying to understand why that is. What was it about the present moment that made them feel, \u2018This is a direction I don\u2019t want the country to go in? This is the direction I want the country to go in.\u2019 Borders and lies and fake this and xenophobic that.\u201d He sighs. Instead, Jenkins thinks there are reasons to be positive about black British culture right now \u2013 and that a change is coming soon. He gives an example. Just over a year ago, he was in London and looking for a quiet place to write. He went to Soho House and, spotting Daniel Kaluuya in a corner, went over to say hello before starting work. \u201cI was there writing for four or five hours, and there were all these young black men who just kept coming in and sitting down with Daniel. I recognised one of them, Kibwe Tavares, who directed Jonah, which Daniel starred in. This was at the height of Get Out and Daniel was having all these meetings with young black UK directors. And just from watching the demeanour of it, I could tell he was like, \u2018What are you working on? What\u2019s going on? How can we build?\u2019 And so, this shit\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s going to happen.\u201d \u2022 If Beale Street Could Talk is out now.

      "body": "<p>There is something more comforting than luxury spa trips, or even indulgent massages. Something that soothes bones, costs (almost) no money, boosts the mood and makes the nights softer and the mornings lighter. Fresh bedding: clean, taut sheets, plumped pillows, the crinkle of a rejuvenated duvet cover.</p> <p>As an insomniac, I look to any possible positive source of influence for a good night\u2019s sleep. Exercise often doesn\u2019t cut it; neither does banishing caffeine. And I cannot tell you the number of lavender-scented candles I\u2019ve bought. The one thing that does, occasionally, seem to help is a ceremonial changing of the bedding.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t reward without effort. In the winter months, drying sheets slide from too-small radiators, or hang like bright-coloured ghosts from racks. Before I change my duvet cover, I am tempted to text friends to warn them that, if they don\u2019t hear from me for three days, they must send help. (Sometimes I have to clamber in; I have learned that I would be good at caving.) I am also not convinced one qualifies as an adult while still using fitted sheets. Pillow cases, meanwhile, are origami.</p> <p>But, my God, it\u2019s worth it. There is nothing better than the satisfaction of smoothing the top sheet until wrinkle-free \u2013 an experience I imagine akin to a painter shrinking their canvas or a labourer pushing a trowel across wet concrete.</p> <p>Don\u2019t just take my word for it. Research shows \u2013 even that not commissioned by publicists for homeware companies \u2013 that clean bedding improves your sleep. A 2012 study by the US National Sleep Foundation found that 73% of us sleep better on fresh sheets.

      "bodyText": "There is something more comforting than luxury spa trips, or even indulgent massages. Something that soothes bones, costs (almost) no money, boosts the mood and makes the nights softer and the mornings lighter. Fresh bedding: clean, taut sheets, plumped pillows, the crinkle of a rejuvenated duvet cover. As an insomniac, I look to any possible positive source of influence for a good night\u2019s sleep. Exercise often doesn\u2019t cut it; neither does banishing caffeine. And I cannot tell you the number of lavender-scented candles I\u2019ve bought. The one thing that does, occasionally, seem to help is a ceremonial changing of the bedding. This isn\u2019t reward without effort. In the winter months, drying sheets slide from too-small radiators, or hang like bright-coloured ghosts from racks. Before I change my duvet cover, I am tempted to text friends to warn them that, if they don\u2019t hear from me for three days, they must send help. (Sometimes I have to clamber in; I have learned that I would be good at caving.) I am also not convinced one qualifies as an adult while still using fitted sheets. Pillow cases, meanwhile, are origami. But, my God, it\u2019s worth it. There is nothing better than the satisfaction of smoothing the top sheet until wrinkle-free \u2013 an experience I imagine akin to a painter shrinking their canvas or a labourer pushing a trowel across wet concrete. Don\u2019t just take my word for it. Research shows \u2013 even that not commissioned by publicists for homeware companies \u2013 that clean bedding improves your sleep. A 2012 study by the US National Sleep Foundation found that 73% of us sleep better on fresh sheets. (And also that our romantic lives improve.) I am cynical about advertising, but the women I truly believe in (and they are always women) are those who act in the fabric softener and detergent ads, who bury their noses in their queen-size beds with all the abandon of a clubber hoovering up a massive line of cocaine. It\u2019s also true that different people\u2019s beds smell different according to the washing powder they use.

As much as we in England know that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/26/chris-ashton-england-south-africa-france\" title=\"\">France are well aware of it too </a>after he smashed all those records last season. That brings a fear factor for the French.</p> \n<p>I spoke to him a couple of months ago and he was explaining how he almost has an algorithm for scoring tries. They all tend to come from a similar position and what he does so well is chase gain-line players. Look at all the tries he has scored over the years, they are all off the back of momentum.</p> \n<p>Northampton in their pomp had Samu Manoa, Soane Tonga\u2019uiha and Courtney Lawes smashing over the gain line; Ashton goes to Saracens \u2013 exactly the same \u2013 he then goes to Toulon, exactly the same. He looks for the holes being created and has an unbelievable knack of finding them. If England can give him the platform he will score tries.</p> \n<p>Nowell also pays the price for just how consistently good Jonny May has been for a while now. Again, his try-scoring rate stands comparison with anyone else\u2019s and he was just so reliable against Ireland. He has quietly become world-class \u2013 you can talk about Jacob Stockdale or Rieko Ioane but if May was wearing black we would be constantly raving about just how good he is.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>How will Nowell be feeling?

      "bodyText": "Eddie Jones is the ultimate tinkerman. He does not make major changes when England lose but at the same time he always keeps things fresh, even when they have a performance like they did against Ireland. I can\u2019t think of a single time he has named an unchanged team and so it comes as no surprise he has tweaked his side more than expected to play France. You have to feel for Jack Nowell. He was given a golden ticket against Ireland and anyone who is trusted like that must be extremely valuable. Now he has effectively got a match ticket. But ultimately, when you have as much strength as England do on the wings, it comes down to the gameplan. In that respect, Chris Ashton\u2019s selection makes sense. He is a try scorer and England must fancy their chances of pulling France around the park, tiring them out and picking them off. Ashton\u2019s try-scoring record speaks for itself, he is a born finisher and he will not hang out on his wing if he spots the opportunity to run those support lines he is so good at. As much as we in England know that, France are well aware of it too after he smashed all those records last season. That brings a fear factor for the French. I spoke to him a couple of months ago and he was explaining how he almost has an algorithm for scoring tries. They all tend to come from a similar position and what he does so well is chase gain-line players. Look at all the tries he has scored over the years, they are all off the back of momentum. Northampton in their pomp had Samu Manoa, Soane Tonga\u2019uiha and Courtney Lawes smashing over the gain line; Ashton goes to Saracens \u2013 exactly the same \u2013 he then goes to Toulon, exactly the same. He looks for the holes being created and has an unbelievable knack of finding them. If England can give him the platform he will score tries. Nowell also pays the price for just how consistently good Jonny May has been for a while now. Again, his try-scoring rate stands comparison with anyone else\u2019s and he was just so reliable against Ireland. He has quietly become world-class \u2013 you can talk about Jacob Stockdale or Rieko Ioane but if May was wearing black we would be constantly raving about just how good he is. How will Nowell be feeling? Or how will Ellis Genge and Harry Williams be feeling? Just as Jones wants them to. Take Genge and Williams \u2013 they will have come off the pitch, basked in the glory in Dublin and now they are back at their clubs, watching England on the TV this weekend. That keeps them on their toes, but not just those two \u2013 everyone will know that their place in the squad is not safe and that guards against complacency.

A mother of two was stunned to be hit with a demand from the taxman for almost \u00a35,400 \u2013 the vast majority of which was child benefit to which she apparently wasn\u2019t entitled, and must now pay back.</p> <p>Sarah Harris* isn\u2019t the first person to be caught out by the government\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-tax-charge\" title=\"\">high income child benefit charge</a>\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/01/high-earner-tax-penalty-child-benefit-50000-salary-pension\" title=\"\">which affects parents earning more than \u00a350,000 a year</a> \u2013 and she certainly won\u2019t be the last. Log on to money-related web forums and you will find plenty of people posting about how they have suddenly been ordered to pay back large sums.</p> <p>Harris says she is particularly annoyed that HM Revenue &amp; Customs would have known for more than two years that she was potentially liable for this tax charge because her income first went above \u00a350,000 in 2015-16 \u2013 yet no one alerted her to the fact she had been overpaid child benefit. It was she who realised there was an issue and contacted HMRC late last autumn.</p> <p>\u201cBy coming forward and doing the right thing, I\u2019ve actually ended up being penalised,\u201d she told Guardian Money. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a horrible experience, and I wouldn\u2019t want anyone else to go through it.\u201d</p> <p>The high income child benefit charge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/04/child-benefit-proposals-self-assesment-tax\" title=\"\">took effect in January 2013</a> and affects several hundred thousand families. How it works is that child benefit is clawed back via the tax system if either you or your partner have an \u201cadjusted net income\u201d of more than \u00a350,000 (see below).</p> <p>While this regime has been in place for a while, each year sees thousands of people confronting it for the first time \u2013 usually triggered when their earnings have gone above \u00a350,000.</p> <p>The tax charge received a reasonable amount of publicity when it came in, but if you were earning less than \u00a350,000 at that point, it may well have passed you by. That seems to be the case with Harris, a married mother of two children aged nine and seven who works in human resources for a firm of accountants. Back in 2013 she was earning a little over \u00a340,000, and now she earns \u00a370,000.</p> <p>She says the first she knew about the tax charge was towards the end of last year, when she stumbled on a news article online. \u201cI thought, \u2018Hang on, I\u2019d better read this.\u2019 I read it, and I think the colour probably drained out of me,\u201d she recalls.</p> <p>She contacted the child benefit department and cancelled the benefit. HMRC told her she needed to register for self-assessment and complete three years of tax returns \u2013 for 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18 \u2013 which she duly did.</p> <p>She was then shocked to be told she owed \u00a35,379 in total, including interest and penalties. The vast majority of this is child benefit cash that she received during those three years (a family with two children gets \u00a31,788.80 a year).</p> <p>HMRC eventually agreed to lop off \u00a3360 in late payment charges, and Harris paid \u00a31,500 out of her savings on 27 January. In terms of the rest, she says: \u201cThey said they needed it to be repaid over 12 months or sooner, which was quite a significant monthly sum \u2026 Additionally, I was asked whether family could lend me the money or whether I could take out a bank loan\u201d.</p> <p>It was later agreed that \u00a32,840 could be paid back through her PAYE tax code, which means this amount will be taken from her salary in equal instalments over 12 months \u2013 12 lots of \u00a3236, presumably \u2013 on top of the usual deductions. In other words, says Harris, she is \u201closing lots of my pay to HMRC for the next 12 months\u201d.</p> <p>That still leaves \u00a3679 to pay, which she believes HMRC wants \u201cpretty soon\u201d. Harris says she pays attention to the news and considers herself to be financially savvy, but the introduction of the tax charge \u201cgenuinely passed me by\u201d, and also wasn\u2019t on her husband\u2019s radar. \u201cI work full time, I\u2019ve got two young children and I\u2019ve got a very busy life,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cWhat also infuriates me is that despite HMRC receiving my P60 and P11D [the form used to report benefits] in each of the three tax years, I was still not alerted to the overpayment of benefit \u2013 that is, when I could have done something about it sooner and avoided the significant amount of debt that I now have.\u201d Harris has embarked on an appeal against the way she says she was treated.</p> <p>HMRC says information about the tax charge is included in the packs for new parents telling them how to claim child benefit. In addition, the front page of the child benefit application form includes a \u201cprominent message\u201d about the tax charge.</p> <p>\u201cWe also include a flyer with child benefit award letters reminding parents what to do if their income increases over \u00a350,000,\u201d an HMRC spokesman says.</p> <p>Guidance is available online at <a href=\"http://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-tax-charge\" title=\"\">gov.uk/child-benefit-tax-charge</a>. The tax charge is also mentioned as one of the reasons why someone might need to file a tax return on the main self-assessment web landing page, he adds.</p> <p><em>* Not her real name</em></p> <h2>How the tax charge works</h2> <p>The tax charge is 1% of the amount of child benefit for each \u00a3100 of income on a sliding scale between \u00a350,000 and \u00a360,000. For those earning more than \u00a360,000 the charge is 100% \u2013 in effect, they receive no child benefit.</p> <p>In a nutshell, those affected have a choice: carry on receiving child benefit but pay extra tax through the self-assessment system, or give up the benefit and don\u2019t pay.</p> <p>The tax charge is based on your adjusted net income: total taxable income (that is, basic salary plus benefits you get from your job, rental income and so on), minus things such as pension contributions and gift-aided donations to charity.</p> <p>The most obvious way to reduce your adjusted net income is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/sep/28/child-benefit-pension-contributions-higher-earners\" title=\"\">pay more into your pension</a>. Any contributions made into a company or personal pension scheme will reduce the final amount of adjusted net income. For example, you could pay additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) into your occupational scheme.</p>",

Harris says she pays attention to the news and considers herself to be financially savvy, but the introduction of the tax charge \u201cgenuinely passed me by\u201d, and also wasn\u2019t on her husband\u2019s radar. \u201cI work full time, I\u2019ve got two young children and I\u2019ve got a very busy life,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat also infuriates me is that despite HMRC receiving my P60 and P11D [the form used to report benefits] in each of the three tax years, I was still not alerted to the overpayment of benefit \u2013 that is, when I could have done something about it sooner and avoided the significant amount of debt that I now have.\u201d Harris has embarked on an appeal against the way she says she was treated. HMRC says information about the tax charge is included in the packs for new parents telling them how to claim child benefit. In addition, the front page of the child benefit application form includes a \u201cprominent message\u201d about the tax charge. \u201cWe also include a flyer with child benefit award letters reminding parents what to do if their income increases over \u00a350,000,\u201d an HMRC spokesman says. Guidance is available online at gov.uk/child-benefit-tax-charge. The tax charge is also mentioned as one of the reasons why someone might need to file a tax return on the main self-assessment web landing page, he adds. * Not her real name How the tax charge works The tax charge is 1% of the amount of child benefit for each \u00a3100 of income on a sliding scale between \u00a350,000 and \u00a360,000. For those earning more than \u00a360,000 the charge is 100% \u2013 in effect, they receive no child benefit. In a nutshell, those affected have a choice: carry on receiving child benefit but pay extra tax through the self-assessment system, or give up the benefit and don\u2019t pay. The tax charge is based on your adjusted net income: total taxable income (that is, basic salary plus benefits you get from your job, rental income and so on), minus things such as pension contributions and gift-aided donations to charity. The most obvious way to reduce your adjusted net income is to pay more into your pension. Any contributions made into a company or personal pension scheme will reduce the final amount of adjusted net income. For example, you could pay additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) into your occupational scheme.",

Just like its big sister, it has a deceptively light texture and natural look. It takes a tad more blending than Tilbury\u2019s offering, but remains flawless all day. Drew Barrymore\u2019s Flower Beauty has a terrific Full Coverage concealer, \u00a38.99, that blends beautifully, adds a little hydration, and lasts. Wear alone or over its exceptionally good companion foundation.",

And I would suspect they have adequate people on the case, both at the agent and the prosecutor level, to pursue all directions.\u201d Prosecutors will have to make a judgment call about what potential cases to bring, said Sandick, adding: \u201cWhen I was in that office, we were always taught that sometimes the most important cases you have are the ones you don\u2019t indict. Because you made a decision that the evidence wasn\u2019t there. \u201cThese are professional prosecutors, it\u2019s not an inquisition.\u201d The threat of a presidential move against the district, or a similar move out of the justice department, is not likely to deter SDNY, Honig said. \u201cI know southern district is not afraid to have a real dispute, a real disagreement with the Department of Justice and at times prevail,\u201d said Honig. \u201cI think the fact that southern district issued this subpoena tells you that they are able to carry on in a fairly aggressive manner.\u201d",

The rest of my income outgoings go towards \u201chealthy\u201d food items that are not widely available and at a higher cost than usual everyday food produce. Regular prescriptions cost at the maximum about \u00a3120 a month, while acupuncture costs \u00a335 a session and has to be done weekly during flare-ups of my illness. A naturopath [a health practitioner who applies natural therapies] costs \u00a350 per phone consultation, and the drugs can total up to a maximum of \u00a3400 every six to eight weeks. Being ill can mean it was hard to get to the doctor or hospital for an appointment, so sometimes I\u2019d get a taxi or, if I was well enough to drive, then hospital parking can cost \u00a34. Taking a taxi could cost between \u00a315 and \u00a320. Then there\u2019s also the cost of extra washing powder for washing bedding all the time, which meant an increase in my electricity bills. I needed to buy extra clothes because I was cold all the time \u2013 plus heating \u2013 even when the weather was mild. I spent a fortune on prescription drugs that often didn\u2019t work, so I would waste money. The NHS has no system to recycle drugs, so they go to the pharmacy to be thrown away. I have now had this illness for two-and-a-half years, and I haven\u2019t been able to save, as all my earnings are spent. I rent out rooms on Airbnb to generate extra income, which comes to about \u00a3350 a month on average, because it is quite seasonal. One week\u2019s holiday a year is my luxury when I can afford it, and I try to buy decent shoes, but clothes rarely unless they are a necessity. Due to my health, I buy good-quality food and, where possible, I buy organic fish and meat when I can. Every three weeks I get my hair cut, and I have it dyed regularly, which costs about \u00a335 to \u00a360. Beauty products normally cost about \u00a35. My nights out are few and far between, and I sell some of my items on eBay to buy books and cinema tickets or to have brunch with girlfriends. I will have to continue to work past retirement age to repay my mortgage \u2013 probably into my 70s. I will have to revise my pension planning due to my ill-health, and I hope that paying into a pension will provide a decent income in retirement. My future plan is to get well, then work full time, pay off my debt and save money. I have learnt that adversity \u2013 as in the health issues I have had to face \u2013 has helped me to move forward and manage my finances according to my circumstances. I know that it is temporary, which is a blessing.",

Analysis by Cardiff University of 2012 consumption patterns \u2013 which may have changed marginally since then \u2013 found 34% of the electrical energy used for cooking went on kettles, 24% on kitchen hobs, 23% on ovens and 19% on microwaves.

It also points out that \u201cbecause gas is cheaper than electricity, it works out slightly cheaper to boil water on a gas hob than using an electric kettle, as long as you are boiling just the quantity you need and switch off the hob as soon as it has boiled.\u201d Consumers should also buy a more energy-efficient kettle when they replace their old one. But do your homework when it comes to pricey \u201csmart\u201d kettles. In 2016 the Guardian related how data expert Mark Rittman spent 11 hours attempting to get his new hi-tech kettle to boil some water. Which appliances cost most and least to run? Comparison site Energyhelpline reckons a kettle used 10 times a day could cost \u00a369 a year if it\u2019s 3,000W, or \u00a335 if used five times a day, while a dishwasher used for one hour could cost \u00a373 or \u00a3104 depending on whether it\u2019s 1,050W or 1,500W. Other figures include: \u00a310 or \u00a318 for an iron used for one hour a week (1,000W/1,800W); \u00a35 or \u00a312 for a vacuum cleaner used for one hour a week (500W/1,200W); and \u00a39 or \u00a317 for a toaster (800W/1,500W); and \u00a314 for a hairdryer (1,000W).",

We are confident that appropriate governance arrangements are now in place relating to the university\u2019s management of the trust, and the designation of the money as a loan has no wider implications for the university\u2019s ongoing financial position.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/nov/23/government-universities-oxford-cambridge-moodys\">Government 'could bail out top universities if in financial danger'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Reading is not in a position to easily repay the \u00a3121m converted into a loan, which would take its debts to \u00a3300m. Its recent financial struggles include large losses from an overseas venture, falling undergraduate student numbers and operating deficits totalling more than \u00a340m over the past two years.</p> <p>Reading achieved university status in 1926, and has grown to have 15,000 students and 4,000 staff, with annual spending of nearly \u00a3350m.

      "bodyText": "A major British university is in a financial and governance crisis, having reported itself to regulators over a \u00a3121m loan. The University of Reading has confirmed to the Guardian that it is investigating whether it improperly benefited from the sale of land belonging to the National Institute for Research in Dairying trust, with the \u00a3121m from the sales having been spent by the university and replaced with the equivalent of IOUs in the trust\u2019s accounts. The university said it had launched an inquiry into a potential conflict of interest and admitted that its actions did not meet the standards of governance expected as the sole trustee of the charity intended to fund agricultural research. Prof Robert Van de Noort, the university\u2019s acting vice-chancellor, said: \u201cOur financial statements set out the handling of the sale of land held by the National Institute for Research in Dairying trust. We are confident that appropriate governance arrangements are now in place relating to the university\u2019s management of the trust, and the designation of the money as a loan has no wider implications for the university\u2019s ongoing financial position.\u201d Reading is not in a position to easily repay the \u00a3121m converted into a loan, which would take its debts to \u00a3300m. Its recent financial struggles include large losses from an overseas venture, falling undergraduate student numbers and operating deficits totalling more than \u00a340m over the past two years. Reading achieved university status in 1926, and has grown to have 15,000 students and 4,000 staff, with annual spending of nearly \u00a3350m. Last year it was ranked 195th in the QS world university rankings, making it the the 26th highest UK university. The revelations are the latest symptom of the financial pressures facing those universities among the losers from the UK\u2019s boom in higher education, fuelled by higher borrowing and lax administration based on over-optimistic forecasts of student numbers. The higher education sector in England already faces looming threats from Brexit cutting off the EU as a source of students, staff and research funding, while a review of funding ordered by Theresa May last year is expected to recommend undergraduate tuition fees be cut from \u00a39,250 a year to less than \u00a37,000. Reading\u2019s precarious balance sheet will be an early test of the Office for Students as the higher education regulator in England. Its chairman, Michael Barber, has publicly declared that the OfS will not bail out struggling universities. Reading said it had informed the Charity Commission and the OfS, and had set up two teams with separate legal representation to attempt to unravel the complex issues involving the university\u2019s potential conflict of interest as a trustee and beneficiary of the loans. Charity Commission guidance explains: \u201cA conflict of interest exists where there is the possibility that a trustee\u2019s personal or wider interests could influence the trustee\u2019s decision-making.\u201d A spokesperson for the OfS said that the matter had been reported by Reading, and that it could not comment on the substance. The OfS is the principal regulator of English higher education charities, which are exempt from registration with the Charity Commission but must still comply with charity law. The OfS is able to notify the commission if it has concerns and ask it to open a statutory inquiry. The trust\u2019s assets come from the National Institute for Research in Dairying, founded at Reading by the Board of Agriculture in 1912 and moved to Shinfield near Reading in 1921. In 1985 the institute was closed and its assets passed to the trust, with the university as the sole beneficiary and trustee. According to Reading\u2019s accounts: \u201cThe trust aims to promote and develop high-quality research into agriculture or food (whether its production or otherwise) at the University of Reading.\u201d Offering a loan to its sole trustee on terms that Reading has not disclosed potentially go beyond the trust\u2019s remit. The university applied for planning permission to build 1,300 homes on the trust\u2019s land known as Shinfield West, although it eventually sold the property to developers for \u00a3100m. The land sales and loans occurred under the leadership of Reading\u2019s previous vice-chancellor, Sir David Bell, one of the country\u2019s most prominent educationalists, who was formerly permanent secretary at the Department for Education and the chief inspector of schools as head of Ofsted. In August last year it was announced that Bell was leaving Reading, to become vice-chancellor at the University of Sunderland. Reading was already in a precarious financial position before the discovery. The university has posted operating deficits of \u00a322m and \u00a319m in its accounts for the last two years. As well as the \u00a3121m owed to the trust, the university owes a further \u00a3180m to external creditors, including a privately placed bond and loans from Barclays and HSBC. The external debts alone come to about 60% of Reading\u2019s annual income, double the average level among English universities. Adding the \u00a3121m pushes the total to 100% of the university\u2019s income. The university has struggled to hit its undergraduate recruitment targets, with last September\u2019s intake down by 650. A campus partnership in Malaysia that was meant to allow Reading to expand into a lucrative overseas market has instead been a loss-maker, forcing the university to write off \u00a327.6m in its last accounts. Staff were informed in January that a voluntary redundancy scheme was opening as the university sought to cut costs and staff. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said there was a real risk that staff and students would be victims of a free-market experiment in higher education. \u201cGiven the consequences not just to the education system but local economies and communities if a major university goes bankrupt and closes its doors, ministers must now make clear what action they intend to take to avoid this happening,\u201d Rayner said. Reading is not alone in its financial woes. Several universities are reported to have needed bridging finance last year, while at least one was given a short-term loan by the regulator to cover cashflow problems.",

Three of the most expensive homes in the world have been sold recently to one man, American financier Ken Griffin, who has become known for spending his fortune on lavish properties in some of the world\u2019s most glamorous cities. All of the latest properties have been eulogised as stunning. Two of the houses are in central London, and will attract taxes that will be banked by central rather than local government. One, a penthouse currently under construction, will overlook Buckingham Palace at Hyde Park Corner as part of the Peninsula London development and will cost \u00a3100m. Another is a townhouse across the park at Carlton Gardens, costing \u00a395m. The third is a penthouse atop a \u201cpencil tower\u201d at New York\u2019s 220 Central Park South, costing $238m (\u00a3200m). In the US federal system, New York City levies the taxes due on property purchases and will receive $217,000 a year from Griffin\u2019s New York purchase, according to calculations by property tax consultants MGNY Consulting. However, in the UK, most of the taxes due on Griffin\u2019s two latest purchases will end up going to central government, aside from the \u00a32,842 per year in council taxes due to Westminster council and the Greater London Authority for both properties. Griffin appears to be facing a UK bill in the region of \u00a330m in stamp duty for the privilege of being a double neighbour to the Queen, but this one-off sum is paid to central government via HM Revenue &amp; Customs. Griffin, 50, is reportedly worth $8.8bn thanks to the success of his Citadel hedge fund. Depending on how he structures the purchases of his two new UK homes, he may also face other charges. If the properties are acquired via a company, there will be an annual tax on enveloped dwelling (ATED) of \u00a3232,000 a year per property, which is also paid to central government. However, housing experts say very few residential properties are now acquired through companies, since the introduction of this charge. ATED applies to high-value UK residential property owned indirectly on, or acquired after, 1 April 2013, by \u201cnon-natural persons\u201d (NNPs). A spokesman for the Local Government Association, which represents 370 English and Welsh councils, said: \u201cLocal government in England faces an overall funding gap of \u00a38bn by 2025. The UK is one of the most centralised economies in the western world. \u201cIf local areas are given freedom and control over their own finances, and the responsibility for growing their local economies, they will be able to take on increasing and enhanced leadership roles for their place.\u201d He added that local authorities should be allowed to retain a proportion of nationally collected taxes paid by their residents \u201csuch as income tax or stamp duty, along with appropriate redistribution arrangements and control over discounts and reductions where appropriate\u201d. In the US federal system of government, property taxes can be levied locally. New York City says that property taxes represented 44% of all \u201ccity tax dollars\u201d collected in the year to 30 June 2018. Of the total city tax take, New York spends 30% on \u201cuniform agencies\u201d including the police, fire and prisons; 30% on education; 19% on health and welfare; and 21% on \u201cother agencies\u201d, which includes housing and transport. In the UK, the financial position of local councils has long been a topic of concern, particularly since austerity budgets were imposed after the global financial crisis. This has resulted in scores of councils complaining that services are having to be cut, and finding themselves struggling to balance the books. In November, the government in effect bailed out Tory-run Northamptonshire county council after giving it unprecedented permission to spend up to \u00a360m of cash received from the sale of its HQ on funding day-to-day services. Northamptonshire declared itself effectively bankrupt in February 2018 after it realised it could not balance its books. It declared insolvency again in July after a review revealed it had understated the extent of its financial problems. It must make good a \u00a370m deficit by the end of March to avoid insolvency for a third time. The recent purchases are only the latest in Griffin\u2019s global shopping spree for glamorous homes. During recent years, he has reportedly spent more than $750m on homes in Chicago, New York, Florida and now London. Griffin earned around $1.4bn in in 2017, according to financial publisher Institutional Investor. He has now set six housing price records, according to US broadcaster CNBC. Last year, he paid the highest price ever for a home in Chicago, buying the top four floors of a Gold Coast condo tower for $58.5m. The \u201ctaxable value\u201d for Griffin\u2019s new Manhattan property comes in at around $1.7m, which is then taxed at a rate of 12.6%. The resulting annual tax bill is slightly lower than the $280,000 projected by developers back in 2015, but it should still be a notable tax boost to local New York City services.

He would use his platform to advocate for immigrant rights, not only as an immigrant himself, but also as a chef who knew how, from farm to table, immigrants are often involved with every step of a meal.</p> <p>These days, he walks the halls of Congress, preaching the message to \u201cbuild longer tables, shorter walls\u201d, but his relationship with the current decision-makers in the White House is weaker than it was under presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama.</p> <p>In 2015, Andr\u00e9s pulled out of a plan to open one of his restaurants in Trump\u2019s hotel in Washington because of the president\u2019s hateful rhetoric towards immigrants on the campaign trail.

It just so happens that at this moment, it is being led by one of the most powerful people in the world. \u201cHe [Trump] is not bringing out the best in all of us, he is bringing out the worst in some of us,\u201d Andr\u00e9s said.</p> <p>Andr\u00e9s said anti-immigrant sentiment, in Europe and the US, is rife with illogic. From a purely practical standpoint, Andr\u00e9s said people should understand that helping the poor and addressing the root causes of immigration would enrich everyone. \u201cThe delusion of comfort of our lives is only temporary,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He has seen firsthand, over and over again, how quickly people\u2019s lives can be upended, during his personal travels and in his work with World Central Kitchen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b58211bed210802f2438bd07210411b0aee9f9b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b58211bed210802f2438bd07210411b0aee9f9b4/0_0_7344_4588/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Celebrity Chef and Restaurateur Jose Andres visiting Haiti.World Central Kitchen constructed this building on the grounds of the Saint Andre de Palmis Tempe school with a kitchen where students and teachers use for learning as well as their cafeteria.

      "bodyText": "A nonstop stream of people of different ages, races and genders gawked, high-fived or chatted excitedly to chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s as he attempted to pose for pictures in the last shreds of daylight earlier this week in Washington, DC. One woman didn\u2019t know his name but did know he was the man she had seen on television feeding federal workers during the government shutdown. A heap of praise spilled from her mouth and she asked if she could simply shake Andr\u00e9s\u2019s hand. Another person asked if Andr\u00e9s would run for president. Some shouted \u201cthank you,\u201d others \u201cgreat job!\u201d and one young man simply muttered \u201clegend\u201d as he walked by. Andr\u00e9s practically owned the block where he stood \u2013 within walking distance were five of the 31 restaurants in his empire \u2013 but these days his fame is more about the hundreds of ham and cheese sandwiches he puts together in disaster zones than the sea urchin set in a droplet of clarified ham stock in his two-Michelin-starred restaurant, minibar. It\u2019s the humanitarian work that has landed Andr\u00e9s a nomination for the Nobel peace prize. In 2010, Andr\u00e9s founded the not-for-profit World Central Kitchen, which works to ensure people in crisis zones are being fed. \u201cEven in a rich country like America, we can be very bad at managing a tragedy like Katrina or Maria,\u201d Andr\u00e9s told the Guardian in an interview at his office, referring to some of the US\u2019s worst hurricanes. Every surface is so cluttered with trinkets that a sword gifted to him by the people of La Mancha, Spain, rests on top of the couch. He continued: \u201cI think we are always in this crazy battle about what\u2019s the right price to keep people safe.\u201d Andr\u00e9s is from Asturias in northern Spain, a region famous for its dairy produce and apple cider. He moved to the US in 1991 after training under his close friend, the founder of El Bulli, Ferran Adri\u00e0. In the next two decades, he collected accolade after accolade for cooking, became a television star chef in both his native and adopted country and was credited with helping popularize tapas in the US. With a network of respected restaurants in DC, Andr\u00e9s found he had an indirect audience with politicians. He would use his platform to advocate for immigrant rights, not only as an immigrant himself, but also as a chef who knew how, from farm to table, immigrants are often involved with every step of a meal. These days, he walks the halls of Congress, preaching the message to \u201cbuild longer tables, shorter walls\u201d, but his relationship with the current decision-makers in the White House is weaker than it was under presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama. In 2015, Andr\u00e9s pulled out of a plan to open one of his restaurants in Trump\u2019s hotel in Washington because of the president\u2019s hateful rhetoric towards immigrants on the campaign trail. The Trump Organization sued Andr\u00e9s, who sued them back. It ended in a settlement with both parties saying they resolved their differences \u201cas friends\u201d. Andr\u00e9s said Trump\u2019s rhetoric around immigration was smart as a tactic: \u201cHe understands there is a very simple way to unify those people that feel alone, that feel forgotten and where you find an enemy it is easier to understand your lack of success.\u201d This \u201cus versus them\u201d mentality has always plagued society, Andr\u00e9s noted. It just so happens that at this moment, it is being led by one of the most powerful people in the world. \u201cHe [Trump] is not bringing out the best in all of us, he is bringing out the worst in some of us,\u201d Andr\u00e9s said. Andr\u00e9s said anti-immigrant sentiment, in Europe and the US, is rife with illogic. From a purely practical standpoint, Andr\u00e9s said people should understand that helping the poor and addressing the root causes of immigration would enrich everyone. \u201cThe delusion of comfort of our lives is only temporary,\u201d he said. He has seen firsthand, over and over again, how quickly people\u2019s lives can be upended, during his personal travels and in his work with World Central Kitchen. The aid group was born out of Andr\u00e9s\u2019s trip to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake that left between 46,000 and 85,000 people dead. He had witnessed poverty in favelas in Rio de Janeiro and in slums in Nairobi, but the way cheaply constructed buildings had left Haiti in rubble had a profound impact on him. World Central Kitchen helped get food and water to Haitians and supported long-term projects to improve school kitchens and conduct food safety training. For the next few years, they quietly did work in Brazil, Peru and Cambodia. Then, Hurricane Maria happened. It\u2019s not often that a ham and cheese sandwich instills hope into millions of people, but in the days after Hurricane Maria, when apocalyptic scenes greeted Puerto Rico\u2019s 3.5 million residents, a pile of sandwiches with a hearty dose of mayonnaise did just that. The federal government was slow to respond to the September 2017 hurricane that knocked out the US island territory\u2019s power grid, and aid agencies struggled to overcome bureaucratic red tape and gas shortages to get desperately needed supplies across the island. Then, suddenly, news of World Central Kitchen\u2019s meal operation emerged on social media. Andr\u00e9s and his team had mobilized chefs, fought to obtain food and hunted down a functioning kitchen on the island. For two weeks in October, they made 120,000 to 150,000 meals a day. By late June 2018, World Central Kitchen had cooked more than 3.6m meals in Puerto Rico. \u201cI took it like it was my problem, it was my mission,\u201d Andr\u00e9s said. \u201cNobody named me \u2013 nobody told me \u2018you are the food tsar\u2019 and maybe sometimes I sound crazy when I mention this, but I wouldn\u2019t mind if they told me: \u2018you are the food tsar.\u2019\u201d Andr\u00e9s is very critical of the bureaucracy that slowed aid efforts and last year published a book, We Fed an Island, a pointed critique of the response to Maria. Now if there is a crisis in the news, there is probably a swift group chat on Andr\u00e9s\u2019s phone about how to get food there. In 2018, they served more than 3m meals in Puerto Rico, California, Hawaii, Guatemala, Indonesia, North Carolina, Florida and Mexico after various catastrophes. It\u2019s not just about preparing a bowl of rice and beans or handing out bottled water, but about finding people who need help, and creating an infrastructure to get them food and supplies, he explained. It\u2019s about finding what went wrong in the first place and how they can help a population so the next time a hurricane rolls around, its entire local food economy won\u2019t be decimated. In Puerto Rico, World Central Kitchen no longer serves thousands of meals a day, but has provided grants to local farmers in an effort to steer the island from its import-heavy food economy. People stop Andr\u00e9s on the street for this work, but also for the way he has called out the president and other people in power in Puerto Rico and during the shutdown for failing to address the impact their actions had on people\u2019s livelihoods. Most of that commentary happens on Twitter. In September, Trump challenged reports that the death toll in Puerto Rico was thousands more than estimated. \u201cThat People die is a fact!

      "bodyText": "Peak District Legal protection of England and Wales\u2019 national parks began with a law passed by the post-war Labour government that also created the NHS. The 1932 mass trespass at Kinder Scout in the Peak District helped bring about the 1949 National Parks Act, and two years later the upland area was designated Britain\u2019s first national park. It embraces five counties, receives 13.25 million visitors a year and is a walker\u2019s Shangri-La. The massive moors and gritstone crags of the northern Dark Peak are impressive, but it\u2019s the White Peak\u2019s limestone dales and wooded gorges that are most appealing for weekending families in spring. Begin in Bakewell \u2013 its famous puddings are even tastier after a day\u2019s adventures \u2013 and get your bearings at the visitor centre in its 17th-century Old Market Hall. Then make for Over Haddon, 10 minutes away by car or bus, to explore lovely Lathkill Dale. Footpaths run beside the river, with cascades and deep blue pools populated by little black-and-white short-tailed birds called dippers. Nearby is stately Chatsworth House (adult \u00a323, child \u00a314.50), open for February half-term and then fully open from 23 March, when there will be banks of yellow daffodils around the lake. There\u2019s a Little Explorers trail to follow around its 105 acres. Drive on another half-hour to the village of Castleton, with its ruined 11th-century Peveril Castle and its caves. Take an underground boat ride through Speedwell Cavern (adult \u00a312, 5-15s \u00a310), a centuries-old lead mine with a subterranean lake known as the Bottomless Pit. A joint ticket with nearby Peak Cavern lets you into a cave called the Devil\u2019s Arse, which should appeal to most children. Diary date: 16-24 February Chatsworth\u2019s petting farm (\u00a36.50 adult or child) has a piratical theme this half-term, with tricornes and parrots, water blasting and galleon sailing. There are also tractor trailer rides and, for those who dare, the chance to handle snakes and spiders; more sensitive souls might be happier with the lambs, goats and guinea pigs. Stay Hartington Hall youth hostel (family rooms from \u00a335) is a 17th-century manor with wood panels and open fires, on the edge of pretty Hartington village in the south of the park. South Downs England\u2019s newest national park runs from St Catherine\u2019s Hill in Winchester to the white cliffs of the Seven Sisters near Eastbourne. As well as the 100 miles of the South Downs Way, there are lots of other great walks here. From the car park or bus stop at the site of the ancient village of Exceat, there\u2019s a choice of a 3\u00bd-mile walk to the Seven Sisters cliffs, a seven-mile trek to Eastbourne or \u2013 the family favourite \u2013 a gentle grassy stroll along the meandering river to rockpool-rich Cuckmere Haven. Kite flyers make for Ditchling Beacon near Brighton. This highest point in East Sussex has a classic 360-degree view, encompassing the wide fields and farms of the weald and the sparkle of the sea. As well as kites, there are likely to be colourful paragliders launching from nearby Devil\u2019s Dyke and floating over the green slopes below. Stroll along South Downs Way to reach the twin Jack and Jill windmills a mile and a half away. The next day, head west to the retro rides and craft workshops of Amberley Museum (adult \u00a313.60, 5-15s \u00a38, open at half-term then from 6 March). It\u2019s in an old chalk quarry, with a narrow-gauge railway and vintage open top bus providing living transport history, and a historic print shop gives hands-on lessons in communication. Diary date: 16-24 February The Sussex Puddle Jumping championships reward the biggest, splashiest jumps, as recorded by Arundel Wetland Centre\u2019s Splashometer (adult \u00a310.88, 4-16s \u00a35.85). Stay YHA South Downs near Lewes is a converted farmhouse with huge garden and a courtyard cafe (family rooms from \u00a359). Or base yourself in West Sussex at YHA Littlehampton on the revamped Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, handy for the beach and not far from Arundel\u2019s Castle and Wetland Centre (family rooms from \u00a349). Brecon Beacons A hilly adventure playground, the heathery Brecon Beacons offer walks and canal trips, waterfalls, caves and a town full of books. Kick off in Brecon itself on the park\u2019s northern edge, picking up picnic supplies in the market and ice-creams from Llanfaes Dairy, just outside town. Take a boat trip (from March) along the Monmouthshire and Brecon canal with Dragon Fly cruises (adult \u00a37.80, under-16 \u00a34.50), crossing the River Usk on a 19th-century stone aqueduct. For walkers, short Down to the Sea family trails along the canal encourage kids to engage with the area\u2019s industrial history. The first one leads from Brecon to the old waterside limekilns. Head for the visitor centre at Libanus, 10 minutes away, to get a small taste of the huge landscapes: a 2\u00bd-mile waymarked walk takes in the iron age hillfort at Twyn y Gaer, with mountain views. Book ahead for stargazing events at Libanus, where the Milky Way is visible on clear nights; Dark Sky Wales, which runs them, has a blow-up planetarium to guarantee stars even when it\u2019s cloudy. The Dan-yr-Ogof show caves (adult \u00a315, 3-16s \u00a312, 1 April-3 November) offer half a mile of underground passageways, the monumental Cathedral Cave and a chance to walk behind a waterfall. There are also hundreds of huge model dinosaurs, a Shire Horse Centre and an Iron Age village. Diary date: 23 May-2 June Book ahead for events at Hay Festival (tickets from \u00a35, some free tickets for students) which brings world-class writers to the edge of the Brecons every May, with lots of activities for kids of all ages. Stay Brecon Beacons YHA is a converted whitewashed Victorian farmhouse soth-west of Brecon in the heart of the national park, with en suite family rooms (from \u00a345) and fabulous views of Pen y Fan \u2013 the Brecons\u2019 highest peak at 886 metres. Pembrokeshire Coast The only dedicated coastal park, surrounded on three sides by sea, Pembrokeshire was named 2018 holiday destination of the year by Countryfile. The rugged cliffs and sandy beaches are generally emptier and the country lanes less choked with holiday traffic than honeypot destinations like Cornwall. The coast path offers spectacular hikes on headlands fringed with pink thrift. A mile-long taster around Lydstep has views of arches, coves and blowholes along the rocky coast to Skrinkle Haven. The grassy cliffs are full of spring flowers and butterflies; below, 100 steps lead at low tide to the beach, rock pools and Lydstep Caverns. Next day, drive an hour north-west to Britain\u2019s smallest city \u2013 St Davids \u2013 and take a boat trip to Ramsey Island (adult \u00a326, 4-16s \u00a314, under 4s \u00a35, from February half-term, weather dependent). Look out for seals, porpoises and guillemots and, later in the year, cute, ungainly puffins. Over-eights can go coasteering with Celtic Quest (\u00a345): rock hopping, cave crawling and cliff jumping in an action-packed but unpressured half-day. Winter wet suits, buoyancy aids and more are supplied. Manorbier Castle, a dramatic ruin on the nearby cliffs, opens at the end of March (adults \u00a35.50, child \u00a33, family \u00a315. Well-kept Carew Castle is open all year and has a daily treasure hunt around the grounds (adult \u00a34.50, child \u00a33, family\u00a312.50) Diary dates: 25 February, 13 March, 15 April The National Trust is running a Big Beach Clean Challenge at Freshwater West on the above dates (litter-pickers provided). There are often great surfers to watch too, (national championships are held here) and Harry Potter fans might recognise the beach from the Deathly Hallows films. Stay Most Pembrokeshire hostels open in March; for spectacular views and seal-spotting, book well ahead to stay in YHA Poppit Sands (family room from \u00a345) at the northern tip of the national park. With gardens stretching to sandy beaches, you hardly need to go anywhere else (which is handy as the car park is 10 minutes away). To be more in the thick of things, try YHA Manorbier, a former military base also overlooking the sea (family rooms from \u00a335). Northumberland Upland streams, ancient woods, hay meadows and blanket bogs stitch together Northumberland\u2019s patchwork of habitats in England\u2019s most northerly national park. Hadrian\u2019s Wall, a Unesco world heritage site, runs along the southern edge of the park and the Sill Discovery Centre makes a great base for exploring, with interactive exhibition, family astronomy evenings, and a brand new hostel (family rooms from \u00a339) with the turrets and milecastles of Hadrian\u2019s Wall marching across the horizon above you. It\u2019s an easy one-mile walk from the hostel to the wall\u2019s highest point at blustery Winshield Crags, where kids can pretend to be a Roman soldier or invading Pict, Horrible Histories style. Or follow a four-mile circuit via Sycamore Gap with its iconic lone tree. Head back for local beer and sticky toffee pudding at the Twice Brewed Inn near Bardon Mill. Nearby Housesteads is Britain\u2019s most complete Roman fort, once home to a regiment of 800 soldiers (adult \u00a37.80, 5-17s \u00a34.70). Children will enjoy dressing up as a legionary, laughing at the communal loos and running around the wide open spaces. The museum has Roman tools, jewellery and weapons, and a winged statue of victory. Spring is the time for spotting red squirrels, before the trees get too leafy. The lovely three-mile wooded walk to Hareshaw Linn waterfall, crossing six bridges, is a great place to try \u2013 and also look out for woodpeckers and warblers among the mossy trees and lichen-covered branches. Diary date: 16 March Imaginative kids (and their grown-up helpers) will love a morning or afternoon Mythical Beast Making activity (\u00a35pp) at the Sill Discovery Centre. The session starts with a wander through the trees for inspiration before moving on to painting and junk modelling. Yorkshire Dales Established in 1954, the Yorkshire Dales national park covers more than 800 beautiful square miles of North Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumbria. Limestone crags and wooded slopes segue into wildflower meadows, drystone walls and deep valleys. For an introduction to life here through the centuries, the Dales Countryside Museum (\u00a34.80, under-16s free), in the old railway station at Hawes, charts local history from bronze age spears and Viking jewellery to lead mines and steam trains. Next, head 20 minutes east to Aysgarth Falls, where the woods are bright with bluebells in April, a series of waterfalls cascade through the valley, and a short, rewarding walk leads to views of 14th-century Bolton Castle. The next day, head 30 miles south to go underground at Stump Cross Caverns (adult \u00a38.50, 4-13s \u00a34.95) near Pately Bridge. This is a limestone cave system you can walk through at your own pace and a family quiz (with prizes) involves finding fairy doors. Book ahead online for an even more unusual adventure at The Forbidden Corner near Coverham (adult \u00a312.50, 4-15s \u00a310.50, from late March), an oddball labyrinth of tunnels, walkways and secret gardens. Diary date: 20 February Wrap up warm and meet at Aysgarth Falls national park centre at 5.30pm for a lantern-lit procession through the woods. If you don\u2019t have a lantern, just bring a torch. No need to book (child \u00a33, adult free), and there\u2019s hot chocolate and snacks for kids at the Coppice Caf\u00e9 afterwards. Stay YHA Grinton Lodge (family rooms from \u00a325) is in wild, unspoilt Swaledale, 10 minutes\u2019 walk from Grinton village with its friendly riverside Bridge Inn. (The Tan Hill, England\u2019s highest pub, which also has rooms, is at the far end of the valley.) The hostel is a castellated former hunting lodge with a fire in the lounge and heated log cabins in the grounds. New Forest With its heaths and bogs, fields, farms and coast, the New Forest is a rich tapestry of habitats. Look out for bats and butterflies, deer and donkeys, and all six of the UK\u2019s native snakes and lizards. There are no mountains here, though, so its excellent terrain for cycling. Hire bikes all year round from Cycle Experience (from \u00a318.50 a day) by Brockenhurst station and head for the woods or seaside. For little legs, choose a simple trail through Blackwater arboretum, three miles away. A short drive (or 10-mile bike ride) away is the village of Beaulieu, with cows and ponies wandering the lanes and grazing by Hatchet pond. The Beaulieu Estate (adult from \u00a319.50, 5-16s \u00a39.50) has the National Motor Museum (1920s Sunbeams, record-breaking Bluebird Proteus and so on), stately home, ruined abbey, monorail rides and more. A new two-mile path runs from Beaulieu through riverside woods to Buckler\u2019s Hard, where Nelson\u2019s warships were built. This village, with its waterside pub and picnic spots, also has a year-round maritime museum (adult from \u00a36.90, 5-16s \u00a35.20). Across the river, Exbury Gardens (adult from \u00a312.50, child \u00a34) is 100 years old this year and opens from 23 March. Kids can play hide and seek in a jungle of rhododendrons, watch the giant carp in the maple-lined pond, and ride a miniature railway (\u00a35 extra). Diary date: 21 April Families with kids over eight can pack a picnic (plus marshmallows for toasting) and brush up their bushcraft among the bracken and pine trees on a Woodland Adventure Day (adult \u00a360, under-16s \u00a325) on the Beaulieu Estate. Participants light a fire, build a den, shoot a bow and explore high rope challenges. Stay YHA New Forest (family rooms from \u00a339) at Burley is a converted country house with bluebells in the garden and heated camping pods for four, as well as family rooms. Lake District England\u2019s largest national park covers more than 900 square miles, with no fewer than 16 lakes and attracts huge numbers of visitors. To escape the crowds, begin in the village of Glenridding by Ullswater. Catch a steamer across the lake to Aira Force waterfall, with its tree trail, then walk back along a three-mile stretch of the Ullswater Way, through the woods where William Wordsworth\u2019s host of golden daffodils still dance each spring. Then drive south to the wide waters of Windermere and call at Brockhole, the Lake District\u2019s official visitor centre, where (for free) the kids can scramble under nets, race through tunnels and zip down wires. There are rowing boats or kayaks to rent (from \u00a315 an hour) for a Swallows and Amazons adventure among the wooded islands. You can rent bikes here too and take them on Bowness ferry to Windermere\u2019s quieter western shore. Next day, take the 555 bus to Keswick on one of Britain\u2019s most beautiful routes, running for an hour by the shores of Windermere, Rydal Water, Grasmere and dreamy Thirlmere. Don\u2019t miss homemade gelato at Casa Bella in Keswick, with 28 flavours from strawberry to honeycomb. And a new attraction, the Windermere Jetty Museum of Boats, Steam and Stories, opens on 23 March. The \u00a320m development will house a collection of 40 vessels and other exhibits, telling the story of boat building in the Lakes. Stay The Lake District has some great youth hostels, though they do get booked up quickly. YHA Keswick has clean, bright family rooms (from \u00a339), with the River Greta murmuring below their balconies. Diary dates: 11 and 19 April Beatrix Potter is big business in the Lakes and the World of Beatrix Potter in Bowness (adult \u00a37.95, child \u00a33.95) holds regular Old Brown Owl Days, with live owls. There are also storytelling sessions, crafts and Peter Rabbit tea parties. North York Moors This huge, wild expanse of heather-covered moorland and windswept coast feels ancient and exhilarating. From magical steam train rides to starry night skies, there\u2019s plenty for families to do. Scenes at Hogsmeade Station in the Harry Potter movies were filmed at Victorian Goathland station, on the North Yorkshire Moors steam railway (open February half-term, then from late March). Returns from Goathland to Grosmont cost \u00a313 adult, \u00a36.50 4-16s \u2013 less if you walk back along the river (allow two hours) with its woods and waterfalls. You don\u2019t have to be Potterites to ride \u2013 you can enjoy the Yorkshire scenery and learn about science at Peter\u2019s Railway Young Engineer\u2019s Centre. Keep up the time-travel theme at Ryedale Folk Museum (adult \u00a38.25, 4-15s \u00a37.25, open daily from 23 February) with its iron age round house, thatched cottages, and working forge. On a sunny day, climb conical Roseberry Topping for fine views, stopping on the way back at the Woolly Sheep cafe in the national park centre in Danby, with adventure playgrounds and a riverside sculpture trail. On a rainy day, hop on a Coastliner bus \u2013 the route between Whitby and York was recently voted Britain\u2019s most scenic bus route. For the best moorland scenery, ride to pretty Thornton-le-Dale and back. Diary date: 15 February-3 March The North York Moors (along with the Dales, South Downs and Northumberland national parks) is taking part in the annual Dark Skies Festival, celebrating the best starry vistas in England with a programme of night walks, bike rides and other experiences. On 28 February there\u2019s a stargazing event (adult \u00a312, under-16s \u00a38, 7-9pm) at Sutton Bank, an hour\u2019s scenic sunset drive from Whitby, with a big telescope for viewing distant galaxies and star clusters, and a planetarium too. Stay The famous YHA in Whitby (family rooms from \u00a339) is in a 16th-century mansion built of golden stone, next door to the ruined abbey (which guests can visit for free). It overlooks Whitby harbour and the view that inspired Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula. Snowdonia Snowdon, Wales\u2019s highest mountain, is the central landmark in the first national park to open in Wales (established 1951). There are six walking routes to the summit, or take the less strenuous mountain railway from Llanberis. It opens mid-March and runs to Clogwyn, three-quarters of the way up (adult \u00a317 return, 3-15s \u00a311). Colourful Portmeirion (adult \u00a38, 5-15s free) close to Porthmadog \u2013 reached on the narrow-gauge Welsh Highland Line from mid-February \u2013 is a jumble of eccentric buildings in pink, turquoise and ochre with a distinctly Mediterranean feel, and subtropical gardens. The many steps mean it\u2019s not pushchair-friendly, but older kids will love running down to the beach at the bottom and getting lost in the woods. Even short walks on the Welsh coast are rewarding. South of Harlech, try a one-mile stretch from Pen-sarn station by the Artro river to Llandanwg, where the church of St Tanwg sits among the marram grass and wildflowers of the dunes. Nearby, a new floating bridge leads to the grey sandstone Harlech Castle (family ticket \u00a320), with towers on a crag above the sea. Then drive or take the train to sandy Barmouth and hire bikes from Birmingham Garage on Church Street. Cycle over the breathtaking Barmouth Bridge, a 152-year-old wooden viaduct that spans the estuary, and follow the level Mawddach Trail towards Dolgellau. Diary date: until 31 March The Centre for Alternative Technology, near Machynlleth on the edge of the park, is waiving its entry fees this winter. Kids can get quite a lot out of the interactive displays about renewable energy, organic gardening and suchlike, as well as enjoying the new quarry trails, play areas and open spaces. Stay Pen-y-Pass hostel (family rooms from \u00a345) is at the foot of Snowdon and has just had a million-pound refurb. Exmoor This national park\u2019s combination of coast and rugged moorland has plenty to keep families busy. Start with a ride on the cliff railway at Lynton, a water-powered funicular climbing through a steep gorge to the clifftop (adult \u00a33.90 return, 4-13s \u00a32.40). Then stroll a mile along the coast path to the spectacular Valley of the Rocks, with its castle-like cliffs. Lunch at the harbourside Bottom Ship Inn in pretty Porlock Weir and try crabbing off the pier with bait bought from seaside shops. Other possibilities include sea kayaking (thick wetsuits and other gear provided, \u00a340pp) or tree climbing, archery and axe throwing on a half-day family activity session with Exmoor Adventures (from \u00a3125 for up to five people). Next day, climb Exmoor\u2019s highest point, Dunkery Beacon. A clear grassy track leads from the car park to panoramic summits half a mile away; Exmoor ponies roam the heather, buzzards wheel overhead and bronze age barrows crown the ancient sandstone slopes. On selected Sundays in March and April there are new lambs to meet at free Lambing talks held by the National Trust\u2019s Horner Farm. Then explore the ancient trees of the surrounding Holnicote Estate (free but parking charge) looking out for reintroduced water voles. From April, the whitewashed heritage centre in Dulverton has, alongside its working model railway, a new exhibition to celebrate 150 years of Richard Blackmore\u2019s evocative Exmoor-based novel Lorna Doone (free). Diary date: 17 April Haddon Hill Big Adventure is a day of bug-hunting, den-building, campfire-cooking for families among the big views and open skies of Haddon Hill in the south-west of the park (free, no booking needed). Stay YHA Minehead, a mile from medieval Dunster with its dramatic ruined castle, has en suite family rooms from \u00a335. Riverside Exford Hostel, right in the middle of the national park, has private family rooms from \u00a376. Dartmoor Arthur Conan Doyle enjoyed Dartmoor\u2019s prehistoric sites and wild moorland, inspiration for The Hound of the Baskervilles, published from 1901. He stayed in Princetown, now the Dartmoor visitor centre, which has Victorian clothes to dress up in. The park is perfect terrain for geocaching and letterboxing, which originated on Dartmoor. Half an hour\u2019s drive away, NT-owned Lydford Gorge (family from \u00a325) has an adventurous fern-fringed walk to the 30-metre Whitelady Waterfall and mossy Devil\u2019s Cauldron. Look out for yellow-bellied grey wagtails near the water. Kid-friendly Cholwell Riding Stables in the village of Mary Tavy offers rides on the moors for those who prefer horseback to feet (from \u00a323 an hour). For more animal magic, Pennywell Farm (\u00a315/\u00a313) across the moors near Buckfastleigh has half-term entertainment plus piglet cuddling, ferret racing and more. The Jolly Roger in nearby Bovey Tracey makes lifesize resin models of everything from Egyptian gods to aliens for theme parks, film producers and ad agencies. Kids are fascinated by its surreal showroom, with haunted house and Disney sections, before heading to Home Farm caf\u00e9 on the edge of the moors for a fresh pasty or savoury cheese cream tea. homefarmcafe.co.uk Diary date: 8-13 April Grapple with the granite on a three-hour rock adventure session (\u00a315pp, all ages) amid Dartmoor\u2019s craggy tors with Princetown-based Crag 2 Mountain. It includes rock climbing, abseiling and \u201cweaselling\u201d though short tunnels. Stay Stone-built YHA Dartmoor, in the shadow of Bellever Tor, has a woodburning stove and family rooms from \u00a390. It sits amid miles of moorland with wild ponies. There are hostels near Okehampton, too. The Broads Wide skies over wild marshes and lonely windmills among echoing fens: the Broads, made up largely of waterways, have a particular beauty quite different from other national parks. Begin at How Hill, near the village of Ludham, with a look round Toad Hole Cottage Museum on the banks of the River Ant to learn how 19th-century marshmen lived. Don\u2019t miss the secret garden and local ice-creams. For a more hands-on activity, take a two-hour family sailing lesson at nearby Hunter\u2019s Yard on a vintage wooden keelboat (\u00a379 for four people). Next day, drive to Beccles, town of faded Georgian brickwork, with a short trail along the winding River Waveney and over the timeless marshes, where sheep have grazed for two millennia and archaeologists have dug up tall, oak posts that once marked a route for Iron Age walkers. Ready for more boating? Hire kayaks or two-person Canadian canoes to explore the backwaters (from \u00a317 for a half day at the Waveney River Centre). If it\u2019s raining, Great Yarmouth is half an hour\u2019s drive away and has one of the UK\u2019s largest Sea Life Centres (adult \u00a316.95, 3-13s \u00a314.95), with sharks, a walk-through underwater tunnel, stingrays, starfish, eels. The Wherry Line railway from Oulton Broad to Norwich train runs by shining waters and waving grass studded with windmills, grazing cows and lazily spinning turbines (adult \u00a38.50, 5-15s \u00a34.25 return). Diary date: 16 March There\u2019s a storytelling session and chance to handle snakes and creepy crawlies on the Curious Critters day at BeWILDerwood woodland park (open Feb half term, weekends in March and daily from 5 April; under 92cm free, 92-105cm \u00a314.95, over 105cm \u00a316.95), plus the huge climbing frames and treetop walkways to explore. Stay There isn\u2019t a YHA anywhere near the park, but Hidden Meadows eco-glamping site (sleeps 6-8, from \u00a3240 for 2 nights) in the village of North Cove has safari tents (with huge beds, heaters, a jug of wildflowers on the wooden table and a tin of homemade cake) set in 25 acres of stream-crossed meadow. There\u2019s also a run of chickens by each tent, so you can cook freshly-laid eggs for breakfast. \u2022 Phoebe Taplin is a freelance journalist and writer; her latest book, Walk York, is out in March (Pitkin, \u00a36) This year\u2019s Easter holidays coincide with the Discover National Parks fortnight, from 6-to21 April, with treasure trails and seaside safaris, guided forest walks and local food",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/12/ella-mai-ella-mai-review-bood-up-singers-rb-statement-of-intent\">Ella Mai</a> knows how to be a pop star, to such an extent that the south London-raised singer\u2019s omnipresent R&amp;B slinker Boo\u2019d Up made her the first British artist since 1992 to top the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/27/ella-mai-becomes-the-first-uk-artist-to-top-the-us-rb-chart-since-1992\">US R&amp;B chart</a>, and has earned her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/07/grammy-nominations-2019-cardi-b-kendrick-lamar-drake-lead\">two Grammy nominations</a> this year. However, she also knows what it is like to be a fan. On tour, her merch stand offers lyric booklets, designed so that streaming-era audiences can relive the endless hours she spent as a teenager devouring the inlays that came with her favourite CDs. After the first night of Ella\u2019s UK tour, she met some of those fans: mostly girls, mostly quite young. One of their mums pulled Ella to one side and said: \u201cThanks for making the time, she\u2019s had a difficult year.\u201d</p> <p>Ella is still thinking of all this the next morning as she sits cross-legged on her hotel bed in her off-duty attire: blue beanie, orange hoodie, big smile. \u201cIt gives me a lot of satisfaction to know girls can look up to me the way I looked up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/01/lauryn-hill-live-birmingham-arena-review-miseducation\">Lauryn Hill</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/04/alicia-keys-i-want-to-make-sure-all-issues-race-hillary-clinton-here-interview\">Alicia Keys</a>,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling to know I can have that impact on someone.\u201d</p> <p>The thing is, I begin \u2013 and even I\u2019m surprised at how early in our interview Captain Buzzkill is making an appearance \u2013 realistically, not all these kids will ever achieve their dreams. They won\u2019t have multiple award nominations, or top a billion streams, or have gold-selling albums, or tour with Bruno Mars. They might continue to have difficult years. \u201cWell,\u201d Ella nods, \u201cthat\u2019s the tough thing. That\u2019s something I\u2019m still figuring out, to be honest.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YNZlXfW6Ho\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6YNZlXfW6Ho?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>If there is one theme that defines Ella Mai\u2019s success, it\u2019s figuring things out as she goes along. In an era defined by the siren\u2019s call of streaming service algorithms, many artists are finding true creativity to be hard work and reward-free; couple that with the fact that the music industry is largely built on happy accidents subsequently passed off as deliberate masterplans, and it is even more refreshing that Ella Mai makes no effort to cast the success of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/aug/02/ella-mai-bood-up-r-and-b-charts-number-1?CMP=twt_gu\">Boo\u2019d Up</a> as remotely premeditated.</p> <p>The reality is that the song, with its very non-2010s nod to early-2000s R&amp;B, had been knocking around in a pile of demos for years. It might, Ella supposes, have been passed over by other artists first; her producer and label boss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/25/dijon-mcfarlane-dj-mustard\">DJ Mustard</a> shares an A&amp;R with Rihanna. In any case, Mustard only dusted off the song when he and Ella were putting the finishing touches to the three EP releases. \u201cMustard just randomly came across it,\u201d Ella remembers. \u201cHe said: \u2018Do you like this?\u2019 I said: \u2018Yeah.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There was no magic or drama to the song\u2019s recording, which took place late at night, because that\u2019s when Ella works best, in a studio with just a recording engineer in attendance. \u201cI know you want to hear an exciting story,\u201d Ella laughs. \u201cIt was just another session. I recorded it, and the EP was done. Such a boring story.\u201d</p> <p>The truth, I offer, is never boring. Neither of us seems particularly convinced. In any case, Ella\u2019s third EP came out, and it went down well with her slowly growing fanbase, built through support slots with acts such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/30/kehlani-review-village-underground\">Kehlani</a>, but none of the EP\u2019s tracks exactly prompted spontaneous international street parties. \u201cWe were still very hopeful,\u201d Ella says today. \u201c[Mustard] never said to me: \u2018I don\u2019t know if what we\u2019re doing is right.\u2019 He\u2019s stuck by his first gut feeling about me. Luckily, it got us somewhere.\u201d</p> <p>It did indeed. Ten months later, a clubber requested Boo\u2019d Up from Bay Area DJ Big Von, who spoke to <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/bood-up-how-ella-mai-is-leading-female-rb-singers-back-onto-the-charts-628233/\">Rolling Stone</a> and summarised the crowd response thusly: \u201cI saw a fat dude do a cartwheel \u2013 a solid cartwheel, he didn\u2019t even fall. Security comes over to me: \u2018What the hell is this?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ee11b0cca114bd7e336d6864324e708bb9d409e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ee11b0cca114bd7e336d6864324e708bb9d409e/1233_0_2910_2910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ella Mai\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The song spread. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsxGaj7PSoI\">Nicki Minaj and Quavo</a> hopped on a remix. Rihanna, far from taking umbrage at Ella, listened along to it on Instagram. By mid-2018, after more than a year, Ella\u2019s slow-burn hit had become inescapable. At one photoshoot last year, Ella was handed a phone, and on the other end of the line was someone who\u2019d just called to say he loved Boo\u2019d: \u201cHe started talking, and I thought, \u2018Hold on \u2026 \u2019 I don\u2019t know who I expected it to be, but I definitely didn\u2019t expect it to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/stevie-wonder-songwriter-bim-adewunmi\">Stevie Wonder</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Last Christmas, Wonder introduced Ella on stage at a charity event where they performed Superstition together, saying: \u201cShe made me want to go home and do some things. And guess what? I did.\u201d Write a song? Defrost the freezer? Hard to say. Either way: \u201cProbably the greatest thing I\u2019ve ever heard in my life,\u201d Ella beams today.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/aug/02/ella-mai-bood-up-r-and-b-charts-number-1\">Ella Mai: the British R&amp;B star loved in the US \u2013 and ignored by the UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All of which would have seemed at best unlikely to the Ella Mai kicking around south-west London hotspots such as Mitcham, Merton and Wimbledon Chase in the early 2000s. Let\u2019s just say, tourists on future Ella Mai sightseeing tours won\u2019t be in for the most exciting afternoon of their lives. (Ella\u2019s summary: \u201cIt\u2019s very residential and then there\u2019s \u2026 nothing.\u201d) She would play football on Saturdays, and on Sundays she\u2019d be in church with her grandmother, a minister in a pentecostal church. Ella\u2019s parents had split when the kids were young; Ella says that when it came to raising Ella and older brother Miles, \u201cmum did all the work\u201d.</p> <p>The names Ella and Miles give a glimpse at the intensity of their mother\u2019s passion for the jazz greats, and Ella\u2019s own tastes broadened with the arrival of her first iPod.</p> <p>When Ella was in year nine, her mum got a job in the States, which took Ella to New York. She hated it there. \u201cAt 13, you\u2019re trying to find yourself anyway,\u201d Ella says today, \u201cbut I felt so different, and I was the only one with an English accent.\u201d Then, there it is again: \u201cI learned to not think about it too much, and try and figure it out as I went along.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually, the family moved back to the UK and Ella scored a place at music college. Somewhere in her mum\u2019s house is an old softback (\u201cbut not flimsy\u201d) Paperchase notebook containing Ella\u2019s earliest ideas. \u201cI\u2019ll probably look back on it and go: \u2018Oh my God, what was I doing?\u2019\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut back then, I took it everywhere I went. It was like a sacred piece of equipment.\u201d These days, she writes song ideas into her phone.</p> <p>By 2014, a college friend had introduced Ella to a producer, who in turn knew a third aspiring singer. The producer suggested a girl band. \u201cThree or four girls sounds like a headache,\u201d Ella remembers thinking. \u201cI was like: \u2018Hell, no. I\u2019m not going to be in a girl group.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Cut to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/15/x-factor-ben-haenow-fleur-east-final\">X Factor 2014</a> and London three-piece Arize performing a Little Mix empowerment ballad. There were four yeses at the first audition, but bootcamp was less kind, and that was that. It says more about The X Factor than it does about Ella that the show\u2019s only success story of the last few years involves someone who didn\u2019t even make it to the live shows.</p> <p>I ask Ella what she thinks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/03/simon-cowell-says-giving-up-mobile-phone-has-made-him-happier\">Simon Cowell</a> meant when he told Arize: \u201cI think you\u2019re real.\u201d \u201cI have no clue <em>what </em>he meant,\u201d she laughs. \u201cProbably that he was trying to make it seem like he really cared.\u201d</p> <p>Ella is still in touch with one of her Arize bandmates; reading-between-the-lines fans may be interested to note that Ella says her main learning from Arize was that \u201cI have more patience than I thought I did\u201d.</p> <p>Amid working stints in Topshop\u2019s flagship Oxford Street store (\u201cIt was like a zoo\u201d), then at the Aveda concession in House of Fraser (\u201cA different sort of customer \u2013 not as polite\u201d), Ella met with labels where everything they suggested ended up being too pop-based. \u201cStuff that wasn\u2019t me,\u201d is how she describes it. Anyway, Ella says, she had always dreamed of signing with a US label. \u201cMy mum never understood why I said that, but the biggest example I use is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/11/grammys-urban\">Estelle</a>. I loved her even when I was little, and I always wondered why she went to America. Then I did my research, and I started to see a pattern for R&amp;B artists in the UK: there\u2019s a ceiling. You reach a certain point and you either go pop, or you disappear.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c3790554d3a4b3d9fbac76db2e80b2610a705c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c3790554d3a4b3d9fbac76db2e80b2610a705c2/219_0_2672_1603/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ella Mai with her producer DJ Mustard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keen as: Ella Mai with her producer DJ Mustard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cassidy Sparrow/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eventually the right kind of interest came via an Instagram message from Mustard, who was setting up his own label. Ella has no idea whether she was the only singer Mustard approached, but between 2015 and 2016 she would fly to and from LA. There were no contracts. \u201cI could have been totally screwed over,\u201d she accepts. \u201cI could have just been recording demos for him to give to someone else. He would just sit and watch.\u201d</p> <p>There are lessons to be learned from Ella\u2019s success: artist development is important, patience is paramount, just one song can totally change an artist\u2019s career. Also, sometimes, the best way for a song to succeed is for it to stand out. \u201cBoo\u2019d Up is a very innocent love song and we were missing that for a long time, especially in the R&amp;B world,\u201d is Ella\u2019s reasoning. \u201cIt\u2019s clean cut. No swearing. The people kind of chose it; you have to give the people what they want.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked about her passions outside music, Ella\u2019s answer is \u201cjust women empowerment\u201d, which leads her to mention her support for the #MeToo movement, then the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/09/abuse-investigations-r-kelly-documentary\">R Kelly documentary</a>, and how an initial wave of people trying to boycott the series has been supplanted by \u201cnow seeing people watch the docuseries and come out and be like: \u2018You know what, we shouldn\u2019t have had to wait this many years for these women to come out and be heard.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>This makes me wonder whether she had any qualms about working with Chris Brown, on the otherwise-quite-brilliant album track Whatchamacallit. Ella talks about separating art from artist, and how she doesn\u2019t agree with everything Brown has done. (This interview is taking place before the round of Chris Brown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/22/chris-brown-us-singer-arrested-paris-suspicion-of-rape\">headlines that popped up in late January</a>.) She adds: \u201cIn situations where things have happened and people have paid their dues, it\u2019s a little bit different, if you\u2019re comparing it to the R Kelly situation.\u201d</p> <p>We go on to talk about Ella\u2019s tattoos (one is of a lion \u2013 sadly, not the chocolate bar); her French bulldog Thierry (she supports Arsenal; the dog\u2019s currently undergoing obedience training due to being \u201cbad as hell\u201d); and her favourite book, Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s The Outliers, which inspired Ella\u2019s track 10,000 Hours. We agree that her label boss, real name Dijon McFarlane, gets too little credit for calling himself Mustard.</p> <p>In Ella\u2019s immediate future are the Brits (she is nominated for the British breakthrough award) and the Grammys, where Boo\u2019d Up is nominated for song of the year and R&amp;B song of the year. \u201cI don\u2019t know the last time an R&amp;B artist was recognised at the Brits,\u201d Ella says warily, \u201cbut we\u2019ll see. Hopefully the success of Boo\u2019d Up has shown the British industry that R&amp;B is still alive and that there\u2019s loads of room for it, but these things take time.\u201d She is more optimistic about success at the Grammys, or at least she\u2019s saying she is. \u201cI think I\u2019ll win both,\u201d she decides. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to speak it into existence, right?\u201d</p> <p>As our time runs out I say it will be interesting to see how Ella\u2019s influence will spread through music in the coming year. \u201cEven you saying that is the weirdest thing to hear,\u201d she gasps. \u201cIt\u2019s like, my <em>influence</em>! It\u2019s crazy.\u201d It\u2019s exciting for R&amp;B music, she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s important and it was needed, and I\u2019m glad I was part of it.\u201d As for whether approval from the Rihannas and the Stevies leaves Ella now feeling as if she is part of the pop establishment she once only knew as an outsider, she pauses for a moment.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird.

      "bodyText": "Ella Mai knows how to be a pop star, to such an extent that the south London-raised singer\u2019s omnipresent R&amp;B slinker Boo\u2019d Up made her the first British artist since 1992 to top the US R&amp;B chart, and has earned her two Grammy nominations this year. However, she also knows what it is like to be a fan. On tour, her merch stand offers lyric booklets, designed so that streaming-era audiences can relive the endless hours she spent as a teenager devouring the inlays that came with her favourite CDs. After the first night of Ella\u2019s UK tour, she met some of those fans: mostly girls, mostly quite young. One of their mums pulled Ella to one side and said: \u201cThanks for making the time, she\u2019s had a difficult year.\u201d Ella is still thinking of all this the next morning as she sits cross-legged on her hotel bed in her off-duty attire: blue beanie, orange hoodie, big smile. \u201cIt gives me a lot of satisfaction to know girls can look up to me the way I looked up to Lauryn Hill or Alicia Keys,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling to know I can have that impact on someone.\u201d The thing is, I begin \u2013 and even I\u2019m surprised at how early in our interview Captain Buzzkill is making an appearance \u2013 realistically, not all these kids will ever achieve their dreams. They won\u2019t have multiple award nominations, or top a billion streams, or have gold-selling albums, or tour with Bruno Mars. They might continue to have difficult years. \u201cWell,\u201d Ella nods, \u201cthat\u2019s the tough thing. That\u2019s something I\u2019m still figuring out, to be honest.\u201d If there is one theme that defines Ella Mai\u2019s success, it\u2019s figuring things out as she goes along. In an era defined by the siren\u2019s call of streaming service algorithms, many artists are finding true creativity to be hard work and reward-free; couple that with the fact that the music industry is largely built on happy accidents subsequently passed off as deliberate masterplans, and it is even more refreshing that Ella Mai makes no effort to cast the success of Boo\u2019d Up as remotely premeditated. The reality is that the song, with its very non-2010s nod to early-2000s R&amp;B, had been knocking around in a pile of demos for years. It might, Ella supposes, have been passed over by other artists first; her producer and label boss DJ Mustard shares an A&amp;R with Rihanna. In any case, Mustard only dusted off the song when he and Ella were putting the finishing touches to the three EP releases. \u201cMustard just randomly came across it,\u201d Ella remembers. \u201cHe said: \u2018Do you like this?\u2019 I said: \u2018Yeah.\u2019\u201d There was no magic or drama to the song\u2019s recording, which took place late at night, because that\u2019s when Ella works best, in a studio with just a recording engineer in attendance. \u201cI know you want to hear an exciting story,\u201d Ella laughs. \u201cIt was just another session. I recorded it, and the EP was done. Such a boring story.\u201d The truth, I offer, is never boring. Neither of us seems particularly convinced. In any case, Ella\u2019s third EP came out, and it went down well with her slowly growing fanbase, built through support slots with acts such as Kehlani, but none of the EP\u2019s tracks exactly prompted spontaneous international street parties. \u201cWe were still very hopeful,\u201d Ella says today. \u201c[Mustard] never said to me: \u2018I don\u2019t know if what we\u2019re doing is right.\u2019 He\u2019s stuck by his first gut feeling about me. Luckily, it got us somewhere.\u201d It did indeed. Ten months later, a clubber requested Boo\u2019d Up from Bay Area DJ Big Von, who spoke to Rolling Stone and summarised the crowd response thusly: \u201cI saw a fat dude do a cartwheel \u2013 a solid cartwheel, he didn\u2019t even fall. Security comes over to me: \u2018What the hell is this?\u2019\u201d The song spread. Nicki Minaj and Quavo hopped on a remix. Rihanna, far from taking umbrage at Ella, listened along to it on Instagram. By mid-2018, after more than a year, Ella\u2019s slow-burn hit had become inescapable. At one photoshoot last year, Ella was handed a phone, and on the other end of the line was someone who\u2019d just called to say he loved Boo\u2019d: \u201cHe started talking, and I thought, \u2018Hold on \u2026 \u2019 I don\u2019t know who I expected it to be, but I definitely didn\u2019t expect it to be Stevie Wonder.\u201d Last Christmas, Wonder introduced Ella on stage at a charity event where they performed Superstition together, saying: \u201cShe made me want to go home and do some things. And guess what? I did.\u201d Write a song? Defrost the freezer? Hard to say. Either way: \u201cProbably the greatest thing I\u2019ve ever heard in my life,\u201d Ella beams today. All of which would have seemed at best unlikely to the Ella Mai kicking around south-west London hotspots such as Mitcham, Merton and Wimbledon Chase in the early 2000s. Let\u2019s just say, tourists on future Ella Mai sightseeing tours won\u2019t be in for the most exciting afternoon of their lives. (Ella\u2019s summary: \u201cIt\u2019s very residential and then there\u2019s \u2026 nothing.\u201d) She would play football on Saturdays, and on Sundays she\u2019d be in church with her grandmother, a minister in a pentecostal church. Ella\u2019s parents had split when the kids were young; Ella says that when it came to raising Ella and older brother Miles, \u201cmum did all the work\u201d. The names Ella and Miles give a glimpse at the intensity of their mother\u2019s passion for the jazz greats, and Ella\u2019s own tastes broadened with the arrival of her first iPod. When Ella was in year nine, her mum got a job in the States, which took Ella to New York. She hated it there. \u201cAt 13, you\u2019re trying to find yourself anyway,\u201d Ella says today, \u201cbut I felt so different, and I was the only one with an English accent.\u201d Then, there it is again: \u201cI learned to not think about it too much, and try and figure it out as I went along.\u201d Eventually, the family moved back to the UK and Ella scored a place at music college. Somewhere in her mum\u2019s house is an old softback (\u201cbut not flimsy\u201d) Paperchase notebook containing Ella\u2019s earliest ideas. \u201cI\u2019ll probably look back on it and go: \u2018Oh my God, what was I doing?\u2019\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut back then, I took it everywhere I went. It was like a sacred piece of equipment.\u201d These days, she writes song ideas into her phone. By 2014, a college friend had introduced Ella to a producer, who in turn knew a third aspiring singer. The producer suggested a girl band. \u201cThree or four girls sounds like a headache,\u201d Ella remembers thinking. \u201cI was like: \u2018Hell, no. I\u2019m not going to be in a girl group.\u2019\u201d Cut to X Factor 2014 and London three-piece Arize performing a Little Mix empowerment ballad. There were four yeses at the first audition, but bootcamp was less kind, and that was that. It says more about The X Factor than it does about Ella that the show\u2019s only success story of the last few years involves someone who didn\u2019t even make it to the live shows. I ask Ella what she thinks Simon Cowell meant when he told Arize: \u201cI think you\u2019re real.\u201d \u201cI have no clue what he meant,\u201d she laughs. \u201cProbably that he was trying to make it seem like he really cared.\u201d Ella is still in touch with one of her Arize bandmates; reading-between-the-lines fans may be interested to note that Ella says her main learning from Arize was that \u201cI have more patience than I thought I did\u201d. Amid working stints in Topshop\u2019s flagship Oxford Street store (\u201cIt was like a zoo\u201d), then at the Aveda concession in House of Fraser (\u201cA different sort of customer \u2013 not as polite\u201d), Ella met with labels where everything they suggested ended up being too pop-based. \u201cStuff that wasn\u2019t me,\u201d is how she describes it. Anyway, Ella says, she had always dreamed of signing with a US label. \u201cMy mum never understood why I said that, but the biggest example I use is Estelle. I loved her even when I was little, and I always wondered why she went to America. Then I did my research, and I started to see a pattern for R&amp;B artists in the UK: there\u2019s a ceiling. You reach a certain point and you either go pop, or you disappear.\u201d Eventually the right kind of interest came via an Instagram message from Mustard, who was setting up his own label. Ella has no idea whether she was the only singer Mustard approached, but between 2015 and 2016 she would fly to and from LA. There were no contracts. \u201cI could have been totally screwed over,\u201d she accepts. \u201cI could have just been recording demos for him to give to someone else. He would just sit and watch.\u201d There are lessons to be learned from Ella\u2019s success: artist development is important, patience is paramount, just one song can totally change an artist\u2019s career. Also, sometimes, the best way for a song to succeed is for it to stand out. \u201cBoo\u2019d Up is a very innocent love song and we were missing that for a long time, especially in the R&amp;B world,\u201d is Ella\u2019s reasoning. \u201cIt\u2019s clean cut. No swearing. The people kind of chose it; you have to give the people what they want.\u201d Asked about her passions outside music, Ella\u2019s answer is \u201cjust women empowerment\u201d, which leads her to mention her support for the #MeToo movement, then the recent R Kelly documentary, and how an initial wave of people trying to boycott the series has been supplanted by \u201cnow seeing people watch the docuseries and come out and be like: \u2018You know what, we shouldn\u2019t have had to wait this many years for these women to come out and be heard.\u2019\u201d This makes me wonder whether she had any qualms about working with Chris Brown, on the otherwise-quite-brilliant album track Whatchamacallit. Ella talks about separating art from artist, and how she doesn\u2019t agree with everything Brown has done. (This interview is taking place before the round of Chris Brown headlines that popped up in late January.) She adds: \u201cIn situations where things have happened and people have paid their dues, it\u2019s a little bit different, if you\u2019re comparing it to the R Kelly situation.\u201d We go on to talk about Ella\u2019s tattoos (one is of a lion \u2013 sadly, not the chocolate bar); her French bulldog Thierry (she supports Arsenal; the dog\u2019s currently undergoing obedience training due to being \u201cbad as hell\u201d); and her favourite book, Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s The Outliers, which inspired Ella\u2019s track 10,000 Hours. We agree that her label boss, real name Dijon McFarlane, gets too little credit for calling himself Mustard. In Ella\u2019s immediate future are the Brits (she is nominated for the British breakthrough award) and the Grammys, where Boo\u2019d Up is nominated for song of the year and R&amp;B song of the year. \u201cI don\u2019t know the last time an R&amp;B artist was recognised at the Brits,\u201d Ella says warily, \u201cbut we\u2019ll see. Hopefully the success of Boo\u2019d Up has shown the British industry that R&amp;B is still alive and that there\u2019s loads of room for it, but these things take time.\u201d She is more optimistic about success at the Grammys, or at least she\u2019s saying she is. \u201cI think I\u2019ll win both,\u201d she decides. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to speak it into existence, right?\u201d As our time runs out I say it will be interesting to see how Ella\u2019s influence will spread through music in the coming year. \u201cEven you saying that is the weirdest thing to hear,\u201d she gasps. \u201cIt\u2019s like, my influence! It\u2019s crazy.\u201d It\u2019s exciting for R&amp;B music, she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s important and it was needed, and I\u2019m glad I was part of it.\u201d As for whether approval from the Rihannas and the Stevies leaves Ella now feeling as if she is part of the pop establishment she once only knew as an outsider, she pauses for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. It\u2019s surreal to think that these are now my peers. Technically, to everyone on the outside, I\u2019m one of them. To me, I\u2019m just Ella.\u201d Ella Mai\u2019s self-titled album is out now on 10 Summers/Interscope",

All of us need darkness in the evening to help encourage the release of a hormone called melatonin. Melatonin times the healthy onset of your sleep cycle. Yet we are bathed in artificial light in the evenings from computer screens, smartphones and overhead lighting. That artificial evening light blocks the normal release of melatonin. As a result, your brain doesn\u2019t know it is night-time. Make sure your bedroom is dark and that you are not looking at bright light sources in the evening. Try to dim down the lights in your home in the last hour before bed, and avoid looking at computer screens and mobile phones during this time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ce748fd431539fa408ba33157305207d0ff0e362\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce748fd431539fa408ba33157305207d0ff0e362/0_0_339_339/339.png\" alt=\"Clock\" width=\"339\" height=\"339\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>2) Regularity</h2> <p>Try to go to bed and wake up at about the same time every day, regardless of whether it is a weekday or the weekend, or how well you slept the night before. This signals to your body a regular time for sleeping and being awake. Many of us set alarms to wake up, but you can also help yourself by setting an alarm for bedtime. Some people find that it helps to get changed for bed and to brush their teeth at least an hour before sleep. For those people who do struggle with falling or staying asleep, regular daytime naps should be avoided. Naps can release the healthy sleepiness that builds up during a day. As a result, you may not feel as sleepy at night, worsening night-time sleep difficulties.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1e4fc17be45093b770dc620012e7d140aea6f1db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e4fc17be45093b770dc620012e7d140aea6f1db/0_0_339_339/339.png\" alt=\"Temperature\" width=\"339\" height=\"339\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>3) Temperature</h2> <p>Our body\u2019s core temperature needs to drop in order for us to fall asleep and stay asleep. This is why you will always find it easier to fall asleep in a room that\u2019s too cold than too hot. Keep temperatures in your bedroom cool at night. A little above 17\u00b0C is optimal for most people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7c7770c99bdeb8688771de222b1d7211ded43270\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c7770c99bdeb8688771de222b1d7211ded43270/0_0_339_339/339.png\" alt=\"Eye\" width=\"339\" height=\"339\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>4) Get up</h2> <p>Don\u2019t stay in bed awake too long \u2013 no more than 25 minutes. Otherwise, your brain gradually learns that the bed is about being awake. Instead, get up and read a book under dim light in a different room (or different part of the room). Only go back to bed when you are sleepy. This way, your brain re-learns the association between bed and sound sleep.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2f3ef142a889fd5d55d5a0b6485ac0eb5637318f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f3ef142a889fd5d55d5a0b6485ac0eb5637318f/0_0_339_339/339.png\" alt=\"Tea\" width=\"339\" height=\"339\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>5) Side-step the caffeine and evening nightcap</h2> <p>This tip makes me (even more) unpopular, but the science warrants the risk. Avoid caffeine after noon and stay away from the alcohol-infused nightcap. Both of these interfere with sleep.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/feb/09/foodanddrink.features8\">Caffeine</a>, from coffee, many teas as well as energy drinks and dark chocolate, is a psychoactive stimulant drug (the only one we readily give to our children). Caffeine can make it harder to fall asleep, prevents you from reaching the deepest sleep, and can cause early morning awakenings. Alcohol, in contrast, is a sedative.</p> <p>However, sedation is not sleep, yet many people mistake the former for the latter. Alcohol does not induce naturalistic deep sleep. An evening drink will also make you wake up many times in the night, and leave you feeling unrestored by sleep the next day. Finally, alcohol is a potent blocker of dream sleep, also known as REM sleep, which is critical for many brain and body functions.</p>",

Melatonin times the healthy onset of your sleep cycle. Yet we are bathed in artificial light in the evenings from computer screens, smartphones and overhead lighting. That artificial evening light blocks the normal release of melatonin. As a result, your brain doesn\u2019t know it is night-time. Make sure your bedroom is dark and that you are not looking at bright light sources in the evening. Try to dim down the lights in your home in the last hour before bed, and avoid looking at computer screens and mobile phones during this time. 2) Regularity Try to go to bed and wake up at about the same time every day, regardless of whether it is a weekday or the weekend, or how well you slept the night before. This signals to your body a regular time for sleeping and being awake. Many of us set alarms to wake up, but you can also help yourself by setting an alarm for bedtime. Some people find that it helps to get changed for bed and to brush their teeth at least an hour before sleep. For those people who do struggle with falling or staying asleep, regular daytime naps should be avoided. Naps can release the healthy sleepiness that builds up during a day. As a result, you may not feel as sleepy at night, worsening night-time sleep difficulties. 3) Temperature Our body\u2019s core temperature needs to drop in order for us to fall asleep and stay asleep. This is why you will always find it easier to fall asleep in a room that\u2019s too cold than too hot. Keep temperatures in your bedroom cool at night. A little above 17\u00b0C is optimal for most people. 4) Get up Don\u2019t stay in bed awake too long \u2013 no more than 25 minutes. Otherwise, your brain gradually learns that the bed is about being awake. Instead, get up and read a book under dim light in a different room (or different part of the room). Only go back to bed when you are sleepy. This way, your brain re-learns the association between bed and sound sleep. 5) Side-step the caffeine and evening nightcap This tip makes me (even more) unpopular, but the science warrants the risk. Avoid caffeine after noon and stay away from the alcohol-infused nightcap. Both of these interfere with sleep. Caffeine, from coffee, many teas as well as energy drinks and dark chocolate, is a psychoactive stimulant drug (the only one we readily give to our children). Caffeine can make it harder to fall asleep, prevents you from reaching the deepest sleep, and can cause early morning awakenings. Alcohol, in contrast, is a sedative. However, sedation is not sleep, yet many people mistake the former for the latter. Alcohol does not induce naturalistic deep sleep. An evening drink will also make you wake up many times in the night, and leave you feeling unrestored by sleep the next day. Finally, alcohol is a potent blocker of dream sleep, also known as REM sleep, which is critical for many brain and body functions.",

      "bodyText": "David Bowie: Finding Fame 9pm, BBC Two \u201cHe wasn\u2019t lost; he just wasn\u2019t found,\u201d comments Bowie\u2019s former muse Hermione Farthingale on his pre-fame years. This feature-length documentary about his formative influences traces the steps of how this clever young \u201cjack the lad\u201d with a Tony Newley fixation finally broke big. Superb, and often very funny. Ali Catterall Safe Harbour 9pm, BBC Four We all rolled our eyes when the ghost of Jim Robinson appeared in a Christmas bauble on Neighbours recently, but this beautifully shot yet morally murky four-parter ably demonstrates the real quality and ambition of current Aussie TV drama. The climactic double bill burrows even deeper into exactly what happened five years ago on an ill-fated yachting trip that entwined the lives of middle-class Brisbanites and a group of desperate refugees; submerged secrets bubble up into anger and violence in the present day. Graeme Virtue The Voice UK 8pm, ITV Comfortably eclipsing primetime rival The Greatest Dancer in the ratings, it seems a very long time ago that The Voice was regarded as something of a flop among the many TV talent contests. Here, it enters the penultimate set of blind auditions, with some more unseen hopefuls seeking to get in under the wire before the Battle stage begins in two weeks\u2019 time. Gwilym Mumford Drain the Ocean: Egypt\u2019s Lost Wonders 9pm, Channel 5 The title might sound like the name of prog-metal band, but that distraction aside Drain the Ocean proves itself to be a lively slice of pop archaeology. Having explored second world war wrecks and doomed steamships, this week the series looks at the Nile and the \u201cmega-forts\u201d lying at its bottom. GM The Radical Story of Patty Hearst 9pm, PBS America Missing from this CNN-produced docuseries on the kidnapping and radicalisation of the media heiresss is the account of Hearst herself, who has been critical of its making. In her absence, witnesses to the abduction \u2013 and even a member of the SLA \u2013 this week recall her decision to defect to their cause. GM Mayans MC 10.30pm, BBC Two In a double bill of this watchable but hardly indispensable Sons of Anarchy spin-off, Adelita warns Angel her group is running out of places to hide, a drug deal struck with the Chinese turns bloody and a desperate Emily goes in search of her baby. Meanwhile, a house party attended by the Mayans is gatecrashed. David Stubbs Film choice Stand By Me, 9pm, True Movies Working from Stephen King\u2019s rite-of-passage story, Rob Reiner created a classic Huck Finn-ish adventure in a 50s US backwater. Four pals are trekking through the woods one summer in search of a corpse; they are captured perfectly on the point of adolescence, between innocence and experience. Paul Howlett Today\u2019s best live sport Premier League Football: Fulham v Manchester United, 11.30am, Sky Sports Main Event Brighton v Burnley airs at 5pm on BT Sport 1. Test Cricket: West Indies v England, 1.30pm, Sky Sports Cricket England seek a consolation win. Six Nations Rugby Union: Scotland v Ireland, 2pm, BBC One Italy v Wales airs at 4pm on ITV.",

But this is no cosy bedtime vignette with a yawning, pyjama-clad toddler perched on a parent\u2019s knee: Phoebe is 17 years old and she is drinking coffee and eating breakfast as she listens, before heading out to school. Like her siblings \u2013 Molly, 24, Paris, 22, Violet, 18, and Flora, 13 \u2013 she has grown up being read to, and it\u2019s something that hasn\u2019t stopped just because she\u2019s hit adolescence.</p> <p>Cox Gurdon is a reading-aloud tub-thumper.

The fact it has dwindled into something for children does not mean it needs to stay there.\u201d</p> <p>Cox Gurdon senses the tide is turning, that we are ready to hear our stories out loud again \u2013 witness the huge success of audiobooks and podcasts \u2013 and hopes that the power of reading to teenagers and older people will now be more widely acknowledged.</p> <p>Certainly the teen years can be a turbulent time, when a port in a storm \u2013 a familiar book, read by a familiar voice, perhaps \u2013 might be very welcome. \u201cThere is so much flux and transition during those years,\u201d she says. \u201cAs a teenager it is difficult to find those portals back to childhood that you sometimes want, and there is a wonderful return that older children can have just by being exposed to the books of their younger childhood.\u201d</p> <p>Cox Gurdon\u2019s three oldest children live away from home, but they still opt into evening reading sessions when they are back. A book sometimes comes out at the dinner table, or the older ones pop in on the younger ones while they are being read to.

      "body": "<p>People make the journey to Maidenhead for different reasons. Fiction offers contrasting examples. George Harvey Bone, the tortured soul at the heart of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/06/patrick-hamilton-hangover-square-world-slide-abyss-rereading\" title=\"\">Patrick Hamilton\u2019s novel Hangover Square</a>, reached the town just after war broke out in 1939, after walking all the way from Earl\u2019s Court and the bodies of the couple he\u2019d killed the previous morning. To him, the word Maidenhead meant past innocence and future salvation. He imagined he would find \u201cpeace, the river, an inn, a quiet glass of beer, and safety, utter safety \u2026\u201d Ascoyne d\u2019Ascoyne in the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/22/favourite-film-kind-hearts-coronets\" title=\"\">Kind Hearts and Coronets</a>, on the other hand, went there for something livelier: to spend a weekend with his mistress at a Thames-side hotel, which was the fashion among the louche and wealthy in the Edwardian days when Maidenhead\u2019s reputation came second only to Brighton\u2019s as the raciest town in England.</p> <p>Both men promptly died there \u2013 Bone by sticking his head over a gas ring, D\u2019Ascoyne when his punt tipped over a weir (no accident). The visitor to Maidenhead can walk down to the riverside and see the spot where the episode in that most perfect of Ealing comedies was shot. In life, it was the old Guards Club, where the officers from the brigade\u2019s barracks at Pirbright and Windsor would come to dance, swim and row, and befriend the chorus girls who lived across the river in the so-called Gaiety houses that took their name from the London music hall. In the film, the club grounds become a hotel garden where Alec Guinness as the arrogant D\u2019Ascoyne is solicitously pouring champagne for his lover \u2013 unaware that life, like a weekend, is short.</p> <p>I sat on a bench there on Wednesday and looked at the rowers slicing through the current. This was the pleasant side of Maidenhead: black-and-white, neo-Jacobean villas with cupolas and turrets; boathouses; willows. Upstream lay Cookham and Marlow and downstream Bray and Windsor \u2013 placenames associated with monarchs, Michelin-starred restaurants and popular entertainers who are variously dead or alive or released on licence: Diana Dors, Ernie Wise, Michael Parkinson, Rolf Harris.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"460d932556296b6eb103042a8aa86e7377e70042\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/460d932556296b6eb103042a8aa86e7377e70042/0_320_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa and Philip May walk near church in Maidenhead\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018May won Maidenhead for the first time in 1997 and since than has increased her share of the vote from roughly half to roughly two-thirds.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The comic novelist John O\u2019Farrell, who grew up in Maidenhead (and in 2001 stood as the constituency\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/may/12/election2001.politicalcolumnists\" title=\"\">Labour candidate</a>), once characterised this stretch of the Thames Valley as \u201cTory since the Bronze Age\u201d, a corner of Middle England with inhabitants who \u201csomehow give the impression of having been nouveau riche for 10 successive generations\u201d. That may be accurate so far as it goes, but it misses Maidenhead\u2019s position at the centre of English life. From a riverside bench in Maidenhead you can see plane after plane climb into the air from Heathrow, and new Japanese trains whiz to and from Paddington over Brunel\u2019s bridge \u2013 the same bridge that Turner painted in Rain, Steam and Speed. And since 2016, to complete this overcrowded picture of England in miniature, past and present, Maidenhead\u2019s MP has also been the UK\u2019s prime minister.</p> <p>The town, as opposed to its almost-suburb on the riverbank, is rather ugly. It grew up around the railway station in the 19th century and has been badly knocked about by property developers over the past 60 years, so that its centre holds chastening examples of every architectural fashion since the 1950s. A few remnants of an earlier time persist. A <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-19928342\" title=\"\">plaque</a> at the little stadium of Maidenhead United FC, for example, records that it first saw a football match on 16 February 1871, making it the world\u2019s \u201coldest senior football ground continuously used by the same club\u201d. An isolated terrace of tall houses in brown Victorian brick awaits demolition nearby, its corner pub closed and every window boarded. These were homes for a working class in the small towns of southern England that popular history tends to forget.</p> <p>Theresa May\u2019s parents came from this class. According to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/19/theresa-may-biography-rosa-prince-andrew-rawnsley-observer-review\" title=\"\"> Rosa Prince\u2019s biography of May</a>, both of her grandmothers were domestic servants; a great-grandfather was a butler; other ancestors included carpenters, dressmakers and soldiers of no rank higher than sergeant major. By the early years of the last century, most of them had left rural cottages in Surrey and Devon for workaday homes near London. Her mother grew up in a terrace house in Reading with an outside lavatory at the back and a view of tram tracks from the front. It was her father\u2019s occupation as vicar that gave the family a different view of themselves or who they might become.</p> <p>May won Maidenhead for the first time in 1997 and since then has increased her share of the vote from roughly half to roughly two-thirds. She seems well liked. People speak admiringly of the time she gives to her constituency \u201cwhen she has all this other stuff to worry about\u201d. They like her sense of duty, but then she likes that about herself too: \u201cI grew up the daughter of a local vicar and the granddaughter of a regimental sergeant major. Public service has been part of who I am for as long as I can remember.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c472359ad2eb3e2f06ebc25d9dd96adb07f45cf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c472359ad2eb3e2f06ebc25d9dd96adb07f45cf1/0_0_6466_4801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turner's Rain, Steam and Speed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"742\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018From a riverside bench in Maidenhead you can see plane after plane climb into the air from Heathrow and new Japanese trains whiz to and from Paddington over Brunel\u2019s bridge \u2013 the same bridge that Turner painted in Rain, Steam and Speed.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imagno/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The chair of the town\u2019s Conservative Association, Councillor Richard Kellaway, voted remain partly for the interesting reason that in his work as an oil industry consultant he had always found Brussels easier to deal with than Whitehall. When I asked him if Brexit had caused divisions in the local party, he said that \u201cby and large\u201d it stood right behind her: there had been \u201cno ferment\u201d. He was a friendly, steady kind of man; as was Pat McDonald, parish councillor and Labour candidate at the last general election.</p> <p>Maidenhead has problems. McDonald in particular stressed the damage that has been caused by the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead sacking two-thirds of its staff. But mainly they are problems caused by prosperity: the difficulty of finding room to build new houses when 83% of local land is defined as green belt and another 7%as floodplain; the worry that the new trains for Crossrail won\u2019t have lavatories, although Maidenhead to Tottenham Court Road might take an hour; the fear that trains to London every 10 minutes will finally abolish any claim Maidenhead has to a separate identity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/07/labour-mps-theresa-may-brexit-promises\">Labour MPs must not be fooled by Theresa May\u2019s Brexit promises | Faiza Shaheen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fact is that nothing very bad has happened in Maidenhead, outside the exercise of personal appetites.

      "bodyText": "People make the journey to Maidenhead for different reasons. Fiction offers contrasting examples. George Harvey Bone, the tortured soul at the heart of Patrick Hamilton\u2019s novel Hangover Square, reached the town just after war broke out in 1939, after walking all the way from Earl\u2019s Court and the bodies of the couple he\u2019d killed the previous morning. To him, the word Maidenhead meant past innocence and future salvation. He imagined he would find \u201cpeace, the river, an inn, a quiet glass of beer, and safety, utter safety \u2026\u201d Ascoyne d\u2019Ascoyne in the film Kind Hearts and Coronets, on the other hand, went there for something livelier: to spend a weekend with his mistress at a Thames-side hotel, which was the fashion among the louche and wealthy in the Edwardian days when Maidenhead\u2019s reputation came second only to Brighton\u2019s as the raciest town in England. Both men promptly died there \u2013 Bone by sticking his head over a gas ring, D\u2019Ascoyne when his punt tipped over a weir (no accident). The visitor to Maidenhead can walk down to the riverside and see the spot where the episode in that most perfect of Ealing comedies was shot. In life, it was the old Guards Club, where the officers from the brigade\u2019s barracks at Pirbright and Windsor would come to dance, swim and row, and befriend the chorus girls who lived across the river in the so-called Gaiety houses that took their name from the London music hall. In the film, the club grounds become a hotel garden where Alec Guinness as the arrogant D\u2019Ascoyne is solicitously pouring champagne for his lover \u2013 unaware that life, like a weekend, is short. I sat on a bench there on Wednesday and looked at the rowers slicing through the current. This was the pleasant side of Maidenhead: black-and-white, neo-Jacobean villas with cupolas and turrets; boathouses; willows. Upstream lay Cookham and Marlow and downstream Bray and Windsor \u2013 placenames associated with monarchs, Michelin-starred restaurants and popular entertainers who are variously dead or alive or released on licence: Diana Dors, Ernie Wise, Michael Parkinson, Rolf Harris. The comic novelist John O\u2019Farrell, who grew up in Maidenhead (and in 2001 stood as the constituency\u2019s Labour candidate), once characterised this stretch of the Thames Valley as \u201cTory since the Bronze Age\u201d, a corner of Middle England with inhabitants who \u201csomehow give the impression of having been nouveau riche for 10 successive generations\u201d. That may be accurate so far as it goes, but it misses Maidenhead\u2019s position at the centre of English life. From a riverside bench in Maidenhead you can see plane after plane climb into the air from Heathrow, and new Japanese trains whiz to and from Paddington over Brunel\u2019s bridge \u2013 the same bridge that Turner painted in Rain, Steam and Speed. And since 2016, to complete this overcrowded picture of England in miniature, past and present, Maidenhead\u2019s MP has also been the UK\u2019s prime minister. The town, as opposed to its almost-suburb on the riverbank, is rather ugly. It grew up around the railway station in the 19th century and has been badly knocked about by property developers over the past 60 years, so that its centre holds chastening examples of every architectural fashion since the 1950s. A few remnants of an earlier time persist. A plaque at the little stadium of Maidenhead United FC, for example, records that it first saw a football match on 16 February 1871, making it the world\u2019s \u201coldest senior football ground continuously used by the same club\u201d. An isolated terrace of tall houses in brown Victorian brick awaits demolition nearby, its corner pub closed and every window boarded. These were homes for a working class in the small towns of southern England that popular history tends to forget. Theresa May\u2019s parents came from this class. According to Rosa Prince\u2019s biography of May, both of her grandmothers were domestic servants; a great-grandfather was a butler; other ancestors included carpenters, dressmakers and soldiers of no rank higher than sergeant major. By the early years of the last century, most of them had left rural cottages in Surrey and Devon for workaday homes near London. Her mother grew up in a terrace house in Reading with an outside lavatory at the back and a view of tram tracks from the front. It was her father\u2019s occupation as vicar that gave the family a different view of themselves or who they might become. May won Maidenhead for the first time in 1997 and since then has increased her share of the vote from roughly half to roughly two-thirds. She seems well liked. People speak admiringly of the time she gives to her constituency \u201cwhen she has all this other stuff to worry about\u201d. They like her sense of duty, but then she likes that about herself too: \u201cI grew up the daughter of a local vicar and the granddaughter of a regimental sergeant major. Public service has been part of who I am for as long as I can remember.\u201d The chair of the town\u2019s Conservative Association, Councillor Richard Kellaway, voted remain partly for the interesting reason that in his work as an oil industry consultant he had always found Brussels easier to deal with than Whitehall. When I asked him if Brexit had caused divisions in the local party, he said that \u201cby and large\u201d it stood right behind her: there had been \u201cno ferment\u201d. He was a friendly, steady kind of man; as was Pat McDonald, parish councillor and Labour candidate at the last general election. Maidenhead has problems. McDonald in particular stressed the damage that has been caused by the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead sacking two-thirds of its staff. But mainly they are problems caused by prosperity: the difficulty of finding room to build new houses when 83% of local land is defined as green belt and another 7%as floodplain; the worry that the new trains for Crossrail won\u2019t have lavatories, although Maidenhead to Tottenham Court Road might take an hour; the fear that trains to London every 10 minutes will finally abolish any claim Maidenhead has to a separate identity. The fact is that nothing very bad has happened in Maidenhead, outside the exercise of personal appetites. The place to satisfy them used to be Skindles, a riverside hotel that began life as a coaching inn and later became notorious as a leading home counties venue for adultery. It was demolished in 2015 and replaced by expensive houses and a brasserie, Roux at Skindles \u2013 where for lunch, in a vague attempt to revive the Edwardian spirit, I decided to have a bowl of fish soup and a glass of the house champagne. They came. I ate. \u201cIf we don\u2019t like the chablis we\u2019ll just throw it away,\u201d said an animated, silver-haired man to a waiter at an adjacent table, sounding as if he owned the place, which he did. Reviving the Edwardian spirit even further, I had my card delivered to his table with a note. \u201cDear M Roux, I wonder if you could spare two minutes for \u2026\u201d He came over, which was good of him.

Look out in 2024 for those Roux branches opening in Sunderland and Stoke. \u2022 Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist",

This walk was one of my little terrier Phoebe\u2019s favourites, where she could chase sticks and brandish them vigorously before digging them into the sand. She breathed her last peacefully on my lap a week before Christmas, and is buried now in a small, neat grave marked out by quartz pebbles and violets in my garden. I came back here to remember her, who delighted me through so many years; and also, because from the top of Craig Ddu you can observe one of the great natural sights around the Welsh coasts. I headed in that direction, the wash of surf into the pebbled shore sounding in my ears; climbed to the summit without Phoebe\u2019s brisk example to spur me on; took out my flask, mounted an optic on its tripod, made a seat of my rucksack, and scanned the sea, anxious to set eyes on a rare, wonderful winter presence that distinguishes this corner of Porthmadog Bay. There they were, in their thousands \u2013 a huge raft of common scoter scattered a few hundred metres offshore, its size only slowly becoming apparent as separate groups undulated in and out of sight among the roll of the waves, while others fed, dipping with a small leap into the water, surfacing yards away. WH Hudson, a century ago, commented on how a scoter\u2019s \u201cblackness is relieved, and its handsomeness brought out, by a touch of bright orange on the upper mandible\u201d \u2013 something I saw clearly through my glass even at this distance. Their numbers are a winter rarity this far north. As a British breeding species, scoter are on Birdlife International\u2019s red list, a few pairs remaining in Perthshire. Which makes these winter visitors all the more heartening a sight. Already they seem restless, flying in long lines low over the water. But for a few weeks yet, before they head back to the cold north, you can see them here, marvel at their multitudes and the mystery of migration, and be glad that our beleaguered planet still has such richness.",

The European commission and the British government have already confirmed that if the UK falls out of the EU without a deal on 29 March, Britain will leave the bloc\u2019s electronic excise movement and control system (EMCS).</p> <p>\u201cThe consequences of that don\u2019t really bear thinking about,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the online system for moving alcohol round Europe. It makes the business seamless, gets trucks through Calais and Dover with a minimum of checks, means governments are confident they\u2019ll get their VAT and duty.\u201d</p> <p>Without EMCS, Quinney says, the only feasible fallback \u2013 until a new system arrives, which could take months or even years \u2013 will be pieces of paper, and pieces of paper spell long, long delays. \u201cWe know that no deal will mean logjams, complete chaos, at Calais and Dover for everyone,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cPretty soon, it would be hard to find a transporter willing or able to take the job. Plus, in warm weather you really can\u2019t have quality wine stuck for two or three days at the border unless it\u2019s in refrigerated trucks, which cost a fortune. We have no option but to shift what stock we can now.\u201d</p> <p>EMCS is what makes it feasible \u2013 and profitable \u2013 for Adrian Munns to spend several days filling an articulated lorry with wine from more than 20 different Bordeaux producers, including Ch\u00e2teau Bauduc, then drive it, twice a month, to four or five different destinations in Britain.</p> <p>\u201cWithout it, my job would be impossible,\u201d says Munns, 62. \u201cI\u2019d just give up if that went, I think. Retire. I can\u2019t imagine going back to the old forms; it\u2019d be a nightmare. They won\u2019t be able to come up with a similar system for years.\u201d</p> <p>Munns says Ch\u00e2teau Bauduc is far from alone in building up stock in Britain. For his UK trade customers, Quinney aims to have tens of thousands of bottles \u2013 at significant extra cost \u2013 stored in bonded warehousing by mid-March.</p> <p>He is also launching a promotional deal for private customers, offering them duty and tax-free collection from a Calais warehouse before Brexit day. \u201cOur bottom line is: buy your wine now,\u201d he says. \u201cFill the garage and the spare room. Because frankly, nobody has the faintest clue what happens next.\u201d</p> <p>In his offices in an old stone wine warehouse on the Quai de Bacalan in central Bordeaux, Allan Sichel, the president of the Bordeaux Wine Council, which represents both the region\u2019s 6,500 winemakers and the 300-odd wine merchants who market 75% of their output, says Quinney\u2019s alarm is widely shared.</p> <p>The industry is \u201cvery concerned indeed\u201d by Brexit, and particularly the prospect of no deal, says Sichel, who also runs the family\u2019s 135-year-old wine merchants. \u201cWhen we know what we have to do, of course we\u2019ll be able to do it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut right now we don\u2019t know what will change, and we may not have time to get ready for it.\u201d</p> <p>The UK is the fourth biggest global market for Bordeaux wines, accounting for nearly 24m bottles last year \u2013 a trade that dates back to the three centuries after 1154, when much of Aquitaine in south-west France was ruled by the kings of England and profits from the sale of <em>clairet,</em> or claret, were the crown\u2019s main source of income.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0ed77feba21571bacc8411102d56913db9e154bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ed77feba21571bacc8411102d56913db9e154bc/0_252_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Thierry Decr\u00e9: British fine wine merchants have 'bought wisely and hold plenty of good stock'.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thierry Decr\u00e9: British fine wine merchants have \u2018bought wisely and hold plenty of good stock\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Henley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is \u201creal passion for our wines in Britain, and a huge amount of expertise\u201d, says Sichel.

Average consumption is approximately 20 litres a head. Eight countries have at least a 5% share in this highly competitive market: Italy (3m hl), Australia (2.1m hl), France (1.7m hl), Spain (1.3m hl), Chile/US/South Africa (all around 1.1m hl), New Zealand (0.8m hl), Germany (0.7m hl). Bordeaux has 120,000 hectares of vineyards, and its 6,500 winemakers produce 750m bottles of wine a year. Sales of Bordeaux to the UK in the 12 months to the end of November 2018: 179,696 hl, which is nearly 24m bottles \u2013 roughly 8% of total Bordeaux volume and 10% of total value. The UK is Bordeaux\u2019s fourth-biggest global market after China, the US and (just bigger) Belgium. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 February and 5 March 2019 to correct figures for UK imports of wine from New Zealand and Germany: 0.8m hl and 0.7m hl respectively, not 800m hl and 700m hl as stated in an earlier version.",

Bezos said Thursday the tabloid threatened to release nude photos of him if he did not issue a public statement absolving the Enquirer of allegations that its actions have been politically motivated.</li> <li>White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said a woman assaulted her at a restaurant in October -- detailing an encounter in which the woman in question grabbed and shook Conway while yelling at her in front of her daughter. The woman is set to stand trial in March. Her lawyer disputes Conway\u2019s account.</li> <li>Ivanka Trump says she had minimal knowledge of discussions around a potential Trump Tower project in Moscow during the 2016 presidential election.

If you think the official mention from her office that there will be hot cocoa, cookies and \u201cwarming stations\u201d at the event in Minneapolis sounds a bit too cuddly, consider that the weather forecast is predicting a high of just 18F with a brisk north-easterly breeze and snow showers. </p> <p>Klobuchar, 59, is the sixth prominent woman to wade into the primary contest, which features a record number of women vying for a major-party nomination.</p> <p>Unlike some of her fellow senators, Klobuchar has kept a low profile in Washington. She is neither the progressive firebrand that is Warren nor has the vast social media following that transformed Cory Booker into a star.</p> <p>Klobuchar is instead known a soft-spoken policymaker who has quietly built a network of supporters, in contrast with some of the Democratic contenders who have embraced confrontation with Trump head-on.</p> <p>The Democratic party has been somewhat torn over whether candidates should try and match Trump\u2019s bullying tactics or fall back upon Michelle Obama\u2019s 2016 advice: \u201cWhen they go low, we go high.\u201d</p> <p>Klobuchar suggested she would forge a middle ground, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-2020-election.html\">stating</a>: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with, \u2018When they go low, we go low,\u2019 but I do agree that when they go low, we have to respond.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, who can forget her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/27/with-his-fiery-testimony-kavanaugh-appears-more-trump-like-than-ever\">extraordinary encounter</a> with <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/brett-kavanaugh\">Brett Kavanaugh</a></strong> at the supreme court justice\u2019s explosive confirmation hearings last September.

In part, she writes: </p> <p>In interviews throughout the Boston area, Warren\u2019s former students and colleagues described her as a \u201cpragmatic idealist\u201d whose life\u2019s work has centered on understanding and rooting out income inequality.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s had a very consistent, coherent, intellectual ideological position,\u201d said Barney Frank, a retired Massachusetts congressman who worked closely with Warren on financial reform.</p> <p>\u201cShe can claim to have been there when this critique of economic inequality, and the systematic problems that exacerbate it, wasn\u2019t fashionable.\u201d</p> <p>But Warren\u2019s official entry into the race has differed sharply from when she captured widespread liberal enthusiasm in her unlikely bid for the Senate seven years ago.</p> <p>The two-term senator will join a crowded Democratic primary field with no clear frontrunner \u2013 and several contenders jockeying to claim the progressive mantle that she aspires to grasp. She has also found herself contending with a lingering controversy for previously identifying as Native American over the course of nearly two decades.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c5db66ce4b00ef6acc6a30c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-08T17:06:08.311Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back from the rock to the hard place, Whitaker\u2019s just been admonished.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/woodruffbets/status/1093917121564811264\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Whitaker makes a snide remark about Rep.

      "bodyText": "Another Friday, another crisis in Virginia politics. We\u2019re shutting things down on the west coast, but here\u2019s your reminder of the major events of the day. Acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker testified before the House judiciary committee. Whitaker claimed that he never discussed the Russia investigation with Trump; Democrats were unimpressed and threatened a subpoena. A second allegation of sexual assault was leveled against Justin Fairfax, the lieutenant governor of Virginia. Fairfax denied the allegation and said he will not resign, despite immediate pressure to do so. The White House ignored a Friday deadline to deliver a report to Congress about the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Donald Trump went to the doctor and announced the location of his upcoming summit with Kim Jong Un. Happy Friday! In the latest dispatch from Friday night\u2019s executive time, Trump has issued another tweet about North Korea. The reference to North Korea becoming an economic \u201cRocket\u201d is a tad confusing. It\u2019s probably a riff off his own habit of referring to Kim Jong Un as \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d. Or perhaps Trump is tired of misinformed people suggesting that North Korea is currently a slightly peppery green. Donald Trump has just announced the location of the upcoming summit between the US and North Korea, and it\u2019s Hanoi, Vietnam. The date of the summit was already known. A Virginia lawmaker has now raised the prospect of impeachment if Lt Gov Justin Fairfax refuses to resign, according to CNN reporter Ryan Nobles. Patrick Hope is a Democratic member of the Virginia House of Delegates, the commonwealth\u2019s lower legislative body. The constitution of Virginia lays out a process for impeachment of top state officials for \u201cmalfeasance in office, corruption, neglect of duty, or other high crime or misdemeanor\u201d. Similarly to the federal process, the officials must be impeached by the House (of Delegates, in this case), and then tried by the Senate. A conviction requires a two-thirds vote by the Senate. Last Friday, when Governor Ralph Northam was the Virginia politician who appeared most likely to be impeached, the Washington Post interviewed legal experts about the chances of removing him from office. They noted that the language in the constitution is not particularly clear when it comes to defining what is and is not an impeachable offense. The article also notes that no governor of Virginia has ever been removed from office due to impeachment. The floodgates have opened on calls for Virginia lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax to step down. So far we\u2019ve heard from three Democratic senators who also happen to be running for president, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Elizabeth Warren. Of course, at this time last week, everyone and their junior senator was calling for Ralph Northam to step down, and he appears determined to ride out the storm of controversy around his medical school yearbook page, which includes a photo of a person in blackface next to a person wearing a Ku Klux Klan uniform. According to the Associated Press, Northam told his senior staff today that he plans to stay in office. Donald Trump has completed his annual trip to the doctor, and the early reviews are in: he\u2019s alive! A memo released by the president\u2019s acting physician, Sean P Conley, states that Trump was examined by Conley and 11 other specialists for four hours at Walter Reed medical center. Though light on detail (the report is still being finalized), the memo asserts that Trump is \u201cin very good health\u201d. Conley continued: \u201cI anticipate he will remain so for the duration of his Presidency, and beyond.\u201d Amy Klobuchar, a Democratic senator from Minnesota, is expected to announce a presidential run on Sunday. But two reports this week have cast something of a pall over the launch, with anonymous sources alleging that Klobuchar is an abusive boss. On Wednesday, HuffPost reported that Klobuchar\u2019s reputation as a boss had led at least three people to withdraw from consideration to run her campaign. The HuffPost report describes Klobuchar\u2019s as \u201chabitually demeaning and prone to bursts of cruelty\u201d, citing former staffers. The piece also acknowledged the complicated dynamics of reporting on female politicians. It noted that Klobuchar\u2019s senate office has \u201cconsistently\u201d high rates of staff turnover \u2013 an objective measure, though one whose causes are open to interpretation. Today, BuzzFeed News published its own report on Klobuchar-as-boss, and the details are pretty ugly. The BuzzFeed report is also based on anonymous interviews with former staff, but the outlet also reviewed emails from Klobuchar in which she \u201cregularly berated employees, often in all capital letters, over minor mistakes, misunderstandings, and misplaced commas\u201d. The BuzzFeed report also includes this troubling anecdote: She yelled, threw papers, and sometimes even hurled objects; one aide was accidentally hit with a flying binder, according to someone who saw it happen, though the staffer said the senator did not intend to hit anyone with the binder when she threw it. \u201cI cried. I cried, like, all the time,\u201d said one former staffer. In identical statements to BuzzFeed and HuffPost, Klobuchar\u2019s campaign said: Senator Klobuchar loves her staff \u2014 they are the reason she has gotten to where she is today. She has many staff who have been with her for years \u2014 including her Chief of Staff and her State Director, who have worked for her for 5 and 7 years respectively, as well as her political advisor Justin Buoen, who has worked for her for 14 years \u2014 and many who have gone on to do amazing things, from working in the Obama Administration (over 20 of them) to running for office to even serving as the Agriculture Commissioner for Minnesota. She is proud of them and the work they have done for Minnesota. Hello everyone, this is Julia Carrie Wong in San Francisco signing on to guide you through the rest of Friday\u2019s politics news. It was only last Friday that Virginia\u2019s lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, appeared poised to become the state\u2019s second ever African American governor amid a tsunami of calls for Ralph Northam\u2019s resignation. Now, in the wake of a second allegation of sexual assault, Fairfax is himself being pushed to resign, notably by former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, who just tweeted that he finds the allegations against Fairfax \u201cserious and credible\u201d. But it doesn\u2019t appear that Fairfax will go quietly. In a statement shared by NPR reporter Sarah McCammon on Twitter, the lieutenant governor denies the allegation, demands an investigation, claims that he is the victim of \u201ca vicious and coordinated smear campaign, and declares his intention to remain in office. The statement reads: I deny this latest unsubstantiated allegation. It is demonstrably false. I have never forced myself on anyone ever. I demand a full investigation into these unsubstantiated and false allegations. Such an investigation will confirm my account because I am telling the truth. I will clear my good name and I have nothing to hide. I have passed two full field background checks by the FBI and run for office in two highly contested elections with nothing like this raised before. It is obvious that a vicious and coordinated smear campaign is being orchestrated against me. I will not resign. It is worth noting that, despite Fairfax\u2019s characterization of the rape allegation as \u201cunsubstantiated,\u201d his accuser\u2019s attorney said that they possess corroborating statements from former classmates and emails and Facebook messages in which she told friends about the attack. Remember when Fridays used to be quiet? That was nice and quaint. I\u2019m handing over the keys of the blog to my trusted colleague on the West Coast, Julia Carrie Wong. She\u2019ll take you through the remaining events of the day before you (hopefully) kick off your weekend! But before I go, allow me to recap the main events of the day: Matt Whitaker, Donald Trump\u2019s controversial acting attorney general, testified before the House judiciary committee. In an explosive hearing led by the panel\u2019s Democrats, Whitaker claimed he never discussed the Russia investigation with Trump, nor the prospect of being pardoned; he also declined to explicitly state that the special counsel probe was not a \u2018witch hunt\u2019. It all ended with Democrats threatening to subpoena Whitaker, having found his responses inadequate. Jared Kushner is in hot water yet again following a report that Trump\u2019s re-election campaign paid the legal fees of the firm that retains Kushner as a client. Drain the swamp, anyone? A second woman has accused Justin Fairfax, Virginia\u2019s lieutenant governor, of sexual assault, adding to the political tsunami that has hit the state\u2019s top leaders. An attorney for the accuser, Meredith Watson, said in a letter that her client was raped by Fairfax while the two were students at Duke University in 2000. The White House skipped a Friday deadline in which the president was supposed to deliver a report to Congress making a determination as to whether Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman was directly involved in ordering the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. This won\u2019t sit well with lawmakers, who are mulling sanctions against the Saudi Kingdom. Stay tuned for more news and adios from Sabrina! Another woman has come forward to accuse Justin Fairfax, Virginia\u2019s embattled lieutenant governor, of sexual assault. An attorney for the woman, identified as Meredith Watson, released a statement alleging that Fairfax raped Watson in 2000 while they were both students at Duke University. \u201cAt this time, Ms. Watson is reluctantly coming forward out of a strong sense of civic duty and her belief that those seeking or serving in public office should be of the highest character,\u201d Watson\u2019s attorney, Nancy Erika Smith, said. \u201cShe has no interest in becoming a media personality or reliving the trauma that has greatly affected her life. Similarly, she is not seeking any financial damages.\u201d Smith added that Watson\u2019s legal team was in possession of emails and Facebook messages in which she had shared her account of the rape with friends, in addition to corroborating statements from former classmates. Fairfax has faced pressure to resign after Dr. Vanessa Tyson, a professor of politics, accused him of sexually assaulting her at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. Fairfax has denied the allegations against him. One of our readers rightly points out that the political crisis in Virginia is not unique to Democrats, even if their top leaders have been at its center. The top Republican in the state Senate is also facing controversy over racist photographs and slurs uncovered from a college yearbook at the time he was its editor. From the NYTimes: The senator, Thomas K. Norment Jr., who is the majority leader, was the managing editor of the 1968 Virginia Military Institute yearbook, which included slurs and images of students in blackface. Mr. Norment called the use of blackface \u201cabhorrent\u201d while pointing out that he did not take or appear in any of the photographs. What a mess indeed. The Matthew Whitaker hearing has come to a close with the same bang that kicked it off. Jerrold Nadler, the House judiciary chairman, told the acting AG his testimony was \u201cat best inconsistent\u201d and \u201cnot credible\u201d \u201cYou owe us answers,\u201d Nadler told Whitaker as he wrapped up the hearing. \u201cI fully intend to call you back,\u201d he added, \u201cunder subpoena if necessary\u201d. This is only just the beginning. Buckle up, friends! Taking a little breather from the Whitaker hearing to drop in on the very complex political situation in Virginia. You might recall the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, is refusing calls to resign amid a controversy over blackface; then his attorney general also admitted to wearing blackface, and the lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, was accused of sexual assault. Yeah, it\u2019s a lot... In any case, here\u2019s the latest from the AP: The political crisis in Virginia threatens to turn a state that has trended Democratic back into a battleground, a development that could complicate the party\u2019s effort to defeat President Donald Trump next year. Three of the state\u2019s top Democrats are engulfed in a scandal that has shaken the state government. Gov. Ralph Northam and Attorney General Mark Herring have admitted wearing blackface as young men in the 1980s. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, meanwhile, has been accused of sexually assaulting a woman in 2004, an allegation he denies. The men are resisting calls for their resignation. Virginia\u2019s increasingly diverse and urban population has fueled Democratic victories for a decade. But Democrats are anxious that the dizzying developments could suddenly halt their progress. The prospect of losing Virginia\u2019s 13 electoral votes would spread Democrats thin as they try to win back upper Midwest states that voted for Trump while making a push in GOP-leaning states like Georgia and Arizona. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t change the blue direction of the state long-term, but this certainly complicates things for Democrats in the immediate future,\u201d said Virginia native Carolyn Fiddler, a top operative at the DailyKos website, a force in liberal politics nationally.\u201d All around a bad situation from Democrats, that doesn\u2019t appear to be getting any better. And dare we ask if it could get any worse... Well, Matt Whitaker just claimed there was \u201cno family separation policy\u201d under the Trump administration. Except that there was, and the Trump administration enforced it as part of a bid to deter asylum-seekers from showing up at the US-Mexico border. They even referred to it as the \u201czero-tolerance policy\u201d (emphasis mine). In any case, when asked at the hearing by Representative Pramila Jaypal if he understood the magnitude of separating children from their parents, Whitaker replied: \u201cCongresswoman, I appreciate your passion for this issue.\u201d The acting AG also confirmed that the Justice Department was not tracking when a child was separated from his or her parents after crossing the border. The US government has acknowledged it does not know how many migrant children were separated from their parents at the border. Donald Trump appears to be thwarting a deadline set by Congress requiring that the White House send a report to US lawmakers determining whether Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince is personally responsible for the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The White House was due to deliver the report on Friday under a congressionally mandated deadline. Trump has in the past cast doubt on whether Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the execution of Khashoggi last October. According to a New York Times report published Thursday, US and foreign officials with direct knowledge of intelligence reports said bin Salman told a top aide he would use \u201ca bullet\u201d on Khashoggi one year before the journalist was killed. Trump\u2019s refusal to comply with the deadline could amplify frustration on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are eying sanctions that would punish those responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death and prohibit certain arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Whitaker was just asked about his recent comments that special counsel Robert Mueller will soon wrap up his investigation. \u201cBob Mueller is gonna finish his investigation when he wants to finish his investigation,\u201d the acting AG responded, noting his prior statement was simply his own view. Whitaker also said he has \u201cnot been part of any conversations, of any pardons\u201d with the president. Speaking of another impending government shutdown, Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign appears to be polling supporters on whether or not the president should declare a national emergency at the border. An email distributed by the campaign asks: \u201cShould President Trump declare a National Emergency to BUILD THE WALL?\u201d Respondents can record a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 vote, which as one can expect links to the Trump 2020 re-election website where you can also donate to his cause. Go figure! It\u2019s worth noting even some Republicans in Congress have warned Trump not to declare a national emergency, deeming it a power grab that could set a bad precedent for future presidents. But as we\u2019ve seen time and again, Trump isn\u2019t necessarily one to listen to members of his own party -- or any party, really. Is it just me, or is it rather odd to poll people in order to determine that something is an emergency? Just going to put that out there. It\u2019s not too late to grab a bag of popcorn and tune into this Whitaker hearing, folks. This exchange between Representative Hakeem Jeffries and the acting AG pretty much sums it up: \u201cKeep your hands off the Mueller investigation\u201d seems like a quote we will hear again. Congressional negotiators are working intensely behind closed doors to reach a deal that would avert another government shutdown on 15 February. Funding for the US government is due to expire in a week, based on the short-term agreement that last month brought the longest shutdown in US history to a close. The shutdown -- which was the third under Donald Trump\u2019s watch -- was caused by the president\u2019s insistence that Congress allocate $5.7b in funding toward a wall along the US-Mexico border. Trump has not backed down from that demand as a bipartisan group of lawmakers has been in talks on Capitol Hill about a potential compromise. It looks as though both sides might be willing to offer roughly $2b in border security for some kind of physical barrier. So the key questions now are: Is the money enough for Trump and will he insist that the language refer to the barriers as a \u2018wall\u2019? Are Democrats willing to accept funding for any kind of barrier, or is that still seen as conceding on the wall they so vehemently oppose? Time will tell. According to the Washington Post, Donald Trump employed so many undocumented immigrants that an entire town in Costa Rica basically lived off his paychecks. From the report: The Washington Post spoke with 16 men and women from Costa Rica and other Latin American countries, including six in Santa Teresa de Cajon, who said they were employed at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster. All of them said they worked for Trump without legal status \u2013 and that their managers knew. This hardly comes as a surprise \u2013 Trump has previously drawn scrutiny for employing undocumented immigrants at his properties, despite all his bellyaching over illegal immigration in the US. But it reinforces the extent to which Trump was willing to exploit the system for his own gain. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr, the president\u2019s sons who are currently running the family\u2019s organization, declined to comment on the Washington Post story. Nor did managers at the Bedminster golf course in question. I\u2019m just going to go out on a limb and ask: is it really that hard for one family to stay out of trouble? JUST IN: Federal prosecutors are investigating whether the National Enquirer\u2019s alleged threats against Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos violated a plea agreement between the tabloid\u2019s publisher and the southern district of New York. Federal prosecutors in the southern district of New York announced a cooperation agreement in December with American Media Company, Inc. (AMI), the publisher of the National Enquirer, pertaining to hush money paid to a woman who alleged to having an affair with Donald Trump. As part of the deal, the National Enquirer admitted to having made the payment as part of a practice known as \u2018catch-and-kill\u2019, in which the tabloid purchased exclusive rights to the woman\u2019s story but then refused to publish it. The woman in question, Karen McDougal, said she had an affair with Trump in 2006. The National Enquirer could now stand to lose immunity over its handling of the Bezos situation. Under the plea deal, the tabloid was directed to refrain from any illegal activity for a period of three years. You know what they say ... life comes at you fast. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has spent nearly $100,000 to pay legal bills to the firm representing Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser. Citing campaign finance records, ABC News reported that Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign made two payments to the firm, Winston &amp; Strawn LLP, of $55,330 and $42,574. According to ABC, the campaign expenditures were payments made to Abbe Lowell, Kushner\u2019s attorney, for legal fees. Kushner has primarily required legal counsel to deal with questioning stemming from the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the US election and potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Read the full ABC report here. Hi! Sabrina Siddiqui back in action here... A lot has happened today, and it\u2019s only just lunchtime here on the East Coast! Allow us to summarize the day\u2019s events so far: Trump\u2019s acting attorney general, Matt Whitaker, is partaking in a contentious hearing before the House judiciary committee on Capitol Hill. Whitaker has sparred with Democrats on the panel -- cutting them off at times in their questioning -- and claimed to have had not discussions with the president about overseeing the Russia investigation. The National Enquirer says it will \u201cthoroughly investigate\u201d claims by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos that he was the victim of an extortion plot. Bezos said Thursday the tabloid threatened to release nude photos of him if he did not issue a public statement absolving the Enquirer of allegations that its actions have been politically motivated. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said a woman assaulted her at a restaurant in October -- detailing an encounter in which the woman in question grabbed and shook Conway while yelling at her in front of her daughter. The woman is set to stand trial in March. Her lawyer disputes Conway\u2019s account. Ivanka Trump says she had minimal knowledge of discussions around a potential Trump Tower project in Moscow during the 2016 presidential election. In a rare interview, the president\u2019s daughter also said she had \u201czero concern\u201d that the Russia investigation would implicate her loved ones. 2020 Watch: Senator Elizabeth Warren is set to formally launch her presidential campaign on Saturday in her home state of Massachusetts; her colleague, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, is expected to announce her own bid for the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination on Sunday. Whew! You get all that? Stay tuned for more. And on Sunday, Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar is expected to launch her bid for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential election. If you think the official mention from her office that there will be hot cocoa, cookies and \u201cwarming stations\u201d at the event in Minneapolis sounds a bit too cuddly, consider that the weather forecast is predicting a high of just 18F with a brisk north-easterly breeze and snow showers. Klobuchar, 59, is the sixth prominent woman to wade into the primary contest, which features a record number of women vying for a major-party nomination. Unlike some of her fellow senators, Klobuchar has kept a low profile in Washington. She is neither the progressive firebrand that is Warren nor has the vast social media following that transformed Cory Booker into a star. Klobuchar is instead known a soft-spoken policymaker who has quietly built a network of supporters, in contrast with some of the Democratic contenders who have embraced confrontation with Trump head-on. The Democratic party has been somewhat torn over whether candidates should try and match Trump\u2019s bullying tactics or fall back upon Michelle Obama\u2019s 2016 advice: \u201cWhen they go low, we go high.\u201d Klobuchar suggested she would forge a middle ground, stating: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with, \u2018When they go low, we go low,\u2019 but I do agree that when they go low, we have to respond.\u201d Meanwhile, who can forget her extraordinary encounter with Brett Kavanaugh at the supreme court justice\u2019s explosive confirmation hearings last September. In quizzing the nominee about his alchohol history and habits, Klobuchar asked Kavanaugh, essentially, if he\u2019d ever been black-out drunk. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Have you?\u201d Kavanaugh retorted to a taken-aback Klobuchar. It was weird, but it put her on people\u2019s radar outside the Beltway. Wait! Lest you think it\u2019s all bald dudes all the time this morning, there\u2019s a hot weekend coming up in chilly places. Elizabeth Warren is tomorrow expected officially to announce her candidacy for the White House. She won\u2019t be doing it in Boston or Cambridge but in hard-bitten Lawrence, the mill town much closer to the New Hampshire border, which has certainly seen better days. Here\u2019s our Sabrina Siddiqui\u2019s dispatch today from Warren\u2019s backyard, as it were. In part, she writes: In interviews throughout the Boston area, Warren\u2019s former students and colleagues described her as a \u201cpragmatic idealist\u201d whose life\u2019s work has centered on understanding and rooting out income inequality. \u201cShe\u2019s had a very consistent, coherent, intellectual ideological position,\u201d said Barney Frank, a retired Massachusetts congressman who worked closely with Warren on financial reform. \u201cShe can claim to have been there when this critique of economic inequality, and the systematic problems that exacerbate it, wasn\u2019t fashionable.\u201d But Warren\u2019s official entry into the race has differed sharply from when she captured widespread liberal enthusiasm in her unlikely bid for the Senate seven years ago. The two-term senator will join a crowded Democratic primary field with no clear frontrunner \u2013 and several contenders jockeying to claim the progressive mantle that she aspires to grasp. She has also found herself contending with a lingering controversy for previously identifying as Native American over the course of nearly two decades. Back from the rock to the hard place, Whitaker\u2019s just been admonished. And you know it\u2019s big when it\u2019s GIANT. Tweeting, bigly: Oh, hang on, we should just cover this, sorry for the delay. Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, just pressed Matt Whitaker in the hearing on Capitol Hill about whether, as a private citizen prior to being appointed acting AG, he shared his private opinions about Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation with Donald Trump, the president\u2019s family, senior White House figures such as John Kelly or close allies such as Rudy Giuliani. Whitaker rambled pompously, scrutinizing the House committee over his glasses, and was accused of filibustering, before finally answering: \u201cNo I did not.\u201d If you wondered what happened to Ronny Jackson, Trump\u2019s former physician who gave the president an uncannily glowing report about his health last year and then departed under cloud, he has resurfaced. Trump has now made Jackson his assistant and chief medical adviser. Saturday\u2019s announcement by the White House follows Trump\u2019s decision to re-nominate Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson for a second star due to inaction by the previous Congress. Jackson\u2019s original nomination was put on hold last year after Trump nominated him to head the Veterans Affairs department. The navy doctor withdrew following allegations of professional misconduct, which the Pentagon continues to investigate. Jackson has denied any wrongdoing. The AP further writes that Trump is to be put through a round of medical tests at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, that will determine his weight, cholesterol, blood pressure and other health factors. Little more than a year ago, Trump\u2019s doctor declared him to be in \u201cexcellent health.\u201d But the president was directed to try to lose 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 6.8 kg) by eating better and starting to exercise. Aides said he now eats more fish than he used to but still enjoys steaks, well done with ketchup on the side, and fried potatoes prepared by the chefs at the White House and at the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Trump also has long had a well-documented fondness for fast food. Trump has admitted that he has not hewn closely to his diet plan. Nor has he been known to enter the White House gym for a workout. \u201cThe president received a diet and exercise plan last year after his annual physical, but the president admits he has not followed it religiously,\u201d said White House spokesman Hogan Gidley. At last year\u2019s physical, Trump weighed 239 pounds (108 kg) at last year\u2019s physical. His resting heart rate was 68 beats per minute (bpm), his blood pressure was 122/74, and his total cholesterol was 223 (HDL 67, LDL 143). In last year\u2019s exam, a stress test found above-average exercise capacity and a cognitive assessment was normal. Trump daily takes a 10 mg dose of Crestor to lower cholesterol, 81 mg of aspirin for cardiac health, and 1 mg of Propecia for prevention of male pattern hair loss. You have to wonder if there\u2019s an uneasy feeling in the pit of the president\u2019s stomach this morning. The federal government is one week from shutting down again, his controversial pick as acting AG, Whitaker, is on the grill on Capitol Hill and, you know, Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York are skating in ever tighter circles towards the Trump clan. But, more importantly, he\u2019s off to the doctor in just over an hour and he hasn\u2019t been eating his greens or taking to the jogging trails, even between extensive bouts of \u201cexecutive time\u201d (which our David Smith examines more fully here.) \u201cThe president received a diet and exercise plan last year after his annual physical, but the president admits he has not followed it religiously,\u201d said White House spokesman Hogan Gidley, according to the Associated Press. The word \u201creligiously\u201d feels like a cover-your-behind after thought. Trump, 72, will attend his annual physical exam at 12.45PM In news closely related to all the other aspects and characters in this hot tangle, the Guardian has an exclusive (aka sneak peek) this morning on the forthcoming book by former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe. Our Jon Swaine writes that McCabe claims that the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, privately complained that he was ordered by Donald Trump to write the notorious memo justifying the firing of the FBI director James Comey. McCabe states that Rosenstein, who has publicly defended the memo, lamented that the president had directed him to rationalize Comey\u2019s dismissal, which is now the subject of inquiries into whether Trump obstructed justice. Rosenstein made his remarks in a private meeting at the justice department on 12 May 2017, according to McCabe\u2019s memoir, which also accuses Trump of operating like a criminal mob boss and of unleashing a \u201cstrain of insanity\u201d in American public life. Per the Guardian\u2019s scoop, McCabe recalls Rosenstein being \u201cglassy-eyed\u201d, visibly upset and sounding emotional after coming to believe the White House was using him as a scapegoat for Comey\u2019s dismissal. \u201cHe said it wasn\u2019t his idea. The president had ordered him to write the memo justifying the firing,\u201d McCabe writes. Rosenstein said he was having trouble sleeping, McCabe writes. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here that I can trust,\u201d he is quoted as saying. The book, The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump, is due on sale later this month. Former and, one could add, formidable federal prosecutor and Stanford law lecturer Elizabeth de la Vega\u2019s tweet is to the point: \u201cMy question for Whitaker: \u201cLast week, you volunteered that the Special Counsel investigation was wrapping up. What was your basis for saying that?\u201d Some wits are asking on social meeja who should play Whitaker on Saturday Night Live. Answers on a postcard, please to @joannawalters13 or @GuardianUS. Kate McKinnon\u2019s Jeff Sessions is hard to beat. Mr @waltshaub goes on to say: The heroes of the story, as @RepJerryNadler said this morning, are the DOJ CAREER ETHICS OFFICIALS who, knowing the history of POTUS and his congressional allies for going after people who stand up for the rule of law, told Whitaker to recuse. Please retweet this to honor them. The former director of the Office for Government Ethics, Walter Shaub, who announced his resignation in July, 2017, and lobbed grenades at Donald Trump as he marched out the door, is tweeting about Matt Whitaker at the House hearing this morning. He mentions the most significant development of the hearing so far, that Whitaker claims he has not told the president \u201cor senior White House officials\u201d anything about Robert Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation. Economist and NYT columnist Paul Krugman generously tweets a link to the Washington Post and comments: \u201cI never expected to see Jeff Bezos emerge as a hero of democracy.\u201d The Wall Street Journal now reports that the National Enquirer publisher says it acted lawfully and will conduct an internal probe after Jeff Bezos claimed that it attempted to blackmail him. In case you missed it, Jeff Bezos came forward on Thursday with explosive allegations on Thursday that the National Enquirer threatened to publish nude photos of him -- unless the Amazon CEO stated publicly that the tabloid\u2019s work was not politically motivated. You can catch up on the whole story here, which raised eyebrows not in the last because American Media Inc., the National Enquirer\u2019s publisher, is run by David Pecker, a close ally of Donald Trump\u2019s. Reminder: Pecker is the same guy who quashed the account of Karen McDougal, a woman who alleged to having an affair with Trump, by buying the rights to her story and then refusing to publish it in a practice known as \u2018catch-and-kill\u2019. Anyway, if you\u2019re trying to figure out what the heck is going on, much like the rest of us, don\u2019t ask the White House. Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, told reporters on Friday he \u201cwasn\u2019t sure\u201d if Trump was aware of the Bezos/Enquirer drama. He also said the White House had no plans to get involved in an issue \u201cbetween Jeff Bezos and a tabloid magazine\u201d. Worth noting, of course, that Trump has a long-running feud with Bezos and has repeatedly attacked the executive and Washington Post owner on Twitter. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway has said she was grabbed and shaken by a woman while at a restaurant with her teenager daughter last year. Conway detailed the alleged assault in an interview with CNN on Friday, stating she was approached at a Mexican restaurant in the DC suburbs in October by a woman who was \u201cscreaming her head off\u201d. \u201cSomebody was grabbing me from behind, grabbing my arms, and was shaking me to the point where I felt maybe somebody was hugging me,\u201d Conway said. \u201cShe was out of control. I don\u2019t even know how to explain her to you. She was just, her whole face was terror and anger. She was right here, and my daughter was right there. She ought to pay for that.\u201d Conway said she dialed 911 at the time of the incident. A 63-year old woman by the name of Mary Elizabeth Inabinett was charged in November with second-degree assault and disorderly conduct. A lawyer for Inabinett, who is due to stand trial in March, disputed Conway\u2019s account and said his client was expressing her \u201cfirst amendment right\u201d. She plans to plead not guilty. Read more here. As Matt Whitaker\u2019s testimony on Capitol Hill begins, the House judiciary committee chairman, Jerrold Nadler, issued a sharp warning to the acting attorney general that regardless of his answers, the panel would seek out the truth. Read the key part of Nadler\u2019s opening statement here: \u201cYour failure to respond fully to our questions here today in no way limits the ability of this committee to get the answers in the long run \u2013 even if you are a private citizen when we finally learn the truth. And although I am willing to work with the department to obtain this information, I will not allow that process to drag out for weeks and months. The time for this administration to postpone accountability is over. \u201cWe have laid all of the groundwork for this hearing out in the open. We have given you months to prepare. We have publicly documented every request we have made to you. We have provided our Republican colleagues with a meaningful opportunity to weigh in on the process. We have nothing to hide from you. We hope you have nothing to hide from us.\u201d Tough crowd, amirite? A look at the front page of the Detroit Free Press memorializing John Dingell, the legendary US congressman who passed away on Thursday. Dingell, who died at age 92, was the longest-serving member of Congress in US history. His political career stretched nearly six decades representing a southeastern district of Michigan in the House of Representatives, spanning the administration of Dwight Eisenhower to that of Barack Obama. Ivanka Trump has said she knew \u201calmost nothing\u201d about the prospective Trump Tower project in Moscow that her father was pursuing during 2016 presidential election. \u201cWe were an active business,\u201d Trump said during an interview that aired Friday on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America, while adding her knowledge of the project amounted to \u201cliterally almost nothing\u201d. \u201cThere was never a binding contract. I never talked to the \u2013 with a third party outside of the organization about it,\u201d Trump, who serves as a White House adviser, said. \u201cIt was one of \u2013 I mean, we could have had 40 or 50 deals like that, that were floating around, that somebody was looking at. Nobody visited it to see if it was worth our time. So this was not exactly like an advanced project.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments mark her first public statement on the matter since it was revealed that discussions to build a potential Trump Tower in Moscow continued well into the campaign, despite the president\u2019s insistence he had no business dealings in Russia. Donald Trump\u2019s former attorney, Michael Cohen, has admitted to lying to Congress about the timeline of the project and the extent of relevant conversations with the Russians during the campaign. Asked if she was concerned any of her loved ones would be implicated in the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation, Trump said: \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m really not.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing there, yet it\u2019s created weeks and weeks and months of headlines,\u201d she said. \u201cSo no, I have zero concern.\u201d Trump also downplayed the significance of doing business in Moscow, stating: \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about Iran. It was Russia.\u201d The Mueller investigation has brought charges against 37 individuals and companies, including several former Trump campaign officials. Donald Trump\u2019s acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, will testify before the House judiciary committee on Friday following a dispute between the panel\u2019s Democrats that left his appearance in doubt. Whitaker will be the first Trump cabinet official to be brought before a House committee led by Democrats, who are eager to ask the controversial acting attorney gneral about his views on the special counsel investigation and his interactions with the president. Whitaker\u2019s appointment to replace Jeff Sessions, who was fired in November, was decried by some legal experts as unconstitutional. Democrats also sounded the alarm over Whitaker\u2019s refusal to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation, given his prior criticism of the special counsel led by Robert Mueller. Whitaker\u2019s appearance comes after he threatened not to testify absent written assurances from the panel\u2019s chairman that he would not be subpoenaed before or during the hearing. Representative Jerrold Nadler, the judiciary committee\u2019s chairman, responded by stating he did not see a reason for a subpoena if Whitaker answered questions from the panel\u2019s members. Whitaker\u2019s testimony comes as the Senate is prepared to confirm William Barr as the next attorney general. Good morning everyone and happy Friday! (Fri-yay.) Sabrina Siddiqui here, taking you through the events of what promises to be another action-packed day. All eyes are on Donald Trump\u2019s acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, who is poised to testify before the Democratic-led House judiciary committee. There\u2019s also a rare interview from Ivanka Trump, in which the president\u2019s daughter says she has \u201czero concern\u201d about Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia (little does she know...!) and an ongoing controversy in Virginia\u2019s statewide leadership over race and sexual assault. Oh, and Congress has one more week to pass a funding bill to avert yet another government shutdown. Sound like a lot? That\u2019s because it is.",

Horse racing is an industry built on selling dreams, however fanciful, so its inhabitants are readily able to persuade themselves that everything will turn out all right, even as the bad news accumulates.</p> \n<p>On Friday that bad news took the form of three new confirmed cases of equine influenza in active racehorses, taking the total to six. Racing professionals could reassure themselves with the thought that all six horses are based in the same stable, that of Cheshire-based Donald McCain. Perhaps the disease had not spread outside his yard. Perhaps this had all been caused by a single bad batch of the anti-flu vaccine which so many trainers give their charges at around this time of year. That would be much better than the alternative, that this is the emergence of a new strain of the flu virus which can defeat existing vaccines.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/08/equine-flu-outbreak-spreads-horse-racing-stables-lockdown\">Equine flu crisis deepens as fresh case suspected at second unrelated stable</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But last night evidence that could squash such comforting theories was on its way from Durham to a Newmarket lab. It took the form of three samples from horses at Rebecca Menzies\u2019 yard, reported to racing\u2019s ruling body as exhibiting symptoms of EI. Menzies had runners on Tuesday and Wednesday, when they rubbed shoulders, hopefully in a merely figurative sense, with horses from 50 other stables, all of which are now part of the lockdown paralysing the sport.</p> \n<p>For the time being racing could theoretically resume on Wednesday but any new confirmed cases at yards other than McCain\u2019s would put that in jeopardy.

      "bodyText": "There is always hope. Horse racing is an industry built on selling dreams, however fanciful, so its inhabitants are readily able to persuade themselves that everything will turn out all right, even as the bad news accumulates. On Friday that bad news took the form of three new confirmed cases of equine influenza in active racehorses, taking the total to six. Racing professionals could reassure themselves with the thought that all six horses are based in the same stable, that of Cheshire-based Donald McCain. Perhaps the disease had not spread outside his yard. Perhaps this had all been caused by a single bad batch of the anti-flu vaccine which so many trainers give their charges at around this time of year. That would be much better than the alternative, that this is the emergence of a new strain of the flu virus which can defeat existing vaccines. But last night evidence that could squash such comforting theories was on its way from Durham to a Newmarket lab. It took the form of three samples from horses at Rebecca Menzies\u2019 yard, reported to racing\u2019s ruling body as exhibiting symptoms of EI. Menzies had runners on Tuesday and Wednesday, when they rubbed shoulders, hopefully in a merely figurative sense, with horses from 50 other stables, all of which are now part of the lockdown paralysing the sport. For the time being racing could theoretically resume on Wednesday but any new confirmed cases at yards other than McCain\u2019s would put that in jeopardy. In the meantime the logistics of taking and testing samples from a four-figure number of horses must be close to overwhelming. The Gloucestershire-based Kim Bailey, who is as yet not on lockdown, reported through his blog what he had learned from talking to less fortunate rivals about their experience of the testing. \u201cIt was soon obvious that there were not enough swabs to go around and probably not enough vets either,\u201d Bailey wrote. \u201cPersonally I don\u2019t believe we will race next week. I do believe we will race shortly after, providing all the thousands of swabs taken show up to be clean.\u201d But Bailey is possibly more pessimistic, by temperament, than most trainers. \u201cThey\u2019re coping pretty well, on the whole,\u201d said Rupert Arnold at the National Trainers\u2019 Federation. \u201cThey all seem to be supportive of how it\u2019s being handled and very keen that everybody observes the biosecurity guidelines.

      "body": "<p>In retrospect, the steps that brought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/pawel-pawlikowski\" title=\"\">Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski</a> back to his native Warsaw seven years ago sound something like fate. He had been uprooted from his home city at 14 in 1971 when his parents divorced and his mother abruptly married an Englishman, spiriting Pawlikowski, without papers, to London. Although he had gone back to Poland to visit family during the Solidarity years and after the Wall came down, the thought of living back near his childhood home came as a surprise.</p> <p>Not long after his 2004 film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/oct/24/philipfrench\" title=\"\">My Summer of Love</a></em> won a Bafta as best British film, Pawlikowski suffered tragedy with the sudden death of his Russian wife. He took himself away from film-making for five years to devote himself to seeing their two teenage children through school in Oxford. He then based himself for a couple of years in Paris, where he made <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/16/woman-in-the-fifth-review\" title=\"\">The Woman </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/16/woman-in-the-fifth-review\" title=\"\">in the Fifth</a></em>, an anguished and sometimes impenetrable tale of obsession featuring Ethan Hawke and Kristin Scott Thomas. \u201cI wanted to make a commercial film and it became about the least commercial film imaginable,\u201d he says now, with a smile. He felt alien in Paris, still undone by grief, and all that came through in the film. \u201cIt became very personal strangely.\u201d</p> <p>Pawlikowski\u2019s reaction to that experience was to head home, \u201cto solid ground\u201d; but when he thought about it, he discovered that meant Poland, not England. He spent several months driving out from a friend\u2019s flat near his old home in Warsaw to the countryside that had hardly changed since his childhood. The result of those journeys into the interior has been two of the most singular and affecting films of recent years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Poland I was able to tell stories in which history has a real impact</p> <footer> <cite>Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The first, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/ida-pawel-pawlikowski-nun-road-movie\" title=\"\">Ida</a></em>, the story of a young Polish novice nun who unearths the tragic secrets of her Jewish past, won Pawlikowski an Academy award for best foreign language film in 2015. The second, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/11/cold-war-review-wounded-love-and-state-sponsored-fear-in-1940s-poland\" title=\"\">Cold War</a></em>, which reflects in part on his parents\u2019 tumultuous marriage, has been shortlisted in that Oscar category again this year, while Pawlikowski is among the nominees for best director (an accolade he also received for the film at Cannes). He is nominated in the same categories \u2013 foreign language film and director - at this year\u2019s Baftas too, where <em>Cold War</em> is also up for best screenplay. </p> <p>The recognition was unexpected, he says. He had made <em>Ida</em> to get as far away as possible from Hollywood and that red-carpet kind of world. \u201cBack to Poland, no stars, no expectations and a landscape I really cared about,\u201d he says.</p> <p>I caught up with him late last month on an overnight stay in London where he was attending another awards ceremony, the Critics Circle Awards. He is an immediately engaging presence, thoughtfully confessional, dressed in black, with a ready smile.</p> <p>We talked first about the ways returning to Poland had freed him to make the films he had always wanted to make (when he came to London he found his \u201ccinematic fatherland\u201d in Italian neo-realism and French New Wave films). Returning to central Europe clarified that. \u201cIn going back to Poland I was able to tell stories in which history has a real impact on what people do,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is something I felt I could never do in England. History in the UK is so diffuse and people have such different experiences.\u201d</p> <p>Pawlikowski\u2019s early documentary films \u2013 which saw him go on a fantastical trip up the Volga with the hard-drinking Russian novelist Victor Erofeyev, as well as exploring the historic forces that led to the siege of Sarajevo \u2013 represented a different kind of response to that past: \u201cMy real interest was in what the cold war left behind. The ruins of Marxism.\u201d With <em>Ida</em>, and then <em>Cold War</em>, he has followed those currents back to source.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvPkDdFeTk8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BvPkDdFeTk8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Official trailer for Cold War.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It seemed to make sense to him to film that world as he remembered it and imagined it, in black and white. He now sees that part of his motivation was to bring to life the family photograph albums that he carries with him wherever he lives. Pictures that contain \u201cworlds with very few objects; two, three things that suggest a hell of a lot\u201d.</p> <p>At the awards the previous evening he had been talking to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/pedroalmodovar\" title=\"\">Pedro Almod\u00f3var</a>. The Spanish director had explained how, when he was growing up, his mother was always dressed in black and his world of La Mancha was always monochrome. The explosion of garish colour in his film-making was his reaction to that. \u201cWhereas with me,\u201d Pawlikowski says, \u201cI was separated from that black and white world, so I guess I have wanted to return to it.\u201d</p> <p>For \u201cabout half a day\u201d he thought about making <em>Cold War</em> in colour. Because the film features one of the folk dancing groups that were used as nationalist propaganda by the communists, he thought about filming in that washed-out technicolor of the Soviets, but that quickly felt too contrived.</p> <p>Pawlikowski\u2019s mother, Zula, was a ballerina, and had some history with those fake folk groups that were a feature of the TV and radio of his youth. That memory provided one way into his recollection of his parents\u2019 marriage. The other was an enforced exile that his father, Wiktor, a doctor, endured for a while after walking across the border from East Germany.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"caf0bd29da09e8b721997887277a5ce0b913e1a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caf0bd29da09e8b721997887277a5ce0b913e1a1/0_248_5140_3085/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kristin Scott Thomas in Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski\u2019s 2011 film The Woman in the Fifth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kristin Scott Thomas in Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski\u2019s 2011 film The Woman in the Fifth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore collection Ltd/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s by no means a blow-by-blow of their real story. \u201cThere was always drama,\u201d Pawlikowski, an only child, says. \u201cMother disappeared. Then Father left the country. And then my mother took me to meet an English guy she had met; I never knew we were staying abroad for good. Then they both left the people they had married, met up, and started to live together again in Germany. Then from the mid-1980s they were both quite ill and they became this very beautiful loving couple, which made no sense to anyone who had seen the previous 35 years. They were tender, and they knew they had no one but each other.\u201d</p> <p>Where did he fit in?</p> <p>\u201cAs a kid I was a bone of contention, maybe. At the same time, growing up in socialist Poland, you had street life, I had a gang of friends, a band. Coming here not speaking a word of English, that was the real trauma.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Coming here, not speaking a word of English \u2013 that was the real trauma</p> <footer> <cite>Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Zula and Wiktor \u201cput an end to themselves\u201d in a pact, in 1989, just before the Wall came down. Zula had scoliosis and three operations that went wrong. Wiktor had three heart attacks and smoked and drank just the same. \u201cSo they just took leave in a peaceful way,\u201d Pawlikowski says.</p> <p>He had not known they would go through with that plan, and it left a huge gap in his life, one that he has partly filled, now, with his film. \u201cWe had been a trio,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about it for a long time as a story as such. But then I realised in my work I was constantly drawn to these kinds of love stories. I was offered the chance to do a film about Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath at one point and I was very tempted for a while. And I realised my parents\u2019 story was the matrix of all my stories.\u201d</p> <p>Music becomes the soundtrack to their combat. The folk music is counterpointed with the jazz that became the music of rebellion in Poland after Stalinism. Pawlikowski\u2019s camera is entranced by that contrast. \u201cI went to see live performances of this surviving folk ensemble. Which was weird but really rousing. I loved looking behind the scenes. The changing rooms, everyone rushing around. All fake but also no fakery of any kind.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"331ffa97cada069d7d504253d994c5a67ee79336\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/331ffa97cada069d7d504253d994c5a67ee79336/0_46_1874_1124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Natalie Press and Emily Blunt in Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski\u2019s 2004 film My Summer of Love.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natalie Press and Emily Blunt in Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski\u2019s 2004 film My Summer of Love.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AF archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both of his films have touched nerves in Poland. The resurgent Catholic far-right tried to get <em>Ida</em> banned or disqualified from prizes because of a perceived \u201canti-Polish\u201d sentiment. Pawlikowski was blindsided by the intensity of that reaction. \u201cWith each award it won they got angrier,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In fact, the film could hardly be more nuanced in its treatment of his country\u2019s complex history. Pawlikowski is pathologically opposed to the didactic: \u201cBut the thing is when you deal with humans and don\u2019t foreground politics, perhaps the politics become stronger.\u201d</p> <p>The reaction to <em>Ida</em> has not stopped nearly a million people seeing <em>Cold War</em> in cinemas in Poland since it opened in June. Although Zula and Wiktor\u2019s love affair explored some of the extremes of their historical and political moment, \u201ceveryone can identify with some fragment of that history,\u201d he suggests.</p> <p>And what would his parents have made of it?</p> <p>\u201cI think they would have liked it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s short and it\u2019s witty here and there.

He had been uprooted from his home city at 14 in 1971 when his parents divorced and his mother abruptly married an Englishman, spiriting Pawlikowski, without papers, to London. Although he had gone back to Poland to visit family during the Solidarity years and after the Wall came down, the thought of living back near his childhood home came as a surprise. Not long after his 2004 film My Summer of Love won a Bafta as best British film, Pawlikowski suffered tragedy with the sudden death of his Russian wife. He took himself away from film-making for five years to devote himself to seeing their two teenage children through school in Oxford. He then based himself for a couple of years in Paris, where he made The Woman in the Fifth, an anguished and sometimes impenetrable tale of obsession featuring Ethan Hawke and Kristin Scott Thomas. \u201cI wanted to make a commercial film and it became about the least commercial film imaginable,\u201d he says now, with a smile. He felt alien in Paris, still undone by grief, and all that came through in the film. \u201cIt became very personal strangely.\u201d Pawlikowski\u2019s reaction to that experience was to head home, \u201cto solid ground\u201d; but when he thought about it, he discovered that meant Poland, not England. He spent several months driving out from a friend\u2019s flat near his old home in Warsaw to the countryside that had hardly changed since his childhood. The result of those journeys into the interior has been two of the most singular and affecting films of recent years. The first, Ida, the story of a young Polish novice nun who unearths the tragic secrets of her Jewish past, won Pawlikowski an Academy award for best foreign language film in 2015. The second, Cold War, which reflects in part on his parents\u2019 tumultuous marriage, has been shortlisted in that Oscar category again this year, while Pawlikowski is among the nominees for best director (an accolade he also received for the film at Cannes). He is nominated in the same categories \u2013 foreign language film and director - at this year\u2019s Baftas too, where Cold War is also up for best screenplay. The recognition was unexpected, he says. He had made Ida to get as far away as possible from Hollywood and that red-carpet kind of world. \u201cBack to Poland, no stars, no expectations and a landscape I really cared about,\u201d he says. I caught up with him late last month on an overnight stay in London where he was attending another awards ceremony, the Critics Circle Awards. He is an immediately engaging presence, thoughtfully confessional, dressed in black, with a ready smile. We talked first about the ways returning to Poland had freed him to make the films he had always wanted to make (when he came to London he found his \u201ccinematic fatherland\u201d in Italian neo-realism and French New Wave films). Returning to central Europe clarified that. \u201cIn going back to Poland I was able to tell stories in which history has a real impact on what people do,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is something I felt I could never do in England. History in the UK is so diffuse and people have such different experiences.\u201d Pawlikowski\u2019s early documentary films \u2013 which saw him go on a fantastical trip up the Volga with the hard-drinking Russian novelist Victor Erofeyev, as well as exploring the historic forces that led to the siege of Sarajevo \u2013 represented a different kind of response to that past: \u201cMy real interest was in what the cold war left behind. The ruins of Marxism.\u201d With Ida, and then Cold War, he has followed those currents back to source. It seemed to make sense to him to film that world as he remembered it and imagined it, in black and white. He now sees that part of his motivation was to bring to life the family photograph albums that he carries with him wherever he lives. Pictures that contain \u201cworlds with very few objects; two, three things that suggest a hell of a lot\u201d. At the awards the previous evening he had been talking to Pedro Almod\u00f3var. The Spanish director had explained how, when he was growing up, his mother was always dressed in black and his world of La Mancha was always monochrome. The explosion of garish colour in his film-making was his reaction to that. \u201cWhereas with me,\u201d Pawlikowski says, \u201cI was separated from that black and white world, so I guess I have wanted to return to it.\u201d For \u201cabout half a day\u201d he thought about making Cold War in colour. Because the film features one of the folk dancing groups that were used as nationalist propaganda by the communists, he thought about filming in that washed-out technicolor of the Soviets, but that quickly felt too contrived. Pawlikowski\u2019s mother, Zula, was a ballerina, and had some history with those fake folk groups that were a feature of the TV and radio of his youth. That memory provided one way into his recollection of his parents\u2019 marriage. The other was an enforced exile that his father, Wiktor, a doctor, endured for a while after walking across the border from East Germany. It\u2019s by no means a blow-by-blow of their real story. \u201cThere was always drama,\u201d Pawlikowski, an only child, says. \u201cMother disappeared. Then Father left the country. And then my mother took me to meet an English guy she had met; I never knew we were staying abroad for good. Then they both left the people they had married, met up, and started to live together again in Germany. Then from the mid-1980s they were both quite ill and they became this very beautiful loving couple, which made no sense to anyone who had seen the previous 35 years. They were tender, and they knew they had no one but each other.\u201d Where did he fit in? \u201cAs a kid I was a bone of contention, maybe. At the same time, growing up in socialist Poland, you had street life, I had a gang of friends, a band. Coming here not speaking a word of English, that was the real trauma.\u201d Zula and Wiktor \u201cput an end to themselves\u201d in a pact, in 1989, just before the Wall came down. Zula had scoliosis and three operations that went wrong. Wiktor had three heart attacks and smoked and drank just the same. \u201cSo they just took leave in a peaceful way,\u201d Pawlikowski says. He had not known they would go through with that plan, and it left a huge gap in his life, one that he has partly filled, now, with his film. \u201cWe had been a trio,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about it for a long time as a story as such. But then I realised in my work I was constantly drawn to these kinds of love stories. I was offered the chance to do a film about Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath at one point and I was very tempted for a while. And I realised my parents\u2019 story was the matrix of all my stories.\u201d Music becomes the soundtrack to their combat. The folk music is counterpointed with the jazz that became the music of rebellion in Poland after Stalinism. Pawlikowski\u2019s camera is entranced by that contrast. \u201cI went to see live performances of this surviving folk ensemble. Which was weird but really rousing. I loved looking behind the scenes. The changing rooms, everyone rushing around. All fake but also no fakery of any kind.\u201d Both of his films have touched nerves in Poland. The resurgent Catholic far-right tried to get Ida banned or disqualified from prizes because of a perceived \u201canti-Polish\u201d sentiment. Pawlikowski was blindsided by the intensity of that reaction. \u201cWith each award it won they got angrier,\u201d he says. In fact, the film could hardly be more nuanced in its treatment of his country\u2019s complex history. Pawlikowski is pathologically opposed to the didactic: \u201cBut the thing is when you deal with humans and don\u2019t foreground politics, perhaps the politics become stronger.\u201d The reaction to Ida has not stopped nearly a million people seeing Cold War in cinemas in Poland since it opened in June. Although Zula and Wiktor\u2019s love affair explored some of the extremes of their historical and political moment, \u201ceveryone can identify with some fragment of that history,\u201d he suggests. And what would his parents have made of it? \u201cI think they would have liked it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s short and it\u2019s witty here and there. And they both ended up looking pretty glamorous.\u201d",
