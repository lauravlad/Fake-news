      "bodyText": "Tory leadership candidates have insisted there must be no unchallenged \u201ccoronation\u201d for frontrunner Boris Johnson at the latest round of hustings. Senior cabinet ministers were reported to have hatched plans to force other candidates to withdraw from the race after Johnson comfortably topped the poll in the first ballot of MPs this week. Among the rivals condemning the revelation were the home secretary, Sajid Javid, and Rory Stewart, who both insisted there must be a proper contest. As he arrived at leadership hustings for the party grassroots organised by the National Conservative Convention on Saturday, Javid said senior figures should learn from the mistakes of the last leadership contest in which Theresa May went through without opposition after Andrea Leadsom dropped out. \u201cThe party and the country deserve a good choice,\u201d he told reporters outside the event. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see a coronation. There needs to be a proper process that\u2019s followed through. \u201cWe had a coronation the last time. That didn\u2019t work out well so let\u2019s not make the same mistake again.\u201d Stewart, the international development secretary, said: \u201cThe members of the Conservative party, who are wise, sensible, experienced people, deserve to have a choice. \u201cWe should have learned from the last time round coronations are not the way to do democratic politics.\u201d Johnson, who has been criticised by his fellow candidates for his reluctance to appear on television debates and submit to greater public scrutiny, avoided reporters after his Range Rover parked at a side door at a London hotel where the event was held. Stewart, something of an outsider in the contest and among the keenest critics of Johnson, accused the frontrunner of adopting a presidential approach. \u201cThe whole genius of British politics is that we don\u2019t behave like American presidents sweeping up in a motorcade. We\u2019re all about talking to people,\u201d he said. On Sunday, Channel 4 will represent the former foreign secretary and London mayor with an empty podium after he declined an invitation to participate in a television debate with his five remaining rivals. Earlier, the former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab lashed out at Johnson, claiming that party members would reject a leader who could be viewed as part of the \u201cprivileged elite\u201d and questioning his \u201cmettle\u201d to be prime minister. Asked how he would stop Johnson from winning as he left he hustings, Raab said: \u201cWe should have proper scrutiny of everyone. The longer this goes on, the more the underdog gets their shot.\u201d The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, took a less critical approach, refusing to say whether Johnson should take the blame for Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s detention in Iran. On her latest decision to go on hunger strike \u2013 which her husband will also take part in from London \u2013 he added: \u201cOur message to Iran is whatever the disagreements you may have with the United Kingdom, there is an innocent woman at the heart of this.\u201d",
