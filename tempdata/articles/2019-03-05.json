So where do they turn? Youth centres have closed and other public facilities are increasingly becoming something which only the well-off can afford. Street gangs \u2013 and thence knife crime \u2013 are the last refuge of a disenchanted generation who feel no hope of joining the mainstream and so seek sanctuary among friends on the streets, the only place they feel they belong.<br><strong>Eileen Peck</strong><br><em>Benfleet, Essex</em></p> <p>\u2022 To end the knife-crime crisis, first call it what it is: a national murder crisis. The government must recognise that to end it quickly will require spending a huge amount of money, and must resolve to borrow what is needed.</p> <p>Take Bernard Hogan-Howe\u2019s advice to appoint a tsar to lead the end-it-quickly campaign. Announce a knives and guns amnesty with a reward for every weapon handed in. Invite recently retired policemen and women to rejoin the force and reward them for doing so.</p> <p>Urge headteachers to hold lessons on the crisis. Organise public meetings. Use compulsory purchase orders to buy empty buildings and convert them into youth centres. Invite former youth leaders and volunteers to help run them. That could be a start.<br><strong>Chris Birch</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The increase in the loss of lives through knife crime is truly shocking, as indeed is the government\u2019s lack of any meaningful attempts to tackle it and the prime minister\u2019s persistent ostrich impression regarding the shortage of police officers.

      "bodyText": "We can skirt around the causes of knife crime in the UK (Outrage at May\u2019s denial of austerity link to stabbings, 5 March) but we need to look more deeply and recognise it as a symptom of a sick society where the economy drives us all to aspire to a life of excessive material consumption but where a huge proportion of the population are left behind with no expectation that they can live up to the \u201cgood life\u201d as depicted by a wealthy elite. How does a young man feel when he lives in poverty but is drip-fed messages that he should aspire to become rich, drive a Lamborghini and live a life of luxury? With the massive reduction of standards in state education and with social mobility a thing of the past, we live in an ever more obscenely unequal society where young people see no chance of joining the \u201cdominant culture\u201d. So where do they turn? Youth centres have closed and other public facilities are increasingly becoming something which only the well-off can afford. Street gangs \u2013 and thence knife crime \u2013 are the last refuge of a disenchanted generation who feel no hope of joining the mainstream and so seek sanctuary among friends on the streets, the only place they feel they belong. Eileen Peck Benfleet, Essex \u2022 To end the knife-crime crisis, first call it what it is: a national murder crisis. The government must recognise that to end it quickly will require spending a huge amount of money, and must resolve to borrow what is needed. Take Bernard Hogan-Howe\u2019s advice to appoint a tsar to lead the end-it-quickly campaign. Announce a knives and guns amnesty with a reward for every weapon handed in. Invite recently retired policemen and women to rejoin the force and reward them for doing so. Urge headteachers to hold lessons on the crisis. Organise public meetings. Use compulsory purchase orders to buy empty buildings and convert them into youth centres. Invite former youth leaders and volunteers to help run them. That could be a start. Chris Birch London \u2022 The increase in the loss of lives through knife crime is truly shocking, as indeed is the government\u2019s lack of any meaningful attempts to tackle it and the prime minister\u2019s persistent ostrich impression regarding the shortage of police officers. What is also shocking however, is how easy it is to obtain weapons. They are readily available on the internet and through auction houses. While kitchen knives are obviously impossible to control, a starting point might be to stop people profiting from knife crime by selling knives on the open market in plain sight. No amount of checks on the purchaser will stop these weapons being passed on to someone else, so let\u2019s put an end to their sale. After all, what kind of person is it that wants to own a deadly weapon? They would be harder to obtain and therefore there would be fewer of them on the streets. Susan Buckley Horncastle, Lincolnshire \u2022 Saddened and horrified by the never-ending news of senseless stabbings and murders throughout the UK, I cannot help wondering how the fifth wealthiest nation in the world can afford to spend \u00a36.2bn on two aircraft carriers to police the world, but cannot afford to keep its own citizens safe. Our depleted police force has to be restored to whatever it takes to combat this evil situation. Bryan Hanson Blackburn, Lancashire \u2022 Bernard Hogan-Howe (who I trust) says the increase in stabbings is at least in part due to austerity. Theresa May (who I don\u2019t trust) says it isn\u2019t. Austerity continues to hurt public services, the education of future generations and the NHS, but is not working as the national debt continues to grow.

      "bodyText": "The European Union risks a populist-nationalist \u201cnightmare\u201d by the middle of the next decade unless centrists can win greater public backing for the European cause, the liberal leader Guy Verhofstadt has said. Elections this May could herald a big shake-up of the European parliament. The duopoly of centre-right and centre-left is expected to lose its majority for the first time in 40 years of direct elections although Emmanuel Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique En Marche (La REM) is expected to win seats for the first time, boosting liberal forces. Verhofstadt, the leader of the European parliament\u2019s Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) since 2009, said pro-European centrists had \u201ca last chance\u201d after the vote to wrest back ground from nationalists and populists before the next electoral contest in 2024. In an interview with the Guardian and five continental papers, the former Belgian prime minister said the EU needed an overhaul \u2013 managing the eurozone, migration and common defence \u2013 if it was to gain greater public support. \u201cNothing is eternal. Nothing. Not all political institutions are eternal. To reform is a duty that we have \u2026 and if if we fail, then the tragedy, the nightmare will become reality,\u201d he said. Verhofstadt endorsed the \u201cEuropean renaissance\u201d promoted by Macron in a pan-European column this week. He said the expected arrival of La REM MEPs would create a bloc broader than the current ALDE but he had no ambition to lead it. \u201cA new centrist, pro-European reformist political force\u201d was needed as an alternative to nationalists but also the status quo, Verhofstadt said. He ruled out a future alliance with Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement, because of the power-sharing agreement with the far-right League party led by Matteo Salvini. Verhofstadt faced a backlash from his group two years ago when he sought to bring the Five Star Movement into ALDE, out of Nigel Farage\u2019s Eurosceptic alliance. Rejecting suggestions of a mistake, Verhofstadt said it was \u201cnow no longer possible\u201d for Five Star to join the liberals, which he said was a pity because of the pro-European MEPs in its ranks. A scathing critic of anti-EU populist leaders, whom he described as \u201cenemies\u201d, Verhofstadt claimed Salvini wanted migrants to come to Europe because it allowed the Italian leader to play on people\u2019s fears. \u201cSalvini, he hopes that more are coming because he will get more votes, because the fear will be bigger.\u201d Verhofstadt has also crossed rhetorical swords with Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, over migration and the rule of law. The MEP accused his political rivals in the centre-right European People\u2019s party (EPP) of \u201clacking political courage\u201d in dealing with Orb\u00e1n after the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, was targeted in an anti-EU poster official campaign with antisemitic overtones. There have been \u201cawful posters in Budapest for months and months\u201d, Verhofstadt said, referring to campaigns against him as well as the Hungarian-born philanthropist George Soros and the Dutch MEP Judith Sargentini, who launched the rule-of-law sanctions process against Hungary. The leader of the EPP, Manfred Weber, gave an ultimatum to Orb\u00e1n on Tuesday to stop attacks on the EU, apologise to the EPP and allow Soros\u2019s Central European University to continuing issuing US degrees from Budapest in order to avoid his party\u2019s expulsion from the group. Verhofstadt has been accused by political rivals of delaying debate into the affairs of his own \u201cproblem\u201d leader, the billionaire Czech prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, a member of the ALDE group who stands accused of a conflict of interest over EU funds. Verhofstadt said Babi\u0161 would be obliged to \u201crepair\u201d a conflict of interest identified by European commission lawyers before the European elections. \u201cWe [the ALDE] will scrutinise it in the coming weeks and coming months before the elections so we are sure that Mr Babi\u0161 is responding.\u201d Verhofstadt is best known in the UK as the European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, but he does not want to prolong his work. Extending Brexit talks for a long time without a clear outcome from the British parliament in next week\u2019s vote would be \u201cthe worst thing\u201d for the EU, he said, claiming that Brexit was sapping the EU\u2019s ability to agree on contested subjects such as eurozone reform and migration. \u201cIt is not only a question of time; mentally we are busy with Brexit. In the coming years we have to avoid that we are again busy with Brexit.\u201d",

In 2015, he tweeted: \u201cIslam like alcoholism [sic]. The first step to recovery is admit you have a problem.\u201d Later in the same year, he tweeted: \u201cTurkey buys oil from ISIS. Muslims sticking together.\u201d </p> <p>Subsequently he said: \u201cI deeply regret my remarks on social media. At no point did I intend to cause any offence to the Muslim community. I have reflected on my comments and decided that I should step down as a local election candidate and resign (from) the Conservative party with immediate effect.\u201d <br></p> <p>A Conservative spokesman said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr Lamb was investigated and suspended by his local association back in 2017. He has subsequently resigned from the party. </p> <p>Discrimination or abuse of any kind is wrong and will not be tolerated. </p> <p>When CCHQ have been made aware of cases we have acted swiftly and decisively, suspending or expelling those involved and launching an immediate investigation under our party\u2019s code of conduct.</p> </blockquote> <p>But in an interview with the World at One Warsi, a member of the House of Lords and a former minister, insisted that the Tories were not doing enough to address the problem of Islamophobia in the party. She said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have a deep-rooted problem of anti-Muslim comments, Islamophobic comments, racist comments that have been made right from the top - from MPs through to councillors, council candidates, members, linked groups.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the past she suggested an internal inquiry could address the problem.

That means, yes, of course, making sure that the police have the powers and resources that they need, but at the same time making sure that we are taking action elsewhere.</p> <p>That could be early intervention. It means tacking gang culture, to stop gangs grooming young people ... It means addressing the challenges posed by drugs and county lines. It also means taking a mental health approach.</p> </blockquote> <p>The spokesman also said it was \u201ca matter of fact that both spending on police, and the number of police officers, are currently increasing.\u201d The government was investing up to \u00a3970m more in policing next year, he said.</p> <p>The spokesman also claimed that there was no contradiction between what he was saying and what May said yesterday. Although he did not repeat her \u201cno direct correlation\u201d argument about the link between violent crime and police numbers, he pointed out that in her full answer on this topic yesterday she said that this was a complex matter, with a range of factors being relevant.</p> <p>For the record, here is the fullest version I can find of what May said on this yesterday. She said: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you look at the figures, what you see is that there\u2019s no direct correlation between certain crimes and police numbers. What matters is how we ensure that police are responding to these criminal acts when they take place, that people are brought to justice. </p> <p>But what also matters is, as a government, that we look at the issues which underpin, that underlie, this use of knives and that we act on those. That\u2019s a cross-government approach, it\u2019s not just about the police, it\u2019s about the whole of government and it\u2019s the whole of government that\u2019s responding.</p> </blockquote> <p>At the briefing the spokesman said knife crime was the main item discussed at cabinet today. He said that May told her colleagues she would be asking \u201cthe Home Office to urgently coordinate a series of cabinet-level ministerial meetings and engagements to accelerate the work the government is doing in support of local authorities, the police and others.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-05T13:32:10.436Z\">at 1.32pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c7e7180e4b0f96cae7da94d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-05T12:57:48.489Z\">12.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bercow allows emergency debate today on Grayling's Seaborne Freight contrac</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>John Bercow,</strong> the speaker, has just agree to a request from the SNP MP Alan Brown to allow an emergency debate on the Department of Transport\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/09/government-cancels-brexit-ferry-contract-with-no-ship-firm\"> Seaborne Freight contract </a>(the no-deal contract for a ferry service with the firm that did not own any ferries).

That\u2019s the crucial point. How we get there ... is something we are prepared to be flexible about. The crucial thing is that we need to know that, as a sovereign parliament, we can\u2019t be trapped in the customs union.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the EU also wants a deal that will get through parliament and that the signs that this could be on offer were \u201creasonably positive\u201d.</strong> He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think the signals we are getting [in talks with the EU] are reasonably positive.

And I also think that they want to solve this problem. Brexit is a shadow hanging over the European Union. They have lots of challenges they want to get on and deal with. They want to move on as well.

We had a very robust referendum campaign, in which claims were made, and indeed exaggerated claims were made on both sides of the debate. That is what happens, not just in referendums but in general elections.

If MPs reject it, she has promised to hold a vote on Wednesday 13 March giving MPs the chance to say whether or not they want to leave the EU without a deal. And if a no-deal Brext gets rejected on the Wednesday, she will give MPs a vote on Thursday 14 March on extending article 50.</p> <p>But May has not said how she will whip her MPs to vote in the possible votes on Wednesday and on Thursday. There is an obvious dilemma. If she whips government MPs to vote against no deal, some Brexiters will rebel, and she could face resignations from government. The same issue would arise in reverse the following day, with pro-Europeans likely to resign from government if they are ordered to vote against an article 50 extension. But the crucial decision will have to be taken before the Wednesday vote.</p> <p>One obvious option would be for May to give MPs a free vote. And, in an interview on the Today programme, <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong>, the foreign secretary, admitted this was a possibility. Previously ministers have refused to discuss whipping arrangements next week. But, asked if MPs should be given a free vote on whether or not there should be a no-deal Brexit, Hunt replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, I think that is something that the government has to make a decision on, the prime minister has to make a decision on, and it is not for me to say that now. I don\u2019t think a decision has been taken. But what we are focused on as a government is making sure that we do not actually have to take that decision as a parliament in the first place. </p> </blockquote> <p>Earlier in the interview he gave another hint that a free vote was on the cards. Asked if the government would go for no deal, in the event of its deal being rejected, or if it would go for an article 50 extension, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, that depends on what parliament decides to do. </p> </blockquote> <p>I will post more from the interview soon.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>9.30am: </em>Theresa May chairs cabinet.</p> <p><em>11.30am: </em>Philip Hammond, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p><em>12pm:</em> Downing Street lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>2pm:</em> Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, gives a speech on disability benefits.

      "bodyText": "Downing Street has accepted that police numbers are a factor in the fight against violent crime. (See 1.23pm.) The issue dominated the discussion at cabinet, and Number 10 has chosen to refine its message after Theresa May provoked fury yesterday by claiming there was \u201cno direct correlation\u201d between police numbers and the incidence of violent crime. According to the Daily Mail\u2019s Jack Doyle, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, told the meeting that current police funding was inadequate. BMW has said it might be forced to stop making the Mini at its Cowley plant near Oxford in the event of a no-deal Brexit, putting more than 4,500 jobs and more than 100 years of carmaking at the site at risk. The UK economy came close to flatlining last month as Brexit uncertainty intensified and the global economy weakened, with employment levels falling at the fastest pace in almost nine years. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has admitted that Tory MPs may get a free vote on extending article 50 next week. (See 9.07am.) Donald Tusk has claimed external powers meddled in the Brexit vote as he called for EU member states to do more to protect the upcoming European elections. Chris Grayling has insisted the government thought it was worth taking a \u201crisk\u201d over Brexit ferry contracts after brushing aside calls to resign as transport secretary. As the Press Association reports, Grayling faced shouts of \u201cahoy there\u201d and \u201cpeekaboo\u201d from opposition MPs as he arrived in the Commons, a day after failing to appear to answer an urgent question on the controversial \u00a333m payout to Eurotunnel. The payment was to settle a legal action brought by Eurotunnel after the government awarded contracts to three ferry companies - one of which had no ships - to transport essential medical supplies from the EU if Britain leaves without a deal in place. Grayling said decisions on the matter were taken \u201ccollectively\u201d by ministers, although he said they were \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d it had not worked out as intended. The Labour MP Jess Phillips has challenged Theresa May and Damian Hinds, the education secretary, to explain why her son\u2019s school is going to close early on Fridays because it is short of money. She has suggested that parents affected by similar cuts organise a protest in London. The Conservative party has suspended 14 members for allegedly making Islamophobic comments after a string of abusive posts were uncovered on social media. Senior staff in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office advised against suspending a Labourmember who had defended an antisemitic mural, leaked emails reveal. The Labour party is to bring in independent specialists to deal with sexual harassment complaints, after criticism of its procedures. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has urged Theresa May to formally rule out a no deal Brexit as the Welsh and Scottish parliaments held their first simultaneous debates and vote on the same motion. Holyrood is due to vote at 6pm on the motion calling for a no deal option to be abandoned and for article 50 to be extended, with the Welsh assembly vote soon afterwards. It is the first time since devolution 20 years ago the two legislatures have joined forces in this way, with the Tories expected to vote against the motion in both places. In his opening statement in Cardiff, Drakeford said: In taking this historical step, we and our friends in Scotland hope to send a clear and united message to the UK government that action must be taken now to rule out a no-deal outcome at any time. By failing to do so the UK government is acting recklessly. The implications of a no deal are happening now, with investors like Honda and Nissan pulling out of the UK or cancelling investment plans. The impacts will get worse every day the uncertainty is allowed to continue. We are just 24 days away from crashing out of the EU. The prime minister can and must take action to remove this risk. I hope today\u2019s joint debate and votes will place further pressure on the prime minister to do the right thing. Britons living in Cyprus will have their rights protected even in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Cypriot foreign minister, Nikos Christodoulides has told Jeremy Hunt, his UK counterpart. Robert Goodwill, a former children\u2019s minister who left government in the reshuffle a year ago, has been appointed to replace George Eustice as an environment minister following Eustice\u2019s resignation on Friday, Downing Street has announced. These are from John Campbell, the BBC\u2019s Northern Ireland economics and business editor. This is from the Express\u2019s Joe Barnes. The phrase \u201cthere\u2019s always hope\u201d normally signals the opposite; that, actually, hope has all but vanished, and that disaster is imminent. I presume that wasn\u2019t the message that Cox was trying to convey on this occasion, and that he was just engaging with the question, but without being there it is hard to know ... This is from Sky\u2019s Ed Brown. Andy Bell from 5 News sums up today\u2019s politics - well, the non-Brexit stuff - in one picture. Katya Adler, the BBC\u2019s Europe editor, has posted a Twitter thread about this week\u2019s UK-EU Brexit talks. It starts here. She makes the main point in the final tweet. In the Commons a few minutes ago John Bercow, the speaker, told MPs that he has now received formal notification that Fiona Onasanya has been refused leave to appeal against her conviction for perverting the course of justice, and that as a result she will be subject to the recall procedure allowed under the Recall of MPs Act. This means that if 10% of her constituents sign a petition, there will be a byelection. Bercow said it would be for the petitions officer to announce details of when the petition will open. Here is a column from my colleague Gaby Hinsliff on Theresa May\u2019s claim yesterday that there is no \u201cdirect correlation\u201d between police numbers and violent crime. And this is how it starts. Their faces are hauntingly impossible to ignore, staring out from the front pages. Some are in school uniform, little more than children; others all teenage bravado, hovering on the difficult cusp of adulthood. But all 27 teenagers were far too young to die like this, stabbed to death on the streets of Britain in the past 12 months. This is the kind of national moment that demands a swift, reassuring and comprehensive response from politicians. And yet what it gets is Theresa May, stiffly insisting that there is \u201cno direct correlation\u201d between the rising tide of knife crime and police numbers. Nothing has changed, or if it has then it definitely wasn\u2019t her fault. It is a characteristically tone-deaf response to a public mood characterised by alarm and sorrow; why can\u2019t she see that dead children requires something more emotionally literate than this? But the bigger problem is that what she\u2019s saying flies in the face of common sense. According to BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham, the Conservative party has today suspended 14 members over Islamophobic comments posted on a pro-Tory Facebook page. Rob Ford, an academic who co-wrote the definitive book on the rise of Ukip, has posted a good thread on Twitter explaining why the problem of racism in the party is one that is likely to get worse under Theresa May. It starts here. And here are two of his posts. During points of order in the Commons earlier Sarah Wollaston, the chair of the Commons health committee, claimed that Labour wanted to remove Luciana Berger from the committee. Wollaston, a former Conservative, and Berger, a former Labour MP, are both now members of the Independent Group, and Wollaston said that, since Berger was originally appointed to the committee in her capacity as a Labour MP, the party now wanted to replace her. She said that this move would be \u201cdeeply unhelpful\u201d, particularly because Berger was on maternity leave. John Bercow, the speaker, said there was precedent for an MP who was appointed to a select committee to represent one party being removed after defecting to another. But he said the Commons as a whole would have to vote for a motion approving this, and that he was not aware of any plans for a vote on replacing Berger. Theresa May will be holding her own Brexit talks later today when she meets the Cypriot president, Nicos Anastasiades, in Downing Street. As the leader of a former British colony - that is now home to at least 70,000 UK residents - the Cypriot president and his government are concerned about the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU in ways that other member states aren\u2019t. Britain\u2019s status as a guarantor power of the war-divided Mediterranean island, and the role it will play in the country\u2019s eventual reunification, is expected to top the agenda when Anastasiades meets May later this afternoon. In separate talks with Jeremy Hunt earlier today, Cyprus\u2019 foreign minister Nikos Christodoulides urged the UK government to publicly announce that ongoing Brexit negotiations would in no way impede the resumption of the stalled peace process to reunify the island\u2019s Greek and Turkish communities, as claimed by Ankara. The prospect of no deal has especially worried the Cypriot government both in terms of its potential impact on the number of Britons visiting the island, the plight of UK pensioners resident there, and the future of the two sovereign military bases retained by Britain following independence. Today\u2019s meetings follow last night\u2019s Cyprus celebrations at Buckingham Palace - a first-ever event also aimed at strengthening bilateral ties and allaying \u2018no deal\u2019 fears. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, told MPs earlier today, during Treasury questions, that if a Brexit deal is agreed, a \u201chuge amount of pent-up investment\u201d will flood into the economy. He said: My view is that we have a huge amount of pent-up investment that has not gone ahead over the last two-and-a-half years because of uncertainty. Once we can provide clarity to British business about our future and we do that by supporting the deal that the prime minister will be bringing forward next week, we will unleash that investment and we will allow Britain to achieve its rightful potential as one of the world\u2019s leading technology powers. Here is the Labour MP Margaret Hodge on the latest leaked email showing staff in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office were consulted about the handling of antisemitism complaints. The Conservative party also has its own problems with racism. Sayeeda Warsi, the former party chair, has called for an independent inquiry into \u201cinstitutional\u201d Islamophobia in the party. She said that the problem was \u201cdeep-rooted\u201d within her party and that it could damage Tory chances at the next election. As the Press Association reports, Warsi\u2019s intervention came after Tory council candidate Peter Lamb quit after coming under fire for social media comments about Islam. Lamb was due to stand in Harlow, Essex, in May\u2019s local elections despite having been disciplined in 2017. In 2015, he tweeted: \u201cIslam like alcoholism [sic]. The first step to recovery is admit you have a problem.\u201d Later in the same year, he tweeted: \u201cTurkey buys oil from ISIS. Muslims sticking together.\u201d Subsequently he said: \u201cI deeply regret my remarks on social media. At no point did I intend to cause any offence to the Muslim community. I have reflected on my comments and decided that I should step down as a local election candidate and resign (from) the Conservative party with immediate effect.\u201d A Conservative spokesman said: Mr Lamb was investigated and suspended by his local association back in 2017. He has subsequently resigned from the party. Discrimination or abuse of any kind is wrong and will not be tolerated. When CCHQ have been made aware of cases we have acted swiftly and decisively, suspending or expelling those involved and launching an immediate investigation under our party\u2019s code of conduct. But in an interview with the World at One Warsi, a member of the House of Lords and a former minister, insisted that the Tories were not doing enough to address the problem of Islamophobia in the party. She said: We have a deep-rooted problem of anti-Muslim comments, Islamophobic comments, racist comments that have been made right from the top - from MPs through to councillors, council candidates, members, linked groups. In the past she suggested an internal inquiry could address the problem. But now she thought an independent inquiry was needed, she said. We cannot have a situation where a mainstream political party is sending out a message in the way it is acting that certain parts of our country, certain communities in our country, certain citizens in our country, are simply not welcome in our party and therefore are creating this environment in which, sadly, I think we will feel the impact at the next election. Warsi urged Tory chief executive and treasurer Sir Mick Davis to act, claiming Thereas May and party chairman Brandon Lewis had \u201cfailed\u201d to address the problem. Q: What do you think of Theresa May\u2019s comment about there being no direct correlation between police numbers and the incidence of violent crime, given your previous role as home secretary? Rudd says these crimes are heartbreaking. There are many different elements explaining the increase, she says. She says there have been a lot of new government interventions. She hopes they will make a difference. Rudd refuses to explicitly back May\u2019s claim (see 11.07am) that there is \u201cno direct correlation\u201d between police numbers and the incidence of violent crime. Rudd\u2019s answer is not hugely surprising because Downing Street itself appears to have dropped the phrase that May used yesterday. (See 1.23pm.) Q: Is it fair to carry on the contract with the firm that does the work capability assessments? Rudd says there are different views about how best to improve the work capability assessments. She is determined to ensure that they are improved. She says she hopes the contract for this work will be more competitive in the future. Q: Do you regret that the benefit freeze had to carry on this year? Rudd says there are no plans to extend the benefit freeze. Q: Do you think your party needs to apologise for describing benefit claimants as scroungers? Rudd says she does not recognise that language. She does not accept that that is how the party treated people in the past. But she says she is not saying that everything was perfect in the past. Q: Could you stay in government if Tory MPs are whipped to vote for a no-deal Brexit next week? Rudd says she is hoping that the deal will be passed next week. That is what she wants, so that she and other ministers can get on with their departmental priorities. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, is now taking questions from journalists. Q: Some people feel they have been put on trial by the DWP? Has this damaged the Conservative party? Rudd says it would be a mistake to think the situation was perfect in the past. The benefits system can always be improved. That is what she is doing. Q: There are reports today you have been gagged by the Tories. Is this true? No, says Rudd. Otherwise she would not be here. As the Guardian reports, the Labour MP Margaret Hodge has claimed that Jeremy Corbyn misled her when he told her recently that his office did not intervene in the party\u2019s handling of complaints about antisemitism. The Times\u2019s Sam Coates has revealed fresh emails showing that staff in Corbyn\u2019s office were consulted about how some of these complaints should be handled. A Labour spokesperson said: Since becoming general secretary, Jennie Formby has made procedures for dealing with complaints about antisemitism more robust. Staff who work on disciplinary matters have always led on investigations and recommendations on individual cases. Any suggestion that staff in the leader\u2019s office overturned recommendations on individual cases is categorically untrue. Fiona Onasanya has lost an appeal against her conviction for perverting the course of justice, leaving open the possibility of a recall petition which could force the Peterborough MP from office, my colleague Rajeev Syal reports. BMW has said it might be forced to stop making the Mini at its Cowley plant near Oxford in the event of a no-deal Brexit, putting more than 100 years of carmaking at the site at risk, my colleagues Jasper Jolly and Rob Davies report. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, has just started her speech on disability benefits. There is a live feed here. Here is the Guardian story previewing the speech, in which Rudd will announce and overhaul of personal independence payments (Pip) for older people. And here is a written ministerial statement from Rudd with more details of the announcement. I won\u2019t be covering the speech minute by minute, but I will tune in for the Q&amp;A. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, posted this on his Twitter feed earlier, ahead of his trip to Brussels. He is going there with Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general. They will be meeting Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, and his team between 4.30pm and 6pm UK time, and then having dinner with them. This tweet suggests Barclay thinks a deal is still possible but, according to Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam, he has also written to Barnier asking if the UK and the EU can agree to implement the citizens\u2019 rights section of the withdrawal agreement, even if the overall agreement fails to pass the Commons. This request is one mandated by the Commons, when it passed the Alberto Costa amendment without opposition last week. At the time Barclay said that he would formally ask the EU to agree a stand-alone citizens\u2019 rights deal, in the event of there being no overall deal. But the EU has already said it will not accept this proposal. Yesterday Theresa May said that there was \u201cno direct link\u201d between between police numbers and the incidence of violent crimes. (See 11.07am.) Her comment caused quite a stir, as the Guardian splash this morning reflected. Today Downing Street has refined its message. At the lunchtime lobby briefing, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman conceded that police resources were relevant in the fight against violent crime. Asked if the prime minister agreed with Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan police commissioner who this morning said that \u201cof course\u201d there was a link between violent crime and police numbers (see 11.07am), the spokesman said: The point that the PM was making yesterday is that this a complex area, and that we need to be addressing the issues in all areas. That means, yes, of course, making sure that the police have the powers and resources that they need, but at the same time making sure that we are taking action elsewhere. That could be early intervention. It means tacking gang culture, to stop gangs grooming young people ... It means addressing the challenges posed by drugs and county lines. It also means taking a mental health approach. The spokesman also said it was \u201ca matter of fact that both spending on police, and the number of police officers, are currently increasing.\u201d The government was investing up to \u00a3970m more in policing next year, he said. The spokesman also claimed that there was no contradiction between what he was saying and what May said yesterday. Although he did not repeat her \u201cno direct correlation\u201d argument about the link between violent crime and police numbers, he pointed out that in her full answer on this topic yesterday she said that this was a complex matter, with a range of factors being relevant. For the record, here is the fullest version I can find of what May said on this yesterday. She said: If you look at the figures, what you see is that there\u2019s no direct correlation between certain crimes and police numbers. What matters is how we ensure that police are responding to these criminal acts when they take place, that people are brought to justice. But what also matters is, as a government, that we look at the issues which underpin, that underlie, this use of knives and that we act on those. That\u2019s a cross-government approach, it\u2019s not just about the police, it\u2019s about the whole of government and it\u2019s the whole of government that\u2019s responding. At the briefing the spokesman said knife crime was the main item discussed at cabinet today. He said that May told her colleagues she would be asking \u201cthe Home Office to urgently coordinate a series of cabinet-level ministerial meetings and engagements to accelerate the work the government is doing in support of local authorities, the police and others.\u201d John Bercow, the speaker, has just agree to a request from the SNP MP Alan Brown to allow an emergency debate on the Department of Transport\u2019s Seaborne Freight contract (the no-deal contract for a ferry service with the firm that did not own any ferries). The debate will start shortly. Bercow says he understands that Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, will speak in it. This is from my colleague Daniel Boffey. I am off to the Downing Street lobby briefing now. I will post again after 12.30pm. And here is the full quote from Chris Grayling where he defended his recorded as justice secretary after the National Audit Office found that his decision to part-privatise the probation service cost at least \u00a3171m. (See 11.19am.) Grayling said: Yes, the probation reforms haven\u2019t worked as well as would have wanted, but the reality is that we now supervise 40,000 more people a year than was the case before. We now have fewer people reoffending than was the case before. When I took over as secretary of state for justice, if you went to prison for less than 12 months, you literally walked out the prison on the streets with no support, nothing. That doesn\u2019t happen anymore. The BBC\u2019s Danny Shaw has some useful background on the debate about the link between police numbers and the incidence of violent crime. (See 11.07am.) On the subject of Chris Grayling, ConservativeHome has published its regular monthly survey showing how Conservative party members rank members of the cabinet - and the transport secretary comes last, by a clear margin. Surprisingly, Andrea Leadsom comes top. The average household in England faces a \u00a375.60 hike in council tax from April, according to a survey of local authorities. As the Press Association reports, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa) study found a planned average increase of 4.5% for Band D households in 2019/20. The increase is lower than the 5.1% or \u00a380.92 hike last year, but is still the second highest council tax rise in the last decade, Cipfa said. And this is what Chris Grayling said about the Eurotunnel settlement as he arrived at Number 10 for cabinet. (See 10.32am.) He said the Department of Health took the decision to settle the case by offering the firm a contract worth \u00a333m. The decision that we took last week was taken by the Department of Health to protect drugs supplies to the UK in a no-deal in the same way as these contracts were let in the first place, after a discussion and a decision by a cabinet committee, because we had to prepare for all eventualities. We are still working for a deal, we don\u2019t want to leave without a deal, but we have to be ready for all eventualities. This was a sensible part of contingency planning to make sure that we had all resources that we needed, all the medical supplies that we needed for the NHS. That is why the cabinet took the decision that it did. That is why we collectively last week decided, however regrettable the Eurotunnel court action was, that we had to take a decision to protect the interests of the country in the circumstances of a no-deal Brexit. And that is the right thing to do. Asked if he felt under pressure to resign, he said: I will carry on serving the prime minister as long as she wants me to. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, has also responded to the recent National Audit Office report criticising reforms to probation services introduced by Grayling when he was justice secretary, the BBC\u2019s Danny Shaw reports. The Bank of England has criticised the EU - saying the City is ready for a no-deal Brexit, but Europe isn\u2019t, my colleague Graeme Wearden reports. There is more on his business live blog here. Yesterday Theresa May said there was no \u201cdirect correlation\u201d between police numbers and the incidence of knife crime. She said: If you look at the figures, what you see is that there\u2019s no direct correlation between certain crimes and police numbers. What matters is how we ensure that police are responding to these criminal acts when they take place, that people are brought to justice. In an LBC phone-in this morning Cressida Dick, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, said she disagreed. She explained: If you went back in history, you would see examples of when police officer numbers have gone down and crime has not necessarily risen at the same rate and in the same way. But I think that what we all agree on is that in the last few years police officer numbers have gone down a lot, there\u2019s been a lot of other cuts in public services, there has been more demand for policing and therefore there must be something, and I have consistently said that. I agree that there is some link between violent crime on the streets, obviously, and police numbers. Of course there is, and everybody would see that. Output in Britain\u2019s dominant services sector increased marginally in February, but hiring declined at its fastest pace in seven years as Brexit concerns continue to weigh on the economy, the Press Association reports. The closely watched IHS Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) showed a reading of 51.3 last month, up from the two-and-a-half-year low of 50.1 recorded in January. A reading above 50 indicates growth. The reading beat economists\u2019 expectations of 49.8 but recent data suggests the economy is close to stagnation and on track for its weakest quarter since the final three months of 2012. The data indicates that the economy will grow by just 0.1% in the first quarter of 2019. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, told reporters that he would not be resigning as he arrived at Number 10 for cabinet, Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti reports. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter and chair of the European Research Group, has taken issue with yesterday\u2019s Evening Standard cartoon. Labour backbencher Margaret Hodge has accused Jeremy Corbyn of misleading her about tackling antisemitism, or being misled himself, in a further escalation of party infighting on an issue that continues to dog the Labour leader, my colleague Matthew Weaver reports. The Scottish and Welsh parliaments are expected to pass simultaneous motions later today condemning Theresa May\u2019s stance on Brexit, and urging her to extend the article 50 deadline to allow more time to resolve the crisis. It is the first time the two legislatures have debated and voted on identical motions since their foundation 20 years ago, although the two governments, one Scottish National party-led and the other Labour-led, do not have matching positions on the EU. For instance, the joint motion stops short of endorsing a second EU referendum even though that is SNP policy. It is a position which would command a majority at Holyrood, but it appears a second referendum vote was dropped to win Labour backing. The Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, suggested last week he preferred a Brexit on Labour\u2019s terms to a new referendum. The Holyrood motion reads: Parliament reiterates its opposition to the damaging EU exit deal agreed by the UK government; agrees that a no deal outcome to the current negotiations on EU withdrawal would be completely unacceptable on 29 March 2019 or at any time; calls on the UK government to take immediate steps to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a deal, and agrees that the article 50 process should be extended so that agreement can be reached on the best way forward to protect the interests of Scotland, Wales and the UK as a whole. The Tories are resisting the motions in both Edinburgh and Cardiff, putting down an amendment at Holyrood which says: [Parliament] respects the results of constitutional referendums; supports leaving the EU with a deal; notes that a no deal outcome will happen by the automatic operation of the law unless an agreement is reached; further notes that this would still be the case after an extension to article 50, and believes that the Scottish government is no longer acting in good faith for the people of Scotland. The Tories are not expected to triumph, in these legislatures at least. There were some other good lines in the Today programme interview with Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary. Here is a full summary. Hunt conceded that Tory MPs could be given a free vote next week on whether or not to approve a no-deal Brexit. (See 9.07am.) He did not deny reports that the government is now longer insisting that the UK is demanding either a time-limit to the backstop, or a unilateral exit mechanism, in its latest negotiation with the EU. Asked about these reports, Hunt said: We are saying to the EU the crucial thing is that, as a sovereign parliament, it must not be possible to trap in the European Union\u2019s customs union indefinitely. That\u2019s the crucial point. How we get there ... is something we are prepared to be flexible about. The crucial thing is that we need to know that, as a sovereign parliament, we can\u2019t be trapped in the customs union. He said the EU also wants a deal that will get through parliament and that the signs that this could be on offer were \u201creasonably positive\u201d. He explained: I think the signals we are getting [in talks with the EU] are reasonably positive. I don\u2019t want to overstate them because I still think there\u2019s a lot of work to do, but I think they do understand that we are being sincere. I think that they are beginning to realise that we can get a majority in parliament because they are seeing the signals coming from the people who voted against the deal before who are saying, crucially, that they are prepared to be reasonable about how we get to that position that we can\u2019t legally be trapped in the backstop ... The week before last, I met 10 European foreign ministers ... And I also think that they want to solve this problem. Brexit is a shadow hanging over the European Union. They have lots of challenges they want to get on and deal with. They want to move on as well. So, I think with goodwill on all sides, it is possible to find a way through. He suggested that a no-deal Brexit would not be an acceptable outcome for the government. He said: If this deal does not go through, then the only solution is to find a deal that will go through. That is the only way we are going to solve this issue. He rejected the claim from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that the British public were deceived during the EU referendum. When this was put to him, Hunt replied: Well, I don\u2019t agree with that approach. We had a very robust referendum campaign, in which claims were made, and indeed exaggerated claims were made on both sides of the debate. That is what happens, not just in referendums but in general elections. British people are quite smart enough to be able to listen to the claims made by politicians in these situations and make their own judgment. And they made a decision. The Conservative MP Nick Boles, who is strongly opposed to the idea of the UK leaving the EU without a deal, has welcomed the news that the government may allow a free vote on this next week. (See 9.07am.) Theresa May has given a commitment to hold another vote on her Brexit deal - another \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d, in the jargon - by 12 March, a week today. If MPs reject it, she has promised to hold a vote on Wednesday 13 March giving MPs the chance to say whether or not they want to leave the EU without a deal. And if a no-deal Brext gets rejected on the Wednesday, she will give MPs a vote on Thursday 14 March on extending article 50. But May has not said how she will whip her MPs to vote in the possible votes on Wednesday and on Thursday. There is an obvious dilemma. If she whips government MPs to vote against no deal, some Brexiters will rebel, and she could face resignations from government. The same issue would arise in reverse the following day, with pro-Europeans likely to resign from government if they are ordered to vote against an article 50 extension. But the crucial decision will have to be taken before the Wednesday vote. One obvious option would be for May to give MPs a free vote. And, in an interview on the Today programme, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, admitted this was a possibility. Previously ministers have refused to discuss whipping arrangements next week. But, asked if MPs should be given a free vote on whether or not there should be a no-deal Brexit, Hunt replied: Well, I think that is something that the government has to make a decision on, the prime minister has to make a decision on, and it is not for me to say that now. I don\u2019t think a decision has been taken. But what we are focused on as a government is making sure that we do not actually have to take that decision as a parliament in the first place. Earlier in the interview he gave another hint that a free vote was on the cards. Asked if the government would go for no deal, in the event of its deal being rejected, or if it would go for an article 50 extension, he replied: Well, that depends on what parliament decides to do. I will post more from the interview soon. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. 11.30am: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons. 12pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. 2pm: Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, gives a speech on disability benefits. As Rowena Mason reports, she will say that hundreds of thousands of pensioners will no longer have to undergo reviews to carry on getting their disability benefits. 3.35pm: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, gives evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee. Also today Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, and Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, are visiting Brussels for another round of talks about new assurances on the backstop that could help the government get the Brexit deal through the Commons. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary when I finish late afternoon. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. UDPATE: Here is Jeremy Hunt arriving for cabinet today.",

Macron is right to warn that this is a pivotal moment. The corrosive, continent-wide onslaught of rightwing populist, nationalist and xenophobic forces is real and urgent. It found its most recent expression in Estonia at the weekend, where <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20190304-estonia-opposition-reform-party-kaja-kallas-wins-election-far-right-surges\" title=\"\">electoral support for the far right surged</a>.</p> <p>Yet the debate kickstarted by Macron is one from which the English, Scots, Welsh and Northern Irish, apparently against the wishes of most, will imminently be excluded.

      "bodyText": "Emmanuel Macron\u2019s open letter to Europe\u2019s citizens, published in all 28 EU member states, is an ambitious attempt to stop the rot inside the EU and create a framework for progressive, democratic renewal. But in taking his best shot at saving Europe, France\u2019s president has badly misfired, or \u2013 to use a duelling term adapted from the French \u2013 deloped. Europe\u2019s future cohesion and coherence are of primary importance to Britain, in or out. Macron is right to warn that this is a pivotal moment. The corrosive, continent-wide onslaught of rightwing populist, nationalist and xenophobic forces is real and urgent. It found its most recent expression in Estonia at the weekend, where electoral support for the far right surged. Yet the debate kickstarted by Macron is one from which the English, Scots, Welsh and Northern Irish, apparently against the wishes of most, will imminently be excluded. That is a tragedy for Britain, but also for Europe. EU blueprints of any kind generally benefit from British input, if only in moderating wilder, more impractical ideas. This is the case now. Macron\u2019s idealistic, statist scattergun approach is most evident in his proposal for a new \u201cEuropean Agency for the Protection of Democracies\u201d whose task, he says, would be to provide member states with expert advice on how to defend elections from outside manipulation. It would also regulate party funding and police the internet. This sort of invasive attempt to impose supranational controls, overseen by Brussels, on something as democratically fundamental as a national election is why so many people, not just in Britain, have come to resent and distrust the EU. In floating such a top-down idea, Macron betrays a lack of feel for the popular will \u2013 and the spirit of the times. Remainers in Britain who back a second referendum, and would support post-Brexit efforts to rejoin the EU, should consider the implications of this and other aspects of Macron\u2019s \u201cEuropean renaissance\u201d. He seems to mean well. But does he really think Poles, or Greeks, or even the Russian-bullied Baltic republics would trust the EU to be ultimate arbiter of the fairness of their constitutional processes? Macron does not duck the EU\u2019s most divisive internal problem \u2013 migration \u2013 but neither is he entirely candid. He concedes that this issue, more than any other, fuels anti-EU sentiment in Italy, Hungary and elsewhere. He calls for more stringent border controls and a common asylum policy. All this would be supervised by another new EU-wide body, a sinister-sounding \u201cEuropean Council for Internal Security\u201d. Yet recent polling suggests that while majorities in most European countries support asylum for people fleeing violence and war, voters are uniformly critical of the EU\u2019s handling of the refugee issue. If and when the next Syria-scale crisis breaks, it is clear most Europeans would prefer that national governments, not a supranational EU body, set policy and take charge \u2013 which, in effect, is what Angela Merkel did in Germany in 2015. Questions of trustworthiness and competence shed doubt on another key Macron proposal: a mutual defence treaty, increased EU-wide defence spending, and a \u201cEuropean security council\u201d. Although he talks of a continuing association with Nato, this plan looks like a reincarnation of long-simmering, essentially anti-American, quasi-Gaullist ideas about an independent Europe freed from US \u201chegemony\u201d. There is much to recommend a more autonomous capability, given the transatlantic uncertainties of the Trump era. But in truth, EU countries remain only too content to shelter behind the post-1945 US defensive shield, continue to limit or cut defence budgets, and have done little in practice to realise French hopes of a European army. The recent, cautious Franco-German treaty of Aachen provided another reality check in this regard. Europe needs Britain if it is to sustain a credible defence, security and intelligence-gathering posture. Macron knows this full well, which is why \u2013 in this respect alone \u2013 he signalled willingness to keep Britain \u201conboard\u201d. This raises the question of why he otherwise appears so keen to exclude Britain. The UK, he wrote smugly, would eventually find its \u201ctrue place\u201d in relation to Europe \u2013 evidently without much help from him. For Macron, Brexit Britain is most useful as a dire warning of what happens if you challenge his grandiose idea of Europe. The demons are unleashed, the \u201canger-mongers\u201d take charge, and things fall apart. He is right, up to a point.

Even if she gets the ERG and the Democratic Unionist party on board many believe she will need dozens of Labour voters to neuter hardline anti-dealers in her own party.</p> <p>Already, her key opponents, the ERG and the DUP, have indicated a softening of position in preparation for the critical votes on 12, 13 and 14 of March. Tony Blair (see below) smells machiavellian motives.</p> <p>But for now, the key development is that both have accepted that the assurances need not be in the agreement itself, a significant change in approach especially given the DUP demand the backstop had to be removed altogether from the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>But even if she can get the ERG and the DUP onboard, May is by no means out of the woods.

      "bodyText": "With just over three weeks to go before Brexit day, a smell of urgency is in the air. The UK\u2019s attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, and the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, are back in Brussels on Tuesday. Their mission is to return with a firm \u201clegal add-on\u201d to enable May to tell MPs next week that Cox has changed his legal advice on the Irish backstop and he no longer believes it will \u201ctrap\u201d the UK in a customs union with the EU indefinitely, as he averred in November. Before we get to the main developments of the last week, a reminder that producing the Guardian\u2019s independent, in-depth journalism takes time and money. We do it because we believe our perspective matters and it may be yours, too. If you value our Brexit coverage, please become a Guardian supporter. Thank you. If you would like to receive it as a weekly email, please sign up here. And you can catch our monthly Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here. Main developments This was the week that the remainers in the Tory party finally stood up to be counted after defector Anna Soubry said the party was being held to ransom by the European Research Group (ERG). After it emerged last Monday that 15-20 cabinet ministers threatened to resign if May didn\u2019t take no deal off the table, the prime minister emerged in the House of Commons with a pledge of three key votes for parliament \u2013 a vote on her deal; a vote on no deal and a vote on extending article 50. But her climbdown needs to be matched by more than 100 opponents if she is to get her deal over the line next week. Even if she gets the ERG and the Democratic Unionist party on board many believe she will need dozens of Labour voters to neuter hardline anti-dealers in her own party. Already, her key opponents, the ERG and the DUP, have indicated a softening of position in preparation for the critical votes on 12, 13 and 14 of March. Tony Blair (see below) smells machiavellian motives. But for now, the key development is that both have accepted that the assurances need not be in the agreement itself, a significant change in approach especially given the DUP demand the backstop had to be removed altogether from the withdrawal agreement. But even if she can get the ERG and the DUP onboard, May is by no means out of the woods. A key vote in the Commons last week designed to take no deal off the table exposed just how far away she still is from a deal. As many as 22 Tory MPs voted against a non-legally binding amendment put forward by Yvette Cooper designed to remove no deal as an option. They included Esther McVey and William Cash, MPs who will probably never vote for May\u2019s deal. But worryingly for May, a further 88 predominantly Eurosceptic Tory MPs abstained, including Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, and Jacob Rees-Mogg. There is also concern about the numbers of Labour MPs who might defy Corbyn and vote for May\u2019s deal after her bid to shore up support by announcing \u00a31.6bn boost for deprived towns was dismissed as a fairly hollow \u201cBrexit bribe\u201d. What else in the last week? There was a big win for EU citizens and a big lose for the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, in the high court. Campaigners for the future rights of EU citizens got a surprise turbo-boost after the Tory backbencher Alberto Costa won government backing for an amendment forcing Theresa May to seek an urgent meeting in Brussels to \u201cringfence\u201d their rights in the event of no deal. The support came after a chaotic few hours during which Costa was forced from his job in a junior government post and the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said there was \u201cnothing wrong\u201d with the amendment, less than 24 hours after May had dismissed it as unworkable. Costa has written to Donald Tusk and awaits his reply. And there was trouble for Grayling, who was being sued by Eurotunnel over his Brexit ferry contracts. On Friday, he saved himself the embarrassment of a four-day trial by coughing up \u00a333m in an out-of-court settlement. There was also some big news at the Labour party with a move towards a second referendum, something many believe does not have the support of Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cWhen the meaningful vote comes back \u2013 and we are told maybe that might be on 12 March \u2013 there are rumours today that it could be next week \u2026 That\u2019s the time when we will have to put the amendment up,\u201d said Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. What\u2019s next? All eyes on Brussels this week. Much focus this week will be the \u201creview mechanism\u201d in the Irish protocol in the agreement. According to Cox\u2019s legal advice last November, this clause \u201cadds little, other than procedurally, to the international law position to which the protocol is already subject\u201d. The EU and the UK have been working to flesh out three potential areas to provide the legally binding assurances The overall objective, say officials, is to allow Cox to change his legal advice, dating back to November last year, that the backstop could \u201ctrap\u201d the UK in a permanent customs union with the EU indefinitely. Michel Barnier has suggested that there could be a \u201cjoint interpretative statement\u201d or \u201clegal add on\u201d over the backstop. But there may also be a joint text on the \u201calternative arrangements\u201d and the future use of technology, as provided for in the political declaration paragraphs 140 and 141. In Downing Street, the calculation appears to be that May may need two or even three meaningful votes to get her deal over the line (or test it to destruction). May hopes to win round more hardline Eurosceptics to back her deal, playing on their fears that a delay to Brexit could mean a second referendum. If she fails, the Commons will then be asked to vote on no deal and a possible extension of article 50 that international trade secretary Liam Fox said this week would be \u201cacceptable\u201d. An extension to article 50 is not guaranteed, however, with a firm warning by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that France would block a Brexit delay unless there is a firm \u201cchoice\u201d by the UK on a new direction. Best of the rest Any extension of article 50 must be a one-off. Don\u2019t just use A50 extension to go around in circles, use it to decide future relationship, May told. Independent Group moves to push for second referendum. Labour will whip its MPs on second referendum vote. Eurotunnel will get its \u00a333m from Grayling deal or no deal. Concern over food safety standards after the US outline objectives for post-Brexit trade deal. Government no-deal paper reveals economy could shrink by up to 9%; Northern Ireland businesses could go bust and food prices rise. Beyond insane: Why a home-dialysis patient fears no-deal could kill her. Comment This week it\u2019s over to Daniel Hannan, widely considered one of the architects of Brexit, and Tony Blair, who both agree that the big issue is not the withdrawal from the EU but the lack of debate and decision on the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU \u2013 Norway, Canada or no deal? Here, Hannan makes a case for a 21 month extension to article 50. But is a terrible Brexit in 2019 really worse than a successful one in 2020? Isn\u2019t there at least an argument for replacing 21 months of non-voting membership, when we\u2019d have no veto and so be in the weakest possible position to negotiate a final settlement, with a new deal whereby we moved straight to the final settlement, with no need for a transition Tony Blair argues that an extension to article 50 has to be meaningful and force May to choose what she wants \u2013 Canada, Norway or no deal and then put it to the people.

      "body": "<p>The Brexit debate is coming to a head at a moment when Britain\u2019s political parties seem to be coming apart. Maybe that is not surprising. The 2016 referendum usurped the role of parliament and MPs. And both Labour and Conservative parties are being pulled by the far right and far left. The mess of Brexit is the result. Millions of voters are left feeling not only frustrated but homeless, with unprecedented strain on the stability and legitimacy of the two-party system.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/20/tory-mps-defect-independent-group-soubry-allen-wollaston\" title=\"\">defections from the main parties</a> last month were not just about Brexit. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/04/labour-antisemitism-party-left-bigotry\" title=\"\">Labour\u2019s antisemitism crisis</a> also reflects dangerous wider trends. It is horrifying to see the Jewish roots of MPs turned into a weapon against their political views; to see sectarianism so deep that reason is lost; to see the anonymity of social media toxify political debate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/03/brexit-citizensassembly-compromise\">A citizens\u2019 assembly can sort Brexit mess</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But while the question of Labour\u2019s future will take some time to resolve, the Brexit question is now down to hours. The prime minister is trapped in what can only be called frenetic paralysis, desperately trying to move forward but unable to do so because of the competing pressures on her. Meanwhile the country heads for the cliff edge.</p> <p>There is only one way to safeguard the political legitimacy, never mind the economic stability, of the country, and that is to re-engage the people. And here is the madness of the current situation: the arguments made against a second referendum apply, in spades, to the prime minister\u2019s deal. It is said that a referendum would be divisive, prolong the Brexit agony, and fuel the far right. But all of these arguments can be made about the prime minister\u2019s deal.</p> <p>It is true that a further referendum will require people to take sides. But we are divided already, because the 2016 referendum made a mockery of the principle of informed consent, and Theresa May\u2019s deal satisfies no one. Leavers say it is not what they voted for. Remainers say their opinion was not properly taken into account. And the choices, as the recent <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/13854\" title=\"\">Institute for Fiscal Studies report</a> made clear, are only going to get harder, as the reality of Brexit works its way through the economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcb55f626b2d6b435b4772f8b48cc45ed6fd5361\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcb55f626b2d6b435b4772f8b48cc45ed6fd5361/234_107_2219_1331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former foreign secretary David Miliband (left) and David Cameron in London 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I deplored David Cameron\u2019s argument that he had no option but to put a referendum in his 2015 manifesto.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The idea that the May deal will end the Brexit trauma is also misplaced. This deal is only the beginning of the negotiations, and in all likelihood the easiest part. The trade-offs associated with the choice of our Brexit future \u2013 between alignment with European regulation and the exercise of a new-found freedom to deviate \u2013 are only going to get harder.</p> <p>The argument that a second referendum would boost the far right has been presented in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/12/grayling-under-fire-for-claim-blocking-brexit-could-boost-far-right\" title=\"\">cynical terms by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling</a>, and in an honourable and serious way by various Labour figures. But the counter case is that the politics of anger represented by nativists and nationalists, on the mainstream right as well as the extreme right, is on the march anyway, and finds vent already. While a referendum would give a platform to Nigel Farage, it is not as if he lacks a platform without a referendum.</p> <p>Ploughing on, when we know that the painful choices that have been avoided by May and Jeremy Corbyn for more than two years will only multiply, is not a salve; it is itself a recipe for more division. May\u2019s bad deal is only an indicator of more pain to come.</p> <p>A further referendum is not just a way for voters to decide whether to incur the economic and social cost of a final Brexit deal. That would be a good reason \u2013 the metaphor of putting down an offer on a house but waiting for the surveyor\u2019s report before deciding whether to sign the contract makes the point. Leading Brexiteers, from Jacob Rees-Mogg to David Davis, previously argued for two referendums as \u201cbookends\u201d of the democratic process. There is nothing undemocratic about giving voters the final say.</p> <p>A referendum is also a way for the country to renew its democracy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/16/mps-brexit-citizens-assembly-lisa-nandy-stella-creasy\" title=\"\">Citizens\u2019 assemblies</a>, local debates, new mechanisms of popular engagement, new focus from broadcasters and social media companies on fact-checking and fake news, new protections against Russian interference \u2013 they will all face catcalls that they are high-minded or boring. But they have been shown in other contexts to overcome the danger that it is only those shouting loudest who get heard.</p> <p>There is a danger that the demagogues take over again in the course of another referendum campaign, but only if we neglect the lessons about how to engage voters in a serious way. The evidence from Ireland \u2013 where two referendums covering gay rights and abortion, both core to deeply held views of national identity, served to bring closure and heal divisions rather than allowing them to fester \u2013 shows that referendums don\u2019t have to be divisive.</p> <p>Amid the dangers ahead, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/10/mps-peter-kyle-phil-wilson-decent-brexit-proposal\" title=\"\">the proposal</a> from MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson shines through the gloom.

Then there can be a proper debate and a proper answer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/03/europe-can-only-give-us-more-time-if-we-have-a-clear-brexit-plan\">Europe can only give us more time if we have a clear Brexit plan  | Tony Blair</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This will require time, which is not on our side \u2013 as a result of May\u2019s incredibly unwise decision to trigger article 50 in March 2017, before there was a negotiating position on the British side.

      "bodyText": "The Brexit debate is coming to a head at a moment when Britain\u2019s political parties seem to be coming apart. Maybe that is not surprising. The 2016 referendum usurped the role of parliament and MPs. And both Labour and Conservative parties are being pulled by the far right and far left. The mess of Brexit is the result. Millions of voters are left feeling not only frustrated but homeless, with unprecedented strain on the stability and legitimacy of the two-party system. The defections from the main parties last month were not just about Brexit. Labour\u2019s antisemitism crisis also reflects dangerous wider trends. It is horrifying to see the Jewish roots of MPs turned into a weapon against their political views; to see sectarianism so deep that reason is lost; to see the anonymity of social media toxify political debate. But while the question of Labour\u2019s future will take some time to resolve, the Brexit question is now down to hours. The prime minister is trapped in what can only be called frenetic paralysis, desperately trying to move forward but unable to do so because of the competing pressures on her. Meanwhile the country heads for the cliff edge. There is only one way to safeguard the political legitimacy, never mind the economic stability, of the country, and that is to re-engage the people. And here is the madness of the current situation: the arguments made against a second referendum apply, in spades, to the prime minister\u2019s deal. It is said that a referendum would be divisive, prolong the Brexit agony, and fuel the far right. But all of these arguments can be made about the prime minister\u2019s deal. It is true that a further referendum will require people to take sides. But we are divided already, because the 2016 referendum made a mockery of the principle of informed consent, and Theresa May\u2019s deal satisfies no one. Leavers say it is not what they voted for. Remainers say their opinion was not properly taken into account. And the choices, as the recent Institute for Fiscal Studies report made clear, are only going to get harder, as the reality of Brexit works its way through the economy. The idea that the May deal will end the Brexit trauma is also misplaced. This deal is only the beginning of the negotiations, and in all likelihood the easiest part. The trade-offs associated with the choice of our Brexit future \u2013 between alignment with European regulation and the exercise of a new-found freedom to deviate \u2013 are only going to get harder. The argument that a second referendum would boost the far right has been presented in cynical terms by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, and in an honourable and serious way by various Labour figures. But the counter case is that the politics of anger represented by nativists and nationalists, on the mainstream right as well as the extreme right, is on the march anyway, and finds vent already. While a referendum would give a platform to Nigel Farage, it is not as if he lacks a platform without a referendum. Ploughing on, when we know that the painful choices that have been avoided by May and Jeremy Corbyn for more than two years will only multiply, is not a salve; it is itself a recipe for more division. May\u2019s bad deal is only an indicator of more pain to come. A further referendum is not just a way for voters to decide whether to incur the economic and social cost of a final Brexit deal. That would be a good reason \u2013 the metaphor of putting down an offer on a house but waiting for the surveyor\u2019s report before deciding whether to sign the contract makes the point. Leading Brexiteers, from Jacob Rees-Mogg to David Davis, previously argued for two referendums as \u201cbookends\u201d of the democratic process. There is nothing undemocratic about giving voters the final say. A referendum is also a way for the country to renew its democracy. Citizens\u2019 assemblies, local debates, new mechanisms of popular engagement, new focus from broadcasters and social media companies on fact-checking and fake news, new protections against Russian interference \u2013 they will all face catcalls that they are high-minded or boring. But they have been shown in other contexts to overcome the danger that it is only those shouting loudest who get heard. There is a danger that the demagogues take over again in the course of another referendum campaign, but only if we neglect the lessons about how to engage voters in a serious way. The evidence from Ireland \u2013 where two referendums covering gay rights and abortion, both core to deeply held views of national identity, served to bring closure and heal divisions rather than allowing them to fester \u2013 shows that referendums don\u2019t have to be divisive. Amid the dangers ahead, the proposal from MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson shines through the gloom. Pass the May deal and put it to a vote. Then there can be a proper debate and a proper answer. This will require time, which is not on our side \u2013 as a result of May\u2019s incredibly unwise decision to trigger article 50 in March 2017, before there was a negotiating position on the British side. The lesson of the past two years is not to rush further, but to use time wisely and sequence decisions sensibly. I didn\u2019t expect to be arguing this case. I spent three years as foreign secretary arguing against Tory demands for a referendum on Europe. I deplored David Cameron\u2019s argument that he had no option but to put a referendum in his 2015 manifesto, and Labour\u2019s decision after the election of that year to vote for the referendum in parliament. But paradoxically I don\u2019t see any way out of the current malaise without doubling down on popular participation in a national vote.

It is going to take creativity and flexibility to get out of it in a way that unites people for the huge challenges of reform and renewal that lie ahead.
