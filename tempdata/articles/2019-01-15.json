What Tomic does not comprehend is that the cycle of survival, triumph and despair in tennis respects no age, no reputation. Few have the luxury of choosing the point of their departure. Murray is at that door now, and still undecided when to walk through it. When he does, unlike Hewitt, he will close it for good.",

      "bodyText": "The New Zealand man accused of murdering British backpacker Grace Millane has pleaded not guilty at Auckland\u2019s high court. The 27-year-old man, whose name has been suppressed by the court, appeared in court on Wednesday morning, his second appearance since his arrest in December last year. Millane, 21, disappeared from central Auckland on 1 December, and her body was found in dense bushland in west Auckland a week later. A memorial was held in her Essex village last week, and attended by the New Zealand detective who led the inquiry into her disappearance. The accused is alleged to have murdered Millane sometime between December 1 and 2 last year, according to court documents seen by the New Zealand Herald. Justice Simon Moore scheduled a murder trial for 4 November, which is expected to last three weeks, the New Zealand Herald reported. Moore repeated warnings to the media and the general public to honour the accused\u2019s name suppression, after numerous UK media outlets published his name and photograph following his first court appearance in December. Members of the public also shared his name and photographs widely on social media platforms and blogs. The accused was denied name suppression at his first court appearance, on 10 December, but his lawyers were given 20 working days to appeal, which expires in late January. The accused has been remanded in custody to next appear in court on 3 April, Stuff reported. Millane was travelling in New Zealand as part of a year-long overseas experience, and was last seen alive on CCTV footage entering the CityLife hotel in central Auckland on the night she disappeared. Grace\u2019s father, David Millane, spent a week in New Zealand following the discovery of his daughter\u2019s body, and thanked the people of New Zealand for their kindness and compassion. \u201cGrace was not born here and only managed to stay a few weeks, but you have taken her to your hearts and in some small way she will forever be a Kiwi,\u201d Millane said. \u201cWe all hope that what has happened to Grace will not deter even one person from venturing out into the world.\u201d Mass candlelit vigils were held for Millane in every major town in New Zealand, and grief experts said many Kiwis experienced \u201cvicarious trauma\u201d about the murder in the usually safe country.",

      "bodyText": "In the middle of 2018 an influential Saudi royal adviser bought an unheralded Egyptian football club, renamed it Pyramids FC and then proceeded to create a new club logo dominated by a sphinx rather than any actual pyramids. Amongst the tens of millions that Turki Al-Sheikh spent was the signing of Syrian defender Omar Midani and if the 24-year-old is confused by his new club\u2019s identity he was even more dumfounded after playing a crucial part in a wild match that saw Australia progress to the round of 16 at the Asian Cup. The Socceroos\u2019 3-2 victory was secured by a stunning late strike from Tom Rogic but before that it was a clash littered with incidents. With Awer Mabil having handed Australia a 41st minute lead only to see it erased two minutes later by Omar Khrbin \u2013 another recent Pyramids FC recruit \u2013 the second half was set up for a tense finale in a match that Australia couldn\u2019t afford to lose. Nine minutes after the restart Chris Ikonomidis put the Socceroos back in front but only after the first in a series of questionable decisions with the Syrian defender, Midani, adamant that he\u2019d managed to scoop the shot off the line. Shortly after the hour, Syrian aggravation turned to infuriation as a ball into the box struck captain Mark Milligan\u2019s arm only for the referee, Cesar Ramos, to wave away those penalty shouts. The Mexican official is part of an exchange program between the AFC and their Concacaf counterparts but just why a referee with little exposure to Asian football was handed such an important fixture is a topic worth debating. That\u2019s even more so the case as he turned from angering Syria to confounding Australia in awarding a penalty against the Socceroos \u2013 that Omar Al Somah converted \u2013 after an incident in which two Syrian players appeared to trip over each other in the penalty box. On the big stage, at crucial points in a decisive match, they were decisions that played a major part in aiding Australia\u2019s progression and eliminating Syria from the competition. Love it or hate it, VAR could have easily cleared up those three issues but the AFC \u2013 for reasons known only to them \u2013 have decided to introduce video technology only from the quarter-final stage onwards. It\u2019s a little bit like making a New Year\u2019s resolution in April. In the end Australia will take the win \u2013 and progression \u2013 any way they can and with Rogic\u2019s brilliant late winner they have solid grounds on which to argue they were the more deserving. Hesitant and sloppy in their passing in a first-up loss to Jordan, the Socceroos improved in a comfortable win over Palestine and have now gone up another gear in seeing off a Syrian side that came within a whisker of dumping them out of World Cup qualification in late 2017. That they did so with only eight substitutes \u2013 including two keepers \u2013 on the bench as suspension and injury robbed the team of numerous starters makes progression all the more impressive. Either Japan or Uzbekistan now await the Socceroos with the former presenting a clash that will rekindle memories of Graham Arnold\u2019s first stint in charge of the national team. On that occasion, back at the 2007 Asian Cup, Japan sent Australia crashing out on penalties in the quarter-finals. Captain Mark Milligan, the only surviving member of that team a decade on, was more interested in focusing on Australia\u2019s progression rather than the controversial calls that blighted the match. \u201cIt\u2019s football, these things happen and sometimes they go for you and sometimes they go against you and we can\u2019t control that but what we can control is the way that we move and run our patterns and our ball speed. \u201cWe showed at the end of this match when we do stick to our principles we get rewarded and it was a good game for us because at times we were dealing with different things and while we\u2019re disappointed that we conceded two in the end I think the result is fair.\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019ll take a lot from the experiences we got today because these are things that you can\u2019t replicate at training, things you can only get by playing games, and you always want to learn your lessons while you\u2019re winning.\u201d After that slow start, that winning feeling has washed over the Socceroos twice in a row and while much of the focus in the UAE remains on the so-called heavyweights of Iran, South Korea and Saudi Arabia, the Socceroos are flying nicely under the radar.

Pro-European Tory MPs were also hoping that the death of May\u2019s deal could open the door for soft Conservative support for a referendum. \u201cThere will come a time when we need to push it in parliament, but you have to allow Labour to exhaust the option of a general election,\u201d one said. \u201cThere are a lot of Conservative MPs who feel duty bound to vote for the deal first time round.

It must be the prime minister who makes the approach, he told the Guardian. \u201cShe serves parliament \u2013 does she come to the people in parliament who have ideas and a substantial body of support?\u201d he said. Before the vote, May holed up in her Commons office behind the Speaker\u2019s chair to speak to Conservative MPs throughout the day. Sources said she focused on backbenchers and Brexiter \u201cringleaders\u201d, such as the former Brexit minister Steve Baker. \u201cThe whipping was purely focused on minimising the margin of defeat, trying to get abstentions,\u201d one Brexiter MP said. One European Research Group (ERG) source said the scale of the defeat had been obvious for months and blamed the whips for their slowness to realise what was coming. \u201cIt might be helpful to remember that when the chief whip came to the weekly ERG meeting the week Chequers was unveiled, he breezily said that if colleagues didn\u2019t like the \u2018deal\u2019, they need not vote for it. And here we all are,\u201d the source said. During the debate the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, hinted he expected May to put a very similar version of the deal to parliament again. \u201cWhatever solution may be fashioned, if this motion were defeated and this deal defeated, this withdrawal agreement will have to return, in much the same form, with much the same content,\u201d he said. Cox, in an impassioned opening to the debate, said he was deeply disturbed by those MPs who had embraced no deal as the best way forward. \u201cWhat are you playing at? What are you doing? You are not children in the playground, you are legislators. We are playing with people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the hard Brexiter who chairs the ERG, speaking earlier, suggested the Commons defeat would give May a clear mandate to seek a new deal, rather than insisting on no deal. He said the prime minister could \u201cgo back with a clear mandate to the EU and say: \u2018Look, if you want a deal, which is in your interest and for which you get \u00a339bn, let\u2019s do something simpler and easier that means we genuinely leave.\u2019\u201d Ben Bradley, the Tory MP for Mansfield, who was among the hard-Brexit rebels, said May had the option of reaching out to her own colleagues or to Labour. \u201cI hope it would be her own colleagues first. When she talks about senior members of the house, she must mean people like Steve Baker and Iain Duncan Smith,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a majority in there, for a free trade agreement and no backstop. That would deliver most Tories who rebelled and Labour leavers,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cShe has ruled out a referendum, ruled out Norway, ruled out a customs union. So she does not have much room with anyone who wants a softer Brexit.\u201d",

A player left our hotel on Saturday morning because we didn\u2019t want him to pass on his virus, but it looks like one or two have picked up what he had. We\u2019ve got a couple on our bench who aren\u2019t feeling 100%. The big issue is our defence. It\u2019s a problem for us but we\u2019ll give it our best shot tonight.

With Newcastle having changed , eight players and a formation for the first meeting at St James\u2019 Park, nobody but Rafa Ben\u00edtez and his team knows what kind of side he is likely to put out tonight. \u201cIt will be the same idea,\u201d said the Spaniard. \u201cWe will look to protect some players and provide some balance. We will try to find the balance with those who played the other day and those who will give us fresh legs.\u201d</p> <p>Newcastle play Cardiff at home on Saturday, an enormously important game for the Premier League\u2019s 18th-placed side, particularly as they have lost to Manchester United and Chelsea in their last two league games and face Manchester City and Tottenham after Neil Warnock\u2019s men. Their focus will surely be on maximising their chances of taking three points from that fixture. \u201cIf it was my decision, you might want to win a game and go into Cardiff at home on the back of a win with your centre forward scoring a goal and keeping a clean sheet,\u201d said Mowbray. \u201cOr you might send the kids and not worry about the result and focus on trying to beat Cardiff.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that Ben\u00edtez has declared that, outside the top six, the only clubs with a chance of winning the Cup are \u201cteams in the middle of the table because they can have a go because they are safe\u201d suggests he\u2019ll go for Option B. He has included Cal Roberts (a 21-year-old winger) and Sean Longstaff (a 21-year-old midfielder), two players who have yet to feature in his first team, in his squad, along perhaps with a few more surprises.</p> <p>A home game against Watford\u2019s second string in round four is at stake.

      "bodyText": "And with that, I\u2019m gone. Bye! Here\u2019s Andy Hunter\u2019s match report: Rafa Benitez has a chat with BT Sport: It\u2019s a big bonus for everyone. The players were working so hard. Really pleased with the effort of everyone. The main thing I said to everyone is everyone was on the pitch giving everything, giving 100%, fighting for each other. And they did it. To win fighting and scoring four goals is better for the confidence of the players. If you win you have more confidence for the net game. The main thing now is to get three point against Cardiff. He also says that he\u2019d be happy to have a Cup run but will keep rotating his squad, and refuses to be drawn on whether Newcastle will be signing anyone in this transfer window. Cal Roberts says he\u2019s happy: It still hasn\u2019t sunk in yet. Just surreal. It\u2019s what you work for, and for it to happen on a night like this, on my first start, it\u2019s great. Playing 90 minutes and a little bit more, it\u2019s what you work for every day. Blackburn\u2019s performance completely petered out in the final 15 minutes, understandably, but they did well with an under-strength side and are unfortunate to lose, when Newcastle\u2019s first goal was a deflection and their third was offside and scored long after the first half of extra-time should have ended. They will look back at Dack\u2019s chance in extra time, the moment when they might have taken control of the tie. 120+3 mins: And that\u2019s it! Blackburn go out, Newcastle go into round four. 120+2 mins: A cross comes in from the right. Schar heads the ball, and Graham heads Schar. Just goes flying right through the middle of him. Both players stay down. 120+1 mins: There will be one minute of stoppage time in this half. There were three in the first! Three! I still can\u2019t get over that. 119 mins: Newcastle fans are ol\u00e9-ing their team\u2019s every touch. 118 mins: The clock is ticking down with Newcastle having a succession of throw-ins on the left flank. 115 mins: Murphy is sent running clear on goal, but Bennett does remarkably well to catch him up inside the penalty area and then slide in from behind to win the ball without conceding a penalty. Murphy gets it back and sets up Joselu, whose attempt is saved. 114 mins: Perez flicks the ball on to Joselu, who blasts a shot goalwards, saved by Raya. He is offside, and this time the linesman spots it. 112 mins: Blackburn win a corner, which is sent towards Dack, level with the near post, but he seems to misjudge its flight and heads only air! 111 mins: The corner goes long, is headed down to Schar, and his shot on the spin flies into the side netting. 110 mins: Murphy pulls the ball back from the byline, Joselu nudges it goalwards, and Raya saves. It didn\u2019t look to me like the ball quite crossed the line, but Newcastle get a corner anyway. 109 mins: Newcastle bring Atsu on for Ritchie, ending the evening\u2019s substitutions. 108 mins: Now Murphy has a go from 50 yards, but Raya doesn\u2019t spill this one. And surely that\u2019s sealed it! The ball is looped into the Blackburn half, with Perez in loads of space running from left to right. He carries it into the penalty area before blasting through Raya, who gets a hand to it but can\u2019t stop it! 106 mins: The fourth half is under way! Elsewhere in the FA Cup tonight, Sheffield Wednesday have beaten Luton 1-0, and Shrewsbury have beaten Stoke 3-2. And that\u2019s half-time in extra time! Blackburn should have scored, Newcastle shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to, but it\u2019s a funny old game, etc and so forth. A stinging shot from distance from Schar, Raya flaps back into play and Joselu taps in! Questions to answer: 1) How were there three minutes of stoppage time at the end of that 15-minute half? 2) How did the linesman not notice how offside Joselu was? 105 mins: What a chance for Blackburn! Graham\u2019s lovely pass into the area is nodded down to Dack, and that was a sitter! He sends the ball rolling wide from 15 yards, with only the goalkeeper in front of him. 105 mins: And Conway sends his shot into the wall. Not just into the wall, but into their shins. 104 mins: Dack is steamrollered by Longstaff, and earns his side a decent shooting chance from the free kick. Conway stands over it. 103 mins: Richie Smallwood\u2019s race is run, and Joe Rothwell comes on for Blackburn. 102 mins: Meanwhile, Schar is holding a thigh. Newcastle\u2019s players are literally falling apart. 100 mins: Hayden is sprayed on the left hip/buttock area with some kind of magic spray, and rises gingerly to his feet. 99 mins: Hayden is down now. I can\u2019t remember seeing anyone having to substitute the substitute of a substitute, but that might be what Newcastle are about to do. 99 mins: Blackburn spend an age with the ball around the edge of Newcastle\u2019s area before finally working some space for Bell, who promptly overhits his cross. Throw-in. 97 mins: Bell crosses from the left, and Nuttall heads wide from 12 yards, with Fernandez getting in his way. 94 mins: Newcastle bring on Ayoze Perez and take off Callum Roberts, scorer of their second goal. 93 mins: Remarkable goings-on in the Cup game at Stoke, where the home side were 2-0 up against Shrewsbury with 20 minutes to play and have just gone 3-2 down with 10 to go. 91 mins: I think the only person who has unequivocally enjoyed this game is Neil Warnock. It\u2019s not been terrible, far from it, but neither side would have volunteered for extra-time pre-match. 91 mins: They\u2019re off! \u201cSomething about Dack\u2019s hairdo makes me think he\u2019s a pirate captain from a bygone era,\u201d says Scott Bassett. \u201cIs there a more pirate-y number in the modern game?\u201d He looks more second-rate boy-band than pirate to me, but I can see where you\u2019re coming from. It\u2019s been a game of two halves, one of which was wildly entertaining, and one of which was less so. We have two more to come. 90+4 mins: That\u2019s it! The teams remain undivided, and we\u2019ll have some extra time! 90+3 mins: Raya catches the corner, and then Fernandez stops him releasing the ball. The referee shows his first yellow card of the evening. 90+2 mins: Longstaff has the ball in the middle, 35 yards out, with runners right, left and centre. He can\u2019t quite find any of them, but the ball is booted out for a corner. 90+1 mins: Conway has a shot from just inside the area, and it deflects off a defender. In the first minute an optimistic shot from a Newcastle player was sent spinning into the net in similar circumstances; this one has all its pace taken off it and rolls straight to Woodman. 90+1 mins: Into stoppage time and this has become extremely scrappy. Three minutes of it will be played. 88 mins: Longstaff\u2019s excellent sliding challenge on Bennett on the half-way line stops a Blackburn counter-attack. 86 mins: Dack\u2019s first shot of the evening, from 30 yards, bounces well wide. 85 mins: Temporarily at least, Blackburn have Newcastle penned into their own half. The crowd roars. They knock a 60 yard pass straight out of play. 82 mins: An error-strewn couple of minutes, which has seen very few passes find their target, ends with a Blackburn goal kick. 81 mins: Ten minutes or so remaining, and extra time looms. 80 mins: For a change, Newcastle push down the right. Ritchie produces a cross that is pure Murphy. Goal kick. 78 mins: Now Harrison Reed is injured, so Blackburn take him off and bring on Bradley Dack, their top scorer. 77 mins: Murphy takes on Reed again. This time what comes out of the Murphy tombola is a useless cross that floats straight out of play. He has switched from right flank to left in this second half, and is doing pretty well there so long as you ignore his final ball. 73 mins: Blackburn make their second change, taking off Adam Armstrong, the scorer of their first goal, and bringing on Joe Nuttall. 72 mins: Blackburn\u2019s momentum has stalled, allowing Newcastle to take the very marginally upper hand. 70 mins: Murphy takes on Reed, inevitably wins the race, but then blasts a left-foot shot over the bar from a very acute angle. 69 mins: Newcastle win a corner, which Hayden diverts just wide of the near post. 67 mins: It looks like he got caught in the chin by a couple of Lenihan\u2019s fingers as the Blackburn man swung his arms for leverage in attempting to win the ball. 66 mins: Blackburn win a free kick and send it towards the back of the box, where Lenihan outjumps Schar. The Newcastle defender goes down clutching his face, though, so the referee has to stop the game. 65 mins: Blackburn bring Brereton off, and Conway on. 64 mins: The ball bounces up in midfield, and Smallwood has a pretty high boot as he challenges Hayden, who goes down in apparent agony. That might have hurt, if only Smallwood had made any contact with Hayden whatsoever. Which he didn\u2019t. 61 mins: Lenihan cleaned out Joselu a moment after he\u2019d met the ball. Chris Sutton on BT Sport is demanding a penalty, but this falls under the Law of the Free Hit, under which a defender or goalkeeper is allowed to do absolutely whatever they want to a forward in the moment after he\u2019s had a shot. 61 mins: Ooooh! Murphy, who is looking the most likely source of further goals for Newcastle, pulls the ball back and Joselu turns it wide at the near post. 57 mins: Lascelles goes off, with Isaac Hayden replacing him. 56 mins: Blackburn pump the ball into the area, and the ball plops off Graham\u2019s head towards Lascelles, who can\u2019t move to it so a Blackburn player gets there first, winning a corner. Woodman catches it, though, so no harm done (except to Lascelles). 55 mins: Lascelles is still on the pitch, and potentially getting more injured with every pace. 54 mins: What a miss! Blackburn pass the ball into the area, Lascelles\u2019 attempt to clear only sends it looping further into the area, and Brereton volleys wastefully wide! 52 mins: Lascelles is still on the pitch, but can hardly walk. Blackburn attack down the left, but Brereton tries to dummy the cross at the near post and there\u2019s only a defender behind him. 51 mins: Ritchie\u2019s left-footed shot from 20 yards flies a yard or so over the bar. 49 mins: Manquillo\u2019s lovely cross from the left seemed to be dipping towards Murphy\u2019s pate, but Bell got his eyebrows to it first and it rolls harmlessly away. 48 mins: Blackburn play the ball down the left and Lascelles shepherds it out of play - but in his final few strides he pulls up, clutching his right hamstring. He\u2019s only been on the pitch for two minutes! 46 mins: Newcastle have brought Lascelles on at the break, replacing Clark, who seemed to be limping at times in the first half. 46 mins: Peeeeep! They\u2019re off! Again! In tonight\u2019s other FA Cup ties, it\u2019s Sheffield Wednesday 0-0 Luton, and Stoke 1-0 Shrewsbury, with Tyrese Campbell grabbing the goal. 45+2 mins: And that\u2019s half time! Blackburn claw their way back from a two-goal deficit to go into the break level! Bell\u2019s lovely crossover turn befuddles a defender but his cross hits another one and goes behind. From the corner Lenihan rises highest and heads powerfully into the far corner! 44 mins: Blackburn win a free kick deep inside their own half, send it forwards and win a free kick deep inside their opponents\u2019 half. This one is sent into the area, and then headed back out of it again. 43 mins: A rare foray forwards for Newcastle ends with Murphy\u2019s shot deflecting behind for a corner, which is flicked on at the near post and headed clear at the far. 42 mins: There has been a total absence of notable incident in recent minutes. Blackburn are dominating possession, but are either inside their own half, or stuck on the flanks. 38 mins: Blackburn give the ball away to Murphy, who has a straightforward chance to play Joselu in with a first-time pass but overhits it, and Raya collects. 35 mins: Lenihan meets the corner with the meatiest chunk of forehead, but the ball flies high. 35 mins: Travis plays a delicious chipped pass down the right flank, and Blackburn win a corner from it. They try something different here! A long ball is pumped up to Graham, who controls well and then finds the perfect pass for Armstrong, whose run into the area has gone entirely unnoticed, and he lifts the ball over Woodman! 32 mins: Blackburn\u2019s main tactic appears to be passing down the left, thumping a crossfield ball to Reed on the right, and then giving it away in short order. 31 mins: Good stat, this. The Newcastle Chronicle published an article about Roberts earlier today, if you\u2019d like to know more. 26 mins: Newcastle win a free kick just inside the centre circle, inside their own half. Schar puts it down and shoots! It\u2019s not a bad effort, either: the ball plops onto the roof of the net, though the goalkeeper would surely have saved it had it been on target. And the ball was moving anyway, so the free kick has to be retaken. 23 mins: Murphy looked offside when the ball was first played through to him there. 22 mins: Murphy is released on the right, beats Nyambe for pace and blasts the ball at the near post. Raya pushes the shot away but Murphy gets it back, centres and Roberts volleys in! Cal Roberts, making his first start for Newcastle, doubles his side\u2019s lead! 20 mins: Danny Graham, who is looking dangerous, nods down to Smallwood, whose shot from the edge of the area deflects to safety. 19 mins: The human one, obviously. 18 mins: I can only assume that the very loud single voice the TV microphones are picking up belongs to Tony Mowbray. He sounds like a contestant on One Man and his Dog. 15 mins: Graham misses from close range! While offside! The ball is chipped over the defence and he controls on his thigh and then prods across goal and beyond the far post. It was a very marginal offside call, but the linesman got it right. 14 mins: Murphy runs down the left, stops as he nears the byline and passes back to Ritchie, whose low shot is saved at the near post. 9 mins: \u201cI\u2019m merely writing to note how much I like Blackburn\u2019s crest,\u201d says Matt Burtz. \u201cI think the single red rose is magnificent. That is all.\u201d I quite like Newcastle\u2019s. Funny seahorses that are half actual horse? Yes please. 6 mins: Smallwood loses the ball to Longstaff in midfield. This is an excellent clash of names. 5 mins: Lots of space in the stands. I think the coldest I have ever been was at Ewood Park one January, many moons ago. Apparently it\u2019s pretty mild tonight, so that\u2019s that excuse out. 2 mins: Longstaff collected a pass about 30 yards out and with his back to goal, bang in the middle of the pitch. He controlled, turned, took a touch and then another (not much by way of closing down here) and then finally shot towards the right side of goal. The ball hit Bell and flew right into the opposite corner, with Raya totally stranded. There were 57 seconds on the clock. A shot from range, a massive deflection and Newcastle have the lead! 1 min: It\u2019s on! Newcastle take the kick-off, roll the ball back to a defender, and he passes it straight into touch. The only way is up. Right, all preambles and preparations are complete. Brace for football! The players are on their way out of the tunnel! I will not mention the B word, but if you\u2019d like news of the evening\u2019s first comprehensive defeat, there\u2019s this: Here\u2019s some snippets from the two managers. First, Rafa Benitez: Always to win is good because it gives you more confidence. We will try to do our best today and try to come through. You know our list of injuries. We have to manage with the squad that we have, but at the same time I\u2019m confident we can go through. The players know each other really well, they know what we want. We\u2019ve approached the game the same as always. And here\u2019s Tony Mowbray: We\u2019ve got a bit of illness, varying degrees of illness. A player left our hotel on Saturday morning because we didn\u2019t want him to pass on his virus, but it looks like one or two have picked up what he had. We\u2019ve got a couple on our bench who aren\u2019t feeling 100%. The big issue is our defence. It\u2019s a problem for us but we\u2019ll give it our best shot tonight. It\u2019s a good challenge for us, a good test against a Premier League side. I know they\u2019ve made changes but they\u2019ve still got a few players that cost a few quid. Apparently Blackburn\u2019s changes are down to an outbreak of illness. \u201cIs it not typical of the current increasing disrespect of the FA Cup that BBC 5 Live are currently covering some \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 rather than the far more important task of a proper build up of this fascinating Third Round tie? The game has gone,\u201d rages Jonathan Denness. Meaningful vote? Is it the X Factor final? Thinking about the team changes for tonight\u2019s game, I wonder why some clubs enter the competition at all (and I\u2019m not only, or even mainly, thinking of Newcastle or Blackburn here). I don\u2019t think entry into the FA Cup is automatic: every club must apply for their place. It\u2019s not even free: it costs \u00a375 to do so. Why bother, if you\u2019re only going to make 10 changes and get knocked out at the earliest opportunity? And when was the last time a top-level club chose not to play in it? Here\u2019s the Press Association\u2019s take on the teams: Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez made eight changes to his starting line-up for the FA Cup third-round replay against Blackburn at Ewood Park. Matt Ritchie, Sean Longstaff and Ciaran Clark were the only survivors from the team that had started Saturday\u2019s 2-1 Premier League loss at Chelsea. Winger Callum Roberts was handed his first Newcastle appearance since making his debut in January 2015. Blackburn\u2019s XI showed five adjustments from their 2-0 Championship win at Millwall, with former Newcastle striker Adam Armstrong among those brought into the side by Tony Mowbray. Some random pre-match reading for you. Nothing to do with this game, either team or the FA Cup, but I wrote it and here it is: That is, I believe, five changes for Blackburn, eight for Newcastle. Team news is in, and this is it: Blackburn: Raya, Nyambe, Lenihan, Travis, Bell, Bennett, Reed, Smallwood, Armstrong, Brereton, Graham. Subs: Rothwell, Leutwiler, Dack, Nuttall, Conway, Butterworth, Grayson. Newcastle: Woodman, Sterry, Fernandez, Schar, Clark, Manquillo, Ritchie, Longstaff, Roberts, Murphy, Joselu. Subs: Lascelles, Rondon, Hayden, Perez, Yedlin, Harker, Atsu. Referee: Lee Probert. \u201cWe just have to prepare ourselves for everything in this game because we are not sure on what is coming,\u201d said Blackburn\u2019s Tony Mowbray about tonight\u2019s test. With Newcastle having changed , eight players and a formation for the first meeting at St James\u2019 Park, nobody but Rafa Ben\u00edtez and his team knows what kind of side he is likely to put out tonight. \u201cIt will be the same idea,\u201d said the Spaniard. \u201cWe will look to protect some players and provide some balance. We will try to find the balance with those who played the other day and those who will give us fresh legs.\u201d Newcastle play Cardiff at home on Saturday, an enormously important game for the Premier League\u2019s 18th-placed side, particularly as they have lost to Manchester United and Chelsea in their last two league games and face Manchester City and Tottenham after Neil Warnock\u2019s men. Their focus will surely be on maximising their chances of taking three points from that fixture. \u201cIf it was my decision, you might want to win a game and go into Cardiff at home on the back of a win with your centre forward scoring a goal and keeping a clean sheet,\u201d said Mowbray. \u201cOr you might send the kids and not worry about the result and focus on trying to beat Cardiff.\u201d The fact that Ben\u00edtez has declared that, outside the top six, the only clubs with a chance of winning the Cup are \u201cteams in the middle of the table because they can have a go because they are safe\u201d suggests he\u2019ll go for Option B. He has included Cal Roberts (a 21-year-old winger) and Sean Longstaff (a 21-year-old midfielder), two players who have yet to feature in his first team, in his squad, along perhaps with a few more surprises. A home game against Watford\u2019s second string in round four is at stake. Kick-off is a 7.45pm GMT. Welcome, and here\u2019s a little reminder of what happened in the first meeting:",

Administrators said the images appeared in a group chat that was active in November and December and featured \u201cracist, sexually inappropriate and threatening commentary\u201d, including one student\u2019s call \u201cto bring knives to school\u201d. The photos and texts have not been released.</p> <p>Cyndi Silverman, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), who has been working with Ojai school officials, told the Guardian that there were 28 students on the group chat, which featured a wide range of hateful content: \u201cThere were a number of texts that were anti-LGBTQ, antisemitic, anti-black, anti-Latino.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/27/antisemitism-us-rises-anti-defamation-league\">Antisemitic incidents in US soar to highest level in two decades</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Antisemitic incidents in the US have recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/27/antisemitism-us-rises-anti-defamation-league\">surged to the highest level in two decades</a>, according to the ADL, which documented <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/27/589119452/anti-semitic-incidents-see-largest-single-year-increase-on-record-audit-finds\">457 cases</a> in K-12 schools in 2017, a 94% increase from the previous year.</p> <p>The local ADL for Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties responded to five antisemitic incidents in 2016, followed by 19 in 2017 and 21 in the last year, Silverman said. Ventura County is a \u201chotbed for white supremacists and the \u2018alt-right\u2019 movement\u201d, she added.</p> <p>The Ojai controversy follows numerous reports across the country of <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/albertsamaha/kids-are-quoting-trump-to-bully-their-classmates\">increased school bullying</a> echoing the hateful rhetoric of Donald Trump, and a rise in harassment, abuse and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/06/05/harvard-withdraws-10-acceptances-for-offensive-memes-in-private-chat/?utm_term=.5349919e9ecb\">offensive language</a> by students on <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/teens-face-relentless-bullying-instagram/572164/\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/6/5/2021-offers-rescinded-memes/\">Facebook</a> and other digital platforms.</p> <p>Of the 28 students in the chat, 12 received a \u201cdisciplinary consequence\u201d due to their participation in the texts or involvement in the swastika incident, the superintendent, Andy Cantwell, said in an email Tuesday.</p> <p>The Matilija <a href=\"https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/education/2019/01/03/students-form-swastika-school-officials-send-out-parent-letter/2471978002/\">student body</a> is <a href=\"https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/dqcensus/EnrEthLevels.aspx?cds=5672520&amp;agglevel=district&amp;year=2017-18\">60.6% white</a>, 31.9% Hispanic or Latino, 1.9% Asian and .7% black. Police investigated and said there were <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-ojai-school-20190103-story.html\">no criminal violations</a>, and the school told parents there was no \u201cactive threat\u201d to students.</p> <p>The incident, however, inspired others to come forward with their own stories, said Silverman, who moderated this week\u2019s public forum with the school and families. One mother who spoke at the meeting said that her son, whose father is Jewish, had received a threatening antisemitic text message that referenced the Holocaust, according to Silverman. Another speaker, a young man of color, talked about experiencing racism and being \u201cjumped\u201d, she said.</p> <p>An assistant superintendent also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andangelo15/status/1085002798222077952\">said</a> at the meeting that the district had seen an increase in students with anxiety and depression, according to a reporter with the Ventura County Star.</p> <p>Some at the meeting voiced concerns about the culpability of the parents of the students in the chat. Silverman said she felt the problem was wider than individual families: \u201cBiased behavior is learned from your environment. We have to look at the whole community at this point and the broader country \u2026 before we blame parents. We\u2019re all responsible.\u201d</p> <p>The local ADL has responded to recent cases involving graffiti with Nazi imagery and a swastika at a synagogue, as well as students in a different district caught making violent misogynistic comments in an online chat, she said. One particularly shocking case involved a five-year-old making violent antisemitic statements to another child, she added.</p> <p>In 2014, a college student in Santa Barbara went on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/20/mass-shooter-elliot-rodger-isla-vista-killings-report\">murderous rampage</a> after expressing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/27/elliot-rodger-was-misogynist-killing-spree\">violent and misogynistic views</a>.</p> <p>Brianna Moffitt, director of education and community outreach with the local ADL, said the Ojai case rippled across the region: \u201cIt\u2019s heightening everyone\u2019s awareness that we have hate in our community. Some of these things are being taught and being learned in our community.\u201d</p> <p>Moffitt said she hoped the case would encourage other school districts to be more proactive in addressing bias and hate speech. </p> <p>Cantwell, the superintendent, said: \u201cAs a district we are developing strategies to promote anti-bias and culturally responsive learning environments,\u201d adding that antisemitism was a \u201cnational problem\u201d. \u201cWe ask the Ojai community to continue to join us in sending the message to all young people that this is wrong,\u201d he said.</p>",

The middle school in Ojai, a small city 80 miles north-west of Los Angeles, told parents in a letter in December that officials had discovered photos showing \u201cnine students laying on the field together to form the shape of a swastika during lunch\u201d. Administrators said the images appeared in a group chat that was active in November and December and featured \u201cracist, sexually inappropriate and threatening commentary\u201d, including one student\u2019s call \u201cto bring knives to school\u201d. The photos and texts have not been released. Cyndi Silverman, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), who has been working with Ojai school officials, told the Guardian that there were 28 students on the group chat, which featured a wide range of hateful content: \u201cThere were a number of texts that were anti-LGBTQ, antisemitic, anti-black, anti-Latino.\u201d Antisemitic incidents in the US have recently surged to the highest level in two decades, according to the ADL, which documented 457 cases in K-12 schools in 2017, a 94% increase from the previous year. The local ADL for Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties responded to five antisemitic incidents in 2016, followed by 19 in 2017 and 21 in the last year, Silverman said. Ventura County is a \u201chotbed for white supremacists and the \u2018alt-right\u2019 movement\u201d, she added. The Ojai controversy follows numerous reports across the country of increased school bullying echoing the hateful rhetoric of Donald Trump, and a rise in harassment, abuse and offensive language by students on Instagram, Facebook and other digital platforms. Of the 28 students in the chat, 12 received a \u201cdisciplinary consequence\u201d due to their participation in the texts or involvement in the swastika incident, the superintendent, Andy Cantwell, said in an email Tuesday. The Matilija student body is 60.6% white, 31.9% Hispanic or Latino, 1.9% Asian and .7% black. Police investigated and said there were no criminal violations, and the school told parents there was no \u201cactive threat\u201d to students. The incident, however, inspired others to come forward with their own stories, said Silverman, who moderated this week\u2019s public forum with the school and families. One mother who spoke at the meeting said that her son, whose father is Jewish, had received a threatening antisemitic text message that referenced the Holocaust, according to Silverman. Another speaker, a young man of color, talked about experiencing racism and being \u201cjumped\u201d, she said. An assistant superintendent also said at the meeting that the district had seen an increase in students with anxiety and depression, according to a reporter with the Ventura County Star. Some at the meeting voiced concerns about the culpability of the parents of the students in the chat. Silverman said she felt the problem was wider than individual families: \u201cBiased behavior is learned from your environment. We have to look at the whole community at this point and the broader country \u2026 before we blame parents. We\u2019re all responsible.\u201d The local ADL has responded to recent cases involving graffiti with Nazi imagery and a swastika at a synagogue, as well as students in a different district caught making violent misogynistic comments in an online chat, she said. One particularly shocking case involved a five-year-old making violent antisemitic statements to another child, she added. In 2014, a college student in Santa Barbara went on a murderous rampage after expressing violent and misogynistic views. Brianna Moffitt, director of education and community outreach with the local ADL, said the Ojai case rippled across the region: \u201cIt\u2019s heightening everyone\u2019s awareness that we have hate in our community. Some of these things are being taught and being learned in our community.\u201d Moffitt said she hoped the case would encourage other school districts to be more proactive in addressing bias and hate speech. Cantwell, the superintendent, said: \u201cAs a district we are developing strategies to promote anti-bias and culturally responsive learning environments,\u201d adding that antisemitism was a \u201cnational problem\u201d. \u201cWe ask the Ojai community to continue to join us in sending the message to all young people that this is wrong,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has offered no encouragement to supporters of a second EU referendum after he called for a vote of no confidence in Theresa May\u2019s government and an immediate general election. The Labour leader did not refer to a second referendum in his two Brexit speeches on Tuesday evening, and risked antagonising the party\u2019s pro-remain wing, some of whom want him to back another poll by the end of the week. In his first, longer speech at the end of the full Brexit debate, Corbyn said: \u201cLabour believes that a general election would be the best outcome for the country if this deal is rejected tonight.\u201d He argued that despite differences of opinion over Brexit, membership of the European Union was not the most important issue facing the country. \u201cWe need to keep in mind that the vast majority of people in our country don\u2019t think of themselves as remainers or leavers,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether they voted leave or remain two and a half years ago, they are concerned about their future.\u201d One shadow cabinet member who supports a second referendum said they believed that opposition to a second referendum was hardening among Corbyn\u2019s allies, with senior figures preparing to resist pressure to push for one. However, Chuka Umunna, a leading campaigner for a second referendum, said Corbyn \u201cwould face increasing demands to hold a people\u2019s vote by the end of the week\u201d, assuming May won Wednesday\u2019s confidence vote as expected. An estimated 72% of party members want a second referendum, according to polling released at the turn of the year by the Economic and Social Research Council, and 89% of those surveyed think it was wrong for the UK to leave the EU. Michael Chessum, a Corbyn supporter and spokesman for leftwing pro-EU pressure group Another Europe is Possible, said that Labour members would be pleased that Corbyn had tabled an immediate vote of no confidence, arguing that it represented \u201ca great moment of unity for the next 24 hours\u201d. Another Europe is Possible is already mobilising Labour members in support of a second referendum. Chessum argued that it was important that the leadership moved \u201csooner rather than later to a people\u2019s vote\u201d and warned it could become a wedge issue if there was a divergence between the perceived position of the leadership and the membership over this issue. There have also been divisions among Labour MPs who have been critical of Corbyn, with several senior figures, such as Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn, preferring to support Tory MP Nick Boles\u2019 bill that would allow parliament to take control of the Brexit process. Cooper called on May to work with all MPs to find a solution to the impasse. She tweeted: \u201cPM says she now will listen and work cross party but she had 30 months to do that and she repeatedly refused. She cannot just carry on as if nothing has changed.\u201d Benn, the chair of the Brexit select committee, said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s Brexit agreement has been defeated by a majority of 230. Astonishing and unprecedented. The big question now is this. Will she listen?\u201d The party has a limited amount of time to consider its position because May has to table a fresh Brexit motion on Monday, with a series of amendments submitted by MPs to come in the days after. The People\u2019s Vote campaign has been considering whether to submit an amendment calling for a second referendum at that point. It would probably be put down in the name of the Conservative backbencher Sarah Wollaston. However, the Labour leadership\u2019s hostility to the idea is so strong that the campaign has been considering a further delay. Insiders have said they wanted the second referendum option to be \u201cthe last one standing\u201d after all other alternatives have been exhausted. Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said after the vote that \u201ca motion of no confidence can happen more than once\u201d, suggesting the party could try for some time to force a general election. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, was expected to listen closely to views within the parliamentary party in the coming days in recognition of the wide range of opinions. A drop-in session held on Monday with 30 to 40 Labour MPs saw \u201cevery shade of opinion expressed\u201d, according to one of those present. The party\u2019s Brexit policy, signed off at its annual conference in September, said all options, including a second referendum, would be considered if Labour could not secure a general election. But the party\u2019s spokesman said Labour \u201crespects the result of the referendum in 2016, which is why we supported the triggering of article 50\u201d.

The advertisement features news clips of reporting on the #MeToo movement, as well as images showing sexism in films, in boardrooms, and of violence between boys, with a voice over saying: \u201cBullying, the MeToo movement against sexual harassment, toxic masculinity, is this the best a man can get?\u201d The film, called We Believe: the Best Men Can Be, immediately went viral with more than 4m views on YouTube in 48 hours and generated both lavish praise and angry criticism. \u201cThis commercial isn\u2019t anti-male.

She has spent two years negotiating a deal, which in substance was the opposite of what she said she wanted in public, only to see it repudiated by parliament. Her minority government has now been <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/01/15/could-crucial-vote-post-war-history/\" title=\"\">defeated</a> on no fewer than 28 occasions. Britain is leaving the EU in weeks and Mrs May leads a cabinet that is hopelessly split, a party that is riven with disagreements and a country that is deeply divided. So emphatic is the Commons historic rebuff that Mrs May\u2019s deal is finished. Mrs May lost by 230 votes \u2013 the greatest defeat of a government ever. The scale of the opposition means it is not credible Mrs May could bring the motion back to the Commons, modified with a few tweaks from Brussels, and hope for success a second time round.</p> \n<p>We do not have to settle for the Hobson\u2019s choice of the May deal or no deal.

      "bodyText": "The overwhelming and decisive rejection by MPs of Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement to leave the European Union is a shattering blow to the authority of the prime minister. She has spent two years negotiating a deal, which in substance was the opposite of what she said she wanted in public, only to see it repudiated by parliament. Her minority government has now been defeated on no fewer than 28 occasions. Britain is leaving the EU in weeks and Mrs May leads a cabinet that is hopelessly split, a party that is riven with disagreements and a country that is deeply divided. So emphatic is the Commons historic rebuff that Mrs May\u2019s deal is finished. Mrs May lost by 230 votes \u2013 the greatest defeat of a government ever. The scale of the opposition means it is not credible Mrs May could bring the motion back to the Commons, modified with a few tweaks from Brussels, and hope for success a second time round. We do not have to settle for the Hobson\u2019s choice of the May deal or no deal. The trouble is the Tory party is split between those who want a deal and those who do not. Mrs May has intensified the divisions within her party, rather than resolve them. She chose to start negotiations over Brexit not with the EU but with her own hardliners. The red lines Mrs May subsequently set made it impossible for her to get a deal that would bring her fractious party together, let alone reach out to her political opponents. Her agreement ended up shaped by Mrs May\u2019s obsession with immigration and placating Brexit extremists.

Once she had committed to leave the single market, customs union and jurisdiction of the European court of justice, and once she accepted that there could be no hard border in Ireland, then she had all but written the withdrawal agreement that MPs rejected tonight. The EU laws of physics dictated that there could be almost no other outcome.</p> \n<p>Of course, May\u2019s drawing of those red lines was itself the fruit of another choice, a political calculation that her best hope lay with placating the hardest Brexiteers in her party. She had seen how the Europhobic wing of British Conservatism had devoured so many of her predecessors, and concluded that her own safety required her to placate that faction. Only later did she learn what her predecessors could have told her: that the Europhobes\u2019 demands can never be met because what they want \u2013 cake in both its having and eating modes \u2013 is impossible.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>This has been Britain\u2019s European story, repeatedly seeing what was a project of peace as a scam designed to swindle the Brits of their money</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In this she was repeating an error made by David Cameron in 2013, when he announced that there would be an in/out referendum before 2017. He, too, was seeking to placate the hard Brexiteers, seeking to blunt the appeal of Ukip. That was another fateful decision on the road to the vote tonight, one that failed to see that asking voters to approve the status quo in the post-crash era was asking to be punched hard in the face. Critical, too, was Cameron\u2019s conduct of the referendum campaign, with its serial failures: its appeal to voters\u2019 wallets rather than their hearts, its refusal to attack the Tory leaders of the leave campaign, its complacency.</p> \n<p>But Cameron also deserves blame for the manner of his departure. Had he delayed his resignation, he could have been around to frame what the referendum result meant. He could have said, for example, that Britons had voted to leave the EU but had not voted to leave either the single market or customs union, since neither were on the ballot paper. Britons clearly wanted out of the EU\u2019s political institutions, he might have said, but they had not rejected membership of the common market. And so he could have advanced a Norway-style Brexit, one that would have minimised the harm. Instead he fled the scene of his own crime, leaving a vacuum into which rival definitions of Brexit could rush. Within weeks of his exit, Brexit was redefined in the hardest terms.</p> \n<p>All these decisions by May and Cameron laid the path to the vote tonight. But, in truth, the path is much longer and older. For at least three decades, \u201cEurope\u201d served as the all-purpose bogeyman of British politics. Cheered on by a Europe\u2011loathing press, itself fuelled by an endless flow of straight banana-type lies, many of them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/26/boris-johnson-latest-euro-myth-brexit\" title=\"\">concocted by a Telegraph correspondent in Brussels by the name of Boris Johnson</a>, politicians of all stripes found it convenient to blame Brussels for any and all ills.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/15/theresa-may-loses-brexit-deal-vote-by-majority-of-230\">Theresa May loses Brexit deal vote by majority of 230</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>How easy it was for British politicians to say they\u2019d love to act on this or that issue, but their hands were tied by those villains in the EU. Every summit was a \u201cshowdown\u201d pitting plucky Britain against the wicked continentals. Both of the main political parties played this game. Recall Gordon Brown\u2019s reluctance to be photographed signing the Lisbon treaty. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/dec/13/politics.world\" title=\"\">In the end he signed the treaty in a small room, alone</a> \u2013 an early metaphor for the Brexit to come.) Given how long, and how bitterly, the fight against Europe had been fought, what\u2019s remarkable is not how few Britons voted remain in 2016 but how many.</p> \n<p>Or you could go further back still. The Suez fiasco of 1956 was meant to have cured Britain of its imperial delusion, but what\u2019s clear now is that many Britons never quite made that adjustment. Underpinning Brexit, with its belief that Britain should separate itself from its closest neighbours, is a refusal to accept that we are one part of an interdependent European economy. For the Brexiteers, Britain remains a global Gulliver tied down for too long by the Lilliputians of Little Europe. It is a fundamental misreading of our place in the world.</p> \n<p>Perhaps, though, the seeds of the vote were planted in the rubble of Britain\u2019s wartime experience. Never occupied, many Britons never understood the intense need for the EU as continental Europeans feel it. In 1984, at a ceremony to honour the fallen of Verdun, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl held hands, in a powerful gesture of Franco-German reconciliation. <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2013/09/26/unknown-maggie-thatcher/\" title=\"\">According to her biographer</a>, Margaret Thatcher was unmoved, instead mocking the sight of two grown men holding hands.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/15/europe-brexit-meaningful-vote\">A polite request from Europe: wake us up when you know what you want from Brexit | Joris Luyendijk</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This has been Britain\u2019s European story, repeatedly seeing what was a project of peace, designed to end centuries of bloodshed, as a scam designed to swindle the Brits of their money. You can go further back, to repeated wars against the French, the Spanish and the Germans. Or you can go further back still to the first Brexit nearly five centuries ago, when Henry VIII sought to take back control by breaking from Rome.</p> \n<p>Wherever you choose the starting point, the end point is clear enough. It ends like this, in the sight of a parliament paralysed by indecision, still unable to embrace Europe \u2013 but just as unable to break away. And in the spectacle of a country lost and adrift.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Of course, May\u2019s drawing of those red lines was itself the fruit of another choice, a political calculation that her best hope lay with placating the hardest Brexiteers in her party. She had seen how the Europhobic wing of British Conservatism had devoured so many of her predecessors, and concluded that her own safety required her to placate that faction. Only later did she learn what her predecessors could have told her: that the Europhobes\u2019 demands can never be met because what they want \u2013 cake in both its having and eating modes \u2013 is impossible. In this she was repeating an error made by David Cameron in 2013, when he announced that there would be an in/out referendum before 2017. He, too, was seeking to placate the hard Brexiteers, seeking to blunt the appeal of Ukip. That was another fateful decision on the road to the vote tonight, one that failed to see that asking voters to approve the status quo in the post-crash era was asking to be punched hard in the face. Critical, too, was Cameron\u2019s conduct of the referendum campaign, with its serial failures: its appeal to voters\u2019 wallets rather than their hearts, its refusal to attack the Tory leaders of the leave campaign, its complacency. But Cameron also deserves blame for the manner of his departure. Had he delayed his resignation, he could have been around to frame what the referendum result meant. He could have said, for example, that Britons had voted to leave the EU but had not voted to leave either the single market or customs union, since neither were on the ballot paper. Britons clearly wanted out of the EU\u2019s political institutions, he might have said, but they had not rejected membership of the common market. And so he could have advanced a Norway-style Brexit, one that would have minimised the harm. Instead he fled the scene of his own crime, leaving a vacuum into which rival definitions of Brexit could rush. Within weeks of his exit, Brexit was redefined in the hardest terms. All these decisions by May and Cameron laid the path to the vote tonight. But, in truth, the path is much longer and older. For at least three decades, \u201cEurope\u201d served as the all-purpose bogeyman of British politics. Cheered on by a Europe\u2011loathing press, itself fuelled by an endless flow of straight banana-type lies, many of them concocted by a Telegraph correspondent in Brussels by the name of Boris Johnson, politicians of all stripes found it convenient to blame Brussels for any and all ills. How easy it was for British politicians to say they\u2019d love to act on this or that issue, but their hands were tied by those villains in the EU. Every summit was a \u201cshowdown\u201d pitting plucky Britain against the wicked continentals. Both of the main political parties played this game. Recall Gordon Brown\u2019s reluctance to be photographed signing the Lisbon treaty. (In the end he signed the treaty in a small room, alone \u2013 an early metaphor for the Brexit to come.) Given how long, and how bitterly, the fight against Europe had been fought, what\u2019s remarkable is not how few Britons voted remain in 2016 but how many. Or you could go further back still. The Suez fiasco of 1956 was meant to have cured Britain of its imperial delusion, but what\u2019s clear now is that many Britons never quite made that adjustment. Underpinning Brexit, with its belief that Britain should separate itself from its closest neighbours, is a refusal to accept that we are one part of an interdependent European economy. For the Brexiteers, Britain remains a global Gulliver tied down for too long by the Lilliputians of Little Europe. It is a fundamental misreading of our place in the world. Perhaps, though, the seeds of the vote were planted in the rubble of Britain\u2019s wartime experience. Never occupied, many Britons never understood the intense need for the EU as continental Europeans feel it. In 1984, at a ceremony to honour the fallen of Verdun, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl held hands, in a powerful gesture of Franco-German reconciliation. According to her biographer, Margaret Thatcher was unmoved, instead mocking the sight of two grown men holding hands. This has been Britain\u2019s European story, repeatedly seeing what was a project of peace, designed to end centuries of bloodshed, as a scam designed to swindle the Brits of their money. You can go further back, to repeated wars against the French, the Spanish and the Germans. Or you can go further back still to the first Brexit nearly five centuries ago, when Henry VIII sought to take back control by breaking from Rome. Wherever you choose the starting point, the end point is clear enough. It ends like this, in the sight of a parliament paralysed by indecision, still unable to embrace Europe \u2013 but just as unable to break away. And in the spectacle of a country lost and adrift. \u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "And finally, there\u2019s been wild swings in the currency markets as Theresa May suffers a historic defeat over her Brexit deal. Sterling slid to $1.266, lowest since January 4th, as investors reacted to the sheer scale of the defeat -- a majority of 230 MPs opposed the plan. But it then staged a Lazarus-like recovery, back over $1.283, as May challenge the opposition to table a no-confidence vote, and Jeremy Corbyn promptly obliged. It\u2019s still not clear what will happen next - the deal looks dead, but May may attempt to revive it. Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, comments: \u201cTonight\u2019s confused sterling price action reflects the fact that the pound was already trading with significant downside risk priced in. It seems that for now, market participants have faith in the supposed majority that exists for avoiding a no deal, and are at least a little encouraged by the prospect that the chaos results in a delay or a softening of Brexit. A nightmare scenario for sterling would be a standoff where May sees off the vote of no confidence but still can\u2019t pass a bill, and so is forced to continue to run down the clock while refusing to offer any real alternatives or call a referendum. Such a game of chicken would substantially increase the risk of miscalculation or deadlock leading to no deal and send sterling towards parity against the euro. \u201cThe outcome of the vote of no confidence is obviously the first major question for sterling at this point. Our view is that tonight\u2019s small sterling rally reflects the marginal increase in the chance of a Labour-led soft Brexit, so if May falls we could see further sterling strength. The pandemonium of a general election, however, could well end up as a net negative as the polls change from day to day.\u201d You can track all the action here: When the pound goes down, the FTSE 100 often goes up, as it has today.... Something for currency traders (and the rest of us) to digest: The fortunes of the pound tonight will be determined by the size of Theresa May\u2019s defeat. Tyler Griffin, currency specialist at OFX, said: Looking ahead, anything close to 100 votes would cause upside for the pound, however if May loses by more than 150 votes, there would be further turmoil for sterling which could tumble to below 1.25 versus the US Dollar.\u201d In the currency markets, sterling is under pressure as parliament prepares to vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal - and surely inflict a historic defeat on the PM. With the US dollar generally stronger, the pound has dropped by one and a half cents to $1.2723. That\u2019s a chunky move, but it only takes sterling back to last week\u2019s levels. The City isn\u2019t really sure what to expect with Brexit, but there\u2019s a theory that sterling assets should rally if the threat of no deal was taken away. Joel Kruger of LMAX Exchange argues that anything short of a hard Brexit will be very good for the value of the pound. \u201cWe believe the most critical takeaway with respect to the outlook for the UK economy is that there are no parties involved that would benefit from a no deal Brexit outcome. This puts a beaten down Pound and UK assets in position to outperform in 2019, as the tail risk event of no deal Brexit is truncated.\u201d Sterling is also down around 0.35% against the euro (which is also down against the dollar) at \u20ac1.118. Our Politics Live blog has all the action: With some of the early optimism over China\u2019s stimulus pledge fading, the FTSE 100 has closed 40 points higher at 6,895 tonight. Beijing\u2019s pledge to cut taxes and maintain plenty of liquidity is still welcome, but analysts are questioning quite how quickly it will happen, and how much impact it will have. The German and French markets also handed back some gains, but still finished higher (0.33% and 0.5%). David Madden of CMC Markets says: European equity markets are a mixed bag this afternoon. The major equity benchmarks started off strong today after Beijing announced plans overnight to trim the tax rate for small businesses. It was the latest move by the Chinese government to try and encourage economic activity. The fact that a large portion of the gains have been handed back suggests that investors are not overly confident the Chinese economy will suddenly stop cooling. The firmer oil price has helped BP and Royal Dutch Shell, which in turn has helped the FTSE 100. Here\u2019s Jamie Rowlands, partner at City law firm Gowling WLG, on China\u2019s pledge overnight to cut business taxes: This seems to be an attempt to stimulate domestic SME-type businesses in an environment where China\u2019s economic strength is in question \u2013 albeit still more robust than much of the rest of the world. Definitely an internal financial boost incentive rather than international. Wall Street has opened a little higher this morning, as traders absorb China\u2019s pledge to stimulate its economy. The tech-focused Nasdaq index is leading the way, thanks to Netflix which has announced price hikes (sending its shares up 6%). Auto news: Ford and Volkswagen have announced details of a new alliance. The deal is designed to cut the cost of the technological revolution now shaking the industry and deal with slowing sales. My colleague Dominic Rushe explains: The companies will start with the development of commercial vans and mid-size pickups but the alliance will also involve sharing resources on autonomous vehicles, mobility services and electric vehicles. \u201cOver time, this alliance will help both companies create value and meet the needs of our customers and society,\u201d Ford\u2019s chief executive, Jim Hackett, said at the Detroit auto show He said the deal would give the companies \u201cthe opportunity to collaborate on shaping the next era of mobility\u201d. No word on the impact on jobs. Last week, Ford Europe announced thousands of job cuts, as the industry reels from the slowdown in China and the diesel emissions scandal. Donald Trump may have blown Davos out this year (blame the shutdown over his border wall), but plenty of other world leaders will be making the trek to the snowy ski resort. The World Economic Forum have just announced the list of attendee\u2019s for next week\u2019s event. Topping the list are two G7 leaders - Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel and Japan\u2019s Shinzo Abe. Brazil\u2019s new right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, is another big name, while China will be represented by Wang Qishan, Vice-President of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Also in attendance are: Giuseppe Conte, Prime Minister of Italy; Pedro Sanchez, Prime Minister of Spain; Barham Salih, President of Iraq; Mohammad Ashraf Ghani, President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan; Sebastian Kurz, Federal Chancellor of Austria; Ivan Duque, President of Colombia; Abiy Ahmed, Prime Minster of Ethiopia; Leo Varadkar, Taoiseach of the Republic of Ireland; Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel; Faiez Al Serrag, Prime Minister of Libya; Mark Rutte, Prime Minister of the Netherlands; Jacinda Ardem, Prime Minister of New Zealand; Erna Solberg, Prime Minister of Norway; Rami Hamdallah, Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority; Martin Alberto Vizcarra Cornejo, President of Peru; Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda; Cyril M. Ramaphosa, Prime Minister of South Africa; Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of Uganda; Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Prime Minister of Viet Nam; and Emmerson Mnangagwa, President of Zimbabwe. Heads of the major international bodies are also attending, including the WTO\u2019s Roberto Azevedo, the OECD\u2019s Angel Gurr\u00eda, and Christine Lagarde of the IMF. No mention of Theresa May, but perhaps she\u2019s waiting to see how this week\u2019s Brexit votes pan out.... ...instead, Prince William and David Attenborough will be flying the flag for the UK, talking about environmental issues, and mental health. Assuming we can make it through the mountains of snow next week.... In what may well be rare good news today, Greek bond yields have hit a one-month low. Greece\u2019s debt is strengthening on expectation that prime minister Alexis Tsipras will survive a parliamentary vote of confidence prompted by the departure of the right-wing Independent Greeks party, ANEL, from his ruling coalition. The leftist leader kicked off a two-day debate over the censure motion appealing to MPs to renew their confidence in the government in the name of \u201cpatriotic interest towards history and democracy.\u201d \u201cWe have before us many big political initiatives that must not be delayed,\u201d he told the House before singling out increasing the minimum wage as one of the reforms. Yields on ten-year bonds fell 2bps to 4.267%, while five-year bonds were down 3bps to 3.21% reflecting investor confidence that the government will survive the vote. Tsipras\u2019 Syriza party controls 145 seats in the 300-member parliament but at least six opposition MPs (including four from ANEL) have said they will back the government. Addressing parliament, Tsipras spoke more out of sorrow than anger about ANEL leader Panos Kammenos\u2019 decision to withdraw from the coalition over the landmark accord to change neighbouring Macedonia\u2019s name - a deal that must now be ratified by Greek MPs after being endorsed by the Skopje parliament. Parliament\u2019s speaker has called the ballot be held at midnight tomorrow - in a revisit of similar votes at the height of the euro crisis even if tomorrow\u2019s is unlikely to be a cliffhanger of the kind that we all once witnessed. Newsflash: US banking giant JP Morgan is urging politicians in Washington to work together, after missing Wall Street forecasts. JP Morgan has just reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.98 in the last quarter, below estimates of $2.21 per share. Recent market ructions seems to have hurt the bank; net income at its investment bank fell 15%, partly due to a weakness at its fixed-income division (bond trading). CEO Jamie Dimon says it was a challenging quarter, as \u201cvolatility and lower market levels\u201d hit its bottom line. And as the US government shutdown enters its 25th day, Dimon is pushing Capitol Hill to help the economy: As we head into 2019, we urge our country\u2019s leaders to strike a collaborative, constructive tone, which would reinforce already-strong consumer and business sentiment. Businesses, government and communities need to work together to solve problems and help strengthen the economy for the benefit of everyone.\u201d Shoppers at 17 towns and cities around the UK are losing their local Marks &amp; Spencer, as the retailer implements its restructuring plan. The proposed closures will cost 1,000 jobs, and hurt the high streets from Huddersfield and Hull to Ashford and Felixstowe. Elsewhere in the eurozone, shares in Italian banks are sliding after they were told to set aside more capital to cover bad loans. Reuters has the details: The European Central Bank has asked lenders it oversees to put aside more money to fully cover their impaired loans by around 2026, Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore reported on Tuesday citing a source. The report focused in particular on Italian banks, saying the country\u2019s lenders were burdened by the highest amount of impaired loans in Europe. UBI Banca, Italy\u2019s fifth-largest bank, has slumped by almost 10% today, as investors fret about the ECB\u2019s move. Banco BPM SpA, the third-largest lender, has shed 8.6%, while market leader Unicredit has lost 3%. Germany\u2019s growth pains are part of a wider slowdown across Europe. Oxford Economics reckons eurozone growth will drop to just 1.5% this year, from 1.8% in 2018 - and a sizzling 2.7% in 2017. Here\u2019s some snap reaction to the German growth data: Why did Germany\u2019s growth rate slide to just 1.5% last year, from 2.2%? Germany\u2019s finance ministry has blamed a handful of factors, including: A weaker global economy -- growth in China, and across the eurozone, certainly slowed last year. New car emission tests -- Germany\u2019s auto industry has been struggling to meet these tougher standards, and get their models approved. The economy ministry also blame \u201can outbreak of flu, low water levels hampering shipping and strikes\u201d for the slowdown. It also believes the economy will keep expanding in 2019 - defying fears of a recession. Newsflash: Germany\u2019s economy has grown at its slowest rate in five years, a fresh sign that the global economy is cooling. Europe\u2019s largest economy only expanded by 1.5% in 2018, down from 2.2% growth in 2016 and 2017. The Federal Statistics Office (Destatis) says: The German economy thus grew the ninth year in a row, although growth has lost momentum. Destatis also reckons the economy probably grew in October-December, having shrunk in July-September. If so, that would mean Germany avoided falling into a technical recession (we\u2019ll find out for sure next month, when Q4 data is released). Germany appears to have been hurt by the US-China trade war, which has dampened global demand, and thus the market for its goods. Recent data as shown that factory orders and industrial output fell this autumn. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management says China\u2019s pledge to cut taxes is an example of \u201cpom-pom waving cheerleading is likely to become a regular feature of the Chinese economic landscape\u201d. European stock markets have followed Asia\u2019s lead. They\u2019re all comfortably higher this morning, clawing back Monday\u2019s losses. European car shares have jumped by 2.2%, to their highest levels in five weeks, thanks to China\u2019s stimulus pledge. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has jumped by over 50 points, or 0.8%, at the start of trading. Mining stocks are leading the charge, with Rio Tinto, Anglo American and Glencore all up at least 1.5%. They\u2019ll all benefit from increased demand for commodities if China\u2019s economy picks up. Beijing is signalling that it is prepared to do whatever it can to avoid a hard landing, says Konstantinos Anthis, Head of Research at ADSS. News that China is about to implement another round of tax cuts supports the notion that the Asian nation will do as much as possible to support the domestic economy and avoid a steep slowdown. Stocks have jumped across Asia today, following China\u2019s pledge to cut taxes. China\u2019s benchmark index, the CSI 300, surged by 2% as investors welcomed today\u2019s stimulus measures. Japan\u2019s Topix gained almost 1%, with Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 close behind. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada points out that the plan remains sketchy: Chinese officials are quoted as saying the government will cut taxes \u201con a larger scale\u201din 2019, especially for small businesses and manufacturing. There are no details, but the news was enough to reverse yesterday\u2019s sell-off. China\u2019s stock market lost a quarter of its value in 2018, so Shanghai traders are understandably eager for good news. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The markets are bouncing back today as Chinese policymakers vow to take action to spur growth, and ward off an economic slump. China\u2019s finance ministry has pledged to slash taxes, to reduce the burden on small firms, as part of a new stimulus drive. Under the plan, Beijing will cut value-added tax rates for some companies, including in manufacturing, and hand tax rebates to others. China also plans to step up fiscal expenditure this year, in what looks like a Keynesian push to help companies. Xu Hongcai, Assistant Minister of Finance, told reporters in Beijing that the government was determined to ease the burden on small enterprises and the manufacturing industry, adding: The focus is on enhancement and efficiency. In a co-ordinated move to reassure markets, China\u2019s central bank has promised to make monetary policy more forward-looking, flexible and targeted. The People\u2019s Bank of China also vowed to keep liquidity \u201creasonably ample\u201d - which could calm worries that firms could run short of funds. The country\u2019s state planner has also weighed in. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said China will strengthen monitoring of its economic situation and improve its \u201creserve\u201d of economic policies, as it targets \u201ca good start\u201d to 2019. These moves comes a day after Chinese exporters suffered the biggest drop in overseas sales in almost two years. Also coming up today City traders will be watching Westminster closely tonight, to see whether Theresa May can get her Brexit vote through (unlikely). Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says the scale of the likely defeat will be crucial for the pound: If she suffers a loss by a narrow margin, it may be positive news to Sterling, as May can head back to Brussels for more concessions which could be enough to pass the bill in a second \u201cPlan B\u201d vote. However, a loss by a wide margin will make it tricky for Sterling traders as the bill will be rejected due to different ambitions. Conservative MPs want concessions that are hard to get from Brussels, meanwhile, hardcore remainers want to reject the deal in the hope that they get a second referendum. This may lead to two extreme outcomes: either a hard Brexit or no Brexit at all. However, given all the uncertainty towards such a scenario, investors may sell the currency and assess the situation later, leading to high volatile moves in the Pound. Plus, we get new eurozone trade figures, and a healthcheck on US manufacturing The agenda 10am GMT: Eurozone trade balance for November 1.30pm GMT: US Empire manufacturing data",

The city is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/14/gdansk-residents-donate-blood-stabbed-mayor-pawel-adamowicz\">in mourning</a>.</p> \n<p>The people of Gda\u0144sk are coming to terms with the death of their mayor, Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz, who was stabbed on stage at a charity concert in front of thousands of people on Sunday. A public appeal led to crowds of people queueing for hours to donate blood to save their mayor, but he was pronounced dead on Monday afternoon.</p> \n<p>At the Red Light, people console each other between shots dedicated to Adamowicz. Adela Szczepa\u0144ska-Ko\u015bcielnik was at the concert when the attack happened. It was the local finale of a nationwide charity drive, the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity, which raises funds to buy equipment for children\u2019s units in state-run hospitals. The concerts end with a countdown towards the moment when fundraising stops and people raise lights in the air in celebration. Adamowicz was leading the countdown; the attack was timed to coincide with the moment it reached zero.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt the end of the countdown we didn\u2019t understand what happened. There was no light, no music. A girl started screaming: \u2018They killed him! They killed him!\u2019 We were confused, some people thought it was a joke.

With tears running down people\u2019s faces, the crowd stood motionless as they listened to an a capella version of Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s Sound of Silence.</p> \n<p>This was silence with a purpose \u2013 not only to mourn, but to protest against an increasing prevalence of hate speech in Polish public discourse that Adamowicz had attempted to confront. A staunch defender of migrants and refugees and of LGBT rights, he had marketed Gda\u0144sk as a liberal enclave, a city in open defiance of the xenophobic nationalism promoted by Poland\u2019s rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS), which has governed since 2015.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am a European so my nature is to be open,\u201d Adamowicz told the Guardian in 2016. \u201cGda\u0144sk is a port and must always be a refuge from the sea.\u201d</p> \n<p>His liberal stance cast him as a hate figure for government supporters and the far right.

      "bodyText": "The music has been switched off at the Red Light pub in the heart of the picturesque old town of Gda\u0144sk. A single candle adorned with a black ribbon rests on the bar. The city is in mourning. The people of Gda\u0144sk are coming to terms with the death of their mayor, Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz, who was stabbed on stage at a charity concert in front of thousands of people on Sunday. A public appeal led to crowds of people queueing for hours to donate blood to save their mayor, but he was pronounced dead on Monday afternoon. At the Red Light, people console each other between shots dedicated to Adamowicz. Adela Szczepa\u0144ska-Ko\u015bcielnik was at the concert when the attack happened. It was the local finale of a nationwide charity drive, the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity, which raises funds to buy equipment for children\u2019s units in state-run hospitals. The concerts end with a countdown towards the moment when fundraising stops and people raise lights in the air in celebration. Adamowicz was leading the countdown; the attack was timed to coincide with the moment it reached zero. \u201cAt the end of the countdown we didn\u2019t understand what happened. There was no light, no music. A girl started screaming: \u2018They killed him! They killed him!\u2019 We were confused, some people thought it was a joke. The city has never been so sad, it is as if someone cut the electricity.\u201d After the announcement of the mayor\u2019s death on Monday, thousands of people gathered at the statue of Neptune in the city\u2019s Long Market, also home to city hall, where Adamowicz served for more than 20 years. With tears running down people\u2019s faces, the crowd stood motionless as they listened to an a capella version of Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s Sound of Silence. This was silence with a purpose \u2013 not only to mourn, but to protest against an increasing prevalence of hate speech in Polish public discourse that Adamowicz had attempted to confront. A staunch defender of migrants and refugees and of LGBT rights, he had marketed Gda\u0144sk as a liberal enclave, a city in open defiance of the xenophobic nationalism promoted by Poland\u2019s rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS), which has governed since 2015. \u201cI am a European so my nature is to be open,\u201d Adamowicz told the Guardian in 2016. \u201cGda\u0144sk is a port and must always be a refuge from the sea.\u201d His liberal stance cast him as a hate figure for government supporters and the far right. In a 2017 publicity stunt, the All-Polish Youth movement published a series of \u201cpolitical death certificates\u201d of pro-European politicians; on Adamowicz\u2019s certificate, they put his \u201ccause of death\u201d as \u201cliberalism, multiculturalism, stupidity\u201d. Observers say he was regularly subjected to personal attacks and abuse on social media and from rightwing media outlets. Some of the attacks continued even after he died. In an interview with a rightwing media outlet broadcast on the day Adamowicz\u2019s death was announced, the far-right politician Grzegorz Braun described him as a \u201ctraitor to the nation\u201d for his political views. \u201cSadly, hatred is becoming more and more visible and more widely accepted in Polish political and social life,\u201d read a joint declaration of Jewish organisations in Poland, published on Tuesday. \u201cThe death of Mayor Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz is yet another tragic warning signal that in our society, ideological differences, and differences of worldview, can lead \u2013 in extreme cases \u2013 to acts of physical violence.\u201d Adamowicz told the Italian newspaper la Repubblica in 2017: \u201cPhysical abuse is normally preceded by verbal violence.

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 16 January.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>Theresa May has sustained the heaviest parliamentary defeat of any British prime minister in the democratic era</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/15/theresa-may-loses-brexit-deal-vote-by-majority-of-230\">after MPs rejected her Brexit deal by a resounding majority of 230</a>, plunging the UK\u2019s exit from the EU into crisis. May made a last-ditch plea to colleagues to support her, warning them not to break their promise to the British people: \u201cTogether we can show the people we serve that their voices have been heard, that their trust was not misplaced.\u201d Earlier in the day, as one Conservative backbencher after another stood up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/15/what-are-you-playing-at-the-commons-brexit-debate-in-quotes\">to slam her painstakingly negotiated withdrawal agreement</a> in the House of Commons, it became clear that few had changed their mind. Speaking just before the vote, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, called the government\u2019s efforts to steer Brexit through parliament \u201cone of the most chaotic and extraordinary parliamentary processes\u201d he had experienced in 35 years as an MP. Moments after the historic defeat, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/15/brexit-vote-parliament-latest-news-may-corbyn-gove-tells-tories-they-can-improve-outcome-if-mays-deal-passed-politics-live?page=with:block-5c3e3817e4b0649df24d23ac#block-5c3e3817e4b0649df24d23ac\">Corbyn tabled a no-confidence motion</a>, which the government has confirmed will be debated and voted upon tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>New South Wales is \u201cwell behind\u201d on developing water-sharing plans </strong>and is operating its rivers on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/16/damning-murray-darling-report-says-nsw-well-behind-on-water-sharing-plans\">old plans that are not accredited</a>, according to a report from the Murray Darling Basin Authority. The NSW primary industries minister, Niall Blair, said on Tuesday that the fish kills in the Darling River were not as a result of over-allocation of water, pointing to the water-sharing plans as proof. The revelation that only eight of NSW\u2019s 20 water-sharing plans are expected to be accredited by the middle of the year put that claim into doubt.</p> <p><strong>Public health experts are bemoaning the lack of evidence-based policy making when it comes to drug use, </strong>following the suspected pill-related deaths of five young people at music festivals since September. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/16/climate-change-for-drugs-experts-decry-evidence-free-policy-as-deaths-mount\">The deaths have left public health experts grappling with the question</a> of whether the substances themselves are becoming more dangerous. \u201cThere are definitely elements about the drug market that have changed in the last decade or two that have made it more hazardous,\u201d the emergency doctor and pill-testing advocate David Caldicott told Guardian Australia.</p> <p><strong>Despite a recording of the incident, Queensland police could find \u201cno evidence\u201d that an officer spoke inappropriately to a domestic violence victim. </strong>The recording of the conversation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/16/queensland-police-find-no-evidence-officer-spoke-inappropriately-to-victim-despite-recording\">was broadcast on national television</a>. Guardian Australia reported in September that the officer told Julie (not her real name) she could find other police to \u201charass\u201d about her \u201cpetty domestic violence matter\u201d. After the Guardian Australia story, South Brisbane police began investigating the allegation that the officer spoke to Julie inappropriately.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 16 January. Top stories Theresa May has sustained the heaviest parliamentary defeat of any British prime minister in the democratic era after MPs rejected her Brexit deal by a resounding majority of 230, plunging the UK\u2019s exit from the EU into crisis. May made a last-ditch plea to colleagues to support her, warning them not to break their promise to the British people: \u201cTogether we can show the people we serve that their voices have been heard, that their trust was not misplaced.\u201d Earlier in the day, as one Conservative backbencher after another stood up to slam her painstakingly negotiated withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons, it became clear that few had changed their mind. Speaking just before the vote, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, called the government\u2019s efforts to steer Brexit through parliament \u201cone of the most chaotic and extraordinary parliamentary processes\u201d he had experienced in 35 years as an MP. Moments after the historic defeat, Corbyn tabled a no-confidence motion, which the government has confirmed will be debated and voted upon tomorrow. New South Wales is \u201cwell behind\u201d on developing water-sharing plans and is operating its rivers on old plans that are not accredited, according to a report from the Murray Darling Basin Authority. The NSW primary industries minister, Niall Blair, said on Tuesday that the fish kills in the Darling River were not as a result of over-allocation of water, pointing to the water-sharing plans as proof. The revelation that only eight of NSW\u2019s 20 water-sharing plans are expected to be accredited by the middle of the year put that claim into doubt. Public health experts are bemoaning the lack of evidence-based policy making when it comes to drug use, following the suspected pill-related deaths of five young people at music festivals since September. The deaths have left public health experts grappling with the question of whether the substances themselves are becoming more dangerous. \u201cThere are definitely elements about the drug market that have changed in the last decade or two that have made it more hazardous,\u201d the emergency doctor and pill-testing advocate David Caldicott told Guardian Australia. Despite a recording of the incident, Queensland police could find \u201cno evidence\u201d that an officer spoke inappropriately to a domestic violence victim. The recording of the conversation was broadcast on national television. Guardian Australia reported in September that the officer told Julie (not her real name) she could find other police to \u201charass\u201d about her \u201cpetty domestic violence matter\u201d. After the Guardian Australia story, South Brisbane police began investigating the allegation that the officer spoke to Julie inappropriately. But Julie was sent a letter earlier this month informing her that \u201cthere is no evidence to support the allegations made\u201d. World Police and anti-terrorist forces in Nairobi have been fighting to regain control of a hotel and office complex after it was seized by gunmen. There are reports that three people have been killed. At least 15 children have died in Syria amid freezing temperatures because of a lack of medical care and inadequate living conditions for displaced people, the UN has said, warning that more deaths are likely to follow. Climate change could be kept in check if a phaseout of all fossil fuel infrastructure were to begin immediately, according to research. It shows that keeping global warming to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is still possible. A small green shoot is growing on the moon after a cotton seed germinated in an \u201cearth chamber\u201d onboard a Chinese lunar lander. The sleepy world of p\u00e9tanque has been rocked by claims that Belgian players are turning to stronger stimulants than shots of pastis and drags of Gitanes cigarettes when bowling on the international stage. Opinion and analysis Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d has become the trademark of his presidency. Build it tall, build it wide \u2013 he has pledged 1,000 miles (1,600km) of it \u2013 and America will be safe again. But how does that uncomplicated notion compare to the complexity of the border itself? Taken as a whole, the 1,954 miles (3,150km) of US-Mexican border is a place of astounding diversity \u2013 of terrain, of land use, of city and countryside, of ethnicity. There is diversity, too, of political view among the 7.5 million people who live in US border counties. Some are ardent backers of Trump\u2019s wall. Others see their future, and the future of America, as being inextricably linked to that of their neighbour to the south. The cast and crew of Sydney\u2019s In The Heights have an enormous night ahead. The local production of Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s pre-Hamilton musical opened in 2018 at the Hayes \u2013 a 110-seat venue. And now, with two brand new male leads, they\u2019ve had only a few months to work out how to upscale to the country\u2019s most prestigious stage. The Concert Hall at the Sydney Opera House seats 2700. But that age-old adage applies: the show must go on. And it opens tonight. Sport Tom Rogic scored deep into injury-time in last night\u2019s Socceroos match, ensuring that the Australian team emerged from a nervy game against Syria with the win, 3-2, they needed to progress from Group B in second place. Here\u2019s the match as it happened. Nick Kyrgios has been guilty of not giving his best several times in his career, but at the Australian Open yesterday, he was simply outplayed by a better player. In the cricket, another Virat Kohli masterclass propelled India to a six-wicket win against Australia to square their limited overs series at one-all. Thinking time: Dapper little birds Guarding the nests of Australia\u2019s hooded plovers is a job for all of us. These \u201cdapper little birds\u201d, in the words of Birdlife Australia\u2019s Sean Dooley, \u201cskitter across the sand of our southern surf beaches. With dainty orange legs that whirr underneath as if they were a child\u2019s wind-up toy, hooded plovers seek out small bugs and tiny sea creatures hidden among the seaweed on the tideline or venture into the wash left by the crashing waves.\u201d But the hooded plovers nest on the beach too, though nest is a relative term. \u201cIt\u2019s more a shallow scrape in the sand with perhaps a sprinkle of seaweed or shells here for disguise.\u201d Birds, dogs and humans pose a threat to the nests on crowded beaches, but a team of volunteers has assembled to monitor nests and erect fences, signs and shelters to shield the seriously adorable chicks from the blazing sun once they have hatched. The program has increased the chances of hooded plovers successfully raising a chick tenfold \u2013 but every beach-goer has a role to play in their survival. Media roundup Bill Shorten has been warned by \u201cLabor legend\u201d Bill Kelty, the former secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and one of the architects of compulsory superannuation, that he must stand up to industry superannuation funds, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Companies with large franking credit balances are likely to pay early dividends to shareholders in anticipation of a Labor government, according to the Australian. The Courier Mail reveals that Queensland farmers are spending up to $40,000 a week trucking water from NSW as a result of the drought. Coming up A 26-year-old man accused of murdering 22-year-old British tourist Grace Millane in New Zealand will make his first appearance in the high court at Auckland today. Students for Sensible Drug Policy will launch their #BeHeardNotHarmed campaign today. It\u2019s the the first national, youth-led campaign in support of pill testing.

Only 526 exception reports were filed at the trust during the three-year data period, the HSJ found. The website also learned that some juniors were being discouraged by their superiors from submitting exception reports because they made their units look inefficient. Dr Andrew Goddard, the president of the Royal College of Physicians, said that should never happen. \u201cException reports are there for a reason \u2013 to protect doctor and patient \u2013 but it is also crucial that we don\u2019t expect ever more of hard-pressed staff, otherwise we will contribute to their burnout and ultimately create a much bigger problem for the NHS.\u201d Danny Mortimer, the chief executive of NHS Employers, said: \u201cAlthough the process is working well overall there are areas where guardians of safe working hours and doctors tell us improvement is needed.\u201d Meanwhile, Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, has warned ministers that the NHS long-term plan cannot be delivered without a huge increase in staff. \u201cI think I can make a relatively confident prediction here today that everything in this plan is not going to be delivered,\u201d he told MPs on the Commons health and social care select committee on Tuesday. \u201cThere is simply too much to do for the money and workforce we have available.\u201d",

Those private polls showed a Brexit win, giving hedge funds an edge over the public, as broadcasters ran comments after the polls closed from prominent Brexiter and the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage suggesting that the remain vote would \u201cedge it\u201d. The Conservative MP and Treasury committee chair, Nicky Morgan, has warned that the sale of private polls to hedge funds during key political events poses risks to the \u201cintegrity of UK financial markets\u201d. The Financial Conduct Authority previously said it would not crack down on hedge funds over the purchase of private polls unless it was used in a way that broke the rules. But its chief executive, Andrew Bailey, told MPs on the Treasury committee on Tuesday that he had given the issue \u201cquite a bit of thought\u201d and is looking at whether the FCA could step in through regulations meant to cover insider dealing and inside information. \u201cI think the market abuse regime bites here,\u201d Bailey said.

The council agreed on Tuesday to investigate whether it can afford to step in to buy Hamilton House, a community and arts centre whose owners have already evicted hundreds of tenants and community users to convert it to housing. With 500 artists, social enterprises and businesses affected by the conversion plans, it is one of the biggest examples of a threat that is faced nationwide by community assets as property prices rise in many towns and cities. The complex is in a former bank office decorated on one side with a mural by the Bristol artist Banksy, and its use as a community arts centre has won the backing of one of the founder members of Massive Attack, Grant Marshall, who has described the housing plans as \u201cabsolutely disgraceful\u201d. The case reached Bristol city council on Tuesday after a petition calling for a council buyout was signed by almost 6,000 people. Gem Burgoyne, a former tenant at the Hamilton House, urged the mayor, Marvin Rees, to \u201cchallenge the paradigm of corporate gentrification\u201d and support the artists and enterprises that have been based at the centre. \u201cThe people of Bristol demonstrate that they want to be active participants within their community,\u201d she said. \u201cA big part of Bristol\u2019s attraction is the independent grassroots culture and creative drive.\u201d Bristol\u2019s deputy mayor, Craig Cheney, said the administration would investigate if the council could afford to cover the borrowing required to buy the facility.

Tory MP Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, on Cox\u2019s opening statement in the debate: Entertaining as it was \u2026 it filled me with a slight sense of gloom to see that the government had got to such a pass that it had to rely on the skills of a criminal defence advocate to get it out of its difficulties. The former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab in the closing hours of the debate: This deal is so demeaning to our country it would inevitably invite \u2013 no, demand \u2013 reversal by the British people from the moment the ink was dry. Ken Clarke, the veteran pro-remain Tory MP: To be fair to my friends who are hardline Brexiteers and always have been, none of them had the slightest intention of taking any notice of the referendum.

      "body": "<p>The headline was enough to make you drop your marmalade: half of young women, and 43% of young men, said that they were not \u201ccompetent\u201d when they lost their virginity,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/15/women-and-men-are-losing-virginity-before-they-are-ready-study\" title=\"\"> in a survey of nearly 3,000 17- to 24-year-olds</a> released this week. If the idea of sexual competence strikes you as inherently droll, Melissa Palmer, who conducted the study as a research fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, helpfully subdivided it into four areas: consent, autonomy, contraceptive use and \u201creadiness\u201d. The study looked only at heterosexual encounters.</p> <p>Consent was measured by a three-option question about willingness: were you and your partner equally willing, were you more willing, were they more willing? This yielded the finding that nearly 20% of women felt less willing than their partner.</p> <p>Autonomy depended on the circumstances of the encounter, which ranged from \u201cI was drunk/under the influence of drugs\u201d and \u201cAll my friends were doing it\u201d to \u201cIt felt like a natural follow-on\u201d and \u201cI was in love\u201d. Palmer notes: \u201cThose questions basically established whether the influencer was external to the self \u2013 peer pressure or alcohol \u2013 or internal to the self, driven by your own feelings.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/15/women-and-men-are-losing-virginity-before-they-are-ready-study\">Many in UK lose virginity before they are ready \u2013 study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Contraceptive use is straightforward, and most young people \u2013 almost 90% \u2013 had used reliable contraception.</p> <p>The question about readiness was: \u201cThinking about the first time you had sex, was it about the right time, do you wish you had waited longer or do you wish you hadn\u2019t waited so long?\u201d Just under 40% of women, and just over a quarter of men, did not feel they\u2019d had sex for the first time at the right time. \u201cVery, very few wished it had been sooner,\u201d Palmer says.</p> <p>Only those respondents who answered positively in all four categories were deemed sexually competent. The report points out that there are implications beyond sexually transmitted infections and teenage pregnancies \u2013 which have been in steady decline for the past 20 years \u2013 for young people\u2019s wellbeing.</p> <p>Does this mean the age of consent is too low? By definition it must be arbitrary, for as long as human beings are different, and mature at different rates, there can be no objective standard for sexual readiness. Self-evidently, though, an age of consent that would result in a pregnancy that would be physically harmful to the mother must be prioritising something other than the woman\u2019s wellbeing. For that reason, I would put 14 as too young, although that\u2019s the age of consent (at least for heterosexuals) in many countries, from Germany and Macedonia to Madagascar and Malawi. In South Korea, it is 13. Eighteen seems pretty stringent, though, and is far more common in Africa than in Europe.In the US, sexual consent laws vary from state to state, tending to put consent at 16 (though sometimes 17 or 18). Many states also have \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d laws, which reduce or eliminate penalties when parties are close in age. </p> <p>Suffice to say, there is no direct correlation between what we would think of as the liberalism of a country and its age of consent, nor between the age of consent and the prevalence of sexual violence and/or gender discord, except at the extreme ends. Countries where the age of consent is \u201cat marriage\u201d tend to have extremely high levels of violence against women and girls, although in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/09/the-rape-capital-of-the-world-we-women-in-democratic-republic-congo-dont-see-it-that-way\" title=\"\">the so-called rape capital of the world</a>, the age of consent is 18 for males and 14 for females.</p> <p>\u201cThe age of consent is a legal issue, which is something that we can\u2019t talk about as public health researchers,\u201d Palmer says. \u201cThe countries that have close-in-age type laws, so they don\u2019t focus on the age of young people but the age difference between partners, seem to take a more nuanced approach.\u201d</p> <p>Historically, the age of consent in Britain was 10 or 12 until the end of the 19th century, but the concept of consent was so different \u2013 women having no sexual agency, marriage being taken as a blanket consent \u2013 that it\u2019s not comparable. The drive in the 1880s towards an age of consent of 16 was politically underpinned by the child labour elements of the factories acts of the previous two decades, which did more of the heavy lifting in terms of differentiating between adults and children than any moral, sexual crusade. And 16 is where the age of consent has stood since, only examined in recent memory as an equality issue when the age of gay consent was brought down from 18 to 16, in 2001.</p> <p>So do these laws make any difference to the lived, regular experience of sex, or is their main use for the purpose of criminalising the exploitation of children? Palmer refers to some evidence \u2013 not from her own study \u2013 that having 16 as a legal age of consent \u201ccan provide a useful safety net, in that people can say, \u2018It\u2019s not legal\u2019, as a way of resisting pressure to have sex.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t always work that way. Paula Hall is a sex therapist, and clinical director of the Laurel Centre. She says: \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of young people say, \u2018Rather than the age of consent, 16 is the deadline.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In tandem with that pressure is the availability of porn. \u201cThat becomes the easier option,\u201d Hall says. \u201cYou can have sexual experience without risk.\u201d But there are things you could never learn from pornography. \u201cThey don\u2019t have minor mishaps in porn. You rarely even see anyone put a condom on, and never the fiddly bit. Certainly in porn you do not see a guy losing his erection putting a condom on \u2013 it\u2019s all so seamless.\u201d</p> <p>Faced with these professional standards, some people are deferring actual sex for longer. \u201cA lot of the guys that I\u2019ve worked with who use porn compulsively are still virgins at 23, 24, 28,\u201d Hall says. \u201cThe longer they\u2019ve gone without a real-time partner, they start making out they\u2019ve got more experience than they have, and they become absolutely terrified of it. They develop porn-induced erectile dysfunction. They worry about living up to the standards they see in pornography; they worry about losing their erection.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of people having sex when they are not autonomous, or not ready, suggests immediately the world of victims and culprits, but that\u2019s not what people describe. \u201cThey\u2019re not necessarily a victim of someone else, but a victim of failure, a victim of their own insufficiency.\u201d</p> <p>Porn also interrupts the development of emotional readiness, if only because it never mentions it. \u201cThere\u2019s a biological readiness, knowing your body is ready,\u201d says Hall. \u201cBut there\u2019s the psychological and the emotional bit as well. It has the potential to be the most wonderful, most amazing, most intimate encounter in the world. But it also has the potential to be really quite soul-destroying. It can make you feel fantastic or it can make you feel like shit, and are you ready to deal with either outcome?\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s an answer that sounds a bit glib, which is: are you ever ready to have a sexual encounter with someone who doesn\u2019t care as much as you do? Is there any age at which that would be OK? And there\u2019s a very 21st-century answer, which is: don\u2019t let anyone do anything until they have hit full resilience, which is probably at about 35. Hall thinks the age of consent is a red herring. \u201cIf we lowered the age of consent to 14 or upped it to 18 or 20, it wouldn\u2019t make the difference we think it would make. What matters is how we talk about sex to young people, and to each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 January 2019. An earlier version said the Republic of Congo, where the age of consent is 18, had been called the \u201crape capital of the world\u201d; this name was actually used in reference to the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the age of consent is 18 for males and 14 for females. It was further amended on 7 February 2019 to correct the age of consent in South Korea from 20 to 13.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The headline was enough to make you drop your marmalade: half of young women, and 43% of young men, said that they were not \u201ccompetent\u201d when they lost their virginity, in a survey of nearly 3,000 17- to 24-year-olds released this week. If the idea of sexual competence strikes you as inherently droll, Melissa Palmer, who conducted the study as a research fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, helpfully subdivided it into four areas: consent, autonomy, contraceptive use and \u201creadiness\u201d. The study looked only at heterosexual encounters. Consent was measured by a three-option question about willingness: were you and your partner equally willing, were you more willing, were they more willing? This yielded the finding that nearly 20% of women felt less willing than their partner. Autonomy depended on the circumstances of the encounter, which ranged from \u201cI was drunk/under the influence of drugs\u201d and \u201cAll my friends were doing it\u201d to \u201cIt felt like a natural follow-on\u201d and \u201cI was in love\u201d. Palmer notes: \u201cThose questions basically established whether the influencer was external to the self \u2013 peer pressure or alcohol \u2013 or internal to the self, driven by your own feelings.\u201d Contraceptive use is straightforward, and most young people \u2013 almost 90% \u2013 had used reliable contraception. The question about readiness was: \u201cThinking about the first time you had sex, was it about the right time, do you wish you had waited longer or do you wish you hadn\u2019t waited so long?\u201d Just under 40% of women, and just over a quarter of men, did not feel they\u2019d had sex for the first time at the right time. \u201cVery, very few wished it had been sooner,\u201d Palmer says. Only those respondents who answered positively in all four categories were deemed sexually competent. The report points out that there are implications beyond sexually transmitted infections and teenage pregnancies \u2013 which have been in steady decline for the past 20 years \u2013 for young people\u2019s wellbeing. Does this mean the age of consent is too low? By definition it must be arbitrary, for as long as human beings are different, and mature at different rates, there can be no objective standard for sexual readiness. Self-evidently, though, an age of consent that would result in a pregnancy that would be physically harmful to the mother must be prioritising something other than the woman\u2019s wellbeing. For that reason, I would put 14 as too young, although that\u2019s the age of consent (at least for heterosexuals) in many countries, from Germany and Macedonia to Madagascar and Malawi. In South Korea, it is 13. Eighteen seems pretty stringent, though, and is far more common in Africa than in Europe.In the US, sexual consent laws vary from state to state, tending to put consent at 16 (though sometimes 17 or 18). Many states also have \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d laws, which reduce or eliminate penalties when parties are close in age. Suffice to say, there is no direct correlation between what we would think of as the liberalism of a country and its age of consent, nor between the age of consent and the prevalence of sexual violence and/or gender discord, except at the extreme ends. Countries where the age of consent is \u201cat marriage\u201d tend to have extremely high levels of violence against women and girls, although in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the so-called rape capital of the world, the age of consent is 18 for males and 14 for females. \u201cThe age of consent is a legal issue, which is something that we can\u2019t talk about as public health researchers,\u201d Palmer says. \u201cThe countries that have close-in-age type laws, so they don\u2019t focus on the age of young people but the age difference between partners, seem to take a more nuanced approach.\u201d Historically, the age of consent in Britain was 10 or 12 until the end of the 19th century, but the concept of consent was so different \u2013 women having no sexual agency, marriage being taken as a blanket consent \u2013 that it\u2019s not comparable. The drive in the 1880s towards an age of consent of 16 was politically underpinned by the child labour elements of the factories acts of the previous two decades, which did more of the heavy lifting in terms of differentiating between adults and children than any moral, sexual crusade. And 16 is where the age of consent has stood since, only examined in recent memory as an equality issue when the age of gay consent was brought down from 18 to 16, in 2001. So do these laws make any difference to the lived, regular experience of sex, or is their main use for the purpose of criminalising the exploitation of children?

      "body": "<p>They say don\u2019t speak ill of the dead, and especially not of dead children. But it seems there is an exception to that rule when the subject is black and poor, and meets a violent death. In fact, certain rightwing commentators claim they are are doing us a special favour by suggesting that victims of violent crime, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/09/murder-leyton-east-london-boy-14-teenager-police\" title=\"\">14-year-old Jaden Moodie</a>, are somewhat \u201cgangsta\u201d. Led by figures such as Rod Liddle, who among other things questioned why Jaden was out \u201cat night\u201d (6.30pm actually) and criticised his \u201cfatuous gangsta moves\u201d, these talking heads believe they are courageously owning the identification of a cultural problem: one about which the progressive voices in our society stay silent, for fear of being called racist or politically incorrect.</p> <p>Of course most violent crime is conducted by white people and the majority of stabbing victims in Britain are white. But as long as any black children are tragically dying on the streets, it is hugely important to debate the causes. The Liddles of this world posit two diagnoses for the problem of black youth violence: absent fathers, and the related claim that the black family is uniquely dysfunctional (and, more nebulously, \u201cblack culture\u201d, which is perceived as flawed and nefarious). Yet in direct contrast to the rightwing commentators who exploit this problem to pursue their poisonous agendas, there are people who have been researching and writing about the \u201cecology\u201d of violence in our cities for decades, making sense of what we are often told is \u201csenseless\u201d. They have found young people living in an \u201calternative cognitive landscape\u201d in which you stab first and ask questions later; where distrust of the authorities and hostile strangers results in people \u2013 and especially young men \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/sites/crimeandjustice.org.uk/files/YP%20knives%20and%20guns.pdf\" title=\"\">arming themselves</a> and acting in aggressive and threatening ways in order to pre-empt attacks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/09/murder-leyton-east-london-boy-14-teenager-police\">Jaden Moodie murder: police find car in hunt for killers of boy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So how did this state of affairs come to pass? It turns out there are many predictors of violent behaviour more relevant than \u201cabsent fathers\u201d: weak social ties, an absence of constructive social activities in which to invest energy, antisocial peers, poor experiences at school, psychological problems, high activity levels and poor eating habits. All these factors relate to poverty, the lack of resources, opportunities, or \u2013 frankly \u2013 any love from the institutions whose job is to protect, stimulate and engage young people.</p> <p>This has not stopped the black community self-blaming in a manner that is itself a symptom of the problems in question. The breakdown of the black family is an important line of inquiry, and anyone seriously interested will encounter a powerful and significant history. The group with the <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/ethnicity-in-the-uk/ethnicity-and-type-of-family-or-household\" title=\"\">highest number of single-parent households</a> in Britain is people of Caribbean heritage, whose ancestors were forcibly prevented from forming strong families by British slavery over generations.

      "bodyText": "They say don\u2019t speak ill of the dead, and especially not of dead children. But it seems there is an exception to that rule when the subject is black and poor, and meets a violent death. In fact, certain rightwing commentators claim they are are doing us a special favour by suggesting that victims of violent crime, such as 14-year-old Jaden Moodie, are somewhat \u201cgangsta\u201d. Led by figures such as Rod Liddle, who among other things questioned why Jaden was out \u201cat night\u201d (6.30pm actually) and criticised his \u201cfatuous gangsta moves\u201d, these talking heads believe they are courageously owning the identification of a cultural problem: one about which the progressive voices in our society stay silent, for fear of being called racist or politically incorrect. Of course most violent crime is conducted by white people and the majority of stabbing victims in Britain are white. But as long as any black children are tragically dying on the streets, it is hugely important to debate the causes. The Liddles of this world posit two diagnoses for the problem of black youth violence: absent fathers, and the related claim that the black family is uniquely dysfunctional (and, more nebulously, \u201cblack culture\u201d, which is perceived as flawed and nefarious). Yet in direct contrast to the rightwing commentators who exploit this problem to pursue their poisonous agendas, there are people who have been researching and writing about the \u201cecology\u201d of violence in our cities for decades, making sense of what we are often told is \u201csenseless\u201d. They have found young people living in an \u201calternative cognitive landscape\u201d in which you stab first and ask questions later; where distrust of the authorities and hostile strangers results in people \u2013 and especially young men \u2013 arming themselves and acting in aggressive and threatening ways in order to pre-empt attacks. So how did this state of affairs come to pass? It turns out there are many predictors of violent behaviour more relevant than \u201cabsent fathers\u201d: weak social ties, an absence of constructive social activities in which to invest energy, antisocial peers, poor experiences at school, psychological problems, high activity levels and poor eating habits. All these factors relate to poverty, the lack of resources, opportunities, or \u2013 frankly \u2013 any love from the institutions whose job is to protect, stimulate and engage young people. This has not stopped the black community self-blaming in a manner that is itself a symptom of the problems in question. The breakdown of the black family is an important line of inquiry, and anyone seriously interested will encounter a powerful and significant history. The group with the highest number of single-parent households in Britain is people of Caribbean heritage, whose ancestors were forcibly prevented from forming strong families by British slavery over generations. This legacy remains a source of pain in the black community, largely unacknowledged by everyone else. In our time, if the state were interested in the wellbeing of black families, I doubt it would be actively trying to deport married black fathers who have been in the country since childhood and are active carers to small children in otherwise stable, two-parent households. Some of these cases have been reported \u2013 such as that of Hilary Ineomo-Marcus, who was taken away from his young family and detained for removal last year before being released. It\u2019s unknown how many cases have not. Many young black people are growing up in a country that they perceive as hostile to their cultural identity and aspirations of progress. Their acts of cultural expression, both here and in all other post-imperial and post-slavery societies, are recognised forms of resistance that have developed in reaction to a mainstream that recognises neither our past nor our future. Incidentally, the universality of these forms of resistance has made black diasporic culture one of the most lucrative capitalist exploits of all time, commoditised through hip-hop, reggae and, yes, drill \u2013 which itself has a transatlantic history \u2013 as well as black fashion and dance.

On Tuesday morning, as hundreds, possibly thousands of Honduran migrants embarked on a punishing and highly politicized march towards \u201cEl Norte\u201d, the United States president launched what promises to be a protracted Twitter war against the caravan and Democratic opponents on whom he blames the ongoing government shutdown. \u201cA big new Caravan is heading up to our Southern Border from Honduras,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cOnly a Wall will work. Only a Wall, or Steel Barrier, will keep our Country safe!\u201d Trump\u2019s tweet echoed recent warnings from Republican allies that migrants were not welcome and should not come. \u201cWe want the word to get out that it is harder to get across the border,\u201d Marco Rubio told Fox. \u201cWhen people start coming back and saying, \u2018We tried to get across but we couldn\u2019t\u2019 \u2026 it\u2019ll discourage them from coming.\u201d In the day\u2019s leading up to the caravan Honduran airwaves have filled with government propaganda adverts striking a similar tone. \u201cHonduran brother \u2013 don\u2019t be fooled!\u201d a narrator warns would-be travellers in one. \u201cJust listen to your brothers who have come back from previous caravans and say it was all lies and pain.\u201d But there was no sign those warnings had been heeded on Tuesday morning as the sun rose over San Pedro Sula and migrants trudged out of this notoriously violent industrial hub towards the Guatemalan border. \u201cLies. Pure falsehoods,\u201d scoffed Leonel L\u00f3pez, an unemployed factory worker who setting off on the 5,000km odyssey alone. \u201cGod will open the doors to the United States for us,\u201d predicted the 24-year-old, who said he was abandoning his country because it offered too few jobs and \u201cso much death\u201d. L\u00f3pez, the bereaved mother-of-seven, also shrugged off Trump\u2019s threats. \u201cHe makes himself out as being tough. But God is tougher and for God nothing is impossible,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cAnd so we move forwards, with sadness in our hearts.\u201d When the last Central American caravan set a course for the US last October Trump painted it as an invading force filled with gangsters and \u201csome very bad people\u201d. But as scores of young families set off from the bus terminal on Tuesday, the caravan appeared to contain more pushchairs than drug pushers. \u201cWe want a future for our son,\u201d said Ram\u00f3n Cruz, 31, a jobless motorbike mechanic, as he pushed his three-year-old son, Joshua, down the hard shoulder, container trucks rattling past. Hanging from the back was a Buzz Lightyear backpack with a carton of juice tucked into its side pocket. \u201cOur dream, like everyone here, is to make it to the United States because here there\u2019s no way to live,\u201d said Cruz\u2019s 22-year-old wife, Ingris, who was wearing a blue and red Superman T-shirt. \u201cThere are so few work opportunities, so much violence. We have to leave our country practically fleeing.\u201d Another family, including a three-month-old baby girl and her 16-year-old mother, said they were literally fleeing for their lives after being forced from their homes in the northern department of Col\u00f3n by gangs of armed gunmen with ties to the military. \u201cThe whole department is virtually at war,\u201d complained the baby\u2019s grandfather, who said he had decided to get his six-member family out on the caravan after his daughter was raped and two of his homes burned down. \u201cI\u2019ll have to ask for political asylum. I can\u2019t go back \u2026 they\u2019ll kill my whole family.\u201d Tears rolled down his teenage daughter\u2019s cheeks as she considered their sudden decision to take flight. \u201cI want a good future for my child. I don\u2019t want her to have the same destiny as her mother,\u201d she said. Dennis Matute, a 43-year-old traveling with his 11-year-old son, said poverty had forced them from the same region, a cocaine trafficking hub on Honduras\u2019s Caribbean coast. \u201cWe are looking for a place where we can see a future for our children,\u201d said the rural worker, a devout Christian who had spent four days fasting before setting off in order to ensure his God\u2019s support. \u201cHere, things just go from bad to worse.\u201d Matute, who had left his wife, Dalila, behind, believing she was not up to the gruelling journey, admitted the trip was \u201ca dramatic adventure\u201d, not least for someone who was leaving Honduras for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit overwhelming because it\u2019s a tough journey \u2013 and there are risks,\u201d he said of the caravan which members expect to last up to a month. \u201cBut \u2026 there\u2019s a [Honduran] expression that goes: \u2018Who wouldn\u2019t give up on a boat to get to know a port? It\u2019s worth risking everything for the sake of a dream\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cWith faith we will manage it. I am going with faith and hope in God.\u201d Like most of the wanderers, Matute, was carrying just one small black backpack containing a single change of clothes for him and his son. An estimated 5,000 people eventually joined last October\u2019s caravan as it snaked northwards through Guatemala and then Mexico towards the US border where many of its members remain in camps and shelters. How many will join the latest expedition remains unclear, as does the exact route it will take. But Bartolo Fuentes, an opposition politician and radio presenter who was accused of organizing the last caravan \u2013 charges he forcefully rejects \u2013 told the Guardian he expected it to be larger than the previous one. Up to 3,000 people had set off from San Pedro Sula between 10pm on Monday and 5am on Tuesday, by bus and on foot, Fuentes claimed. \u201cThere is a humanitarian crisis in Honduras,\u201d the activist said by way of explanation, adding that most of migrants hoped to reach the US where they could find the best-paying work. Fuentes laughed at the idea that Trump\u2019s bluster \u2013 or his Great Wall \u2013 would succeed in halting the daily exodus from his country. \u201cIt is madness for Trump to keep insisting on this wall. This wall won\u2019t stop anyone,\u201d he said as a column of pilgrims filed past him through the hills south of San Pedro Sula and, slowly, towards the southern border. \u201cIt\u2019s a show, it\u2019s a spectacle, it\u2019s propaganda,\u201d Fuentes sneered. \u201cThese migrants aren\u2019t a threat to anybody, not even Donald Trump.\u201d",

The rider was unseated at the start and then trampled on by other runners at Fontwell Park on Monday.</p> \n<p>It was originally reported that he would be fit to ride but will now likely to be out of action until Thursday at the earliest. His agent Dave Roberts said: \u201cRichard is very sore. He\u2019s taking today and Wednesday off, and will be back on Thursday.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson was unshipped at Fontwell from Umndeni, the 1-2 favourite, after getting an accidental bump from a rival as the field set off, which was the start of a sequence of events leading to one of the season\u2019s most unexpected results. My Destiny, at 66-1, held off Carrick Roads, a 40-1 chance, by a nose, resulting in a Tote win payout of \u00a391.70 to a \u00a31 stake and an Exacta dividend of \u00a32,533 for \u00a31, which is not too far short of the \u00a33,119 first prize.</p> \n<p>Johnson reported afterwards that he had \u201cgot a bit of a kick\u201d after being unseated and will miss his mounts on Mighty Meg, Jammin Masters and Hidden Dilemma. Both <strong>Mighty Meg (12.45</strong>) and <strong>Jammin Masters (1.50)</strong> are solid favourites and will still take plenty of beating. Hidden Dilemma goes to post with a solid chance in the 2.20, but Derriana Spirit and <strong>Keep The River (2.20)</strong> offer strong opposition with narrow preference for the latter at the current prices after an improved performance to finish within seven lengths of Kloud Gate last time out.</p> \n<p>At Lingfield, <strong>Shaw\u2019s Cross (2.40)</strong> is an interesting bet in the two-mile handicap hurdle, facing eight opponents but only one \u2013 the favourite, Clayton \u2013 of obvious significance.</p> \n<p>Clayton represents the potent combination of Gary and Josh Moore and also has a win over today\u2019s track and trip to his name earlier in his career but he is now 10 and his very best performances have come on heavy ground. Shaw\u2019s Cross has recent form that makes him a match for the favourite at least and has fewer miles on the clock \u2013 this is just his 10th start over hurdles. He also put up a career-best when second at Wincanton last time and is just 2lb higher today.</p> \n<p><strong>Chivers (2.10)</strong> is another to look out for on the same card, while <strong>Viola Park (4.45)</strong> and <strong>Compas Scoobie (6.45)</strong> both have plenty to recommend them on the Flat at Kempton Park.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"004344e6-32e2-41a7-863f-014cacd9c48a\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Newbury<br></b>1.10 Ar Mest, 1.40 Point Taken, 2.15 Le Precieux (nb), 2.50 Carlos Du Fruitier (nap), 3.20 Legends Gold, 3.50 Alph&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Lingfield Park&nbsp;<br></b>1.20 Debbonair, 1.50 Paradise Boy, 2.25 Kodiline, 3.00 Beleaguerment, 3.30 Attain, 4.00 Brockey Rise&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Plumpton:</b> <br>1.30 Baddesley Knight, 2.00 The Boola Bee, 2.35 Mauna Kea, 3.10 Thomas Crapper, 3.40 Manning Estate, 4.10 Generous Jack</p>\n    <p><b>Kempton Park<br></b>4.30 Cape Greco, 5.00 Target Zone, 5.30 Holy Heart, 6.00 Madrinho, 6.30 Peggy\u2019s Angel, 7.00 Happy Escape, 7.30 Chica De La Noche, 8.00 Ember\u2019s Glow</p>\n    <p><i>Tips by Greg Wood</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "Tom O\u2019Brien, who took the first Grade One race of 2019 when Elixir De Nutz landed the Tolworth Hurdle at Sandown, was banned for seven days by the stewards at Lingfield on Tuesday for failing to weigh in after finishing third in a handicap hurdle on Shaw\u2019s Cross. O\u2019Brien\u2019s mistake meant that each-way backers of Shaw\u2019s Cross, who was backed to start joint-favourite at 9-4 having opened at 11-4 on course, were denied a payout on the place part of their bet. Cougar Kid, an 8-1 chance, was promoted to third. It is unusual for such an experienced rider as O\u2019Brien, who had his first rides in Britain in the 2004-05 season, to make such a basic error, and it prompted criticism on social media from punters who had lost money as a result. O\u2019Brien, who rides regularly for leading trainer Colin Tizzard, will be suspended from 29 January to 4 February, a week which includes Contenders Day at Sandown Park on 2 February. Meanwhile, Richard Johnson, the reigning champion jockey and clear leader in this year\u2019s title race, was forced to give up his rides at Newcastle on Tuesday. The rider was unseated at the start and then trampled on by other runners at Fontwell Park on Monday. It was originally reported that he would be fit to ride but will now likely to be out of action until Thursday at the earliest. His agent Dave Roberts said: \u201cRichard is very sore. He\u2019s taking today and Wednesday off, and will be back on Thursday.\u201d Johnson was unshipped at Fontwell from Umndeni, the 1-2 favourite, after getting an accidental bump from a rival as the field set off, which was the start of a sequence of events leading to one of the season\u2019s most unexpected results. My Destiny, at 66-1, held off Carrick Roads, a 40-1 chance, by a nose, resulting in a Tote win payout of \u00a391.70 to a \u00a31 stake and an Exacta dividend of \u00a32,533 for \u00a31, which is not too far short of the \u00a33,119 first prize. Johnson reported afterwards that he had \u201cgot a bit of a kick\u201d after being unseated and will miss his mounts on Mighty Meg, Jammin Masters and Hidden Dilemma. Both Mighty Meg (12.45) and Jammin Masters (1.50) are solid favourites and will still take plenty of beating. Hidden Dilemma goes to post with a solid chance in the 2.20, but Derriana Spirit and Keep The River (2.20) offer strong opposition with narrow preference for the latter at the current prices after an improved performance to finish within seven lengths of Kloud Gate last time out. At Lingfield, Shaw\u2019s Cross (2.40) is an interesting bet in the two-mile handicap hurdle, facing eight opponents but only one \u2013 the favourite, Clayton \u2013 of obvious significance. Clayton represents the potent combination of Gary and Josh Moore and also has a win over today\u2019s track and trip to his name earlier in his career but he is now 10 and his very best performances have come on heavy ground. Shaw\u2019s Cross has recent form that makes him a match for the favourite at least and has fewer miles on the clock \u2013 this is just his 10th start over hurdles. He also put up a career-best when second at Wincanton last time and is just 2lb higher today. Chivers (2.10) is another to look out for on the same card, while Viola Park (4.45) and Compas Scoobie (6.45) both have plenty to recommend them on the Flat at Kempton Park.",

      "bodyText": "Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s worst fears have been realised after a scan on Harry Kane\u2019s left ankle confirmed he sustained ligament damage during the defeat by Manchester United. The England captain is not expected even to resume training until early March. The striker had hobbled away from Wembley on Sunday after hurting the joint in a challenge with Phil Jones towards the end of the 1-0 loss and, while he had initially conceded he would miss at least a month in rehabilitation, medical tests on the ankle suggest his absence will extend further. The forward was photographed on crutches and wearing a protective boot as he visited a Harley Street clinic in central London to be scanned on Tuesday morning and Tottenham later issued a brief statement confirming the damage. The club are now resigned to being without their talismanic forward in both legs of their Champions League knockout tie against Borussia Dortmund and, should they progress beyond Chelsea, in the Carabao Cup final where Manchester City surely await. The 25-year-old is no stranger to ankle problems having endured time on the sidelines in each of the last three years, missing seven weeks in the autumn of 2016, after suffering injuries on the joint. However, with Spurs 1-0 up from the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final, his absence this time is particularly untimely, and he is likely to miss at least 11 games while he undertakes his rehabilitation. Mauricio Pochettino is already without Son Heung-min \u2013 potentially until the end of the month \u2013 while he plays for South Korea at the Asian Cup, and has ruled out reintroducing Vincent Janssen to the first team. That leaves Lucas Moura, who should return at Fulham on Sunday after knee trouble, and Fernando Llorente \u2013 who has in effect been available for transfer \u2013 as his striker options for the foreseeable future.

It quickly morphed into a vehemently anti-immigrant and in particular anti-Muslim force, fuelled by anger over the decision by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, to allow more than a million refugees into Germany in 2015.</p> <p>Party observers said that while the BfV\u2019s decision might actually encourage some Germans to join the party \u2013 viewing it as another example of a perceived rise in political correctness in the country \u2013 it could put off others wary that they might be breaking the law by supporting it.</p> <p>In 2017, the party entered parliament for the first time and now sits as the main opposition in the Bundestag. It is the most successful party to the right of Merkel\u2019s conservative alliance since the second world war.</p> <p>The BfV now has a right to spy on both the Wing and the JA, including taking a closer look at who its members are and requesting information about them from other organisations and authorities. It is not allowed to bug phones or monitor internet use.</p> <p>H\u00f6cke has been under suspicion for some time, particularly for his links to the alt-right <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/21/katie-hopkins-boat-far-right-activists-sicily-migrants\">Identitarian</a> movement, which is already under surveillance by the BfV for its radical white-nationalist and anti-Islam views.</p> <p>In 2017, he provoked a national row after referring to Berlin\u2019s memorial to the 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis as a \u201cmonument of shame\u201d and called for a\u201c180 degree U-turn in our politics of remembrance\u201d. </p> <p>Since then, party moderates have insisted he should be thrown out, while those on the nationalist right have elevated him to the status of a party hero.</p> <p>Party leaders reacted angrily to the BfV\u2019s statement, saying they would fight it. \u201cWe consider this decision to be wrong,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/10/germanys-afd-leader-alexander-gauland-accused-of-echoing-hitler-in-newspaper-article\">Alexander Gauland</a>, the AfD co-leader. He accused the BfV of pandering to a \u201ccertain societal climate\u201d and called the move a deliberate attempt to damage the AfD\u2019s prospects before elections in the states of Brandenburg, Saxony and Thuringia.</p> <p>His colleague, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/02/far-right-german-politician-pulls-out-of-oxford-union-event\">Alice Weidel</a>, said the declaration showed why the BfV\u2019s previous president, Hans-Georg Maa\u00dfen, who voiced doubts over reports far-right mobs had chased immigrants through the eastern city of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/04/chemnitz-riots-spark-calls-for-afd-to-be-put-under-surveillance-neo-nazi\">Chemnitz</a>, had not stayed in the post. \u201cWith Herr Maa\u00dfen this decision would not have been possible,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Haldenwang said his organisation was closely watching activities of campaigners who sought to attack the AfD, saying that leftwing extremists also faced being placed under observation.</p> <p>Last week, Frank Magnitz, an AfD MP from Bremen, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/08/german-far-right-mp-frank-magnitz-injured-in-politically-motivated-attack\">attacked in the street</a> in what police said was a politically motivated attack.

The BfV said it would also be keeping the party\u2019s youth wing, Young Alternative (JA), under surveillance and would investigate whether the AfD as a whole should be put on its official watchlist, but said it still had insufficient evidence for doing so. Thomas Haldenwang, the agency\u2019s head, said H\u00f6cke\u2019s wing of the party was \u201ca threat to the liberal democratic principles of Germany\u2019s constitution\u201d. He said members of the party\u2019s youth wing had demonstrated they were hostile to migrants and had called for all Muslim men to be subject to a curfew. Haldenwang said H\u00f6cke\u2019s wing, often referred to as \u201cder Fl\u00fcgel\u201d (the Wing), was in contravention of the German constitutional pledge to protect human dignity, as well as the principles of democracy and the state of law. The decision, made after months of deliberation, is a blow to the rightwing populist party, which was founded in 2013 by a Eurosceptic group of academics and economists at the time of the EU\u2019s bailout of Greece. It quickly morphed into a vehemently anti-immigrant and in particular anti-Muslim force, fuelled by anger over the decision by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, to allow more than a million refugees into Germany in 2015. Party observers said that while the BfV\u2019s decision might actually encourage some Germans to join the party \u2013 viewing it as another example of a perceived rise in political correctness in the country \u2013 it could put off others wary that they might be breaking the law by supporting it. In 2017, the party entered parliament for the first time and now sits as the main opposition in the Bundestag. It is the most successful party to the right of Merkel\u2019s conservative alliance since the second world war. The BfV now has a right to spy on both the Wing and the JA, including taking a closer look at who its members are and requesting information about them from other organisations and authorities. It is not allowed to bug phones or monitor internet use. H\u00f6cke has been under suspicion for some time, particularly for his links to the alt-right Identitarian movement, which is already under surveillance by the BfV for its radical white-nationalist and anti-Islam views. In 2017, he provoked a national row after referring to Berlin\u2019s memorial to the 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis as a \u201cmonument of shame\u201d and called for a\u201c180 degree U-turn in our politics of remembrance\u201d. Since then, party moderates have insisted he should be thrown out, while those on the nationalist right have elevated him to the status of a party hero. Party leaders reacted angrily to the BfV\u2019s statement, saying they would fight it. \u201cWe consider this decision to be wrong,\u201d said Alexander Gauland, the AfD co-leader. He accused the BfV of pandering to a \u201ccertain societal climate\u201d and called the move a deliberate attempt to damage the AfD\u2019s prospects before elections in the states of Brandenburg, Saxony and Thuringia. His colleague, Alice Weidel, said the declaration showed why the BfV\u2019s previous president, Hans-Georg Maa\u00dfen, who voiced doubts over reports far-right mobs had chased immigrants through the eastern city of Chemnitz, had not stayed in the post. \u201cWith Herr Maa\u00dfen this decision would not have been possible,\u201d she said. Haldenwang said his organisation was closely watching activities of campaigners who sought to attack the AfD, saying that leftwing extremists also faced being placed under observation. Last week, Frank Magnitz, an AfD MP from Bremen, was attacked in the street in what police said was a politically motivated attack. The party blamed an atmosphere in which it was increasingly being denigrated by its political opponents and the media. H\u00f6cke is due to stand for the party in Thuringia.",

A crossparty group of MEPs commissioned an investigation into claims, revealed by the Guardian, that Germany\u2019s Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) copy-and-pasted tracts from Monsanto studies. The study\u2019s findings have been released hours before a parliamentary vote on tightening independent scrutiny of the pesticides approvals process. The authors said they found \u201cclear evidence of BfR\u2019s deliberate pretence of an independent assessment, whereas in reality the authority was only echoing the industry applicants\u2019 assessment.\u201d Molly Scott Cato, a Green MEP, said the scale of alleged plagiarism by the BfR authors shown by the new paper was \u201cextremely alarming\u201d. \u201cThis helps explain why the World Health Organization assessment on glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen was so at odds with EU assessors, who awarded this toxic pesticide a clean bill of health, brushing off warnings of its dangers,\u201d she said. The study found plagiarism in 50.1% of the chapters assessing published studies on health risks \u2013 including whole paragraphs and entire pages of text. The European Food Safety Authority (Efsa), based its recommendation that glyphosate was safe for public use on the BfR\u2019s assessment.

It found that EPA regulators used unpublished industry reports in 63% of the studies they evaluated, whereas the IARC relied solely on publicly available literature. Almost three-quarters of the peer-reviewed papers looked at by IARC found evidence of genotoxicity in glyphosate, compared with just 1% of the industry analyses, according to the study published in Environmental Sciences Europe.

The damning assessment by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority is contained in the December 2018 progress report posted on its website and comes as NSW faces growing questions over whether its rivers are over-allocated in the wake of a big fish kill at Menindee on the Darling River. Water resource plans, or water-sharing plans, set the detailed rules for sharing water between irrigators and the environment in each catchment. They include rules on how allocations will be made, when irrigators must cease pumping in low flows, pump sizes permitted, and rules for shepherding environmental flows down the river. But NSW has failed to submit even first drafts of 12 of of its 20 required plans, including those for major rivers such as the Barwon Darling, the Lower Darling, the Namoi and the Murrumbidgee. Instead, NSW is operating its rivers under old plans, which have not been accredited. In particular, the 2012 Barwon Darling water-sharing plan has come in for heavy criticism because it allows irrigators to pump during low and medium flows. The revelations of NSW\u2019s slow progress come as as low river flows, hot weather and algal blooms in several rivers have caused massive fish kills. The NSW minister for primary industries, Niall Blair, denied on Tuesday there was a problem of over-allocation in NSW, saying that the primary cause of falling dam levels and low flows was the drought. \u201cWe have water-sharing plans and we are developing and submitting our water resource plans for all across New South Wales to be signed off by Canberra,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a debate about over-allocation. \u201cThis is a drought. For people to jump on the bandwagon now and point the finger at farmers and tell them they are responsible for this \u2013 go and look at the records. But the water-sharing plans Blair was referring to are incomplete and NSW lagging is far behind other states. The MDBA said 12 of NSW\u2019s were only at the \u201cpreliminary phase\u201d in which NSW outlines its approach to the MDBA. The MDBA rated its level of confidence of NSW meeting the deadline at 30% or less. \u201cThe MDBA remains concerned about the large volume of work that needs to be completed,\u201d the report said. \u201cAt this stage MDBA considers that eight of the 20 NSW WRPs are on track for accreditation by mid-2019. While the authority said NSW was co-operating, it said the state still needed to resolve a number of complex policy implementation issues to enable the accreditation of its plans. These included floodplain harvesting, water accounting issues and the protection of environmental water in the northern NSW catchments.",

      "bodyText": "In 2001 the emergency doctor David Caldicott tried and failed to save the life of a man who had taken an ecstasy pill containing the so-called \u201cDr Death\u201d adulterant, para-Methoxyamphetamine. Known as PMA, the substance surfaces only intermittently in Australia. In 2007, for example, 20-year-old Annabel Catt died after taking two MDMA caps at the Good Vibrations festival in Sydney. Later tests showed they contained PMA. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The 2001 death affected Caldicott so much that, 18 years later, he is one of the chief advocates pushing for state governments to allow pill-testing at music festivals. But a string of recent deaths have left Caldicott and other public health experts grappling with the question of whether the substances themselves are becoming more dangerous. \u201cThere are definitely elements about the drug market that have changed in the last decade or two that have made it more hazardous,\u201d Caldicott told Guardian Australia. \u201cIn the early 2000s we were concerned about maybe a dozen to 20 products, PMA among them. I was at a conference in Vienna two years ago where they were talking about the 750th new drug. The market has exploded, and the turnaround of new products is such that even major drug geeks like me find it hard to keep track of. \u201cTen years ago the cycle for new products was in years, now there is something new that irritates and scares me probably on a fortnightly basis, at least globally. And such is the nature of the market that if it\u2019s in the Czech Republic in October it\u2019ll be here by Christmas.\u201d Since the middle of September, five people have died from suspected drug overdoses at music festivals in New South Wales. Alex Ross-King, 19, became the latest after she was transported from the Fomo festival at Parramatta Park to Westmead hospital on Saturday night. It followed the deaths of Joseph Pham, 23, and Diana Nguyen, 21, who attended the Defqon.1 festival in Penrith on 15 September. Nineteen-year-old Callum Brosnan died at the Knockout Games of Destiny at Sydney Olympic Park on 8 December and Josh Tam, 22, at the Lost Paradise festival on the central coast on 29 December. There\u2019s no evidence PMA was linked to any of the deaths but experts say that\u2019s part of the problem. \u201cNo one would know what\u2019s in these pills,\u201d said Dr Alex Wodak, the president of the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a potluck. Some might be dying from high doses of MDMA, some might be dying from contamination in the MDMA. \u201cNobody monitors what\u2019s available and there is no way of monitoring it. We\u2019re dealing with a black market, and one of the consequences of that is we don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on.\u201d A small step to rectifying that information gap was made on Tuesday, when the NSW coroner\u2019s office announced it would conduct hearings into the five recent music festival deaths. Slated for next week, the directions hearing could pave the way for an inquest to examine how similar deaths can be prevented. But the factors that contribute to drug deaths at festivals are many and complicated. Prof Alison Ritter, a public health academic from the University of New South Wales, said evidence showed \u201cintensive policing\u201d at music festivals could also contribute to the risk of drug-related deaths. In 2006, for example, a NSW ombudsman report into the use of sniffer dogs found they could lead users to engage in \u201cmore risky and dangerous drug-taking practices in order to avoid detection\u201d. Ritter told Guardian Australia: \u201cIn NSW sniffer dogs actually have the potential to cause harm, because what tends to happen is that when people see the dogs, they consume the drugs before entering.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what happened in 2013, when 23-year-old James Munro died at Defqon.1. While waiting in line to enter the festival Munro ingested three pills he believed to be ecstasy while waiting in line because of the police presence at the gate. \u201cHe had some ecstasy tablets with him [and he] decided to take them before entering Defqon,\u201d his father Stephen told the ABC in 2013. \u201cThere was a police presence at the gates and a concern he would be detected.\u201d Ritter also pointed to research from a 2016 pill-testing pilot in the UK, which showed that intensive policing led to festival-goers purchasing drugs on site, where they were nearly twice as likely to be found to be dangerous. The study, by Fiona Measham from the University of Durham, found intensive policing combined with on-site dealing \u201ccould significantly increase drug-related harm\u201d. Ritter agreed with Caldicott that there had been an \u201cexplosion\u201d in new types of substances with the potential to increase the risk of drug use. Chemistry capabilities once reserved for large pharmaceutical companies are now widely accessible, and the internet has made access to a wider variety of products simpler. \u201cThe whole dynamic of the drug market has changed,\u201d Ritter said. \u201cThere are more substances, more dangerous substances, and easier access through the internet. It\u2019s certainly a more risky environment.\u201d The most obvious solution, according to experts who spoke to Guardian Australia, is pill-testing. Both the NSW and Victorian governments remain resistant to introducing pill testing. This week the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said pill testing could give people at festivals \u201ca false sense of security\u201d, and advised young people not to do drugs. \u201cWe are concerned by the unintended consequences of pill-testing,\u201d she told Nine\u2019s Today Show on Monday. The premier said young people needed to be better educated and told it was OK to seek medical attention if something was wrong. \u201cThe message to young people is do not take these tablets.\u201d Caldicott led Australia\u2019s first ever pill-testing trial at the Groovin\u2019 the Moo festival in Canberra last year. A total of 85 substances were tested. One pill returned traces of the highly toxic chemical N-Ethylpentylone, responsible for a number of overdoses around the world. Caldicott sayd Australia has entered \u201can evidence-free zone\u201d on drug policy. \u201cThis issue of pill-testing is climate change for drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cYoung people understand climate change and they understand the consequences. So when politicians wave coal in parliament, young people think they\u2019re knobs. \u201cSimilarly when young people hear politicians talk about drugs in a way they don\u2019t think is reasonable, they\u2019re less likely to listen. In the last 20 years in Australia all nuance associated with drug policy has left the field, so the only message that\u2019s palatable and acceptable is don\u2019t use drugs. \u201cThat\u2019s just not an acceptable message to someone at a hardcore festival who has drugs in their possession and has every intention of taking them.

A PA blares in front of the surf club, which is going through a major reconstruction. A throng of spectators mill about the tired runners. There are even food trucks. Local MP and Victorian minister for police, Lisa Neville, is there to hand out prizes and hold a press conference to open an observation tower on what she says is Victoria\u2019s most heavily visited beach.

With dainty orange legs that whirr underneath as if they were a child\u2019s wind-up toy, hooded plovers seek out small bugs and tiny sea creatures hidden among the seaweed on the tideline left by the surf, or venture into the wash left by the crashing waves.</p> <p>They nest on the beaches too, though nest is a relative term. It\u2019s more a shallow scrape in the sand with perhaps a sprinkle of seaweed or shells here for disguise. It\u2019s a hazardous \u2013 and to us seemingly ridiculous \u2013 nesting strategy, exposed to the elements, tidal surges and passing predators. The parent birds place their faith in the ability of the eggs and chicks to blend in to their surrounds, and head off in the other direction, often pretending to be injured in an attempt to distract nest raiders away.</p> <p>On a hot summer\u2019s day, the parent birds wet their feathers in the water and scurry back to sit on their eggs to cool them down. If we are sitting on a towel near the nest, or just walking too close, they won\u2019t approach, and the eggs will bake. That\u2019s if they\u2019re not discovered by a gull, a raven or a wandering dog first. To be honest, it\u2019s a surprise that any hooded plovers have survived on our crowded beaches at all.</p> <p>But it\u2019s a bird with many friends.</p> <p>Local volunteers got up early to stand guard over one of the hooded plover nests at the starting line of the Rip to River at Point Lonsdale. Their presence ensured the runners stayed down on the hard sand of the waveline to avoid spooking the incubating birds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d76660fe8bcf64d5a9f722633208c8a5c82a34d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d76660fe8bcf64d5a9f722633208c8a5c82a34d1/0_0_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volunteers keep runners away from the plover nests.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volunteers keep runners away from the plover nests.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Dooley/BirdLife Australia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They are part of a wider volunteer network that station themselves on beaches from South Australia to New South Wales, working with BirdLife Australia researchers to monitor nests and erect fences, signs and shelters to shield the seriously adorable chicks from the blazing sun once they have hatched.

BirdLife\u2019s recent analysis confirms that on managed beaches with an active volunteer presence, the likelihood of hooded plovers successfully raising a chick has increased tenfold.</p> <p>The run too goes off without a hitch. The incubating plovers barely raise their heads as the runners stream past. The volunteers cheer the runners on and are greeted with warm waves from the mob on the tideline.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/17/swift-parrots-vs-the-golf-course-who-will-win\">Swift parrots v the golf course.

But is there a down side to this passion, especially for the animals that call the beach their home? The Rip to River Classic is one of the oldest fun runs in Australia, held along the beach between Point Lonsdale and Ocean Grove in Victoria after Christmas for the past 39 years. Hundreds of people choose to shake off festive season hangovers and run 10km of ocean beach to raise funds for the Ocean Grove Surf Lifesaving Club. The scene at the finish line is chaotically festive. A PA blares in front of the surf club, which is going through a major reconstruction. A throng of spectators mill about the tired runners. There are even food trucks. Local MP and Victorian minister for police, Lisa Neville, is there to hand out prizes and hold a press conference to open an observation tower on what she says is Victoria\u2019s most heavily visited beach. Her announcement is overshadowed by questions from the media contingent about violence on city beaches. But the beach can be a harsh place for other reasons too. Take hooded plovers \u2013 dapper little birds that skitter across the sand of our southern surf beaches. With dainty orange legs that whirr underneath as if they were a child\u2019s wind-up toy, hooded plovers seek out small bugs and tiny sea creatures hidden among the seaweed on the tideline left by the surf, or venture into the wash left by the crashing waves. They nest on the beaches too, though nest is a relative term. It\u2019s more a shallow scrape in the sand with perhaps a sprinkle of seaweed or shells here for disguise. It\u2019s a hazardous \u2013 and to us seemingly ridiculous \u2013 nesting strategy, exposed to the elements, tidal surges and passing predators. The parent birds place their faith in the ability of the eggs and chicks to blend in to their surrounds, and head off in the other direction, often pretending to be injured in an attempt to distract nest raiders away. On a hot summer\u2019s day, the parent birds wet their feathers in the water and scurry back to sit on their eggs to cool them down. If we are sitting on a towel near the nest, or just walking too close, they won\u2019t approach, and the eggs will bake. That\u2019s if they\u2019re not discovered by a gull, a raven or a wandering dog first. To be honest, it\u2019s a surprise that any hooded plovers have survived on our crowded beaches at all. But it\u2019s a bird with many friends. Local volunteers got up early to stand guard over one of the hooded plover nests at the starting line of the Rip to River at Point Lonsdale. Their presence ensured the runners stayed down on the hard sand of the waveline to avoid spooking the incubating birds. They are part of a wider volunteer network that station themselves on beaches from South Australia to New South Wales, working with BirdLife Australia researchers to monitor nests and erect fences, signs and shelters to shield the seriously adorable chicks from the blazing sun once they have hatched. They also educate beachgoers about the plovers, which for all their cuteness, are so unobtrusive they usually go unnoticed. The program is meeting with great success. BirdLife\u2019s recent analysis confirms that on managed beaches with an active volunteer presence, the likelihood of hooded plovers successfully raising a chick has increased tenfold. The run too goes off without a hitch. The incubating plovers barely raise their heads as the runners stream past. The volunteers cheer the runners on and are greeted with warm waves from the mob on the tideline. It has been 10 years since the surf club began working with the volunteers to ensure the run itself now poses no threat to the birds. However, other more random events continue to take a toll. In the brief time I was with the volunteers, two unleashed dogs bounded through the middle of the nesting territory. And then there is the disturbed individual who has been systematically vandalising signs, fences and equipment on the local beaches. Further along the coast near Warrnambool, it is racing of another kind that is threatening one of the richest stretches of coastline for hooded plovers in Victoria. While Neville is a long-time supporter of her local community\u2019s efforts to rally around the plovers, the Andrews government has just allowed an alteration to planning rules to allow commercial trainers to exercise up to 160 racehorses on those key hooded plover beaches. The hooded plover is a resilient bird \u2013 most pairs will attempt to rebuild after each nest failure. The volunteers who guard over them are likewise tenacious and unstinting in their efforts to ensure our love of the beach extends to the plucky little birds that need it even more than we do.

      "body": "<p>Changes to the disability benefits system that has caused huge hardship to some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable people has cost the government more than \u00a34bn more in extra welfare payments than ministers estimated.</p> <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/30/hammond-no-longer-on-track-to-balance-budget-says-obr\">the Treasury\u2019s independent forecasting unit</a>, said predictions by the Department for Work and Pensions dramatically under-estimated the costs of rolling out the personal independent payments (PIP) system, which began to replace disability living allowance (DLA) in 2013.</p> <p>A saving of \u00a32bn was expected by 2018, but that has since been revised to an over-spend by \u00a31.5bn to \u00a32bn, leaving an estimated \u00a34.2bn gap in the public finances.</p> <p>The figures are expected to bolster calls by disability groups for an overhaul of the PIP system, which has been described as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2017/nov/23/government-waging-war-against-disabled-people\">\u201cvicious attack\u201d on disabled people</a>. MPs on the work and pensions select committee concluded an investigation last year that found the assessments of claimants by private sector contractors to be \u201cshoddy and error strewn\u201d, leading to hundreds of thousands of successful appeals.</p> <p>One charity, Parkinson\u2019s UK, complained that about a quarter of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/10/stop-pip-reassessments-for-patients-with-progressive-diseases-campaigners-say\">people living with the disease in Britain</a> had lost some or all of their support after benefit reassessments, only to have the payments reinstated on appeal.</p> <p>The OBR said the growing number of appeals was one of several causes of the unexpected rise in costs. It said the system had also come under pressure from legal challenges, which had altered the scope of the scheme, and an increase in claimants, especially of working age adults when this group was due to see a large fall.</p> <p>The OBR said: \u201cThe government assumed initially that PIP would be rolled out by 2015-16 and that it would cost 20% less than DLA would have done. In fact, by 2017-18 it was costing around 15 to 20% more, with rollout only around two-thirds complete.\u201d</p> <p>Ministers claimed, when the system was launched, that a programme of rolling medical assessments by three private sector contractors would ensure payments were only made for as long as a claimant needed them.</p> <p>Critical of the system run by public sector staff, the DWP expected that independent medical reassessments would lead to a dramatic fall in the number of people staying on benefits.</p> <p>A report in 2016 by the OBR described the PIP system as \u201ca failure\u201d after it reduced the forecasts of cost savings to 5%. In its latest report it said the inability to achieve savings, which were now nearer -20%, had pushed its forecasting of the welfare budget significantly off track.</p> <p>Frank Field, who chairs the Commons work and pensions committee, said: \u201cDWP told us PIP would save taxpayers money and introduce a fair, transparent assessment process. Today\u2019s report lays bare that it has achieved neither. PIP will cost a fifth more than the system it replaces: a sorry situation largely thanks to DWP\u2019s failure to cost the reform accurately before bringing it in.</p> <p>\u201cFar worse, though, is that the PIP assessments are riddled with repeated and serious errors and have caused untold anxiety and misery for far too many of the people who rely on the benefit to live. The cost of those mistakes is also knocked forward into the tribunal system, not back to the contractors who made them.\u201d</p> <p>The government said: \u201cOur priority has always been to ensure disabled people get the support they\u2019re entitled to.</p> <p>\u201cPIP is designed to focus support on people with the greatest needs and that\u2019s happening, with 31% of people getting the highest level of support, compared to 15% under DLA.</p> <p>\u201cAs with any major new benefit we have been flexible and adapted our approach, and we continue to make improvements to ensure PIP is working in the best way possible.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the DWP defended the scheme, saying it had been extended since its launch.</p> <p>\u201cPIP is designed to focus support on people with the greatest needs and that\u2019s happening, with 31% of people getting the highest level of support, compared to 15% under DLA,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cAs with any major new benefit we have been flexible and adapted our approach, and we continue to make improvements to ensure PIP is working in the best way possible.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Changes to the disability benefits system that has caused huge hardship to some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable people has cost the government more than \u00a34bn more in extra welfare payments than ministers estimated. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the Treasury\u2019s independent forecasting unit, said predictions by the Department for Work and Pensions dramatically under-estimated the costs of rolling out the personal independent payments (PIP) system, which began to replace disability living allowance (DLA) in 2013. A saving of \u00a32bn was expected by 2018, but that has since been revised to an over-spend by \u00a31.5bn to \u00a32bn, leaving an estimated \u00a34.2bn gap in the public finances. The figures are expected to bolster calls by disability groups for an overhaul of the PIP system, which has been described as a \u201cvicious attack\u201d on disabled people. MPs on the work and pensions select committee concluded an investigation last year that found the assessments of claimants by private sector contractors to be \u201cshoddy and error strewn\u201d, leading to hundreds of thousands of successful appeals. One charity, Parkinson\u2019s UK, complained that about a quarter of people living with the disease in Britain had lost some or all of their support after benefit reassessments, only to have the payments reinstated on appeal. The OBR said the growing number of appeals was one of several causes of the unexpected rise in costs. It said the system had also come under pressure from legal challenges, which had altered the scope of the scheme, and an increase in claimants, especially of working age adults when this group was due to see a large fall. The OBR said: \u201cThe government assumed initially that PIP would be rolled out by 2015-16 and that it would cost 20% less than DLA would have done. In fact, by 2017-18 it was costing around 15 to 20% more, with rollout only around two-thirds complete.\u201d Ministers claimed, when the system was launched, that a programme of rolling medical assessments by three private sector contractors would ensure payments were only made for as long as a claimant needed them. Critical of the system run by public sector staff, the DWP expected that independent medical reassessments would lead to a dramatic fall in the number of people staying on benefits. A report in 2016 by the OBR described the PIP system as \u201ca failure\u201d after it reduced the forecasts of cost savings to 5%. In its latest report it said the inability to achieve savings, which were now nearer -20%, had pushed its forecasting of the welfare budget significantly off track. Frank Field, who chairs the Commons work and pensions committee, said: \u201cDWP told us PIP would save taxpayers money and introduce a fair, transparent assessment process. Today\u2019s report lays bare that it has achieved neither. PIP will cost a fifth more than the system it replaces: a sorry situation largely thanks to DWP\u2019s failure to cost the reform accurately before bringing it in. \u201cFar worse, though, is that the PIP assessments are riddled with repeated and serious errors and have caused untold anxiety and misery for far too many of the people who rely on the benefit to live. The cost of those mistakes is also knocked forward into the tribunal system, not back to the contractors who made them.\u201d The government said: \u201cOur priority has always been to ensure disabled people get the support they\u2019re entitled to. \u201cPIP is designed to focus support on people with the greatest needs and that\u2019s happening, with 31% of people getting the highest level of support, compared to 15% under DLA. \u201cAs with any major new benefit we have been flexible and adapted our approach, and we continue to make improvements to ensure PIP is working in the best way possible.\u201d A spokeswoman for the DWP defended the scheme, saying it had been extended since its launch. \u201cPIP is designed to focus support on people with the greatest needs and that\u2019s happening, with 31% of people getting the highest level of support, compared to 15% under DLA,\u201d she said. \u201cAs with any major new benefit we have been flexible and adapted our approach, and we continue to make improvements to ensure PIP is working in the best way possible.\u201d",

Did she tell Nicola Sturgeon of her suspicions too? Or are we really to believe that Ms Sturgeon\u2019s own chief of staff kept this from her?\u201d Carlaw said. \u201cThis scandal cannot be swept under the carpet. Parliament must, and now will, get the chance to probe this matter fully, learn lessons and ensure it can never happen again.\u201d Lloyd and Sturgeon\u2019s private secretary, John Somers, a career civil servant, had been due to give evidence in court on the Salmond inquiry, until the government conceded last week that its inquiry was unlawful and tainted by the appearance of bias. Questioned about the latest allegations, Sturgeon\u2019s spokesman did not challenge Aberdein\u2019s account. He could not give a clear answer on whether or not Lloyd\u2019s alleged actions would be included in the ministerial code investigation into Sturgeon, saying that its remit had not yet been agreed. The ministerial code does not cover special advisers such as Lloyd, but the spokesman suggested that could happen instead of Lloyd being investigated separately under the Scottish government\u2019s code of conduct for special advisers. That document states that special advisers must \u201cnot disclose official information which has been communicated in confidence in government or received in confidence from others\u201d. Advisers are also subject to the civil service rules that state they cannot use \u201cinformation acquired in the course of your official duties to further your private interests or those of others\u201d. Asked about Aberdein\u2019s allegations about Lloyd\u2019s role, Sturgeon\u2019s spokesman accused Salmond\u2019s team of orchestrating a \u201cvendetta\u201d against her but said she would be happy to cooperate with the ministerial code inquiry. \u201cI\u2019m making the point that quite clearly there\u2019s an agenda at play here in terms of Liz\u2019s involvement,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThat has been made abundantly clear by what has been briefed by the other side.\u201d",

While it is easy to imagine the Arsenal keeper trying somebody\u2019s nerves by complimenting them excessively on their Downward Facing Dog, repeatedly offering them drinks from his water bottle or accidentally treading on their velvet slings, the prospect of actually coming to blows with one of football\u2019s nicest men in any environment seems so implausible as to be utterly beyond the realms of possibility. Google \u201cPetr Cech\u201d and \u201ccontroversy\u201d and one of very few occasions in which the 36-year-old appears to have lost his cool in a senior career spanning almost 20 years was when he cut loose at the end of a game and gave referee Mike Dean both barrels.

      "bodyText": "CECH-OUT Unlike say, a certain couple of Fulham players, it is difficult to imagine Petr Cech ever clashing with a teammate during a yoga class. While it is easy to imagine the Arsenal keeper trying somebody\u2019s nerves by complimenting them excessively on their Downward Facing Dog, repeatedly offering them drinks from his water bottle or accidentally treading on their velvet slings, the prospect of actually coming to blows with one of football\u2019s nicest men in any environment seems so implausible as to be utterly beyond the realms of possibility. Google \u201cPetr Cech\u201d and \u201ccontroversy\u201d and one of very few occasions in which the 36-year-old appears to have lost his cool in a senior career spanning almost 20 years was when he cut loose at the end of a game and gave referee Mike Dean both barrels. Which doesn\u2019t really count because it was referee Mike Dean, a fabled attention-seeker who probably deserved both barrels. On Tuesday, while everyone else was taking to Social Media Disgrace Twitter to rage about Donald Trump\u2019s mass order of \u201chamberders\u201d, the meaningless meaningful Brexit vote and \u201clazy juorno bais\u201d, Cech posted a tweet announcing his imminent retirement. \u201cThis is my 20th season as a professional player and it has been 20 years since I signed my first professional contract, so it feels like the right time to announce that I will retire at the end of this season,\u201d said the player who won 14 major trophies, kept a record 202 Premier League clean sheets and is a four-times Premier League Golden Glove winner. \u201cHaving played 15 years in the Premier League and won every single trophy possible, I feel like I have achieved everything I set out to achieve.\u201d And then, the obligatory gag, because he\u2019s also a funny guy. \u201cI will continue to work hard at Arsenal to hopefully win one more trophy this season,\u201d he honked, before announcing he was looking forward to seeing what life holds for him off the pitch. Immediate canonisation and a place in heaven, it seems, so overwhelmingly positive and gushing were the responses to Cech\u2019s big news. A man who would apparently spend his every waking hour helping old ladies across the street whether they wanted to get to the other side or not, it seems Cech never knowingly refused a request for an autograph, selfie or interview when he was not busy keeping the ball from passing him while in goal for Chelsea or Arsenal. In fact, such was his patience he once let legendary Big Paper snapper Tom Jenkins convince him to pose for a photograph on a giant chessboard. For that alone, all at Fiver Towers will miss you \u2026 Cech, mate. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Simon Burnton from 7.45pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Blackeye Rovers 1-2 Newcastle United. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cYou can take my ball away, you can take my bib away, you can take my boots away but you can\u2019t take away my passion\u201d \u2013 Suzanne Wrack speaks to Solihull Moors Ladies\u2019 manager, Annie Zaidi, about her journey into coaching. PHONE PAS OF THE DAY 8 October 2013: \u201cFor anyone who contacts our manager Alan Dowson \u2013 please text him your phone numbers as his phone broke and he\u2019s lost his address book\u201d \u2013 Kingstonian FC send out a tweet to help their manager trace his many lost contacts. 15 January 2019: \u201cWoking FC\u2019s manager has requested that anyone who has his mobile number to send him a text message as he has lost his phone contacts. He had over 2,000 contacts, and says it\u2019s the quietest day he\u2019s had since becoming manager\u201d \u2013 Alan Dowson still hasn\u2019t learned to back up his phone \u2026 and in January too! RECOMMENDED LOOKING It\u2019s a belter from David Squires, featuring espionage, Neil Warnock and merky b@ntz. SUPPORT THE GUARDIAN Producing the Guardian\u2019s thoughtful, in-depth journalism [the stuff not normally found in this email, obviously \u2013 Fiver Ed] is expensive, but supporting us isn\u2019t.

In return we can hopefully arm you with the kind of knowledge that makes you sound slightly less uninformed during those hot reactive gegenpress chats you so enjoy. And if you think what we do is enjoyable [again, etc and so on \u2013 Fiver Ed], please help us keep coming back here to give you more of the same. FIVER LETTERS \u201cRe: yesterday\u2019s Fiver. Dear Neil Warnock, if you believe Great Britain and (presumably) its football leagues would be better off without the rest of the world, I have a big, beautiful wall across northern Mexico to sell you\u201d \u2013 Mike Hartman. \u201cAt least he\u2019s consistent. Like many pedants, I searched for Neil Warnock\u2019s name in proximity to Big Cup or Big Vase. Nary a hit in reference to any club that he\u2019s managed. I guess he really doesn\u2019t want to be in Europe at all\u201d \u2013 Mike Wilner. \u201cThey say you learn something new every day. Well today I have learned two things from The Fiver, having had to google both \u2018perfidies\u2019 and \u2018Sisyphean\u2019 from your collective wordage. Before anyone gets excited, it should be noted that both words appeared in readers\u2019 letters\u201d \u2013 Simon Toms. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Mike Wilner. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS David Wagner has written an open letter to Huddersfield fans after leaving the club by mutual consent. \u201cI want to say thank you \u2026 we all now consider ourselves true Huddersfield folk,\u201d he sobbed. \u201cTogether, we have achieved unbelievable things.\u201d Chelsea face the partial closure of Stamford Bridge in Big Vase after Uefa opened disciplinary proceedings into allegations of racist chanting during last month\u2019s draw at Vidi. Police in Belfast are looking into allegations Norn Iron forward Gavin Whyte was filmed performing a lewd act on himself in public. \u201cGavin\u2019s actions in the video fall far below the standards we expect from a Northern Ireland international,\u201d sniffed national team boss Michael O\u2019Neill. Trent Alexander-Arnold has been ruled out for a month with knee-knack. It\u2019s a good job Liverpool didn\u2019t loan out their only other fit right-back to Bournemouth. Oh! Martin O\u2019Neill has been confirmed as Nottingham Forest manager but players have been left quaking in their boots as they await news of whether Roy Keane will join him or not. Spurs fear Harry Kane may be missing for a month with ankle-knack suffered against Manchester United. Mr Roy is set to solve Crystal Palace\u2019s goalkeeper crisis by signing hot young thing Lucas Perri from S\u00e3o Paulo on loan. The Nasty Leeds spying latest. Tom Rogic scored deep into added-time to ensure Australia emerged from a nervy game against Syria with the flamin\u2019 3-2 win they needed to progress from Group B. And Boreham Wood FC have issued a 1,465-word statement on their club website, urging \u201cMP\u2019s [sic] do your duty\u201d in regards to Tuesday night\u2019s big Brexit vote. STILL WANT MORE? \u201cI don\u2019t use drugs but football is my drug.\u201d Sven gets his chat on with John Duerden about managing the Philippines, his one regret and why his grey hair would stop him getting another gig in England. David Wagner can hold his head high after his Huddersfield love affair, coos Barry Glendenning. Deals! Deals! Deals! The latest movers and shakers in our shiny January transfer interactive.

      "body": "<p>The last time I met Michael Atiyah, who has died aged 89, was at Tate Modern in London; not the most likely place to run into probably Britain\u2019s greatest mathematician since Isaac Newton, but entirely consistent with his wide-ranging enthusiasm for his subject. It was June 2012, and I joined him and the flamboyant French mathematician <a href=\"https://cedricvillani.org/for-mathematicians/\" title=\"\">C\u00e9dric Villani</a> in a panel discussion: Mathematics, a Beautiful Elsewhere. The title says it all.</p> <p>We have sulphuric acid to thank for Atiyah\u2019s decision to become a mathematician. Early in 1940, as Britain and France fought over his homeland of Lebanon, his parents sent him to Victoria college in Cairo. In a 1984 interview he said that while there he got very interested in chemistry, but eventually decided that making \u201csulphuric acid and all that sort of stuff\u201d was not for him: \u201cLists of facts, just facts ...\u201d From that time on, mathematics became his passion. \u201cI never seriously considered doing anything else.\u201d Atiyah\u2019s work was to have a profound influence on today\u2019s mathematics.</p> <p>Atiyah was a geometer, in the sense of visual thinking allied to abstract symbolism, a new attitude that swept through mathematics in the middle of the 20th century. You thought about it like geometry but wrote about it like algebra, and very esoteric algebra at that. His research divides into four main periods, to some extent overlapping \u2013 in the 1950s, algebraic geometry; in the 60s and early 70s, K-theory; the 60s to 80s, index theory; and the late 70s to mid-80s, gauge theory, where his ideas became extremely influential in quantum physics.</p> <p>Algebraic geometry originally developed from a deep link between geometry and algebra promoted in the 1600s by Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Start with Euclid\u2019s plane and introduce coordinates \u2013 pairs of numbers describing the location of a point, much as latitude and longitude determine a point on the Earth\u2019s surface. Geometric properties of curves can then be described by algebraic equations, so questions in geometry can be tackled using algebra, and vice versa.</p> <p>In the late 1800s and early 1900s, a new kid appeared on the mathematical block: topology, in which geometrical shapes can be deformed as if made of elastic. Classical features such as lengths and angles lose their meaning, and are replaced by concepts such as being connected, knotted, or having a hole like a doughnut.</p> <p>Topology turned out to be fundamental to many areas of mathematics. Techniques were devised to associate with a topological space various \u201cinvariants\u201d, which reveal when spaces can or cannot be deformed into each other.</p> <p>One of the most powerful invariants, homology, was established by <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/emmy-noether-theorem-legacy-physics-math\" title=\"\">Emmy Noether</a>, the greatest female mathematician of the late 1800s and early 1900s. She reinterpreted, in terms of abstract algebra, rudimentary methods for counting features such as the number of holes in a surface.</p> <p>In effect, Noether explained that as well as counting holes and associated structures, we can ask how they combine, and extract topological information from the answer.</p> <p>Atiyah began his research career in algebraic geometry, but under the influence of his supervisor, William Hodge, at Cambridge, he quickly moved into an adjacent field, differential geometry, which studies concepts such as curvature \u2014 how a space deviates from the flat plane of Euclid. There he made big advances in the interactions between algebraic geometry, differential geometry and topology.</p> <p>Euclid\u2019s investigations of a circle includes its tangents: straight lines that touch it at one point, like a road supporting a bicycle wheel. Similarly, a sphere has a family of tangent planes, one for each point on its surface. A general family of this kind is called a vector bundle: \u201cbundle\u201d because the sphere ties all the planes together, and \u201cvector\u201d because higher-dimensional analogues of lines and planes are called vector spaces.</p> <p>The topology of a vector bundle provides information about the underlying space. The tangents to a circle, for example, form a cylinder. As proof: rotate each tangent line through a right angle, out of the plane of the circle, and you get a cylinder. There is another vector bundle associated with a circle, in which the lines are twisted to form the famous M\u00f6bius band, a surface that differs topologically from a cylinder since it has only one side. Atiyah applied these ideas to \u201celliptic curves\u201d, actually doughnut-shaped surfaces with interesting number-theoretic properties.</p> <p>His next topic, K-theory, is a far-reaching extension of Noether\u2019s homology invariant.

      "bodyText": "The last time I met Michael Atiyah, who has died aged 89, was at Tate Modern in London; not the most likely place to run into probably Britain\u2019s greatest mathematician since Isaac Newton, but entirely consistent with his wide-ranging enthusiasm for his subject. It was June 2012, and I joined him and the flamboyant French mathematician C\u00e9dric Villani in a panel discussion: Mathematics, a Beautiful Elsewhere. The title says it all. We have sulphuric acid to thank for Atiyah\u2019s decision to become a mathematician. Early in 1940, as Britain and France fought over his homeland of Lebanon, his parents sent him to Victoria college in Cairo. In a 1984 interview he said that while there he got very interested in chemistry, but eventually decided that making \u201csulphuric acid and all that sort of stuff\u201d was not for him: \u201cLists of facts, just facts ...\u201d From that time on, mathematics became his passion. \u201cI never seriously considered doing anything else.\u201d Atiyah\u2019s work was to have a profound influence on today\u2019s mathematics. Atiyah was a geometer, in the sense of visual thinking allied to abstract symbolism, a new attitude that swept through mathematics in the middle of the 20th century. You thought about it like geometry but wrote about it like algebra, and very esoteric algebra at that. His research divides into four main periods, to some extent overlapping \u2013 in the 1950s, algebraic geometry; in the 60s and early 70s, K-theory; the 60s to 80s, index theory; and the late 70s to mid-80s, gauge theory, where his ideas became extremely influential in quantum physics. Algebraic geometry originally developed from a deep link between geometry and algebra promoted in the 1600s by Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Start with Euclid\u2019s plane and introduce coordinates \u2013 pairs of numbers describing the location of a point, much as latitude and longitude determine a point on the Earth\u2019s surface. Geometric properties of curves can then be described by algebraic equations, so questions in geometry can be tackled using algebra, and vice versa. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, a new kid appeared on the mathematical block: topology, in which geometrical shapes can be deformed as if made of elastic. Classical features such as lengths and angles lose their meaning, and are replaced by concepts such as being connected, knotted, or having a hole like a doughnut. Topology turned out to be fundamental to many areas of mathematics. Techniques were devised to associate with a topological space various \u201cinvariants\u201d, which reveal when spaces can or cannot be deformed into each other. One of the most powerful invariants, homology, was established by Emmy Noether, the greatest female mathematician of the late 1800s and early 1900s. She reinterpreted, in terms of abstract algebra, rudimentary methods for counting features such as the number of holes in a surface. In effect, Noether explained that as well as counting holes and associated structures, we can ask how they combine, and extract topological information from the answer. Atiyah began his research career in algebraic geometry, but under the influence of his supervisor, William Hodge, at Cambridge, he quickly moved into an adjacent field, differential geometry, which studies concepts such as curvature \u2014 how a space deviates from the flat plane of Euclid. There he made big advances in the interactions between algebraic geometry, differential geometry and topology. Euclid\u2019s investigations of a circle includes its tangents: straight lines that touch it at one point, like a road supporting a bicycle wheel. Similarly, a sphere has a family of tangent planes, one for each point on its surface. A general family of this kind is called a vector bundle: \u201cbundle\u201d because the sphere ties all the planes together, and \u201cvector\u201d because higher-dimensional analogues of lines and planes are called vector spaces. The topology of a vector bundle provides information about the underlying space. The tangents to a circle, for example, form a cylinder. As proof: rotate each tangent line through a right angle, out of the plane of the circle, and you get a cylinder. There is another vector bundle associated with a circle, in which the lines are twisted to form the famous M\u00f6bius band, a surface that differs topologically from a cylinder since it has only one side. Atiyah applied these ideas to \u201celliptic curves\u201d, actually doughnut-shaped surfaces with interesting number-theoretic properties. His next topic, K-theory, is a far-reaching extension of Noether\u2019s homology invariant. A cylinder and a M\u00f6bius band are topologically distinct because their associated bundles have different twists. K-theory exploits vector bundles to capture higher dimensional analogues of such twists. The topic underwent a period of rapid development in the 60s, stimulated by remarkable links to other major areas of mathematics, and it provided topologists with a powerful toolkit of invariants. Atiyah, often jointly with other leading mathematicians, was a driving force behind these developments. Important themes were the cobordism theory of Ren\u00e9 Thom (how one circle splits into two as you move down a pair of trousers from the waist to the leg holes, only done for multidimensional spaces) and the periodicity theorem, first proved by Raoul Bott, showing that higher K-groups repeat in a cycle of length eight. Index theory has its origins in the observation that topological features of a landscape, such as the numbers of mountain peaks, valleys and passes, are related to each other. To get rid of a peak by flattening it out you must also get rid of a pass, for example. The index organises such phenomena, and can be used, in suitable circumstances, to prove that a peak must exist in some region. A landscape is a metaphor for the graph of a mathematical function, and a sweeping generalisation relates the number of solutions of a differential equation to a more esoteric topological index. Differential equations relate rates of change of various quantities to each other, and are ubiquitous in mathematical physics; the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem, proved jointly with the American mathematician Isadore Singer in 1963, reveals a highly significant link between a topological index and the solutions of a differential equation. In an appropriate mathematical setting this can lead to a proof that a solution must exist, so the Atiyah-Singer index has widespread applications to physics. Forty years after their discovery, the pair were jointly awarded the Abel prize of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, in 2004. Gauge theory arose in physics, formalising certain symmetries of quantum fields and particles. The first example arose from James Clerk Maxwell\u2019s equations for the electromagnetic field (1861), where certain mathematical transformations can be applied without changing the physics.

Apostolos Giannou, not even in Arnold\u2019s initial squad, made a case for a starting spot after scoring from the bench last time out, while Andrew Nabbout is back in consideration after his groin twang cleared up, but the front three of Chris Ikonomidis, Awer Mabil and Jamie Maclaren may well stay the same.</p> <p><strong>So let\u2019s settle in and watch Australia progress, comfortably, right?</strong> Right?

      "bodyText": "And with that, I shall say goodbye. Thanks for reading everyone - always a pleasure. And here's the full Group B table, from the AFC website. So Australia qualify for the second round. Jordan win the group after their 0-0 draw with Palestine in the other game. Syria finish bottom and go out, which is a real shame based on their performance in the second-half of this one. Palestine must wait for the other results to see if they go through as one of the four best third-placed teams. What a cracking game that was. Australia dominated for spells but ceded the advantage too easily and almost contrived to throw the game away a couple of times. In the end, they hung on and obviously sealed things with that late Rogic pearler. The Celtic midfielder was the class player on the park, and if Australia are to retain the Asian Cup they\u2019ll need more performances like that from him. Peeeeeeeeeeeeep. 90 mins +3: Australia keep the ball for a long spell down the right, but after some back and forth Ikonomidis cuts the ball back to Rogic who has an absurd amount of space around 25 yards from goal, and he has time to pick his spot. Spot picked, he slams the ball home to send Australia through. And that\u2019s that! 90 mins: Four minutes of added time. Australia make a late change: Luongo off, and defender Matt Jurman comes on. 89 mins: Free-kick for Syria out on the right. The cross is half-cleared straight to Youssef, he briefly considers a first time shot but instead checks back, tries a delicate cross into the middle but it\u2019s not delicate enough, and goes out. 87 mins: Another corner for Syria, which despite the presence of Al-Soma making life extremely awkward, the Australian defence scramble it clear. But then Youseff gets down the left and cuts back on his right foot, crosses to the far post where Khribin lurks, but he just can\u2019t manage to direct his header at goal. 85 mins: Heavy pressure now from Syria. The dangerous Khribin has a cross that is blocked and put behind. He takes the corner himself, which makes its way out the Youseff on the edge of the area who tries a first-time shot, but it goes wide. 83 mins: Australia will be filthy with themselves if they throw this one away. The Syrians look re-energised after that goal, and they make a final substitution: Mohamad Zaher Almedani replaces Al Mbayed. 81 mins: One more change for Australia: Mabil is hooked, and Robbie Kruse comes on. Al-Soma takes the penalty himself, sends Ryan the wrong way and we now have quite a ten minutes on our hands. 79 mins: Well then! After Khribin has a fine free-kick saved, the ball is returned to the middle where Soma goes down in the area. Initially the referee is unmoved, but perhaps after a word from his assistant, points to the spot! 76 mins: Out of nowhere, Syria have a big chance. Three in a minute, in fact. Firstly Milligan does well to head a cross to the near post away, then Mawas booms over a big ball from the right that Soma heads but Ryan saves. Then another save for Ryan, as Khribin gets up for a header at the back stick, but that time he\u2019s penalised for something. Possibly a handball, possibly climbing on his marker. 75 mins: Post! Mabil slips a pass to Giannou on the right side of the box, he splits his stride and carefully thwacks a shot towards goal, but it hits the post and bounces out. Mabil gets to the rebound, but skews his effort wide. 74 mins: An alternative view on the penalty, here: Meanwhile, another change for the Syrians, as Abdul Malek Anizan replaces Jwayed. 73 mins: Sub for Syria - Fahad Youssef replaces Osman. 72 mins: Rogic has the ball in the net, but after some smashing interplay and passing, after which Rogic rounds the keeper to score, the offside flag is raised. 70 mins: Great chance for Ikonomids, getting some space down the left side of the area. He has a choice between opening up his body for a shot, or crossing to Giannou, but in the end does both and neither, opening his body and skewing a cross/shot out for a goal kick. 69 mins: Good chance for Australia, and Giannou and Mabil exchange passes after the former held the ball up nicely, it falls to Rogic but his shot is weak and easily saved. 67 mins: That\u2019s it for Maclaren, who comes off to be replaced by Apostolos Giannou. 66 mins: Eeesh, that penalty shout doesn\u2019t get any better with the replays. Meanwhile, Luongo splits the defence with a pass through to Maclaren, but the forward was marginally offside. 64 mins: Rogic tries another of those threaded passes through to Ikonomidis, but that one is blocked. 62 mins: Luongo is booked for a hooked challenge from behind on Mawas. Syria try to take a quick free-kick but waste it. 60 mins: Huge protests from the Syrians for a penalty: the ball very clearly hit Milligan on the arm inside the area, but the only reasonable explanation for the referee\u2019s decision not to penalise him was that the ball popped up off the Aussie captain\u2019s foot. Could have gone either way, that. 59 mins: Mawas goes into the book for sticking his elbow in Behich\u2019s face. It might have been accidental, but he can\u2019t complain too much. Well, obviously he can, because he does. At length. 57 mins: Just a brief post-goal interlude, for something nothing to do with this game: here\u2019s Raul Meireles performing in Portugal\u2019s version of \u2018Lip Sync Battle\u2019. Enjoy. 54 mins: Brilliant work from Rogic out on the left, swinging over one of those nightmare crosses that give defences nightmares. Jwayed almost seems to leave it as the ball goes towards the back post, possibly not realising that Ikonomidis was there, but the forward lunges towards the ball and stabs it under Alma. A desperate dive tries to hook it off the line, but it had just gone over - the Syrians protest at length, but the goal is given. Just - just - over the line! 52 mins: Ryan gets away with one after slicing a clearance straight to Mawas who heads it straight back into the danger area, but Australia get away with it because Osman and another player (Soma, I think) were offside. 51 mins: Good play from both teams: nice play between Behich - with a little nutmeg thrown in - and Ikonomidis sets the latter into the penalty area, but Mohamad had tracked his run and did enough to ease him off the ball. Good attacking, good defending. 49 mins: Al-Saleh humps a long ball downfield, but Australia deal with it well enough. 47 mins: Mabil, pumped with confidence from his goal before the break, lines up the free-kick...but sends it miles over. 46 mins: We\u2019re off. Australia immediately have a free-kick around 30 yards out, just to the left of centre. The players are back out for the second-half. Weird opening 45 for Australia - they started sluggishly, got back into the game and capitalised on their latter good play with a superb goal, then immediately threw it all away by conceding straight afterwards. Well then. First thing to say is the other game in the group, between Palestine and Jordan, is currently 0-0. So as things stand, the group is very much as you were, with Jordan top on seven points, Australia second with four, then Syria and Palestine on two each, the former ahead on goal difference. Peeeeeeeeeeeep. 45 mins: Australian nearly retake the lead on the stroke of half-time. Maclaren gets to the near-post and flicks a shot towards goal, but Alma saves. This has turned into a terrific game. 43 mins: The old cliche about a team being most vulnerable just after scoring, which is usually rot and nonsense, turns out to be true! Al-Jaan puts in a great cross from the left, Khribin gets up in the middle to meet the header, Mat Ryan saves really well, but Khribin himself reacts quickest to slam the rebound into the roof of the net. The lead lasts barely a minute! 41 mins: Australia take a quick free-kick and Ikonomidis feeds Mabil on the right side of the area, he cuts back onto his left foot and curls an absolutely sensational shot into the top corner. What a goal! 40 mins: Eventually from that corner a cross is clipped to the far post where Mabil is on his own. He hits a strong first-time volley but it\u2019s blocked in the middle: the shot might have been heading wide, but Maclaren was waiting right behind the defender to turn it home. 39 mins: Australia on top here: Ikonomidis shimmies to create a bit of space on the left side of the area, but his attempt at a cross is put behind for a corner. 38 mins: Lovely piece of skill by Osman to skip around Irvine, but ultimately it comes to nothing. 36 mins: Australia go close again with their best bit of football of the game. Some slick interplay eventually leads to Rogic playing an absolutely beautiful threaded pass to Maclaren on the right side of the box. He tries to beat Alma at the near-post, the shot is saved but rebounds back to him, and the second shot is saved too. 35 mins: Ikonomidis takes a rather more direct route to goal, unleashing a woof of a shot from about 25 yards that Alma saves. 34 mins: Ikonomidis is fed by Rogic to the left of the area but quiet literally runs around in a circle before crossing, a cross that is easily headed away. GOA...NO! 30 mins: That free-kick is fizzed into the middle by Ajaan, seems to miss absolutely everyone and goes straight into the net! But wait! Osman had showed Milligan what physical contact really should be, quite brutally blocking him off as he tried to intercept the ball. Milligan looks groggy for a bit, but gets to his feet and continues. 29 mins: Milligan delicately brushes the shirt of Osman, much like a master dressmaker might gently caress a beautiful new piece of fabric. Osman drops to the floor as if smacked with a house brick, and Syria have a free-kick out on the right. 28 mins: Mabil pops up on the right this time and plays a threatening low ball into the middle, but it\u2019s cleared. 27 mins: Mabil has been pretty quiet so far, but he makes progress down the left and cuts in, shooting when perhaps he could have crossed. The effort is blocked, and Rogic just fails to pick up the pieces. 25 mins: Corrections and clarifications dept: you\u2019re quite right, although that does depend on other results. 24 mins: Grant suddenly looks a big threat down the right for Australia: Luongo plays him in, he belts into the area and tries a low cross but Al-Saleh gets there in the nick of time to concede a corner, which ultimately comes to nothing. 21 mins: Oh, HUGE chance for Australia. Grant is played in down the right and immediately flings in a perfect cross to Maclaren, who nicks a yard from his marker and meets the header in the middle of the goal, about eight yards out...but glances it wide. 20 mins: And once more, Al-Soma, causing problems in the Australian defence. A big cross from the left aiming for the striker goes just behind him, then skips up and strikes Behich on the arm. Big penalty shouts...which are stopped by the offside flag. Al-Soma\u2019s forehead was just - just beyond the last man. 19 mins: There\u2019s Al-Soma again, collecting a long ball forwards in the area, but he loses his footing at the crucial moment and falls to the turf. There are some vague calls for a penalty, but it was pretty clear the centre-forward slipped. 18 mins: Al-Soma tries a run from deep but he\u2019s eventually stopped. He looks a handful though, to say the least. 17 mins: Australia inch their way back into the game. Luongo cuts a cross back from the left but it\u2019s cleared. 15 mins: Free-kick for Australia out on the right. Rogic and Grant play a little training ground game, each pretending the other is going to swing the cross over, before the former eventually does but the header by Milligan is well saved by Alma. 13 mins: Chance - no, two chances - for Syria: Firstly Mawas gets down the right and does brilliantly to dig out a cross into the middle, and Soma rises semi-unchallenged in the middle to get the header, but he sends it over. Then Khribin is played in on the right side of the area and skims a low shot along the ground, but it goes just wide. Some troubling gaps in the Australia defence there, though. 11 mins: Khribin drifts into the middle from the left and tries to surge towards goal, but he\u2019s knocked to the ground by Irvine, gets up then is knocked to the ground by Rogic. The second foul is penalised. 8 mins: Ikonomidis makes a run down the left channel and for a second it looks like he might streak through on goal, but a fine challenge by Jwayed halts his progress. 6 mins: Australia attack for the first time, after a fashion. Behich charges down the left and clips a cross over, but Syria keeper Alma jumps to catch with no real problems. 4 mins: Syria win a free-kick from absolutely miles out - probably not far off 40 yards when the angle is taken into account, just out to the left. Soma doesn\u2019t let that discourage him though, and takes a long-jumper\u2019s run-up for the shot, but predictably enough it doesn\u2019t make it past the collection of gathered defenders. 3 mins: Not much to report from the opening few minutes. A period of lightly jabbing each other as both teams feel their way into the game. 1 min: We\u2019re away. Syria kick-off and launch the ball straight down the field. The players are out, lined up and ready to go. Incidentally, it seems Al-Saleh\u2019s kind words about the new coach has paid off: he\u2019s captain today, for the first time. A few minutes til kick-off, just enough time to read this interview with Philippines coach, Mr Sven Goran Eriksson. The Philippines are out having lost their first two games...but...still. As mentioned earlier, Syria sacked their coach Bernd Stange - a man familiar to the Australians since he used to coach Perth Glory - after the last game, a 2-0 defeat to Jordan. And it sounds like the decision was a popular one, if centre-back Ahmad Al-Saleh\u2019s views are representative of the dressing room: I would blame the previous coach 100 percent. He didn\u2019t have the right plans for us, and you can see the result. As soon as Fajr (interim coach Fajr Ibrahim) arrived at the pitch, we knew his tactics and his plans. We all like him and we all wanted him as head coach. Match preview? Match preview. Australia Ryan; Grant, Milligan, Degenek, Behich; Luongo, Irvine; Rogic; Ikonomidis, Maclaren, Mabil. Syria Alma; Al Salih, Al Jwayed, Ajan, Al Midani; Haj Mohamad, Al Mawas, Mobayed, Osman; Khribin, Al Somah. This should be relatively straightforward for Australia, right? Right? Second in the group, poised to saunter through to the second round, all that\u2019s required is a point against a Syria team who haven\u2019t managed a goal in the tournament yet and who with flamboyant disregard for mid-tournament etiquette, sacked their manager after their last game. And yet. And yet. We all expect Graham Arnold\u2019s side to make shortish work of this one and continue in their defence of the trophy, but then again we expected them to beat Jordan in the opening game. Defeat there is why we now reach the third group game in a state of slight uncertainty, and perhaps more than that why there\u2019s a hint of doubt at the back of everyone\u2019s mind that, actually, trouble might be ahead. The only change from the 3-0 win over Palestine last time out - a win which caused a sigh of relief with more force than the Freemantle Doctor - is expected to be QPR\u2019s Massimo Luongo in for the suspended Trent Sainsbury, with skipper Mark Milligan dropping back into defence. Apostolos Giannou, not even in Arnold\u2019s initial squad, made a case for a starting spot after scoring from the bench last time out, while Andrew Nabbout is back in consideration after his groin twang cleared up, but the front three of Chris Ikonomidis, Awer Mabil and Jamie Maclaren may well stay the same. So let\u2019s settle in and watch Australia progress, comfortably, right? Right? G...guys? Right? Kick-off: 00:30am AEDT/13.30GMT/17.30 local",

Thiem will face Alexei Popyrin, the 19-year-old Australian in the next round. \u201cI wish it could have been a little bit shorter,\u201d Thiem says. \u201cIt\u2019s 2.15am, thank you guys for staying up so late.

      "bodyText": "What a marathon, a five-set slog. But it is Dominic Thiem, the No 7 who comes out on top. Benoit Paire did superbly to fight back from two sets down but, eventually, came unstuck as Thiem dipped into the reserve tank at the death. Almost four hours later, Paire\u2019s wait to beat a top-10 player in a slam for only the second time goes on. A huge effort from both players. Thiem will face Alexei Popyrin, the 19-year-old Australian in the next round. \u201cI wish it could have been a little bit shorter,\u201d Thiem says. \u201cIt\u2019s 2.15am, thank you guys for staying up so late. But I\u2019m very happy that I thought back and I will use a nice day off tomorrow.\u201d Dominic Thiem earns a FOURTH match point. Can he? Wow! Thiem arches is back in agony, as Paire saves not one but three match points. Paire bounces a shot off the net cord to take things to deuce. What a contest, with Paire, on his haunches, producing some wonder shots. A disbelieving Thiem looks like he just wants the court to gobble him up. Thiem goes to 40-15. He has two match points. Thiem moves to 30-15 at 5-3 up. It has gone 2am in Melbourne, maybe that explains Paire\u2019s ridiculous challenges. Anything will do at this stage of the game. Thiem breaks Paire \u2013 after a 21-shot marathon rally! Things were looking rosy when Paire slammed his 21st of the match zooming beyond Thiem. But then he missed a simple backhand at 40-30. At deuce, his first serve lets him down and then he fires a wild forehand wide. At break point, Thiem stays in a long slog of a rally and Paire, whose legs fell strenuously heavy, cannot pull off an ambitious lob. Dominic Thiem will serve for the game, set and match ... Thiem leads the final set 4-3. Paire, with his collar up, is not feeling quite so cool. Paire spoons a backhand long, and Thiem clinches the seventh game of the fifth set. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s game. Paire clinches his service game. It\u2019s 3-3 in the fifth. It\u2019s hardly cloak and dagger, as Thiem wins another service game. A 13th double fault by Thiem almost allows Paire in for a sniff of a break. But a gift by the Frenchman \u2013 a sloppy forehand into the net \u2013 helps Thiem re-take the lead. Thiem leads 3-2 in the fifth. Just as they started this match, Thiem and Paire are looking inseparable once more, level-pegging at 2-2 in the fifth set. And just as Thiem sensed he could break Paire, the Frenchman hammers an unstoppable serve down the middle of the court to oil the engine for a comeback. Then a sweeping forehand leaves Thiem in trouble. A fist pump from Thiem, as he moves into the lead in the final set. The Austrian, who has been pegged back after establishing a two-set lead, is 2-1 up in the fifth. We will have a winner, sooner or later. It is 1.40am local time in Melbourne, so the numbers are dwindling in the crowd. There are a couple of hundred spectators left. A fairly predictable start to the fifth set: Paire is bouncing from pillar to post, darting into the net and lapping up Thiem\u2019s mistakes. Thiem is staggering round the court, allowing Paire a comfortable hold. It is 1-1, with Thiem serving to try and snatch back the lead. The atmosphere has fallen flat. Even the crowd are exhausted. Inevitably, in the end, Benoit Paire wins the fourth set 6-1! And the Frenchman probably heads into the fifth \u2013 and final \u2013 set against Dominic Thiem as favourite. Both players were trying to expend a little less energy in the closing stages of that one, safe in the knowledge they were going to have to try and last the distance. It may come down to who has more legs left to finish the job. Thiem does look shattered, Paire a little more composed. The fourth set is turning into something of a whitewash. Benoit Paire is absolutely flying. He feels a million dollars, 5-0 up now. Paire is a game away from restoring parity. He has shown some real mettle. Thiem needs to try and arrest the slide. His bounce-back ability is part of the reason he has established himself inside the top 10 in the world, but he is way off the pace at the moment. Paire, by contrast, can suddenly do no wrong. Paire storms into a 3-0 lead in the fourth set. And a brittle-looking Dominic Thiem feels like the world is against him. First he is on the wrong end of a challenge from Paire\u2019s serve before his opponent\u2019s wild backhand helps him back in. But the Frenchman steadies himself and takes a fifth consecutive game. Thiem is struggling. Funny old game, eh? It is a case of role reversal on Margaret Court, with Benoit Paire suddenly in the driving seat, having raced into a 2-0 lead in the fourth set. Thiem looks weary and could badly do with changing things up a little, if he has the energy or appetite to do so. A five-setter is the last thing he needs. Benoit Paire wins the third set 7-5 \u2013 but the winner is extremely fortuitous! Paire earns a third set point \u2013 and this time takes it \u2013 with a dinked drop shot glancing off the roof of the net and fooling Dominic Thiem, who suddenly looks as though he\u2019s on his last legs. Neither player can have much left in the tank, with three hours of play gone. So, it\u2019s 4-6, 3-6, 7-5 \u2013 and counting. Paire takes it to 6-5 in the third. Can Thiem bounce back? Dominic Thiem saves two set points to take proceedings to 5-5 in the third. Paire lets Thiem back in at 40-15, and boots the tennis ball in fury. Thiem takes it to deuce, when Paire\u2019s ambitious lob doesn\u2019t come off. Then comes an unwavering ace, his fifth of this marathon contest. Relief for team Thiem, who is sweating buckets. Hats off to Benoit Paire, who shows superb resilience to poke his nose in front at 5-4 in the third. He had to dig in and stave off Thiem in a slogging rally at deuce, before the Frenchman took advantage. So close yet so far for Thiem, who already has two sets in the bag. He must have thought the end was nigh, two-and-a-half hours in. Saying that, it still could be. Thiem levels things up at 4-4 \u2013 but Pair is not a happy bunny, insisting the Austrian\u2019s winner was outside the line. Wishful thinking on Paire\u2019s part. All of that after Paire spanners his racket into the advertising hoardings and the umpire tells off a spectator \u2013 like a naughty child at teatime \u2013 for having a word with Paire, in what is a fairly empty court. Paire holds to take the next game and move in front at 4-3. He may be two sets behind, but the Frenchman has shown plenty of fight. Thiem thought he had rumbled Paire then, but was defeated at deuce. Can Paire finish off the job? Paire eats up another service game. He leads Thiem 3-2 in the third set. Both have squandered chances to run off into the sunset. Paire leads the third set 2-1. Paire is working his way through a lovely back catalogue of shots \u2013 a cheeky lob, a deft touch and a cute volley. The Frenchman is trying to change the course of this match, but Thiem still holds all the cards, two sets to the good. A lax volley at the net almost sees Paire come unstuck but he \u2013 just about \u2013 comes out on top of a very fun rally. Thiem works wonders to reach a dink that drops right on the tramlines and then kisses the net, but Paire prospers. Dominic Thiem picks up the second set 6-3, topping things off with a ripping backhand down the line. It was a real beauty. Thiem is very much in the driving seat, looking comfortable. Benoit Paire, however, looks shot. A spent force, perhaps. Nick Kyrgios has had his say on his first-round exit: I don\u2019t think that was at all the reason I lost today. He [Milos Raonic] played unbelievable. Unbelievable serving. Never seen serving like that in my life. I\u2019ve never been a part of it. I was just watching it literally going side to side. I was trying to mix up where I was standing, trying to move before, during, like trying to do anything. He was in such a good rhythm on serve, I couldn\u2019t do anything. He was way too good tonight. Every time I returned, he served and volleyed. He volleyed unbelievable. He was so composed on big points, he made returns, jag returns on big points on my serve. He was way too good for me tonight.\u201d The winner of this match faces Alexei Popyrin, the teenage Australian who sent Mischa Zverev packing a little earlier. The 19-year-old won 7-5, 7-6, 6-4 and his reward will be a date with either Thiem or Paire. Time for a quick glance at the second-round action coming your way: Men\u2019s singles draw Djokovic v Tsonga, Daniel v Shapovalov, Goffin v Copil, Harrison v Medvedev, Fognini v Mayer, Ivashka v Carreno Busta, Kohlschreiber v Sousa, Karlovic v Nishikori, Zverev v Chardy, Bolt v Simon, Chung v Herbert, Wawrinka v Raonic, Coric v Fucsovics, Donskay v Krajinovic, Pouille v Marterer, Cilic v McDonald, Albot v Verdasco, Bautista Agut v Millman, Nishioka v Khachanov, Tsitsipas v Troicki, Travaglia v Basilashvili, Monfils v Fritz, Evans v Federer, Anderson v Tiafoe, Thompson v Seppi, Dimitrov v Cuevas, Fabbiano v Opelka, Berdych v Haase, Kuala v Schwartzman, de Minaur v Laaksonen, Ebden v Nadal, Popyrin v Paire/Thiem After a very competitive first set, the crowd are filtering out from Margaret Court, as Paire begins to throw his toys out of the pram. He cuts a frustrated figure, while Thiem has steadied himself at the perfect time. He looks composed and ready to thrash out what\u2019s left of this set. Thiem leads 4-1 in the second, with Paire serving. But the Frenchman wallops a superb backhand beyond Thiem and kickstarts the comeback. Ah, Benoit Paire is livid with himself after failing to build on taking the first game of the second set. Thiem fights back into pole position, to lead 2-1 in the second. A wide forehand by the Frenchman helps Thiem into the ascendency. As day two gradually draws to a close, a quick look at the women\u2019s second-round action on the way over the next 48 hours: Women\u2019s singles draw Halep v Kenin, Cornet v V Williams, Navarro v Yastremska, Bouchard v S Williams, Bacsinszky v Vikhlyantseva, Konta v Muguruza, Giorgi v Swiatek, Brengle v Pliskova, Osaka v Zidansek, Siegemund v Hsieh, Wang v Krunic, Andreescu v Sevastova, Mertens v Gasparyan, Potapova v Keys, Zhang v Pliskova, Kuzmova v Svitolina, Kvitova v Begu, Bencic v Putintseva, Tsurenko v Anisimova, Boulter v Sabalenka, Barty v Wang, Sharma v Sakkari, Sharapova v Peterson, Larsson v Wozniacki, Stephens v Babos, Vondrousova v Martic, Kontaveit v Sasnovich, Pavlyuchenkova v Bertens, Collins v Vickery, Hives v Garcia, Vekic v Birrell, Haddad Maia v Kerber Dominic Theim wins first set against Benoit Paire 6-4! A wild return by Thiem helps Paire to deuce, who pulls out a timely fifth ace. Paire then throws one long, and challenges in vain. Thiem then gets a slice of luck, holding his hands up apologetically as his backhand cannons off the top of the net, eluding the Frenchman. And then Paire darts wide and Thiem takes the set. Paire is grumbling that Thiem\u2019s shot was out, but the umpire is having none of it. The Austrian takes first blood. What a game! Benoit Paire and Dominic Thiem are inseparable, with the Frenchman turning it on to breeze through and take the eighth game. They are neck and neck at 4-4 in the first set. Paire has never gone further than the third round in Melbourne. The winner will play Alexei Popyrin, the 19-year-old who swatted Mischa Zverev aside earlier. Thiem looks a little rattled, summed up by a double fault after a hefty second serve. Osaka sealed victory over Linette in just 58 minutes, but Thiem and Paire are thrashing things out on Margaret Court. It is hard graft for both players, both slogging it out, with the Austrian shading it at the moment. Thiem leads 3-2, but it look as though it is going to be a marathon. Both are pretty nifty on serve. No breaks so far. Thiem made it to the fourth round in 2017 and 2018. Naomi Osaka, the reigning US Open, talks. The 21-year-old made that look easy. First things first, what about those pesky bugs? \u201cI\u2019m not really that great at catching, I would accidentally squish them so it\u2019s probably not a good idea for me [to help remove them].\u201d Don\u2019t say I don\u2019t bring you all the big news and reaction. After a raft of 16 winners helped clinch the first set, Naomi Osaka wraps up the second with an aggressive finish against Magda Linette. Only after a ballboy makes a real mess of removing an unwanted beastie from the court. The crowd love it, though, gasping and sighing at the ballboys\u2019 troubles, before Osaka proceeds to breeze to 40-0. The Japanese takes the final game with a dynamite ace. Osaka seals victory inside the hour. Deep into day two, Dominic Thiem gets the ball rolling with two shellacking aces. On Rod Laver, Naomi Osaka leads 3-1 in the second set after clinching the first. Magda Linette has it all to do. What\u2019s still on the menu on day two? Well, Naomi Osaka is into the second set of her duel with Magda Linette and Benoit Paire takes on No 7 seed Dominic Thiem on Margaret Court shortly, after Halep has just beaten Kanepi in what proved a real battle for last year\u2019s runner-up. A reminder that Johanna Konta, Elina Svitolina, Serena and Venus Williams, Alex Zverev and Kei Nishikori are among the names to have already booked their second-round spots. Halep talks after a fine comeback victory, against Kanepi, who knocked the Romanian out of the US Open. \u201cI don\u2019t want to remember that match because it was a tough one,\u201d the world No 1 says. \u201cI knew that she was a very tough opponent, I had to be strong on the legs and believe that I could win the match. I am very happy that I can play in the second round. It is not easy to play against Kaia.\u201d Halep really does speak brilliantly too, and does so here in this interview with Donald McRae: The No 1 was pushed all of the way, but Halep is all smiles after fighting back to beat Kaia Kanepi, who left the Romanian in a real quandary after the first set. A sigh of relief as Halep gets the job done. A bruising defeat for Kanepi, who performed magnificently. Halep knows she was a little lucky to be able to come back, up the ante and take victory. Kanepi will serve to stay in the match. A no-nonsense, business-like game from Halep means she is now just a few points away from a place in the second round. Kalepi has amassed a worrying 56 unforced errors. Halep has shown great mental strength after dropping the first set. Can she complete the comeback? Want to feel warm and fuzzy about Andy Murray again? A medical timeout for Kanepi, who needs treatment on a bloody and blistered left hand, moments after Simona Halep broke serve to motor into a 4-2 lead in he third. Halep did brilliantly to dig herself out of a hole, with Kanepi failing to punish the Romanian at 40-0, only for Halep to turn it around. Naomi Osaka, the No 4, is 3-2 up in the first set against Magda Linette. Meanwhile, Shuang Zhai topples 26th seed Dominika Cibulkova 6-2 4-6 6-2. She\u2019ll face Kristyna Pliskova in round two. Raonic talks, after easing past Kyrgios. He will play Stan Wawrinka in round two. \u201cI\u2019m very glad I served well, that was incredibly important,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to come forward, I have done it in spurts in my career but I need to give myself a chance to play at the top level. It\u2019s tough against Nick because he takes the match through so many motions, so it\u2019s important that you stay on top yourself. On to the next one.\u201d On Margaret Court, Halep and Kanepi are level-pegging at 2-2 in the third set. A trademark start by Milos Raonic, who wellies another ace down the middle of the court. Nick Kyrgios can only bow his head. But back comes Kyrgios with an arcing forehand \u2013 the crowd soak it up. Then comes another lethal ace before Raonic removed the angles for Kyrgios, who plays a forehand into the net to earn the Canadian two match points. He doesn\u2019t need them both, sealing victory with an unerring ace, of course. Kyrgios earns himself a stay of execution. He turns it on, racing into a 40-0 lead, with an unnecessary no-look forehand rounding things off nicely. A swift service game by Kyrgios. So, Raonic will serve for the match. It still feels like only a matter of time. Kyrgios will serve to stay in the match! Raonic comes to the net after a dominant forehand and Kyrgios can only reply with a wild shot, almost verging into Row Z territory. Raonic has looked in the mood throuhgout, very clever at the net, with a couple of cute volleys. His game is not entirely reliant on aces. Raonic is just a game away from dumping Kyrgios out on home soil. Halep, meanwhile, has taken the first game of the third set, nudging herself in front for the first time on Margaret Court. The home crowd are roaring on Nick Kyrgios \u2013 but can he deliver the goods? Raonic hammers another ace \u2013 a preposterous 26th in this match \u2013 down the middle of the court to power into a 4-2 lead in the third. Raonic\u2019s performance has been calm and slick, typified by a sweeping forehand on the angle beyond the Australian as Kyrgios groaned his way through an earlier rally. Halep \u2013 at long last \u2013 wins the second set 6-4! Kalepi takes the No 1 the full distance. It was a marathon 10th game, but Halep eventually prospers, after slapping her thighs in frustration after failing to finish off Kalepi in three previous set points. Nick Kyrgios, meanwhile, is throwing a wobbly, fuming at the line judge and, before long, he will doubtless be throwing in the towel. Raonic has broken serve and leads by two sets, 3-2 up in the third. Halep is having to dig deep against Kanepi. The No 1 was knocked out of the US Open by the Estonian and has no intentions of a repeat. Kanepi will serve to stay in the second set after Halep, last year\u2019s runner-up in Melbourne, pulls out all of the stops to power into a 5-4 lead. As for Kyrgios, he is showcasing the good, bad and the ugly of his game, as he moves 2-1 up in the third. Raonic is very much in the driving seat, though, two sets to the good. It is never plain sailing when Kyrgios is involved. And further treatment on his right knee in the changeover. Some breathtaking tennis, from both sides, but, in the end, it was a fairly routine win for the No 1. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga awaits. Djokovic is serving for the match, 5-2 up in the third. Just Australian hopes looked to be dwindling, with Kyrgios rampages beyond Raonic to take the first game of the third set from 40-0. Of course. As for Halep, she is beginning to shade things against Kanepi, up 4-3 in the second. Raonic takes the second set 7-6! Things go from bad to worse for Nick Kyrgios, who loses out in the tie-break 7-5. It is extremely difficult to see the Australian taking it to five sets on this evidence, clearly not too invested in the outcome, either way. Raonic, the No 16, has outclassed Kyrgios from start to finish so far. Kyrgios has only came back to record victory from two sets down twice in his career. Simona Halep, meanwhile, has rallied on Margaret Court, hitting back to 3-3 in the second. It is all a bit cat-and-mouse between Djokovic and Krueger, as the Serb edges into a 3-2 lead in the third. Djokovic delights as he breaks Krueger at long last, punching the air and, clearly, he is no longer just breezing these games. A wonderful dinked drop shot helps Djokovic on his way but, after breaking, he has the tools to power away now. Things are hotting up around the courts: Djokovic and Krueger are tied at 2-2 in the third, while Kaia Kanepi continues to pile the pressure on the No 1 seed Simona Halep. The Romanian trails 2-1 in the second in what is turning out to be a pretty miserable match against Kanepi. As for Kyrgios, he is hardly going down with a fight. Kyrgios appears to be experimenting with half-baked drop shots, while Raonic is so well-drilled. His aces are killing the game; the Canadian has powered a monstrous 27 serves in a row past his opposite number without reply. Nevertheless, Kyrgios takes the second set to an unlikely tie-break. Krueger saves five break points to lead 2-1 in the third set. Djokovic looks pretty exasperated. At Melbourne Arena, not only is Raonic schooling Kyrgios but the former is rattling through points on service. He just won 23 points in a row on his serve. Pretty frightening statistics. The numbers that matter, though, are that Raonic leads 6-5 in the second after taking the first. Stan Wawrinka awaits the winner. Krueger is not going quietly. The American takes things to an eighth deuce against Djokovic in the third game of the third set. Both No 1s are certainly being made to work. Meanwhile, Nick Kyrgios is serving to stay in the second set against the Canadian Milos Raonic. A showboating Kyrgios has just thrown a backhand into the net. Kanepi wins first set 7-6 against Halep! The No 1\u2019s late mini-resurgence ultimately proves in vain as Kanepi storms the tie-break 7-2. Kanepi\u2019s power is causing havoc for Halep, last year\u2019s runner-up in Australia, who it goes without saying, is almightily frustrated. Kanepi knocked Halep out of the first round of the US Open last year. Bludgeoning strokes are again proving fatal for Halep. Deja vu! Krueger, meanwhile, is lighting up the game on Rod Laver, with an extraordinary volley at the net wooing the crowd as he makes life difficult for the Serb at 1-1 in the third. Even Djokovic is impressed. Simona Halep wriggles out of trouble against Kaia Kanepi! The No 1 survives two set points on Margaret Court. She is a warrior and fights back against the No 70 to take it to a tie-break, digging deep with a fierce defence, holding with a backhand winner. At Melbourne Arena, Milos Raonic continues to get the better of Nick Kyrgios, who trails 3-2 in the second set after the Canadian wrapped up the first. Meanwhile, Krueger, who has given a decent account of himself, takes the first game in the third against Djokovic before the Serb pulls level. Djokovic wins the second set 6-2! This looks every inch like being the routine three-set victory that the No 1 will have been confident of from the outset. Krueger has played some nice stuff, but this is threatening to turn into a cakewalk. Djokovic has shown touches of class but has not really had to get out of first gear. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga awaits. If only Halep was finding things so easy. The Romanian is serving to stay in the first set. Raonic takes the first set 6-4 against Kyrgios! The Australian is seemingly struggling with his right knee. Over on Margaret Court, the No 1 seed Simona Halep is not having it all her own away against Kaia Kanepi. The Romanian has been made to work to hit back to 4-4 in the first. Dominika Cibulkova, meanwhile, will also have to come from behind if she is to reach the second round. Zhang Shuai won the first set 6-2 and is determined to go the distance in the second at 4-4. Djokovic leads Krueger 4-1. Nick Kyrgios, meanwhile, has a green-and-gold army of fans behind him against Milos Raonic. It is a tightly-contested affair, which feels more like a quarter-final than a first-round match-up. But is there trouble in paradise for the Australian? Kyrgios has the trainer on, receiving treatment on his right knee. Raonic leads 5-4. Djokovic is making light work of this contest \u2013 but it is not lacking in entertainment. A sweet Djokovic drop shot lands Krueger in trouble, and his ambitious backs-to-the-wall tweener cannot get him out of jail. But then Krueger plays a beautiful forehand whizzing past Djokovic. It\u2019s enough for the Serb to applaud his opponent, who rightly basks in such marvel. At the Melbourne Arena, Kyrgios and Raonic are duelling in the first, though the Canadian is edging things at 4-4. Halep trails Kanepi 2-3. We have an upset: Filip Krajinovic defeats No 17 seed Marco Cecchinato 4-6, 0-6 6-1, 7-6(8), 6-4 to reach the second round at the Australian Open for the first time. Djokovic, meanwhile, is all smiles. The Serb is playing some lovely tennis, in the groove after a sluggish start. After kissing the top of the net on four successive occasions, even Carlos Ramos cannot help but chuckle. \u201cCome on, man!\u201d says Djokovic as he strikes the net cord \u2013 again. Djokovic leads 2-1 in the second. Halep and Kyrgios are both level-pegging for now in the first, 1-1 and 3-3 respectively. Ah, lovely! A devastating Djokovic backhand down the line tees him up to break in the first game of the second. Krueger has shown he has plenty of shots in his armoury, without making a dent in Djokovic, who is slowly wearing down the American qualifier. Djokovic leads 6-3, 1-0. Elsewhere, the women\u2019s top seed, Simona Halep, is under way on Margaret Court. Raonic takes the first game against Kyrgios, playing in front of a home crowd, at the Melbourne Arena. Meanwhile, the victorious 18-year-old Dayana Yastremska is feeling understandably buoyant. The Ukrainian defeated home home Sam Stosur in straight sets. \u201cI hope in the next two weeks you are going to get to know me more and more,\u201d she says. As for Djokovic\u2019s match on Rod Laver, a gentle reminder that the winner will play Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, a wildcard this time around. A couple of other results to sink your teeth into: Pliskova has beaten Blinkova, while Margarita Gasparyan fought back to prevail against Lin Zhu. Djokovic wraps up the first set 6-3! But Kreuger did brilliantly to survive the first match point, receiving a standing ovation from a 15,000 crowd after taking Djokovic the distance to deuce, with a couple of wonderful cute volleys at the net. That was arguably the best rally of the tournament. Yet a wayward backhand helps Djokovic back in and, this time, the Serb makes no mistake, with a sweeping forehand getting the job done. Djokovic grinds through the gears to break again. The Serb is serving for the set after a series of unforced errors by Krueger. Meanwhile, some more goodwill towards Andy Murray from the tennis world, this time courtesy of Thanasi Kokkinakis, who was forced to retire against Taro Daniel. \u201cI love that dude,\u201d the Australian says. \u201cHe\u2019s super nice. When I was playing matches in Hopman Cup, he\u2019d send me massive paragraphs about things he thinks I should do on court, what could help me, stuff like that.\u201d Venus is through, and wants to stick around. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go home,\u201d Williams says. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to make it my permanent residence down here. It does feel like a second home. I love it here, I have lots of friends here and it\u2019s great to get another match.\u201d Meanwhile, Djokovic leads Krueger 4-3 on Rod Laver. The No 1 is in the driving seat, winning an obvious challenge after a long serve. A couple more results: the Ukrainian teenager Dayana Yastremska has sent Sam Stosur packing, with the 18-year-old prospering inside 78 minutes. The No 59 seed wins 7-5, 6-2. Another forgettable tournament for Stosur. In the men\u2019s draw, Stan Wawrinka is through \u2013 with a little help from his opposite number. Ernests Gulbis retires mid-way through the second, after rampaging through to win the first 6-1. A wry smile by Djokovic, as Hawk-Eye judges his volley just \u2013 just \u2013 in on the outside. Now he is in the mood, though, bouncing back to lead 3-2 with a routine service game. Elsewhere, if Marco Cecchinato is to reach the second round then he will do so the hard way. The Italian is into a fifth set, in which he trails to Filip Krajinovic, Djokovic\u2019s countryman. As for Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, he\u2019s got the job done against Martin Klizan, with the wildcard edging out the Slovakian in a tie-break in the third. The 2008 finalist is through after securing a 6-4 6-4 7-6(5) victory. On Rod Laver, Djokovic may only be in the embryonic stages of his duel with Mitchell Krueger, but the American qualifier is a break up in the first. The No 1 looks very calm, though, and it is difficult not to see the Serb breezing into the second round; Krueger has only won three tour-level matches in his career. Djokovic is primed for a good tournament \u2013 but behind early on to the world No 230. It was a fight \u2013 but Williams prevails. A strong, formidable finish by the American, who joins sister Serena in the second round after eventually getting the better of Mihaela Buzarnescu, who took the first set on a tie-break. But Buzarnescu let the match slip away from her, with the 38-year-old digging to deep to record a victory inside three testing sets. A timely reminder from Venus that she is going nowhere just yet. Simona Halep, the No 1 seed, is next up on Margaret Court against Kaia Kanepi. As Williams-Buzarnescu heats up \u2013 with Venus serving for the match \u2013 a quick time-out to hear from Sasha Zverev who overcame Aljaz Bedene 6-4, 6-1, 6-1 earlier on on Rod Laver, where Djokovic is currently making a start against Krueger. His older brother, Mischa Zverev, has been rocked by Alexei Popyrin, though. The 19-year-old Aussie is through to the second round of a major for the first time in his career after defeating Zverev 7-5 7-6(7) 6-4. As for Sascha, he says: \u201cBeing No 4 in the world, normally people reach their limits, but I still feel like I have so much room and I still have so many kind of holes in my game where I can improve.\u201d Disbelief on Margaret Court, as the umpire calls for hindrance as Buzarnescu buries a winner against Williams at 30-15. Buzarnescu is pulled up for a celebratory fist pump and the point is revoked by a stone-cold umpire. That revs up Buzarnescu, who is fuming at that decision, fuelling the Romanian to fight back to trail 4-2 in the third. Williams looked almost embarrassed, and equally perplexed. Elsewhere, Sam Stosur remains in trouble against Yastremska, with the latter 2-1 up in the second after an extraordinary comeback to win the first 7-5. As for Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, a wildcard in Australia, he\u2019s close to seeing off Martin Klizan in three sets. Nick Kyrgios and Milos Raonic will have to wait. The 18-year-old Dayana Yastremska has clawed back from 2-5 down to steal the first set from Sam Stosur 7-5 at Melbourne Arena. Can the Ukrainian teenager get the job done in the second? Kyrgios is out warming up before meeting Raonic in what is guaranteed to be a feast full of power, if nothing else. The two big-serving players will duel on Melbourne Arena shortly, with Raonic racking up a 234kph serve two years ago in Australia, while Kyrgios rattled a 227kph down court last year. Williams, meanwhile, moves 4-1 up over Buzarnescu in the third set. Venus Williams is powering through the third and final set, racing into a 3-0 lead over Mihaela Buz\u0103rnescu. Williams, unseeded in Melbourne, punished the Romanian\u2019s sloppy service to help herself into pole position. Not so long ago, she was a game away from a straight-sets defeat. Over on court three, the 2014 champion Stan Wawrinka has lost the first set against Ernests Gulbis, while Marco Cecchinato is trying to put another Serb, Filip Krajinovic, to the sword. The Italian took the first two sets and leads 3-1 in the fourth set after being pegged back 6-1 in the third. Philipp Kohlschreiber, the No 32, has beaten Zhe Li in straight sets. Novak Djokovic will trudge out on to Rod Laver shortly, to warmup for his duel with the American qualifier Mitchell Krueger. And the No 1 seed has been speaking about how it has been sad to witness Andy Murray\u2019s from the front row. \u201cIt hurts me as his longtime friend, colleague, rival,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad for me, but for all sport, because Andy is a very respected and likable guy around the locker room,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great champion. He\u2019s a legend of this sport, without a doubt \u2013 multiple Grand Slam winner, two golds from Olympic Games, Davis Cup. He\u2019s had it all. He touched us all definitely. I wish him a painless future in whatever shape or form that is, on or off the court.\u201d Serena made it look easy, but Venus not so much. Williams has clung on take the second set against the No 25 Mihaela Buzarnescu, prospering in a tie-break on Margaret Court. The 38-year-old prevails at the breaker 7-3, and she may yet wriggle out and avoid a first-round exit yet. It looked like game over after she fell a set down and trailing 3-5 in the second but Venus, a two-time former finalist in Melbourne, has hit back in style to take the match to a third set. Meanwhile the sixth seed, Elina Svitolina, has breezed past the Swiss Viktorija Golubic 6-1, 6-2 in just over an hour. As much as it will be difficult to compete with Andy Murray\u2019s aching five-setter \u2013 almost certainly his final bow \u2013 there is plenty of tennis to get stuck into as Novak Djokovic, Simona Halep and pantomime villain Nick Kyrgios all take centre stage. Djokovic faces American qualifier Mitchell Krueger, Halep, the Estonian Kaia Kanepi, while the No 16 seed Milos Raonic awaits a tasty match-up with Mr Kyrgios at the Melbourne Arena. Elsewhere in the night session, Naomi Osaka will do battle with Magda Linette, while Stan Wawrinka is under way against Ernests Gulbis. Dominic Thiem will also attempt to reach round two without breaking sweat, when he takes on Benoit Paire. Some other big-hitters, namely Serena Williams, have already made light work of reaching the second round, though Kei Nishikori did survive a scare, advancing after Polish qualifier Kamil Majchrzak was forced to retire. As for Johanna Konta, she was involved in a marathon three-hour slog, and a tie-breaker victory over Ajla Tomljanovic. \u201cOverall, every aspect of the match was tough,\u201d Konta says. \u201cI played a tough opponent who I lost to recently [in Brisbane] and the first round of Grand Slams are never easy. And the conditions were tough, humid and hot. I\u2019m happy to have stayed with her when she was playing well but also play on my own terms.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An MP found guilty of repeatedly lying to avoid a speeding ticket has until Wednesday afternoon to appeal against her conviction \u2013 a decision that will be closely watched by both Labour and the Conservatives. Fiona Onasanya, a former Labour whip who sits in the Commons as an independent, has been considering whether to try to overturn last month\u2019s Old Bailey verdict for perverting the course of justice, sources said. Associates say she was planning to attend parliament on Tuesday night to vote against Theresa May\u2019s deal for leaving the European Union. Onasanya has pledged to continue as an MP for as long as possible despite being urged by her former Labour colleagues and constituents to stand down. The date for her sentencing has yet to be decided, the Old Bailey said. If she appeals, it would mean that any attempt to remove her from office would be suspended until after the legal process is completed. If Onasanya is sentenced to a year or more in prison, she will automatically lose her seat, according to parliamentary rules. Any custodial or suspended sentence of less than a year that is not appealed against would automatically trigger a recall petition under the Recall of MPs Act 2015. No MP has yet been recalled under the 2015 act. Onasanya\u2019s decision will be watched keenly by both her former party and the Conservatives as they consider whether they need to prepare for a byelection in the seat, which voted to leave the EU. The Conservatives have already chosen a prospective candidate, Paul Bristow, while Labour have begun regularly canvassing the constituency. Barry Gardiner, the shadow international development secretary, joined Labour activists leafleting in the town last weekend. Peterborough voted by 61% to 39% to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum. The former Tory MP, Stewart Jackson, surprisingly lost to Onasanya a year later by 607 votes. A byelection could be held shortly before the UK leaves the EU. The timing of any byelection will depend on when she is sentenced, the length of the sentence and the decision of the local returning officer. Onasanya, a former Labour whip, was accused at the Old Bailey of inventing a series of lies over 17 months to hide the fact that she was driving the car. The solicitor lied \u201cpersistently and deliberately\u201d to officers about who was driving her car in an attempt to avoid penalty points, after the vehicle was recorded at 41mph in a 30mph zone near Thorney, Cambridgeshire. A message sent to other Labour MPs on WhatsApp just after her conviction said this \u201cwas not his end but rather the beginning of the next chapter\u201d of her story, as it was with Jesus. \u201cIn times like these, the natural inclination of believers is to ask God: why? I personally do not, because in my experience the answers are usually far above and beyond my reach. What I do know is that I am in good biblical company, along with Joseph, Moses, Daniel and his three Hebrew friends, who were each found guilty by the courts of their day. \u201cWhile God did not save them from a guilty verdict, he did save them in it and ensured that their greatest days of impact were on the other side of a guilty verdict. Of course, this is equally true of Christ, who was accused and convicted by the courts of his day and yet this was not his end but rather the beginning of the next chapter in his story,\u201d she wrote. The MP has told friends she plans to vote against Theresa may\u2019s deal. \u201cShe has said she will be there,\u201d one said. A spokesman for Onasanya was asked for a comment.",

And I\u2019m going to move, that\u2019s the key.</p> <p>Swapping 30 minutes of sedentary time over the course of a day for half an hour of low-intensity activity reduces the risk of an early death by 17%. Thirty minutes for 17%! That\u2019s got to be worth a little wander, hasn\u2019t it? I\u2019ll start with a visit to my editor, to berate her for commissioning me by email, even though she sits approximately four metres away.</p> <p>My existence is extremely sedentary. I sit \u2013 slouch \u2013 at a desk in front of a screen all day. Then I go home and sit, generally in front of a screen. Sometimes, I work at home and then I often do so \u2013 I\u2019m ashamed to say this \u2013 in bed. There\u2019s nothing in the survey about lying down all day, but I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s good. \u201cSitting is harmful, and is going to increase your risk [of death] no matter how you sit,\u201d said Diaz.</p> <p>Not only am I static, I\u2019m old.

      "bodyText": "Today, I\u2019m standing up in the office. Because Dr Keith Diaz says I\u2019ll die if I don\u2019t get up and move. Who\u2019s he? An expert in behavioural medicine at Columbia University, and the co-author of a study that found that people need to sit less in order to live longer. The study doesn\u2019t specifically talk about standing, it\u2019s about not sitting. The standing-sitting debate is an ongoing one, but I\u2019m going to stand because it\u2019s not sitting. And I\u2019m going to move, that\u2019s the key. Swapping 30 minutes of sedentary time over the course of a day for half an hour of low-intensity activity reduces the risk of an early death by 17%. Thirty minutes for 17%! That\u2019s got to be worth a little wander, hasn\u2019t it? I\u2019ll start with a visit to my editor, to berate her for commissioning me by email, even though she sits approximately four metres away. My existence is extremely sedentary. I sit \u2013 slouch \u2013 at a desk in front of a screen all day. Then I go home and sit, generally in front of a screen. Sometimes, I work at home and then I often do so \u2013 I\u2019m ashamed to say this \u2013 in bed. There\u2019s nothing in the survey about lying down all day, but I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s good. \u201cSitting is harmful, and is going to increase your risk [of death] no matter how you sit,\u201d said Diaz. Not only am I static, I\u2019m old. I\u2019m 53. The Columbia research was of people aged 45 and over. This is about people like me; people in danger. That\u2019s why I\u2019m standing in the office. Yes, it feels a bit daft when everyone else is sitting down. No, I\u2019m not going to make a speech; yeah laugh, but who\u2019s going to die first? The posture and physical ergonomics need fine-tuning. I have got my screen balancing on one pile of books, keyboard on another, mouse on a third. I\u2019m going to find out who\u2019s in charge of desks, and then I\u2019m going to actually physically go and see them about getting one of those proper standy-uppy ones.

I\u2019m not going to pull any punches \u2013 Brexit hurt.\u201d But Hackett said Ford would not leave Europe as General Motors did in 2017, when it sold Opel and Vauxhall to PSA Group, owners of Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn. Volkswagen, meanwhile, has its own issues and sales have been hit by \u201cdieselgate\u201d \u2013 the revelation that VW executives had gamed emission tests by installing illegal software in 11m diesel cars. Both companies have been hit by falling sales of diesel vehicles and by a slowdown in the Chinese market, the world\u2019s largest, where car sales recently fell for the first time in 20 years. Analysts are also expecting the US market to contract over the next two years after several years of growth. Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst for Autotrader, said an alliance would come at a crucial moment for both companies. Both are investing billions in new technology including autonomous vehicles and electric cars. \u201cThe cost of developing these technologies is high and nobody knows when there will be a payoff,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all expense and no clear path to profit.\u201d Ford has earmarked $15bn for electrified and driverless vehicle technology in the coming years and is renovating Detroit\u2019s landmark Michigan Central Station into a \u201cmobility lab\u201d for new car technology.",

They are rarely fun.

While many people criticised Jones for airing his dirty nappies in public, calling him a cruel father and a horrible person (though usually in shorter words), one newspaper reported him as tweeting, in a \u201chilarious\u201d post, that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t change it for the world\u201d. But what he really said was: \u201cThis is where people feel compelled to say \u2018i wouldn\u2019t change it for the world!\u2019 But you know\u2026 Of course I\u2019d reconsider! It\u2019s exhausting! Its banal! It\u2019s like looking after a dog you can\u2019t housetrain.\u201d What these responses have in common is that they deny his right to tell this story. Parents tell us how hard it is all the time \u2013 it\u2019s just that some people really don\u2019t want to hear it.</p> <p>Despite popular wisdom, research shows that having children tends to make people <a href=\"https://epc2014.princeton.edu/papers/140098\" title=\"\">less happy</a>. It\u2019s hardly surprising, since what babies inflict on parents is essentially a prolonged form of torture. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/nov/28/un-condemns-sleep-deprivation-among-us-detainees\" title=\"\">Sleep deprivation</a>, bleeding nipples and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w\" title=\"\">Baby Shark</a> going round and round your head for weeks are all actually banned by the UN. But for some reason, parents are not supposed to admit that all of this is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/09/love-regret-mothers-wish-never-had-children-motherhood\" title=\"\">hard to bear</a>.</p> <p>We know this, though, if we listen. I sometimes see 3am posts on social media from new parents who say, \u201cI am struggling\u2026 This is unbearable\u2026 I can\u2019t cope.\u201d What really shocks me is when other parents jump in to comment: \u201cHa, you don\u2019t know anything yet! Just wait until you have two of them! When they\u2019re teenagers, then you\u2019ll know what unbearable is...\u201d Funnily enough, these are often the same parents who judge the choices of people who don\u2019t have children, and suggest to us that we will regret it. Perhaps people without children do actually have some idea of how hard parenting is. Maybe that\u2019s one reason why we don\u2019t do it. But we can still try to be a bit more supportive of people who do.</p> <p>As a non-parent, I probably can\u2019t truly understand what parents are going through. I have no advice to offer about colic or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/dec/05/health.food\" title=\"\">cabbage leaves</a>, or the unique agony of going back to work or choosing the right school. But I can drop everything to come and do your washing up on a day when everything seems too much. I can fill your freezer with bolognese sauce, or talk to you about something other than shades of baby shit, and if you tell me that sometimes you feel you just can\u2019t cope with that tiny tyrant, I will say \u201cHell no! I couldn\u2019t do it. And I am absolutely in awe of you that you are.\u201d I will also say, having read, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/the-handmaid-s-tale--episode-by-episode\" title=\"\">watched and reread The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</a>, thank you for doing this so that I don\u2019t have to.</p> <p>Frankly, a society that puts so much pressure on people to have children, and then never complain about it, really ought to make life easier for those who willingly sign up to 18 years of hard labour. Research shows that parents are even <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/sex-relationships/parents-less-happy-than-nonparents?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1\" title=\"\">less happy in countries that don\u2019t support them</a>, but that policies such as subsidised childcare and paid leave make the burden a lot easier to bear. Perhaps Tulip Siddiq MP, a member of parliament\u2019s women and equalities select committee, will sort all that out when she gets back from having her caesarean \u2013 which she had to delay so that she could <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46868195\" title=\"\">take part in the Brexit vote this week</a>.</p> <p>The rest of us can do our bit by being less judgy of other people\u2019s choices, and having some sympathy for those who are finding it tough. As Duncan Jones also wrote: \u201cWhat it is, is that it is. &amp; they are mine. Hopefully they turn out OK.\u201d With parents who love them so much that they would go through torture for them, they will probably be fine. But they might do even better if their parents had more support and less criticism.</p> <p>\u2022 Katy Guest is a freelance writer and editor, and a commissioning editor for the publisher Unbound</p>",

He \u201csparked debate\u201d (AKA a social media pile-on) this week with a series of tweets about life with children aged two-and-a-half and nine months. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you something I never see anyone admit,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey are exhausting, frustrating and life-destabilizing. They are rarely fun. Sure, smiles are great, hugs are lovely, but it\u2019s HARD &amp; not obviously a good choice in life.\u201d The reactions to his honesty have been interesting. While many people criticised Jones for airing his dirty nappies in public, calling him a cruel father and a horrible person (though usually in shorter words), one newspaper reported him as tweeting, in a \u201chilarious\u201d post, that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t change it for the world\u201d. But what he really said was: \u201cThis is where people feel compelled to say \u2018i wouldn\u2019t change it for the world!\u2019 But you know\u2026 Of course I\u2019d reconsider! It\u2019s exhausting! Its banal! It\u2019s like looking after a dog you can\u2019t housetrain.\u201d What these responses have in common is that they deny his right to tell this story. Parents tell us how hard it is all the time \u2013 it\u2019s just that some people really don\u2019t want to hear it. Despite popular wisdom, research shows that having children tends to make people less happy. It\u2019s hardly surprising, since what babies inflict on parents is essentially a prolonged form of torture. Sleep deprivation, bleeding nipples and Baby Shark going round and round your head for weeks are all actually banned by the UN. But for some reason, parents are not supposed to admit that all of this is hard to bear. We know this, though, if we listen. I sometimes see 3am posts on social media from new parents who say, \u201cI am struggling\u2026 This is unbearable\u2026 I can\u2019t cope.\u201d What really shocks me is when other parents jump in to comment: \u201cHa, you don\u2019t know anything yet! Just wait until you have two of them! When they\u2019re teenagers, then you\u2019ll know what unbearable is...\u201d Funnily enough, these are often the same parents who judge the choices of people who don\u2019t have children, and suggest to us that we will regret it. Perhaps people without children do actually have some idea of how hard parenting is. Maybe that\u2019s one reason why we don\u2019t do it. But we can still try to be a bit more supportive of people who do. As a non-parent, I probably can\u2019t truly understand what parents are going through. I have no advice to offer about colic or cabbage leaves, or the unique agony of going back to work or choosing the right school. But I can drop everything to come and do your washing up on a day when everything seems too much. I can fill your freezer with bolognese sauce, or talk to you about something other than shades of baby shit, and if you tell me that sometimes you feel you just can\u2019t cope with that tiny tyrant, I will say \u201cHell no! I couldn\u2019t do it. And I am absolutely in awe of you that you are.\u201d I will also say, having read, watched and reread The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, thank you for doing this so that I don\u2019t have to. Frankly, a society that puts so much pressure on people to have children, and then never complain about it, really ought to make life easier for those who willingly sign up to 18 years of hard labour. Research shows that parents are even less happy in countries that don\u2019t support them, but that policies such as subsidised childcare and paid leave make the burden a lot easier to bear. Perhaps Tulip Siddiq MP, a member of parliament\u2019s women and equalities select committee, will sort all that out when she gets back from having her caesarean \u2013 which she had to delay so that she could take part in the Brexit vote this week. The rest of us can do our bit by being less judgy of other people\u2019s choices, and having some sympathy for those who are finding it tough. As Duncan Jones also wrote: \u201cWhat it is, is that it is. &amp; they are mine. Hopefully they turn out OK.\u201d With parents who love them so much that they would go through torture for them, they will probably be fine. But they might do even better if their parents had more support and less criticism. \u2022 Katy Guest is a freelance writer and editor, and a commissioning editor for the publisher Unbound",

Her wardrobe as a 75-year-old \u2013 trench coats, mid-height heels, a chic palette of monochrome and camel set off by the perfect shade of blond \u2013 is remarkably similar to her wardrobe in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/06/belle-de-jour-review-luis-bunuel-catherine-deneuve-erotic-shame\" title=\"\">Belle de Jour</a>, her most famous film, which recently celebrated its 50th birthday. In that film, she wears a black patent trench by Yves Saint Laurent, which is almost identical to the coat she wore to the Saint Laurent show last year.</p> <p>Some icons never go out of style, and Deneuve as S\u00e9verine in Belle de Jour is a fashion lodestar. But right now, her look is more relevant than ever. When Riccardo Tisci made his Burberry debut in September 2018, the very first outfit the Italian designer proposed for this most British of labels was <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2019-ready-to-wear/burberry-prorsum/slideshow/collection#1\" title=\"\">a primly buttoned beige shirt dress</a>, which seemed to refer directly to this most French of movie moments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59d6b6729c7734d4e08ef6b4b62de335f23e9bb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59d6b6729c7734d4e08ef6b4b62de335f23e9bb7/0_74_2023_1213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine Deneuve in Belle de Jour, 1967.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine Deneuve in Belle de Jour, 1967.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Versace\u2019s pre-autumn collection, shown in New York late last year, also seemed to channel the subversive bourgeois chic of S\u00e9verine. <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/pre-fall-2019/versace/slideshow/collection#1\" title=\"\">Kaia Gerber opened that show</a> in glossy, military-style outerwear juxtaposed with a boudoir satin skirt, head to toe in a cafe-culture palette of chestnut and coffee.

Her <a href=\"https://keepitchic.com/2017/09/07/the-deneuve-updo/\" title=\"\">inimitable way with a hair ribbon</a> spawned a modern army of It-girl copycats, who wore tongue-in-chic outsize hair bows by Miu Miu, Alessandra Rich and Emilia Wickstead throughout December\u2019s party season. Even leopard print, which is to this decade\u2019s fashion what the shoulder pad was to the 1980s, leads us back to Deneuve.</p> <p>She has a wardrobe of leopard print coats and silk shirts to rival that of Kate Moss \u2013 and knows instinctively the truth of the mantra that when stuck as to what to wear to a fashion show, leopard will never let you down. But her look is rooted in her partnership with Yves Saint Laurent, who designed her wardrobe for Belle de Jour.</p> <p>Deneuve and Saint Laurent had true fashion chemistry, on screen and in real life. Their style love story will be memorialised next week by an auction at Christie\u2019s in Paris, during haute couture fashion week. It is \u201cnot without a certain sadness\u201d, says Deneuve, that she is selling her wardrobe, prompted by the sale of the home in Normandy where the clothes have been stored for decades.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"712dd3e4c9e3e35aa824ec88773ee9a659138971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/712dd3e4c9e3e35aa824ec88773ee9a659138971/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Effortless chic \u2013 Deneuve through the decades\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Effortless chic \u2013 Deneuve in Yves Saint Lauren through the decades</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty Images &amp; Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1965, a 22-year-old Deneuve was invited to meet the Queen. Unsure of what to wear, she took up the suggestion of her then-husband, David Bailey, to approach Yves Saint Laurent, a rising star in Paris fashion. Saint Laurent \u2013 not yet 30, and not yet established in his own right but working at the house of Christian Dior \u2013 made her a long white crepe de chine dress with red embroidery, which marked \u201cthe start of a long professional collaboration and personal friendship\u201d, Deneuve said recently, recalling how \u201csilent complicity, our crazy laughter and our melancholy\u201d bonded her to a man who \u201conly designed clothes to beautify women\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"75c3735858d42432fbec2eb77e457599869f2880\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75c3735858d42432fbec2eb77e457599869f2880/0_109_1355_1693/800.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine Deneuve in signature leopard print\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine Deneuve in signature leopard print.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was Deneuve who suggested to the Belle de Jour director, Luis Bu\u00f1uel, that Saint Laurent should dress her for the film. The subtle erotic charge of the Saint Laurent-clad S\u00e9verine, which came to epitomise Parisian chic \u2013 and prompted the sale of 200,000 pairs of the mid-height Roger Vivier shoes that Deneuve chose for her character \u2013 are an essential element of the film\u2019s status. When the film celebrated its 50th birthday last year, it was the house of Saint Laurent that hosted the anniversary screening. The Christie\u2019s sale, coming hot on the heels of that anniversary, is set to fuel Deneuve-mania.</p> <p>The metallic gold, velvet-draped evening gown, which Deneuve wore at the 2000 Oscars, where her film <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181530/\" title=\"\">Est-Ouest</a> was nominated in the best foreign film category, is expected to sell for \u20ac2,000-\u20ac3,000. A leopard-print velvet gown with a gilt belt by Yves St Lauren from the autumn/winter 1992 collection is expected to fetch upwards of \u20ac1,000.</p> <p>But for trophy-hunters of Parisian chic, the ultimate prize is, of course, Le Smoking. A custom tuxedo trouser suit made for Deneuve in 1982 could be yours for \u20ac1,000-\u20ac1,500.

      "bodyText": "Paris fashion week isn\u2019t Paris fashion week without a sighting of Catherine Deneuve. In an ever-changing cast of nubile starlets, she is always there. Wearing a black patent-leather peacoat over a black polo neck at the Saint Laurent show, a year ago. Crossing the cobblestones of the Louvre in kitten heels to enter the Louis Vuitton show last September. Five minutes before the show is due to start you will likely find her outside, having a nonchalant cigarette; after it has finished, look backstage amid the gossip and the champagne. Deneuve is a proper film star, which is to say that her on-screen and off-screen glamour have melded into one iconic image. Her wardrobe as a 75-year-old \u2013 trench coats, mid-height heels, a chic palette of monochrome and camel set off by the perfect shade of blond \u2013 is remarkably similar to her wardrobe in Belle de Jour, her most famous film, which recently celebrated its 50th birthday. In that film, she wears a black patent trench by Yves Saint Laurent, which is almost identical to the coat she wore to the Saint Laurent show last year. Some icons never go out of style, and Deneuve as S\u00e9verine in Belle de Jour is a fashion lodestar. But right now, her look is more relevant than ever. When Riccardo Tisci made his Burberry debut in September 2018, the very first outfit the Italian designer proposed for this most British of labels was a primly buttoned beige shirt dress, which seemed to refer directly to this most French of movie moments. Versace\u2019s pre-autumn collection, shown in New York late last year, also seemed to channel the subversive bourgeois chic of S\u00e9verine. Kaia Gerber opened that show in glossy, military-style outerwear juxtaposed with a boudoir satin skirt, head to toe in a cafe-culture palette of chestnut and coffee. (This being Versace, there was a safety pin thrown in for good measure.) Deneuve\u2019s influence on fashion in 2019 is not limited to her Belle de Jour wardrobe. Her inimitable way with a hair ribbon spawned a modern army of It-girl copycats, who wore tongue-in-chic outsize hair bows by Miu Miu, Alessandra Rich and Emilia Wickstead throughout December\u2019s party season. Even leopard print, which is to this decade\u2019s fashion what the shoulder pad was to the 1980s, leads us back to Deneuve. She has a wardrobe of leopard print coats and silk shirts to rival that of Kate Moss \u2013 and knows instinctively the truth of the mantra that when stuck as to what to wear to a fashion show, leopard will never let you down. But her look is rooted in her partnership with Yves Saint Laurent, who designed her wardrobe for Belle de Jour. Deneuve and Saint Laurent had true fashion chemistry, on screen and in real life. Their style love story will be memorialised next week by an auction at Christie\u2019s in Paris, during haute couture fashion week. It is \u201cnot without a certain sadness\u201d, says Deneuve, that she is selling her wardrobe, prompted by the sale of the home in Normandy where the clothes have been stored for decades. In 1965, a 22-year-old Deneuve was invited to meet the Queen. Unsure of what to wear, she took up the suggestion of her then-husband, David Bailey, to approach Yves Saint Laurent, a rising star in Paris fashion. Saint Laurent \u2013 not yet 30, and not yet established in his own right but working at the house of Christian Dior \u2013 made her a long white crepe de chine dress with red embroidery, which marked \u201cthe start of a long professional collaboration and personal friendship\u201d, Deneuve said recently, recalling how \u201csilent complicity, our crazy laughter and our melancholy\u201d bonded her to a man who \u201conly designed clothes to beautify women\u201d. It was Deneuve who suggested to the Belle de Jour director, Luis Bu\u00f1uel, that Saint Laurent should dress her for the film. The subtle erotic charge of the Saint Laurent-clad S\u00e9verine, which came to epitomise Parisian chic \u2013 and prompted the sale of 200,000 pairs of the mid-height Roger Vivier shoes that Deneuve chose for her character \u2013 are an essential element of the film\u2019s status. When the film celebrated its 50th birthday last year, it was the house of Saint Laurent that hosted the anniversary screening. The Christie\u2019s sale, coming hot on the heels of that anniversary, is set to fuel Deneuve-mania. The metallic gold, velvet-draped evening gown, which Deneuve wore at the 2000 Oscars, where her film Est-Ouest was nominated in the best foreign film category, is expected to sell for \u20ac2,000-\u20ac3,000. A leopard-print velvet gown with a gilt belt by Yves St Lauren from the autumn/winter 1992 collection is expected to fetch upwards of \u20ac1,000. But for trophy-hunters of Parisian chic, the ultimate prize is, of course, Le Smoking. A custom tuxedo trouser suit made for Deneuve in 1982 could be yours for \u20ac1,000-\u20ac1,500. Who said you can\u2019t buy style? The auction runs 24-30 January.",

One of top-flight football\u2019s few genuinely warm and gloopy romances has come to an amicable but ultimately sad end.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/14/david-wagner-leaves-huddersfield-manager-mutual-consent\">David Wagner leaves job as Huddersfield manager with the club bottom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI know the term \u2018mutual consent\u2019 is often a byword for the manager being sacked in professional football, but this is a truly joint decision,\u201d said Huddersfield\u2019s chairman, Dean Hoyle, who had repeatedly insisted he would not sack Wagner and reiterated the sentiment in a statement that suggests his relationship with his former manager remains genuinely warm. Who the club will turn to remains to be seen, but what is certain is that the coach in question will have extremely big boots to fill.</p> <p>Wagner was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/05/huddersfield-town-appoint-david-wagner-manager\" title=\"\">appointed in November 2015</a>, with Huddersfield 18th in the Championship having won three league games out of 15. \u201cDavid\u2019s football philosophy is directly in line with ours; he fits for what we need,\u201d said Hoyle at the time of a man who had resigned from his role with Borussia Dortmund\u2019s under-23s one month previously. \u201cHe is the club\u2019s first [head coach] from outside the UK and he brings a new approach and new ideas.\u201d</p> <p>Those ideas took a while to implement and Huddersfield finished 19th that season. However, following a net outlay of less than \u00a33m, they finished fifth in the following campaign and secured one of the more unlikely promotions in living memory through the play-offs. Their fairytale rise was secured by a spot-kick in a shootout against Reading scored by their then \u00a31.8m record signing, Christopher Schindler. In a division where the net spend of a comparatively unsuccessful team such as Aston Villa was around \u00a340m, it crowned an extraordinary achievement. Unwilling to gouge the club\u2019s supporters, Hoyle announced there would be no rise in season-ticket prices.</p> <p>Few gave Huddersfield the proverbial snowball\u2019s chance in hell of staying up and Guardian writers were kinder than most in predicting a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/aug/03/premier-league-2017-18-preview-huddersfield\" title=\"\">finish of 19th</a>. Wagner had turned down more lucrative offers in order to see out the adventure and a raft of new record signings, purchased collectively for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jul/14/kyle-walker-manchester-city-madness-premier-league\" title=\"\">less than the price of a Manchester City full-back</a>, helped secure seven points from the first nine available and lay the foundations for extremely unlikely survival. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/21/huddersfield-town-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">A win over Manchester United</a> was arguably the highlight of their season, before safety was secured with a game to spare courtesy of back-to-back draws at Manchester City and Chelsea. This led to Wagner signing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/30/david-wagner-signs-new-contract-huddersfield-manager\" title=\"\">new three-year deal</a> worth \u00a37.5m, when \u2013 perhaps with the benefit of hindsight \u2013 he might have been better advised considering offers from elsewhere. West Ham, Leicester City and Everton were reported to be interested, while the antennae of several clubs from Germany were also believed to be twitching.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Huddersfield stayed up on their own merits, it\u2019s hardly unfair to say they were helped by the proliferation of comparatively rich but terrible teams swirling around the Premier League plughole. Upon signing his latest deal, Wagner made clear the club had by no means consolidated their position in the top flight. \u201cWe still have a lot of work to do as we adapt to life in the Premier League,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this club and its people have the ambition, desire and attitude to take this challenge on.\u201d</p> <p>The ambition, desire and attitude, certainly. But on the face of all available evidence this season, not the ability. Huddersfield have won two games out of 22, scoring 13 goals. While the effort of Wagner\u2019s players cannot be faulted, and was often praised in defeat by their manager, their inability to score with anything approaching regularity suggests the collective is just not good enough. For every goal they do score, they concede almost three and, eight points adrift of safety, such numbers are simply not sustainable.</p> <p>Following a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/29/fulham-huddersfield-town-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">recent defeat against Fulham</a> their players looked mentally broken, and their most recent match against Cardiff <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/12/cardiff-city-huddersfield-town-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">ended with Wagner embarking on a post-match rant against the referee Lee Mason</a> that was uncharacteristically embittered. It was difficult to avoid the suspicion he knew the jig was up.</p> <p>Beyond almost certain relegation, what the future holds for Huddersfield could scarcely be more unclear. The suddenness of Wagner\u2019s departure suggests a replacement has almost certainly not been lined up, while Sam Allardyce, that noted firefighter and unimaginative bookies\u2019 favourite to take over, has ruled himself out of a job he seems unlikely to have been given by an owner as progressive as Hoyle.</p> <p>For the time being, Mark Hudson has been promoted from his position as under-23 coach to take charge of Sunday\u2019s home match against Manchester City. Baptisms don\u2019t get much more flammable and victory could herald a new chapter in the recent fairytale.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Wagner leaves with his reputation untarnished and will almost certainly find himself in lucrative, gainful employment as soon as he decides he is ready to return.</p>",

One of top-flight football\u2019s few genuinely warm and gloopy romances has come to an amicable but ultimately sad end. \u201cI know the term \u2018mutual consent\u2019 is often a byword for the manager being sacked in professional football, but this is a truly joint decision,\u201d said Huddersfield\u2019s chairman, Dean Hoyle, who had repeatedly insisted he would not sack Wagner and reiterated the sentiment in a statement that suggests his relationship with his former manager remains genuinely warm. Who the club will turn to remains to be seen, but what is certain is that the coach in question will have extremely big boots to fill. Wagner was appointed in November 2015, with Huddersfield 18th in the Championship having won three league games out of 15. \u201cDavid\u2019s football philosophy is directly in line with ours; he fits for what we need,\u201d said Hoyle at the time of a man who had resigned from his role with Borussia Dortmund\u2019s under-23s one month previously. \u201cHe is the club\u2019s first [head coach] from outside the UK and he brings a new approach and new ideas.\u201d Those ideas took a while to implement and Huddersfield finished 19th that season. However, following a net outlay of less than \u00a33m, they finished fifth in the following campaign and secured one of the more unlikely promotions in living memory through the play-offs. Their fairytale rise was secured by a spot-kick in a shootout against Reading scored by their then \u00a31.8m record signing, Christopher Schindler. In a division where the net spend of a comparatively unsuccessful team such as Aston Villa was around \u00a340m, it crowned an extraordinary achievement. Unwilling to gouge the club\u2019s supporters, Hoyle announced there would be no rise in season-ticket prices. Few gave Huddersfield the proverbial snowball\u2019s chance in hell of staying up and Guardian writers were kinder than most in predicting a finish of 19th. Wagner had turned down more lucrative offers in order to see out the adventure and a raft of new record signings, purchased collectively for less than the price of a Manchester City full-back, helped secure seven points from the first nine available and lay the foundations for extremely unlikely survival. A win over Manchester United was arguably the highlight of their season, before safety was secured with a game to spare courtesy of back-to-back draws at Manchester City and Chelsea. This led to Wagner signing a new three-year deal worth \u00a37.5m, when \u2013 perhaps with the benefit of hindsight \u2013 he might have been better advised considering offers from elsewhere. West Ham, Leicester City and Everton were reported to be interested, while the antennae of several clubs from Germany were also believed to be twitching. While Huddersfield stayed up on their own merits, it\u2019s hardly unfair to say they were helped by the proliferation of comparatively rich but terrible teams swirling around the Premier League plughole. Upon signing his latest deal, Wagner made clear the club had by no means consolidated their position in the top flight. \u201cWe still have a lot of work to do as we adapt to life in the Premier League,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this club and its people have the ambition, desire and attitude to take this challenge on.\u201d The ambition, desire and attitude, certainly. But on the face of all available evidence this season, not the ability. Huddersfield have won two games out of 22, scoring 13 goals. While the effort of Wagner\u2019s players cannot be faulted, and was often praised in defeat by their manager, their inability to score with anything approaching regularity suggests the collective is just not good enough. For every goal they do score, they concede almost three and, eight points adrift of safety, such numbers are simply not sustainable. Following a recent defeat against Fulham their players looked mentally broken, and their most recent match against Cardiff ended with Wagner embarking on a post-match rant against the referee Lee Mason that was uncharacteristically embittered. It was difficult to avoid the suspicion he knew the jig was up. Beyond almost certain relegation, what the future holds for Huddersfield could scarcely be more unclear. The suddenness of Wagner\u2019s departure suggests a replacement has almost certainly not been lined up, while Sam Allardyce, that noted firefighter and unimaginative bookies\u2019 favourite to take over, has ruled himself out of a job he seems unlikely to have been given by an owner as progressive as Hoyle. For the time being, Mark Hudson has been promoted from his position as under-23 coach to take charge of Sunday\u2019s home match against Manchester City. Baptisms don\u2019t get much more flammable and victory could herald a new chapter in the recent fairytale. Meanwhile, Wagner leaves with his reputation untarnished and will almost certainly find himself in lucrative, gainful employment as soon as he decides he is ready to return.",

Jared Kushner, still apparently seething over events that had occurred a decade ago.\u201d</p> <p>The political assassination was carried out by Kushner as a personal vendetta, Christie writes, that had its roots in his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/byron-york-the-sordid-case-behind-jared-kushners-grudge-against-chris-christie\">prosecution, as a then federal attorney, of Charles Kushner</a> in 2005. The real estate tycoon was charged with witness tampering and tax evasion and served more than a year in federal prison.</p> <p>Even for a White House that has generated an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/16/fire-fury-fear-wolff-woodward-stormy-daniels-books-donald-trump\">extraordinary cornucopia of hypercritical kiss-and-tell books</a>, Christie\u2019s is exceptional for its excoriating description of events at which he was present. As he points out in Let Me Finish, a copy of which has been obtained by the Guardian before publication on 29 January, none of the other authors \u201chas known Trump for as long or as well as I have \u2013 or was right there in the room when much of this occurred\u201d.</p> <p>It is also exceptional as a chronicle of the score-settling and animosity that drove key decision-making in Trump\u2019s nascent presidency. As political scientists look for the roots of the mayhem in the current White House, the book provides new clues.</p> <p>At the heart of it is Christie\u2019s desire to tell the American people that had his transition plan been adopted after Trump\u2019s shock victory on election night in November 2016, the Trump White House would be a much more effective place today. Once he had been tossed overboard, the new transition team led by Vice President-elect Mike Pence had a \u201cthrown-together approach\u201d that led to appalling choices of senior personnel \u201cover and over again\u201d.</p> <p>But the emotional heart of the book is Christie\u2019s account of the actions of Jared Kushner.

The bizarre plot was an attempt to blackmail the Schulders into keeping their silence about Bill\u2019s knowledge of Charles\u2019s fraudulent activities.</p> <p>Charles Kushner pleaded guilty to 18 charges and served 14 months in a federal prison in Alabama.</p> <p>In one of the most visceral passages of the book, Christie recounts for the first time how Jared Kushner badmouthed him to Trump in April 2016, pleading with his father-in-law not to make Christie transition chairman. Remarkably, he did so while Christie was in the room.</p> <p>\u201cHe implied I had acted unethically and inappropriately but didn\u2019t state one fact to back that up,\u201d Christie writes. \u201cJust a lot of feelings \u2013 very raw feelings that had been simmering for a dozen years.\u201d</p> <p>Kushner went on to tell Trump that it wasn\u2019t fair his father spent so long in prison. He insisted the sex tape and blackmailing was a family matter that should have been kept away from federal authorities: \u201cThis was a family matter, a matter to be handled by the family or by the rabbis.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, in an effort to settle the dispute, proposed a dinner between him, Jared and Charles Kushner, and Christie. Much to Christie\u2019s relief, Jared didn\u2019t acquiesce.</p> <p>In the end, Trump gave Christie the job. But according to Let Me Finish, Kushner had the final say.</p> <p>Let Me Finish bears all the hallmarks of classic, brash Chris Christie. Its language is blunt, caustic and at times self-satisfied, much like his political reputation.</p> <p>It has its lighter moments. At his first meeting with Trump in 2002, at a dinner in the Trump International Hotel and Tower, in New York, Trump ordered his food for him. He chose scallops, to which Christie is allergic, and lamb which he has always detested. Christie recalls wondering whether Trump took him to be \u201cone of his chicks\u201d.</p> <p>At another dinner three years later Trump told the obese Christie he had to lose weight. Addressing him like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/18/trump-in-moscow-what-happened-at-miss-universe-in-2013\">one of the contestants in Miss Universe</a>, the beauty contest organisation that he owned, Trump said \u201cyou gotta look better to be able to win\u201d in politics.</p> <p>Trump returned to the theme of girth during the 2016 presidential campaign, exhorting Christie to wear a longer tie as it would make him look thinner. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Kushner is not the only subject of Christie\u2019s wrath. The author is scathing about Michael Flynn, the retired general who was briefly national security adviser before resigning over his dealings with Russia, and who is now cooperating with the special counsel and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/18/trump-michael-flynn-sentencing-russia-mueller\">awaiting sentencing for lying to the FBI</a>.</p> <p>In one of the book\u2019s more memorable put-downs, Flynn is dubbed \u201cthe Russian lackey and future federal felon\u201d. Christie also calls the former general \u201ca train wreck from beginning to end \u2026 a slow-motion car crash\u201d.</p> <p>However, one central character escapes relatively unscathed: Trump himself. The president is utterly fearless and a unique communicator Christie writes \u2013 and his main flaw is that he speaks on impulse and surrounds himself with people he should not trust.</p> <p>Christie gives a detailed account of his effort to be named as Trump\u2019s vice-presidential running mate in the summer of 2016, after his own bid for the Republican nomination for president failed.

      "bodyText": "Chris Christie, who was ousted as chairman of Donald Trump\u2019s White House transition team in 2016, has written a blistering attack on Jared Kushner, whom he accuses of having carried out a political \u201chit job\u201d on him as an act of revenge for prosecuting his father, Charles Kushner, a decade ago. In his soon to be published book, Let Me Finish, Christie unleashes both barrels on Trump\u2019s son-in-law, who remains a senior White House adviser with responsibilities for Middle Eastern peace, sentencing reform and \u201cAmerican innovation\u201d. Christie blames this key player in the president\u2019s inner circle for his ignominious dismissal shortly after Trump\u2019s election victory in November 2016. Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, writes that Kushner\u2019s role in his sacking was confirmed to him by Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s campaign chief, in real time. As Bannon was carrying out the firing, at Trump Tower in New York, Christie forced him to tell him who was really behind the dismissal by threatening to go to the media and point the finger at Bannon instead. \u201cSteve Bannon \u2026 made clear to me that one person and one person only was responsible for the faceless execution that Steve was now attempting to carry out. Jared Kushner, still apparently seething over events that had occurred a decade ago.\u201d The political assassination was carried out by Kushner as a personal vendetta, Christie writes, that had its roots in his prosecution, as a then federal attorney, of Charles Kushner in 2005. The real estate tycoon was charged with witness tampering and tax evasion and served more than a year in federal prison. Even for a White House that has generated an extraordinary cornucopia of hypercritical kiss-and-tell books, Christie\u2019s is exceptional for its excoriating description of events at which he was present. As he points out in Let Me Finish, a copy of which has been obtained by the Guardian before publication on 29 January, none of the other authors \u201chas known Trump for as long or as well as I have \u2013 or was right there in the room when much of this occurred\u201d. It is also exceptional as a chronicle of the score-settling and animosity that drove key decision-making in Trump\u2019s nascent presidency. As political scientists look for the roots of the mayhem in the current White House, the book provides new clues. At the heart of it is Christie\u2019s desire to tell the American people that had his transition plan been adopted after Trump\u2019s shock victory on election night in November 2016, the Trump White House would be a much more effective place today. Once he had been tossed overboard, the new transition team led by Vice President-elect Mike Pence had a \u201cthrown-together approach\u201d that led to appalling choices of senior personnel \u201cover and over again\u201d. But the emotional heart of the book is Christie\u2019s account of the actions of Jared Kushner. In this telling, Christie was ditched by a young man who made it his business to discredit and denounce him because of what he had done to his father. \u201cThe kid\u2019s been taking an ax to your head with the boss ever since I got here,\u201d Bannon confessed at Christie\u2019s dismissal. Christie was the US attorney in New Jersey when he spearheaded the prosecution of Charles Kushner for witness tampering. The case arose out of a bitter family feud. The elder Kushner hired a sex worker to seduce his brother-in-law Bill Schulder, then filmed them having sex in a motel and sent the tape to his own sister, Esther. The bizarre plot was an attempt to blackmail the Schulders into keeping their silence about Bill\u2019s knowledge of Charles\u2019s fraudulent activities. Charles Kushner pleaded guilty to 18 charges and served 14 months in a federal prison in Alabama. In one of the most visceral passages of the book, Christie recounts for the first time how Jared Kushner badmouthed him to Trump in April 2016, pleading with his father-in-law not to make Christie transition chairman. Remarkably, he did so while Christie was in the room. \u201cHe implied I had acted unethically and inappropriately but didn\u2019t state one fact to back that up,\u201d Christie writes. \u201cJust a lot of feelings \u2013 very raw feelings that had been simmering for a dozen years.\u201d Kushner went on to tell Trump that it wasn\u2019t fair his father spent so long in prison. He insisted the sex tape and blackmailing was a family matter that should have been kept away from federal authorities: \u201cThis was a family matter, a matter to be handled by the family or by the rabbis.\u201d Trump, in an effort to settle the dispute, proposed a dinner between him, Jared and Charles Kushner, and Christie. Much to Christie\u2019s relief, Jared didn\u2019t acquiesce. In the end, Trump gave Christie the job. But according to Let Me Finish, Kushner had the final say. Let Me Finish bears all the hallmarks of classic, brash Chris Christie. Its language is blunt, caustic and at times self-satisfied, much like his political reputation. It has its lighter moments. At his first meeting with Trump in 2002, at a dinner in the Trump International Hotel and Tower, in New York, Trump ordered his food for him. He chose scallops, to which Christie is allergic, and lamb which he has always detested. Christie recalls wondering whether Trump took him to be \u201cone of his chicks\u201d. At another dinner three years later Trump told the obese Christie he had to lose weight. Addressing him like one of the contestants in Miss Universe, the beauty contest organisation that he owned, Trump said \u201cyou gotta look better to be able to win\u201d in politics. Trump returned to the theme of girth during the 2016 presidential campaign, exhorting Christie to wear a longer tie as it would make him look thinner. Meanwhile, Kushner is not the only subject of Christie\u2019s wrath. The author is scathing about Michael Flynn, the retired general who was briefly national security adviser before resigning over his dealings with Russia, and who is now cooperating with the special counsel and awaiting sentencing for lying to the FBI. In one of the book\u2019s more memorable put-downs, Flynn is dubbed \u201cthe Russian lackey and future federal felon\u201d. Christie also calls the former general \u201ca train wreck from beginning to end \u2026 a slow-motion car crash\u201d. However, one central character escapes relatively unscathed: Trump himself. The president is utterly fearless and a unique communicator Christie writes \u2013 and his main flaw is that he speaks on impulse and surrounds himself with people he should not trust. Christie gives a detailed account of his effort to be named as Trump\u2019s vice-presidential running mate in the summer of 2016, after his own bid for the Republican nomination for president failed. He detects yet again the hand of Kushner \u2013 and that of his wife and Trump\u2019s beloved daughter, Ivanka Trump \u2013 working against him. An anonymous \u201chigh-ranking Trump staffer\u201d is depicted calling to warn that \u201cthe family is very upset that he says it will be you\u201d. A mollifying call from son Eric Trump follows but that is as close as Christie gets. Trump chooses ultra-conservative Indiana politician, Mike Pence, after a mystifying wait. Christie repeatedly says he was not disappointed. US attorney general, the other role Christie would have accepted, also eluded him. As with most appointments he is scathing about the man who got the job, Jeff Sessions, whom he calls \u201cnot ready for primetime\u201d and whose recusal from the Russia investigation he blames for its ever-growing scale. Trump did apparently offer Christie \u201cspecial assistant to the president in the White House\u201d, which he turned down, prompting from the president-elect \u201can expression that said maybe he hadn\u2019t heard me right\u201d. Christie would have taken chair of the Republican National Committee and seemed poised to get it. But according to Christie, once again Trump\u2019s family worked against him. In a near-comic scene, Reince Priebus, the RNC chair who would become Trump\u2019s first chief of staff, offers him role after role in a frantic attempt to fulfil the directive from Trump to \u201cmake Chris happy\u201d. One by one, Christie turns down labor secretary, homeland security secretary and ambassadorships in Rome and the Vatican. Christie is relatively forgiving of Kushner in the context of the infamous June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between the candidate\u2019s son-in-law, his son Donald Jr, his campaign manager and a group of Russians, some with Kremlin ties, offering \u201cdirt\u201d on his Democratic presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton. Bannon memorably told the author Michael Wolff the meeting was \u201ctreasonous\u201d but Christie writes that taking the meeting was merely \u201cdumb\u201d or, in the case of Kushner and Trump Jr, a \u201csign of profound inexperience\u201d. He faults Trump\u2019s response to Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into links with Russia, but does not go into detail about the work of the special counsel. He does, however, contend that Kushner misjudged two Russia-related firings: that of Flynn in February 2017 and most famously that of the FBI director James Comey in May the same year.

And there has been recent success growing the game in unexpected cities, such as Raleigh, North Carolina, whose new taxpayer-funded ground played host last September to a World Cup qualifier between USA and Canada.

There\u2019s also a tellingly polite message when you call its office number: \u201cIf this call is concerning an issue you are having trying to join USA cricket, we apologise in advance for the challenges, but greatly appreciate your interest \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Still, there is one avenue that offers an opportunity both to grow and fund the game in the US that remains untried. Football\u2019s popularity in the US has mushroomed because of the women\u2019s game; levels of female participation owe much to the Title IX legislation that requires and guarantees equal access to federally funded sports programmes for men and women. Numerous sports \u2013 from beach volleyball to handball \u2013 have grown their membership by creating college scholarships and attracting programme funding from universities.</p> <p>Women\u2019s cricket, it seems fair to say, was not well cultivated by Usaca: in 2011 the pool of talent it drew from was so small that the women\u2019s squad for their World Cup qualifying matches included two players in their 50s. And while there are now a handful of female leagues in the country, a recent call for try-outs for the national training camps still mustered only around 100 players.</p> <p>Encouragingly, USA Cricket seems keen to tackle the deficit. They have begun conversations with the National Collegiate Athletic Association about the process of turning cricket into an intramural sport (albeit this is not a speedy process), and one of its first acts has been to advertise for a head coach for the women\u2019s team. Perhaps it\u2019s time for the Daughters of the American (Cricketing) Revolution to take the stage.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong><em>This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/sign-up-to-the-spin\" title=\"\"><strong><em>To subscribe, just visit this page and follow the instructions</em></strong></a>.</p>",

There\u2019s also a tellingly polite message when you call its office number: \u201cIf this call is concerning an issue you are having trying to join USA cricket, we apologise in advance for the challenges, but greatly appreciate your interest \u2026\u201d Still, there is one avenue that offers an opportunity both to grow and fund the game in the US that remains untried. Football\u2019s popularity in the US has mushroomed because of the women\u2019s game; levels of female participation owe much to the Title IX legislation that requires and guarantees equal access to federally funded sports programmes for men and women. Numerous sports \u2013 from beach volleyball to handball \u2013 have grown their membership by creating college scholarships and attracting programme funding from universities. Women\u2019s cricket, it seems fair to say, was not well cultivated by Usaca: in 2011 the pool of talent it drew from was so small that the women\u2019s squad for their World Cup qualifying matches included two players in their 50s. And while there are now a handful of female leagues in the country, a recent call for try-outs for the national training camps still mustered only around 100 players. Encouragingly, USA Cricket seems keen to tackle the deficit. They have begun conversations with the National Collegiate Athletic Association about the process of turning cricket into an intramural sport (albeit this is not a speedy process), and one of its first acts has been to advertise for a head coach for the women\u2019s team. Perhaps it\u2019s time for the Daughters of the American (Cricketing) Revolution to take the stage. \u2022 This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.

With parliament all but certain to reject her painstakingly negotiated deal in the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d, Robbins has been helping to scope out options for what happens next. One approach being seriously considered is a period of negotiation that could be overseen by civil servants, with the aim of testing which of up to six options could command a majority in the Commons. \u201cOlly has been on a mission,\u201d said one Whitehall source. It has not yet been decided whether the government would open the door to direct talks with the Labour leadership over what should happen next \u2013 or seek to work through backbench channels, the Guardian understands. Whitehall\u2019s role could reflect that played by senior Cabinet Office civil servants, including the then cabinet secretary, the late Jeremy Heywood, during coalition talks after the 2010 general election, which resulted in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat alliance. MPs could then vote on whatever Brexit plan emerged from the talks as most likely to command majority support \u2013 potentially including the Norway-style approach championed by the former Tory minister Nick Boles. However, it is not expected that the process would consider options that involve reversing the referendum result. May has given little indication even to her cabinet that she is willing to consider alternatives to her plan, and if she lost by a narrow margin could still decide to return to Brussels in a bid to tease out more concessions. Tory backbenchers, and some cabinet ministers, would also be likely to react furiously if May made any direct overtures to Labour. An amendment tabled by the Conservative backbencher Andrew Murrison is aimed at sending a signal to Brussels that MPs will only accept May\u2019s deal with a time-limited backstop. But if it failed to secure much support, it could suggest May\u2019s next step must be more radical than a tweak to the backstop, if she wanted to secure backing for her deal \u2013 and Robbins is helping to examine how she could proceed. May phoned trade union leaders, including Unite\u2019s general secretary, Len McCluskey, last week \u2013 a move that both union sources and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s allies regarded as an attempt to signal a willingness to compromise with Labour. Another source claimed May\u2019s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, had warned the prime minister that a permanent customs union would be the Labour leader\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d for entering talks \u2013 something she remains reluctant to entertain. Government strategists believe Corbyn wants to avoid being forced into supporting a second referendum \u2013 and hope he might seize on the option of helping to shape the Brexit deal instead. Labour sources said they would be wary of entering into any kind of negotiation with the prime minister. Corbyn is likely to press ahead with calling a vote of no confidence in the government immediately if May were defeated on Tuesday night.

      "body": "<p>City versus town? It might seem a facile debate in a small country where the interests of both should be aligned. What\u2019s the difference, apart from size? Quite a lot, actually. For the past few decades, lobbying by a group of large cities has placed big population centres at the forefront of what remains of urban policy. Larger cities were seen as the engines of growth, portrayed as the <a href=\"https://www.centreforcities.org/publication/talk-of-the-town/\" title=\"\">economic saviours for surrounding communities</a>. A contestable point, certainly. But these cities found a welcoming ear in government.</p> <p>The government responded with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/17/liverpool-west-midlands-devolution-deal-northern-powerhouse-government\" title=\"\">devolution deals</a> to create combined authorities, led by mayors, in six city-regions, including Greater Manchester, the West Midlands and Merseyside. But Theresa May went cool on the idea, instead preferring to reinvigorate \u201cBrexit Britain\u201d: those places which voted leave in June 2016.

      "bodyText": "City versus town? It might seem a facile debate in a small country where the interests of both should be aligned. What\u2019s the difference, apart from size? Quite a lot, actually. For the past few decades, lobbying by a group of large cities has placed big population centres at the forefront of what remains of urban policy. Larger cities were seen as the engines of growth, portrayed as the economic saviours for surrounding communities. A contestable point, certainly. But these cities found a welcoming ear in government. The government responded with devolution deals to create combined authorities, led by mayors, in six city-regions, including Greater Manchester, the West Midlands and Merseyside. But Theresa May went cool on the idea, instead preferring to reinvigorate \u201cBrexit Britain\u201d: those places which voted leave in June 2016. The PM even popped into a village up the hill from my Tyneside home to reassure the north (62 of the 73 local authority areas in northern England voted leave) that she was determined to deliver equity across the country: \u201cIt is my mission to make sure that ... no community is left behind as we plan both our domestic agenda and our Brexit strategy,\u201d she said. Domestic agenda? Dream on. Few, if any, policies \u2013 aside, ironically, from EU funding \u2013 are in place to address deep-seated problems such as unemployment, vacant and partly abandoned town centres, and poor housing in these \u201cleft-behind\u201d places that time, and governments, have largely forgotten.

A government spokesman told Society Guardian ministers recognised the importance of reassuring communities on the future of such funding, post-Brexit.

Civil servants speak despairingly of \u201cstrategy stasis\u201d. The state, nationally and locally, has been hollowed out. Swaths of the country are being hammered by the continuing impact of austerity on local councils. Research by economic geographers at Cambridge University underlines how town halls in the poorest parts of England, mainly in the north, have been hit disproportionately by the deepest spending cuts \u2013 with yet more to come \u2013 while the south has generally been treated much more leniently. So much for the PM\u2019s pledge to end austerity.

Researchers at Warwick Business School\u2019s Data Science Lab have developed a \u201cdeep learning\u201d model that can determine what makes a location beautiful, based on a database of 200,000 images of places in the UK that had been rated for their beauty by 1.5 million people on the website ScenicOrNot. The groundbreaking result that meadows and old monuments are nice, while motorways and hospitals are not, doesn\u2019t suggest that we\u2019ll be seeing a future of automated urban planning any time soon. Perhaps aware of the difficulties ahead, Malthouse has said: \u201cIt\u2019s totally critical to our mission of building 300,000 homes that we get this design conversation \u2013 this beauty conversation \u2013 correct.\u201d If parliament is incapable of debating the question with the rigour it deserves, then come and make your voice heard at the alternative public forum. The Fundamentals: Beauty series of public debates will be at Central Saint Martins, London, 24 January to 21 February.",

British viewers may fondly remember BBC sitcoms such as As Time Goes By, starring Judi Dench, or Waiting for God starring Stephanie Cole.

He was way too good tonight. Every time I returned, he served and volleyed. He volleyed unbelievable. He was so composed on big points, he made returns, jag returns on big points on my serve. He was way too good for me tonight.\u201d Kyrgios said he would have beaten 75 percent of the draw on that form. \u201cI think there are players that are much better than I am,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously guys like Roger [Federer] can neutralise big servers so easy with the chip return, which I don\u2019t have. But [I] would have beaten a lot of players, for sure.\u201d Kyrgios said he would be available for Davis Cup selection, playing down suggestions that he did not want to play under Australia captain Lleyton Hewitt. \u201cNot really,\u201d he said, when asked if there was a rift. Bernard Tomic claimed on Tuesday that \u201cno one liked Hewitt\u201d but Kyrgios said he had not even seen his comments. \u201cI don\u2019t have a big deal with anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to play Davis Cup. I love Davis Cup. If I don\u2019t play, I don\u2019t play. I\u2019m available. That\u2019s all I got to say.\u201d With two more Australians making it through to round two, the total of 10 is the equal-best performance by home players in the past 16 years. Though Sam Stosur, Alya Tomljanovic, Daria Gavrilova and Destinee Aiava all lost and Thanasi Kokkinakis retired with a shoulder injury, teenager Alexei Popyrin and Alex Bolt both advanced with their first grand slam wins. World No149 Popyrin, who trains at the Patrick Mouratoglou academy in France, hit 60 winners in his 7-5, 7-6, 6-4 win over Mischa Zverev of Germany while Bolt, ranked 155, upset American Jack Sock 4\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20132, 6\u20132 for his first grand slam win.\u201d",

In reply, Figueiredo posted an email from the France-Brazil House on Instagram about only allowing over-18s into the show. The email was from Thursday \u2013 three days before the performance was scheduled to take place. \u201cIt\u2019s very strange,\u201d he said. On Monday, after \u00c9s Uma Maluca announced they would stage the banned performance in front of the France-Brazil House at 6pm, a crowd of several hundred gathered. Five armed police stood guard to ensure that no nudity took place. The crowd chanted leftist and anti-fascist slogans as they waited for the performance to begin. \u201cArt should never be censored,\u201d said Sebastiana Cesario, 68-year-old chemist, as she waited in the hot sun. \u201cIt is an unnecessary provocation.\u201d",

Which is the other big deal about Good Omens. Perhaps people bought it for the jokes, but my suspicion is that the novel\u2019s gentle humanism and determined irreverence resonate with readers just as much as the one-liners. Pratchett and Gaiman are both capable of good writing \u2013 but more on that next week. For now, please feel free to continue to prove poor old Queenan wrong by posting more of your favourite lines from the book. I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be any shortage.</p>",

Earlier in the day, Berlin denied reports that Angela Merkel had signalled to the prime minister in a recent call that she would engineer a significant concession to ensure victory in a second vote on the deal, should the first fail as expected. A statement from the chancellery claimed the reports had misrepresented the call, and that Merkel had \u201cgiven no assurances beyond those that were discussed in the European council in December\u201d. At that summit the EU\u2019s 27 leaders had merely restated that the customs union envisaged in the backstop, to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, would be temporary. The EU has repeatedly insisted that the deal struck by May is the \u201conly deal\u201d and that there will not be a renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, which Brexiters fear will keep the UK indefinitely trapped in a customs union with the bloc. Speaking in Strasbourg, between plenary sessions of the European parliament, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, on being asked about his message to the British parliament, told reporters: \u201cI would hope that they behave in a responsible way.\u201d The Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, whose country has held the rolling presidency of the EU for the last six months, said the deal being put in front of parliament was a fair compromise. He said: \u201cThe European Union, I believe, in negotiations with the United Kingdom has nothing to reproach itself for because we negotiated a very balanced exit agreement and we also have a political declaration on the future of our relationship. \u201cNow, even if things don\u2019t go our way this evening in the vote in the British parliament and even if the next few weeks and months are rocky it is important that we continue to sing from the same hymn-sheet. We in the council, commission and parliament.\u201d The British prime minister is expected to return to Brussels within 48 hours should her defeat in parliament be manageable, and a possible way forward for the current deal emerges. But Brussels is preparing itself for a request for an extension to the two-year negotiating period from Downing Street in the coming weeks, given the limited time available before Brexit day on 29 March. Leaders of the groups in the European parliament were sceptical on Tuesday about further talks, however. The leader of the Greens, Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian MEP, said: \u201cShe can come back but this reality will not change. This is why giving more time to the UK under article 50 \u2026 will not change the reality. \u201cMore time for a referendum, sure. More time for a general election, sure. More time to think about it, no. The facts are now. Make up your mind ... If the parliament is not able to make up its mind, ask the people.\u201d The socialist group leader, Udo Bullmann, a German MEP, voiced his backing for a second referendum, saying: \u201cWe are deeply convinced that the British people should have the opportunity to assess the situation in one way or another.\u201d. Esteban Gonz\u00e1lez Pons, a Spanish MEP speaking for the largest group in parliament, the centre-right European People\u2019s party, said: \u201cThe EPP is not against the extension of article 50. If the prime minister of the UK were to need more time, then it will certainly not be the EPP group which would oppose granting additional time. But this would need to be additional time denominated in weeks rather than months.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Carol Channing, the American actor who originated the roles of Lorelei Lee in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gentlemen-prefer-blondes\">Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</a> and the eponymous heroine of Hello, Dolly! on Broadway, has died aged 97. Channing died of natural causes after suffering multiple strokes last year, her publicist, Harlan Boll, said.</p> <p>Channing played the matchmaking widow Dolly Levi more than 5,000 times across three Broadway runs from the 1960s to the 1990s and on tours around the world. The part had been turned down by Ethel Merman, but Channing made it her own, donning a hat as feathery as her eyelashes and a red sequinned gown. The musical, based on a Thornton Wilder play and written by Michael Stewart and Jerry Herman, won several Tony awards upon its premiere including best actress in a musical for Channing. She claimed to have missed only one performance as Dolly, after a bout of food poisoning in Kalamazoo, Michigan. When she returned to the role in her mid-70s, in the 1995 revival, the New York Times critic Vincent Canby concluded: \u201cWorld, beware: it\u2019s possible this woman is a substance that should be legally controlled.\u201d</p> <p>A sparkling entertainer with bright eyes, a megawatt smile, a gorgeously gravelly voice and, frequently, a platinum bob wig, Channing was a natural performer. The only child of George Channing, a journalist, and Adelaide (n\u00e9e Glaser), she was born in Seattle in 1921 and loved to sing as a child. Channing excelled at imitating her teachers and fellow students at school in San Francisco (she remained a fine impersonator) and later attended Bennington College in Vermont. She was raised as a Christian Scientist and was entranced by the magic of the theatre when she delivered copies of The Christian Science Monitor newspaper to the stage door of a local playhouse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"570d8bbb67903aac0664ce2fa37dc96179ec876c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/570d8bbb67903aac0664ce2fa37dc96179ec876c/0_0_1980_1984/998.jpg\" alt=\"Donning a hat as feathery as her eyelashes ...

      "bodyText": "Carol Channing, the American actor who originated the roles of Lorelei Lee in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and the eponymous heroine of Hello, Dolly! on Broadway, has died aged 97. Channing died of natural causes after suffering multiple strokes last year, her publicist, Harlan Boll, said. Channing played the matchmaking widow Dolly Levi more than 5,000 times across three Broadway runs from the 1960s to the 1990s and on tours around the world. The part had been turned down by Ethel Merman, but Channing made it her own, donning a hat as feathery as her eyelashes and a red sequinned gown. The musical, based on a Thornton Wilder play and written by Michael Stewart and Jerry Herman, won several Tony awards upon its premiere including best actress in a musical for Channing. She claimed to have missed only one performance as Dolly, after a bout of food poisoning in Kalamazoo, Michigan. When she returned to the role in her mid-70s, in the 1995 revival, the New York Times critic Vincent Canby concluded: \u201cWorld, beware: it\u2019s possible this woman is a substance that should be legally controlled.\u201d A sparkling entertainer with bright eyes, a megawatt smile, a gorgeously gravelly voice and, frequently, a platinum bob wig, Channing was a natural performer. The only child of George Channing, a journalist, and Adelaide (n\u00e9e Glaser), she was born in Seattle in 1921 and loved to sing as a child. Channing excelled at imitating her teachers and fellow students at school in San Francisco (she remained a fine impersonator) and later attended Bennington College in Vermont. She was raised as a Christian Scientist and was entranced by the magic of the theatre when she delivered copies of The Christian Science Monitor newspaper to the stage door of a local playhouse. Inspired by Ethel Waters, she set out to become a performer. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t an inch of the entertainment field I didn\u2019t investigate,\u201d she wrote in her memoir Just Lucky I Guess. \u201cI auditioned for anyone who would look.\u201d She was accepted into the San Francisco Ballet as a teenager, performed comedy at the Borscht Belt summer resorts in upstate New York\u2019s Catskill mountains, and began to get roles on Broadway after understudying Eve Arden in the musical comedy Let\u2019s Face It! co-starring Danny Kaye. Anita Loos, the author of the 1925 comic novel Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, saw her on stage in the satirical revue Lend An Ear and proclaimed: \u201cThere\u2019s my Lorelei.\u201d Channing was swiftly cast in her first leading role as the gleeful, gold-digging Lorelei Lee, the Little Rock flapper who believes diamonds are a girl\u2019s best friend, in the musical based on the novel. After it opened in 1949, she became an instant star and Time magazine put her on its cover. When the musical became a movie in 1953, Marilyn Monroe was given the role of Lorelei. Channing said that No\u00ebl Coward once offered her a role but she turned it down; he later told her she was a \u201csilly ox\u201d for not accepting. But after her run as Lorelei she appeared in more Broadway musicals \u2013 Wonderful Town, The Vamp and Show Girl \u2013 and also had film roles, including the 1956 movie The First Traveling Saleslady, which cast her and a young Clint Eastwood as a couple. It also gave Channing a song, A Corset Can Do a Lot for a Lady. Her most successful film role was as the nightclub singer Muzzy Van Hossmere, fond of quaffing champagne and proclaiming \u201craspberries!\u201d in Thoroughly Modern Millie, which brought her an Oscar nomination in 1968 (she lost to Estelle Parsons for Bonnie and Clyde). Channing was furious to find Barbra Streisand cast in the film version of Hello, Dolly! \u2013 she said it was \u201clike somebody had kidnapped my baby\u201d \u2013 but was glad to play the part over many decades on stage. She also returned to her other signature theatre role in a 1974 Broadway sequel to Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, entitled Lorelei. Following the 30th anniversary tour of Hello, Dolly!, she received a lifetime achievement Tony award in 1995. Her memoir was published in 2002. Channing was married four times and had a son, the cartoonist Channing Lowe.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>The winner: Stan &amp; Ollie</strong></h2> <p>Knocking Mary Poppins Returns off the top of the UK box office rankings after its three-week reign is another slice of nostalgia: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/13/stan-and-ollie-review-steve-coogan-john-c-reilly-laurel-and-hardy\">Stan &amp; Ollie,</a> which focuses on comedy duo Laurel and Hardy towards the end of their performing career. The 1953-set film has debuted with an impressive \u00a32.42m, and \u00a32.58m including previews \u2013 very much at the top end of expectations.</p> <p>Stan &amp; Ollie has plenty of appealing elements, including lead actors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/04/steve-coogan-interview-stan-and-ollie\">Steve Coogan</a> and John C Reilly, and also the broad popularity of its subjects \u2013 and yet voices at UK cinemas were expressing some caution about the film\u2019s commerciality. Having successfully opened the movie, distributor eOne can now be reasonably confident of a warm reception from audiences going forward. The biographical comedy should also play well midweek, connecting to older audiences that have a pattern of cinemagoing on weekdays and in daytime.</p> <p>Stan &amp; Ollie picked up three Bafta nominations last week, including outstanding British film and actor (for Coogan). Coogan was last on the awards trail with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/31/philomena-review\">Philomena in November 2013</a>. That film debuted with \u00a31.51m, including modest previews, on its way to an \u00a311.5m total. Stan &amp; Ollie has arrived in a competitive period for awards contenders, but should nevertheless push past the Philomena lifetime number.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdcBNrjc3wo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MdcBNrjc3wo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2><strong>The runner-up: The Favourite</strong></h2> <p>Distributor 20th Century Fox accomplished a successful launch for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/30/the-favourite-review-olivia-colman-yorgos-lanthimos\">The Favourite</a> when the film opened in the UK with \u00a32.2m for the weekend period and \u00a33.97m including generous previews. But would this provocative dark period comedy-drama from maverick Greek director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/09/yorgos-lanthimos-the-favourite-interview\">Yorgos Lanthimos</a> prove broadly appealing enough to maintain the momentum?</p> <p>Now we have an answer. For its second weekend of play, The Favourite rose by 9% at the box office, albeit boosted by an expansion in the number of cinemas from 538 to 617. Given that films typically decline at a rate of around 40% per week, the outcome for The Favourite is very encouraging. Gross after two weekends is \u00a38.3m.</p> <p>For comparison, a year ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/12/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-review-frances-mcdormand\">Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri</a> grossed \u00a31.62m on its second weekend, declining 25% from its opening session. The total after two weekends was \u00a35.23m. Martin McDonagh\u2019s film ended up on \u00a315.2m, buoyed by five Bafta wins plus Oscars for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/17/frances-mcdormand-two-defining-roles-two-decades-apart\">Frances McDormand</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/05/sam-rockwell-wins-best-supporting-actor-for-three-billboards-at-oscars-2018\">Sam Rockwell</a>. The Favourite led the Bafta nominations last week, with 12 nominations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c3b71904b675bb1bb02b66499d4e9384230160a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c3b71904b675bb1bb02b66499d4e9384230160a/391_335_1108_665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Stone and Olivia Colman in The Favourite.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Stone and Olivia Colman in The Favourite.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox Searchlight</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The rival: Colette</strong></h2> <p>With audiences flocking to awards contenders Stan &amp; Ollie and The Favourite, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/09/colette-review-keria-knightley-dominic-west-wash-westmoreland\">Colette</a> might have been squeezed out of the market \u2013 losing the battle for screen space and the attention of audiences. So Lionsgate should be fairly relieved to see the film debut with a decent \u00a3561,000 from 321 cinemas, and \u00a3788,000 including previews. Keira Knightley stars as the titular French author, opposite Dominic West as her publisher husband who published her novels under his name in turn-of-the-20th-century Paris.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnTNgZz4Sm0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JnTNgZz4Sm0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2><strong>The flop: The Front Runner</strong></h2> <p>While the market was able to accommodate three awards-season contenders, it predictably rejected the fourth: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/12/the-front-runner-review-hugh-jackman-gary-hart-biopic\">Jason Reitman\u2019s The Front Runner</a>, starring Hugh Jackman as Democratic Presidential hopeful Gary Hart. Films about US politicians can be a tough sell in the UK, and The Front Runner didn\u2019t earn enough reviews that communicated must-see cachet. The Sony release debuted with a poor \u00a365,000 from 142 cinemas, and \u00a388,000 including previews.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3Rl2XZC0II\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H3Rl2XZC0II?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2><strong>The revival: Bohemian Rhapsody</strong></h2> <p>The arrival of the sing-along Bohemian Rhapsody powered weekend takings for the title to just above \u00a31m \u2013 returning to a level of success last experienced by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/23/bohemian-rhapsody-review-freddie-mercury-biopic-bites-the-dust\">Freddie Mercury biopic</a> in early December. Weekend box office has been on the rise since Christmas, and takings spiked by another 37% at the weekend.

      "bodyText": "The winner: Stan &amp; Ollie Knocking Mary Poppins Returns off the top of the UK box office rankings after its three-week reign is another slice of nostalgia: Stan &amp; Ollie, which focuses on comedy duo Laurel and Hardy towards the end of their performing career. The 1953-set film has debuted with an impressive \u00a32.42m, and \u00a32.58m including previews \u2013 very much at the top end of expectations. Stan &amp; Ollie has plenty of appealing elements, including lead actors Steve Coogan and John C Reilly, and also the broad popularity of its subjects \u2013 and yet voices at UK cinemas were expressing some caution about the film\u2019s commerciality. Having successfully opened the movie, distributor eOne can now be reasonably confident of a warm reception from audiences going forward. The biographical comedy should also play well midweek, connecting to older audiences that have a pattern of cinemagoing on weekdays and in daytime. Stan &amp; Ollie picked up three Bafta nominations last week, including outstanding British film and actor (for Coogan). Coogan was last on the awards trail with Philomena in November 2013. That film debuted with \u00a31.51m, including modest previews, on its way to an \u00a311.5m total. Stan &amp; Ollie has arrived in a competitive period for awards contenders, but should nevertheless push past the Philomena lifetime number. The runner-up: The Favourite Distributor 20th Century Fox accomplished a successful launch for The Favourite when the film opened in the UK with \u00a32.2m for the weekend period and \u00a33.97m including generous previews. But would this provocative dark period comedy-drama from maverick Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos prove broadly appealing enough to maintain the momentum? Now we have an answer. For its second weekend of play, The Favourite rose by 9% at the box office, albeit boosted by an expansion in the number of cinemas from 538 to 617. Given that films typically decline at a rate of around 40% per week, the outcome for The Favourite is very encouraging. Gross after two weekends is \u00a38.3m. For comparison, a year ago Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri grossed \u00a31.62m on its second weekend, declining 25% from its opening session. The total after two weekends was \u00a35.23m. Martin McDonagh\u2019s film ended up on \u00a315.2m, buoyed by five Bafta wins plus Oscars for Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. The Favourite led the Bafta nominations last week, with 12 nominations. The rival: Colette With audiences flocking to awards contenders Stan &amp; Ollie and The Favourite, Colette might have been squeezed out of the market \u2013 losing the battle for screen space and the attention of audiences. So Lionsgate should be fairly relieved to see the film debut with a decent \u00a3561,000 from 321 cinemas, and \u00a3788,000 including previews. Keira Knightley stars as the titular French author, opposite Dominic West as her publisher husband who published her novels under his name in turn-of-the-20th-century Paris. The flop: The Front Runner While the market was able to accommodate three awards-season contenders, it predictably rejected the fourth: Jason Reitman\u2019s The Front Runner, starring Hugh Jackman as Democratic Presidential hopeful Gary Hart. Films about US politicians can be a tough sell in the UK, and The Front Runner didn\u2019t earn enough reviews that communicated must-see cachet. The Sony release debuted with a poor \u00a365,000 from 142 cinemas, and \u00a388,000 including previews. The revival: Bohemian Rhapsody The arrival of the sing-along Bohemian Rhapsody powered weekend takings for the title to just above \u00a31m \u2013 returning to a level of success last experienced by the Freddie Mercury biopic in early December. Weekend box office has been on the rise since Christmas, and takings spiked by another 37% at the weekend. Total is a stunning \u00a350m after 12 weeks. The market Despite the success of Stan &amp; Ollie and the strong hold for The Favourite, takings overall are 20% down on the equivalent weekend from 2018, which was led by Darkest Hour and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. So although the awards season titles are doing better than expected this year, the studio franchise films \u2013 such as Aquaman and Bumblebee \u2013 are not quite as broadly appealing as their 2018 equivalents. Multiplex cinema operators have hopes pinned on M Night Shyamalan\u2019s Glass, which is a sequel to both Unbreakable and Split. Awards contenders Mary Queen of Scots and Beautiful Boy likewise join the fray, competing for audiences looking to experience an annual awards season cinemagoing binge. Top 10 films 11-13 January 1.

      "body": "<p>Ishy Din is a former Middlesbrough taxi-driver on a mission to record the male immigrant experience. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/mar/01/snookered-review\">Snookered</a> (2012), he dealt with the aspirations of young Pakistanis. His new play, set in a scruffy minicab office, focuses on the impact of deindustrialisation on an older generation and, while the piece has an obvious authenticity, its arguments are signposted with excessive zeal.</p> <p>Din frames the action very deliberately with the death and funeral of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\">Margaret Thatcher</a> in April 2013, and it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/09/opinion-sharply-divide-margaret-thatcher\">her legacy</a> that the play explores. Mansha, the 55-year-old manager of the struggling cab firm, is an honourable man who once had a good job in a now-defunct Teesside steel factory. Raf, the firm\u2019s owner, is his exact contemporary and supposedly oldest friend. The gulf between them is exposed when Mansha greets news of Thatcher\u2019s death with the word \u201cbitch\u201d, while Raf enthusiastically endorses her arguments about radical change. But the crisis comes when Raf announces his plan to sell the firm to a rival company and Mansha is left, with the aid of his son-in-law and a female driver, trying to raise a matching \u00a3120,000 to buy the business.</p> <p>It is hardly Din\u2019s fault that two productions have recently explored similar themes to his own. A revival of Pinter\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jan/06/pinter-five-and-six-review-starry-cast-bring-shorter-works-into-the-spotlight\">Victoria Station</a> exposed the eerie relationship between cab-managers and their radio-controlled drivers. More to the point, Lynn Nottage\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/dec/20/sweat-review-donmar-warehouse-lynn-nottage\">Sweat</a> at the Donmar shows how deindustrialisation destroys communities and divides friends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60533f03eddb1610effd729794181f2d1d85a09d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60533f03eddb1610effd729794181f2d1d85a09d/0_363_5950_3570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karan Gill (Shazad), Rina Fatania (Sameena) and Kammy Darweish (Mansha) in Approaching Empty\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Authenticity ... from left, Karan Gill (Shazad), Rina Fatania (Sameena) and Kammy Darweish (Mansha) in Approaching Empty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Murray</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, whereas Nottage makes you believe in the former bonds, I found it hard to believe that Din\u2019s central couple were ever buddies.

      "bodyText": "Ishy Din is a former Middlesbrough taxi-driver on a mission to record the male immigrant experience. In Snookered (2012), he dealt with the aspirations of young Pakistanis. His new play, set in a scruffy minicab office, focuses on the impact of deindustrialisation on an older generation and, while the piece has an obvious authenticity, its arguments are signposted with excessive zeal. Din frames the action very deliberately with the death and funeral of Margaret Thatcher in April 2013, and it is her legacy that the play explores. Mansha, the 55-year-old manager of the struggling cab firm, is an honourable man who once had a good job in a now-defunct Teesside steel factory. Raf, the firm\u2019s owner, is his exact contemporary and supposedly oldest friend. The gulf between them is exposed when Mansha greets news of Thatcher\u2019s death with the word \u201cbitch\u201d, while Raf enthusiastically endorses her arguments about radical change. But the crisis comes when Raf announces his plan to sell the firm to a rival company and Mansha is left, with the aid of his son-in-law and a female driver, trying to raise a matching \u00a3120,000 to buy the business. It is hardly Din\u2019s fault that two productions have recently explored similar themes to his own. A revival of Pinter\u2019s Victoria Station exposed the eerie relationship between cab-managers and their radio-controlled drivers. More to the point, Lynn Nottage\u2019s Sweat at the Donmar shows how deindustrialisation destroys communities and divides friends. But, whereas Nottage makes you believe in the former bonds, I found it hard to believe that Din\u2019s central couple were ever buddies. They talk of shared experiences, such as seeing their first movies when they arrived from Pakistan as teenagers, but otherwise have nothing in common. Mansha talks of honour and family while Raf seems ready, at one point, to sacrifice his son to save his own skin. You wonder why it took Thatcher\u2019s death to alert Mansha to his chum\u2019s ruthlessness. Din has more success in charting economic truths. We learn the exact amount of capital Mansha\u2019s son-in-law acquires from compensation paid to his late dad for damaged lungs and how much the driver, Sameena, expects to gain from the sale of her parents\u2019 property. Din also suggests that the real money in Britain\u2019s equivalent of the rust belt often comes from drug-dealing: he contrasts that with a halcyon past as Mansha describes the pride he and his fellow workers took in seeing the bridges they helped build spanning the globe. I suspect things weren\u2019t ever as rosy as Mansha makes them seem but you get the point. Pooja Ghai\u2019s production, jointly presented by Tamasha, Kiln and Live theatre, Newcastle, is also decently acted. Kammy Darweish catches Mansha\u2019s mix of naivety and virtue and Nicholas Khan suggests Raf has been debauched by the greed-is-good philosophy. There is firm support from Nicholas Prasad as the son-in-law who also rises and from Rina Fatania as the abrasive cabbie of whom one would like to see more.

But she found the strength to support him in his final years when she joined a friendly choir in Bracknell, Berkshire. \u201cWhen you are caring for somebody and you know there is going to be an end point, it\u2019s a lonely place to be,\u201d says 73-year-old Shaw, her voice faltering slightly. \u201cBut whenever I go to the choir, I feel lifted. The people and songs fill me with joy.\u201d The choir that helped Shaw is featured on Bracknell Forest council\u2019s innovative online community map, which matches lonely and isolated individuals with more than 400 clubs offering everything from chess to gardening. It is just one example of how councils and charities across the country are using technology to address an epidemic of loneliness, which in 2018 led prime minister Theresa May to appoint the world\u2019s first minister for loneliness and unveil a \u00a320m fund. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates one in 20 adults in England feel lonely often or always, with experts pointing to a range of factors, including more people living alone and online services replacing traditional face-to-face activities such as shopping. Bracknell\u2019s map \u2013 which has been painstakingly built by scouring church halls and community centres for small, often informal clubs, societies and activities \u2013 has enabled thousands of people to make new friends in local clubs. Last year 4,221 people visited the map, while Bracknell\u2019s public health team has actively supported nearly 100 individuals referred by GPs and other health care professionals to find a group since June.

This was the result that we expected to see in the first match: a target under 300 on a good batting pitch against the best chasers in the world. <br></p> <p>That first game, Australia took three wickets with four runs on the board to gain the advantage. But Virat Kohli averages 69 in ODI run chases, and 99 in winning run chases. Relying on getting him out in single figures isn\u2019t a viable strategy.</p> <p>This time, things went more as expected. Dhawan gave the innings the early boost, Rohit Sharma bridged things after Dhawan left, and by the time Rohit was out, Kohli was ready to go. He went on to his 39th century in the format \u2013 absurdly \u2013 and when he left, Dhoni was ready to take over. He turned a very slow start into a run-a-ball winning contribution, with key support from Dinesh Karthik.</p> <p>Tonight, Australia\u2019s bowlers couldn\u2019t get any purchase. Stoinis and Maxwell bowled decently in a holding capacity, while Lyon and Richardson didn\u2019t give too much away, but wicket-taking deliveries were too few as the batsmen kept control.</p> <p>We should credit India\u2019s bowlers with the win as much as the batsmen. Bhuvneshwar Kumar dragged Australia back late in the first innings, taking late wickets to pull them from 283-6 to 298-9.</p> <p>When Marsh and Maxwell were batting together, 320 or more was on the cards. But when Bhuvi got them both within an over, Australia\u2019s tail was exposed as lacking much ability with the bat. Nathan Lyon added a dozen handy late runs, which nearly made the difference. <br></p> <p>Marsh played the central role to perfection, with his fourth ton in eight ODI innings, while Maxwell\u2019s fast 48 helped boost the total. But again, perhaps a lack of firepower aside from Maxwell held the score back from where it needed to be. Anyone who thought the first match proved Australia had the balance right may have to reassess.</p> <p>We\u2019ll have the tiebreaker of this series in Melbourne on Friday night, and Adam and I will be with you once again for that. Looking forward to it. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/15/virat-kohli-and-ms-dhoni-fire-india-to-series-levelling-win-over-australia\">Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni fire India to series-levelling win over Australia</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-15T11:36:59.829Z\">at 11.36am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c3dc05ce4b0649df24d1ce7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-15T11:14:52.514Z\">11.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">India win with four balls to spare!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>49.2 overs: India 299-4 (Dhoni 55, Karthik 25)</strong></p> <p><strong>Dhoni goes all the way downtown for six! </strong>Behrendorff the bowler, but first ball of his over Dhoni gets under and pumps it over long-on to level the scores (and raise his fifty).

What a fantastic way to finish, the veteran keeping his head, taking responsibility and sticking the landing. He walks off unbeaten with 12 from five.</p> <p>All told, a fine total from the hosts after such a poor start. When Shaun Marsh walked in as Carey departed, the score was 26-2 in the 8th, and there he was until almost the very end, making a flawless 131 from 123 in the extreme heat. <br></p> <p>It was the West Australian\u2019s fourth ODI ton in his last eight innings, and seventh in this format overall. There is no doubting his importance to this Australian 50-over side heading into a World Cup campaign starting in just 137 days from now. </p> <p>He took the lead in partnerships with Khawaja, Hanscomb and Stoinis, who all fell in the 20s, before Maxwell helped him tick up into top gear, the Victorian making 48 in 37 balls as Marsh cleared the rope three times after passing 100. <br></p> <p>If they can keep India under 299 in their 50 overs, they will win the series. Simple as that! But can they get Kohli early again? All the focus now turns to the Australian bowlers. For that, I\u2019ll hand over to Geoff Lemon.

      "bodyText": "Australia in Sydney, India in Adelaide. This was the result that we expected to see in the first match: a target under 300 on a good batting pitch against the best chasers in the world. That first game, Australia took three wickets with four runs on the board to gain the advantage. But Virat Kohli averages 69 in ODI run chases, and 99 in winning run chases. Relying on getting him out in single figures isn\u2019t a viable strategy. This time, things went more as expected. Dhawan gave the innings the early boost, Rohit Sharma bridged things after Dhawan left, and by the time Rohit was out, Kohli was ready to go. He went on to his 39th century in the format \u2013 absurdly \u2013 and when he left, Dhoni was ready to take over. He turned a very slow start into a run-a-ball winning contribution, with key support from Dinesh Karthik. Tonight, Australia\u2019s bowlers couldn\u2019t get any purchase. Stoinis and Maxwell bowled decently in a holding capacity, while Lyon and Richardson didn\u2019t give too much away, but wicket-taking deliveries were too few as the batsmen kept control. We should credit India\u2019s bowlers with the win as much as the batsmen. Bhuvneshwar Kumar dragged Australia back late in the first innings, taking late wickets to pull them from 283-6 to 298-9. When Marsh and Maxwell were batting together, 320 or more was on the cards. But when Bhuvi got them both within an over, Australia\u2019s tail was exposed as lacking much ability with the bat. Nathan Lyon added a dozen handy late runs, which nearly made the difference. Marsh played the central role to perfection, with his fourth ton in eight ODI innings, while Maxwell\u2019s fast 48 helped boost the total. But again, perhaps a lack of firepower aside from Maxwell held the score back from where it needed to be. Anyone who thought the first match proved Australia had the balance right may have to reassess. We\u2019ll have the tiebreaker of this series in Melbourne on Friday night, and Adam and I will be with you once again for that. Looking forward to it. 49.2 overs: India 299-4 (Dhoni 55, Karthik 25) Dhoni goes all the way downtown for six! Behrendorff the bowler, but first ball of his over Dhoni gets under and pumps it over long-on to level the scores (and raise his fifty). The field comes in, but he just plays tip-and-run to mid-on and bets they\u2019ll miss the stumps. Which is exactly what happens. How cool was that finish? MS Dhoni igniting the crowd. What was his strike rate again? Um, 55 off 54 if you must know. Everyone who said he was finished will be getting torched right about now. Personally, of course I was just making other people\u2019s views know. In a facilitation capacity. You understand. 49th over: India 292-4 (Dhoni 48, Karthik 25) Stoinis with the penultimate. Dhoni is happy to knock a single. Karthik manufactures two through cover. They\u2019re very calm about making up the gap. The twos can do it without the need for a boundary. Two more singles follow. The equation is 11 off 8. Stoinis. To Karthik. Who walks across his stumps and laps past fine leg! Behrendorff sprints around. Dives. Saves it! Throws back in, but minutes after slumping to the ground, Dhoni has sprinted a third run. Outstanding. Now he\u2019s on strike, after taking a moment to compose himself. Pretending to be very interested in the field to give himself time to catch his breath. And uncontrolled, Dhoni hits aerially down the ground despite long on being back, but hits it badly enough that it doesn\u2019t carry. The 50 partnership arrives, and it will carry India to a win. They only need 7 from the last over. There\u2019s a break while Dhoni has a quiet vomit in front of several thousand people. He ended up flat on his back at the end of that over, then rolled over to retch. \u201cHe\u2019s having a Chris Mew!\u201d says Adam Collins next to me. What a rich turn of phrase. The physio comes out to give him some fizzy hydration. It must be very hot for the batsmen still. Criticise his strike rate now... 48th over: India 283-4 (Dhoni 45, Karthik 19) Behrendorff with the job ahead of him. Single from the first ball, single from the second, smacked straight at the leg-side sweepers. Third ball, Dhoni is trying to drop the ball in front of midwicket and run two, but gets too much of it. Karthik drives past cover for one more. All well and good for Behrendorff, but Dhoni gets the soft touch he wants on the fifth ball. More glove than bat, I think, so it rolled past the keeper, and some outstanding running means that India\u2019s total profits by three. Then Karthik hits the midwicket gap flush enough to belt back for a second. The gap closes: 16 needed off 12. 47th over: India 274-4 (Dhoni 40, Karthik 15) Oin and Gloin achieved an unlikely victory: can Stoin do the same? The dot ball that starts his over is gold. Dhoni gets a run from the next but bails out on the second run. The pair do bolt two as Karthik punches a bit wider of the sweeper. Karthik keeps strike. So why would you bowl him that? A short ball, just after he\u2019s destroyed the last one he received, and he gets under this one to send it over backward square for four. Two more tugged wide of long on as Karthik does his part. Eight runs for him from the over, one for Dhoni. India need 25 from 18. 46th over: India 265-4 (Dhoni 39, Karthik 7) Big pressure now on Wheels Richardson. Thumps Dhoni in the thigh and concedes an extra. DK gives the strike back immediately. Knows his job for now. But Dhoni ticks behind square for another single, so Karthik goes the same way for four! Short, pulled, and the gap was hit. Three sweepers on the leg side, so he dinks into all that space for another single. Wheels goes flat. Trying to cramp Dhoni, he bowls a wide instead, before Dhoni keeps strike off the added delivery. They only need 34 in 24 now. This guy wrote a book on Dhoni, so he\u2019d know. 45th over: India 255-4 (Dhoni 37, Karthik 1) Nathan Lyon is handed the ball. MS Dhoni immediately has the runner come out and collect his helmet. Batting bareheaded under lights. He\u2019s not lost any of his style. Is he finished as a finisher. Lyon bowls. Bazinga! All the way over deep midwicket for six! That was great American food. That was 300 hamburgers. The six came after a two worked to leg, and before another two is smacked through cover. A single to finish and keep strike. The over is worth 11, and India need 44 in 30. 44th over: India 244-4 (Dhoni 26, Karthik 1) Dinesh Karthik gets moving immediately with a single. Dhoni looks like he\u2019s shaping for a helicopter but ends up glancing a ball that was straighter than anticipated. Brian Withington is writing eloquently, movingly to my email. \u201cYour description of the Rayudu innings has invoked painful memories of my worst ever knock. It was like a waking nightmare without end. Due to a logistical conundrum (student digs in Oxford, opposition in Cambridge, girlfriend in Colchester) I had to play in hastily borrowed kit including oversized clown trousers and scruffy trainers. Refused to go out for toss in said kit so sent out smirking colleague with instructions to win it or not come back. Opened batting and middled nothing for nearly two hours - skied, edged or spliced everything but just couldn\u2019t get out. Bastard teammates applauded the gruesome 50 like I was Bradman. Truly horrible, soul gnawing stuff. Memory had lain dormant for forty years.\u201d Hello! Cat, meet pigeons. They\u2019re playing the singles-doubles game, not in a tennis sense, but then Kohli goes for something bigger. A big whip off the pads, but I fancy he was aiming square and instead it\u2019s been dragged well in front. Aerial but flat, and Maxwell has time to intercept the projectile. Now things get difficult for India! And the gap that Kohli was going to make up has to be bridged by someone else. Does Dhoni have the capacity to get things moving? Can Dinesh Karthik do so quickly enough? They need 57 from 38. This has nothing to do with anything, but I like this dog\u2019s face. And its name is Mungo. 43rd over: India 238-3 (Kohli 103, Dhoni 22) That is ODI century number 39 for Virat Kohli. There\u2019s a huge gap on the leg side, so it\u2019s simple for him to fend a short ball into it, and belt back for a second run as deep midwicket runs in. The only human with more one-day hundreds is Sachin Tendulkar with 49. At recent rates, Kohli could catch him within a year. Siddle follows up that august moment with a mutant wide that will have to live a vigilante life maligned by society. Dhoni dinks the next ball to long-on, and when the man is slow coming in, they dart back for a second. Single, single, another brace for Dhoni. He\u2019s 22 off 32, and trending upward. 61 needed from 42 balls. Drinks break. 42nd over: India 228-3 (Kohli 99, Dhoni 17) Kohli does often slow up or get twitchy as he approaches a hundred. And with Dhoni also battling, it\u2019s derailed the momentum of this chase. If a wicket fell here, India would be struggling. The psychology of the game. Kohli needs to take control back. But he\u2019s blocked up by Richardson, twice playing straight to Maxwell at backward point, once going over him with a leading edge from a stroke aimed at midwicket. Dhoni gives him strike back. Kohli pulls to long on for a single to close the over, moving to 99 and keeping the strike. Target is 71 in 48. 41st over: India 224-3 (Kohli 97, Dhoni 16) He\u2019s decided it\u2019s time to go. Dhoni walks at Siddle and hoicks at a pull shot. High top edge, and it\u2019s nearly held at deep backward as Behrendorff ran around from long leg. Couldn\u2019t quite get there. Two runs result. They trade singles, and are helped when Siddle is twice pinged for bouncers ruled as wides. The second of those especially looked very harsh. I love the fact that even when he\u2019s annoyed, Siddle just gives a beaming smile. \u201cWide?\u201d he smiles at the umpire, teeth like high-beam headlights. He just loves life. The over costs eight, despite no batsman playing a dominant shot. They need 75 in 54. 40th over: India 216-3 (Kohli 95, Dhoni 12) This byplay between Stoinis and Kohli is interesting. Again Kohli takes three balls to beat the field for a single. But then Dhoni blocks, ducks a short ball, and punches to the bowler. They need 83 off 60, and he\u2019s 12 off 24. He\u2019s a perplexing cricketer. 39th over: India 215-3 (Kohli 94, Dhoni 12) Richardson trying to skid something through, but they work him comfortably enough. Ones and twos, six from the over. Dhoni makes sure he belts back for two from the last ball to give Kohli the strike. Dhoni is 12 from 21 balls. Our friend Ben Jones can\u2019t help himself. He\u2019s a Pant man. 38th over: India 209-3 (Kohli 91, Dhoni 9) Again Stoinis has some minor success: has Kohli strike twice straight to the field, then have to drag a pull to find a run. Once Kohli gets the strike back, Stoinis zips through him and hits his pad. But there\u2019s one ball left in the over, and sometimes that\u2019s all Kohli needs. It\u2019s just a touch wide, and despite being close to the body, Kohli has the timing to cut it for four. He\u2019s into the 90s. 37th over: India 203-3 (Kohli 86, Dhoni 8) Walks at Lyon and lofts him for six! Clean and clear, no apparent muscle in the shot, just timing as Kohli dings the sight screen. Then skips back and cuts hard to deep point, and only some excellent work from Handscomb again keeps him to two. No matter, he\u2019ll take two to midwicket to top up. And one more to keep the strike. Kohli is getting some help from the dressing room at the end of that over; it\u2019s still about 35 degrees out there. and hard work running up and down the pitch. 36th over: India 192-3 (Kohli 75, Dhoni 8) Marcus Stoinis tightens things up a tad, banging the ball in at Kohli\u2019s hip and causing him to miss a couple. But Kohli escapes eventually, and Dhoni biffs two runs through cover. Added to a couple of leg byes, still a decent over. 35th over: India 187-3 (Kohli 74, Dhoni 6) Maxwell has done a job, 1 for 16 from his four overs, but now the stud off-spinner is back. Kohli advances smoothly to drive and move to 69. Nice. Dhoni gets a single immediately, which is what India need. Kohli sees width, and chases the ball with an open face and guides it for four, before turning another ball square for one. This looks so easy. Getting 112 from 90 would have sounded fiendishly difficult once, but these two can stroll it in. 34th over: India 180-3 (Kohli 68, Dhoni 5) The former Indian captain gets off strike first ball of the Behrendorff over, however, jumping and stabbing a ball to square leg. Kohli wants to make the most of the strike, so he punches two runs through cover, then gets low and cuts a fuller ball through deep extra cover for four! That was glorious, just straight enough to beat the cover sweeper despite a sprawl. Behrendorff bowls fuller, and Kohli lifts him away over midwicket for six! There was no one out there, so Kohli went to the agricultural zone with craftsman\u2019s exactitude. Hit the fence on the full. Bring back your best bowler to force a wicket? How about we smash him for 14 runs instead? We can also announce that Kohli has now exceeded his ODI average. 33rd over: India 166-3 (Kohli 55, Dhoni 4) Smart from Maxwell: round the wicket with his off-breaks, not giving Dhoni space. Knows that Dhoni starts slowly. And that\u2019s exactly what happens, with three blocks plus a pull straight to the field. The only run from the over is a single punched to cover from the last, denying Kohli the strike. That\u2019s absolutely the perfect result for Australia. 32nd over: India 165-3 (Kohli 55, Dhoni 3) Behrendorff returns, with Finch determined to press the advantage while a chance to derail India presents itself. Wickets required. But Kohli hands Dhoni the strike, and Dhoni gets moving immediately with a cut for two. Then fends a single after blocking a couple. 31st over: India 161-3 (Kohli 54, Dhoni 0) Kohli\u2019s 50 comes up from the first ball of the Maxwell over with a cut for two. He flicks two more, takes a single, then while Rayudu\u2019s mis-hit hangs in the air above midwicket, Kohli crosses back to take the strike and then score another single. He\u2019s made six busily from an over in which his partner got out. MS Dhoni comes to the middle. This is significant, after his very slow batting the other night. Can\u2019t afford to do the same here. They need 138 from 114. Thank mercy. The vet has run out. Look away now, the kids don\u2019t need to see this. Ambati Rayudu has gone to live on a farm where he has lots of room to run around. 30th over: India 155-2 (Kohli 48, Rayudu 24) Somebody please put up the green screen around Rayudu\u2019s innings. This is painful. It\u2019s ugly. It\u2019s uncomfortable. It\u2019s a pair of poorly chosen shoes. Rayudu slogs over cover, walking at Richardson and skewing his drive. Then charges again and skews over mid-off, the man running back but unable to make up the ground. Gets two runs from each shot but it\u2019s desperate stuff. Compare that to the silky way that Kohli rides the bounce and steers a single to third man. India need 144 from 120 balls. 29th over: India 149-2 (Kohli 47, Rayudu 19) That was close! Kohli pulls just past Finch at midwicket, who couldn\u2019t snare it with a dive. Maxwell just laughs, nothing else he can do. Four singles from the over. Kohli has 47. He\u2019s still 13 runs short of topping his average. 28th over: India 145-2 (Kohli 45, Rayudu 17) Smashed! Perfect straight drive from Kohli, but credit the save to S. Tumps. The batsman smashes the shot straight into the non-striker\u2019s wicket. No run, so Kohli goes back to Richardson and late-cuts a single. Rayudu plays another loose shot, a big pull that nearly carries to deep backward square. Maybe he figures that it\u2019s worked so far, so why change? India need 154 more from 22 overs. 27th over: India 142-2 (Kohli 43, Rayudu 16) Glenn Maxwell gets a bowl. Gets cut by Kohli for a couple, and mistimed by Rayudu on another slog to deep midwicket. But he\u2019s still there. A couple more singles make five from the over. 26th over: India 137-2 (Kohli 39, Rayudu 15) The batsmen trade glides to third man. Handscomb does some more good work at midwicket, diving to save a boundary from Siddle. Kohli has to settle for two, so goes back and cuts the next hard, but to the sweeper. 25th over: India 132-2 (Kohli 35, Rayudu 14) Lyon bowls to Kohli, who drives one to cover. To Rayudu, who misses a sweep down leg and scrambles an extra thanks to Carey\u2019s fumble. And to Kohli, who leans forward and turns a single in front of square. Emblematic of how these two are going, in contrasting fashion. A couple more singles takes the over total to six runs. 24th over: India 126-2 (Kohli 32, Rayudu 13) Gee, Rayudu is really on struggle street today. Trying to slog his way out of trouble. Tugs Stoinis away, high of the top edge and could easily have holed out but lands safely at midwicket for two. Then slashes two just past Maxwell behind point. Chill, Winston. 23rd over: India 121-2 (Kohli 31, Rayudu 9) Siddle back, and overpitches, and Kohli eases it through midwicket for two. Lovely shot. But as Rayudu comes on strike, he throws his hands at Siddle and edges him for four! There\u2019s a catcher back there, too, but Shaun Marsh is more like a fifth slip or a Test gully. Rayudu would have been straight into the pouch at first slip. 22nd over: India 114-2 (Kohli 28, Rayudu 5) The crowd get rowdy as a Mexican wave goes around the ground, and as Rayudu plays a pull shot. Only a single, but the solid contact will help his confidence. 21st over: India 111-2 (Kohli 26, Rayudu 4) Lyon has rattled through six overs for 24 runs now, as Kohli takes a couple of singles and Rayudu gets a leg bye. Chetan Narula on ABC radio points out that Rayudu has retired from Indian first-class cricket, so before this series he hasn\u2019t played a competitive match since an ODI against West Indies on November 1 last year. 20th over: India 108-2 (Kohli 24, Rayudu 4) Three more balls becalmed, then Rayudu finally gets off the mark in Australia. Opens the face to guide Stoinis past Alex Carey behind the stumps for four. 19th over: India 103-2 (Kohli 23, Rayudu 0) Just the Kohli single from Lyon\u2019s over. Always nice to bowl just after a wicket. See below: that far side of the ground is about where Handscomb was fielding. 18th over: India 102-2 (Kohli 22, Rayudu 0) Both openers gone, and it\u2019s over to Kohli. He\u2019s joined by Ambati Rayudu, who made a blob in Sydney as well as burning India\u2019s only DRS review. What a catch from Handscomb! And isn\u2019t he pumped up about it. That eastern side of the ground is still bathed in low late sunlight as the evening encroaches. There\u2019s a slice of sunlight about 10 metres deep by the boundary line. Handscomb is right in it. So as Rohit tries to bomb the crowd with a pull shot, Handscomb is staring into the sun at the same time as running around under the swirling ball, trying to get to the drop, and eventually judging it right. He yells in a way that seems more anger than celebration, and Stoinis does the same mid-pitch. They\u2019ve been on the protein shakes during the break. And just as he started to get his wheels turning, Rohit falls in the same area of the ground where he holed out during the recent Test match here. 17th over: India 97-1 (Rohit 40, Kohli 20) Single, single, single, then eventually Rohit has had enough. He hit half a dozen sixes the other night in Sydney, and notches his first tonight. Simply done, a good stride to the ball from Lyon, and a big clean ping over midwicket. A single raises the 50 partnership. 16th over: India 87-1 (Rohit 32, Kohli 18) Rohit strikes Siddle a little airily through midwicket, but gets away with it. A couple of runs from that stroke, plus three singles from the rest of the over, and that\u2019s drinks. \u201cThose are drinks!\u201d comes the correction from pedants across the world. 15th over: India 82-1 (Rohit 29, Kohli 16) Rohit and Kohli have had a few run-outs between them during their partnerships. There was a stutter on a single in Siddle\u2019s previous over, and now another from Lyon, when Rohit stutters down the wicket after playing Lyon to Glenn Maxwell on the leg side. Kohli said no, and Rohit had to dive back in as Maxwell whipped in the return. 14th over: India 79-1 (Rohit 28, Kohli 14) Rohit Sharma leans back and six! He loves the pull shot, and plays the short ball well. Siddle suffers the full punishment for that. Then, not content with the back-foot drive from earlier, Kohli shuffles onto the front shoe and plays a perfect on-drive down the ground for four. The overhead camera was actually some use there, it was interesting to see just how much Kohli moved around his crease, in tiny incremental degrees, to get in just the right position to play that stroke. 13 from the over. 13th over: India 66-1 (Rohit 21, Kohli 8) Lyon with another four-run effort, they\u2019re happy to bide their time against him for now. 12th over: India 62-1 (Rohit 18, Kohli 7) Oh, that\u2019s just unfair. Kohli looks to come forward to Richardson, then sees the in-between length and hits reverse. But he aims at cover anyway, with a back-foot punch that reaches the rope. Unreasonable. 11th over: India 57-1 (Rohit 17, Kohli 3) Lyon is on as soon as the fielding restrictions cease, and Rohit and Kohli milk four singles from his over. A little aerial with the push to long-on, at one stage. 10th over: India 53-1 (Rohit 15, Kohli 1) A couple of runs through the covers first ball, but then Behrendorff settles into that tight line on the pads, just back of a length, and Rohit can\u2019t do anything with it. Still happy to wait out a bowler who creates some danger. These analysts are very good: it\u2019s interesting when the data backs up something a conception you\u2019ve drawn from watching. 9th over: India 51-1 (Rohit 13, Kohli 1) Siddle to Kohli once Rohit finally relents. Kohli walks across his stumps and plays a one-handed leg glance to avert the risk of an lbw and to score a single. As you do. 8th over: India 48-1 (Rohit 11, Kohli 0) You can tell from the crowd noise: King Kohli comes to the crease. India fans flock to the fence to get as close as they can. Hands in the air. Rohit farms the strike to make sure Kohli has to wait a while to face his first ball. The best composers always make you wait before the beat drops. The show is over. One ball after lacing a lovely orthodox cover drive, Dhawan tries a lofted drive over long-off but gets far more elevation than lateral distance. It hangs in the air a long, long time, and Usman Khawaja beneath it has time to get nervous and nearly lets the ball squirm out from between his fingers. But he hangs on. 7th over: India 41-0 (Rohit 9, Dhawan 27) Hello! Peter Siddle, disparaged by a fair proportion of cricket followers for being past his prime, is sending them down at 138 kilometres an hour. Then 139. That\u2019s almost as brisk as he\u2019s ever been. It doesn\u2019t help when he strays down leg side and Dhawan deflects him fine for four. 6th over: India 34-0 (Rohit 9, Dhawan 20) Dhawan keeps going. Slashes away at Richardson, and the ball flies past Maxwell at point for another boundary. Nice for Rohit to be able to chill down the other end and have someone else push the early runs. A couple of singles and a wide as Richardson loses his line. He\u2019s getting movement though. 5th over: India 27-0 (Rohit 8, Dhawan 15) Shikhar Dhawan is one of those batsmen who can look so sloppy, and then so good. Does what he wants, or at least tries to. After deflecting four leg byes off his thigh pad, he walks at Behrendorff and slogs, no other word for it. Unless you\u2019re Jason Gillespie, who describes it as \u201che mungs it into the leg side for two\u201d on ABC radio. Ugly shot. Then Behrendorff bowls full and wide, and Dhawan drops to one knee with consummate style and flays it through cover for four. You miss one hundred percent of the outrageous slogs you don\u2019t play. 4th over: India 15-0 (Rohit 8, Dhawan 7) Jhye Richardson picked up Virat Kohli\u2019s wicket in Sydney with a catch straight to square leg. Nearly gets Dhawan the same way. Flicks it away just past the man in the circle for four. 3rd over: India 10-0 (Rohit 8, Dhawan 2) Richardson, having just bowled his over, does a better job in the field. A big sprint and dive at third man saves a boundary from Dhawan\u2019s slashing shot, and in the end the batsmen only get one. Rohit sees out the rest of Behrendorff\u2019s over. 2nd over: India 9-0 (Rohit 8, Dhawan 1) Jhye Richardson, another West Australian, will open from the River End. Shorter than your usual Australian fast bowler, he told us the other night he likes to see himself as \u201cNot better or worse, just different.\u201d It\u2019s a good way to look at the world. He\u2019s got an easy casual lope to the crease, then whangs down the ball at usually over 140 kilometres per hour. Took 4-26 the other night. Doesn\u2019t start so well tonight. Dhawan is quickly off strike, then Rohit clunks a pull shot for four as Richardson drops short, then another short ball is guided for four behind point. 1st over: India 0-0 (Rohit 0, Dhawan 0) It\u2019s Big German Disco time. Jason Behrendorff takes the ball, left-arm brisk from the Cathedral End, with the hill and the trees and the old scoreboard behind him. And let me tell you, he is right in the money from the get-go. Left-arm over, swinging the ball into the pads of Rohit, and nailing that line so consistently that Rohit just blocks the over out. The batsman knows that his team has the firepower to chase 299 on a very nice batting track, as long as those early wickets don\u2019t tumble again. Thanks Adam. Let\u2019s see if India can live up to their chasing credentials this time, after botching the start in Sydney the other night. 50th over: Australia 298-9 (Lyon 12, Behrendorff 1) Clever from Lyon, getting across his stumps to lift Bhuvi over short-fine for four! He goes BIIIIIG from the final ball of the innings popping the Indian trump a long way back into the eastern stand! What a fantastic way to finish, the veteran keeping his head, taking responsibility and sticking the landing. He walks off unbeaten with 12 from five. All told, a fine total from the hosts after such a poor start. When Shaun Marsh walked in as Carey departed, the score was 26-2 in the 8th, and there he was until almost the very end, making a flawless 131 from 123 in the extreme heat. It was the West Australian\u2019s fourth ODI ton in his last eight innings, and seventh in this format overall. There is no doubting his importance to this Australian 50-over side heading into a World Cup campaign starting in just 137 days from now. He took the lead in partnerships with Khawaja, Hanscomb and Stoinis, who all fell in the 20s, before Maxwell helped him tick up into top gear, the Victorian making 48 in 37 balls as Marsh cleared the rope three times after passing 100. If they can keep India under 299 in their 50 overs, they will win the series. Simple as that! But can they get Kohli early again? All the focus now turns to the Australian bowlers. For that, I\u2019ll hand over to Geoff Lemon. Bye for now! Make that 4/3! Siddle didn\u2019t make adequate contact to the wider Bhuvi offering, slicing into the deep, Kohli making plenty of ground before completing the catch. Australia have lost 3/3, Richardson taken at deep point by Dhawan from Shami\u2019s change of pace. Fantastic bowling from India at the death, the penultimate over going for just two. 49th over: Australia 284-7 (Richardson 1, Lyon 0) \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d says Ben Jones, setting up for something positively droll. \u201cAustralia laid such a great platform, Maxwell played well, and they still aren\u2019t going to make 300? Almost like the strategy ain\u2019t working.\u201d Two in three balls! Another slower one, the knuckle ball this time. This is almost identical to Maxwell\u2019s downfall, Marsh unable to lift Bhuvi over long-off. 48th over: Australia 284-7 (Richardson 1, Lyon 0) That\u2019s a clutch bit of cricket from Bhuvi, picking up both set men just as they were about to push the hosts well beyond 300. The slower one got him, Maxwell trying to flat-bat him over the long-off rope but not quite making the journey, taken safely by the sweeper Karthik. 47th over: Australia 281-5 (Marsh 130, Maxwell 47) Rohit nearly pulls down a brilliant, Peter Taylor-esque catch! He went up with one hand on the extra cover circle and dragged it out of the sky but it didn\u2019t stick in there after he landed. Maxwell uses the life, clipping Siraj\u2019s full toss into almost non-existent midwicket gap for four. Fantastic batting from these two. Siraj, on debut, finishes with 0/76. He\u2019ll be back, on far easier afternoons than this. 46th over: Australia 272-5 (Marsh 129, Maxwell 39) Bhuvi is back and is harder for Maxwell to get away, unable to find the rope despite his best efforts. The Indian number one knows the deal to Maxwell, sending down all his variations. That doesn\u2019t work for Marsh though, the left-hander walloping another six! That might the biggest, nearly into the viewing room for the players in the Bradman Stand. They run hard for a couple down the ground to finish, making 12 from it. 45th over: Australia 260-5 (Marsh 121, Maxwell 36) It is the control with Maxwell not the power, pinpointing precisely where he wants the Shami full toss to go over cover and nailing it. He\u2019s unlucky not to beat short-fine but it gives the strike back to Marsh, who takes full advantage with a stand-and-deliver nearly landing in the second deck of the Football Stand! That\u2019s his second big one in the last ten minutes or so, struck as clean as Geoff Lemon\u2019s dinner plate. 300? Speaking of Geoff, if you\u2019re at a loose end Thursday, come along to our live show. 44th over: Australia 247-5 (Marsh 114, Maxwell 30) 13 all up from the eventful Siraj over, Maxwell hammering a pulled boundary before his reprieve then, rather brilliantly, slicing a wide yorker over point with one hand on the bat afterwards. With complete control, too. Forearms like Ricky Ponting. NOT OUT! Missing! Down the legside! IS MAXWELL LBW? He almost certainly is, but he has to send it upstairs at this stage of the innings. Stand by. 43rd over: Australia 234-5 (Marsh 110, Maxwell 22) \u201cThe speed!\u201d says Harsha Bhogle on TV, as Maxwell picks up Kuldeep and pops him into the Bradman Stand \u201cthe speed of his hands!\u201d Marsh follows suit later in the over for a second six for the over, using his feet before lofting the wrist spinner over the extra cover rope. Wonderful batting from a man who must be absolutely spent. It makes 16 from the over, by far the biggest of the innings for the Australians. With seven overs to go, they take their third drinks break, an extra one popped in due to the weather. \u201cYou can tell it must be a tad warm when a batsman celebrates a fine century in such subdued fashion as Shaun Marsh,\u201d notes Brian Withington. \u201cProduct idea: are they allowed to insert a small fan into the helmet peak, and/or run some sort of battery assisted coolant?\u201d Do it, mate. Make your millions. 42nd over: Australia 218-5 (Marsh 102, Maxwell 14) Big over this for Siraj and he\u2019s done it superbly, landing his yorker three times and, in turn, kept the pair to just the three singles. 41st over: Australia 214-5 (Marsh 100, Maxwell 12) Kuldeep Yadav returns with two overs still to bowl and both batsmen get into him, Maxwell pulling three then Marsh cutting four into the gap, moving him to one short of 100. He gets the century with a push to extra cover, 108 balls required to collect his seventh ODI ton; four in his most recent eight innings in the 50-over canary yellow. 40th over: Australia 205-5 (Marsh 95, Maxwell 8) Super bowling from Jadeja, pinning Marsh to the crease with four accurate darts. A single down the ground gets him off strike, Maxwell keeping the strike with one to point. 39th over: Australia 203-5 (Marsh 94, Maxwell 7) Maxwell top edge, over the \u2018keeper and four! They are definitely going after him with the short stuff. He gives the strike back to Marsh with a single to point, who returns the favour to square leg. Shami nails his yorker to finish, Maxwell down to it just in time. Nice contest. \u201cBy the way,\u201d adds Brian Withington, \u201crecent scoring rates in this series make me wonder whether this Australian team is some sort of 70s tribute act, bit like the Australian Pink Floyd outfit? Wish You Were Here, anyone?\u201d Speaking of music, Shooting Stars gets a run between overs from the Cricket Ground DJ. Forget about the (excellent) tune itself, for me, it\u2019ll always be linked to this genius Ethan Meldrum mash-up from the 2017 Border-Gavaskar Trophy. 38th over: Australia 195-5 (Marsh 92, Maxwell 1) Marsh is into the 90s with a powerful lofted stroke over midwicket off Jadeja, into the gap and the boundary boards. Earlier in the over, Maxwell was off the mark with one through point. \u201cJust woken and quickly reviewed OBO to be plagued by your \u2018useless fact\u2019 (18th over) about Greg Matthews\u2019s lowest standard deviation. Who has the highest?\u201d asks Brian Withington. \u201cWhat should a captain/selectors prefer - steady grouping around the 40s or the occasional (match-winning) exceptional high score amongst a collection of ducks? What about reverse correlation with the team\u2019s overall batting performance? (I have sometimes reflected that average boosting hundreds in a big team score might be over-valued.) We are not even scratching the surface here - there are no useless cricket facts.\u201d Perhaps the fella batting right now? Geoff has calculated that Shaun Marsh (at Test level) has the fourth highest percentage of single figure scores for specialist batsmen who have been out as many times or more than Marsh. 37th over: Australia 189-5 (Marsh 87, Maxwell 0) Two accurate bumpers from Shami to Maxwell, the Victorian electing to get out of the way both times. Stoinis gets a tiny little bottom edge trying to pull, just making it through to the gloves of Dhoni. That\u2019ll sting even more given he had just smashed boundaries from the previous two Shami deliveries. 36th over: Australia 180-4 (Marsh 86, Stoinis 21) Shot, Shaun! Jadeja is back and Marsh is ever so confident, steering the spinner to the boundary with a lovely little cut. Four singles down the ground and to midwicket makes eight from the set. 35th over: Australia 172-4 (Marsh 80, Stoinis 19) Oooh, close for Bhuvi there, winning Marsh\u2019s inside edge, the ball just missing his leg stump on the deflection. Stonis keeps the strike to finish with a quick single to point. Australia\u2019s run rate is now 4.91, having never cracked five at any stage in the innings. 34th over: Australia 167-4 (Marsh 77, Stoinis 17) The pitch is giving a bit to the spinners so Marsh responds by jumping down the track, smashing Kuldeep back over his head for four. That the shot of the day so far, Marsh well on his way to a ton. He tries to replicate the stroke to finish, albeit along the ground for two. Earlier on, Stonis was looking to go as well, creaming a drive out to the sweeper at cover. I asked Alex Carey if they waited too long to pull the trigger in Sydney. With six wickets in hand, Marsh surely exhausted in this heat and Maxwell still to come, I wonder how long before they try and really give it big. 33rd over: Australia 158-4 (Marsh 71, Stoinis 14) Bhuvi has half of his overs to come, which is good news for Kohli. I\u2019m surprised that he hasn\u2019t let Siraj get through another after a half-decent couple. Sure enough, he\u2019s right back onto his full length at the stumps, only four singles taken when enough room can be made. 32nd over: Australia 154-4 (Marsh 69, Stoinis 12) Kuldeep is back: a nice, aggressive move while Stonis is still finding his groove. Neither batsmen take the bait though, scoring off each delivery but all in ones and twos; Stonis\u2019 glance to finish especially deft. There\u2019s a lot to like about him, not least his new haircut. 31st over: Australia 147-4 (Marsh 66, Stoinis 8) Six off Siraj\u2019s over, punctuated by another ropey half-tracker, which enables Stoinis to register his boundary of the day. But on balance, Kohli would probably take six an over from Siraj with three overs left to come from his least effective bowler so far today. 30th over: Australia 141-4 (Marsh 65, Stoinis 3) Jadeja pushes through an over of darts, five coming from it to the sweepers. Marsh was battling against the spin of Kuldeep early but he\u2019s been in completely control against the left-arm ortho. 29th over: Australia 136-4 (Marsh 62, Stoinis 1) So much better from Siraj. Good captaincy from Kohli to give him a go immediately after a wicket, the man on debut nearly making it two in a hurry when he beat the bat of Stonis with a beauty. Just two from it, which will do him the world of good with four overs still for him to send down. Between overs, they run a cold towel out for Marsh, who is battling in the stinging heat. He should go for the Dean Jones ice necklace, which is also a topic of conversation on Fox Cricket. Never was I more gutted when he was bowled for 98 at the Gabba wearing one in 1994. If I had my way, he would still be batting number three for this Australian ODI side. 28th over: Australia 134-4 (Marsh 61, Stoinis 0) Wicket maiden! Stonis tries to sweep the final Jadeja delivery, but unlike Handscomb, his foot was back in his ground when Dhoni took the bails. DHONI! He may be 37 years old but his gloves remain the smartest in the business! Handscomb got down for the sweep and missed, the legendary wicketkeeper waiting until the back foot was dragged to complete the stumping. Brilliant. 27th over: Australia 134-3 (Marsh 61, Handscomb 20) Siraj is having a shocker on debut, four of his five overs going for more than once boundary. Back from the northern end, Handscomb tucked a short ball off the hip for four before Marsh did much the same from the final ball, helping another on its way. 26th over: Australia 125-3 (Marsh 57, Handscomb 15) Another five runs milked to the sweepers, which will probably suit both sides at this stage of the innings. Rayudu can bowl in this fixture and the next the TV commentary says - he won\u2019t be tested until after the series. I wonder whether they still get sent down to the University of Western Australia for that? For a time in 1990s/2000s, testing for chucking was what that fine institution was surely best known for. 25th over: Australia 120-3 (Marsh 54, Handscomb 13) Shami was on the money to Marsh, keeping him down the business end for four dots, but when he slipped onto the West Austalians pads he did not miss out. 24th over: Australia 116-3 (Marsh 50, Handscomb 13) From 62 deliveries, he brings up the milestone with one down the ground the ball after smashing Jadeja\u2019s shorter offering away for four. Seven off it, Australia nearly up at five an over now. The Cricket Ground DJ plays Just Like Heaven between overs, living out my dream life they are. I came pretty close to getting my debut at The Oval a couple of seasons ago for a Surrey T20 Blast game, submitting a playlist and everything. This year will be mine on the 1s and 2s at a cricket ground somewhere. 23rd over: Australia 109-3 (Marsh 44, Handscomb 12) Shami is back, this time from the northern or Cathedral End. They\u2019re in decent shape these two, Marsh driving down the ground, Handscomb pulling a couple then steering another. The quick nearly slips the final ball through, Marsh just getting his bat down in time. The Khawaja run out, in case you missed it. 22nd over: Australia 104-3 (Marsh 42, Handscomb 9) Jadeja drops short to Marsh first up, the left-hander leaping back and smashing him through the gap at midwicket for four. Back to back boundaries for Australia, the 100 raised with the shot too. Three singles to the boundary riders down the ground makes seven from the over, this partnership already 22 from 21 balls. 21st over: Australia 97-3 (Marsh 36, Handscomb 8) Handscomb has started really well here, latching onto a misdirected wrong\u2019un and creaming it past point to finish a productive over worth nine between the pair. \u201cMarsh ran his partner out,\u201d says Peter Brook, right to the point. \u201cHow do those brothers get selected after a decade of failure?\u201d In fairness to Marsh in this format, he averaged 68 with three tons in 2018. 20th over: Australia 88-3 (Marsh 32, Handscomb 3) Shaun Marsh reaches his 30 KPI, so the coaching staff will be happy with that. \u201cLocking up his spot for 2027,\u201d sniffs Geoff Lemon next to me. Jadeja prompts a false stroke from Marsh, who nearly edges a cut to backward point, before pushing with one down the ground. Earlier, Handscomb picked up his first runs, driving twice to long-off. Jadeja! What a fielder! Racing around from backward point, he collects and throws in one movement while going at full speed, nailing the stumps at the non-strikers\u2019 end. They go upstairs but there is little doubt about Khawaja\u2019s fate. He has one of the most accurate throws in world cricket, if not the very best come to think of it. 19th over: Australia 83-3 (Marsh 30, Handscomb 0) 18th over: Australia 81-2 (Khawaja 21, Marsh 28) Jadeja is on for his first turn today, zipping through his oiver in his usual way, giving up three singles. \u201cIs Glenn Maxwell the new Greg Matthews?\u201d asks Patrick O\u2019Keefe. \u201cBoth perceived as mavericks, as not quite fitting within the short-back-and-sides approach of the national team. Both denied opportunities when it would seem their form and talent warranted a little more support.\u201d I don\u2019t quite see it that way but I understand where you are coming from. Quick useless fact: the batsman in Tests with the least standard deviation with an average over 40? Greg Matthews. I told him this year and he wasn\u2019t aware. If you want to read more about Mo, this is a masterpiece by Shannon Gill. 17th over: Australia 77-2 (Khawaja 21, Marsh 25) The 50 partnership between this pair comes with a Marsh cut of Kuldeep close to the body but is directed well enough for a couple. As Harsha Bhogle notes, the vast majority of those runs are off the bowling off Siraj. Half a chance to finish, Khawaja cutting from deep in the crease, the ball hitting Dhoni on the end of his gloves rather than the webbing. 16th over: Australia 74-2 (Khawaja 21, Marsh 22) Isa Guha makes a good point on Fox Cricket that Rayudu is unlikely to bowl today with his action reported on Saturday, so Siraj will need to find a way to get through his full set of ten. He\u2019s into his fourth now, spraying a wide early on. It doesn\u2019t get any better, a short ball well outside the off-stump jumped on by Marsh, finding the gap at deep point with a cut shot that bounces once before crossing the rope. Another half-tracker follows later in the over, Khawaja raising his front leg before pulling hard into the gap at square leg for four more. That makes 13 runs from the over, Siraj giving up 34 across his four so far. He alone has let Australia off the hook. The two wickets so far, Finch then Carey. 15th over: Australia 61-2 (Khawaja 15, Marsh 16) Better from Marsh here against Kuldeep, coming down and making solid contact to the midwicket boundary rider. Three further singles follow with Khawaja using the depth of the crease to play the turn late through extra cover. Drinks are on the field. 14th over: Australia 57-2 (Khawaja 13, Marsh 14) That\u2019s the way, Marsh taking full advantage of a short ball that holds up, slamming it to the midwicket rope. To finish, Khawaja helps four more behind square leg off his hip, another delivery that doesn\u2019t get up. \u201cSiraj really has to address his length,\u201d Kerry O\u2019Keefe says at the end of the over. This is not the track for banging it in half way down. 13th over: Australia 46-2 (Khawaja 8, Marsh 9) Kuldeep gets his wrong\u2019un out early here, Khawaja handling it well and pushing to long-on for one. Marsh looks far more exposed, done by a hard-spun leg break, only just getting his foot back before Dhoni takes the bails. 12th over: Australia 42-2 (Khawaja 6, Marsh 7) Siraj has a much better time of it with this his second over, bending his back at Marsh who after defending half the over takes one to midwicket. Khawaja is also in defence. This is when Australia got bogged down on Australia, it is worth remembering. 11th over: Australia 41-2 (Khawaja 6, Marsh 6) Kuldeep was superb on Saturday through this period and he\u2019s straight on the moment the fielding restrictions are relaxed. Marsh faces the entirety of this over, finding the sweeper twice at deep cover, for two then one. Kerry O\u2019Keefe on Fox loves the loopy speed that the left-arm wrist spinner bowls at, all of his deliveries south of 80kph. 10th over: Australia 38-2 (Khawaja 6, Marsh 3) Siraj to bowl the final over with the field in, the right arm quick on debut. It\u2019s not a first over he\u2019ll recall fondly, allowing the locals to get off the hook somewhat, Khawaja clipping two then four with a legside wide in between, the boundary reinforcing how fast this outfield is. Marsh is also off the mark from the final ball of the over, pushing three through midwicket. And out goes the field. 9th over: Australia 27-2 (Khawaja 1, Marsh 0) With India\u2019s bowlers moving the ball around so much, Khawaja and Marsh will have to get themselves in before rebuilding the scoreboard. The former would have been off the mark early in the over if not for a diving stop from Kohli in the gully but he does get that first run to mid-on later in the set, Marsh then carefully dealing with the last couple. Bit of a yarn here, via Daniel Dekok on the email. \u201cAfternoon Adam.\u201d And to you. \u201cI know the upcoming Sri Lanka series feels like an afterthought, especially during a high summer one day series, but I saw the following tweet this morning and it was a little bit surprised. It\u2019s a risky ploy by Seven betting on the First Test Aus v Sri Lanka to finish in four and a half days or less. I\u2019m not used to seeing something scheduled when a test should be playing? Also haven\u2019t seen much other conversation about it.\u201d Nor have I. I\u2019ll get to the bottom of this in the dinner break. 8th over: Australia 26-2 (Khawaja 0, Marsh 0) Whoosh, a fast bumper from Shami to Marsh first up, just missing his helmet. Australia have lost 2/6 in five balls with two men in the middle who are yet to score. Going well, then. That\u2019s no good at all, Carey walking before he was caught after top edging a delivery from a pull that he was trying to get out of at the last minute, Dhawan doing the rest at midwicket. This is grim for the home side. A carbon copy of his Test dismissal at the same ground last month! Finch tried to hit Bhuvi into the River Torrens but instead Bhuvi made a mess of his stumps via a small inside edge. Having all-but blown the power play, Australia are in strife. 7th over: Australia 20-1 (Carey 12) 6th over: Australia 18-0 (Carey 11, Finch 5) Fantastic stop in the covers by Karthik, diving to his left and saving three runs. \u201cCarey would have thought that was four off the bat,\u201d says Mike Hussey, the pressure building again through the Shami over. Finch punches hard off the back foot to finish but it doesn\u2019t quite make it to the rope, retaining the strike with three instead. \u201cThat\u2019s the first shot of authority from Finch,\u201d notes Hussey again. 5th over: Australia 14-0 (Carey 10, Finch 2) A tad more control from the Australian pair in this over, Carey pushing Bhuvi to square leg, Finch tucking him behind umpire, the South Aussie then doing the same. Now they have their eye in, time for one of these two to take advantage while the field is up. 4th over: Australia 11-0 (Carey 8, Finch 1) Shami nearly slips past Finch\u2019s inside edge again to begin the over, Mike Hussey on Fox noting that his bat is coming down on a slight angle rather than with the line of the delivery. But he\u2019s off the mark from the next ball, with a compact push to mid-off. I doubt there are many white-ball games that the opener has played for Australia where he hasn\u2019t been off the mark this deep into an innings. Carey cops the best ball of the day so far, Shami forcing him to play with a ball that shaped away beautifully after pitching. He also scores to mid-off before Finch defends the rest. 3rd over: Australia 9-0 (Carey 7, Finch 0) Bhuvi misses down the legside to begin at Carey before beating him with a ball that\u2019s well outside of the off-stump; the second swing and miss we\u2019ve seen to deliveries out there so far. The local lad is happy enough leaving then defending the rest, both sides getting a feel for each other early in this contest. 2nd over: Australia 8-0 (Carey 7, Finch 0) Shami is starting off from the southern, city or river end, depending on your preference. Second up he drifts into Carey\u2019s pads who flicks in front of square for the first boundary of the day, the ball screaming across the outfield and into the boundary just in front of the Bradman Stand. Nice shot. A single to third man gives the strike to Finch, who is beaten on the inside edge then outside of the blade, taking a swing at a wide delivery but without a lot of footwork. Michael Vaughan on the telly observes that the Victorian\u2019s weight transfer doesn\u2019t look quite right to him early in this innings. 1st over: Australia 3-0 (Carey 2, Finch 0) Carey is away first ball, glancing a misdirected delivery down to fine leg for one. Another on the pads gets Finch off strike, albeit via a leg bye. Bhuvi then finds his channel, Carey defending then inside edging to finish, not far away from deflecting back onto his woodwork. An omen of sorts as the players walk out to the middle. Finch and Carey are on their way for the home side, followed by Kohli\u2019s XI. Bhuvi has the ball, starting off from the Cathedral End, bowling with some strong wind assistance. PLAY! If you want to know why I\u2019m hugely into Siraj, this video gives a flavour of what you can expect. He has the most energetic run up and and a lovely delivery stride. He\u2019s rapid and doesn\u2019t bother hiding his emotions for even a moment. A slightly daunting factoid from Andrew Donnison. \u201cThe last time Australia won an ODI series,\u201d he reveals, \u201c90% of the runs were scored by Warner, Head, Smith, Wade and Maxwell.\u201d Cripes. That was the series where Australia made 360 here against Pakistan on the 26 January fixture, with, from memory, Travis Head tallying his maiden international ton. Australia: Aaron Finch (c), Alex Carey (wk), Usman Khawaja, Shaun Marsh, Peter Handscomb, Marcus Stoinis, Glenn Maxwell, Nathan Lyon, Peter Siddle, Jhye Richardson, Jason Behrendorff India: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli (c), Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni (wk), Dinesh Karthik, Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Mohammed Shami Australia unchanged from the side that won in Sydney. For India, Siraj is in! I\u2019m a big fan of this move, one of my IPL faves. The southpaw Khaleel is out. Great news for home fans. The XIs as named are coming in just a moment. The pitch. Looks like it\u2019ll be worth a million runs. But it is worth noting that the average first innings score at Adelaide over the last ten ODIs has been 243. And Australia won here against South Africa in November defending 231. Could it be? Could Australia win their first ODI series for two years? In straight sets, no less? That is the opportunity for the hosts today on a scorching day in the city of churches. Coming as it would at the start of a World Cup year, a triumph over a team as strong as India would do an enormous amount for the confidence of a group that has copped a battering in all forms of the game since the suspensions of you-know-who in 2018. I can report that it is an absolutely filthy day here, the expected top temperature of 41 surely not far away, with an equally brutal northerly gale howling down from the Cathedral End. In turn, so much of what happens will be dictated by the side that gets the luxury of batting first. For fast bowlers, it will be especially rugged. For the visitors, it will be interesting to see what their teamsheet looks like when the toss takes place in about ten minutes from now. They were giving very little away yesterday. Might Dhoni make that shift up to the number four position that Rohit Sharma was recommending after their loss in Sydney? I hope so. Righto, I\u2019ll leave it here for the time being. I\u2019m looking forward to your company throughout the afternoon. Drop me a line in the usual place, or ping me a tweet if that\u2019s more your style. Now that I\u2019ve made it into the air conditioned comfort of the press box, I am never leaving again. It\u2019s going to be one of those days.",

      "bodyText": "The narrator-protagonist of Osman Baig\u2019s first play is identified only as the Journalist, employed at an online provider called Millennium Times. Ticket-buyers play unpaid interns to whom the character, now a senior editor, delivers an induction lecture on \u201cjournalistic integrity\u201d. We are invited to learn from his catastrophic fact-checking error over a piece of breaking news that almost broke the internet. That so appalling a reporter should have achieved such lucrative seniority is a paradox explained by Baig\u2019s punchy and provocative monologue. As the title Fake News indicates, the current US president is the inspirational daemon of the piece. But what makes the work more interesting than numerous other Trump-thumping theatre pieces is Baig\u2019s understanding, as a former TV journalist, that Hillary Clinton\u2019s nemesis was the beneficiary rather than inventor of factual fluidity in public life \u2013 from Fox News to clickbait posting by publications that were once organs of record. In a media where credibility had become relative, falsity was difficult to expose or correct. Baig and director Sam Raffal could usefully do more work on the section in which our lecturer recalls uncovering and distributing his \u201cscoop\u201d. Even a fame hunter would perhaps subject to a little more due diligence what he seems to have discovered. The script also withholds until the close a key previous exchange in the office, which might more effectively be shared with the audience earlier, disguised but in plain sight. A promising writer, Baig is indubitably good news as a performer. Such is his energetic intensity that he often seems to be delivering the entire 50 minutes in a single breath, while keeping every word clear. He has hugely expressive eyes and impressive verbal flexibility, sharply ventriloquising the narrator\u2019s unseen colleagues, including a smoothly manipulative boss, and two rival interns: one ambitious and oddly Bambi-obsessed, the other a posh, patronising vegan. The fringe-friendly combination of hot topic, solo form and compact length make this a perfect prospect for Edinburgh 2019. \u2022 At Theatre 503, London, until 15 January.",

They\u2019ve given their opinion. It is up for parliament to now act on that opinion. There will be job consequences as a result of this decision. We have to do everything we can to protect jobs and working conditions in Britain.\", 3:B - The UK has so far negotiated no new trade deals., 4:B - The terms and conditions on Seaborne Freight website appeared to be a cut-and-paste from a food delivery firm., 5:D - The notes, visible in suspiciously large writing, seemed intended to urge MPs to back Theresa May's deal. The move was described as \"desperate stuff\" by fellow Tory Michael Fabricant. Award yourself a bonus point if you knew who Mel Stride was. , 6:D - Coming in at around 110,000 words, the agreement is 585 pages long. Have you read it? Probably not. Have most MPs read the full text of what they are voting on? The jury is out on that one. , 7:A - Yes, it does. It specifically references Council Directive 2002/60/EC of 27 June 2002 laying down provisions for the control of African swine fever and Directive 92/119/EEC as regards Teschen disease. The agreement isn't exactly a page turner. , 8:B - Johnson wrote a column debating the merits of EU membership for the Telegraph in February 2016, in which he praised the single market, which he is now adamant the UK must leave. , 9:A - Yes, despite the government being found in contempt of parliament late last year for refusing to publish its full legal advice over Brexit, on the day before the crucial vote they were happy to publish a letter from the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox QC, which happened to back May's deal., 10:D - Esther McVey's letter of resignation also said: \"The deal you put before the cabinet yesterday does not honour the result of the referendum. Indeed it doesn't meet the tests you set from the outset of your premiership.\", 11:C - It will cost EU nationals \u00a365 for the application process to be able to stay in the country after Brexit., 12:A - Cable has been leader of the Liberal Democrats since July 2017, after Theresa May's snap election, which cost her the Conservative majority in parliament. He has promised to step down once Brexit is 'resolved'., 13:A - Norwegian MP Heidi Nordby Lunde also said: \"I do not believe it is in Norway\u2019s interest to invite the UK into the Efta bloc. It would certainly upset the balance within Efta \u2013 and thus our relationship with the EU. Further, the EEA agreement presupposes a consensus between the countries to harmonise with the same EU laws and regulations the UK wants to veto.\", 14:B - The comments were made by the Cardiff City football manager, Neil Warnock. The club have subsequently distanced themselves from his statement., 15:A - Cameron left the podium after resigning with a little sing-song ditty. It remains to be seen how and when Theresa May's time at No 10 will end.</p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"4\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"A fair effort, but like the number of votes we expect May's deal to get today, you could do better\" data-share=\"I got _/_ in the Guardian Brexit Meaningful vote quiz\" data-min-score=\"5\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">5 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\">A fair effort, but like the number of votes we expect May's deal to get today, you could do better</p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Well done.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a framing that\u2019s been everywhere over the past two years: <em>the Resistance v Donald Trump</em>. By some definitions that \u201cresistance\u201d even includes people like <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/815210/mitt-romney-just-joined-resistance\">Mitt Romney</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/02/politics/george-w-bush-michelle-obama-mccain/index.html\">George W Bush</a>. By almost all definitions it encompasses mainstream Democrats, such as the likely presidential hopefuls Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand.</p> <p>In their rhetoric and policy advocacy, this trio has been steadily moving to the left to keep pace with a leftward-moving Democratic party. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/09/cory-booker-2020-new-hampshire\">Booker</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/10/kamala-harris-democratic-senator-white-house-president-2020\">Harris</a> and Gillibrand know that voters demand action and are more supportive than ever of Medicare for All and universal childcare. <br> Gillibrand, long considered a moderate, has even gone as far as to endorse abolishing US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and, along with Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders\u2019 single-payer healthcare bill. Harris has also backed universal healthcare and free college tuition for most Americans.</p> <p>But outward appearances aren\u2019t everything. Booker, Harris and Gillibrand have been making a very different pitch of late \u2013 on Wall Street. According to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/07/wall-street-and-new-york-business-execs-gear-up-for-2020-presidential-election-.html\">CNBC</a>, all three potential candidates have been reaching out to financial executives lately, including Blackstone\u2019s Jonathan Gray, Robert Wolf from 32 Advisors and the Centerbridge Partners founder Mark Gallogly.</p> <p>Wall Street, after all, played an important role getting the senators where they are today. During his 2014 Senate run, in which just 7% of his contributions came from small donors, Booker raised $2.2m from the securities and investment industry. Harris and Gillibrand weren\u2019t far behind in 2018, and even the progressive Democrat Sherrod Brown has solicited donations from Gallogly and other powerful executives.</p> <p>When CNBC\u2019s story about <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/04/kirsten-gillibrand-reaches-out-to-wall-street-execs-about-potential-2020-run-for-president.html\">Gillibrand personally working the phones to woo Wall Street executives</a> came out, her team responded defensively, noting her support for financial regulation and promising that if she did run she would take \u201cno corporate Pac money\u201d. But what\u2019s most telling isn\u2019t that Gillibrand and others want Wall Street\u2019s money, it\u2019s that they want the blessings of financial CEOs. Even if she doesn\u2019t take their contributions, she\u2019s signaling that she\u2019s just playing politics with populist rhetoric. That will allow capitalists to focus their attention on candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who have shown a real willingness to abandon the traditional coziness of the Democratic party with the finance, insurance and real estate industries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/14/kamala-harris-criticises-those-sowing-hate-but-stays-quiet-on-presidential-run\">Kamala Harris criticises those 'sowing hate' but stays quiet on presidential run</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gillibrand and others are behaving perfectly rationally. The last presidential election cost $6.6bn \u2013 advertising, staff and conventions are expensive.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a framing that\u2019s been everywhere over the past two years: the Resistance v Donald Trump. By some definitions that \u201cresistance\u201d even includes people like Mitt Romney and George W Bush. By almost all definitions it encompasses mainstream Democrats, such as the likely presidential hopefuls Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand. In their rhetoric and policy advocacy, this trio has been steadily moving to the left to keep pace with a leftward-moving Democratic party. Booker, Harris and Gillibrand know that voters demand action and are more supportive than ever of Medicare for All and universal childcare. Gillibrand, long considered a moderate, has even gone as far as to endorse abolishing US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and, along with Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders\u2019 single-payer healthcare bill. Harris has also backed universal healthcare and free college tuition for most Americans. But outward appearances aren\u2019t everything. Booker, Harris and Gillibrand have been making a very different pitch of late \u2013 on Wall Street. According to CNBC, all three potential candidates have been reaching out to financial executives lately, including Blackstone\u2019s Jonathan Gray, Robert Wolf from 32 Advisors and the Centerbridge Partners founder Mark Gallogly. Wall Street, after all, played an important role getting the senators where they are today. During his 2014 Senate run, in which just 7% of his contributions came from small donors, Booker raised $2.2m from the securities and investment industry. Harris and Gillibrand weren\u2019t far behind in 2018, and even the progressive Democrat Sherrod Brown has solicited donations from Gallogly and other powerful executives. When CNBC\u2019s story about Gillibrand personally working the phones to woo Wall Street executives came out, her team responded defensively, noting her support for financial regulation and promising that if she did run she would take \u201cno corporate Pac money\u201d. But what\u2019s most telling isn\u2019t that Gillibrand and others want Wall Street\u2019s money, it\u2019s that they want the blessings of financial CEOs. Even if she doesn\u2019t take their contributions, she\u2019s signaling that she\u2019s just playing politics with populist rhetoric. That will allow capitalists to focus their attention on candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who have shown a real willingness to abandon the traditional coziness of the Democratic party with the finance, insurance and real estate industries. Gillibrand and others are behaving perfectly rationally. The last presidential election cost $6.6bn \u2013 advertising, staff and conventions are expensive. But even more important than that, they know that while leftwing stances might help win Democratic primaries, the path of least resistance in the general election is capitulation to the big forces of capital that run this country. Those elites might allow some progressive tinkering on the margins, but nothing that challenges the inequities that keep them wealthy and their victims weak. Big business is likely to bet heavily on the Democratic party in 2020, maybe even more so than it did in 2016. In normal circumstances, the Democratic party is the second-favorite party of capital; with an erratic Trump around, it is often the first. The American ruling class has a nice hustle going with elections. We don\u2019t have a labor-backed social democratic party that could create barriers to avoid capture by monied interests. It\u2019s telling that when asked about the former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper\u2019s recent chats with Wall Street political financiers, a staff member told CNBC: \u201cWe meet with a wide range of donors with shared values across sectors.\u201d Plenty of Democratic leaders believe in the neoliberal growth model.

      "body": "<p>The answer to the question \u201cWho\u2019s afraid of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?\u201d is establishment Democrats in Congress, apparently. A recent Politico<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/11/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-democrats-establisment-1093728\">report</a> says that fellow House members are worried she will \u201cunleash a tweet at them\u201d, and are \u201cafraid\u201d of her stinging public criticisms of Democrats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/14/another-day-another-reason-to-be-elated-by-congresswoman-alexandria-ocasio-cortez\">Another day, another reason to be elated by congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Their fear is not irrational. Ocasio-Cortez has been using Twitter masterfully, as a way of directing the national political conversation. The Politico<em> </em>article compares her technique to that of Donald Trump, and this isn\u2019t completely wrong: the president has long used his Twitter account to keep the media talking about whatever he wants them to be talking about. Democrats have long failed to keep pace \u2013 they end up reacting to whatever Trump says, rather than setting the agenda themselves. In Ocasio-Cortez we see (at last!) what it might look like for lefties to retake control \u2013 to begin talking about what <em>we </em>want to talk about rather than whatever nonsense Trump is spewing this week.</p> <p>To see what a \u201cgame-changer\u201d Ocasio-Cortez is, you need only look at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nydailynews/status/1081388147991367681\">this</a> front page:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NYDailyNews/status/1081388147991367681\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It&#39;s clear that newly sworn-in Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez intends to make good on her campaign promises <a href=\"https://t.co/ndsWH7aXO1\">https://t.co/ndsWH7aXO1</a><br><br>Take an early look at Saturday&#39;s front cover... <a href=\"https://t.co/5VKtT6r3dU\">pic.twitter.com/5VKtT6r3dU</a></p>&mdash; New York Daily News (@NYDailyNews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYDailyNews/status/1081388147991367681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 5, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>It\u2019s incredible: Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s remark about 70% marginal tax rates on the rich was delivered offhand in an interview. It immediately sparked a national political debate about taxes. Paul Krugman weighed in to say that taxing extremely high incomes made sound economic sense. Jeff Stein of the Washington Post<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/05/ocasio-cortez-wants-higher-taxes-very-rich-americans-heres-how-much-money-could-that-raise/?utm_term=.acec53c37bd2\">laid out some of the ways</a> that this money could be used:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>It could come close to funding the entirety of Sanders\u2019s free college tuition plan (<a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/alfresco/publication-pdfs/2000786-an-analysis-of-senator-bernie-sanderss-tax-and-transfer-proposals.pdf\">$800bn</a></em><em>), fund President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to get close to universal prekindergarten ($75bn </em><em> over a decade), forgive more than half the student debt in America (<a href=\"https://polis.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398671\">$1.4tn</a></em><em>), cover Democratic leaders\u2019 plan for boosting teacher pay and school funding (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2018/05/22/democrats-in-congress-try-to-woo-back-teachers-with-100-billion-plan/?tid=a_inl_manual&amp;utm_term=.7cb28c00c7f0\">$100bn</a></em><em>), or come close to funding a $1tn </em><em> infrastructure plan.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>If Ocasio-Cortez hadn\u2019t made the remark, there would be no discussion. But she did, and so now there\u2019s a discussion! Now Nobel prize winners are publicly pointing out that high taxes are good, and moderate Democrats are being pressured to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_waleedshahid/status/1082026191853359107\">endorse</a> \u201cradical\u201d ideas. As the New York Times<em> </em>reported, she is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/nyregion/ocasio-cortez-democrats-congress.html\">pushing the Democrats to the left whether they like it or not</a>. She has realized what Republicans have known for a long time: if people are talking about your agenda, <em>even </em>if they\u2019re talking about how bad and silly it is, you are making that agenda more plausible. (It\u2019s often called \u201cshifting the Overton window\u201d.) Yes, the National Review<em> </em>will squeal that X tax hike won\u2019t be enough to pay for Y program. But you have got them on the defensive.</p> <p>I\u2019ll admit, when Ocasio-Cortez was elected, I was worried. In 2008, a lot of people my age fell in love with Barack Obama, and suffered bitter disappointment when he started listening to Larry Summers instead of Cornel West. Many of us became cynical: we learned not to put much faith in dynamic young leaders, because as soon as they get into power, they will inevitably become just like all the others: they will start issuing excuses for why political constraints make it simply impossible to change anything, and while you won\u2019t be able to prove they\u2019re <em>wrong</em>, you will come to suspect that they aren\u2019t really trying very hard.</p> <p>But so far, thank God, Ocasio-Cortez has been an inspiring exception to this. She made it clear that her loyalties weren\u2019t with the Democratic leadership but rather the protesters occupying the offices of the Democratic leadership. She told us what really goes on in Congress: when Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics held a seminar for incoming congresspeople, in which business leaders told them not to rock the boat, Ocasio-Cortez revealed all. You\u2019re not supposed to do that \u2013 you\u2019re supposed to handle your concerns quietly within the House, not open up to your constituents about them. They say that she \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-chastized-not-understanding-how-congress-works/\">doesn\u2019t understand how the place works</a>\u201d. But it seems more like they\u2019re the ones who don\u2019t understand how building power works.</p> <p>The Politico<em> </em>report offers a useful insight into how insider Democratic politics work \u2013 the article is full of long-serving Democrats grousing that the upstart Ocasio-Cortez has dared to suggest that some of them aren\u2019t doing a very good job. Apparently they keep trying to take her aside and give her that age-old speech: <em>It\u2019s very well for you to be a radical on the campaign trail, but now that you\u2019re in Congress you need to stop making waves and let us show you how things are done. </em>As one said: \u201cI think she needs to give herself an opportunity to know her colleagues and to give herself a sense of the chemistry of the body before passing judgment on anyone or anything.\u201d</p> <p>You can see, then, why the Democratic party ends up being so disappointing. You shouldn\u2019t pass judgment on <em>anyone or anything </em>when you get to Congress. Even though the congressional Democratic party has <em>utterly failed </em>to grapple with climate change, the great existential problem of our time! Politico<em> </em>reports that \u201cwhen House majority leader Steny Hoyer told reporters that a new climate committee that Ocasio-Cortez championed would not have subpoena power, she retweeted the news and chastised Democratic leadership\u201d. She said: \u201cOur goal is to treat climate change like the serious, existential threat it is by drafting an ambitious solution on the scale necessary \u2013 AKA a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d \u2013 to get it done. A weak committee misses the point and endangers people.\u201d This is absolutely true. She is right. Climate action has to be serious, and if Democrats in Congress won\u2019t be serious, they need to be called on it!</p> <p>Arguments in defense of the status quo are usually presented pragmatically: don\u2019t push too hard because it will hurt your goals. <em>We\u2019re on your side, we\u2019re looking out for your interests, we just have a better way of getting things done</em>. You can see exactly this in how House Democrats are trying to keep Ocasio-Cortez from <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/11/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-democrats-establisment-1093728\">endorsing their primary opponents</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>In private conversations with Ocasio-Cortez over the past few months, [Representative Nydia] Vel\u00e1zquez counseled Ocasio-Cortez against targeting her Democratic colleagues in future elections. The two had a \u2018long, long conversation\u2019 about the dynamics of Congress and Washington, and how there shouldn\u2019t be a \u2018litmus test\u2019 for every district. Vel\u00e1zquez told Ocasio-Cortez she should think twice in the future before backing primaries against her colleagues. [Stephanie] Murphy, the first Vietnamese woman elected to Congress, represents a swing district and could lose her seat if she\u2019s forced to move left in a primary, Vel\u00e1zquez said during the talk.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This is concerning, of course. In order to get Democrats in Congress to move left, there <em>have</em><em> </em>to be primary threats. This, historically, is one way socialists have won victories in the United States: they have forced the major political parties to move leftward in order to neutralize the socialist threat. It\u2019s not surprising that Ocasio-Cortez is being asked not to \u201cundermine\u201d fellow Democrats, but it\u2019s encouraging that so far she seems to be going her own way. Politico<em> </em>says that while she is cordial to her fellow party members, she does not give in:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>She\u2019s very friendly in person, chatting up fellow lawmakers and security workers in the Capitol as she\u2019s tailed by admirers and reporters. Then they see the Ocasio-Cortez on Twitter, where she frequently snaps at critics and occasionally at fellow Democrats.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>What the reporter calls \u201csnapping\u201d, I call \u201cbeing frank and honest about what is actually going on in Washington\u201d. And I dearly hope she keeps doing it, and isn\u2019t intimidated by colleagues who think she needs to be more meek and deferential.</p> <p>There is a lot of dismissal of Ocasio-Cortez for her bluntness on Twitter, but I have to say, among the young lefties I know, many adore her for being witty, smart and combative on social media. She does not take crap, and we have spent so long waiting for someone who \u201cgives as good as she gets\u201d. The tweets may be snarky, but they get to the point, and they finally make us feel as if we\u2019re on the side doing the \u201cdunking\u201d rather than the side being \u201cdunked on\u201d. When Chris Cillizza of CNN lied about manipulating a quote from her, she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1082357214134841344\">demanded accountability</a>. When PolitiFact disproportionately focuses on her over the president\u2019s propagandists, she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1082372063866834944\">calls them on it</a>. Her remarks are keeping her in the news, but more importantly, they\u2019re keeping her <em>agenda </em>in the news.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/14/standing-rock-ocasio-cortez-protest-climate-activism\">Standing Rock inspired Ocasio-Cortez to run. That's the power of protest | Rebecca Solnit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Conservatives cannot stop talking about Ocasio-Cortez. Sean Hannity literally <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-sean-hannity_us_5c34273ce4b0116c11ef3d62\">repeats her agenda on live television</a> and then thinks he\u2019s the one winning! She drives them up the wall, and it\u2019s fantastic. But there\u2019s one person who never mentions her: Donald Trump. Strange, isn\u2019t it? Trump mocks <em>everyone </em>on Twitter. But he has never once sent a tweet about her, even though they both have major presences on the platform. I suspect I know exactly why: he realizes that she\u2019s better at this than him. He may be able to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/trump-shares-parody-warren-1-2020-slogan\">make</a> jokes at the expense of Elizabeth Warren, but Ocasio-Cortez is better at online repartee than almost anyone else. He is wise to keep away from tangling with her. Just recently, when Joe Lieberman made a patronizing comment about Ocasio-Cortez not representing the future of the party, she gave a <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/01/11/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-responds-to-joe-lieberman-jab-who-dis/\">brief but devastating retort</a> that made him look like an out-of-touch fogey. (I doubt he even understood it.)</p> <p>There are other reasons people my age have truly been enjoying watching Ocasio-Cortez in action. For one thing, she\u2019s capable of talking about immigration without making arguments about how Democrats are the <em>real </em>party of border security. She bluntly sticks up for progressive values, rather than timidly using conservative premises. She\u2019s not always perfectly polished, but I feel as if she\u2019s on my side and won\u2019t back down, which is something millennial leftists really need right now.</p> <p>My desperate, pleading hope is that instead of succumbing to the inevitable pressure from congressional peers \u2013 moderate your rhetoric, \u201cget serious\u201d, don\u2019t criticize the party \u2013 she doubles down and keeps kicking ass. She\u2019s already showing how we can successfully change the conversation: the Green New Deal, like Medicare for All, has gone from marginal to mainstream within a matter of months. Politico<em> </em>makes it clear: fellow Democrats are scared, and that\u2019s exactly how it should be.</p> <p>Now we need Ocasio-Cortezes everywhere, young Democratic Socialists of America lefties in office who will not be intimidated by the advice of the wise elders to slow down, calm down, shut up. We will remember what Martin Luther King said: when the pragmatic liberals say \u201cwait\u201d, they almost always mean \u201cnever\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>This piece <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/01/how-a-o-c-is-changing-the-game\">originally ran in Current Affairs</a>, which is edited by Nathan Robinson</em></p></li> </ul>",

The Politico article compares her technique to that of Donald Trump, and this isn\u2019t completely wrong: the president has long used his Twitter account to keep the media talking about whatever he wants them to be talking about. Democrats have long failed to keep pace \u2013 they end up reacting to whatever Trump says, rather than setting the agenda themselves. In Ocasio-Cortez we see (at last!) what it might look like for lefties to retake control \u2013 to begin talking about what we want to talk about rather than whatever nonsense Trump is spewing this week. To see what a \u201cgame-changer\u201d Ocasio-Cortez is, you need only look at this front page: It\u2019s incredible: Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s remark about 70% marginal tax rates on the rich was delivered offhand in an interview. It immediately sparked a national political debate about taxes. Paul Krugman weighed in to say that taxing extremely high incomes made sound economic sense. Jeff Stein of the Washington Post laid out some of the ways that this money could be used: It could come close to funding the entirety of Sanders\u2019s free college tuition plan ($800bn), fund President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to get close to universal prekindergarten ($75bn over a decade), forgive more than half the student debt in America ($1.4tn), cover Democratic leaders\u2019 plan for boosting teacher pay and school funding ($100bn), or come close to funding a $1tn infrastructure plan. If Ocasio-Cortez hadn\u2019t made the remark, there would be no discussion. But she did, and so now there\u2019s a discussion! Now Nobel prize winners are publicly pointing out that high taxes are good, and moderate Democrats are being pressured to endorse \u201cradical\u201d ideas. As the New York Times reported, she is pushing the Democrats to the left whether they like it or not. She has realized what Republicans have known for a long time: if people are talking about your agenda, even if they\u2019re talking about how bad and silly it is, you are making that agenda more plausible. (It\u2019s often called \u201cshifting the Overton window\u201d.) Yes, the National Review will squeal that X tax hike won\u2019t be enough to pay for Y program. But you have got them on the defensive. I\u2019ll admit, when Ocasio-Cortez was elected, I was worried. In 2008, a lot of people my age fell in love with Barack Obama, and suffered bitter disappointment when he started listening to Larry Summers instead of Cornel West. Many of us became cynical: we learned not to put much faith in dynamic young leaders, because as soon as they get into power, they will inevitably become just like all the others: they will start issuing excuses for why political constraints make it simply impossible to change anything, and while you won\u2019t be able to prove they\u2019re wrong, you will come to suspect that they aren\u2019t really trying very hard. But so far, thank God, Ocasio-Cortez has been an inspiring exception to this. She made it clear that her loyalties weren\u2019t with the Democratic leadership but rather the protesters occupying the offices of the Democratic leadership. She told us what really goes on in Congress: when Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics held a seminar for incoming congresspeople, in which business leaders told them not to rock the boat, Ocasio-Cortez revealed all. You\u2019re not supposed to do that \u2013 you\u2019re supposed to handle your concerns quietly within the House, not open up to your constituents about them. They say that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand how the place works\u201d. But it seems more like they\u2019re the ones who don\u2019t understand how building power works. The Politico report offers a useful insight into how insider Democratic politics work \u2013 the article is full of long-serving Democrats grousing that the upstart Ocasio-Cortez has dared to suggest that some of them aren\u2019t doing a very good job. Apparently they keep trying to take her aside and give her that age-old speech: It\u2019s very well for you to be a radical on the campaign trail, but now that you\u2019re in Congress you need to stop making waves and let us show you how things are done. As one said: \u201cI think she needs to give herself an opportunity to know her colleagues and to give herself a sense of the chemistry of the body before passing judgment on anyone or anything.\u201d You can see, then, why the Democratic party ends up being so disappointing. You shouldn\u2019t pass judgment on anyone or anything when you get to Congress. Even though the congressional Democratic party has utterly failed to grapple with climate change, the great existential problem of our time! Politico reports that \u201cwhen House majority leader Steny Hoyer told reporters that a new climate committee that Ocasio-Cortez championed would not have subpoena power, she retweeted the news and chastised Democratic leadership\u201d. She said: \u201cOur goal is to treat climate change like the serious, existential threat it is by drafting an ambitious solution on the scale necessary \u2013 AKA a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d \u2013 to get it done. A weak committee misses the point and endangers people.\u201d This is absolutely true. She is right. Climate action has to be serious, and if Democrats in Congress won\u2019t be serious, they need to be called on it! Arguments in defense of the status quo are usually presented pragmatically: don\u2019t push too hard because it will hurt your goals. We\u2019re on your side, we\u2019re looking out for your interests, we just have a better way of getting things done. You can see exactly this in how House Democrats are trying to keep Ocasio-Cortez from endorsing their primary opponents: In private conversations with Ocasio-Cortez over the past few months, [Representative Nydia] Vel\u00e1zquez counseled Ocasio-Cortez against targeting her Democratic colleagues in future elections. The two had a \u2018long, long conversation\u2019 about the dynamics of Congress and Washington, and how there shouldn\u2019t be a \u2018litmus test\u2019 for every district. Vel\u00e1zquez told Ocasio-Cortez she should think twice in the future before backing primaries against her colleagues. [Stephanie] Murphy, the first Vietnamese woman elected to Congress, represents a swing district and could lose her seat if she\u2019s forced to move left in a primary, Vel\u00e1zquez said during the talk. This is concerning, of course. In order to get Democrats in Congress to move left, there have to be primary threats. This, historically, is one way socialists have won victories in the United States: they have forced the major political parties to move leftward in order to neutralize the socialist threat. It\u2019s not surprising that Ocasio-Cortez is being asked not to \u201cundermine\u201d fellow Democrats, but it\u2019s encouraging that so far she seems to be going her own way. Politico says that while she is cordial to her fellow party members, she does not give in: She\u2019s very friendly in person, chatting up fellow lawmakers and security workers in the Capitol as she\u2019s tailed by admirers and reporters. Then they see the Ocasio-Cortez on Twitter, where she frequently snaps at critics and occasionally at fellow Democrats. What the reporter calls \u201csnapping\u201d, I call \u201cbeing frank and honest about what is actually going on in Washington\u201d. And I dearly hope she keeps doing it, and isn\u2019t intimidated by colleagues who think she needs to be more meek and deferential. There is a lot of dismissal of Ocasio-Cortez for her bluntness on Twitter, but I have to say, among the young lefties I know, many adore her for being witty, smart and combative on social media. She does not take crap, and we have spent so long waiting for someone who \u201cgives as good as she gets\u201d. The tweets may be snarky, but they get to the point, and they finally make us feel as if we\u2019re on the side doing the \u201cdunking\u201d rather than the side being \u201cdunked on\u201d. When Chris Cillizza of CNN lied about manipulating a quote from her, she demanded accountability. When PolitiFact disproportionately focuses on her over the president\u2019s propagandists, she calls them on it. Her remarks are keeping her in the news, but more importantly, they\u2019re keeping her agenda in the news. Conservatives cannot stop talking about Ocasio-Cortez. Sean Hannity literally repeats her agenda on live television and then thinks he\u2019s the one winning! She drives them up the wall, and it\u2019s fantastic. But there\u2019s one person who never mentions her: Donald Trump. Strange, isn\u2019t it? Trump mocks everyone on Twitter. But he has never once sent a tweet about her, even though they both have major presences on the platform. I suspect I know exactly why: he realizes that she\u2019s better at this than him. He may be able to make jokes at the expense of Elizabeth Warren, but Ocasio-Cortez is better at online repartee than almost anyone else. He is wise to keep away from tangling with her. Just recently, when Joe Lieberman made a patronizing comment about Ocasio-Cortez not representing the future of the party, she gave a brief but devastating retort that made him look like an out-of-touch fogey. (I doubt he even understood it.) There are other reasons people my age have truly been enjoying watching Ocasio-Cortez in action. For one thing, she\u2019s capable of talking about immigration without making arguments about how Democrats are the real party of border security. She bluntly sticks up for progressive values, rather than timidly using conservative premises. She\u2019s not always perfectly polished, but I feel as if she\u2019s on my side and won\u2019t back down, which is something millennial leftists really need right now. My desperate, pleading hope is that instead of succumbing to the inevitable pressure from congressional peers \u2013 moderate your rhetoric, \u201cget serious\u201d, don\u2019t criticize the party \u2013 she doubles down and keeps kicking ass. She\u2019s already showing how we can successfully change the conversation: the Green New Deal, like Medicare for All, has gone from marginal to mainstream within a matter of months. Politico makes it clear: fellow Democrats are scared, and that\u2019s exactly how it should be. Now we need Ocasio-Cortezes everywhere, young Democratic Socialists of America lefties in office who will not be intimidated by the advice of the wise elders to slow down, calm down, shut up. We will remember what Martin Luther King said: when the pragmatic liberals say \u201cwait\u201d, they almost always mean \u201cnever\u201d.

Like all marketing gambits, that should perhaps be taken with a pinch of salt.

He did it with Greggs\u2019 vegan sausage roll, helping catapult their January marketing wheeze onto the front pages by complaining that it was a monstrosity. And he\u2019s done it again with the new Gillette ad targeting toxic masculinity, which twists its familiar \u201cthe best a man can get\u201d tagline to suggest that men can do a lot better than Harvey Weinstein and fighting in the street. It ends on a heroic note, with images of men in general and fathers in particular showing their sons a better way. But that didn\u2019t stop Morgan dismissing it as \u201cabsurd virtue-signalling PC guff\u201d that might drive him to get his razors elsewhere. \u201cLet boys be damn boys. Let men be damn men,\u201d he harrumphed on Twitter. The ad clearly has offended some male customers who take deep exception to being lumped in with gropers and thugs. It\u2019s certainly a far cry from the approach of women\u2019s brands, which generally seek to woo their customers with feelgood, body-positive campaigns rather than awkward truths. But if the aim was to generate oodles of free publicity by whipping up controversy, then like the vegan sausage roll it worked. Anything to get the brand name out there, in an era when customers fast-forward through the adverts while watching TV on catchup and use ad-blockers online. And crucially by pitting older men like Morgan against more woke millennials young enough to be their sons, it may have helped reposition an established brand that was in danger of starting to look old-fashioned as something more cutting edge. (It won\u2019t have done itself any harm at all with mothers of teenage sons buying razor blades on their behalf, either). Gillette is solemnly insisting that it\u2019s not just a stunt; that in addition to the ad it will be putting money into projects to \u201cinspire and educate\u201d men of all ages, and routinely challenge male stereotypes in the images and words it chooses. Like all marketing gambits, that should perhaps be taken with a pinch of salt. And it should go without saying that one slightly mawkish advert for razor blades is not going to make a difference to London\u2019s knife crime problem or force a perpetrator of domestic violence to change his ways. But the culture in which boys are steeped still matters, and it shouldn\u2019t be left to women to make that point. This has to be an argument in which men themselves get involved, and the point where many men do start thinking about it is when they become fathers. We\u2019re witnessing something deeply troubling about the expectations with which too many boys are being raised, something evident not only in the #MeToo revelations or in cases like the recent rape trial involving Irish rugby players but in men\u2019s infinitely greater predisposition to committing violent crime. And that should worry parents of boys as much as it does parents of girls. Feminism has endlessly opened up horizons for girls, giving them permission to be anything they want to be. They are bombarded with messages about how it\u2019s fine to be both smart and pretty, encouraged to visualise themselves in male-dominated careers and to push the boundaries of behaviour considered \u201cacceptable\u201d for women. That paves the way for girls who never fitted the pink princess stereotype to be far more comfortable in their skins. But expectations of boys have remained more rigid, to the detriment both of those who don\u2019t fit the macho stereotype and of those who will grow up to be the victims of insecure male rage. \u201cLet boys be boys\u201d is an excellent principle. But only if we recognise the full range of things boys are capable of being, when we let them. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

Measures by the government \u2013 which have even included the bombing of foreign vessels fishing illegally in Indonesian waters \u2013 have helped fish stocks more than double in the last five years. But now the industry has reached another important milestone: one of Indonesia\u2019s tuna fisheries has become the first in the country \u2013 and second in south-east Asia \u2013 to achieve the gold standard for sustainable practices. The PT Crac Sorong pole and line skipjack and yellowfin tuna fishery, based in the province of West Papua, has been certified by the internationally recognised Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) standard for sustainable fishing. The fishery, which has become a beacon of best practice in the region, runs 35 pole and line fishing vessels and employs 750 local fishers. \u201cThe efforts made by the fishery to achieve MSC certification will help safeguard livelihoods, seafood supplies and healthy oceans for future generations,\u201d said Patrick Caleo, Asia Pacific director at the MSC. \u201cWe hope to see other fisheries follow their lead by joining the global movement for seafood sustainability.\u201d PT Crac\u2019s new status will create fresh opportunities within the export market. The UK\u2019s Sainsbury\u2019s and Switzerland\u2019s largest retailer, Migros, are among companies that have already committed to the preferential sourcing of certified Indonesian pole and line products. \u201cWe work hard to provide our customers with sustainable seafood products, which is why Migros has committed to preferentially sourcing MSC-certified one-by-one tuna from Indonesia,\u201d said Adrian Lehmann, one of the company\u2019s buyers. Traditional pole and line fishing has been carried out in Indonesia for many generations. Ali Wibisono, the CEO at PT Crac, said the fishery had employed sustainable practices since it was founded in 1975. However, to meet the international standard it was necessary to collect extensive data, implementing an observer programme on the vessels to report on tuna and baitfish catches and interaction with vulnerable species. Wibisono told the Guardian: \u201cHaving that first certification \u2013 hopefully, the first of many for Indonesia \u2013 is a proud moment and really puts us on the map. It is an important milestone for the country but the sustainability of our resources goes beyond the certification. \u201cOur fisheries also have great importance for the people of Indonesia, providing many jobs, food and supporting livelihoods.\u201d He said 25% of the fishery\u2019s tuna goes to the local market while each of the 750 fishermen will take some of the catch home to their family. The certification will boost the reputation of the Sorong product on the export market as well as having a positive impact on the labour market locally. \u201cThere will be work opportunities for fishermen in the pole and line fleets and also the workers in Sorong\u2019s fish factory,\u201d said Wibisono. \u201cThis will attract non-pole and line fisheries to follow our lead and improve the economic turnover in the region.\u201d Globally, tuna fisheries have an annual value of more than $40bn (\u00a331bn), making improved conservation of the species critical to sustaining marine ecosystems and coastal communities who rely on the industry for food and income. Indonesia produces more tuna than any other country in the world with total landings of more than 620,000 metric tonnes in 2014, according to the latest data published by the Pew Charitable Trusts. The majority of tuna landed worldwide is taken by fishing vessels using large purse seine nets to encircle schools of fish, primarily targeting skipjack and yellowfin tuna. While purse seiners operating in the Indonesian economic zone are responsible for the biggest catches, their environmental impact is much greater than pole and line fisheries, which account for 50,000 metric tonnes a year, according to government estimates. \u201cThe purse seiners are responsible for a higher bycatch and are not as well regulated as what we refer to as the one-by-one tuna fisheries,\u201d explained Martin Purves, managing director of UK-based charity the International Pole &amp; Line Foundation (IPNLF), which has supported fisheries in Indonesia and worldwide. \u201cOur philosophy of one hook, one line, one fish at a time \u2013 using pole and line, handline or troll line behind the boat \u2013 is recognised as being the most sustainable model,\u201d he said. The IPNLF has this week released a film about sustainable tuna fishing. Following its work with PT Crac, the organisation is supporting a further six fisheries in Indonesia to help them achieve MSC certification by mid-2020. Purves said: \u201cWe have had support from 12 of our supply chain members which have signed a joint letter urging fisheries they will switch from any non-MSC tuna to one-by-one tuna from those fisheries in Indonesia reaching MSC certification. That is quite a strong commitment from the market.\u201d In the past, Indonesia has been seen as a country with lots of small vessels operating without proper management, but steps taken by the ministry of maritime affairs and fisheries (MMAF) have started to bear fruit, said Purves. \u201cThe fisheries minister Susi Pudjiastuti has taken a worldwide lead in terms of addressing illegal fishing in a country that has had major issues in this area,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of it has been quite public campaigns where vessels have been confiscated or set alight at sea and bombed. But in addition to publicity-grabbing efforts there has been a lot done to improve the legislative framework and great work on transparency.\u201d Indonesia was the first country in the world to publicly share the positions of its fishing fleets on the public online platform Global Fishing Watch, which uses satellite technology to give real-time tracking information for 70,000 of the world\u2019s largest fishing boats. In 2014 the MMAF introduced a raft of changes to manage Indonesia\u2019s marine resources, including banning fishing using foreign capital and the use of destructive fishing gear, including trawl nets. Trian Yunanda, deputy director at the ministry, told the Guardian the policies had led to increased fish stocks and and improvement in the prosperity of fishermen and coastal communities, according to figures for 2016 and 2017. \u201cThe data shows that our traditional and small-scale fisheries have benefited, and their catch has double, from the implemented policy,\u201d explained Yunanda. He added: \u201cThe MSC certification of PT Crac has motivated other tuna fisheries in Indonesia to develop fish improvement projects to address their negative environmental impacts and look at ways to improve.\u201d",

The new head coach of Solihull Moors Ladies, who play in Division One Midlands of the Women\u2019s National League, has worked hard for this opportunity \u2013 harder than most have to because the 34-year-old is not only a woman working in a profession dominated by men but has also had to battle racial and religious stereotyping and abuse as a Pakistani Muslim.</p> <p>She strives to avoid being defined by those labels, craving the day when her talent is all anyone notices.

All they saw was my work on the pitch and how I\u2019d developed players.\u201d</p> <p>After doing well with the youth sides Zaidi was offered the chance to add the women\u2019s team to her workload \u2013 she will remain head coach of the Under-16 boys\u2019 elite players, the Under-13 boys\u2019 technical coach and Under-9s\u2019 head coach. In her first game in the new job, a 2-1 defeat by Birmingham and West Midlands Ladies last Sunday, Zaidi got a first look at the scale of her task.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s national daily newspapers have played a key role in shaping the debate on Brexit. This is what they have said in their editorial columns \u2013 and on Tuesday\u2019s front pages \u2013 regarding Theresa May\u2019s deal with Brussels on leaving the EU. The Sun The Sun is highly critical of Theresa May\u2019s deal but has so far stopped short of formally endorsing a no-deal exit from the EU. Instead, it has suggested that any attempt by remainers to pursue a softer Brexit would be seen as a betrayal of the EU referendum result, cause the government to collapse, and give control of Downing Street to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s \u201canti-western Marxist rabble\u201d. \u201cIf this remainer-stuffed government nullifies or destroys Brexit they can kiss goodbye to their jobs and their party,\u201d the paper\u2019s editorial said last week. On Tuesday, the paper kicks the can a little further down the road, choosing to focus on a suggestion the prime minister believes she could force a second vote if she loses. Notably, the story is not the most prominent on the Sun\u2019s front. Daily Mail Since remain-supporting Geordie Greig took over the editorship from Paul Dacre in September, the Daily Mail has stuck closely to the Downing Street line on Brexit and backed May\u2019s deal with Brussels as a solution to the \u201clooming shambles\u201d of a no-deal exit. The newspaper has repeatedly warned against attempts to overturn the result while insisting a Corbyn government is the real threat to Britain\u2019s future. The front of Tuesday\u2019s edition is dominated by a clarion call \u2013 not an uncommon occurrence for the paper when the stakes are high \u2013 for MPs to back the \u201cimperfect\u201d deal. It is time to focus on other matters, the paper says, denouncing the parlous state of some of the country\u2019s public services and infrastructure. Greig\u2019s former paper, the Mail on Sunday, has taken a pro-Brexit stance under its new editor, Ted Verity, albeit making it clear that \u201cwe cannot leave without a deal\u201d. Daily Telegraph The pro-Brexit newspaper owned by the Barclay brothers has been strongly critical of May\u2019s deal, warning that any attempt to delay Britain\u2019s exit from the EU would result in political radicalisation and a possible Corbyn government.

A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, AKA Julius Dubose, knocks rapper 21 Savage from the top of the Billboard 200 chart. 21 Savage set the previous record low just one week previously \u2013 his album I Am &gt; I Was sold 3,481 non-streaming copies versus 84m streams. The data shows how, certainly among the youth demographics that dominate rap\u2019s fanbase, the market for digital downloads is rapidly diminishing. Data from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry found that while global digital revenues grew 19% in 2017, download revenues dropped by 20%. Nielsen Music then found that in the first half of 2018, the number of single song downloads in the US dropped by 27%, while album downloads fell by 22% \u2013 streams increased 42% in the same period. Rumours frequently circulate about Apple phasing out its iTunes download store. Apple Music executive Jimmy Iovine has said the decision would be made \u201cwhen people stop buying \u2013 it\u2019s very simple\u201d. CD sales dropped 47% year on year in the US, while in the UK in 2018, 32m CDs were sold, a drop of 23% (9.6m) year on year.",

Brexiters have been particularly angered by the backstop, an insurance arrangement to keep the UK in an effective customs union until a solution is found to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland, because it does not have a firm end date and cannot be exited unilaterally. On Monday, May issued one final call to parliament to back her, urging MPs to \u201ctake a second look\u201d at her deal, but there was little evidence in the debate in the House of Commons that followed that many had been convinced. The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, will open the final day of debate on Tuesday, which will be closed by May herself. Voting is set to begin on a series of amendments from 7pm. Downing Street has suggested the prime minister will make an immediate statement after the vote result is announced. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is expected to call a no-confidence vote in May shortly after the defeat.

The amendment, which would have rejected May\u2019s deal and a no-deal Brexit, would have made it impossible for the vote on May\u2019s deal itself to go ahead if it had passed. Government whips had suggested MPs who hoped to spare May the humiliation of a three-figure defeat on her Brexit deal should vote for the amendment submitted by Benn. Another amendment tabled by the Tory backbencher Andrew Murrison which aims to put a \u201csunset clause\u201d on the backstop arrangements in the withdrawal agreement is also gathering steam among Tory loyalists. The amendment has been signed by a number of senior Tories, including Sir Graham Brady, Damian Green and Robert Goodwill, suggesting it has some tacit whips\u2019 support.

Cousins, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green all played in that game. Andre Iguodala, an All Star just once, in 2012, is the slouch of the bunch, which is why on this team he comes off the bench. Despite lousy shooting seasons so far from Thompson and Green, the Warriors are still the NBA\u2019s top offense and, at least when Green is on the floor, the league\u2019s top defense. Sure, <a href=\"https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2018/11/22/18107971/nba-2018-golden-state-warriors-four-game-losing-streak-steph-curry\">they\u2019re losing games at a faster rate</a>, by far, than at any other point during their present run as the league\u2019s best team. But we\u2019ve all seen this movie before. They\u2019re bored, they will be for another two months, and it\u2019s <em>fine</em>. They\u2019re fine. You\u2019d have to be an idiot to bet against the Warriors this season.</p> <p>But let\u2019s say you\u2019re an idiot. Let\u2019s say you really think this is the year it all ends. And you\u2019re not even counting on someone\u2019s knee blowing out to open the door for a lucky challenger, or some kind of internal meltdown that ends with Green in a straitjacket and <a href=\"https://www.sny.tv/knicks/news/knicks-will-go-after-kevin-durant-who-says-he-can-play-anywhere-in-the-world/285497868\">KD in Madison Square Garden</a> (please, please, please). You just think, again, idiotically, that someone is going to beat the Warriors on the floor, at even strength, fair and square. You just think they\u2019re going to <em>lose</em>.</p> <p>And if you are that idiot, you should also take some comfort in the fact that you\u2019re starting to get company from a lot of non-idiots, including the esteemed Zach Lowe, whose refusal to rule it out last week \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not there yet\u201d \u2013 was telling in its own right. Maybe if we work backwards \u2013 if we pre-reverse engineer a Warriors defeat \u2013 we can imagine how it happens?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/11/raptors-nba-kawhi-leonard-success\">Will the Raptors end Toronto's difficult relationship with winning?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a matter of fact, we can. The only way to beat the Warriors hasn\u2019t changed since the Warriors became the Warriors: you have to pummel them. Bruise them. Foul them. If you can\u2019t beat them, beat them<em> up</em>. This is actually how you topple every dynasty and knock off every seemingly invincible foe, from Michael Jordan to Tom Brady to Ivan Drago. The plodding, punishing Pat Riley Knicks of the 90s were a direct reaction to MJ \u2013 knocking Air Jordan out of the sky didn\u2019t wind up working, but it was the closest anyone ever came. The New York Giants <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/feb/06/new-york-giants-beat-patriots-super-bowl\">beat Tom Brady twice in the Super Bowl</a> by hitting him over and over again; during the second loss, Brady said facing the Giants defensive line was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rapsheet/statuses/167437802626228224\">\u201clike throwing in a forest, dude.\u201d</a> Rocky spent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8nC-RnETd0\">an entire fight pounding Drago in the gut</a> before moving in for the kill.</p> <p>And in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/20/cleveland-cavaliers-win-nba-title-golden-state-warriors-game-7-nba-finals\">when the Cavs took down the Warriors</a>, they tossed around a gimpy Steph Curry like a chew toy. They\u2019d set hard screens to get LeBron James the ball in isolation against Curry, and then James would bull through him to the hoop. They\u2019d chip him around every corner, put extra sauce on every foul, a knee to every thigh. By the end of that series, Curry\u2019s body was so mangled and his knee so busted even Kevin Love could handle him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0742c8e5a2ae32dc0cd57827a8b0b1ac7329b313\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0742c8e5a2ae32dc0cd57827a8b0b1ac7329b313/0_23_2959_2022/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In the 2016 finals, the Cavaliers physically dominated Steph Curry.

It became a blueprint for beating the Warriors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bob Donnan/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This has been the blueprint for slowing down Curry, and the Warriors, ever since. You can\u2019t stop them, but you can make them bleed on every basket. Ironically, the addition of Durant, who is so tall and skinny he\u2019s practically two-dimensional, only made this strategy more alluring. Green is made of wrought iron, but if he\u2019s your thickest player, you\u2019ve got a very thin team. A few of the league\u2019s top teams are able to outmuscle Golden State, not because the Warriors lack physical toughness but because they lack muscles. They\u2019re just not that strong.</p> <p>This is Golden State\u2019s only true vulnerability. Besides an injury or two, this is the only thing that can stop them from winning the title. And a couple of the Eastern Conference\u2019s best teams are built to exploit that weakness. The Toronto Raptors, in particular, have giant swooping condors all over the court \u2013 Kawhi Leonard, of course, but also young bottle rockets Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby, plus hydrant-shaped bulldog Kyle Lowry at the point of attack. The Raptors are bigger and stronger than the Warriors, and they\u2019re younger and hungrier than the Cavs were last season. If Toronto reach the finals, they\u2019ll be Golden State\u2019s stiffest challenge yet, including the LeBron-led team they lost to three years ago.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the problem with this disaster scenario, though: the Warriors already have the solution on their roster, and he rejoins the line-up in a few days. No one knows what Cousins will look like when he resumes playing, only that he will be somewhere south of 100%. But we do know he\u2019ll still be country strong, he\u2019ll still be 275lbs, and he\u2019ll still have a mean streak the length of the Pacific Coast Highway. The presence of even one monster big man will have a cascading impact on the otherwise skimpy Warriors. He\u2019ll patch the one hole this team have left simply by taking the floor. And unlike the rest of his teammates, he has everything to prove, and everything to lose. No one will be pushing Cousins around.</p> <p>In reality, the only thing that\u2019s changed halfway through this NBA season is how we view Cousins\u2019s role on the Warriors. Heading into the season, he was an indulgence \u2013 a new trick for a bunch of bored old dogs, an insurance policy they\u2019d never have to cash in. But not anymore. No one is going to knock off Golden State this year. It\u2019s as idiotic as ever to think otherwise. But they didn\u2019t cruise all the way last season, and they\u2019re not going to cruise all the way this season. Cousins was supposed to be their cherry on top. Instead, he may have to save them.</p>",

Andre Iguodala, an All Star just once, in 2012, is the slouch of the bunch, which is why on this team he comes off the bench. Despite lousy shooting seasons so far from Thompson and Green, the Warriors are still the NBA\u2019s top offense and, at least when Green is on the floor, the league\u2019s top defense. Sure, they\u2019re losing games at a faster rate, by far, than at any other point during their present run as the league\u2019s best team. But we\u2019ve all seen this movie before. They\u2019re bored, they will be for another two months, and it\u2019s fine. They\u2019re fine. You\u2019d have to be an idiot to bet against the Warriors this season. But let\u2019s say you\u2019re an idiot. Let\u2019s say you really think this is the year it all ends. And you\u2019re not even counting on someone\u2019s knee blowing out to open the door for a lucky challenger, or some kind of internal meltdown that ends with Green in a straitjacket and KD in Madison Square Garden (please, please, please). You just think, again, idiotically, that someone is going to beat the Warriors on the floor, at even strength, fair and square. You just think they\u2019re going to lose. And if you are that idiot, you should also take some comfort in the fact that you\u2019re starting to get company from a lot of non-idiots, including the esteemed Zach Lowe, whose refusal to rule it out last week \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not there yet\u201d \u2013 was telling in its own right. Maybe if we work backwards \u2013 if we pre-reverse engineer a Warriors defeat \u2013 we can imagine how it happens? As a matter of fact, we can. The only way to beat the Warriors hasn\u2019t changed since the Warriors became the Warriors: you have to pummel them. Bruise them. Foul them. If you can\u2019t beat them, beat them up. This is actually how you topple every dynasty and knock off every seemingly invincible foe, from Michael Jordan to Tom Brady to Ivan Drago. The plodding, punishing Pat Riley Knicks of the 90s were a direct reaction to MJ \u2013 knocking Air Jordan out of the sky didn\u2019t wind up working, but it was the closest anyone ever came. The New York Giants beat Tom Brady twice in the Super Bowl by hitting him over and over again; during the second loss, Brady said facing the Giants defensive line was \u201clike throwing in a forest, dude.\u201d Rocky spent an entire fight pounding Drago in the gut before moving in for the kill. And in 2016, when the Cavs took down the Warriors, they tossed around a gimpy Steph Curry like a chew toy. They\u2019d set hard screens to get LeBron James the ball in isolation against Curry, and then James would bull through him to the hoop. They\u2019d chip him around every corner, put extra sauce on every foul, a knee to every thigh. By the end of that series, Curry\u2019s body was so mangled and his knee so busted even Kevin Love could handle him. This has been the blueprint for slowing down Curry, and the Warriors, ever since. You can\u2019t stop them, but you can make them bleed on every basket. Ironically, the addition of Durant, who is so tall and skinny he\u2019s practically two-dimensional, only made this strategy more alluring. Green is made of wrought iron, but if he\u2019s your thickest player, you\u2019ve got a very thin team. A few of the league\u2019s top teams are able to outmuscle Golden State, not because the Warriors lack physical toughness but because they lack muscles. They\u2019re just not that strong. This is Golden State\u2019s only true vulnerability. Besides an injury or two, this is the only thing that can stop them from winning the title. And a couple of the Eastern Conference\u2019s best teams are built to exploit that weakness. The Toronto Raptors, in particular, have giant swooping condors all over the court \u2013 Kawhi Leonard, of course, but also young bottle rockets Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby, plus hydrant-shaped bulldog Kyle Lowry at the point of attack. The Raptors are bigger and stronger than the Warriors, and they\u2019re younger and hungrier than the Cavs were last season. If Toronto reach the finals, they\u2019ll be Golden State\u2019s stiffest challenge yet, including the LeBron-led team they lost to three years ago. Here\u2019s the problem with this disaster scenario, though: the Warriors already have the solution on their roster, and he rejoins the line-up in a few days. No one knows what Cousins will look like when he resumes playing, only that he will be somewhere south of 100%. But we do know he\u2019ll still be country strong, he\u2019ll still be 275lbs, and he\u2019ll still have a mean streak the length of the Pacific Coast Highway. The presence of even one monster big man will have a cascading impact on the otherwise skimpy Warriors. He\u2019ll patch the one hole this team have left simply by taking the floor. And unlike the rest of his teammates, he has everything to prove, and everything to lose. No one will be pushing Cousins around. In reality, the only thing that\u2019s changed halfway through this NBA season is how we view Cousins\u2019s role on the Warriors. Heading into the season, he was an indulgence \u2013 a new trick for a bunch of bored old dogs, an insurance policy they\u2019d never have to cash in. But not anymore. No one is going to knock off Golden State this year. It\u2019s as idiotic as ever to think otherwise. But they didn\u2019t cruise all the way last season, and they\u2019re not going to cruise all the way this season. Cousins was supposed to be their cherry on top. Instead, he may have to save them.",

Her memories of Muguruza are clear and largely encouraging, however.</p> <p>The only time Muguruza beat Konta was in qualifying in Luxembourg seven years ago, when both were still searching for their identity on Tour.

She said later: \u201cIt\u2019s never easy, first round. I didn\u2019t know a lot about my opponent, because this is the first time we played each other.\u201d</p> <p>If that smacked of complacency, there will be no room for it against Konta, who goes in battle-hardened after taking nearly three hours to beat the combative Australian Ajla Tomljanovic in serious heat on Court No 3.</p> <p>Muguruza definitely remembers their match in New York, describing it as, \u201ca tough second round. She can play very well.\u201d Asked was she surprised that Konta has yo-yoed on the rankings, she said: \u201cNo, it\u2019s just tennis.\u201d Aggressive players, she observed, \u201chave good moments and not so good moments\u201d.</p> <p>Konta says of Muguruza: \u201cIf I have learned anything in the years I have been on Tour, it is anybody can play at the very highest level on any given day. And for someone to win two grand slam titles, still ranked in the top 20, she is a heck of a player.</p> <p>\u201c Going on court against anyone, you don\u2019t underestimate them, especially not someone like her. No I don\u2019t think she is vulnerable \u2013 I think she is doing very well and I am looking forward to playing her again.\u201d</p> <p>Pleasantries aside, Muguruza had by far the easier route to the second round. The prize for both is a probable path to at least the quarter-finals where the likely opponent will be Serena Williams, who could hardly have been more imposing in her first match here since winning the title in 2017 when seven weeks pregnant.</p> <p>The 37-year-old American needs one more major to match Margaret Court\u2019s all-time record of 24, and began her campaign on Tuesday by blitzing her neighbour back in Palm Beach, Tatjana Maria, 6-0, 6-2, in 49 minutes. In the next round she plays the Canadian Eugenie Bouchard who was way too good for the Chinese wildcard Peng Shuai, winning in just under an hour for the loss of three games.</p> <p>\u201cShe lives in the community next to me,\u201d Williams said of Maria. \u201cIt\u2019s nice. She\u2019s a really nice person. And her husband is really nice.

It was more than four months ago.</p> <p>However, when asked why she had avoided media commitments in a place where she has had so much success and which has always made her welcome (unlike one or two other places on the Tour over the years), she insisted it was to spend more time with her young daughter, Olympia. Sentiment is fine; but she has obligations as well, and sometimes this escapes her understanding.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the priority for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of what I do in Florida. I train and I go right home and I spend the rest of the day with my daughter. For now, as a working mom, I feel guilty. And I understand that\u2019s normal, but these are years I\u2019ll never get back. I just try to spend every moment that I can when I\u2019m not working with her.\u201d</p> <p>Fair enough, many will say. But she will need to be fully focused once the draw thins out and the opposition improves. Bouchard is determined to provide stiff resistance.</p> <p>\u201cI have had tough moments the past year, for sure, tough injuries,\u201d said Bouchard, who once was No 5 in the world and last year dipped as low as 194, arriving here ranked 79. \u201cWhen you lose early, it\u2019s less fun, of course, but I feel like I\u2019m improving.\u201d</p> <p>Williams says she cares nothing for rankings. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give myself a ranking anymore. It gives me too many negative expectations. I always expect to reach the sky. Anything below it is not good enough for me. I just know that I\u2019m going in the right direction.\u201d</p>",

Having lost to too many outsiders in big tournaments in the past, she is aware that danger lurks in every match. Her memories of Muguruza are clear and largely encouraging, however. The only time Muguruza beat Konta was in qualifying in Luxembourg seven years ago, when both were still searching for their identity on Tour. When it mattered, Konta got the better of her on the grass of Eastbourne in a seaside stroll in 2015, not far from her home, then prevailed on a wickedly hot day at Flushing Meadows a couple of months later to tip the Spaniard out of the US Open in three long sets. Muguruza, two years younger at 25 and 20 places above Konta in the rankings at 18, has the better record (six WTA titles, including two majors, to three and none) and has won more money ($18.2m to $7.2m), but she is beatable, even on the big stage, where nerves have often kicked in. Here Muguruza made it on to Court No 3 on Tuesday to account for Zheng Saisai, 6-2, 6-3, in an hour and a quarter. She said later: \u201cIt\u2019s never easy, first round. I didn\u2019t know a lot about my opponent, because this is the first time we played each other.\u201d If that smacked of complacency, there will be no room for it against Konta, who goes in battle-hardened after taking nearly three hours to beat the combative Australian Ajla Tomljanovic in serious heat on Court No 3. Muguruza definitely remembers their match in New York, describing it as, \u201ca tough second round. She can play very well.\u201d Asked was she surprised that Konta has yo-yoed on the rankings, she said: \u201cNo, it\u2019s just tennis.\u201d Aggressive players, she observed, \u201chave good moments and not so good moments\u201d. Konta says of Muguruza: \u201cIf I have learned anything in the years I have been on Tour, it is anybody can play at the very highest level on any given day. And for someone to win two grand slam titles, still ranked in the top 20, she is a heck of a player. \u201c Going on court against anyone, you don\u2019t underestimate them, especially not someone like her. No I don\u2019t think she is vulnerable \u2013 I think she is doing very well and I am looking forward to playing her again.\u201d Pleasantries aside, Muguruza had by far the easier route to the second round. The prize for both is a probable path to at least the quarter-finals where the likely opponent will be Serena Williams, who could hardly have been more imposing in her first match here since winning the title in 2017 when seven weeks pregnant. The 37-year-old American needs one more major to match Margaret Court\u2019s all-time record of 24, and began her campaign on Tuesday by blitzing her neighbour back in Palm Beach, Tatjana Maria, 6-0, 6-2, in 49 minutes. In the next round she plays the Canadian Eugenie Bouchard who was way too good for the Chinese wildcard Peng Shuai, winning in just under an hour for the loss of three games. \u201cShe lives in the community next to me,\u201d Williams said of Maria. \u201cIt\u2019s nice. She\u2019s a really nice person. And her husband is really nice. Her family is sweet.\u201d It was tempting to wonder what she would have done to the German had they not been neighbours. So, she filled her post-match remarks with platitudes, flatly refusing to talk about her meltdown in the 2018 US Open final in September, which is perhaps understandable. It was more than four months ago. However, when asked why she had avoided media commitments in a place where she has had so much success and which has always made her welcome (unlike one or two other places on the Tour over the years), she insisted it was to spend more time with her young daughter, Olympia. Sentiment is fine; but she has obligations as well, and sometimes this escapes her understanding. \u201cThat\u2019s the priority for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of what I do in Florida. I train and I go right home and I spend the rest of the day with my daughter. For now, as a working mom, I feel guilty. And I understand that\u2019s normal, but these are years I\u2019ll never get back. I just try to spend every moment that I can when I\u2019m not working with her.\u201d Fair enough, many will say. But she will need to be fully focused once the draw thins out and the opposition improves. Bouchard is determined to provide stiff resistance. \u201cI have had tough moments the past year, for sure, tough injuries,\u201d said Bouchard, who once was No 5 in the world and last year dipped as low as 194, arriving here ranked 79. \u201cWhen you lose early, it\u2019s less fun, of course, but I feel like I\u2019m improving.\u201d Williams says she cares nothing for rankings. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give myself a ranking anymore. It gives me too many negative expectations. I always expect to reach the sky. Anything below it is not good enough for me. I just know that I\u2019m going in the right direction.\u201d",

You\u2019re going to love the sequel, Shape of You! Following Elisa\u2019s life with the Amphibian Man (here played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/aug/25/dirty-laundry-bleached-bumholes-and-reading-uni-the-secrets-behind-ed-sheerans-success\">Ed Sheeran</a>), the movie starts with a voiceover \u2013 which, yes, may anger some fans of the first film because there\u2019s a slight continuity error in that Elisa is no longer mute \u2013 detailing how the club isn\u2019t the best place to find a lover, so the river is where she went.

Cut to: Jamie Dornan, dead behind the eyes, whispering the lyrics: \u201cLet me trespass your danger zones / Until I make you scream / And you forget your last name / Despacito\u201d. Because this is the first time anyone\u2019s bothered to find out what the lyrics mean in English, it doesn\u2019t make mums horny, just makes them realise they\u2019ve been playing a song about shagging at their kids\u2019 birthday parties for the past year.</p> <h2>Havana: Camila Cabello</h2> <p>Finally out of Nicholas Sparks novels to adapt, and inspired by the success of films that romanticise serious illness and injury (Me Before You, A Walk to Remember, The Fault in Our Stars), cinema turns to Camila Cabello for its latest \u201chave a white wine in the cinema and a cry on the bus on the way home\u201d epic. Katherine Langford from 13 Reasons Why is Katie, a girl who, due to a horrific car accident on the way home from prom, is left with only half a heart.

Will Katie fall for the man who saved her life by giving her half a heart, or will Bobby steal her whole heart? Teens love it, seeing the movie 45 times in a row in cinemas and flooding the internet with fanfic, but the British Medical Council calls the plotline \u201ccompletely unbelievable\u201d, adding: \u201cPlease don\u2019t teach teenagers you can survive with half a heart.

He sat down with his family, put Journey on a jukebox and chomped on some onion rings. Then the screen went black. What happened after that \u2013 whether Tony was assassinated by the bloke who walked into the toilet moments before the blackout, or if he lived and had to listen to Meadow discuss her terrible parallel parking \u2013 is an unknown and will always remain so. As it should do.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/14/the-sopranos-at-20-how-the-hit-show-changed-the-gangster-genre\">The Sopranos at 20: how the hit show changed the gangster genre</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the end of last week, <a href=\"https://www.abramsbooks.com/product/sopranos-sessions_9781419734946/\">a book</a> \u2013 released to coincide with the show\u2019s 20th anniversary \u2013 made headlines for an interview with the series creator, David Chase, by the TV critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz. During the interview ,Chase referred to the final scene as the \u201cdeath scene\u201d and the \u201cfatal scene\u201d. That was enough for those who have trawled for an \u201canswer\u201d to what happened when the screen went black <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/jun/11/thesopranosthatsittheyren\">in June 2007</a> to start the ending engine up again. The Times dedicated a story to whether or not the issue of Tony Soprano\u2019s fate had finally been put to bed. Of course, it hasn\u2019t and isn\u2019t. In 2014, the <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/8/27/6006139/did-tony-die-at-the-end-of-the-sopranos\">Vox writer Martha P Nochimson</a> claimed Chase had told her that Tony wasn\u2019t dead. Finally, there was an answer. Until Chase released a statement saying the story was untrue and that the \u201cfinal scene of The Sopranos raises a spiritual question that has no right or wrong answer\u201d.</p> <p>The best culture doesn\u2019t hold our hand and map out every twist and turn. It is opaque at times and ambiguous. There\u2019s mystery. There are lingering doubts and unanswered questions. Just like in real life. Does not knowing for sure what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/25/citizen-kane-rosebud\">Rosebud meant</a> make Citizen Kane a terrible film? Would you respect David Lynch\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/06/twin-peaks-was-this-the-long-perfect-goodbye-from-david-lynch\">Twin Peaks</a> more if he revealed that Dale Cooper is <em>definitely</em> trapped in an endless loop of pain and apple pies? Should fans of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/12/how-we-made-2001-a-space-odyssey-stanley-kubrick-hal\">2001: A Space Odyssey</a> feel robbed because of its cosmic ending?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/20/lorraine-bracco-goodfellas-the-sopranos-martin-scorsese\">Dr Melfi</a> would probably call this obsession with Tony\u2019s fate an obsession with closure. When asked whether people who have spent hours and hours trawling over that final scene to try to \u201cprove\u201d that Tony is killed are wrong, Chase said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s my job.

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s get one thing straight. Tony Soprano didn\u2019t die at the end of The Sopranos. He sat down with his family, put Journey on a jukebox and chomped on some onion rings. Then the screen went black. What happened after that \u2013 whether Tony was assassinated by the bloke who walked into the toilet moments before the blackout, or if he lived and had to listen to Meadow discuss her terrible parallel parking \u2013 is an unknown and will always remain so. As it should do. At the end of last week, a book \u2013 released to coincide with the show\u2019s 20th anniversary \u2013 made headlines for an interview with the series creator, David Chase, by the TV critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz. During the interview ,Chase referred to the final scene as the \u201cdeath scene\u201d and the \u201cfatal scene\u201d. That was enough for those who have trawled for an \u201canswer\u201d to what happened when the screen went black in June 2007 to start the ending engine up again. The Times dedicated a story to whether or not the issue of Tony Soprano\u2019s fate had finally been put to bed. Of course, it hasn\u2019t and isn\u2019t. In 2014, the Vox writer Martha P Nochimson claimed Chase had told her that Tony wasn\u2019t dead. Finally, there was an answer. Until Chase released a statement saying the story was untrue and that the \u201cfinal scene of The Sopranos raises a spiritual question that has no right or wrong answer\u201d. The best culture doesn\u2019t hold our hand and map out every twist and turn. It is opaque at times and ambiguous. There\u2019s mystery. There are lingering doubts and unanswered questions. Just like in real life. Does not knowing for sure what Rosebud meant make Citizen Kane a terrible film? Would you respect David Lynch\u2019s Twin Peaks more if he revealed that Dale Cooper is definitely trapped in an endless loop of pain and apple pies? Should fans of 2001: A Space Odyssey feel robbed because of its cosmic ending? Dr Melfi would probably call this obsession with Tony\u2019s fate an obsession with closure. When asked whether people who have spent hours and hours trawling over that final scene to try to \u201cprove\u201d that Tony is killed are wrong, Chase said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s my job. They\u2019ve interpreted that scene that way. That should be a good thing, that there\u2019s different interpretations.\u201d In other words, the ambiguity is the whole point. Unfortunately for The Sopranos, so much oxygen is dedicated to the ending that it\u2019s easy to forget that Chase created seven seasons of the most well-wrought, funny and still mind-blowingly innovative television that has ever been created. In the \u201cdeath scene\u201d interview, Chase also mentions how parts of the final season were influenced by a combination of: Peter Matthiessen\u2019s The Snow Leopard, the films of Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, The Godfather, the power of dreams, and the song All That You Dream by Little Feat. Chase created a multi-layered world of intricacies that commented on everything from the myriad flaws of psychoanalysis, issues of race and class, homophobia, 9/11, the dangers of rampant machismo and creeping gentrification in New Jersey. And yet despite all that, the ending is something some fans just can\u2019t get past. Other shows from the so-called second golden age of TV don\u2019t have that problem. Breaking Bad tied everything up in a horrible bloody bow. The Wire was surprisingly conventional when it bowed out. Mad Men left the cynical ad man Don Draper on a Malibu cliff-top meditating while simultaneously coming up with the \u201cI\u2019d like to buy the world a Coke\u201d advert. Were they all perfect endings? No, but they are what the people who created the shows we loved chose them to be, and constantly rehashing and complaining about them is one of the worst excesses of bad fandom. Even when a finale is demonstrably bad \u2013 take the case of Seinfeld which has an ending that Larry David openly regrets \u2013 we as viewers have entered into a contract with the creative forces behind the show to accept their decisions, good and bad. There is another option. A future of choose-your-own-adventure Bandersnatch-style shows in which we\u2019re the director. But imagine if The Sopranos was down to us rather than Chase.

Reports say local rivals the Guardians of the State (GDE) and Family of the North (FDN), from Amazonas, have joined in \u2013 potentially setting up a dangerous wider alliance against authorities. Fortaleza, the state capital, has seen the worst unrest.</p> <p>O Povo news site reported that gangs were paying young people in poorer areas to commit crimes, with 1,000 reais (\u00a3210) to set fire to a bus and 5,000 reais for \u201ca fire of great proportions\u201d. Others are settling personal drug debts with acts of violence.</p> <p>Four hundred national guard have been sent to Fortaleza to restore order, the graduation of military police recruits has been speeded up and prisoners suspected of leading the unrest have been transferred out of the state. Police have taken more than 400 mobile phones from prisoners across Cear\u00e1, and <a href=\"https://www.sspds.ce.gov.br/\">there have been 358 arrests</a>.</p> <p>But, say critics, none of this will solve the structural crisis in Cear\u00e1\u2019s overcrowded prisons, where the insistence on criminalisation and mass incarceration have left around <a href=\"http://depen.gov.br/DEPEN/noticias-1/noticias/infopen-levantamento-nacional-de-informacoes-penitenciarias-2016/relatorio_2016_22111.pdf\">29,000 inmates</a> occupying spaces for about 11,000 people. Overcrowding makes it harder to uphold even basic rights for inmates, handing control to gangs. These gangs then feed a crime epidemic among young people who lack alternatives.</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t changed the prison policy for 30 years, and we just repeat the same mistakes,\u201d says Roseno, who heads a <a href=\"http://cadavidaimporta.com.br/publicacoes/every-life-matters-introduction/\">campaign to stop murders of adolescents</a>. \u201cThe government needs a policy of penal reform but it doesn\u2019t have one. A prison should aim to [reintegrate] the criminal into society, but only 5% of inmates are studying and only 7% are working \u2013 they need skills and education.\u201d</p> <p>Without investment and reform of the prison system, the cycle of violence and crime continues. \u201cIt is right for the state to re-engage with command of the prisons but [Albuquerque] made a mistake by saying he would not respect gangs without [having] a plan.\u201d</p> <p>Criminologist Sacha Darke, author of a new <a href=\"https://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9783319922096\">book </a>on Brazilian prisons, points out that Brazil\u2019s gangs originated in jails as inmates banded together for protection, and the practice of housing inmates with the local faction was started to stop them killing each other. \u201cIt is hard to see how they could run prisons without this system since prisoners protect each other, and there are far too few staff. Guards don\u2019t even go into cells so it would be an absolute nightmare to throw all [the inmates] in together.\u201d</p> <p>As well as providing more staff and resources for prisons, judicial practice must change in order to reduce mass incarceration, he says. Despite a law in 2006 decriminalising possession of a small amount of drugs for personal consumption, \u201cthey began prosecuting anyone found with drugs, [even] a small quantity at home, as if they were serious traffickers\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5ac3463bcf5e6bd8ef428b607d0019b0af830ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5ac3463bcf5e6bd8ef428b607d0019b0af830ac/22_0_3457_2075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Technicians work on the site where a power transmission tower was damaged by a bomb in the outskirts of Fortaleza\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Technicians work on the site where a power transmission tower was damaged by a bomb on the outskirts of Fortaleza.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paulo Whitaker/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This has contributed to a sharp rise in Brazil\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.prisonstudies.org/country/brazil\">prison population to 700,489</a> \u2013 the world\u2019s third largest. Of all inmates nationwide, 34.2% are on remand and Cear\u00e1 holds the record for most prisoners who have not been convicted of a crime. </p> <p>As drug gangs have migrated from Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo to a region offering an easy route to Europe, Cear\u00e1 has become one of the most violent states in a country that in 2017 broke its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/09/brazil-sets-new-record-for-homicides-63880-deaths\">own record for homicides</a>. But, say critics, authorities haven\u2019t taken this seriously enough or come up with smart, innovative policies to counter it.</p> <p>The current crisis is now a perfect storm as gang leaders in overstuffed jails prey on young people with \u201cno exit door from gangs\u201d, says Roseno, while Cear\u00e1\u2019s governor, Camilo Santana, from the leftwing Workers\u2019 Party (PT), is \u201cworried about not looking weak\u201d. So far the response of Santana has echoed the tough rhetoric of Bolsonaro, calling for military reinforcements and promising stern action in his <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/camilosantana/\">Facebook</a> posts.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the unrest has spread to 40 cities and on the streets of Fortaleza, there is little sign that either side is ready to back down. Local media have shown <a href=\"https://ponte.org/ataques-ao-governo-unem-faccoes-rivais-no-ceara/\">graffiti</a> in Fortaleza with the warning: \u201cWe will not stop until Albuquerque quits.\u201d</p> <p>Da Silva, a social worker with young people at risk of joining gangs, says many areas are now too dangerous for him and co-workers to enter. \u201cThe authorities cannot step back for fear of looking weak, but this is going to lead to more serious problems,\u201d Da Silva says. \u201cWhere is the intelligent response to these problems in Brazil? We have a super-ministry of security but where\u2019s the super-ministry of education?\u201d</p> <p>Luiz F\u00e1bio Paiva, a sociologist at the federal university of Cear\u00e1 and researcher with the <a href=\"http://lev.ufc.br/\">Laboratory for the Study of Violence</a> (LEV), says the assertions from the state government, which is \u201cpreoccupied excessively with manifesting and demonstrating a hyper-masculine show of fighting violence with violence\u201d, are reckless.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible to put these [factions] in the same prisons. You are going to have to deal with the burden of deaths that already happen and are going to increase,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Roseno says: \u201cThe question is: how can we reduce the power of the gangs? How can we not just get rid of the weapons and cut off financial resources but offer young people a different life? These gangs operate by offering a sense of brotherhood, self-esteem, money. They are filling the space where there are no public policies.\u201d</p>",

Four hundred national guard have been sent to Fortaleza to restore order, the graduation of military police recruits has been speeded up and prisoners suspected of leading the unrest have been transferred out of the state. Police have taken more than 400 mobile phones from prisoners across Cear\u00e1, and there have been 358 arrests. But, say critics, none of this will solve the structural crisis in Cear\u00e1\u2019s overcrowded prisons, where the insistence on criminalisation and mass incarceration have left around 29,000 inmates occupying spaces for about 11,000 people. Overcrowding makes it harder to uphold even basic rights for inmates, handing control to gangs. These gangs then feed a crime epidemic among young people who lack alternatives. \u201cWe haven\u2019t changed the prison policy for 30 years, and we just repeat the same mistakes,\u201d says Roseno, who heads a campaign to stop murders of adolescents. \u201cThe government needs a policy of penal reform but it doesn\u2019t have one. A prison should aim to [reintegrate] the criminal into society, but only 5% of inmates are studying and only 7% are working \u2013 they need skills and education.\u201d Without investment and reform of the prison system, the cycle of violence and crime continues. \u201cIt is right for the state to re-engage with command of the prisons but [Albuquerque] made a mistake by saying he would not respect gangs without [having] a plan.\u201d Criminologist Sacha Darke, author of a new book on Brazilian prisons, points out that Brazil\u2019s gangs originated in jails as inmates banded together for protection, and the practice of housing inmates with the local faction was started to stop them killing each other. \u201cIt is hard to see how they could run prisons without this system since prisoners protect each other, and there are far too few staff. Guards don\u2019t even go into cells so it would be an absolute nightmare to throw all [the inmates] in together.\u201d As well as providing more staff and resources for prisons, judicial practice must change in order to reduce mass incarceration, he says. Despite a law in 2006 decriminalising possession of a small amount of drugs for personal consumption, \u201cthey began prosecuting anyone found with drugs, [even] a small quantity at home, as if they were serious traffickers\u201d. This has contributed to a sharp rise in Brazil\u2019s prison population to 700,489 \u2013 the world\u2019s third largest. Of all inmates nationwide, 34.2% are on remand and Cear\u00e1 holds the record for most prisoners who have not been convicted of a crime. As drug gangs have migrated from Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo to a region offering an easy route to Europe, Cear\u00e1 has become one of the most violent states in a country that in 2017 broke its own record for homicides. But, say critics, authorities haven\u2019t taken this seriously enough or come up with smart, innovative policies to counter it. The current crisis is now a perfect storm as gang leaders in overstuffed jails prey on young people with \u201cno exit door from gangs\u201d, says Roseno, while Cear\u00e1\u2019s governor, Camilo Santana, from the leftwing Workers\u2019 Party (PT), is \u201cworried about not looking weak\u201d. So far the response of Santana has echoed the tough rhetoric of Bolsonaro, calling for military reinforcements and promising stern action in his Facebook posts. Meanwhile, the unrest has spread to 40 cities and on the streets of Fortaleza, there is little sign that either side is ready to back down. Local media have shown graffiti in Fortaleza with the warning: \u201cWe will not stop until Albuquerque quits.\u201d Da Silva, a social worker with young people at risk of joining gangs, says many areas are now too dangerous for him and co-workers to enter. \u201cThe authorities cannot step back for fear of looking weak, but this is going to lead to more serious problems,\u201d Da Silva says. \u201cWhere is the intelligent response to these problems in Brazil? We have a super-ministry of security but where\u2019s the super-ministry of education?\u201d Luiz F\u00e1bio Paiva, a sociologist at the federal university of Cear\u00e1 and researcher with the Laboratory for the Study of Violence (LEV), says the assertions from the state government, which is \u201cpreoccupied excessively with manifesting and demonstrating a hyper-masculine show of fighting violence with violence\u201d, are reckless. \u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible to put these [factions] in the same prisons. You are going to have to deal with the burden of deaths that already happen and are going to increase,\u201d he says. Roseno says: \u201cThe question is: how can we reduce the power of the gangs? How can we not just get rid of the weapons and cut off financial resources but offer young people a different life? These gangs operate by offering a sense of brotherhood, self-esteem, money. They are filling the space where there are no public policies.\u201d",

Unfortunately, it has become seen by too many inside the higher-education sector as the only way to admit students in an era when nearly 50% of young people, rather than 5%, are going.

Those who have the potential to get the grades needed to get into the more selective institutions with the strongest graduate outcomes are more likely to be predicted lower grades than they can achieve. The rest are left to navigate an increasingly complex system without the crucial advice that their peers with parents who navigated it can rely on.</p> <p>The faults in the present arrangements, however, are never more clearly highlighted than with the current concerns over unconditional offers. The numbers of students receiving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jul/26/rise-in-unconditional-offers-prompts-call-for-university-admissions-overhaul\" title=\"\">offers of places</a> has increased sevenfold since 2013. In the competition for students, universities are increasingly rejecting the idea that actual grades matter. The result, though, is another complexity in the system, and given the opaque way in which offer decisions are made, it is a complexity that looks increasingly unfair, as some students can coast through their A-levels with a place in the bag while their friends can\u2019t.</p> <p>University admissions do not have to be this way. We are the only major country in the world where students receive course offers on the basis of predicted grades. International comparisons have to be done carefully. In countries such as the US, for example, admission is based more on standard aptitude tests, which can be marked more quickly. Our content-heavy A-level examination means we have to allow sufficient time for exams to be marked accurately and securely. But this does not mean it\u2019s not possible to have a system that better supports students to make the right choices for them.</p> <p>In a report released this week, we at the National Education Opportunities Network <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/14/universities-should-give-offers-after-results-day-says-study\" title=\"\">argue that</a> it is time to develop a new university admissions system that enables students to make better decisions, and remove the anachronism of predicted grades. This system would recognise that decision-making regarding university entry begins far earlier than age 17 or 18 for young people, and it would provide information, advice and guidance from age 15 onwards. It would look abroad to learn from innovative practice in the Netherlands and pilot a study choice check \u2013 which is an online questionnaire all students would take before they apply that would measure what their expectations of the course were against the reality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/aug/16/clearing-shows-how-the-governments-university-market-has-failed\">Clearing shows how the government's university market has failed | David Morris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The aim is to avoid the mismatches that often lead to students under-performing or dropping out. The new system would likely eliminate the need for clearing, as students would be applying on actual grades and so would be able to apply for more courses. For first-year students the academic year will start a little later, giving them time to find accommodation if need be, and also meaning they can be well prepared for their entry into higher education, and that their needs can be focused on specifically, rather than lost in the noise of the start of a university term.</p> <p>The work needed to change university admissions can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be underestimated.

Unfortunately, it has become seen by too many inside the higher-education sector as the only way to admit students in an era when nearly 50% of young people, rather than 5%, are going. The consequence is that students are making decisions earlier than they need to, and those whose grades don\u2019t match the offer, are forced into the peculiarly homegrown phenomenon of clearing, where a decision that will shape your future career (and, given what we know about marriage patterns, your personal life as well), is made in a frenzied search at the end of August. This process places undue pressure on first-generation students and those from groups under-represented in higher education, such as care leavers. Those who have the potential to get the grades needed to get into the more selective institutions with the strongest graduate outcomes are more likely to be predicted lower grades than they can achieve. The rest are left to navigate an increasingly complex system without the crucial advice that their peers with parents who navigated it can rely on. The faults in the present arrangements, however, are never more clearly highlighted than with the current concerns over unconditional offers. The numbers of students receiving offers of places has increased sevenfold since 2013. In the competition for students, universities are increasingly rejecting the idea that actual grades matter. The result, though, is another complexity in the system, and given the opaque way in which offer decisions are made, it is a complexity that looks increasingly unfair, as some students can coast through their A-levels with a place in the bag while their friends can\u2019t. University admissions do not have to be this way. We are the only major country in the world where students receive course offers on the basis of predicted grades. International comparisons have to be done carefully. In countries such as the US, for example, admission is based more on standard aptitude tests, which can be marked more quickly. Our content-heavy A-level examination means we have to allow sufficient time for exams to be marked accurately and securely. But this does not mean it\u2019s not possible to have a system that better supports students to make the right choices for them. In a report released this week, we at the National Education Opportunities Network argue that it is time to develop a new university admissions system that enables students to make better decisions, and remove the anachronism of predicted grades. This system would recognise that decision-making regarding university entry begins far earlier than age 17 or 18 for young people, and it would provide information, advice and guidance from age 15 onwards. It would look abroad to learn from innovative practice in the Netherlands and pilot a study choice check \u2013 which is an online questionnaire all students would take before they apply that would measure what their expectations of the course were against the reality. The aim is to avoid the mismatches that often lead to students under-performing or dropping out. The new system would likely eliminate the need for clearing, as students would be applying on actual grades and so would be able to apply for more courses. For first-year students the academic year will start a little later, giving them time to find accommodation if need be, and also meaning they can be well prepared for their entry into higher education, and that their needs can be focused on specifically, rather than lost in the noise of the start of a university term. The work needed to change university admissions can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. But neither is it an excuse not to look seriously at what is not working and change it. \u2022 Dr Graeme Atherton is the director of the National Education Opportunities Network (NEON)",

For Scotland to have the chance of both its professional teams reaching Europe\u2019s last eight going into the final round of Champions Cup pool matches is as unprecedented as it is great news for a tournament which thrives on diversity. Sure, the leading Irish, French and English candidates are still in the mix but a double-whammy of Edinburgh and Glasgow really would be a collector\u2019s item.</p> <p>It is not always an easy life as a pro rugby player in Scotland. There are bigger bucks available elsewhere and, until this season, their major teams have reached the European quarter-finals just twice and once respectively in 22 years of trying. When Gregor Townsend names his Six Nations squad this week it will be from a position of collective psychological strength unparalleled since Jim Telfer\u2019s heyday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/14/champions-cup-talking-points-rugby-union\">Rugby union: talking points from the Champions Cup weekend action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Which, of course, begs a familiar question: does European form translate to the international stage? This time last year, when England were \u2013 as now \u2013 mostly underperforming in Europe, Eddie Jones was unimpressed by a headline in the Guardian \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/14/premiership-faltering-form-europe-could-spell-trouble-england-eddie-jones-rugby-union\" title=\"\">\u201cPremiership\u2019s faltering form in Europe could spell trouble for England\u201d</a> \u2013 suggesting it might impact on their 2018 Six Nations prospects. \u201cIf they\u2019re not successful at club level, it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be successful at international level,\u201d said Jones. Fair enough, but England\u2019s fifth-placed finish in the Six Nations did not exactly explode the notion of a legitimate link between European form in January and Test form immediately afterwards.</p> <p>This does not automatically mean that Scotland are about to win a grand slam, even if three of their first four fixtures are being played at Murrayfield this year. When expectations have been ramped up on Scottish sides in the recent past, they have not always responded positively. And yet. If a Lions party were touring this summer, Hamish Watson, Darcy Graham, Blair Kinghorn, Stuart McInally, WP Nel, Jonny Gray, Stuart Hogg and Finn Russell would all be legitimate contenders. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/13/exeter-chiefs-castres-champions-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Sam Skinner was excellent again for Exeter</a> on Sunday. Mix in a dash of Edinburgh\u2019s Richard Cockerill-engineered resilience and why would Scotland not be heading into the next couple of months feeling genuinely optimistic?</p> <p>Was it totally coincidental, too, that Ireland won a grand slam last season when their provinces were also riding high? This time around both Munster and Ulster have stepped up a gear from last season and Leinster, the defending European champions, are nicely placed to grab their customary home quarter-final draw. No one who saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/11/gloucester-munster-european-champions-cup-rugby-match-report\" title=\"\">Joey Carbery\u2019s masterclass at Kingsholm</a> on Friday night will need telling that Joe Schmidt has rare strength-in-depth at his disposal.</p> <p>Which nicely sets the scene for Jones\u2019s Six Nations squad announcement on Thursday. Gone are the days of England coaches naming squads in the breezy knowledge they were pretty much certain to finish in the top half of the table. And where does Jones turn for upbeat, in-form players on a roll with their clubs? Aside from Saracens and Exeter none of the Premiership\u2019s other five European contenders are remotely in the hunt with one round still to play.</p> <p>What happens, furthermore, if the Chiefs go to Munster this weekend and get munched by the home back row just as Gloucester were last Friday night? It would further strengthen the suspicion that players accustomed to the Premiership, relentless and punishing though it may be, are being outflanked by some of the more dynamic breakdown operators who ply their domestic trade elsewhere. Which is effectively what Jones is acknowledging every time he pointedly omits yet another prominent Premiership back-rower from his plans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19be0cf19173d2ddaee29f053191dba316b3d371\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19be0cf19173d2ddaee29f053191dba316b3d371/0_59_4092_2455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Wilson is probably the leading contender to play at No 6 for England in the Six Nations\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Wilson is probably the leading contender to play at No 6 for England in the Six Nations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the unfortunate Sam Underhill out injured that heaps an awful lot of pressure on Sale\u2019s Tom Curry. It is asking a lot to expect him to go to Dublin and single-handedly outplay Dan Leavy, Peter O\u2019Mahony (if fit), Se\u00e1n O\u2019Brien (ditto), CJ Stander, Josh van der Flier, Rhys Ruddock and the rest of Schmidt\u2019s swarming green army. With Billy Vunipola not having played a lot of rugby recently, it makes Jones\u2019s selection at No 6 all the more crucial. Does he redeploy Courtney Lawes or Maro Itoje or, with Chris Robshaw yet to make a competitive return following knee surgery, rely on the trusty Mark Wilson or Brad Shields?</p> <p>The answer is probably Wilson (if fit) unless Jones pulls an energiser bunny out of the hat and picks the uncapped Harlequin Alex Dombrandt to provide a bit of pace, bosh and unpredictability. Then again, is the Aviva Stadium on the opening weekend of the Six Nations the ideal place for such a bold selectorial flourish?

      "bodyText": "There can be no question about the best rugby story of 2019 so far. For Scotland to have the chance of both its professional teams reaching Europe\u2019s last eight going into the final round of Champions Cup pool matches is as unprecedented as it is great news for a tournament which thrives on diversity. Sure, the leading Irish, French and English candidates are still in the mix but a double-whammy of Edinburgh and Glasgow really would be a collector\u2019s item. It is not always an easy life as a pro rugby player in Scotland. There are bigger bucks available elsewhere and, until this season, their major teams have reached the European quarter-finals just twice and once respectively in 22 years of trying. When Gregor Townsend names his Six Nations squad this week it will be from a position of collective psychological strength unparalleled since Jim Telfer\u2019s heyday. Which, of course, begs a familiar question: does European form translate to the international stage? This time last year, when England were \u2013 as now \u2013 mostly underperforming in Europe, Eddie Jones was unimpressed by a headline in the Guardian \u2013 \u201cPremiership\u2019s faltering form in Europe could spell trouble for England\u201d \u2013 suggesting it might impact on their 2018 Six Nations prospects. \u201cIf they\u2019re not successful at club level, it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be successful at international level,\u201d said Jones. Fair enough, but England\u2019s fifth-placed finish in the Six Nations did not exactly explode the notion of a legitimate link between European form in January and Test form immediately afterwards. This does not automatically mean that Scotland are about to win a grand slam, even if three of their first four fixtures are being played at Murrayfield this year. When expectations have been ramped up on Scottish sides in the recent past, they have not always responded positively. And yet. If a Lions party were touring this summer, Hamish Watson, Darcy Graham, Blair Kinghorn, Stuart McInally, WP Nel, Jonny Gray, Stuart Hogg and Finn Russell would all be legitimate contenders. Sam Skinner was excellent again for Exeter on Sunday. Mix in a dash of Edinburgh\u2019s Richard Cockerill-engineered resilience and why would Scotland not be heading into the next couple of months feeling genuinely optimistic? Was it totally coincidental, too, that Ireland won a grand slam last season when their provinces were also riding high? This time around both Munster and Ulster have stepped up a gear from last season and Leinster, the defending European champions, are nicely placed to grab their customary home quarter-final draw. No one who saw Joey Carbery\u2019s masterclass at Kingsholm on Friday night will need telling that Joe Schmidt has rare strength-in-depth at his disposal. Which nicely sets the scene for Jones\u2019s Six Nations squad announcement on Thursday. Gone are the days of England coaches naming squads in the breezy knowledge they were pretty much certain to finish in the top half of the table. And where does Jones turn for upbeat, in-form players on a roll with their clubs? Aside from Saracens and Exeter none of the Premiership\u2019s other five European contenders are remotely in the hunt with one round still to play. What happens, furthermore, if the Chiefs go to Munster this weekend and get munched by the home back row just as Gloucester were last Friday night? It would further strengthen the suspicion that players accustomed to the Premiership, relentless and punishing though it may be, are being outflanked by some of the more dynamic breakdown operators who ply their domestic trade elsewhere. Which is effectively what Jones is acknowledging every time he pointedly omits yet another prominent Premiership back-rower from his plans. With the unfortunate Sam Underhill out injured that heaps an awful lot of pressure on Sale\u2019s Tom Curry. It is asking a lot to expect him to go to Dublin and single-handedly outplay Dan Leavy, Peter O\u2019Mahony (if fit), Se\u00e1n O\u2019Brien (ditto), CJ Stander, Josh van der Flier, Rhys Ruddock and the rest of Schmidt\u2019s swarming green army. With Billy Vunipola not having played a lot of rugby recently, it makes Jones\u2019s selection at No 6 all the more crucial. Does he redeploy Courtney Lawes or Maro Itoje or, with Chris Robshaw yet to make a competitive return following knee surgery, rely on the trusty Mark Wilson or Brad Shields? The answer is probably Wilson (if fit) unless Jones pulls an energiser bunny out of the hat and picks the uncapped Harlequin Alex Dombrandt to provide a bit of pace, bosh and unpredictability. Then again, is the Aviva Stadium on the opening weekend of the Six Nations the ideal place for such a bold selectorial flourish? It scarcely helps that England have barely a week\u2019s preparation together in Portugal before flying to Dublin, with forecasts for icy weather around the start of February already circulating. If Dombrandt makes Thursday\u2019s squad, it will surely be with more distant assignments in mind. Jones, though, no longer has the luxury of time to experiment. The squad he names on Thursday, give or take the injured Anthony Watson, will not be far removed from the one travelling to Japan this autumn. If Dan Robson, Dan Cole, Chris Ashton, Joe Cokanasiga, Joe Marchant, Danny Cipriani, Luke Cowan-Dickie and Ellis Genge do not make it now, their World Cup prospects really will be slim. Unless, of course, England\u2019s Euro-star opponents prove so irresistible it proves a good Six Nations to miss. Johnny be good At the annual Rugby Union Writers\u2019 Dinner in London on Monday night the prestigious Pat Marshall Trophy for personality of the year was presented to Ireland\u2019s Johnny Sexton.

Government whips had suggested MPs who hoped to spare May the humiliation of a three-figure defeat on her Brexit deal should vote for the amendment submitted by Benn \u2013 which would have rejected her deal and prevented a no-deal Brexit. Should the amendment have passed, it would have made it impossible for the vote on May\u2019s deal itself to go ahead. Under pressure from Labour to pull the amendment rather than give May an escape route, Benn confirmed on Twitter he had withdrawn the amendment. \u201cI have decided to withdraw my amendment to the government\u2019s withdrawal agreement motion today which would have rejected both the PM\u2019s deal and leaving with no deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s vital that we now get the clearest expression of view from the house on the government\u2019s deal \u2013 like many others I will vote against it \u2013 but I intend to pursue a \u2018no to no-deal\u2019 vote at the earliest opportunity.\u201d Benn said the amendment tabled by Yvette Cooper last week to the finance bill, which was backed by 20 Conservative MPs, had already proved there was a majority in the house against no deal.

Another amendment gathering support ahead of the vote on Tuesday night is one tabled by the Tory backbencher Andrew Murrison, which aims to put a \u201csunset clause\u201d on the backstop arrangements in the withdrawal agreement. Brexiters have been particularly angered by the backstop, an insurance arrangement to keep the UK in an effective customs union until a solution is found to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland, because it does not have a firm end date and cannot be exited unilaterally. Murrison, the chair of the Northern Ireland affairs committee, has tabled an amendment that would prevent the backstop arrangement extending beyond the end of 2022. The amendment has been signed by a number of senior Tory loyalists, including Sir Graham Brady, Damian Green and Robert Goodwill, suggesting it has some tacit whips\u2019 support. The amendment will not pass the Commons because it does not have Labour frontbench support, but No 10 is likely to watch to see how much support the ploy will attract. The EU has thus far refused to countenance putting any exit date in the backstop arrangement but the amendment could act as further proof that the deal will not pass parliament without one.

      "bodyText": "Two more European Union states, Poland and the Czech Republic, have said they are preparing emergency laws to allow Britons to stay to work in their countries legally in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The Czechs say their draft law will mean the estimated 8,000 Britons living in the country are exempt from normal immigration laws until the end of the December 2020. With a 21-month exemption period, it appears to be the most generous of proposals made so far by any member state for Britons settled in the bloc. However, it will only become effective if the UK reciprocates and guarantees the rights of about 40,000 Czech citizens living in Britain. The Polish government is drafting a similar law which will give the estimated 6,000 Britons in the country a year without having to change their status to immigrants from a third country. The proposed legislation will offer relief to Britons in Poland and the Czech Republic \u2013 although they only represent around 14,000 of the estimated 1 million Britons settled on the continent. The Polish have said they will offer permanent residency covering the right to work to those who have been in the country for more than five years and a three-year temporary residence permit to those who have been there for fewer than five years. The card will have the word Brexit on it, making it distinguishable from the normal residency permit. It will also protect the rights of non-EU spouses of Britons. The 25-page draft bill which appears on the website of the government legislation centre says that once the UK leaves at midnight on 29-30 March this year, Britons living in Poland will have until 30 March 2020 to confirm their rights by obtaining a temporary residence permit or permanent residence in the country. Applications registered later will not be considered. The draft laws come after the authorities in Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands sought to give last-minute assurances to anxious British nationals. Berlin authorities already opened an online registration for British nationals while the Italians have promised emergency legislation to exempt Britons from normal immigration laws if the UK crashes out of the EU. France has also sought to reassure the estimated 160,000 Britons of their post-Brexit status and the Dutch last week told Britons they could stay there in the event of a cliff-edge Brexit. The move by Poland comes just weeks after Theresa May told its prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, during a visit to Downing Street that the Polish people were welcome in the UK. She said: \u201cAlmost 1 million Poles make their lives in Britain That is why securing the rights of Polish and other EU citizens was my priority in the Brexit negotiations.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The streets of Xi\u2019an\u2019s Muslim quarter are bustling. Tourists from all over China and the rest of the world throng the small stalls and restaurants for delicacies such as yangrou paomo lamb stew, roujiamo lamb burgers, persimmon cakes and \u201csmoked ice-cream\u201d \u2013 a bowl of puffed cereal dipped in liquid nitrogen. There has been a Muslim community in the capital of Shaanxi Province \u2013 at the eastern end of the old Silk Road in central China \u2013 since the seventh century. During the Tang dynasty, when the city was called Chang\u2019an, travelling Muslim merchants and some soldiers from central and west Asia made it their home. Many married Chinese Han women, and their offspring became known as Hui, now one of China\u2019s 56 ethnic groups. The Muslim quarter is well-known for its range of halal and non-halal food stalls In 2019, as the population of the wider city nears the 10 million mark that would define it as a \u201cmegacity\u201d, the Muslim population is estimated at around 65,000. Most live and work in the Muslim quarter, in the centre of historical Xi\u2019an. Life is good here. Restaurants and stalls boast of being featured on China Central Television, the state broadcaster, in programmes such as A Bite of China. Many visitors come for the halal food, the most well-known example of which is yangrou paomo. Diners tear mo bread into pieces and then watch the chef churn it into the lamb soup. Roujiamo is another famous halal dish \u2013 a burger made from juicy shredded braised lamb and crispy baked bread. Then there are the wide, thick and incredibly filling biangbiang noodles \u2013 perfect for cold winter days. In the summer, liang pi is popular (cold rice noodles served in a sauce of chilli oil, pepper powder, vinegar and diced garlic, garnished with bean sprouts and sliced cucumber), as is pomegranate juice \u2013 sweet, sour and cool. The entrance to Xiyangshi Street in the Muslim quarter But non-Muslim snacks such as Hunan stinky tofu, Hubei roasted potatoes and barbecued squid and octopus are increasingly available too. More and more shops now sell typical souvenirs from Shaanxi \u2013 such as leather shadow-play puppets and replicas of Qin terracotta warriors and horses. There are also plenty of the kind of generic Chinese gifts that can be bought in any Chinese tourist town, most of them made in the manufacturing hub of Yiwu: Che Guevara T-shirts, cigarette containers featuring Mao Zedong, Buddhist prayer beads, you name it. Caricature street artists do a roaring trade as well. Shops and stalls sell everything from spices and stinky tofu to souvenirs for tourists Behind the story of booming business lurks an old fear \u2013 the precarious situation of being Muslim in China, especially given the reports of anti-terror crackdowns and political re-education camps in the majority-Muslim region of Xinjiang, more than 1,000 miles to the north-west. \u201cYou can\u2019t be too careful,\u201d says one Chinese Muslim Hui I meet through a former colleague, and who does not want to be named in the international media. \u201cYou know the situation in Xinjiang?

      "body": "<p>Congress is expected to make an unprecedented challenge to Donald Trump\u2019s authority to take the US into a war in the coming weeks, with a bipartisan measure calling for the end of US military involvement in the Yemen conflict.</p> <p>The Senate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/13/senate-yemen-saudis-trump-resolution\">passed the measure</a>, invoking the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/law/help/war-powers.php\">1973 War Powers Resolution</a>, last month but a parallel effort in the House of Representatives was sunk by the Republican leadership. Now the House is under Democratic control, there is a plan to put forward identical measures in both chambers, which would put a permanent end to US refuelling, logistical support, intelligence and special forces operations with the Saudi-led coalition.</p> <p>It would force Trump to accept the constraints on his executive power, or use his veto to continue an unpopular war, in support of an unpopular ally in Riyadh.</p> <p>It is unlikely his opponents could muster the two-thirds majorities in each house required to override the veto, but the standoff would highlight the deep divide between the president and Congress over Saudi relations, at a time when Yemen is on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/25/famine-in-yemen-could-become-one-of-worst-in-living-memory-un-says\">brink of famine</a>, and in the wake of the brutal murder of the Washington Post columnist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi\">Jamal Khashoggi</a> in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/25/famine-in-yemen-could-become-one-of-worst-in-living-memory-un-says\">Famine in Yemen could become one of worst in living memory, UN says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ro Khanna, the lead author of the proposed House resolution, said he had an undertaking from the new House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, that it would be put to a vote in the next six weeks, though that timing might be set back by the government shutdown.</p> <p>The resolution will be identical to a resolution passed by the Senate in December, by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/13/senate-yemen-saudis-trump-resolution\">56 to 41 majority</a>. Since there is a new Senate following November midterm elections, the measure \u2013 introduced by independent senator Bernie Sanders, Republican Mike Lee and Democrat Chris Murphy \u2013 would have to be reintroduced.</p> <p>But 51 senators who backed the resolution in December are still in their seats, as well as two new Democrats who are expected to back it.</p> <p>\u201cWe are waiting for the shutdown to end, but we are ready to move pretty quickly,\u201d a Democratic Senate staffer said.</p> <p>If the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/09/yemen-ceasefire-is-holding-but-10-million-face-famine-un-is-told\">ceasefire agreed last month</a> for Hodeidah and other Yemeni ports holds and humanitarian aid is allowed to flow freely to the 22 million Yemenis in desperate need, and if the Saudi regime shows more transparency over the Khashoggi murder, the legislation could be held back. But its backers say the threat of its passing was enough to force concessions from the Saudi-backed Yemeni government delegation at ceasefire talks in Sweden.</p> <p>If passed, it will be the first time Congress has used a war powers resolution measure to limit the president\u2019s power to take the country into a foreign conflict.</p> <p>\u201cOne cannot underestimate the historic impact of the House and Senate passing this,\u201d Khanna said in an interview with the Guardian. He said that the former defence secretary James Mattis advised the Saudis to make progress in the Stockholm talks to avoid \u201cfurther embarrassment from Congress\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from reports on the ground in Sweden that they\u2019re carefully watching what Congress does,\u201d he added. \u201cI believe that both chambers of Congress acting would be such a statement to the world and to the Saudis and the coalition ... that they themselves will temper the military offensive and it may lead to a ceasefire. It may lead to the opening of ports and allowing humanitarian assistance. They don\u2019t want to continue to jeopardize their relationship with the United States.\u201d</p> <p>Khanna believes the Trump administration overplayed its hand over the Saudi monarchy\u2019s role in Yemen and the Khashoggi murder. Mattis and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, repeatedly assured Congress the Saudi military was making efforts to limit civilian casualties from coalition bombing. However, there was no reduction in the toll and coalition actions to isolate areas of the country run by Houthi rebels has brought Yemen to the brink of what the UN warns could be the worst famine in a generation.</p> <p>Since the murder and dismemberment of Khashoggi by Saudi operatives, Trump, Pompeo and Mattis played down the culpability of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a close Trump ally, in spite of a CIA assessment that he almost certainly ordered the murder. Administration briefings and attempts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/27/jamal-khashoggi-murder-senate-briefing-saudi-arabia-gina-haspel-white-house\">to prevent the CIA director</a>, Gina Haspel, briefing Congress, angered members on both sides of the aisle.</p> <p>\u201cIt has made members of Congress more willing to assert their article 1 rights of having a role in foreign policy,\u201d Khanna said. The first article of the US constitution formally gives Congress the sole authority to declare war, but that has been largely ignored by a succession of presidents from both parties.

      "bodyText": "Congress is expected to make an unprecedented challenge to Donald Trump\u2019s authority to take the US into a war in the coming weeks, with a bipartisan measure calling for the end of US military involvement in the Yemen conflict. The Senate passed the measure, invoking the 1973 War Powers Resolution, last month but a parallel effort in the House of Representatives was sunk by the Republican leadership. Now the House is under Democratic control, there is a plan to put forward identical measures in both chambers, which would put a permanent end to US refuelling, logistical support, intelligence and special forces operations with the Saudi-led coalition. It would force Trump to accept the constraints on his executive power, or use his veto to continue an unpopular war, in support of an unpopular ally in Riyadh. It is unlikely his opponents could muster the two-thirds majorities in each house required to override the veto, but the standoff would highlight the deep divide between the president and Congress over Saudi relations, at a time when Yemen is on the brink of famine, and in the wake of the brutal murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Ro Khanna, the lead author of the proposed House resolution, said he had an undertaking from the new House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, that it would be put to a vote in the next six weeks, though that timing might be set back by the government shutdown. The resolution will be identical to a resolution passed by the Senate in December, by a 56 to 41 majority. Since there is a new Senate following November midterm elections, the measure \u2013 introduced by independent senator Bernie Sanders, Republican Mike Lee and Democrat Chris Murphy \u2013 would have to be reintroduced. But 51 senators who backed the resolution in December are still in their seats, as well as two new Democrats who are expected to back it. \u201cWe are waiting for the shutdown to end, but we are ready to move pretty quickly,\u201d a Democratic Senate staffer said. If the ceasefire agreed last month for Hodeidah and other Yemeni ports holds and humanitarian aid is allowed to flow freely to the 22 million Yemenis in desperate need, and if the Saudi regime shows more transparency over the Khashoggi murder, the legislation could be held back. But its backers say the threat of its passing was enough to force concessions from the Saudi-backed Yemeni government delegation at ceasefire talks in Sweden. If passed, it will be the first time Congress has used a war powers resolution measure to limit the president\u2019s power to take the country into a foreign conflict. \u201cOne cannot underestimate the historic impact of the House and Senate passing this,\u201d Khanna said in an interview with the Guardian. He said that the former defence secretary James Mattis advised the Saudis to make progress in the Stockholm talks to avoid \u201cfurther embarrassment from Congress\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from reports on the ground in Sweden that they\u2019re carefully watching what Congress does,\u201d he added. \u201cI believe that both chambers of Congress acting would be such a statement to the world and to the Saudis and the coalition ... that they themselves will temper the military offensive and it may lead to a ceasefire. It may lead to the opening of ports and allowing humanitarian assistance. They don\u2019t want to continue to jeopardize their relationship with the United States.\u201d Khanna believes the Trump administration overplayed its hand over the Saudi monarchy\u2019s role in Yemen and the Khashoggi murder. Mattis and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, repeatedly assured Congress the Saudi military was making efforts to limit civilian casualties from coalition bombing. However, there was no reduction in the toll and coalition actions to isolate areas of the country run by Houthi rebels has brought Yemen to the brink of what the UN warns could be the worst famine in a generation. Since the murder and dismemberment of Khashoggi by Saudi operatives, Trump, Pompeo and Mattis played down the culpability of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a close Trump ally, in spite of a CIA assessment that he almost certainly ordered the murder. Administration briefings and attempts to prevent the CIA director, Gina Haspel, briefing Congress, angered members on both sides of the aisle. \u201cIt has made members of Congress more willing to assert their article 1 rights of having a role in foreign policy,\u201d Khanna said. The first article of the US constitution formally gives Congress the sole authority to declare war, but that has been largely ignored by a succession of presidents from both parties. Khanna argues that the Trump administration will force the legislature to take its duties more seriously. \u201cThe overreach by the administration and the disregard for Congress has awakened Congress from our slumber,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Some modern universities could lose about a third of their students and face a struggle to survive if plans go ahead to stop young people with lower grades qualifying for loans, data obtained by Education Guardian suggests. The prime minister\u2019s review of post-18 education, due to report next month, is expected to recommend a cut to tuition fees. But another idea that has been leaked is to limit numbers by stopping young students qualifying for a loan if they get fewer than three Ds at A-level. The proposal has sparked anger in universities because it is likely to hit would-be students from the poorest families much harder than their middle-class counterparts. New data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) also shows 16 modern universities in England could lose between 15 and 36% of their full-time degree students overnight, based on 2016-17 figures. Many others would also see a substantial drop. Experts say the loss of income could push struggling universities to the brink, especially on top of a cut in fees. Simon Marginson, professor of higher education at Oxford University, says: \u201cA huge cut in income like this would inevitably mean that institutions would flounder, and some would be surviving on a week-to-week basis. That is bad for the sector, bad for students, bad for graduates and bad for employers. It would throw everyone into chaos.\u201d London Metropolitan University, whose student numbers fell by a third in the five years to 2017, according to the admissions service Ucas, would be worst hit. The data shows that 36% of its full-time degree students were admitted with fewer than three Ds at A-level or equivalent in 2016-17. It was closely followed by Bolton University, at 31%, and the University of Bedfordshire, 27%. The PM\u2019s review, led by the former equities broker Philip Augar, is, according to another leak, considering a cut in fees from \u00a39,250 to \u00a36,500, for arts, humanities and social science subjects. Science, technology and engineering degrees, which typically lead to better paid jobs, could cost up to \u00a313,500. Universities are not hopeful that the government will step in with extra funding to plug the gap, meaning they would lose nearly \u00a33,000 a head for many courses. All universities are viewing this as a massive blow. But experts say it could sound the death knell for less popular institutions that are already struggling in the fierce new higher education market. Matt Robb, managing partner at the strategy consultancy EY-Parthenon, which advises universities, says: \u201cIf they cut fees to \u00a36,500, some universities will bleed to death.\u201d He argues that the government\u2019s new Office for Students can no longer refuse to bail out failing institutions if fees are cut without new public funding to compensate. \u201cIf you slash university funding by a third you can\u2019t just wash your hands of it all and say let the market solve the problem.\u201d Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, says some institutions have already had to take out bridging loans to pay staff wages while they wait for their first tranche of this academic year\u2019s fees from the Student Loans Company. \u201cIf you push them over a cliff, what looks like a moderately popular policy of cutting fees suddenly becomes a major political scandal.

This means that if their employer is exploitative or abusive, their main means of escape \u2013 moving to another employer \u2013 is closed to them.</p> <p>Mel, a 36-year-old domestic worker from the Philippines, describes being brought to London in 2009 by a Saudi family. Her contract guaranteed her a \u00a31,500-a-month salary; in fact, she was paid nothing. She worked most days from 6am until at least 1am and slept in the laundry room. After four years, she managed to escape with the help of a Filipino friend who was a member of the <a href=\"https://www.thevoiceofdomesticworkers.com/our-mission\" title=\"\">Voice of Domestic Workers</a> (VODW), a grassroots self-help group. Since then she has been undocumented, working as a volunteer for VODW, which supports her.</p> <p>\u201cWhy should escaping from an abusive employer be a crime?\u201d she asks, but five years after she fled her host family, the law caught up with her. At 7.45am on a cold morning in December, Mel heard a loud knock on her front door. She opened it to find four immigration officers. They arrested her and spirited her away in a white van to Becket House, <a href=\"http://london.noborders.org.uk/node/359\" title=\"\">an immigration reporting centre</a> near Tower Bridge in London, where she was photographed, fingerprinted and invited to return voluntarily to the Philippines. Just going back home is not an option for Mel and the women like her: her earnings would be so meagre that there is no way that she could support her children.</p> <p>The contract that Grace, 45, also from the Philippines, signed with the Kuwaiti family who brought her to the UK was for \u00a31,200 a month, she recalls. She was paid just \u00a3220. Like her fellow domestic workers, she sent most of her earnings back home. Grace went abroad to lift her four children out of poverty \u2013 \u201cto give food to your kids, pay for school uniform, books, transport \u2013 and hospital\u201d. She worked seven days a week \u2013 no days off or holidays. What if she got sick? \u201cYou needed to get up!\u201d she says. Grace wasn\u2019t allowed out unaccompanied; when, two months after she arrived, her employers went to France on holiday, they locked her in the house alone for a week. A cleaner from a neighbouring house, hearing her sobbing, put a ladder up against the back balcony, enabling her to escape with her possessions in a black sack. Grace is now undocumented and dependent on \u201cgood Filipinos giving me odd jobs\u201d to get by.</p> <p>Lucy, 46, weeps as she talks of her three children, aged 27, 18 and 13, whom she hasn\u2019t seen for seven years, as a consequence \u2013 she says \u2013 of her employer pretending to renew her visa, but never doing so. Her husband back in the Philippines, who had diabetes, urged her to come home but, as she was taking her case to the high court, \u201cI said let\u2019s wait \u2013 and then he died. We\u2019d been married for 23 years.\u201d Lucy\u2019s appeal failed. \u201cI went crazy, I was thinking of suicide. Now I\u2019m OK, but it\u2019s so sad.\u201d Lucy is now working \u201cunderground\u201d, for an employer who is aware of her situation but pays her a living wage.</p> <p>Before 2012, an MDW could renew their visa over a period of five years and then apply for indefinite leave to remain and ultimately British citizenship. This was the route taken by Marissa Begonia, a VODW founding member and coordinator.</p> <p>After lobbying by VODW, the trade union Unite and <a href=\"http://www.kalayaan.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Kalayaan</a>, a charity for domestic workers, the government commissioned an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas-domestic-workers-visa-independent-review\" title=\"\">independent review</a> of the UK\u2019s domestic visa policies in 2015. Attaching the visa to a specific employer, the review found, increased these women\u2019s vulnerability to exploitation, while living outside the law \u201cincreases their vulnerability to further abuse\u201d. The report\u2019s author, James Ewins, recommended an unconditional right for migrant domestic workers to change their employer and the right to apply for an annual extension of their visa for a maximum of two-and-a-half years.</p> <p>The government rejected this recommendation. All it did, in 2016, as part of the Modern Slavery Act, was slightly modify the harsh restrictions it had introduced in 2012. A MDW now could change employer, but only within the six-month original visa period, which could not then be extended. In reality, most workers have to leave \u2013 or go underground.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b7bd74b803d4dbb53714488f2b4d61ec889cc644\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7bd74b803d4dbb53714488f2b4d61ec889cc644/0_0_2000_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marissa Begonia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marissa Begonia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lauren Maccabee/My Home Is Not My Home</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2011, the UN International Labour Organization introduced the <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:2551460\" title=\"\">Domestic Workers Convention</a> to improve the living and working rights of domestic workers. It has been ratified by 26 countries \u2013 including Ireland, Germany and Italy \u2013 but the UK is not among them. Meanwhile, migrant domestic workers in the UK remain mostly unprotected by laws that the rest of us take for granted \u2013 they are not covered by health and safety laws, for example, or the Working Time Regulations 1998, and employers often don\u2019t comply with the national minimum wage \u2013 as Mel and Grace know only too well.</p> <p>When VODW polled its members, it found that, of the 500 who responded, 76% had experienced verbal or physical abuse, and that they worked on average 91 hours a week. Some had even had their passports confiscated by their employers. Because of the hidden, private nature of the work and because many are unable to speak English, these women are socially isolated. There are few examples of true modern slavery, but these are undoubtedly some of them.</p> <p>\u201cTheir status as workers is blurred by the language \u2013 like \u2018maids\u2019 or \u2018domestic servants\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s used to describe them,\u201d says Joyce Jiang, a lecturer at the University of York and researcher into the experiences of immigrant workers. Many of these women have had to leave their own children to look after those of their employers \u2013 and because of the intimate nature of the work, they are often seen as \u201clabourers of love\u201d or \u201cpart of the family\u201d, which obscures how little they are paid.</p> <p>I asked the Home Office whether it planned to change the rules regarding MDWs, to allow these women, many of whom have lived and worked here for years, the right to stay legally. It pointed me to the <a href=\"http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/about-us/what-we-do/specialist-capabilities/uk-human-trafficking-centre/national-referral-mechanism\" title=\"\">National Referral Mechanism (NRM)</a>, a framework for identifying and supporting victims of human trafficking that, since 2016, also encompasses slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour. The MDWs who go down this route successfully can get a two-year visa, after which they must return home. But it\u2019s an imperfect solution, says Begonia. \u201cYou need to have been raped, beaten or starved to death to get it. If you\u2019re not paid for months, is that not abuse or servitude?\u201d</p> <p>Those in abusive workplaces who don\u2019t apply fall back on the services of VODW. Begonia, Grace and the others constitute a remarkable rescue service. They distribute cards written in Tagalog, Hindi and Indonesian offering help and a phone number. When called, they go to a MDW\u2019s home, wait outside and then escort them to safety. \u201cSometimes they don\u2019t even know the address, so we tell them to look for an envelope that has it. Or if they\u2019re working in a hotel, we tell them to phone reception,\u201d says Begonia. VODW has rescued 80 women in this way.</p> <p>Now, in collaboration with Jiang and the film-maker Tassia Kobylinska of Goldsmiths, University of London, VODW has produced a video and exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/tassia-kobylinska-and-the-voice-of-domestic-workers-my-home-is-not-my-home/\" title=\"\">My Home Is Not My Home</a>. As part of the project, funded by the University of York, Kobylinska worked with a group of migrant domestic workers, teaching them how to frame images and record audio so that they could document their lives on their phones. The exhibition includes an MDW\u2019s white uniform, a job contract, the clothes that one MDW wore when escaping and letters from their children. \u201cTo put these things in a gallery makes them valuable. We hope that this will bring into the public domain what has festered behind closed doors. It can be used in evidence as part of their campaign [to remain here],\u201d says Kobylinska.</p> <p>Begonia herself trod this path. \u201cIt was the most difficult and painful decision of my life to leave my children behind when they were one, two and three. I wanted so much to be a normal mother who could look after them physically \u2013 but my sister was their mother, really, and not me \u2026 what kept me going was the dream that we could one day be together again.\u201d For her, the story has a happy ending. She has become a formidable voice for MDWs \u2013 lobbying parliament, speaking at the UN on behalf of VODW, for which she works part-time (she is still a domestic worker the rest of the time). Her three children now live with her and work in the UK.</p> <p>Of the others, Mel has been referred to the NRM. Lucy and Grace, however, remain undocumented. For them, in every sense, the UK is far from home.</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed.

A cleaner from a neighbouring house, hearing her sobbing, put a ladder up against the back balcony, enabling her to escape with her possessions in a black sack. Grace is now undocumented and dependent on \u201cgood Filipinos giving me odd jobs\u201d to get by. Lucy, 46, weeps as she talks of her three children, aged 27, 18 and 13, whom she hasn\u2019t seen for seven years, as a consequence \u2013 she says \u2013 of her employer pretending to renew her visa, but never doing so. Her husband back in the Philippines, who had diabetes, urged her to come home but, as she was taking her case to the high court, \u201cI said let\u2019s wait \u2013 and then he died. We\u2019d been married for 23 years.\u201d Lucy\u2019s appeal failed. \u201cI went crazy, I was thinking of suicide. Now I\u2019m OK, but it\u2019s so sad.\u201d Lucy is now working \u201cunderground\u201d, for an employer who is aware of her situation but pays her a living wage. Before 2012, an MDW could renew their visa over a period of five years and then apply for indefinite leave to remain and ultimately British citizenship. This was the route taken by Marissa Begonia, a VODW founding member and coordinator. After lobbying by VODW, the trade union Unite and Kalayaan, a charity for domestic workers, the government commissioned an independent review of the UK\u2019s domestic visa policies in 2015. Attaching the visa to a specific employer, the review found, increased these women\u2019s vulnerability to exploitation, while living outside the law \u201cincreases their vulnerability to further abuse\u201d. The report\u2019s author, James Ewins, recommended an unconditional right for migrant domestic workers to change their employer and the right to apply for an annual extension of their visa for a maximum of two-and-a-half years. The government rejected this recommendation. All it did, in 2016, as part of the Modern Slavery Act, was slightly modify the harsh restrictions it had introduced in 2012. A MDW now could change employer, but only within the six-month original visa period, which could not then be extended. In reality, most workers have to leave \u2013 or go underground. In 2011, the UN International Labour Organization introduced the Domestic Workers Convention to improve the living and working rights of domestic workers. It has been ratified by 26 countries \u2013 including Ireland, Germany and Italy \u2013 but the UK is not among them. Meanwhile, migrant domestic workers in the UK remain mostly unprotected by laws that the rest of us take for granted \u2013 they are not covered by health and safety laws, for example, or the Working Time Regulations 1998, and employers often don\u2019t comply with the national minimum wage \u2013 as Mel and Grace know only too well. When VODW polled its members, it found that, of the 500 who responded, 76% had experienced verbal or physical abuse, and that they worked on average 91 hours a week. Some had even had their passports confiscated by their employers. Because of the hidden, private nature of the work and because many are unable to speak English, these women are socially isolated. There are few examples of true modern slavery, but these are undoubtedly some of them. \u201cTheir status as workers is blurred by the language \u2013 like \u2018maids\u2019 or \u2018domestic servants\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s used to describe them,\u201d says Joyce Jiang, a lecturer at the University of York and researcher into the experiences of immigrant workers. Many of these women have had to leave their own children to look after those of their employers \u2013 and because of the intimate nature of the work, they are often seen as \u201clabourers of love\u201d or \u201cpart of the family\u201d, which obscures how little they are paid. I asked the Home Office whether it planned to change the rules regarding MDWs, to allow these women, many of whom have lived and worked here for years, the right to stay legally. It pointed me to the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), a framework for identifying and supporting victims of human trafficking that, since 2016, also encompasses slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour. The MDWs who go down this route successfully can get a two-year visa, after which they must return home. But it\u2019s an imperfect solution, says Begonia. \u201cYou need to have been raped, beaten or starved to death to get it. If you\u2019re not paid for months, is that not abuse or servitude?\u201d Those in abusive workplaces who don\u2019t apply fall back on the services of VODW. Begonia, Grace and the others constitute a remarkable rescue service. They distribute cards written in Tagalog, Hindi and Indonesian offering help and a phone number. When called, they go to a MDW\u2019s home, wait outside and then escort them to safety. \u201cSometimes they don\u2019t even know the address, so we tell them to look for an envelope that has it. Or if they\u2019re working in a hotel, we tell them to phone reception,\u201d says Begonia. VODW has rescued 80 women in this way. Now, in collaboration with Jiang and the film-maker Tassia Kobylinska of Goldsmiths, University of London, VODW has produced a video and exhibition, My Home Is Not My Home. As part of the project, funded by the University of York, Kobylinska worked with a group of migrant domestic workers, teaching them how to frame images and record audio so that they could document their lives on their phones. The exhibition includes an MDW\u2019s white uniform, a job contract, the clothes that one MDW wore when escaping and letters from their children. \u201cTo put these things in a gallery makes them valuable. We hope that this will bring into the public domain what has festered behind closed doors. It can be used in evidence as part of their campaign [to remain here],\u201d says Kobylinska. Begonia herself trod this path. \u201cIt was the most difficult and painful decision of my life to leave my children behind when they were one, two and three. I wanted so much to be a normal mother who could look after them physically \u2013 but my sister was their mother, really, and not me \u2026 what kept me going was the dream that we could one day be together again.\u201d For her, the story has a happy ending. She has become a formidable voice for MDWs \u2013 lobbying parliament, speaking at the UN on behalf of VODW, for which she works part-time (she is still a domestic worker the rest of the time). Her three children now live with her and work in the UK. Of the others, Mel has been referred to the NRM. Lucy and Grace, however, remain undocumented. For them, in every sense, the UK is far from home. Some names have been changed. My Home Is Not My Home runs from 16 to 26 January at L\u2019Etrang\u00e8re, 44a Charlotte Road, London EC2",

If you value our Brexit coverage, please become a Guardian supporter. Thank you. Top stories Extraordinary, historic, momentous, unprecedented: you choose. Any or all could apply to this moment in British politics \u2013 all thanks to Brexit. A day before the crucial but apparently doomed vote on her deal, Theresa May launched a last-ditch bid to persuade MPs to back it, saying in a speech in Stoke-on-Trent that voting down her plan would destroy faith in politics and could \u201crisk there being no Brexit\u201d. She also refused to rule out extending article 50. The prime minister, speaking later in the Commons, added: Give this deal a second look. No it is not perfect. And yes it is a compromise. But when the history books are written, people will look at the decision of this house tomorrow and ask: did we deliver on the country\u2019s vote to leave the EU? Did we safeguard our economy, our security and our union? Or did we let the British people down? The EU\u2019s most senior officials, Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, rebuffed her demand for a 12-month limit to the Irish backstop but did say a technological solution for avoiding a hard border \u2013 as touted by Brexiters \u2013 could be possible, and that the bare bones custom union in the backstop need not be the basis of a future deal. EU sources said the bloc was preparing to delay Brexit until at least July on the assumption MPs would reject May\u2019s deal; the 29 March deadline is now seen as unlikely and a special summit could be convened to prolong the negotiating period by extending article 50 at the UK\u2019s request. May\u2019s room for manoeuvre shrank further after the government lost on an amendment tabled by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve (and controversially accepted by the Speaker, John Bercow), meaning she must now set out her plan B within three working days of a defeat. The ensuing debate will last just 90 minutes. Meanwhile the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, promised to table a no-confidence motion in the prime minister \u201csoon\u201d, possibly as early as Tuesday evening if she loses the Commons vote, and confirmed if the party won a snap election its priority would be to negotiate a new deal rather than hold a second referendum. And the positive Brexit news kept on rolling in: the Japanese prime minister said the \u201cwhole world\u201d wanted the UK to avoid a no deal; Jaguar Land Rover and Ford announced thousands of job losses; Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer began stockpiling tinned food; and farmers warned that no deal would be a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d.

      "body": "<p>China\u2019s sentencing of a Canadian to death for drug trafficking threatens to escalate tensions between the two countries and set a dangerous precedent, according to experts.</p> <p>On Monday, the Dalian Intermediate People\u2019s Court in the northeastern province of Liaoning increased Robert Schellenberg\u2019s sentence from 15 years in prison to the death penalty, concluding the Canadian had played \u201ca key role\u201d in a failed attempt to smuggle 222kg (almost 500lbs) of methamphetamine from China to Australia in 2014.</p> <p>The verdict has raised questions about whether Beijing is using the case to exert pressure on Ottawa after Canadian authorities detained<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/09/china-summons-us-ambassador-over-huawei-cfos-arrest\"> senior Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, in December.</a><br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/07/huawei-chinese-media-accuses-us-of-hooliganism-over-meng-wanzhou-arrest\">Huawei: Chinese media accuses US of 'hooliganism' over Meng Wanzhou arrest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re at a juncture where the case could proceed quite expeditiously if Beijing so chooses,\u201d said Maggie Lewis, a professor of law and expert in Chinese law at Seton Hall University in New Jersey.</p> <p>According to Lewis there are several points where Chinese authorities can stop or slow the process, or speed it up.</p> <p>\u201cIf Beijing wants to put the screws on, it could keep this case going forward in a rapid fire manner as we\u2019ve seen since the December appeal, or the government could press the pause button, or just slow down the pace.\u201d</p> <p>Schellenberg has 10 days to appeal the death penalty. If he doesn\u2019t, or if the appeal is rejected, then the court\u2019s verdict would go to the Supreme People\u2019s Court in Beijing. If they approve it, the execution could happen within seven days, but the court could also reduce the sentence.</p> <p>Two other Canadians, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, are also being held in China on unspecified allegations related to national security.<br></p> <p>Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau has accused Beijing of arbitrarily applying the death penalty in Schellenberg\u2019s case. The country\u2019s foreign ministry<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/14/china-sentences-canadian-man-death-drug-charges-robert-lloyd-schellenberg\"> issued a travel warning to Canadian citizens.</a></p> <p>On Tuesday, the state-run Global Times criticised Trudeau\u2019s remarks, pointing out that drug trafficking is a felony in China. \u201cWestern centrism has been very obvious in recent disputes between China and Canada. Whatever Canada does, it is the rule of law, but whatever China does is not,\u201d the English-language editorial on Tuesday said. \u201cThis unreasonable speculation is a rude contempt toward Chinese law.\u201d</p> <p>Experts say it is the timing and pace of Schellenberg\u2019s case more than the application of the death penalty that raises questions. The Global Times editorial noted that China has executed \u201cmany foreign nationals\u201d over drug smuggling. At least 19 foreign nationals were convicted of drug smuggling between 2009 and 2015, the human rights group Dui Hua Foundation told the New York Times.</p> <p>Schellenberg, who has been detained since 2014, originally received a sentence of 15 years in a ruling in November last year. In December, a higher court ordered a retrial as prosecutors claimed they had emerging evidence pointing to Schellenberg\u2019s role as a more central player, giving the defence little more than two weeks to prepare. The retrial lasted one day before a verdict and sentence were handed down.</p> <p>\u201cI find it extremely odd that the authorities could sit on a case for almost three years, and then within two weeks find \u2018new\u2019 evidence to suddenly sentence a man to death,\u201d said William Nee, China researcher for Amnesty International.</p> <p>Retrials, especially those in which a heavier sentence is given, are extremely rare.

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s sentencing of a Canadian to death for drug trafficking threatens to escalate tensions between the two countries and set a dangerous precedent, according to experts. On Monday, the Dalian Intermediate People\u2019s Court in the northeastern province of Liaoning increased Robert Schellenberg\u2019s sentence from 15 years in prison to the death penalty, concluding the Canadian had played \u201ca key role\u201d in a failed attempt to smuggle 222kg (almost 500lbs) of methamphetamine from China to Australia in 2014. The verdict has raised questions about whether Beijing is using the case to exert pressure on Ottawa after Canadian authorities detained senior Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, in December. \u201cWe\u2019re at a juncture where the case could proceed quite expeditiously if Beijing so chooses,\u201d said Maggie Lewis, a professor of law and expert in Chinese law at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. According to Lewis there are several points where Chinese authorities can stop or slow the process, or speed it up. \u201cIf Beijing wants to put the screws on, it could keep this case going forward in a rapid fire manner as we\u2019ve seen since the December appeal, or the government could press the pause button, or just slow down the pace.\u201d Schellenberg has 10 days to appeal the death penalty. If he doesn\u2019t, or if the appeal is rejected, then the court\u2019s verdict would go to the Supreme People\u2019s Court in Beijing. If they approve it, the execution could happen within seven days, but the court could also reduce the sentence. Two other Canadians, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, are also being held in China on unspecified allegations related to national security. Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau has accused Beijing of arbitrarily applying the death penalty in Schellenberg\u2019s case. The country\u2019s foreign ministry issued a travel warning to Canadian citizens. On Tuesday, the state-run Global Times criticised Trudeau\u2019s remarks, pointing out that drug trafficking is a felony in China. \u201cWestern centrism has been very obvious in recent disputes between China and Canada. Whatever Canada does, it is the rule of law, but whatever China does is not,\u201d the English-language editorial on Tuesday said. \u201cThis unreasonable speculation is a rude contempt toward Chinese law.\u201d Experts say it is the timing and pace of Schellenberg\u2019s case more than the application of the death penalty that raises questions. The Global Times editorial noted that China has executed \u201cmany foreign nationals\u201d over drug smuggling. At least 19 foreign nationals were convicted of drug smuggling between 2009 and 2015, the human rights group Dui Hua Foundation told the New York Times. Schellenberg, who has been detained since 2014, originally received a sentence of 15 years in a ruling in November last year. In December, a higher court ordered a retrial as prosecutors claimed they had emerging evidence pointing to Schellenberg\u2019s role as a more central player, giving the defence little more than two weeks to prepare. The retrial lasted one day before a verdict and sentence were handed down. \u201cI find it extremely odd that the authorities could sit on a case for almost three years, and then within two weeks find \u2018new\u2019 evidence to suddenly sentence a man to death,\u201d said William Nee, China researcher for Amnesty International. Retrials, especially those in which a heavier sentence is given, are extremely rare. Donald Clarke, a professor of law at the George Washington University Law School, found that re-trials were ordered in at most 2% of criminal appeals in China in 2017. \u201cRetrials are generally imposed for a lighter sentence. It\u2019 really really unusual to send back for retrial in order to impose a heavier sentence. The unusual happened here,\u201d he said. Critics worry retaliatory measures may become more common. \u201cThe case appears to reinforce the message \u2026 China views the holding of human hostages as an acceptable way to conduct diplomacy,\u201d Clarke wrote before the retrial on Monday. In 2014, after Canadian authorities arrested a Chinese businessman for extradition to the US over hacking claims, Chinese police arrested a Canadian couple who had been running a cafe since the 1980s on spy charges. Following Huawei exectuive, Meng Wanzhou\u2019s arrest in December, at least 13 Canadians have been detained in China, with most of them deported. \u201cWhat this means for the Chinese government\u2019s tactics going forward in large part depends on how this plays out,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIf this approach yields results that are favourable to Beijing, then it makes sense the government would consider using similar tactics in the future,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are in uncharted territory.\u201d",

Thousands have been gathering in cities across the country in protest at what some say is a pervasion of hate speech into national discourse. In Gda\u0144sk the European council president, Donald Tusk, addressed thousands assembled in honour of his longtime friend and political ally. \u201cMy dear Pawe\u0142, we are here with you today as your friends. You had to wait so long, until such a tragic moment, to see from up there just how many friends you have here in Gdansk.\u201d The alleged assassin, a 27-year-old convicted violent criminal, told the crowd after the stabbing that he blamed Adamowicz\u2019s former party Civic Platform for his jailing in 2014. Adamowicz was a hate figure in far-right circles for defending migrants, refugees and LGBT rights but no evidence has emerged of a political link to his murder.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Breast cancer \u2018tool\u2019 unveiled \u2013 </strong>Women may soon be able to find out their risk of getting breast cancer with the help of a GP and an online calculator.

The opposition ranged against the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal appears insurmountable as she prepares for the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d in the House of Commons this evening. Guardian analysis points to a majority of more than 200 MPs against the prime minister. Governments have been defeated by a margin of more than 100 votes only three times in the last century, according to records. On Monday, May issued one final plea to parliament, urging MPs to \u201ctake a second look\u201d at her deal and stressing that it was the only option on the table that could deliver an \u201corderly\u201d exit from the EU. But there has been little sign of movement, with backbenchers hoping to seize the agenda in parliament and force the government to seek a softer Brexit. What are the likely outcomes? Our analysis leans towards May losing the vote and article 50 being extended, delaying Brexit beyond 29 March so that something can be worked out. On Monday, May declined to categorically rule out an extension. Jeremy Corbyn rallied a packed meeting of the parliamentary Labour party \u2013 only four Labour MPs have declared publicly that they could vote for May\u2019s deal \u2013 as he prepares to call a no-confidence vote in his continuing pursuit of a general election. Questions are meanwhile being asked about Facebook allowing an obscure pro-Brexit group, funded by unknown sources, to buy \u00a388,000 in ads despite promises of transparency. Britain\u2019s Future has spent more than \u00a330,000 just in the last seven days pushing users to write to their MPs in support of Brexit.

      "bodyText": "Port Augusta in South Australia has reached 48.9C on Tuesday, as a heatwave sets in across much of Australia threatening more record hot days. All-time highest minimum temperatures have also been broken in three places. Meekatharra in Western Australia and Fowlers Gap and White Cliffs in New South Wales all registered an overnight minimum of 33C on Monday. Severe to extreme heatwave conditions extending from the interior of WA across South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, the ACT and NSW will bring maximum temperatures of 8C to 12C above average, and in some places up to 16C above average before the end of the week. From Tuesday through to Friday, parts of South Australia, Victoria and NSW may break January heat records, with daytime maximums extending up to the mid-40s. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a significant heatwave because we are expecting a number of records to fall across those areas for both minimum and maximum temperatures,\u201d said Dean Sgarbossa, a senior meteorologist with the Bureau of Meteorology. On Tuesday, Port Augusta in South Australia reached 48.9C, an all-time high since records began in 1962. Port Augusta Hay in NSW had reached a high of 47.2C by Tuesday afternoon and several locations in Victoria reached temperatures in the mid-40s, with Walpeup in the state\u2019s north-west recording 45.6C. South Australia is forecast to have three days of severe to extreme heat. The South Australian housing authority has issued a \u201ccode red\u201d until 16 January for greater metropolitan Adelaide. A code red means homelessness agencies will increase their services during the hot weather, including extending their operating hours. The Telecross REDi service, a Red Cross service that supports vulnerable people by calling them daily during heatwaves, has also been activated until Thursday. About 750 South Australians are on the list to receive calls during that time. In Adelaide, where the heat is affecting cycling\u2019s Tour Down Under, temperatures reached 41C on Tuesday and are forecast to hit 40C on Wednesday. In Victoria, severe to extreme heatwave conditions were forecast through to Friday and several locations across the state\u2019s north were expected to reach or exceed maximum January temperature records. Rutherglen, Yarrawonga, Echuca, Shepparton and Mildura were all expected to reach 46C on Tuesday and Mildura\u2019s temperature was 45.8C by the afternoon. Since midnight on Monday there were 20 active scrub, grass and bushfires in the state and authorities again had to issue warnings about the \u201cdisturbing trend\u201d of people breaking total fire bans and lighting camp fires. On Tuesday afternoon, seven aircraft and more than 20 trucks were at an out of control grass and scrub fire at Benloch, north east of Macedon that was threatening property. The nearest property was about 500m from the fire front and Emergency Management Victoria issued an emergency warning for residents to shelter in their homes. \u201cFor those people and people in that area, I want to reassure you that we\u2019re doing everything possible in relation to the fire,\u201d the state\u2019s emergency management commissioner Andrew Crisp said. In Melbourne, where the Australian Open is under way, coastal breezes are keeping the heat to the low and mid-30s, after reaching 37C on Monday. However, the city\u2019s outer suburbs will see temperatures into the 40s over the next couple of days. The ACT is expecting three days in a row of maximum temperatures above 40C from Wednesday, and NSW will bear the brunt of the heatwave later in the week when a large area of extreme heat conditions hits densely populated areas. \u201cThe entirety of the state of NSW will experience severe heatwave conditions for the majority of this week,\u201d Sgarbossa said. Several areas across western NSW are expecting temperatures above 45C from Tuesday and all the way through to the weekend. The Bom said that while the heat in coastal areas in the east of the state was tempered by sea breezes, high humidity would make the days ahead feel hotter than the temperature suggested. Sydney was forecast to reach 30C on Tuesday, 32C on Wednesday and 34C by Friday, before a cool change. But some western suburbs would exceed 40C for much of the week. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to be unique about NSW is overnight temperatures will be unusually warm across large areas of inland NSW, with some locations in the far west staying above 30C,\u201d Sgarbossa said. Much of the country had elevated fire danger ratings on Tuesday and that is expected to continue through the week. The Bom is forecasting a cooler change to start moving across through much of the heatwave-affected area from Friday.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe knew that something was amiss in the first couple days,\u201d said Brad Lister. \u201cWe were driving into the forest and at the same time both Andres and I said: \u2018Where are all the birds?\u2019 There was nothing.\u201d His return to the Luquillo rainforest in Puerto Rico after 35 years was to reveal an appalling discovery. The insect population that once provided plentiful food for birds throughout the mountainous national park had collapsed. On the ground, 98% had gone. Up in the leafy canopy, 80% had vanished. The most likely culprit by far is global warming. \u201cIt was just astonishing,\u201d Lister said. \u201cBefore, both the sticky ground plates and canopy plates would be covered with insects. You\u2019d be there for hours picking them off the plates at night. But now the plates would come down after 12 hours in the tropical forest with a couple of lonely insects trapped or none at all.\u201d \u201cIt was a true collapse of the insect populations in that rainforest,\u201d he said. \u201cWe began to realise this is terrible \u2013 a very, very disturbing result.\u201d Earth\u2019s bugs outweigh humans 17 times over and are such a fundamental foundation of the food chain that scientists say a crash in insect numbers risks \u201cecological Armageddon\u201d. When Lister\u2019s study was published in October, one expert called the findings \u201chyper-alarming\u201d. The Puerto Rico work is one of just a handful of studies assessing this vital issue, but those that do exist are deeply worrying. Flying insect numbers in Germany\u2019s natural reserves have plunged 75% in just 25 years. The virtual disappearance of birds in an Australian eucalyptus forest was blamed on a lack of insects caused by drought and heat. Lister and his colleague Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda also found that insect numbers in a dry forest in Mexico had fallen 80% since the 1980s. \u201cWe are essentially destroying the very life support systems that allow us to sustain our existence on the planet, along with all the other life on the planet,\u201d Lister said. \u201cIt is just horrifying to watch us decimate the natural world like this.\u201d It was not insects that drew Lister to the Luquillo rainforest for the first time in the mid-1970s. \u201cI was interested in competition among the anoles lizards,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re the most diverse group of vertebrates in the world and even by that time had become a paradigm for ecology and evolutionary studies.\u201d The forest immediately captivated Lister, a lecturer at Rensselaer Polytechnic University in the US. \u201cIt was and still is the most beautiful forest I have ever been in.

My dad replied, \u201cI\u2019m not going to touch the man\u2019s bottom!\u201d I started getting annoyed and said, \u201cDad, come on be professional \u2013 just touch the guy\u2019s bum.\u201d And then my dad got really angry and we had a shouting match outside in the car park of Space. The show finished after four series. We wanted it to carry on \u2013 it was evolving gradually. But [former Channel 4 head of entertainment] Kevin Lygo took us to lunch at some poncey club and did the TV schmooze on us. It felt like he was saying: \u201cIt\u2019s time to move out of your little fun corner of Channel 4 and join the evil conglomerate of mainstream entertainment.\u201d Piss or get off the pot, basically. But we didn\u2019t have the skills or the enthusiasm to do a mainstream show. So we dropped the ball and didn\u2019t really know what we were doing for a few years. It was only on the radio at 6Music that we found ourselves again.",

But that big, crisp 10.1in screen makes for a good digital photo frame, excellent kitchen helper and a solid smart home controller, particularly if you have any compatible smart cameras or doorbells you want to view without digging out your phone.</p> <p>It sounds really good too, and the built-in Zigbee smart home hub is a nice value-add. But you need an Amazon Prime subscription to get the most out of its video capabilities, and it\u2019s harder to blend in with home furnishings than some rivals.</p> <p>If you\u2019re already on board with Alexa and want a great big smart display, the new Echo Show is it. But it\u2019s no longer in a field of its own, and Google\u2019s excellent Home Hub is significantly cheaper at \u00a3139.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> good, big screen, sounds great, good for recipes, Amazon Prime Video, Alexa, YouTube and BBC iPlayer (in a browser), good smart home control, integrated Zigbee hub, Bluetooth</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> no 3.5mm socket, expensive, big and hard to blend in with furnishings, annoying \u201cTry Alexa\u201d tips you can\u2019t turn off, using a browser to get to video sites is irritating, no Netflix or most TV catch-up services</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9af4e0cc58181c0841e23ce64e94df193a3c0cfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9af4e0cc58181c0841e23ce64e94df193a3c0cfc/0_0_3886_2332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"amazon echo show review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swipe down from the top of the screen to quickly adjust settings and access smart home controls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Other reviews</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/09/amazon-echo-review-smaller-cheaper-alexa-gadget-new-second-generation\">Amazon Echo second-generation review: smaller, cheaper and better</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/05/amazon-echo-spot-review-cute-smart-speaker-screen-alarm-clock\">Amazon Echo Spot review: cute smart speaker with a screen</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/22/google-home-hub-review-smart-display-buy-google-assistant-digital-photo-frame\">Google Home Hub review: the smart display to buy</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/15/sonos-one-review-best-smart-speaker-audiophiles-amazon-alexa\">Sonos One review: the best smart speaker for audiophiles</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/13/apple-homepod-review-siri-best-sounding-smart-speaker\">Apple HomePod review: Siri lets down best sounding smart speaker</a></strong></p></li> </ul>",

Since the original Echo Show launched last year the software has been refined, but the experience is broadly the same. The Show is a voice-first Alexa speaker, with touch interactivity as an additional input rather than the core experience. If you never wanted to touch the screen beyond the initial set-up ,you wouldn\u2019t have to. When you do go to touch it, swipes and taps work as you might expect from a modern smartphone. Swipe down from the top to reveal a quick settings shade, including a smart home control panel, a place to trigger Alexa routines and one-tap access to alarms.

Even the on-screen keyboard works like a smartphone\u2019s, although it quickly gets tiring to use it at arm\u2019s length on the screen. Fortunately you only really need it for typing out passwords. Bigger, brighter and better The screen is now much larger at 10.1in on the diagonal, 720p HD, crisper and of higher quality. The difference is night and day between the old and new Echo Show. The design of the device looks a lot better too, shrinking the device around the screen and moving the speakers to the back of the casing. There\u2019s still a camera above the screen for selfies and video calling, which can now connect you to Skype as well as Amazon devices and the Alexa app. The improved screen makes it a better digital photo frame, displaying photos from your Amazon Photos library or various stock images. The size also helps with visibility from across the room, but somehow it looks more imposing than even the monolithic design of the old device. Surprisingly good speakers The lump at the back contains the speakers, which like the screen are significantly improved but less direct than the front-facing speakers of the previous device. The Show is the best-sounding smart display currently on the market, blowing away Google\u2019s Home Hub. The two 2in speakers and passive bass radiator produce a wider soundscape than most smart speakers and can easily fill a room, sounding best at around volume level 5 out of 10.

It doesn\u2019t have really deep bass (you can pair a separate \u00a3120 Echo Sub with it if you want more bass) or any real stereo separation. But the Echo Show is one of the better-sounding smart speakers available, coming somewhere in between the Echo and the brilliant Sonos One or more expensive Apple HomePod. One-stop-smart home control-shop The new Show has an integrated smart home hub, which means you can connect smart bulbs, switches and other devices that use the Zigbee wireless protocol straight to the Amazon device without the need for another hub. It works well for simple things, but devices such as Philips Hue bulbs often need their dedicated proprietary hub to perform advanced features and updates. Otherwise the smart display operates like any other Alexa device, connecting to smart home hubs and devices via your home wifi network or the internet. The sheer number of devices that support Alexa integration is bewildering, which means whatever you want to turn smart in your home probably can be and therefore controlled via voice or taps on the screen. Smart cameras and doorbells, including that from Amazon\u2019s Ring and Google\u2019s Nest, work particularly well, showing the live feed from your front door or elsewhere on command. But voice control is only one part of the equation. You can control devices from the Show\u2019s screen with a couple of taps and swipes, and through the Alexa app on your smartphone, which has improved considerably in the last couple of iterations. Lastly, Alexa now has \u201croutines\u201d that can perform a collection of different actions with one phrase or tap on the screen, such as saying \u201cgoodnight\u201d triggering off all the lights in the home to turn off. Movies and TV shows TV shows and movies from Amazon\u2019s Prime Video service work well on the 10.1in screen, with a relatively easy to use interface that can help you find the right show via taps or voice. Once playing you can control playback via voice, which is handy when things get hectic in the kitchen or similar. Other video services are a bit more complicated requiring a trip into the included Amazon Silk or Mozilla Firefox browser, which work like they do on an Android tablet.

The ingredients list is also always just a voice command or tap away, and Alexa can tell you precisely how much to put in of each thing in each step or repeat the instructions at any one time. Observations It routinely got stuck on one particular photo in my library, showing it for hours on end. If you\u2019re listening to music while cooking, the Show will just display recipes and steps without interrupting via voice. You can\u2019t turn off the tips of things to try through Alexa that show at the bottom of the screen when just showing photos, which is very annoying. You can disable the camera entirely if you want to, but if you don\u2019t trust Amazon with your data you shouldn\u2019t be buying an Alexa device. You can use the Echo Show as a Bluetooth speaker or connect it to a Bluetooth speaker. Despite the screen, shopping on the Echo Show is still tedious and better done via a phone or tablet. Price The Amazon Echo Show costs \u00a3220 and is available in black or white. For comparison, the original Echo Show was \u00a3200, the smaller Echo Spot is \u00a3120, and the Google Home Hub costs \u00a3139. Verdict The new Echo Show is easily one of the best smart displays available, and is an upgrade in almost every way over the old one, but at \u00a3220 it\u2019s also pretty expensive. At its core the Show is just an Alexa-powered smart speaker, and so most of its functions can be had for as little as \u00a350. But that big, crisp 10.1in screen makes for a good digital photo frame, excellent kitchen helper and a solid smart home controller, particularly if you have any compatible smart cameras or doorbells you want to view without digging out your phone. It sounds really good too, and the built-in Zigbee smart home hub is a nice value-add. But you need an Amazon Prime subscription to get the most out of its video capabilities, and it\u2019s harder to blend in with home furnishings than some rivals. If you\u2019re already on board with Alexa and want a great big smart display, the new Echo Show is it. But it\u2019s no longer in a field of its own, and Google\u2019s excellent Home Hub is significantly cheaper at \u00a3139. Pros: good, big screen, sounds great, good for recipes, Amazon Prime Video, Alexa, YouTube and BBC iPlayer (in a browser), good smart home control, integrated Zigbee hub, Bluetooth Cons: no 3.5mm socket, expensive, big and hard to blend in with furnishings, annoying \u201cTry Alexa\u201d tips you can\u2019t turn off, using a browser to get to video sites is irritating, no Netflix or most TV catch-up services Other reviews Amazon Echo second-generation review: smaller, cheaper and better Amazon Echo Spot review: cute smart speaker with a screen Google Home Hub review: the smart display to buy Sonos One review: the best smart speaker for audiophiles Apple HomePod review: Siri lets down best sounding smart speaker",

      "body": "<p>They had Richard Eyre on the radio last week. BBC Radio 4\u2019s PM programme brought in the former artistic director of the National Theatre in London to talk about the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46822529\">Duchess of Sussex being appointed royal patron</a>. It was a brief news item inspired by Meghan Markle, but it exposed the kind of paradoxes at the heart of every national theatre \u2013 paradoxes that continue to create flashpoints at the national theatres of Scotland, Wales and Ireland.</p> <p>First, presenter Evan Davis wondered if the NT was a \u201cbit shy\u201d about its royal connection. Eyre admitted he hadn\u2019t been too keen on the organisation rebranding itself as the Royal National Theatre when he took over in 1988. He thought there was a \u201cvirtue in the demotic National Theatre\u201d. But he had accepted the board\u2019s argument that the royal appellation gave the company valuable recognition from a sometimes resistant establishment. He seemed equally happy when the \u201cRoyal\u201d was quietly dropped by his successors.</p> <p>Nor did he disagree with the presenter\u2019s suggestion that a theatre should have a \u201cslightly subversive air\u201d, although he did point out it is only recently that theatres have been \u201cexplicitly critical of the establishment\u201d. Shakespeare, for one, depended on royal patronage and knew the risks involved in trying, like Hamlet, to catch the conscience of a king. Eyre recalled that, at the very point the \u201cRoyal\u201d was being added, the National Theatre had premiered Alan Bennett\u2019s A Question of Attribution with Prunella Scales doing a turn as the Queen. By the sound of it, a few monarchist feathers were ruffled on the board.</p> <p>All this is because a national theatre isn\u2019t just an organisation that puts on plays. It is also a symbol. Put the word \u201cnational\u201d in your name and you become a receptacle for a country\u2019s values. In what you do, the nation will seek to see the very definition of itself; a definition perhaps vaguely articulated, but intensely felt. Change your priorities, by being too regal or not regal enough, and you upset the nation\u2019s sense of its own identity.</p> <p>The matter of royal patronage is typically vexatious but there\u2019s little controversy here. Before the schisms of Brexit, any discussion about Englishness seemed to begin and end with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/billybragg\">Billy Bragg</a>. Few seemed concerned with what the word \u201cnational\u201d meant in the context of the National Theatre \u2013 even about which of the nations it supposedly represented. In London, it is possible to stage a state-of-the-nation play while remaining vague about the nation you mean. Not so elsewhere.</p> <p>When the National Theatre of Scotland was established in 2006, for example, none of the old cultural certainties applied. In the self-aware 21st century, it wasn\u2019t possible to make assumptions about universal truths, great plays and grand buildings as the Victorians had done when they conceived the first national theatres. Not only was the definition of Scotland up for grabs (Highland, lowland, urban, rural, Scots, Gaelic, none of the above \u2026), but the nature of theatre itself. Now, even the three-auditorium flexibility of London\u2019s National Theatre seemed limiting. That\u2019s why artistic director Vicky Featherstone began her inaugural season not with a well-made play in an ornate lyric theatre, but with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/arts/features/story/0,,1718665,00.html\">Home</a>, 10 site-specific performances in private flats, housing estates and island ferries. It was a provocation about what a national theatre could be, who it could be for and where it could take place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32bb5965002c2a75a8d4b623de833276e564a7d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32bb5965002c2a75a8d4b623de833276e564a7d8/0_84_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jackie Wylie, the current artistic director of the National Theatre of Scotland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theatre without walls ...

Most unhappy were the lobby who demanded a showcase for Scotland\u2019s earliest classic, Sir David Lyndsay\u2019s 16th-century A Satire of the Three Estates. They reasoned that a theatre dedicated to the nation\u2019s excellence had a duty to perform the nation\u2019s most excellent play. Others felt the nation had more recent achievements to celebrate. But, largely, Featherstone\u2019s \u201ctheatre without walls\u201d policy sidestepped the pitfalls. This was a theatre that could be all things to all people.</p> <p>Sensitivities run close to the surface, however, and it means that when a row broke out last week about the employment practices of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/08/irelands-national-theatre-abbey-accused-of-deserting-irish-talent\">the Abbey</a>, Ireland\u2019s national theatre, it seemed to be about more than casting decisions and freelance opportunities. Ostensibly, what is at stake is the declining number of Irish-based actors who have been directly employed by the Abbey. More than 300 actors, designers and directors signed an open letter complaining that the theatre had reduced the number of Ireland-based actors it had employed by 54% and caused \u201cdevastation\u201d in the freelance theatre community. They claimed there will not have been an Ireland-based actor in an Abbey Theatre production on an Abbey stage from 8 September 2018 until 23 February 2019. (The wording is crucial: there have been Irish actors on the stage in that time, such as the dozen who starred in the critically acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.abbeytheatre.ie/whats-on/asking-for-it/\">Asking for It</a>, but that was a co-production \u201cin association\u201d with the Abbey.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f7edd9745a375b4cacd913902f95e215a0df78b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f7edd9745a375b4cacd913902f95e215a0df78b/0_330_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Negga in Hamlet at Dublin theatre festival, October 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruth Negga in Hamlet at Dublin theatre festival \u2013 Negga was one of 300 signatories to a recent letter complaining about the Abbey, Ireland\u2019s national theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ros Kavanagh</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The theatre has responded sympathetically to the letter, but ironically, the changes have come about partly as a result of the desire of directors Graham McLaren and Neil Murray to better reflect the nation in all its variety.

Where the management sees diversity and opportunities for \u201cartists who had not previously gained access to their national theatre\u201d, the freelance signatories, who include Ciar\u00e1n Hinds and Sin\u00e9ad Cusack, see \u201cdevastation amongst our ranks\u201d, arguing that a strategy that was \u201cadmirable in theory\u201d was bringing about \u201cless diversity and reduced employment, not more\u201d.</p> <p>Such arguments are impassioned not only because of the immediate financial impact but also because of the status of the Abbey. If the national theatre can do this, the complainants seemed to say, what hope do we have for every other theatre in the land? It\u2019s the same reason a correspondent to the Irish Times wondered if there was a jinx on the Abbey. \u201cOpen any book that has been penned on the subject since its foundation in 1904,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/letters/the-abbey-and-cultural-institutions-1.3752697\">wrote Ursula Hough-Gormley</a>, \u201cand you will read of trauma, controversy and sometimes as much violence and drama in the auditorium as any play it ever presented on stage.\u201d She was right about the theatre\u2019s volatile history, but wrong about the jinx. Rather, it is a building that lays claim to the nation\u2019s identity, something that will always be fluid, contentious and up for a challenge. We fight over our national theatres the same way we fight over our country.</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to look far into the Abbey\u2019s history to see how true this is. In 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/nov/09/irish-theatre-women-abbey-programme\">the theatre found itself at the centre of the campaign #WakingtheFeminists</a> after it had announced a virtually all-male lineup for its centenary year in 2016.

The agent Clare Alexander saw the Nigerian author\u2019s submission and asked her if she had anything else. \u201cThat was very exciting for me, but I didn\u2019t have anything that I wanted to give them,\u201d Braithwaite recalls. \u201cSo I let a year go by where I kept convincing myself I was going to write something fantastic, and I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Relaxing on a sofa in her bright yellow jumpsuit, sheepskin boots and green braids, her smile never far from a laugh, it\u2019s hard to imagine Braithwaite paralysed by doubt. It wasn\u2019t that she felt under pressure, she says, but after working for a publisher in Lagos, \u201cyou know what\u2019s good and what\u2019s not. I just had high standards for myself.\u201d</p> <p>As the end of 2017 approached, with her 30th birthday just around the corner, Braithwaite told herself she was being ridiculous: \u201cForget about the great novel, just write something for yourself that\u2019s fun.\u201d</p> <p>The novel that broke the dam is a fast-paced, deadpan story of two sisters: nurse Korede and her younger sister Ayoola, a beautiful clothing designer, who has a sizeable following on Instagram and whose boyfriends keep winding up dead. One of them gets food poisoning and starts frothing at the mouth, another starts screaming at her so she stabs him with a knife in what she claims is self-defence. But when Ayoola needs help getting rid of the body, Korede is ready with the bleach.</p> <p><em>I stand up and rinse the gloves in the sink. Ayoola is looking at my reflection in the mirror.</em></p> <p><em>\u201cWe need to move the body,\u201d I tell her.</em></p> <p><em>\u201cAre you angry at me?\u201d</em></p> <p><em>Perhaps a normal person would be angry, but what I feel now is a pressing need to dispose of the body.</em></p> <p>Born in 1988, Braithwaite has a younger brother, Ore, and two younger sisters, Siji and Obafunke. With only two years between her and Obafunke, Braithwaite says the two of them are \u201cgoing through life together \u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSometimes we hate each other. Sometimes we are really not speaking, but I\u2019ve noticed that when push comes to shove we can also band together quite tightly. You know that, whatever happens, that person will be there for you.\u201d</p> <p>As an older sibling, Braithwaite has an intimate understanding of the responsibility thrust on Korede to look after Ayoola, remembering how her own mother once told her she had to be \u201clike a dustbin. You\u2019ve got to take whatever shit, whatever rubbish comes your way. And you have to be gracious about it.\u201d</p> <p>A novel that puts the relationship between two sisters at its heart, with men as supporting characters who may or may not make it to the final act, has been greeted as a riposte to crime fiction where the plot is so often set in motion by the gruesome <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/26/staunch-prize-launched-for-thrillers-that-avoid-sexual-violence-against-women\" title=\"\">death of young women</a>. \u201cAs an individual I\u2019m attracted to strong female characters \u2013 my characters have always been people who own themselves. Even if they\u2019re strongly doing something wrong, they\u2019ve always been powerful people.\u201d </p> <p>As the body count rises and the trauma that shaped Korede and Ayoola\u2019s childhood becomes clear, the novel darkens towards a sensibility that Braithwaite claims for her own. But she says it only goes so far. \u201cI knew it was going to have darkness, but I didn\u2019t want to stay in it, I didn\u2019t want to immerse myself, so it became very matter of fact. I needed my characters to do this thing and then move on.\u201d</p> <p>This fast pace and light touch was the key to unlocking the humour that fizzes through the novel. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to be funny, but my characters and I \u2013 we didn\u2019t want to wallow in it.\u201d</p> <p>Braithwaite spent her childhood in Nigeria and the UK, her family moving to Southgate in north London before she started primary school, then returning to Lagos when her brother was born in 2001. She attended sixth form at a boarding school in Shropshire, then studied law and creative writing at Surrey University and Kingston University before moving back to Lagos in 2012. There she worked as an assistant editor at the independent publisher Kachifo and as a production manager at her father\u2019s education and entertainment company, Ajapaworld.</p> <p>This back-and-forth upbringing was a long way from the violence of the Biafran war portrayed in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/28/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-feminism-racism-sexism-gender-metoo\" title=\"\">Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s Half of a Yellow Sun</a> or the political chaos that forms the backdrop to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/14/ayobami-adebayo-men-women-sacrifices-nigeria\" title=\"\">Ay\u00f2b\u00e1mi Ad\u00e9b\u00e1y\u00f2\u2019s</a> Stay With Me, but Braithwaite is unabashed that her novel makes no attempt to address her country\u2019s difficult past.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have that knowledge. I can\u2019t give you what I don\u2019t have,\u201d she says. The idea that writers can represent some universal Nigerian experience is a chimera, when a universal Nigerian experience simply doesn\u2019t exist, she explains. \u201cWe have a wide divide between classes and we have a wide divide between cultures because we\u2019re from different tribes, we have different religions. You don\u2019t have to walk very far to see someone who has a really different life from you.\u201d She may live in a house where all you have to do to turn on the light is flick a switch, but in Lagos you only have to cross the road to find someone who has never had electricity. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to write a novel and people feel that I\u2019m speaking to a Nigerian experience \u2013 I\u2019m speaking to my experience, to the things I\u2019m interested in, and that\u2019s all I can do.\u201d</p> <p>Thirteen years after the publication of the Kenyan author Binyavanga Wainaina\u2019s satirical essay <a href=\"https://granta.com/how-to-write-about-africa/\" title=\"\">How to Write About Africa</a>, Braithwaite says there is still pressure for African writers to speak for a whole continent, but that it is beginning to change. \u201cAfricans are hungry for different types of stories. Within our own community, people are hungry for something else, for something different. They want more crime, they want more fantasy, they want sci-fi or whatever. Things are already becoming more diverse, but it\u2019s going to become ridiculous \u2013 there\u2019s going to be a lot more.\u201d</p> <p>Nigerian readers may be looking for something a little different, but Braithwaite admits she doesn\u2019t know what they will make of a novel called My Sister, the Serial Killer.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a little bit worried about that.\u201d A conspiratorial laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to react. I think some of them will be excited for it, but I think some of them will call me to task, because I\u2019m not speaking to everyone\u2019s experience.\u201d As the head of a drama department at her local church, where she organises plays and sometimes writes scripts, Braithwaite says she was not sure if members of the congregation might object, but, \u201cthey haven\u2019t asked me to step down, so,\u201d another laugh, \u201cso far, so good.\u201d</p> <p>The disquiet about writing such a godless book extends closer to home as well. Braithwaite says she didn\u2019t tell her grandma the whole title of the book at first, referring to it only as \u201cMy Sister \u2026\u201d Her parents have already decided it is far too dark for them, and her father asked why she had to write a story without hope. \u201cWe would sit down and have these conversations, and he would say: \u2018I don\u2019t think they should be putting darkness back into the world. You need to own your responsibility as a creator.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Braithwaite hopes she can write something one day that \u201cdoes justice\u201d to her beliefs, but she is clear that a novelist\u2019s first responsibility is to fiction itself. \u201cI like to have fun,\u201d she says. \u201cThe books where I can tell I\u2019m being taught something are a trial in the reading. If there\u2019s a story and you learn something along the way, it\u2019s a bonus.\u201d She still struggles with the tension between her faith and the moral ambiguity of her fiction, but \u201cpeople say they read it and laughed. I like to think that, in my own little way, I\u2019ve brought joy into the world.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 My Sister, the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite (Atlantic Books, \u00a312.99).

      "body": "<h2>The River: Walter Presents<br>10.35pm, Channel 4 </h2> <p>The latest Scandi-noir off the rank is a chilling Norwegian crime drama set in the Arctic village of Djupelv, close to the Russian border. It begins with a macabre discovery made by a young girl from an isolated community. Soon she disappears without trace and local police begin an investigation hampered by military exercises in the region. Based on real events, this is an icy slowburner, but intriguing all the same. The full series of eight episodes is available to view on All4 after the first instalment finishes. <strong>Mike Bradley </strong></p> <h2>The Humpback Whale: Birth of a Giant <br>7pm, Channel 5 </h2> <p>The early years of the humpback whale are a tad more fraught than our own: mere months after its birth, the vast mammal is expected to embark upon a 5,000-mile migration south in search of food. This one-off follows the preparation period for this trek, one that features hunger, fatigue and whale lice. <strong>Gwilym Mumford</strong></p> <h2>Ava Gardner: Alegria and Decadence <br>9pm, Sky Arts </h2> <p>By the time she was 28, this Hollywood siren had the world at her feet. But after saying farewell to husband Frank Sinatra she said hola to Spain, exiling herself in Madrid under General Franco\u2019s repressive regime for the next 14 years, as this fascinating documentary relates. <strong>Ali Catterall</strong></p> <h2>The Passage <br>9pm, Fox </h2> <p>Based on Justin Cronin\u2019s novels, this somewhat thin thriller concerns a secret facility containing a virus that could cure all disease \u2013 but which also has the potential to wipe out the human race. Panicked by a global flu pandemic, scientists order the capture of a test subject in the form of 10-year-old girl Amy Bellafonte (Saniyya Sidney). <strong>MB</strong></p> <h2>Pothole Wars<br>9pm, ITV</h2> <p>Seemingly commissioned by pulling a Daily Mail headline out of a tombola, this documentary looks at the blight of potholes, which cause damage to vehicles and injuries to pedestrians and cost taxpayers billions to fix.

      "bodyText": "The River: Walter Presents 10.35pm, Channel 4 The latest Scandi-noir off the rank is a chilling Norwegian crime drama set in the Arctic village of Djupelv, close to the Russian border. It begins with a macabre discovery made by a young girl from an isolated community. Soon she disappears without trace and local police begin an investigation hampered by military exercises in the region. Based on real events, this is an icy slowburner, but intriguing all the same. The full series of eight episodes is available to view on All4 after the first instalment finishes. Mike Bradley The Humpback Whale: Birth of a Giant 7pm, Channel 5 The early years of the humpback whale are a tad more fraught than our own: mere months after its birth, the vast mammal is expected to embark upon a 5,000-mile migration south in search of food. This one-off follows the preparation period for this trek, one that features hunger, fatigue and whale lice. Gwilym Mumford Ava Gardner: Alegria and Decadence 9pm, Sky Arts By the time she was 28, this Hollywood siren had the world at her feet. But after saying farewell to husband Frank Sinatra she said hola to Spain, exiling herself in Madrid under General Franco\u2019s repressive regime for the next 14 years, as this fascinating documentary relates. Ali Catterall The Passage 9pm, Fox Based on Justin Cronin\u2019s novels, this somewhat thin thriller concerns a secret facility containing a virus that could cure all disease \u2013 but which also has the potential to wipe out the human race. Panicked by a global flu pandemic, scientists order the capture of a test subject in the form of 10-year-old girl Amy Bellafonte (Saniyya Sidney). MB Pothole Wars 9pm, ITV Seemingly commissioned by pulling a Daily Mail headline out of a tombola, this documentary looks at the blight of potholes, which cause damage to vehicles and injuries to pedestrians and cost taxpayers billions to fix. What can be done? Talking heads include a spokesperson from the Asphalt Industry Alliance.

      "body": "<p>In 2001, before 9/11, the satirical US news source the Onion was where a lot of us got most of our international news. OK, so it may not have had much actual information, but it was a pretty flaccid time. Everyone was pretending to be the good guy, the world\u2019s policeman. It was all cops and no robbers. Then suddenly, when the World Trade Center was hit, satire seemed unequal to the new seriousness. The Onion\u2019s first headline after the event \u2013 Holy Fucking Shit \u2013 served to underline the point. But the following month it was back: <a href=\"https://entertainment.theonion.com/a-shattered-nation-longs-to-care-about-stupid-bullshit-1819566188\" title=\"\">A Shattered Nation Longs to Care About Stupid Bullshit Again</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/13/robbie-williams-blasting-black-sabbath-at-jimmy-page-letter-claims\">Robbie Williams 'blasting Black Sabbath' at Jimmy Page, letter claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Our position today is not exactly the same. We\u2019re shattered, sure: but we\u2019re not so much unable to care about stupid bullshit as absolutely mired in it. What I miss is nuance, absurdity, the consolations of the trivial, the ability to laugh at one another without scorn, the ability to laugh at ourselves without getting obliterated. If our national psyche were one person, it would be Robbie Williams. It\u2019s gone on quite a journey, and it\u2019s landed in a bad place. And we may never go back to the carefree Robbie Williams of the 90s, but I feel sure we\u2019re going to emerge from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/13/robbie-williams-blasting-black-sabbath-at-jimmy-page-letter-claims\" title=\"\">raging Robbie we glimpse</a> in the state papers of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.</p> <p>In case you missed it: Williams lives next door to Jimmy Page, formerly of Led Zeppelin, in Holland Park \u2013 Page in a Grade I-listed building, Williams in a Grade II. It is a tale not often told about the super-rich that they fight constantly over extensions. There is a cliche about middle-class neighbours fighting, which is always a party wall dispute. There is a cliche about working-class neighbours fighting, and that is always because one of them is a \u201cproblem family\u201d.</p> <p>High net-worth individuals have vicious territorial skirmishes because the stakes are so high: one of them always wants to dig down seven storeys to create a gym and a dungeon for their enemies, and that usually knocks the other one\u2019s house down. But it\u2019s a peculiarity of this century that the richer you are, the more likely it is that your behaviour will be taken for eccentricity or charm. By the time you reach billionaire status, you can literally shoot your neighbour in the face and you\u2019re a \u201ctroubled playboy\u201d, while if you are in receipt of any benefits, you can drop an egg on someone\u2019s porch and it will make you a \u201cheartless thug\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ceb23fa4aa5b3a7405cf3128a50a96938ab83df1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ceb23fa4aa5b3a7405cf3128a50a96938ab83df1/0_14_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robbie Williams\u2019s home in Holland Park, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robbie Williams\u2019s home in Holland Park, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Mirzoeff/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Had it been Page who wanted a swimming pool, I would have understood. Now 75 and rich beyond imagining for decades, he has probably forgotten that municipal pools exist. Williams, only 44, has no such excuse and could use a fancy gym. But that\u2019s not the extent of his mischief: according to the filed complaint, he has been tormenting Page with the music of his rivals \u2013 specifically, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd and Deep Purple \u2013 at outlandish volume. \u201cHe obviously knows this upsets Mr Jimmy Page,\u201d said the <a href=\"https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/idoxWAM/doc/Public%20Comment%20-%20General%20Comment-2173553.pdf?extension=.pdf&amp;id=2173553&amp;location=VOLUME2&amp;contentType=application/pdf&amp;pageCount=2\" title=\"\">letter to the council</a>, which is signed only \u201cJohnny\u201d. It\u2019s opaque to me why this should be the most upsetting music: surely it would be more grating to play Take That? But the really confusing behaviour is that Williams also dresses up as Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant, \u201cwearing a long-hair wig, and stuffing a pillow under his shirt in an attempt to mock or imitate Mr Robert Plant\u2019s beer belly that he has acquired in his older age\u201d. Given that Page and Plant themselves don\u2019t get on, this is a curious taunt, unless its underlying message is, \u201cI can\u2019t even remember which of those two old has-beens you are\u201d, in which case, what a burn.</p> <p>Robbie Williams\u2019s people deny all this as fanciful, and say the singer is abiding by building regulations like any responsible citizen. And that disappoints me, too, since his charm was never that of the responsible citizen. He was the one with such an advanced sense of play over pragmatism that he walked away from the most money-spinning boyband of his era because he couldn\u2019t choke out one more ballad. He was so appetitive that, forced to part company with alcohol for reasons of chaos, he used to drink <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/feb/15/popandrock.healthandwellbeing\" title=\"\">36 espressos a day</a>. Explaining an antic last year \u2013 he <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-cup/2018/06/14/world-cup-2018-opening-ceremony-live-updates-russia-event/\" title=\"\">gave the audience the finger</a> in the middle of a song he was singing for the opening of the World Cup \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/robbie-williams-breaks-silence-on-flipping-the-finger-at-world-cup-i-was-signalling-a-one-minute-a3866711.html\" title=\"\">he said</a>, \u201cNothing actually pops into my head. There\u2019s a block between me and sense and then something happens and then five minutes later, I\u2019m like, \u2018Did I just do that?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>His life read like a quest for the wellspring of human ridiculousness, the tale of a kind of toddler conquistador, armour-plated by his own sense of self\u2011parody. And now, whatever the truth of his fancy\u2011dress outfits and the finer details of the noise pollution, he\u2019s willing to die in a ditch over a swimming pool. Nobody could bring a sense of humour to this dispute; indoor fitness equipment is not funny. The journey from unreflective mischief to dug-in interior decoration must be one of the saddest blind alleys of wealth. The only way to resolve this is for these two gentlemen to go on tour together.</p> <p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "In 2001, before 9/11, the satirical US news source the Onion was where a lot of us got most of our international news. OK, so it may not have had much actual information, but it was a pretty flaccid time. Everyone was pretending to be the good guy, the world\u2019s policeman. It was all cops and no robbers. Then suddenly, when the World Trade Center was hit, satire seemed unequal to the new seriousness. The Onion\u2019s first headline after the event \u2013 Holy Fucking Shit \u2013 served to underline the point. But the following month it was back: A Shattered Nation Longs to Care About Stupid Bullshit Again. Our position today is not exactly the same. We\u2019re shattered, sure: but we\u2019re not so much unable to care about stupid bullshit as absolutely mired in it. What I miss is nuance, absurdity, the consolations of the trivial, the ability to laugh at one another without scorn, the ability to laugh at ourselves without getting obliterated. If our national psyche were one person, it would be Robbie Williams. It\u2019s gone on quite a journey, and it\u2019s landed in a bad place. And we may never go back to the carefree Robbie Williams of the 90s, but I feel sure we\u2019re going to emerge from the raging Robbie we glimpse in the state papers of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. In case you missed it: Williams lives next door to Jimmy Page, formerly of Led Zeppelin, in Holland Park \u2013 Page in a Grade I-listed building, Williams in a Grade II. It is a tale not often told about the super-rich that they fight constantly over extensions. There is a cliche about middle-class neighbours fighting, which is always a party wall dispute. There is a cliche about working-class neighbours fighting, and that is always because one of them is a \u201cproblem family\u201d. High net-worth individuals have vicious territorial skirmishes because the stakes are so high: one of them always wants to dig down seven storeys to create a gym and a dungeon for their enemies, and that usually knocks the other one\u2019s house down. But it\u2019s a peculiarity of this century that the richer you are, the more likely it is that your behaviour will be taken for eccentricity or charm. By the time you reach billionaire status, you can literally shoot your neighbour in the face and you\u2019re a \u201ctroubled playboy\u201d, while if you are in receipt of any benefits, you can drop an egg on someone\u2019s porch and it will make you a \u201cheartless thug\u201d. Had it been Page who wanted a swimming pool, I would have understood. Now 75 and rich beyond imagining for decades, he has probably forgotten that municipal pools exist. Williams, only 44, has no such excuse and could use a fancy gym. But that\u2019s not the extent of his mischief: according to the filed complaint, he has been tormenting Page with the music of his rivals \u2013 specifically, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd and Deep Purple \u2013 at outlandish volume. \u201cHe obviously knows this upsets Mr Jimmy Page,\u201d said the letter to the council, which is signed only \u201cJohnny\u201d. It\u2019s opaque to me why this should be the most upsetting music: surely it would be more grating to play Take That? But the really confusing behaviour is that Williams also dresses up as Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant, \u201cwearing a long-hair wig, and stuffing a pillow under his shirt in an attempt to mock or imitate Mr Robert Plant\u2019s beer belly that he has acquired in his older age\u201d. Given that Page and Plant themselves don\u2019t get on, this is a curious taunt, unless its underlying message is, \u201cI can\u2019t even remember which of those two old has-beens you are\u201d, in which case, what a burn. Robbie Williams\u2019s people deny all this as fanciful, and say the singer is abiding by building regulations like any responsible citizen. And that disappoints me, too, since his charm was never that of the responsible citizen. He was the one with such an advanced sense of play over pragmatism that he walked away from the most money-spinning boyband of his era because he couldn\u2019t choke out one more ballad. He was so appetitive that, forced to part company with alcohol for reasons of chaos, he used to drink 36 espressos a day. Explaining an antic last year \u2013 he gave the audience the finger in the middle of a song he was singing for the opening of the World Cup \u2013 he said, \u201cNothing actually pops into my head. There\u2019s a block between me and sense and then something happens and then five minutes later, I\u2019m like, \u2018Did I just do that?\u2019\u201d His life read like a quest for the wellspring of human ridiculousness, the tale of a kind of toddler conquistador, armour-plated by his own sense of self\u2011parody. And now, whatever the truth of his fancy\u2011dress outfits and the finer details of the noise pollution, he\u2019s willing to die in a ditch over a swimming pool. Nobody could bring a sense of humour to this dispute; indoor fitness equipment is not funny. The journey from unreflective mischief to dug-in interior decoration must be one of the saddest blind alleys of wealth. The only way to resolve this is for these two gentlemen to go on tour together. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>This week the fantasy island finally gets its comeuppance. For two and a half years the UK has bubbled with delusions and dishonesty.

Since June 2016, we have gone from dreams of exporting \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/11/brexiteers-trade-brexit-molly-scott-cato-greens\" title=\"\">innovative jam</a>\u201d, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/07/no-deal-brexit-rehearsal-tests-traffic-congestion-in-kent\" title=\"\">state-sponsored traffic jams on the A256</a> outside Manston.

Jeremy Corbyn plans within hours to put down a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/13/corbyn-promises-no-confidence-motion-against-may-soon\" title=\"\">motion of no confidence</a>. And even if the opposition fails to topple the government, May then has until next Monday to magic up a plan B. If our much-buffeted prime minister needs solace, she may find it in the observation of that canny political strategist Lenin: \u201cThere are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/14/brexit-latest-news-theresa-may-speech-liam-fox-claims-no-deal-survivable-as-may-launches-last-minute-bid-to-rescue-her-deal-politics-live\">Brexit: Theresa May urges MPs to 'take a second look' at her deal \u2013 Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amid the hysteria, one question will be asked as never before: What Does Jeremy Think? In normal times, any opposition chief counts for little more than the leader of a Greek chorus. But British politics does not ordinarily encompass a disintegrating minority government, a prime minister out of ideas and drained of authority, and a parliament making the single biggest foreign policy decision in decades. In this emergency, Corbyn has it within his power over the next few days to shape Brexit and alter the course of Britain\u2019s future. What should he do?</p> <p>I can already hear Corbyn\u2019s critics. Oh, they huff, he\u2019s been useless. Hopeless. Like any blood-red Bennite, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/31/path-second-referendum-labour-win-westminster-brexit-power\" title=\"\">he\u2019s always distrusted the EU</a>. Now, when he should be leading, he cowers behind a composite of fig leaves. This argument leaves out two big things. As opposition party leaders, Corbyn or Vince Cable or Caroline Lucas can heckle all they like, yet it means nothing \u2013 until May\u2019s government is defeated. Second, the Labour coalition stretches from the former coalfields of south Wales to the yoga studios of South Kensington. A fissured and fragile thing, Brexit could easily break it apart. However unheroic he looks, in his hemming and hawing Corbyn has played a weak hand well.</p> <p>But as of tonight, Labour\u2019s self-styled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/26/keir-starmer-no-constructive-ambiguity-brexit-cliff-edge-labour-will-avoid-transitional-deal\" title=\"\">constructive ambiguity</a>\u201d ceases to be a constructive position. In the uproar that follows, it should first hang back. Let Jacob Rees-Mogg wave around his no deal: he doesn\u2019t have the parliamentary numbers. Let Nick Boles and his allies put forward that Norway-style halfway house: their biggest roadblock is at No 10. May spent two years playing to her party\u2019s hard right by decrying any attempt at a Brexit compromise as a betrayal \u2013 and the past six months flogging a compromise. The resulting furious disappointment is her own bitter harvest.</p> <p>Apart from bagging herself a place as a cautionary chapter in any history of expectations management, May has also closed off any chance of a soft Brexit. She has defined Brexit as about keeping out migrants \u2013 a definition that cannot be met by any Norway-style deal. Imagine how David Davis, Esther McVey and the other headbangers on her backbenches and in the press will treat any agreement that leaves the UK paying a large fee to take its rules from Brussels. It did not need to be this way, but these are the people to whom May has regularly flung hunks of raw meat; she cannot starve them now.</p> <p>Throughout this Tory implosion, Corbyn needs only to tut sadly and remind voters that they\u2019ve had no effective government since June 2016. The harder question is what Labour does if a backbencher puts forward an amendment for a second referendum. The leadership expects such a proposal, and is still debating how to respond. At this point, it should surely come out in support.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/14/the-meaningful-vote-on-theresa-may-brexit-deal-what-happens-next\">The meaningful vote on May's Brexit deal \u2013 what happens next?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Such a move is far riskier than diehards for a people\u2019s vote allow. To many who in 2016 supported Brexit, it will look as if their once in a lifetime democratic choice has been cancelled. There could be uproar, in parliament, in the press and on the streets. Only two people are guaranteed to get a boost from any second referendum: Nigel Farage and Tommy Robinson.</p> <p>Of less concern, the Labour party could also split as a result. Senior insiders estimate that at least three members of the shadow cabinet would quit. It is by no means certain that MPs would back another referendum.</p> <p>Yet what other options are there? Westminster is now paralysed by indecision, able only to veto suggestions but never to come to agreement. No Tory MP will blow up their career by agreeing to another snap election. Even pushing back the March deadline for leaving which, given the volume of outstanding parliamentary business must surely now be inevitable, doesn\u2019t help. For two and a half years the UK has had next to no effective government. Fiscal policy is on autopilot, vast tranches of the civil service have been diverted to Brexit preparation, and still the UK circles the same question.</p> <p>If there is a second referendum, Labour will back remain. How it campaigns will matter as never before. Remain\u2019s chances will rest squarely on winning back Labour leave voters \u2013 making a case both for staying in the EU and for upending the status quo at home. That means Tory remainers somehow agreeing to let Corbyn get some of his policies on the statute books. And the beached whales of the remain campaign \u2013 the likes of Tony Blair \u2013 will need to be cleared away.</p> <p>It will also mean Labour squarely making the case for the EU being better for working people than Brexit. Without <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/18/brexiteers-paid-holidays-millions-britons-eu-working-time-directive-rights\" title=\"\">the EU\u2019s working time directive</a>, they could say, British workers wouldn\u2019t have the legal right to paid holidays. Indeed, Michael Gove and Boris Johnson have reportedly plotted to repeal such rights as soon as Britain leaves. Equal pay for women, protection for agency workers: such basics have come from the EU, often despite resistance from the British government.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/14/mps-voters-may-brexit-deal-tuesday-vote\">MPs are lying to voters \u2013 there is no alternative to May\u2019s Brexit deal | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some on the left will ask, but what about those EU state aid rules that get in the way of building a new economy? Yet research by two EU competition law experts found that of the 26 economic proposals in Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/29/corbyn-reignites-labour-debate-over-eu-rules-on-state-aid-and-socialist-manifesto\" title=\"\">all but two</a> would not require any state aid notification. And researchers concluded that Brussels would allow the other two to pass. Besides, under Labour\u2019s current proposal for a customs union, the UK would still be subject to state-aid rules.</p> <p>While I understand the sentiments of those who want a leftwing Brexit, many of their positions sound like flights of fantasy, by those who will never have to suffer the worst consequences. Against them, I\u2019d weigh up the consequences that await low-paid migrant workers \u2013 and I know which side deserves the most support from the left.</p> <p>\u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist and senior economics commentator</p>",

      "bodyText": "This week the fantasy island finally gets its comeuppance. For two and a half years the UK has bubbled with delusions and dishonesty. About the country we are and the one we could be, about the glittering prizes our leaders will wrangle from Europe, or about how the entire train ride can be stopped. Since June 2016, we have gone from dreams of exporting \u201cinnovative jam\u201d, to state-sponsored traffic jams on the A256 outside Manston. Now at last those fantasies collide with reality \u2013 and the result will be chaos. The timetable is remorseless. This evening, Theresa May puts her Brexit deal to MPs and, on the one solitary piece of legislation that will define her premiership, she stands to be badly beaten. Jeremy Corbyn plans within hours to put down a motion of no confidence. And even if the opposition fails to topple the government, May then has until next Monday to magic up a plan B. If our much-buffeted prime minister needs solace, she may find it in the observation of that canny political strategist Lenin: \u201cThere are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.\u201d Amid the hysteria, one question will be asked as never before: What Does Jeremy Think? In normal times, any opposition chief counts for little more than the leader of a Greek chorus. But British politics does not ordinarily encompass a disintegrating minority government, a prime minister out of ideas and drained of authority, and a parliament making the single biggest foreign policy decision in decades. In this emergency, Corbyn has it within his power over the next few days to shape Brexit and alter the course of Britain\u2019s future. What should he do? I can already hear Corbyn\u2019s critics. Oh, they huff, he\u2019s been useless. Hopeless. Like any blood-red Bennite, he\u2019s always distrusted the EU. Now, when he should be leading, he cowers behind a composite of fig leaves. This argument leaves out two big things. As opposition party leaders, Corbyn or Vince Cable or Caroline Lucas can heckle all they like, yet it means nothing \u2013 until May\u2019s government is defeated. Second, the Labour coalition stretches from the former coalfields of south Wales to the yoga studios of South Kensington. A fissured and fragile thing, Brexit could easily break it apart. However unheroic he looks, in his hemming and hawing Corbyn has played a weak hand well. But as of tonight, Labour\u2019s self-styled \u201cconstructive ambiguity\u201d ceases to be a constructive position. In the uproar that follows, it should first hang back. Let Jacob Rees-Mogg wave around his no deal: he doesn\u2019t have the parliamentary numbers. Let Nick Boles and his allies put forward that Norway-style halfway house: their biggest roadblock is at No 10. May spent two years playing to her party\u2019s hard right by decrying any attempt at a Brexit compromise as a betrayal \u2013 and the past six months flogging a compromise. The resulting furious disappointment is her own bitter harvest. Apart from bagging herself a place as a cautionary chapter in any history of expectations management, May has also closed off any chance of a soft Brexit. She has defined Brexit as about keeping out migrants \u2013 a definition that cannot be met by any Norway-style deal. Imagine how David Davis, Esther McVey and the other headbangers on her backbenches and in the press will treat any agreement that leaves the UK paying a large fee to take its rules from Brussels. It did not need to be this way, but these are the people to whom May has regularly flung hunks of raw meat; she cannot starve them now. Throughout this Tory implosion, Corbyn needs only to tut sadly and remind voters that they\u2019ve had no effective government since June 2016. The harder question is what Labour does if a backbencher puts forward an amendment for a second referendum. The leadership expects such a proposal, and is still debating how to respond. At this point, it should surely come out in support. Such a move is far riskier than diehards for a people\u2019s vote allow. To many who in 2016 supported Brexit, it will look as if their once in a lifetime democratic choice has been cancelled. There could be uproar, in parliament, in the press and on the streets. Only two people are guaranteed to get a boost from any second referendum: Nigel Farage and Tommy Robinson. Of less concern, the Labour party could also split as a result. Senior insiders estimate that at least three members of the shadow cabinet would quit. It is by no means certain that MPs would back another referendum. Yet what other options are there? Westminster is now paralysed by indecision, able only to veto suggestions but never to come to agreement. No Tory MP will blow up their career by agreeing to another snap election. Even pushing back the March deadline for leaving which, given the volume of outstanding parliamentary business must surely now be inevitable, doesn\u2019t help. For two and a half years the UK has had next to no effective government. Fiscal policy is on autopilot, vast tranches of the civil service have been diverted to Brexit preparation, and still the UK circles the same question. If there is a second referendum, Labour will back remain. How it campaigns will matter as never before. Remain\u2019s chances will rest squarely on winning back Labour leave voters \u2013 making a case both for staying in the EU and for upending the status quo at home. That means Tory remainers somehow agreeing to let Corbyn get some of his policies on the statute books. And the beached whales of the remain campaign \u2013 the likes of Tony Blair \u2013 will need to be cleared away. It will also mean Labour squarely making the case for the EU being better for working people than Brexit. Without the EU\u2019s working time directive, they could say, British workers wouldn\u2019t have the legal right to paid holidays. Indeed, Michael Gove and Boris Johnson have reportedly plotted to repeal such rights as soon as Britain leaves. Equal pay for women, protection for agency workers: such basics have come from the EU, often despite resistance from the British government. Some on the left will ask, but what about those EU state aid rules that get in the way of building a new economy? Yet research by two EU competition law experts found that of the 26 economic proposals in Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto, all but two would not require any state aid notification. And researchers concluded that Brussels would allow the other two to pass. Besides, under Labour\u2019s current proposal for a customs union, the UK would still be subject to state-aid rules. While I understand the sentiments of those who want a leftwing Brexit, many of their positions sound like flights of fantasy, by those who will never have to suffer the worst consequences. Against them, I\u2019d weigh up the consequences that await low-paid migrant workers \u2013 and I know which side deserves the most support from the left. \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist and senior economics commentator",

Taken as a whole, the 1,954 miles of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-mexico-border\">US-Mexican border</a> is a place of astounding diversity \u2013 of terrain, of land use, of city and countryside, of ethnicity.

With the impasse over funding, which prompted the shutdown, administration officials have started to describe what\u2019s already here, as well as repairs to a two-mile stretch of fence in Calexico 100 miles to the east, as <a href=\"https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/DHS-El-Centro-Border-Fence-San-Diego-Mexico-498688961.html\">Trump\u2019s wall</a>. They are not.</p> <p>The length of wall that has been built by Trump since he entered the White House in January 2017 is zero.</p> <p>This is the westernmost point of the US-Mexico border, on the outskirts of San Ysidro, California, a suburb of San Diego that is home to one of the busiest border crossings in the world. Here, the hopes of thousands of migrants who try to make it to the US every year are often dashed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/trump_border_wall/giv-3902GFI8W3eG4K1u/\" data-alt=\"Map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/trump_border_wall/giv-3902GFI8W3eG4K1u/\">Map</a> </figure>  <p>The fence stretches out just to where the waves break, and reaches 15 or 20ft, not the looming 30ft the president has demanded.</p> <p>Adjacent to this stretch of fence is Friendship Park, a patch of bi-national ground where loved ones from both sides of the border are allowed to meet. The name is paradoxical given the hostility Trump has engendered since he began his wall obsession.</p> <p>Outside Friendship Park \u2013 which only takes 10 visitors at a time \u2013 separated families and friends must make do with waving at each other from a distance. Today the US side is unpopulated save for a lone American, and on the Mexican side a father and young boy are looking northwards. \u201cUSA!\u201d the man says, pointing through a slot for his son\u2019s benefit.</p> <p>From San Ysidro, the fence extends for 46 of the next 60 miles of border before finally giving way way to the unforgiving desert. That\u2019s 46 out of a total of 654 miles of fencing that already exists, much of it in various stages of disrepair.</p> <p>Those hundreds of miles of double reinforced fencing and wire meshing were the product of a different era in politics where some degree of bipartisan consensus was possible. They were largely funded by the Secure Fence Act, an immigration compromise reached in 2006 under former president George W Bush.</p> <p>Compromise seems unthinkable these days. Trump has laid out a vision of the border that is harshly binary: on his side of the territorial line there is the rule of law, hard work and freedom; on the other side there is criminality, gangs and drug smuggling.</p> <p>The purpose of the wall, in Trump\u2019s dystopia, is to prevent America being overrun by the dark forces billowing out of its neighbor. In his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/08/donald-trump-speech-tv-address-border-wall-oval-office\">Oval Office address</a> to the nation last week he said: \u201cOver the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we don\u2019t act right now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a41d9c8b33f6a8b32a1993ecdc5c87a99e07d17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a41d9c8b33f6a8b32a1993ecdc5c87a99e07d17/0_0_2000_1333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump has laid out a binary vision: the rule of law versus criminality, gangs and drug smuggling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump has laid out a binary vision: the rule of law versus criminality, gangs and drug smuggling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But talk to people in San Ysidro on the American side of the border, and they will tell you about fear and intimidation inflicted on them by the US government.</p> <p>In this town, where 90% of residents speak Spanish at home, the land south of the border is not equated with lawlessness and evil, but with family, friends and affordable healthcare. If there\u2019s a dystopia, its not the Mexican one of Trump\u2019s imagining but the hardened militarism that is fast emerging on the US side replete with helicopters, barricades and armed border patrol.</p> <p>\u201cThe feeling like you\u2019re in a war zone is so dramatic the last couple months,\u201d said Lisa Cuestas, head of Casa Familiar, a non-profit that provides social services to San Ysidro.</p> <p>Militarization sped up after the arrival in Tijuana, on the Mexican side, of the caravan of Central American migrants which Trump made so much of during the November midterm elections, calling it an \u201cimmigration invasion\u201d. Now members of the caravan are stuck in Mexico and barbed wire has proliferated everywhere like a mutant weed.</p> <p>Estrella Flores has family and a job in San Ysidro, working with youth at Casa Familiar, but she lives in Tijuana with her husband and 18-month-old child. Her commute has become hellish since Trump\u2019s border crackdown.</p> <p>\u201cThe first time I went across the border where they had the barricades and the barbed wire and the helicopters I was like: \u2018Am I in a war zone? What\u2019s going on here? I\u2019m just trying to get to work.\u2019 This isn\u2019t just a friendly crossing, it could turn very bad, very quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Such views are commonplace across California. A poll conducted by the <a href=\"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/us-politics/sd-me-trump-poll-react-20190109-story.html\">San Diego Union-Tribune</a> after Trump\u2019s Oval Office speech found that 56% of Californians opposed the idea of the wall, compared with 34% in favor.</p> <p>That\u2019s not surprising for a state that is a leading force of progressive politics in the US. But California is also significant for having more <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/interactives/unauthorized-immigrants/\">undocumented migrants</a> than any other state \u2013 2.4 million to Texas\u2019s 1.7 million.</p> <p>Close by is the site of Trump\u2019s eight wall prototypes. He came here last March to pose for photos in front of the giant slabs of concrete and steel. Now they languish and rust.</p> <p>According to a later <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/693488.pdf\">report</a> by the Government Accountability Office, the eight model sections were riddled with design and construction flaws. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tested the slabs and found they can <a href=\"https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Some-Border-Wall-Prototypes-Able-to-be-Breached-CBP-Report-493659921.html\">be breached</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4a2166a872197906cb7ea13453380ef55ddadc42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a2166a872197906cb7ea13453380ef55ddadc42/0_0_5367_3578/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Cabeza Prieta wilderness near Ajo, Arizona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Cabeza Prieta wilderness near Ajo, Arizona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caitlin O\u2019Hara/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Death in the desert</strong></h2> <p>The first light glistens off the frosted spines of the cholla cacti as 30 volunteers in neon yellow shirts fan out to comb the desert under a pale pink sky.

Over the past two months, the US military have brought with them concertina wire and a double stack of shipping containers, ready to be used to block the entry as an impenetrable barricade should another caravan \u2013 or \u201cimmigrant invasion\u201d<strong> \u2013</strong> arise.</p> <p>Not that there\u2019s any sign of that.

As Josiah Heyman, director of the Center for Inter-American and Border Studies, put it: \u201cEl Paso is a place where there is a vision of the future, where people, instead of being part of a closed defensive community, are able to find the joy of relating to others.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6710a76b67019a391cfae303f65104a95d4afff7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6710a76b67019a391cfae303f65104a95d4afff7/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People cool off in the Rio Grande, just over the border from Laredo, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People cool off in the Rio Grande, just over the border from Laredo, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rodrigo Abd/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>On the edge \u2013 the Rio Grande</strong></h2> <p>Travel 40 miles east from El Paso along the Rio Grande to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/24/carols-tornillo-protesters-sing-migrant-children-trump-tent-city\">Tornillo</a>, and it feels a world away from the big city. Vast open areas are filled with orchards, and pecan nut and dairy farms.</p> <p>US border patrol vehicles keep a watchful eye.</p> <p>Of the 1,317 miles of border with no fence or human barrier, much of it lies along the 1,248 miles of Rio Grande. The river serves as the demarcation line between the two countries all the way from El Paso to the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>Powerful currents, towering canyons and cliffs that in the Big Bend section rise to 50ft reduce the need for a solid barrier through much of the river\u2019s trajectory.</p> <p>Still, Trump has his eye on the Rio Grande for his wall. Of the $5.7bn he is demanding from Congress, a sizable chunk would go towards building more than 100 miles of wall along the river.</p> <p>Here just outside Tornillo, the existing fence that runs west to Sunland Park in New Mexico has a 10-mile gap in it. Despite the lack of an artificial barrier, most locals go about their daily routine without fuss.</p> <p>Miguel Alvarez, who has lived close to the border for 25 years, said the arrival of the fence has made precious little difference. \u201cYou still see small groups of people passing through just like they did before any fencing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A farmer who didn\u2019t want to reveal his name said he would feel more comfortable if the gap in the fencing were closed. \u201cI haven\u2019t had any issues with people coming across, but you never know,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Tornillo itself fell under the national spotlight after the Trump administration chose the Marcelino Serna port of entry south of the town to house thousands of unaccompanied minors in a tent-like facility.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d has become the trademark of his presidency. It is the promise that more than any other has energized his base, and riled his opponents, and his dogged attachment to it has now brought a large part of the US government to a historic 25 days of partial shutdown. The potency of Trump\u2019s wall \u2013 for his supporters and his detractors \u2013 stems from its simplicity. Build it tall, build it wide \u2013 he has pledged 1,000 miles of it \u2013 and America will be safe again. But how does that uncomplicated notion compare to the complexity of the border itself? Taken as a whole, the 1,954 miles of US-Mexican border is a place of astounding diversity \u2013 of terrain, of land use, of city and countryside, of ethnicity. It traverses desert, river, mountain and sea. There is diversity, too, of political view among the 7.5 million people who live in US border counties. Some are ardent backers of Trump\u2019s wall. Others see their future, and the future of America, as being inextricably linked to that of their neighbor to the south. Friendship through the fence Hike 45 minutes past salt marshes and sand dunes, down a lonely beach empty but for occasional tourists on horseback, and you arrive at a steel fence that juts out into the Pacific Ocean. This is where Trump would like to start building his wall should he find the billions of dollars necessary. With the impasse over funding, which prompted the shutdown, administration officials have started to describe what\u2019s already here, as well as repairs to a two-mile stretch of fence in Calexico 100 miles to the east, as Trump\u2019s wall. They are not. The length of wall that has been built by Trump since he entered the White House in January 2017 is zero. This is the westernmost point of the US-Mexico border, on the outskirts of San Ysidro, California, a suburb of San Diego that is home to one of the busiest border crossings in the world. Here, the hopes of thousands of migrants who try to make it to the US every year are often dashed. The fence stretches out just to where the waves break, and reaches 15 or 20ft, not the looming 30ft the president has demanded. Adjacent to this stretch of fence is Friendship Park, a patch of bi-national ground where loved ones from both sides of the border are allowed to meet. The name is paradoxical given the hostility Trump has engendered since he began his wall obsession. Outside Friendship Park \u2013 which only takes 10 visitors at a time \u2013 separated families and friends must make do with waving at each other from a distance. Today the US side is unpopulated save for a lone American, and on the Mexican side a father and young boy are looking northwards. \u201cUSA!\u201d the man says, pointing through a slot for his son\u2019s benefit. From San Ysidro, the fence extends for 46 of the next 60 miles of border before finally giving way way to the unforgiving desert. That\u2019s 46 out of a total of 654 miles of fencing that already exists, much of it in various stages of disrepair. Those hundreds of miles of double reinforced fencing and wire meshing were the product of a different era in politics where some degree of bipartisan consensus was possible. They were largely funded by the Secure Fence Act, an immigration compromise reached in 2006 under former president George W Bush. Compromise seems unthinkable these days. Trump has laid out a vision of the border that is harshly binary: on his side of the territorial line there is the rule of law, hard work and freedom; on the other side there is criminality, gangs and drug smuggling. The purpose of the wall, in Trump\u2019s dystopia, is to prevent America being overrun by the dark forces billowing out of its neighbor. In his Oval Office address to the nation last week he said: \u201cOver the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we don\u2019t act right now.\u201d But talk to people in San Ysidro on the American side of the border, and they will tell you about fear and intimidation inflicted on them by the US government. In this town, where 90% of residents speak Spanish at home, the land south of the border is not equated with lawlessness and evil, but with family, friends and affordable healthcare. If there\u2019s a dystopia, its not the Mexican one of Trump\u2019s imagining but the hardened militarism that is fast emerging on the US side replete with helicopters, barricades and armed border patrol. \u201cThe feeling like you\u2019re in a war zone is so dramatic the last couple months,\u201d said Lisa Cuestas, head of Casa Familiar, a non-profit that provides social services to San Ysidro. Militarization sped up after the arrival in Tijuana, on the Mexican side, of the caravan of Central American migrants which Trump made so much of during the November midterm elections, calling it an \u201cimmigration invasion\u201d. Now members of the caravan are stuck in Mexico and barbed wire has proliferated everywhere like a mutant weed. Estrella Flores has family and a job in San Ysidro, working with youth at Casa Familiar, but she lives in Tijuana with her husband and 18-month-old child. Her commute has become hellish since Trump\u2019s border crackdown. \u201cThe first time I went across the border where they had the barricades and the barbed wire and the helicopters I was like: \u2018Am I in a war zone? What\u2019s going on here? I\u2019m just trying to get to work.\u2019 This isn\u2019t just a friendly crossing, it could turn very bad, very quickly.\u201d Such views are commonplace across California. A poll conducted by the San Diego Union-Tribune after Trump\u2019s Oval Office speech found that 56% of Californians opposed the idea of the wall, compared with 34% in favor. That\u2019s not surprising for a state that is a leading force of progressive politics in the US. But California is also significant for having more undocumented migrants than any other state \u2013 2.4 million to Texas\u2019s 1.7 million. Close by is the site of Trump\u2019s eight wall prototypes. He came here last March to pose for photos in front of the giant slabs of concrete and steel. Now they languish and rust. According to a later report by the Government Accountability Office, the eight model sections were riddled with design and construction flaws. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tested the slabs and found they can be breached. Death in the desert The first light glistens off the frosted spines of the cholla cacti as 30 volunteers in neon yellow shirts fan out to comb the desert under a pale pink sky. Ely Ortiz, the leader of the \u00c1guilas del desierto (Eagles of the desert) rallies his team who have driven through the night from San Diego to Ajo, Arizona. He tells them the last time they searched this area they found 11 sets of remains. The volunteers are joined by a team of cadaver dogs to help in the grim search. A dog called Zabra, whose last job was looking for victims of the California wildfires, is unaccustomed to the desert terrain and has to stop every couple of hundred yards to have barbed spines yanked from her paws. Unexploded ordnance dropped by the US military in training is one element of danger for migrants. Trump can already count on a metaphorical wall here. This is the most frequently travelled, but also most deadly, migrant corridor across the Sonoran desert. Water is scarce and temperatures rise above 120F (49C) in the summer months. The official CBP count records 7,209 deaths along the south-western border in the past 20 years, but that is almost certainly a gross underestimate. Despite the human tragedy, federal prosecutors have seen fit to prosecute nine volunteers with the humanitarian group No More Deaths. Their offence: \u201clittering\u201d and driving on restricted roads in the Cabeza Prieta reserve when responding to search and rescue calls. The nine will face trial on Tuesday in a federal district court in Tucson. \u201cThe irony is that they tell us we can\u2019t drive here or leave water because it\u2019s protected wilderness, but meanwhile border patrol drives their trucks and ATVs off road, and fly helicopters and drones wherever they want,\u201d one of the nine, Parker Deighan, told the Guardian. Trump\u2019s policy of \u201cprevention through deterrence\u201d is forcing migrants to take greater risks. As legal admission to the US through official ports of entry becomes ever more restricted, migrants are being \u201cfunneled\u201d away from fenced sections of the border towards the desert. One of the only towns in the area is Ajo. Today it\u2019s a ghost town, as its copper mine closed in the 1980s. Since then most residents have switched to the main local job-provider: border security. Ajo Samaritans recently gathered in the plaza for a vigil to honor the lives of the people who succumbed in the surrounding wilderness. They laid out 118 white crosses, one for each of those lost in 2018. Those whose bones had yet to be identified were called desconocido \u2013 unknown. Making an entry Before Trump decided to throw a bone to his voter base during the midterm election campaign last year by sending more than 5,000 active-duty military troops to the border, the gate at Lukeville port of entry in Arizona was almost always open. American tourists, seeking to flee the winter, would blithely pour through heading for the beach at Rocky Point, an hour\u2019s drive south on the Mexican coast. Trump\u2019s border clampdown hasn\u2019t only cramped the style of beach-lovers as they pass through the now half-closed gate. Over the past two months, the US military have brought with them concertina wire and a double stack of shipping containers, ready to be used to block the entry as an impenetrable barricade should another caravan \u2013 or \u201cimmigrant invasion\u201d \u2013 arise. Not that there\u2019s any sign of that. Most of the traffic through Lukeville is commercial and passenger, and the main concern of federal agents is not migrants but drugs. It is one of the myths propagated by the Trump administration that America is awash with drugs that have flooded into the country through lack of a wall. In his Oval Office address last week, Trump said that \u201cthe border wall would very quickly pay for itself\u201d by halting the flow of illicit drugs \u2013 implying that narcotics came into the US through sections of open border. Not true. In fact, most illegal drugs are hidden away in cars and tractor-trailers as they pass over international bridges and through small ports of entry like Lukeville. The 2018 annual drug threat assessment of the Drug Enforcement Administration points out that for drugs like heroin, up to 90% enters the country through ports of entry. Another contradiction is that Trump insists on immigrants showing up legally at border crossings, yet for those who do so he has made it increasingly difficult for them to claim asylum. In November the Trump administration announced it would deny asylum to anyone who tries to cross the border illegally, though a federal court has since temporarily blocked the new regulation. Meanwhile, a new system of \u201cmetering\u201d has been introduced that amounts to a federal slowdown at legal entry points. As a result, growing numbers of increasingly desperate families, most coming from the trio of violence-ridden Central American countries \u2013 Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala \u2013 have been left stranded in Mexico. At Lukeville, asylum seekers following Trump\u2019s orders and showing up legally at the port of entry have simply been turned away. The Guardian spoke to Alberto (not his real name) in a shelter on the Mexican side. In November, he presented himself at Lukeville and asked for asylum. The supervising agent there told him to leave, claiming it was out of hours. Alberto was left on the streets where, days before, mafia members had told him they would kill him if they saw him again. Volunteer groups working with immigrants protested, and CBP apologized. Now when asked if they accept claims, Lukeville agents repeat the official mantra: \u201cAsylum seekers are being accepted at all ports of entry.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean claims will be successful. Alberto did try a second time to have his claim heard. He will testify before an immigration judge in two weeks\u2019 time. The twin city There is no place along the border that more strongly rebuts Trump\u2019s dystopian vision than El Paso. The Texas city is so intertwined with Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez across the Rio Grande to the south that they are virtually inseparable. Between them they are home to almost 3 million people \u2013 roughly the size of Chicago. About 20,000 pedestrians and more than 35,000 vehicles cross into El Paso from Mexico every day, many to work, others to go to school or shop. It\u2019s two-way traffic: Americans in El Paso also regularly cross into Ju\u00e1rez to visit family or experience the nightlife. Eighty per cent of El Paso\u2019s residents are of Hispanic origin, and a quarter of the city\u2019s population was born outside the US. Mary Gonzalez, the Democratic representative for El Paso in the Texas house, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a very generous, diverse, multinational, welcoming and loving community. That human component is left out when the border is discussed.\u201d Retail sales in the US side of the twin cities are estimated to generate $10bn a year, with a fifth attributed to Mexican shoppers. Against that reality, Trump has painted a picture of rampant crime and the threat of violence being imported into the US. That\u2019s a particularly loaded argument for El Paso, given the historically high murder rate in neighboring Ju\u00e1rez. Last year saw it rise again to almost 200 people killed each month. Yet crime in El Paso on the US side of the border remains relatively low. Violent crimes have fallen sharply from about 6,500 in 1993 to around 3,000 today. That\u2019s why Beto O\u2019Rourke, the rising star of the Democratic party and former Congress representative for this strongly left-leaning city, lauded El Paso as the \u201csafest city in America\u201d as part of his senatorial election campaign in November. (His claim wasn\u2019t entirely accurate \u2013 factcheckers found it was only \u201chalf true\u201d.) O\u2019Rourke failed in his bid to unseat Ted Cruz in the midterm elections, but the fact that he came within three points of doing so suggests that Texans might be more open to his liberal stance on immigration and less in step with Trump than is often assumed. Opinion polls show that while most Texans are concerned about immigrants entering the country illegally, most are also opposed to Trump\u2019s wall. Some people go as far as to suggest that El Paso could be a harbinger of things to come for the whole of America. As Josiah Heyman, director of the Center for Inter-American and Border Studies, put it: \u201cEl Paso is a place where there is a vision of the future, where people, instead of being part of a closed defensive community, are able to find the joy of relating to others.\u201d On the edge \u2013 the Rio Grande Travel 40 miles east from El Paso along the Rio Grande to Tornillo, and it feels a world away from the big city. Vast open areas are filled with orchards, and pecan nut and dairy farms. US border patrol vehicles keep a watchful eye. Of the 1,317 miles of border with no fence or human barrier, much of it lies along the 1,248 miles of Rio Grande. The river serves as the demarcation line between the two countries all the way from El Paso to the Gulf of Mexico. Powerful currents, towering canyons and cliffs that in the Big Bend section rise to 50ft reduce the need for a solid barrier through much of the river\u2019s trajectory. Still, Trump has his eye on the Rio Grande for his wall. Of the $5.7bn he is demanding from Congress, a sizable chunk would go towards building more than 100 miles of wall along the river. Here just outside Tornillo, the existing fence that runs west to Sunland Park in New Mexico has a 10-mile gap in it. Despite the lack of an artificial barrier, most locals go about their daily routine without fuss. Miguel Alvarez, who has lived close to the border for 25 years, said the arrival of the fence has made precious little difference. \u201cYou still see small groups of people passing through just like they did before any fencing,\u201d he said. A farmer who didn\u2019t want to reveal his name said he would feel more comfortable if the gap in the fencing were closed. \u201cI haven\u2019t had any issues with people coming across, but you never know,\u201d he said. Tornillo itself fell under the national spotlight after the Trump administration chose the Marcelino Serna port of entry south of the town to house thousands of unaccompanied minors in a tent-like facility. It was meant to be temporary, designed to help deal with hundreds of children who had been separated from their families as a result of Trump\u2019s crackdown on border crossers. But it rapidly grew, to up to 2,400 beds, becoming the face of the brutality of Trump\u2019s policy of tearing families apart as a form of deterrent. In November, a government watchdog warned that conditions in the tent city were putting children at risk, and since then the numbers have been reduced until the last teenager was transferred out of the facility last week. As far as locals are concerned, its closure couldn\u2019t happen fast enough. They are eager for things to get back to normal. Or at least as close to what passes as normal these days. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 January 2019 because the fence is not unbroken for the 46 miles from San Ysidro to the desert, as an earlier version said.",

The move to relax new rules that were put in place by the Obama administration after the BP disaster, which killed 11 workers, spewed 4m barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, and cost BP $65bn, comes as the White House is seeking to open offshore oil and gas drilling to the vast majority of US coastal waters, including in the Arctic. The proposed revised rules, which most experts believe will be finalised despite heavy opposition from environmental groups, include a change that would allow oil companies to select third-party companies to evaluate the safety of their equipment. Under previous rules, those entities had to be approved by the government agency that oversees offshore drilling, without any input from industry.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s frenzied preoccupation with expanding the wall on the US-Mexico border that, two years into his presidency has yet to materialize, often eclipses the very real \u201cinvisible wall\u201d he has constructed to exclude immigrants. Trump has taken the extreme step of threatening to declare a national emergency if Democrats will not approve his $5.7bn demand for the project. At the same time, his administration has successfully made it more difficult for immigrants to enter the country to work, visit family and flee violence and poverty. As Trump continues to demand an expansion of the barrier with Mexico, rightwing anti-immigrant groups that advocate harsh restrictions on immigration , such as the Federation for American Immigration Reform (Fair), are looking back on two years of what they consider significant progress. At least six current and former advisers to Donald Trump, including Kellyanne Conway and Stephen Miller, have ties to Fair, which for decades has been working to drastically curb immigration. \u201cA lot of his [Trump\u2019s] accomplishments are more granular, more in the weeds, than build the wall,\u201d RJ Hauman, Fair\u2019s head lobbyist, told the Guardian. Last year, radical changes to US immigration policy included separating 2,654 migrant children from their parents at the border, slashing the refugee limit to a historic low of 30,000 people allowed to settle in the US, and adding a citizenship question to the population census, a move that is being challenged in court. These high-profile maneuvers happened in concert with many less headline-grabbing but key administrative changes to the legal immigration process. These toughened rules for immigrants and increased visa processing times, such as a proposal to make it more difficult for people to get green cards if they use public benefits. For groups such as Fair, these changes are exactly why Trump has been a success. \u201cThose legal immigration changes are just as important, or even more important, than building the wall right now and we wish they were more of a focus in this current negotiation,\u201d Hauman said. The Fairwebsite lists 10 campaign promises Trump made and information on whether or not he has completed them. As of this week, Trump had completed one promise: the travel ban, ordered days into his presidency, which was affirmed by the supreme court after being amended twice. Five of the other promises are in progress, three have been initiated and one has been stalled, according to the Fair website.

This would revoke more than 100,000 people\u2019s ability to work legally in the US, unless a court intervenes.

Since joining North Melbourne, Daw has become a key figure in the AFL and the wider community. Daw, who arrived in Australia with his family from war-torn Sudan in 2003, has spoken out against racism in his role as an AFL multicultural ambassador. He was selected by North Melbourne at the 2010 rookie draft and became the first Sudanese-born player to make an AFL debut when he played his first senior game against the Brisbane Lions in round four of the 2013 season.

The Victorian Game Management Authority said it had decided to end the duck season three weeks early, allowing shooters nine weeks instead of 12 to hunt, because \u201cprevailing and persistent dry conditions\u201d had reduced duck numbers. Bag limits have also been reduced to four per day on opening weekend, 16 and 17 March, and five per day thereafter. Hunting of blue-winged shoveler ducks is banned. It is the lowest opening day bag limit since 2009, which specified two birds with an additional three wood ducks, and the lowest season-long bag limit since 2015. South Australia has authorised a 15-week open season in 2019, running from 16 March to 30 June, with a bag limit of eight birds per day. In New South Wales, where 79% of the state is affected by drought, licensed hunters are allowed to shoot ducks year round provided they have the landowner\u2019s permission and don\u2019t exceed quotas. But water bird experts have suggested the season should be suspended to preserve the breeding populations, saying that mass fish kills in the Murray-Darling system are a sign animals that rely on that system are in trouble. The 2018 Aerial Survey of Wetland Birds in Eastern Australia showed long-term declines in the numbers of key game duck species, including the wood duck, Pacific black duck, chestnut teal and grey teal \u2013 although numbers of the last two species increased slightly in the past 12 months. The survey, which has been running since 1983, showed that overall waterbird numbers were approaching the low of the millennium drought, when Victoria suspended its duck hunting season from 2007 to 2008. \u201cMost game species abundances were well below long-term averages, in some cases by an order of magnitude,\u201d the report said. \u201cSix out of eight species continue to show significant long-term declines.\u201d Key breeding grounds, like the Menindee Lakes, were dry or nearly dry in 2018. Lead researcher Richard Kingsford said that the decline in waterbird numbers was directly linked to the drought and drying wetlands, and that without juvenile birds to shoot hunters risked killing the breeding stock. \u201cThere are always real dangers in having a season in these very dry years, and it\u2019s also a danger for duck hunters, because you can do some damage to the breeding adults and it lessens your population for future hunting,\u201d Kingsford told Guardian Australia. RSPCA Victoria and the Victorian Greens have both called for the season to be suspended due to lack of water and concern about low breeding numbers. Birdlife Australia spokesman Sean Dooley said bird populations were already under stress. \u201cAnywhere in Victoria that has water is going to be crucial for the future survival of water birds,\u201d he said. One of the few year-round protected habitats, the Werribee sewage ponds in western Melbourne, has just become home to a tufted duck native to northern Eurasia, to the delight of birdwatchers. That duck has flocked with game species, and if they move on into areas where hunting is allowed it would also be at risk, Dooley said. Because it has never been seen in Australia before, the tufted duck has no protected status. The GMA chief executive, Graeme Ford, said the authority had analysed available population data before recommending the shortened season. He said that while the data showed that \u201cgame duck abundance, breeding and habitat were reduced\u201d, it also showed they were more widely dispersed than usual and were therefore not \u201csubject to over harvesting pressure\u201d in Victoria. Hunters will also have to obey new rules to make all reasonable efforts to retrieve a game bird they have shot before shooting another bird, and to salvage at least the breast meat from every game bird they kill.",

In the weeks that followed, it was tweeted more than 12m times.</p> <p>I sent one of those 12m tweets, writing at the time how those simple words spoke to this sudden, Twitter-facilitated experience of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/17/as-a-young-powerless-woman-trapped-alone-with-a-predator-i-did-not-run\">collective deshaming</a>\u201d.</p> <p>What I recognise in the 18 months since is that the power of that revelation, and the visibility of the uprising, lay not just in the sense of shared relief. It also affirmed to me my right to individual validation.</p> <p>As a word, MeToo speaks to both sentiments. English rarely creates new words of its component parts \u2013 mashing a personal pronoun (me) into an adverb (too), a word that describes active commonality. As a word, it renders the individual indivisible from their shared experience.</p> <p>For survivors, appreciation of this conjunction has been visceral. After the Weinstein accusations, in a phone conversation with a colleague \u2013 who at the time I barely knew \u2013 devolved to a mutual series of repetitions of the phrase: me too, me too, me too \u2026 Less words than a chorus of earned and brutal yawps.</p> <p>The Macquarie panellists concur it\u2019s a word infused with a rare emotional power. For new words to enter the dictionary is often a long journey. Habitually, dictionary word-watchers observe this slow passage of neologisms from the smaller rooms of discourse \u2013 chatrooms, journals, subcultures, teenagers on buses \u2013 into speech; it\u2019s only by charting use and aggregating frequency through which lexicographers become convinced a new word will endure.</p> <p>Not so with MeToo, whose viral spread from Milano\u2019s tweets achieved rapid transition from hashtag to encyclopaedic record to dictionary with alacrity.</p> <p>Words enter languages because there is an imperative to name something that has made itself distinct, and the intensity of MeToo\u2019s uptake suggests just how desperately this word was needed; that there is a specific sorority within surviving sexual misconduct that the world has finally been obliged to describe.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, the <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/11/22/weinstein-aftermath-all-men-accused-sexual-misconduct/884778001/\">onset of consequences</a> from the revelations are unprecedented. Even in Australia, where strict defamation laws transform those accused of misconduct into plaintiffs, we have arrived on a fresh country of explicit complaint. To prevent suits, bad press or trouble, employers are scrambling for workplace safeguards: rehearsal rooms and film sets, for instance, are employing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/13/is-it-ok-for-me-to-touch-you-here-the-people-making-rehearsal-rooms-safe\">intimacy coordinators</a>, lest \u201che got metooed\u201d is said of the sudden disappearance of an inappropriately behaving, former employee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t see it stopping any time soon,\u201d Victoria Morgan, word-of-the-year judge and senior editor of the Macquarie, told me.

      "bodyText": "MeToo has received its fair recognition from Australia\u2019s Macquarie Dictionary, becoming its word of the year. That dictionary defines it as an adjective, describing a relation of or to \u201cthe Me Too movement \u2026 [or] an accusation of sexual harassment or sexual assault\u201d. It also has a meaning as a verb \u2013 the action of accusing \u201c(someone) of having committed sexual harassment or sexual assault\u201d \u2013 as in, \u201che has been MeTooed\u201d. Although the term now denotes a movement, it was conceived in 2006 as \u201ca kind of bat signal between survivors of sexual violence\u201d by Tarana Burke, who used it as the name of an activist group. Twelve years from Burke\u2019s inception \u2013 and 10 days after the New York Times exposed the sexual misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein in 2017 \u2013 actor Alyssa Milano tweeted it as a hashtag, rousing survivors to out themselves in solidarity. In the weeks that followed, it was tweeted more than 12m times. I sent one of those 12m tweets, writing at the time how those simple words spoke to this sudden, Twitter-facilitated experience of \u201ccollective deshaming\u201d. What I recognise in the 18 months since is that the power of that revelation, and the visibility of the uprising, lay not just in the sense of shared relief. It also affirmed to me my right to individual validation. As a word, MeToo speaks to both sentiments. English rarely creates new words of its component parts \u2013 mashing a personal pronoun (me) into an adverb (too), a word that describes active commonality. As a word, it renders the individual indivisible from their shared experience. For survivors, appreciation of this conjunction has been visceral. After the Weinstein accusations, in a phone conversation with a colleague \u2013 who at the time I barely knew \u2013 devolved to a mutual series of repetitions of the phrase: me too, me too, me too \u2026 Less words than a chorus of earned and brutal yawps. The Macquarie panellists concur it\u2019s a word infused with a rare emotional power. For new words to enter the dictionary is often a long journey. Habitually, dictionary word-watchers observe this slow passage of neologisms from the smaller rooms of discourse \u2013 chatrooms, journals, subcultures, teenagers on buses \u2013 into speech; it\u2019s only by charting use and aggregating frequency through which lexicographers become convinced a new word will endure. Not so with MeToo, whose viral spread from Milano\u2019s tweets achieved rapid transition from hashtag to encyclopaedic record to dictionary with alacrity. Words enter languages because there is an imperative to name something that has made itself distinct, and the intensity of MeToo\u2019s uptake suggests just how desperately this word was needed; that there is a specific sorority within surviving sexual misconduct that the world has finally been obliged to describe. What\u2019s more, the onset of consequences from the revelations are unprecedented. Even in Australia, where strict defamation laws transform those accused of misconduct into plaintiffs, we have arrived on a fresh country of explicit complaint. To prevent suits, bad press or trouble, employers are scrambling for workplace safeguards: rehearsal rooms and film sets, for instance, are employing intimacy coordinators, lest \u201che got metooed\u201d is said of the sudden disappearance of an inappropriately behaving, former employee. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cI can\u2019t see it stopping any time soon,\u201d Victoria Morgan, word-of-the-year judge and senior editor of the Macquarie, told me. It should give all women confidence that a revolution is upon us, even if its future is unclear. \u201cIt was so overwhelming when we looked at it to the others in comparison.\u201d There is grim amusement, also, in the discovery that MeToo\u2019s word of the year competitors included the patriarchal \u201cincel\u201d, which describes the woman-hating, \u201cinvoluntary celibates\u201d of the Manosphere, as well as the frightful \u201cBig Dick Energy\u201d \u2013 which, alas, demands no explanation. \u201cIncel was a strong contender, but Metoo was overwhelming,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWhen people take it upon themselves to bring [a new term] into language, it really highlights how great the need for it in language is. The committee was unified behind the decision,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cIt has become an identifier.\u201d There are millions of us \u2013 already \u2013 who know precisely what it means.",

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales government will install aerators at various sites across the state amid fears of more fish kills as temperatures soar above 40C in the Murray-Darling Basin. A new fish kill event at Lake Hume was downgraded to 60 dead fish from 1,800 after authorities from the Department of Primary Industries arrived to investigate. The office of primary industries minister, Niall Blair, on Tuesday initially suggested some 1,800 fish had died in Lake Hume, which is part of the Murray River system. But his department subsequently said an investigation had found \u201capproximately 60 dead carp were located in the water\u201d near a boat ramp. \u201cA cause of the fish kill has not yet been determined, however, there are no algal or dissolved oxygen issues noticeable,\u201d the DPI said in a statement. \u201cFishing mortality is one potential cause.\u201d Fears of more fish kills came as temperatures soared above 40C in the Murray-Darling basin and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) convened an urgent meeting of experts to discuss what can be done to alleviate conditions in the river system. It follows an incident last week in which more than 1 million fish were reported to have died at Menindee Lakes, including 70-year-old Murray cod, which are listed under commonwealth law as a vulnerable species. On Tuesday, Blair visited Lake Keepit near Tamworth, the site of another major fish kill two weeks ago, to announce plans to install the aerators. The aeration technology will be installed at Menindee Lakes on Wednesday, Lake Keepit on Thursday and at Lake Burrendong next week. \u201cAeration is not a silver bullet solution but it does provide localised areas where fish can get more oxygen, which ultimately gives them a better chance of surviving,\u201d Blair said. The solar-powered aerators will run at night when rivers are at most risk of suffering oxygen depletion. \u201cUnfortunately the conditions we\u2019ve seen across NSW are leading to more and more fish kills, which are caused by algae blooms, black water and oxygen depletion from Port Macquarie and Lake Burrendong to Keepit and Menindee,\u201d he said. Speaking after Tuesday\u2019s meeting, Phillip Glyde, the chief executive of the MDBA, said authorities had been working hard over the last decade to repair the damage wrought from 100 years of over-allocation of water in the Murray-Darling river basin. He defended the management of the system, particularly the decision by authorities to draw water from Menindee Lakes ahead of other catchment areas. It made sense to draw water from Menindee Lakes ahead of the Dartmouth and Hume dams, he said, because those dams don\u2019t have the high evaporation rates of the Menindee Lakes. He said the NSW government\u2019s decision to begin installing aerators would only have a limited impact. Glyde said all options were being considered to save current fish stocks, including relocating Murray cod to areas of the river system that were not as stressed. However, the likelihood such a scheme being successful was low. He said he did not know where the figure of \u201cone million\u201d dead fish came from, because nobody had counted them yet. Appearing on the ABC on Tuesday, he said climate change was making it more difficult to manage the system. \u201cWe know the climate is changing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has equal impact on irrigators as well as environmental water holders. We can\u2019t predict precisely where those impacts might be.

A recent tour took in the site of Eden, the hotel where Luxemburg and Liebknecht were brought by demobilised former soldiers, known as <em>Freikorps</em> to be beaten and shot. It continues to the location where Luxemburg\u2019s body was thrown into the canal, and, a few hundred metres away, the Neuen See lake where Liebknecht was shot and killed.</p> <p>When the Freikorps came to arrest her, Luxemburg was reading Goethe\u2019s Faust. \u201cShe thought she was going to be taken to prison, she had no idea she was going to be murdered, so she brought a suitcase of books with her,\u201d Hiksch said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f66a02f6c5a575e71e9a6a0477f71acad787169e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f66a02f6c5a575e71e9a6a0477f71acad787169e/0_154_1279_767/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rosa Luxemburg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rosa Luxemburg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Far from uniting Germany\u2019s left, the murders created a deep divide, still felt keenly today in the animosities that exist between the Social Democratic party (SPD), the junior coalition partner to Angela Merkel\u2019s centre-right Christian Democrats, and Die Linke, successors to the communist party that ruled East Germany.</p> <p>Recently, Andrea Nahles became the first leader of the SPD to come close to admitting her party\u2019s role in the revolutionaries\u2019 deaths, amid evidence that Gustav Noske, the minister of defence in the SPD-led fledgling Weimar government at the time, effectively signed off on the murders in an effort to crush the far left.</p> <p>\u201cIt is probable that Gustav Noske had a hand in the murders of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht,\u201d she told the party faithful in November at an event to discuss the 1919 revolt.</p> <p>Noske was later involved in the farcical trials that followed the murders and that led to the acquittal of all but two of the suspects, who received paltry sentences.</p> <p>\u201cThe SPD has a very difficult relationship with the 1918-19 revolution,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWhile various party historians openly admit the SPD\u2019s role in the events, others still want to defend it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebba8be90f32b4ae232d90a2d161ee84c9ca1c13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebba8be90f32b4ae232d90a2d161ee84c9ca1c13/0_138_3799_2280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karl Liebknecht speaking at a peace rally in Berlin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karl Liebknecht speaking at a peace rally in Berlin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ullstein bild Dtl./ullstein bild via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even now, he said, Die Linke supporters argued that just as the SPD betrayed the working class then, so it continued to do with its labour reforms, seen as punishing the working class.</p> <p>The London writer David Fernbach was among those who came to Berlin to pay tribute to Luxemburg and Liebknecht.

Luxemburg\u2019s slogans, along with portraits of her and Liebknecht, were held high on the red banners clutched by people as they made their way along the former Stalin Allee in eastern Berlin on Sunday, with hearty renditions of the Internationale and other revolutionary songs blaring out of portable speakers. \u201cOf course, the brutal and sudden end to her story raises the question of what would have happened if she had survived,\u201d said Jones. \u201cAt its most advanced and powerful, the Rosa Luxemburg myth claims that had she lived, National Socialism may have never taken control of Germany.\u201d That was a view held by many at the demonstration. \u201cI do believe the Nazis might not have come to power and history might well have taken a different turn had Rosa been able to fulfil her wishes,\u201d said Kit Aastrup, a retired social worker who had taken a bus from Aarhus in Denmark to join the march. She wore a Russian ushanka ear-flap hat, embossed with a hammer and sickle. A group calling themselves the \u201cYellow Vests\u201d, a nod to France\u2019s gilet jaunes movement, held a banner across the width of the street that read: \u201cRemembering Karl and Rosa in 2019 means showing solidarity with the \u2018yellow vests\u2019.\u201d On the sidelines, a team from the British communist newspaper Morning Star was doing a roaring trade. \u201cRed Rosa, the communist eagle,\u201d ran the headline on its inside feature story on Luxemburg, referring to the affectionate title Lenin gave to the German communist. The article concludes: \u201cEven after 100 years [her] memory still soars like an eagle to inspire revolutionary socialists all over the world.\u201d The Luxemburg tour Uwe Hiksch, a member of the opposition Die Linke, or Left party, which sees itself as the natural inheritor of Luxemburg\u2019s legacy, guides tourists around the Berlin landmarks connected to the murders. A recent tour took in the site of Eden, the hotel where Luxemburg and Liebknecht were brought by demobilised former soldiers, known as Freikorps to be beaten and shot. It continues to the location where Luxemburg\u2019s body was thrown into the canal, and, a few hundred metres away, the Neuen See lake where Liebknecht was shot and killed. When the Freikorps came to arrest her, Luxemburg was reading Goethe\u2019s Faust. \u201cShe thought she was going to be taken to prison, she had no idea she was going to be murdered, so she brought a suitcase of books with her,\u201d Hiksch said. Far from uniting Germany\u2019s left, the murders created a deep divide, still felt keenly today in the animosities that exist between the Social Democratic party (SPD), the junior coalition partner to Angela Merkel\u2019s centre-right Christian Democrats, and Die Linke, successors to the communist party that ruled East Germany. Recently, Andrea Nahles became the first leader of the SPD to come close to admitting her party\u2019s role in the revolutionaries\u2019 deaths, amid evidence that Gustav Noske, the minister of defence in the SPD-led fledgling Weimar government at the time, effectively signed off on the murders in an effort to crush the far left. \u201cIt is probable that Gustav Noske had a hand in the murders of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht,\u201d she told the party faithful in November at an event to discuss the 1919 revolt. Noske was later involved in the farcical trials that followed the murders and that led to the acquittal of all but two of the suspects, who received paltry sentences. \u201cThe SPD has a very difficult relationship with the 1918-19 revolution,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWhile various party historians openly admit the SPD\u2019s role in the events, others still want to defend it.\u201d Even now, he said, Die Linke supporters argued that just as the SPD betrayed the working class then, so it continued to do with its labour reforms, seen as punishing the working class. The London writer David Fernbach was among those who came to Berlin to pay tribute to Luxemburg and Liebknecht. His grandfather, Wolfgang, was a member of the Spartacus League, the Marxist revolutionary movement founded by Luxemburg and Liebknecht in reaction to the SPD\u2019s support for the first world war. Wolfgang was murdered by government troops on 11 January 1919, when he was 30. \u201cLuxemburg made a huge contribution to the positive sides of German socialism at a time when it was free from the dogmatisms that were to follow, which is why I think she remains something of an untainted socialist icon today,\u201d Fernbach said.",

But the interim report, released on Tuesday, could not make \u201cdefinitive conclusions\u201d about what precisely caused the damage in the new apartment building, which developed a dramatic crack on Christmas Eve. One of the authors, Prof Mark Hoffman from the University of NSW, said residents should not move back in until new repairs and checks were completed, which would \u201cstretch over many weeks\u201d. He said \u201csignificant rectification works\u201d were needed that would turn the building \u201ceffectively into a construction site\u201d. The report found the building was structurally sound and not in danger of collapsing, but had many construction defects. Two hob beams had \u201csafety [standards] lower than required by standards\u201d, a dowel bar between a hob beam and a panel \u201cwas observed to be incomplete\u201d, precast concrete panels were found to be 200mm wide, instead of 180mm, and a series of reinforcing bars were found to be 20mm, instead of 28mm. Asked if these were significant faults, Hoffman said it was too early to tell. The report concluded that engineers needed more information to make definitive conclusions about the cause or causes of the damage. The NSW planning minister, Anthony Roberts, said he wanted to \u201cmake very clear this is an interim report\u201d and more reports would follow. He said the question of whether residents should re-enter their homes was \u201cbeyond the scope\u201d of the report, but Hoffman said he would recommend residents wait. On Friday the company that built the tower, Icon Co, declared it was safe for residents to return home over the weekend. But the chairman of the body corporate, Shady Eskander, said residents overwhelmingly refused to move back. \u201cA meeting was held last Saturday, 300-plus owners of the site attended,\u201d he said. \u201cOverwhelmingly we will not return to the site \u2026 until independent engineers have said on letterhead that it is safe to move in. \u201cNo resident wants to live on a construction site.

The former member for Lyne \u2013 who helped install Julia Gillard into government in 2010 - challenged for the seat of Cowper in the 2016 election after his home town of Port Macquarie moved in an electoral boundary redistribution. Oakeshott fell short, winning 26% of the primary vote and 45% in two-party preferred terms. His decision to re-contest is bad news for the Morrison government, which is hoping to hold the seat in the face of Hartsuyker\u2019s decision to retire at the election and a rising tide of rural independent candidates urging a protest vote against the Nationals. \u201cI\u2019ve obviously thought long and hard about this decision and go into it eyes wide open,\u201d Oakeshott said in a video on social media. \u201cIf I don\u2019t stand, nothing happens in our local area because nothing changes politically.\u201d Oakeshott was silent on the point of whether he expected to win the seat, but said \u201ccompetition is a wonderful thing in politics\u201d that would help the local area \u201cput pressure on politicians to get the results we deserve\u201d. \u201cWe are no longer forgotten if I do stand as a candidate,\u201d Oakeshott said. He singled out the Coffs Harbour bypass and a Port Macquarie aquatic centre as examples of projects on a long list that were well overdue and not getting the attention they deserved. In 2010, Oakeshott, along with Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie and NSW independent MP Tony Windsor, were kingmakers for the Gillard minority government. He retired from politics at the 2013 election because he said he was exhausted from the demands of the hung parliament. The father of four has been working in recent years as a consultant for the United Nations Development Program and doing advisory work with the Myanmar, Solomon Islands, Cook Islands, Fiji and Vanuatu governments. Oakeshott\u2019s 2016 bid for Cowper helped him net $71,477 of public funding from the Australian Electoral Commission.",

Taylor has brushed off the complaint, saying that he contracted to sell his shares in the Sydney-based recruitment company Derwent Executive in January 2016, months before the nomination date for the 2016 election. But at a press conference on Tuesday, the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said that Taylor\u2019s eligibility was \u201cunder a cloud\u201d because that account was \u201cinconsistent\u201d with what Taylor had declared on the members\u2019 register of interests and Derwent\u2019s disclosure to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. In a declaration stamped 27 September 2016, Taylor stated that he and his wife owned shares in Derwent Recruitment Associates and Derwent Executive International. According to a report in the Australian, the talent advisory firm had a $30,000 contract from March to July 2016 with the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority, and had won federal government contracts worth $500,000 since late 2016. Section 44 of the constitution prohibits MPs from having \u201cany direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the public service of the commonwealth\u201d. Constitutional expert Anne Twomey reportedly said if Taylor held shares on or after he nominated for the election on 7 June 2016, and the company had any agreements with the public service, \u201cthere was a reasonable likelihood that the court of disputed returns would find that he was not validly elected\u201d. However, it is unclear if the Acara contract could be a disqualification because Acara is an independent statutory body, albeit one that receives federal funding. A spokesman for Taylor said: \u201cMr Taylor\u2019s interest in Derwent ceased by contract with [company founder] Ben Derwent in January 2016. Mr Taylor has had no relevant interest in the company since that time.\u201d Derwent reportedly backed that account, telling the Australian Taylor\u2019s interest in the company ceased in January 2016. Despite submitting on 23 September 2016 that there were no changes to his register of interests, on 21 March 2017 Taylor updated the register, deleting his Derwent Executive shareholding, which he said had been \u201csold to [the] founder\u201d. In declarations by Derwent to Asic on 29 November 2016, the company said the Taylor family company, Gufee Pty Ltd, ceased to hold the shares on 2 July 2016, the date of the federal election. Dreyfus told reporters in Melbourne that it \u201cit appears [Taylor] still held the shares at the time of the last election, which would put his eligibility to sit in parliament in doubt\u201d. Dreyfus accused Taylor of \u201crefusing to make clear exactly when he sold those shares\u201d. \u201cMr Taylor has not provided any proof at all he sold the shares at an earlier time.\u201d In 2018, Labor questioned the eligibility of Peter Dutton on the basis of his interests in childcare centres but a move to refer the home affairs minister to the high court stalled when it failed to win enough votes on the crossbench. Legal advice from the solicitor general concluded Dutton was \u201cnot incapable\u201d of sitting as a member of parliament but there was still \u201csome risk\u201d the high court might find he had a conflict of interest. Without a referral from parliament it is unlikely Taylor\u2019s case will ever be tested, because if he is re-elected in 2019 after disposing of his shares the earlier potential disqualification cannot be raised. Dreyfus said the prime minister, Scott Morrison, should \u201cstep in and put this matter beyond doubt\u201d by referring all ministers whose eligibility is in question to the high court.",

      "bodyText": "House Republicans formally stripped Representative Steve King of all committee assignments on Monday night, days after the Iowa Republican drew criticism for yet another controversial and racially charged comment. In an interview with the New York Times published last week, King rhetorically said \u201cwhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\u201d The Iowa Republican has long been a lightning rod within his own party, making controversial comments, particularly on Twitter. King endorsed a white nationalist candidate for Toronto mayor, tweeted in support of far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders saying \u201cwe can\u2019t restore our civilization with somebody else\u2019s babies,\u201d compared immigrants to dirt and used rhetoric common to the alt-right in an interview with a magazine affiliated with the far-right Austrian Freedom party. King\u2019s conduct drew condemnation from Steve Stivers, the head of the National Republican Campaign Committee, only days before the 2018 midterms. \u201cCongressman Steve King\u2019s recent comments, actions, and retweets are completely inappropriate. We must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms, and I strongly condemn this behavior,\u201d said the Ohio Republican in a tweet. However, King still campaigned with top Iowa Republicans on the eve of the election and had not faced the full condemnation of his party until his most recent comments. In a statement on the decision to strip King of his committee assignments, Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives, said: \u201cSteve\u2019s remarks are beneath the dignity of the Party of Lincoln and the United States of America. His comments call into question whether he will treat all Americans equally, without regard for race and ethnicity. House Republicans are clear: we are all in this together, as fellow citizens equal before God and the law. As Congressman King\u2019s fellow citizens, let us hope and pray earnestly that this action will lead to greater reflection and ultimately change on his part. In contrast, King insisted his words had been mischaracterized in a statement and said: \u201cLeader McCarthy\u2019s decision to remove me from committees is a political decision that ignores the truth.\u201d Nick Ryan, a veteran Iowa Republican operative and longtime King critic, told the Guardian of King\u2019s political career, \u201cIt\u2019s over. Just a question of how it all formally ends now.\u201d King still faces the potential for a formal resolution of censure in the House of Representatives. At least two members have introduced such resolutions, including the Democrat Tim Ryan of Ohio, who is joined by the co-sponsors Dave Joyce of Ohio, a Republican, and Dave Loebsack of Iowa, a Democrat. King drew a primary challenge last week from Randy Feenstra, an ardent social conservative who serves in the Iowa state senate.

      "bodyText": "The royal commission into the aged care sector will examine whether nursing homes are unnecessarily turning elderly residents into \u201czombies\u201d amid high rates of sedative medication use. The first hearing is scheduled for Adelaide on Friday and commissioners Richard Tracey and Lynelle Briggs will outline their vision for how the inquiry will operate. Their main task is to examine evidence of substandard aged care, abuse, systematic failures and draw up recommendations for improvement. The controversial practice of \u201cchemical restraint\u201d in aged care homes will also be examined. Ian Yates from the Council on the Ageing said the practice is widespread and unregulated. \u201cA lot of families will complain that their mum or dad, although frail, went into residential care still alert and within a month are like a zombie,\u201d Yates said. A University of Tasmania study of 11,500 nursing homes residents found that more than 60% are taking one or more psychotropics drugs. Senior lecturer in dementia care, Dr Juanita Westbury, has been trialling strategies such as staff training to encourage homes to reduce dependency on medication. \u201cWe found that de-prescribing or lowering doses did not increase behavioural symptoms of the residents, in fact some aspects of behaviour improved upon dose reduction, for example sleep and calling out, when antipsychotics were ceased,\u201d she said. \u201cIf someone can\u2019t communicate because they are dozing in a chair most of the day, is that a good thing? If someone can\u2019t eat their lunch because they are really a bit too disengaged because of the medication, is that a good thing?\u201d Some residents are on the medication for up to 12 months when they should only be on it for a few months, she said. Aged care staff were often not aware of side effects associated with use such as a higher risk of falls, pneumonia and stroke, she said. \u201cMany of the staff believe that these medications are a lot more beneficial than the evidence suggests,\u201d Westbury said. Anxious or agitated behaviour sometimes masked underlying pain, discomfort from environmental factors such as heat or cold, or fear about certain activities, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about proper assessment before you start on the drugs,\u201d Westbury told Guardian Australia. Labor\u2019s aged care spokeswoman, Julie Collins, hopes drugs aren\u2019t being used to make up for a shortfall of staff, programs and rehabilitation or activity sessions. \u201cI hope there are sufficient checks and balances and they are being used appropriately,\u201d she said. Yates expects resourcing will also be a big focus of the commission and hopes the interim report due by the end of October makes solid recommendations around funding in order to feed into the budget cycle. He believes cultural change in the sector is needed, in particular the acknowledgement and willingness of facilities to learn from mistakes. \u201cAged care has been a bit of a forgotten ghetto in this area,\u201d he said. Negative publicity around substandard care in the past year was already causing some people to delay entering facilities, Yates said. He said the commission was likely to uncover \u201ca few\u201d more scandal-plagued nursing homes like the notorious Oakden facility which was shut down in South Australia. Sean Rooney, the chief executive of the aged care industry peak body Leading Age Services Australia, insists the vast majority of services and their dedicated staff deliver outstanding care. \u201cThe whole industry is judged by the behaviours of the participants in the industry. So where there is an issue of abuse and neglect \u2026 when they do happen it reflects poorly on everybody in the system,\u201d he said. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced the royal commission last year and warned the country is going to have to \u201cbrace itself for some difficult stories\u201d. Collins has spoken to a few families who will come forward with stories of abuse following the death of loved ones at nursing homes. \u201cOne of the problems in the system is that people don\u2019t have the confidence to make a complaint at the time; they wait until their loved one is deceased because they fear retribution,\u201d Collins said. The commission will hold hearings in February and March in Adelaide before travelling across Australian cities and regional hubs. The commission\u2019s final report deadline is 30 April 2020.",

      "bodyText": "Powering down for the night, thanks for tuning in! Here\u2019s what happened today: As the shutdown stretched into its forth week, Trump rejected Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s recommendation to reopen it while negotiations continue, and doubled down on his stance, while a bipartisan group of senators sought solutions. Meanwhile, the FDA announced that unpaid inspectors would come back to work, ensuring high-risk food facilities get checked out. A top White House spokesperson is leaving the administration to work for a lobbying firm, and a pair of Obama-appointed judges have pumped the breaks on Trump\u2019s new policy that could squash no-charge contraception nationwide. Republican leaders on the steering committee removed Republican Rep. Steve King from all assignments, while Democrats moved to officially condemn the Iowa Republican\u2019s latest racist comments. Mitt Romney called for his resignation, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested he \u201cfind another line of work\u201d. See you all tomorrow! According to The Daily Beast, the special counsel and NY federal prosecutors are looking into a meeting Trump had in the days before he was inaugurated, for possible evidence that foreigners and donors sought to purchase influence in the administration. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes \u2014 the longtime-ally of the President who was behind a controversial memo, which sought to discredit the special counsel investigation \u2014 was also in attendance, along with dozens of foreign diplomats. Soon after the inauguration breakfast, Nunes began a House intelligence committee investigation, ostensibly aimed at the connections between Trump and Russia, that devolved into a mechanism to defend Trump against those investigating the president. Revelations about Nunes\u2019 cooperation with the White House prompted him to leave the investigation in the hands of his GOP colleagues, but Nunes retained subpoena power. The investigation ended last year after Republicans on the committee said they \u2018found no evidence of collusion between President Donald Trump\u2019s associates and the Kremlin\u2019.\u201d Trump\u2019s former National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his Russian connections and who is cooperating with Mueller\u2019s investigation also attended the breakfast meeting. Amidst heavy backlash over the latest racist comments from Rep. Steve King, Republican party leaders will remove him from the high-powered Judiciary Committee and other panel assignments, the New York Times reports. House Democrats have also made moves to officially condemn his remarks, expecting to vote Tuesday on a resolution from Majority Whip James Clyburn, a senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus. According to The Hill, the vote is unlikely to result in a formal censure but serves to call the congressman out for what he said: \u2018I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in breaking the deafening silence and letting our resounding condemnation be heard\u2019, Clyburn said on the House floor\u201d. President Trump has declined to comment, telling reporters today that he \u201chasn\u2019t been following it\u201d. King is a close ally of the President, supporting him on immigration and other key issues. In one of his first oversight moves as House Judiciary Chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler has issued a letter calling for more information on the Trump Administration\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy that resulted in the separation of migrant families at the southern border. The Departments of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Justice have until February 8 to turn over related documents. CNN has reported that the letter released today requests specifically calls for an unredacted copy of the DHS policy memo and specifics on the numbers of children separated or unaccompanied since the policy was reversed in June: \u2018The latest tragic deaths in custody of young children underscore the need for oversight of the Administration\u2019s policies,\u2019 the letter says\u201d. In the four weeks since the government shutdown began, the FDA was forced to stop inspections at most food facilities. But on Monday, Commissioner Scott Gottlieb announced that 10% of agency workers would come back to work, unpaid. According to The Washington Post, 80% of the food supply is checked by the agency and out of the 160 routine inspections done weekly in the US, about a third are considered \u201chigh-risk\u201d. Inspectors are charged with checking for insect infestations, food contamination, and unclean conditions that can lead to dangerous foodborne illness outbreaks. At the White House, Trump is showing off a spread of fast food he ordered for a visit of the Clemson Tigers, who recently won the College Football Playoff national championship game. The president apparently ordered McDonalds, Wendy\u2019s, Burger King, pizza and other \u201cgreat American food\u201d: With no end to the government shutdown in sight, a group of Democrat and Republican senators have started a group to search for solutions, as party leaders continue the fight over funding. According to The Washington Post, it\u2019s unclear how successful the group will be, but signals how ready representatives are to end the impasse, that has caused roughly 800,000 federal employees to go without pay. The New York Times has reported that White House spokesman Raj Shah, who has been with President Trump since the beginning, has left to lead a lobbying firm based in Florida: Mr. Shah, a former researcher at the Republican National Committee, had been in the administration since Mr. Trump took office. His portfolio recently included helping prepare Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh for his Senate confirmation hearings to the Supreme Court. His departure comes as the White House press and communications teams have been depleted. Several aides have moved on to roles at government agencies or have left the Trump administration entirely\u201d. Mitt Romney has called on Iowa congressman Steve King to resign, CNN\u2019s Manu Raju is reporting: King has faced growing backlash over his recent comments to the New York Times defending the \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d label, saying, \u201cWhite nationalist, white supremacist, western civilization \u2013 how did that language become offensive? ... Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?\u201d Earlier, the Congressional Black Caucus called for King to lose his committee assignments, and the Anti-Defamation League has urged House leaders to censure him. President Trump took to Twitter this afternoon to emphasize his unrelenting position on the border wall, amidst an ongoing impasse with Democrats that has caused the government shutdown to stretch into its forth week. The tweets came shortly after Trump announced to reporters that he rejected a recommendation from Lindsey Graham to reopen the government while negotiations continue. The shutdown, now on its 24th day, is the longest in US history. This is Gabrielle Canon taking over from the west coast for Jamiles Lartey and Erin Durkin. With little time to spare, a Pennsylvania district court judge stepped in this afternoon to stop a soon-to-be-rolled-out Trump administration policy that would enable employers to deny women birth control coverage on moral grounds. The injunction came less than 24 hours after a California judge issued a stay limiting the new rules in 13 states and DC where challenges are still being argued. The new rules were drafted by the Department of Justice to \u201cprotect a narrow class of sincere religious and moral objectors from being forced to facilitate practices that conflict with their beliefs\u201d, but they were rejected by the Obama-appointed judges on the grounds that many would lose contraceptive coverage. In a statement to the Washington Post, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said: \u201cI have no tolerance for such positions and those who espouse these views are not supporters of American ideals and freedoms.\u201d Rep. King\u2019s statements are unwelcome and unworthy of his elected position. If he doesn\u2019t understand why \u2018white supremacy\u2019 is offensive, he should find another line of work.\u201d King has come under fire by members of both parties after he asked in a New York Times interview published last week, \u201cWhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\u201d In an email to supporters this afternoon, Trump is asking totally reasonable and not at all loaded survey questions like this one: Which group should our government put first? American Citizens Illegal Aliens Nancy and Chuck have made it clear that they don\u2019t want to know your opinions on how to keep America safe. They don\u2019t want to know why you want the wall. But I do, Friend. As one of our top supporters, I need your IMMEDIATE input on our Official Secure The Border Survey. I plan to review the responses of every American Patriot before my next meeting with Nancy and Chuck. Politico is reporting that White House officials, \u201cincreasingly desperate to find a path out of a shutdown they\u2019re seen as losing, are considering a last-ditch effort to woo moderate Democrats with a border security deal reopening the government, according to people familiar with the plans.\u201d Democrats have little reason at this point to consider breaking from the party leadership. Updating reports that a bipartisan group of senators is holding their own talks on how to resolve the government shutdown. Texas Senator John Cornyn says he\u2019s involved but not \u201can official gang member.\u201d This is Jamiles Lartey taking over for Erin briefly before we hand our coverage over to the west coast for the rest of the evening. James Clyburn, the number 3 ranking member of the House told reporters a short time ago that he supports a reprimand or formal disapproval of Congressman Steve King\u2019s racist remarks last week, but does not support censure. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we in the House should be censuring somebody or something they said to a reporter. ... If it was something said on the House floor, maybe,\u201d Clyburn said according to Washington Post reporter Mike DeBonis. He said Clyburn added that a formal response to King\u2019s remarks would be \u201cA topic of discussion at House Dem leadership meeting this evening.\u201d Two Democrats have introduced censure language today regarding King. New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand is expected to form an exploratory committee for a presidential campaign in the coming days, per AP. In his speech this afternoon to the American Farm Bureau Federation in New Orleans, Donald Trump took credit for the low price of gas and fit in a swipe at Hillary Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m riding in this incredible car, and I\u2019m driving and I\u2019m looking at gas stations to see how much is the gas,\u201d Trump said in his remarks, according to the Hill. \u201cYou think Hillary Clinton would\u2019ve done that? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m in the Beast,\u201d he said, referring to the presidential limousine. \u201cThe world\u2019s most expensive car. It\u2019s like being in an army tank that goes 50 miles per hour. I\u2019m in the Beast and I\u2019m looking at the gas station. I say, \u2018fellas, slow up, I can\u2019t see.\u2019 I say, \u2018$1.75!\u2019 That didn\u2019t happen by accident, folks.\u201d A House Democrat is introducing a formal censure motion Monday against Rep. Steve King over his white supremacy comments. Rep. Bobby Rush, an Illinois Democrat and member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he would be filing the motion, Politico reported. \u201cHe has become too comfortable with proudly insulting, disrespecting, and denigrating people of color,\u201d Rush said in a statement. \u201cAs with any animal that is rabid, Steve King should be set aside and isolated.\u201d King is under fire after he said he did not understand how the terms \u201cwhite nationalist, white supremacist and western civilization\u201d became \u201coffensive.\u201d The censure resolution also cites his long history of incendiary comments. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has said action will be taken against him. Rep. Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat, is also introducing a separate resolution to censure King. A bipartisan group of senators is holding their own talks on how to resolve the government shutdown, with negotiations between Donald Trump and Congressional leaders at a standstill. Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia, is one member of the group, the Washington Post reported. The White House is denying reports that Ivanka Trump is under consideration to become president of the World Bank. The Financial Times reported that the first daughter\u2019s name was \u201cfloating around Washington\u201d as one possible choice for the World Bank post. Trump is working on the search process, but she is not a candidate for the job, White House spokeswoman Jessica Ditto said, according to Politico. \u201cReports that she is under consideration are false,\u201d she said. Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, is wondering when Donald Trump is \u201cgoing to help us open the government.\u201d Asked about Trump\u2019s rejection of a proposal to let government reopen for three weeks while border wall negotiations continue, she said, \u201cWell, then Mr. President when are you going to help us open the government?\u201d according to CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s just not good for any of us,\u201d she said, describing the situation as an \u201cindefinite state of impasse.\u201d Florida Rep. Alcee Hastings is being treated for pancreatic cancer. Hastings, a Democrat, plans to remain in Congress during the treatment, saying that \u201cthis is a battle worth fighting,\u201d according to CNN. \u201cI was recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and in the midst of this traumatizing news, I found myself wondering not only if I would survive this disease, but also if it would impact my ability to perform my duties,\u201d said Hastings, 82. \u201cNow that I have begun treatment, I feel hopeful about survival and about my ability to continue serving my constituents of Florida\u2019s 20th Congressional district and the nation.\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders will meet this week with women who say they experienced sexual harassment and gender discrimination while working on his presidential campaign, BuzzFeed reported. Sanders has been hit in recent weeks with complaints about mistreatment of female staffers during his 2016 primary campaign. He is considering another bid in 2020. The meeting is set for Wednesday, according to BuzzFeed. The women are traveling to Washington to meet with Sanders and members of his senior staff. Twice as many TSA agents were absent today compared to a year ago, an agency spokesman said. Agents have been calling in sick as they are required to work without pay during the government shutdown. This morning, 7.6% of TSA personnel were absent around the country, compared to 3.2% on this day a year ago, TSA assistant administrator for public affairs Michael Bilello said on Twitter. Airports in Washington, DC, Atlanta, Miami and Houston have closed security lanes due to absences, resulting in long lines. The government shutdown has already caused the cancellation of 42,726 immigration hearings, according to data compiled by Syracuse University, per a New York Daily News reporter. About 20,000 hearings are getting cancelled each week. People whose court dates get cancelled may end up waiting years for a new one. Another poll finds voters are not behind Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to fund the government unless he gets money for a border wall, and hold Republicans responsible for the government shutdown. In the Quinnipiac University poll released today, 63% of voters say they oppose shutting down the government to force funding for the wall. 56% say Trump and Congressional Republicans are responsible for the shutdown, while 36% say Democrats are responsible. Voters support, by a 63%-30% margin, reopening parts of the government that aren\u2019t related to border security while negotiating on wall funding. Voters also generally oppose the wall itself, saying they\u2019re against it by a 55% to 43% margin. Majorities of voters say they do not believe it is a good use of taxpayer money, it would not make the US safer, it is not necessary to protect the border, and it is against American values. Donald Trump is appearing this afternoon at the American Farm Bureau Federation\u2019s annual convention in New Orleans. It\u2019s typically a friendly audience for him, but the government shutdown has shuttered local Farm Service Agency offices, blocking farmers from getting loans and other assistance, Politico reports. \u201cWe have farmers that have loans with the FSA,\u201d Randy Poskin, a corn and soybean grower from central Illinois who voted for Trump, told Politico. \u201cIf they can\u2019t do that business, that\u2019s going to create problems.\u201d Stormy Daniels has filed a civil rights lawsuit over her arrest last summer while performing at an Ohio strip club. In the suit, Daniels charges that the officers from the Columbus Division of Police\u2019s vice unit who arrested her were politically motivated. She cites their voter registration as Republicans and one officer\u2019s pro-Trump Facebook post, and charge that the officers believed she \u201cwas damaging President Trump and they thereafter entered into a conspiracy to arrest her during her performance in Columbus in retaliation for the public statements she had made regarding President Trump.\u201d Daniels was accused of touching patrons and police officers during her strip club performance, but the charges were dropped. \u201cWe look forward to exposing the facts relating to the outrageous conduct of these rogue officers, who abused their power and the badge to further a political vendetta against Stormy,\u201d said her lawyer Michael Avenatti. Daniels says she had a sexual encounter with Trump, and was paid off during the 2016 to keep quiet about it. Donald Trump spoke by phone Monday with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, per CNN. Trump stressed \u201cthe importance to the United States that Turkey does not mistreat the Kurds and other Syrian Democratic Forces with whom we have fought to defeat ISIS,\u201d according to a White House summary of the call. Neomi Rao, Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, wrote a string of op-eds in and after college where she used inflammatory language to discuss race and gay rights, BuzzFeed reports. Rao described race as a \u201chot, money-making issue,\u201d affirmative action as the \u201canointed dragon of liberal excess,\u201d and said welfare was for \u201cfor the indigent and lazy.\u201d Anthony Scaramucci, briefly Donald Trump\u2019s White House communications director, will be a contestant on the next series of Big Brother: Celebrity Edition. He will be joined by Lindsay Lohan\u2019s mother, wrestler Eva Marie and Kato Kaelin, whose fame is almost entirely derived from being a key witness in the OJ Simpson trial. John Kasich has signed with a top talent agency as he leaves office as Ohio governor. United Talent Agency announced Kasich as a client Monday, according to Politico. The agency says it will \u201chelp Kasich navigate the next phase of his career in civic engagement, by continuing to inspire audiences to lead purpose-driven lives of service.\u201d Kasich is a frequent critic of Donald Trump within the Republican party and is reportedly considering a 2020 presidential run. The House Oversight Committee is launching an investigation into prescription drug pricing, under its new Democratic chairman Elijah Cummings. Cummings sent letters to a dozen drug companies seeking details on how they determine prices for their drugs, the Hill reported. \u201cFor years, drug companies have been aggressively increasing prices on existing drugs and setting higher launch prices for new drugs while recording windfall profits,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goals of this investigation are to determine why drug companies are increasing prices so dramatically, how drug companies are using the proceeds, and what steps can be taken to reduce prescription drug prices.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders will introduce a bill this week to raise the federal minimum wage to $15, he said Monday. The current federal minimum is $7.25. Washington Dulles Airport on Monday closed screening lanes because of a shortage of TSA agents, some of whom are calling in sick while not being paid during the government shutdown, Politico reported. Security lines at Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the busiest in the world, were more than an hour long Monday morning after at least six security lanes were closed, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported. Miami and Houston airports also closed checkpoints over the weekend because of high no show rates among TSA agents. Hillary Clinton shared a clip from a 2016 debate where she said that Donald Trump would be a \u201cpuppet\u201d for Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cLike I said: A puppet,\u201d she wrote Monday. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is expressing regret for once working for her father\u2019s anti-gay group, which opposed same sex marriage and promoted gay conversion therapy. The Supreme Court declined Monday to hear a challenge to Matthew Whitaker\u2019s appointment as acting attorney general. The court turned away the case without comment, the Washington Post reported. The suit argued that Trump did not have the authority to put Whitaker in the job and that Rod Rosenstein, the number two to ex-attorney general Jeff Sessions, should have filled the job under proper legal procedures. Donald Trump is rejecting a proposal from Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham to allow the government to temporarily reopen while negotiating with Congress over a border wall, the Washington Post reports. \u201cI did reject it,\u201d Trump said Monday. \u201cI want to get it solved. I don\u2019t want to just delay it.\u201d Graham suggested Sunday that Trump should agree to a government funding bill that would last three weeks. If a compromise were not reached in that time, Trump could declare a national emergency to build the wall without Congressional approval. But Trump said Monday he\u2019s \u201cnot looking to\u201d declare a national emergency, per Politico. Here are fuller remarks that Attorney general nominee William Barr plans to give at his Senate confirmation hearing addressing the Mueller probe, per Huffington Post. Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro said Monday that Donald Trump failed in responding to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. \u201cUnfortunately, as all of us witnessed, the Trump administration failed the people of Puerto Rico when Hurricane Maria hit,\u201d Castro said in San Juan, the Hill reported. Castro spoke at a Latino Victory Fund summit in Puerto Rico after announcing his presidential bid over the weekend in his home town of San Antonio. A number of prominent Democrats have gathered in San Juan for a retreat hosted by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus\u2019s political PAC, as well as the Latino Victory Fund event. \u201cI chose as my first visit after [my] announcement to come to Puerto Rico, because I want all the people of Puerto Rico to know that you count, that we respect you,\u201d Castro said, according to the Hill. Donald Trump responded dismissively when asked about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez saying that he is a racist. \u201cWho cares?\u201d he said in remarks to reporters outside the White House. The new New York Congresswoman says she can tell she\u2019s getting under his skin. Donald Trump declined to condemn Steve King\u2019s remarks about white supremacy, saying when asked by a reporter today: \u201cI haven\u2019t been following it.\u201d King, an Iowa Republican, is under fire after saying to the New York Times, \u201cWhite nationalist, white supremacist, western civilization \u2013 how did that language become offensive?\u201d He\u2019s set to meet today with House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who vowed to take action over the comments. Attorney general nominee William Barr will say it\u2019s \u201cvitally important\u201d for special counsel Robert Mueller to be able to complete his Russia investigation, according to testimony prepared for his confirmation hearing and obtained by the Associated Press. \u201cI believe it is in the best interest of everyone \u2014 the President, Congress, and, most importantly, the American people - that this matter be resolved by allowing the Special Counsel to complete his work,\u201d Barr will say. He also plans to say Congress and the public should be \u201cbe informed of the results of the special counsel\u2019s work,\u201d CNN reported. \u201cFor that reason, my goal will be to provide as much transparency as I can consistent with the law. I can assure you that, where judgments are to be made by me, I will make those judgments based solely on the law and will let no personal, political, or other improper interests influence my decision,\u201d he says in the prepared remarks. The confirmation hearing is set to begin Tuesday. Barr also plans to say Trump has not asked for any promises from him regarding his handling of the investigation. Trump \u201csought no assurances, promises, or commitments from me of any kind, either express or implied, and I have not given him any,\u201d he says in the prepared remarks, according to AP. Donald Trump will meet with Clemson\u2019s national champion football team at the White House after returning from a trip to New Orleans, and had some thoughts on their culinary preferences before he took off. \u201cThey\u2019ll be coming tonight, and I think we\u2019ll serve McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s and Burger King with some pizza,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI would think that\u2019s their favorite food.\u201d Donald Trump in remarks outside the White House claimed that some Democrats are \u201cbreaking\u201d in the government shutdown fight while Republicans are \u201crock solid.\u201d Trump is refusing to sign off on government funding unless he gets money for a wall on the US-Mexico border, leading to a partial shutdown of the government. Trump noted some Democratic lawmakers have been in Puerto Rico, where they traveled as part of a Congressional delegation. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re celebrating the shutdown,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of them are breaking. The Republicans are rock solid. We\u2019ve got to take care of the border,\u201d Trump went on. \u201cThe Democrats have to do something. We need their votes. Otherwise we can\u2019t solve it.\u201d Donald Trump called the FBI officials who started an investigation into whether he had worked on Russia\u2019s behest \u201cknown scoundrels. I guess you could say they\u2019re dirty cops.\u201d \u201cI never worked for Russia. And you know that answer better than anybody. I never worked for Russia. Not only did I never work for Russia, I think it\u2019s a disgrace that you even asked that question because it\u2019s a whole big fat hoax. It\u2019s just a hoax,\u201d Trump said. But Trump then appeared to confirm the investigation existed, complaining about the officials who started it. He singled out Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI, and agents Lisa Page and Peter Strzok. \u201cI guess they started it because I fired Comey, which was a great thing I did for our country,\u201d he said. \u201cI have done a great service for our country when I fired James Comey, because he was a bad cop and he was a dirty cop and he lied.\u201d Trump also discussed a meeting he had with Vladimir Putin, where the Washington Post reported he took his translator\u2019s notes and told him not to disclose the contents of the meeting to other US officials. \u201cThat was a very good meeting. It was actually a very successful meeting,\u201d he said, adding they had discussed Israel and an oil pipeline. \u201cWe have those meetings all the time. No big deal.\u201d Donald Trump is explicitly denying he ever worked for Russia. \u201cI never worked for Russia,\u201d he told reporters outside the White House, per AP. Previously, Trump had called the question \u201cinsulting\u201d but did not directly answer. Here\u2019s some new advice from Donald Trump to members of the press: Take a nice long vacation. \u201cChill!\u201d he added in a tweet that also repeated his attacks on \u201cFake News\u201d and claimed journalists have \u201cgone MAD!\u201d A New York immigration group is launching a $1 million campaign to get the state to grant drivers licenses to undocumented immigrants, the Daily News reports. Issuing the drivers licenses has become a real possibility, along with a slew of other progressive measures, since Democrats took over the state Senate in New York, which had been the last bastion of Republican control in the state. The New York Immigration Coalition will fund a Super PAC and spend at least $1 million on TV, radio and online ads. There are dozens of out of work former members of Congress, many of them looking for lobbying gigs and not all of them likely to get one, Politico reports this morning. \u201cFormer Republican congressmen are a dime a dozen right now,\u201d former Rep. Tom Davis (R-Va.), now a lobbyist for Holland &amp; Knight, told Politico. \u201cI think there are still a lot of people who are scrambling and looking.\u201d Some lawmakers already have lobbying gigs, though. Former Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lamar Smith joined Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld. Sen. Jon Kyl, who left Covington &amp; Burling to temporarily fill John McCain\u2019s Arizona Senate seat after his death, has now returned to his old firm. CBS News has announced its roster of 2020 campaign reporters, and it\u2019s drawing some criticism for not including any black journalists. Donald Trump on Dec. 11 said of the possibility of a government shutdown: \u201cI am proud to shut down the government for border security.\u201d If that left any doubt, he said: \u201cI will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I\u2019m not going to blame you for it.\u201d This morning, on the 24th day of the partial shutdown, he said of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer: \u201cNancy and Cryin\u2019 Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes. At this point it has become their, and the Democrats, fault!\u201d Donald Trump invoked one of the worst massacres against Native Americans in US history late last night as a way to continue mocking Senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren over her claims of Native American heritage. \u201cIf Elizabeth Warren, often referred to by me as Pocahontas, did this commercial from Bighorn or Wounded Knee instead of her kitchen, with her husband dressed in full Indian garb, it would have been a smash!\u201d he wrote. US soldiers killed up to 400 Sioux at the Wounded Knee massacre in South Dakota in 1890. Critics, who have long called Trump\u2019s use of \u201cPocahontas\u201d as a slur offensive, denounced his latest comments. Senior FBI officials met soon after Donald Trump fired James Comey as FBI director to discuss launching an investigation into whether the president had been acting on behalf of Russia, according to transcripts of congressional testimony obtained by CNN. The group debated a range of possibilities: at one extreme, the possibility that Trump fired Comey on direct instructions from Russia. At the other end, that he had done nothing wrong and was appropriately exercising his executive power. James Baker, then the FBI general counsel, said in the House interview last year that the bureau officials were discussing whether Trump was \u201cacting at the behest of and somehow following directions, somehow executing their will,\u201d according to CNN. \u201cThat was one extreme. The other extreme is that the President is completely innocent, and we discussed that too,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThere\u2019s a range of things this could possibly be. We need to investigate, because we don\u2019t know whether, you know, the worst-case scenario is possibly true or the President is totally innocent and we need to get this thing over with \u2014 and so he can move forward with his agenda.\u201d Baker said the possibility of Trump taking orders from Russia was \u201cdiscussed as a theoretical possibility.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m speaking theoretically. If the President of the United States fired Jim Comey at the behest of the Russian government, that would be unlawful and unconstitutional,\u201d Baker said. \u201cIs that what happened here?\u201d asked Rep. John Ratcliffe, a Texas Republican. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Baker said. At that point the FBI cut off the line of questioning.",

And it\u2019s just progressing, getting worse and worse. Unfortunately, our district is allowing that to take place.\u201d On the streets, at least, strikers had the support of honking drivers and the parents of those they teach, and a man selling bacon-wrapped hot dogs said he was offering them a dollar off. Stacey McKenna, the mother of a child at Mulholland middle school, said she supports the strike, even though it means her daughter will miss a few lessons. \u201cThey are not asking for anything unreasonable,\u201d she said. \u201cSmaller class sizes, more support staff like librarians, counselors, nurses \u2013 staff we used to have at school all day, every day, and now get maybe one or two days a week if we\u2019re lucky.\u201d She hopes the school district learns a lesson itself. \u201cProfit isn\u2019t everything,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are more important things out there, like educating our kids.\u201d",

It was dusk, and I had come to the beach after work to swim. I was a Victorian kid, used to long summer twilights that at their height slipped away around 10pm, like a guest regretfully leaving a dinner party. I was swimming near the Pavilion when two things happened at once: it suddenly got quite dark and a rip took me out quite deep and at speed towards Ben Buckler Point.</p> <p>The lifeguards had gone home. I had passed them packing up their stations as I wiggled out of my corporate clothes with eyes only for the ocean.</p> <p>But now I wasn\u2019t so much drifting out as being towed as if by an invisible speedboat. It got darker still, like someone dimming the lights. I knew not to swim against the current but panic overrode this. The stronger the current, the more I pushed against it. It was like trying to move a mountain. Messy waves crashed over my head. I started freaking out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2019/jan/14/open-thread-tell-us-about-your-favourite-australian-beach\">Open thread: tell us about your favourite Australian beach</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I flung my arm in the air and waved it around. A young lifesaver packing up his watch saw me and got to me fast on his board. I can still see it now, like it just happened \u2013 the two of us in the black churning ocean, the feeling of my hands curling around the yellow plastic board, deep gulps of air. I clung on the side but it was no match for the current.</p> <p>Now my rescuer was in trouble too, and we both continued to drift at speed. But the alarm had been raised \u2013 more lifesavers came to us on an inflatable motorised raft.</p> <p>When I was deposited on the sand, gasping and spent, I lay there for a long time, in the proper dark, thoroughly exhausted but also full of wonder. The sea will kill you if you\u2019re not careful. The democracy of the ocean cuts both ways.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bea23c9c0825c9f0e827f0e4027a29e7fe0fec2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bea23c9c0825c9f0e827f0e4027a29e7fe0fec2/0_0_4012_2568/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The sea will kill you if you\u2019re not careful\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"640\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The sea will kill you if you\u2019re not careful.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tracey Nearmy/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>***</p> <p>More than once when travelling, I\u2019ve sat at a table with strangers, all Australian, and we\u2019ll spend a pleasant evening swapping stories about the ocean. Our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2019/jan/14/australias-best-beaches-poll-vote-for-your-top-seaside-spots\">favourite beaches</a>, the secret spots and, of course, the times we\u2019ve almost died.</p> <p>Most people I know have a story; where the ocean has sucked them out to sea, or smashed them against rocks, or slammed them hard into a sandbank, and they have to wiggle their toes to see if they\u2019ll ever be able to walk again. Yet still we go back in; crazy in love, unable to stay away. Promising to be more careful next time.</p> <p>What draws us to the beach again and again and again? Why do we take our children down to the water before they can ride a bike or cross a road? Why do we go waist deep and hold their bodies partially submerged and tell them it will be OK?</p> <p>I sometimes think the sea is our missing element, that a bit of it should have been put in us when we were made. How else can you explain that feeling of being in the water? It\u2019s the feeling of being whole.</p> <p>It\u2019s the feeling of coming home.</p>",

The river is full of children learning how to be here. *** At the baths the other day a woman was telling her young son she was washing away her day. \u201cDid you have a bad day?\u201d \u201cYes I had a bad day.\u201d And under she went, into the green water, and washed it away. It\u2019s our own best medicine, we prescribe it to ourselves and each other for all manner of things: jetlag, heartbreak, hangovers, colds, headaches, sore muscles, fatigue. We go to the beach to feel alive again. It\u2019s always worth it \u2013 the malarkey of the sand and sunscreen and finding a park and a clean towel and getting changed. You never regret a swim. For the most part. *** Once I had to be rescued at Bondi. It was dusk, and I had come to the beach after work to swim. I was a Victorian kid, used to long summer twilights that at their height slipped away around 10pm, like a guest regretfully leaving a dinner party. I was swimming near the Pavilion when two things happened at once: it suddenly got quite dark and a rip took me out quite deep and at speed towards Ben Buckler Point. The lifeguards had gone home. I had passed them packing up their stations as I wiggled out of my corporate clothes with eyes only for the ocean. But now I wasn\u2019t so much drifting out as being towed as if by an invisible speedboat. It got darker still, like someone dimming the lights. I knew not to swim against the current but panic overrode this. The stronger the current, the more I pushed against it. It was like trying to move a mountain. Messy waves crashed over my head. I started freaking out. I flung my arm in the air and waved it around. A young lifesaver packing up his watch saw me and got to me fast on his board. I can still see it now, like it just happened \u2013 the two of us in the black churning ocean, the feeling of my hands curling around the yellow plastic board, deep gulps of air. I clung on the side but it was no match for the current. Now my rescuer was in trouble too, and we both continued to drift at speed. But the alarm had been raised \u2013 more lifesavers came to us on an inflatable motorised raft. When I was deposited on the sand, gasping and spent, I lay there for a long time, in the proper dark, thoroughly exhausted but also full of wonder. The sea will kill you if you\u2019re not careful. The democracy of the ocean cuts both ways. *** More than once when travelling, I\u2019ve sat at a table with strangers, all Australian, and we\u2019ll spend a pleasant evening swapping stories about the ocean. Our favourite beaches, the secret spots and, of course, the times we\u2019ve almost died. Most people I know have a story; where the ocean has sucked them out to sea, or smashed them against rocks, or slammed them hard into a sandbank, and they have to wiggle their toes to see if they\u2019ll ever be able to walk again. Yet still we go back in; crazy in love, unable to stay away. Promising to be more careful next time. What draws us to the beach again and again and again? Why do we take our children down to the water before they can ride a bike or cross a road? Why do we go waist deep and hold their bodies partially submerged and tell them it will be OK? I sometimes think the sea is our missing element, that a bit of it should have been put in us when we were made. How else can you explain that feeling of being in the water? It\u2019s the feeling of being whole. It\u2019s the feeling of coming home.",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of people have gathered in cities across Poland after the fatal stabbing of Gda\u0144sk mayor Pawe\u0142Adamowicz in protest at what some say is a creeping pervasiveness of hate speech in Poland\u2019s national discourse. In Gda\u0144sk, thousands gathered for a minute\u2019s silence at the statue of Neptune in the city\u2019s Long Market, which also hosts the city hall, where Adamowicz served as mayor for more than 20 years. Adamowicz died after he was stabbed in the chest on stage at a charity concert on Sunday evening. They were addressed by the European council president, Donald Tusk, a Gda\u0144sk native, friend and longtime ally of Adamowicz. In an emotional address, Tusk addressed Adamowicz directly: \u201cMy dear Pawe\u0142, we are here with you today as your friends. You had to wait so long, until such a tragic moment, to see from up there just how many friends you have here in Gdansk.\u201d Aleksandra Nabo\u017cny, who came with her father to pay her respects at a candlelit vigil by the statue of Neptune, said: \u201cWe are very sad, and deeply, deeply hurt by what has happened. \u201cWe used to see him walking to work in his suit and with his briefcase, stopping and talking to people, wanting to be kind to everyone. He and the city were a perfect match.\u201d Agata O\u0142ubowicz, a local architect, fighting back tears as she spoke, said: \u201cWe were having such a happy celebration of the Great Christmas Orchestra charity, when people are collecting money for children and older people, it\u2019s a moment that connects people, and the next moment, someone from the crowd appears with a knife. \u201cThe silence was very powerful \u2013 we were alone with our thoughts, but we were connected again.\u201d Adamowicz died on Monday after undergoing more than five hours of surgery on Sunday night. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t win,\u201d said Poland\u2019s health minister, \u0141ukasz Szumowski. Dr Tomasz Stefaniak, the director of the hospital where Adamowicz was treated, said: \u201cWith the deepest regret we must inform that unfortunately we lost the struggle for the life of the president of the city. Honour to his memory.\u201d The alleged assailant, a 27-year-old man from Gda\u0144sk with a record of violent crime, was released from prison last month, it emerged on Monday. After the stabbing, the assailant told the crowd he blamed Adamowicz\u2019s former political party Civic Platform for his jailing in 2014 for a series of violent attacks. Adamowicz, a popular, liberal mayor, had long been considered a hate figure in far-right circles for his vigorous defence of migrants and refugees and LGBT rights, but no evidence has emerged that the attack was politically motivated. Some in Poland are blaming the stabbing on a more general rise in social tensions and an increasing prevalence of hate speech. Even before his death, silent protests had been planned in a number of cities on Monday. The assassination of Adamowicz, a six-term mayor who often mingled freely with the citizens of his city, sent Poland into shock. In Gda\u0144sk, the city flag was lowered to half-mast and a mass was planned for later in the day. Politicians from across the political spectrum condemned the stabbing, including the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, the interior minister, Joachim Brudzi\u0144ski, and other members of the ruling nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS). Adamowicz was known as an opponent of PiS. Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the PiS leader, was quoted as saying in a tweet from a party spokeswoman: \u201cI\u2019m expressing great pain for the tragic death due to the criminal attack on mayor Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz. We express solidarity with his family.\u201d Adamowicz was part of the democratic opposition formed in Gda\u0144sk under the leadership of Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa during the 1980s. After leaving Civic Platform, he was re-elected for a sixth term as an independent candidate late last year. As mayor he was a progressive voice, supporting sex education in schools, LGBT rights and tolerance for minorities. He showed solidarity with the Jewish community when windows at Gda\u0144sk synagogue were broken last year, strongly denouncing the vandalism. Adamowicz\u2019s wife, Magdalena, was in the United States at the time of the attack, visiting her daughter. She flew to the UK on Monday and the Polish government sent a plane to London to bring her back to Poland. Associated Press contributed to this report",
