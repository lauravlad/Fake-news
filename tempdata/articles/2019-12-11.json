Its final day saw an update to the list of things you shouldn\u2019t keep in the fridge, with the likes of honey, potatoes and avocados now joined by \u201cthe UK prime minister\u201d. All the party leaders embarked on a frantic cross-country campaigning dash on Wednesday, but only one of them \u2026 no, I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t face it yet. Give it a minute.</p> \n<p>At dawn, Boris Johnson embarked on a sort of softcore Confessions of a Prime Minister tour, which by 10am had already seen him dress up as a milkman, then pop something in someone\u2019s oven. What next? Pool boy? Cable guy? At this rate of innuendo it seemed reasonable to assume Johnson would simply be barebacking grateful activists live on the lunchtime news. Of course, his version of all this does subvert the classic porn trope. Traditionally, it\u2019s a blue-collar guy coming to the suburban professional\u2019s house while he\u2019s out at work. In this case, it\u2019s an old Etonian milkman knocking on the door of working-class homes. Someone\u2019s certainly going to get screwed, but not in a sexual way.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, things would take a wrong turn for Johnson back at the dairy \u2013 a sentence I might once have found mildly unusual, before I realised that Johnson\u2019s workwear adviser for this election was probably going to get a CBE in the new year honours. This week alone, Johnson has dressed up as a fisherman, a digger driver, a milkman, a builder and a baker. How old is his election strategist? I assume they say basgetti instead of spaghetti, and still wear pull-up nappies at night. Yet despite the relish with which Johnson embraces cosplaying as a working man, he always seems oversized and grotesquely out of place in these scenes, as though a vast unlicensed buttock implant has just been cast in Camberwick Green.</p> \n<p>Anyway: the fridge. Back at the Modern Milkman HQ, a producer for Good Morning Britain, filming live, asked whether the programme could get a chat with the prime minister. \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d said a senior Conservative source called Rob Oxley, still live on air.

Without wishing to go out on a limb, then, it is difficult to imagine Winston Churchill fleeing a lone Path\u00e9 news camera to conceal himself inside a refrigerator. Johnson\u2019s move forces an urgent reordering of the top three most embarrassing places British politicians have hidden because they couldn\u2019t handle the consequences of their actions.

I warn you that you will have poverty \u2013 when pensions slip and benefits are whittled away by a government that won\u2019t pay in an economy that can\u2019t pay. I warn you that you will be cold \u2013 when fuel charges are used as a tax system that the rich don\u2019t notice and the poor can\u2019t afford \u2026 I warn you not to be ordinary, I warn you not to be young, I warn you not to fall ill and I warn you not to grow old.\u201d Kinnock was right to warn us, but lost the election. Let\u2019s not make the same mistake again. John Rushby Church Fenton, North Yorkshire \u2022 Thank you, Philip Pullman (Drip by drip, this country has been poisoned. Let\u2019s make Britain humane again, Journal, 11 December). Your writing was beautiful, true and heartbreaking. Those like me who are the same age as you remember being brought up in a country which shared a \u201ccommon understanding of the value of civic decency\u201d. What can we do, you ask? When decades of political engagement and argument seems to have got us nowhere, I\u2019m in despair and out of answers. But for years now I have hung on to the view I came across in Alasdair MacIntyre\u2019s After Virtue. \u201cWhat matters at this stage is the construction of new forms of community within which civility and \u2026 moral life can be sustained through the dark ages which are already upon us.\u201d If our grandchildren are to grow up to shape a future world where moral integrity, a good civil society, truth and justice are central to its existence then we must keep our candles alight and pass them on.

I urge anyone who is yet undecided how to vote on Thursday to vote for any party other than the Conservatives to ensure that our parliamentary democracy is safeguarded.

With nearly all of the relevant information now available, this is when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/10/tactical-voting-across-the-uk-a-region-by-region-guide\" title=\"\">tactical voting</a> moves on from endless speculation and debate to a politically meaningful choice. And since there isn\u2019t a single authoritative source of information on how to reverse-engineer a broken electoral system, it is a choice you\u2019ll need to make for yourself. Here\u2019s how to do it right.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/08/tactical-voting-guide-2019-keep-tories-out-remain-voter-general-election\">Tactical voting guide 2019: the 50 seats where it is vital to keep the Tories out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First, it is now probably safe to visit your favourite tactical voting aggregator site to see what the postcode-based advisory websites are saying. I\u2019m not posting a link here as it is my firm conviction that if you aren\u2019t already aware of these things, you\u2019re probably best off not bothering. Because what the postcode sites will tell you is one of three things:</p> <p> You may be in a safe seat where tactical voting will not make any difference. In which case, vote for your favourite party, as it has a slight benefit in terms of the <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/foi/transparency-publications/hoc-transparency-publications/financial-information/financial-assistance-to-opposition-parties/\" title=\"\">short money</a> it will receive.</p> <p>Or it is really obvious which party you should tactically vote for, because everyone agrees on who\u2019s in second place. In which case you probably already knew that.</p> <p>Or tactical voting could, in principle, make a difference, but it is not obvious which party you should vote for.</p> <p>In the third case, it really isn\u2019t a good idea to look at the various websites and go with whatever a majority of them say. The fact that they differ at all shows that there is normal statistical error in the forecasting process, and it is likely that as a well-informed voter of reasonable intelligence and diligence, you can outperform them by making use of information that isn\u2019t assembled in a numerical dataset.</p> <p>More importantly than that, tactical voting is, fundamentally, a coordination problem, not a forecasting problem. What the tactical voters want to do is maximise the chance that they all pick the same candidate. Knowing which candidate is currently likely to be in second place is an important piece of information to solve that problem, but it\u2019s not the be-all and end-all, particularly in cases (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/08/tactical-voting-guide-2019-keep-tories-out-remain-voter-general-election\" title=\"\">such as Kensington</a>), where the margin of forecasting error is large compared to the gaps between parties.</p> <p>So you may use the postcode sites as one piece of information. But you must also consider these things:</p> <p><strong>1. You need a very good reason to vote against a sitting non-Tory MP</strong>. The fact that someone is the incumbent MP means that there is proof they can win; you don\u2019t have to worry so much about the willingness of other people to vote tactically for them. And they are easier to coordinate on because they have greater name recognition.</p> <p><strong>2. If you have really good local knowledge, use it</strong>. If there\u2019s a special factor in your constituency which means that polling data or extrapolations from national swings might not be reliable, use that to decide close calls. This might be a smart thing to do in the half-dozen London constituencies where the Jewish electorate is large compared to the usual margin of victory. If there are a lot of other people who will not vote Labour no matter what, the tactical thing to do is join them.</p> <p><strong>3. Pay attention to the ground game</strong>. The number of votes that are likely to be swayed by tactical voting is small. It is likely to be unusually large in this election but, according to surveys, we are <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/12/10/whos-tactically-voting-and-why\" title=\"\">still talking about</a> just under 20% of Labour voters and 36% of Lib Dem voters. And many of these people will be doing so in constituencies where it is obvious what to do; in close and difficult races, the \u201ceffective tactical margin\u201d will be reduced by people voting tactically the wrong way. So the actual effect on the result is going to be similar in magnitude to the <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/is-it-worth-doorknocking-evidence-from-a-united-kingdombased-get-out-the-vote-gotv-field-experiment-on-the-effect-of-party-leaflets-and-canvass-visits-on-voter-turnout/757F1AF7D16F43A444BDDE55181471B5https:/www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/is-it-worth-doorknocking-evidence-from-a-united-kingdombased-get-out-the-vote-gotv-field-experiment-on-the-effect-of-party-leaflets-and-canvass-visits-on-voter-turnout/757F1AF7D16F43A444BDDE55181471B5\" title=\"\">roughly 4% effect</a> from a normal leaflet campaign, and even the 0.5-1% advantage from on-the-day canvassing could make a difference. If you think one party has been working particularly hard in your area, take that into account.</p> <p><strong>4. </strong><a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/uk-general-election-2019/\" title=\"\"><strong>YouGov MRP</strong></a><strong> is first among equals</strong>. The model, which <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/12/10/final-2019-general-election-mrp-model-small-\" title=\"\">published its final forecast last night</a>, is not necessarily the best, but it\u2019s the one that most people pay attention to. Your fellow tactical voters will be looking at it, so you should look at it too.</p> <p><strong>5. And finally, recognise that this is a losing hand</strong>. When you\u2019re thinking seriously about tactical voting, you\u2019re holding bad cards and hoping for a stroke of luck. The likelihood is that the party that you want to defeat will get in; you might not even have particularly good odds of making the situation better rather than worse yourself.</p> <p>You\u2019re taking a gamble, and it\u2019s a decision you\u2019re going to have to live with. For me, this is the real reason not to look at voter guides or postcode websites. Figuring it out for yourself, rather than outsourcing your decision to someone else, will be easier to live with if it all goes wrong. Good luck.</p> <p>\u2022 Dan Davies is a former Bank of England economist and investment banking analyst</p>",

With nearly all of the relevant information now available, this is when tactical voting moves on from endless speculation and debate to a politically meaningful choice. And since there isn\u2019t a single authoritative source of information on how to reverse-engineer a broken electoral system, it is a choice you\u2019ll need to make for yourself. Here\u2019s how to do it right. First, it is now probably safe to visit your favourite tactical voting aggregator site to see what the postcode-based advisory websites are saying. I\u2019m not posting a link here as it is my firm conviction that if you aren\u2019t already aware of these things, you\u2019re probably best off not bothering. Because what the postcode sites will tell you is one of three things: You may be in a safe seat where tactical voting will not make any difference. In which case, vote for your favourite party, as it has a slight benefit in terms of the short money it will receive. Or it is really obvious which party you should tactically vote for, because everyone agrees on who\u2019s in second place. In which case you probably already knew that. Or tactical voting could, in principle, make a difference, but it is not obvious which party you should vote for. In the third case, it really isn\u2019t a good idea to look at the various websites and go with whatever a majority of them say. The fact that they differ at all shows that there is normal statistical error in the forecasting process, and it is likely that as a well-informed voter of reasonable intelligence and diligence, you can outperform them by making use of information that isn\u2019t assembled in a numerical dataset. More importantly than that, tactical voting is, fundamentally, a coordination problem, not a forecasting problem. What the tactical voters want to do is maximise the chance that they all pick the same candidate. Knowing which candidate is currently likely to be in second place is an important piece of information to solve that problem, but it\u2019s not the be-all and end-all, particularly in cases (such as Kensington), where the margin of forecasting error is large compared to the gaps between parties. So you may use the postcode sites as one piece of information. But you must also consider these things: 1. You need a very good reason to vote against a sitting non-Tory MP. The fact that someone is the incumbent MP means that there is proof they can win; you don\u2019t have to worry so much about the willingness of other people to vote tactically for them. And they are easier to coordinate on because they have greater name recognition. 2. If you have really good local knowledge, use it. If there\u2019s a special factor in your constituency which means that polling data or extrapolations from national swings might not be reliable, use that to decide close calls. This might be a smart thing to do in the half-dozen London constituencies where the Jewish electorate is large compared to the usual margin of victory. If there are a lot of other people who will not vote Labour no matter what, the tactical thing to do is join them. 3. Pay attention to the ground game. The number of votes that are likely to be swayed by tactical voting is small. It is likely to be unusually large in this election but, according to surveys, we are still talking about just under 20% of Labour voters and 36% of Lib Dem voters. And many of these people will be doing so in constituencies where it is obvious what to do; in close and difficult races, the \u201ceffective tactical margin\u201d will be reduced by people voting tactically the wrong way. So the actual effect on the result is going to be similar in magnitude to the roughly 4% effect from a normal leaflet campaign, and even the 0.5-1% advantage from on-the-day canvassing could make a difference. If you think one party has been working particularly hard in your area, take that into account. 4. YouGov MRP is first among equals. The model, which published its final forecast last night, is not necessarily the best, but it\u2019s the one that most people pay attention to. Your fellow tactical voters will be looking at it, so you should look at it too. 5. And finally, recognise that this is a losing hand. When you\u2019re thinking seriously about tactical voting, you\u2019re holding bad cards and hoping for a stroke of luck. The likelihood is that the party that you want to defeat will get in; you might not even have particularly good odds of making the situation better rather than worse yourself. You\u2019re taking a gamble, and it\u2019s a decision you\u2019re going to have to live with. For me, this is the real reason not to look at voter guides or postcode websites. Figuring it out for yourself, rather than outsourcing your decision to someone else, will be easier to live with if it all goes wrong. Good luck. \u2022 Dan Davies is a former Bank of England economist and investment banking analyst",

      "bodyText": "Between the Olympic stadium, the London Aquatics Centre, and the ArcelorMittal Orbit squiggle \u2013 not to mention Westfield shopping centre \u2013 the east London neighbourhood of Stratford has acquired more than its fair share of high-profile buildings in the last decade. But even as the Olympics recedes into the past, a new debate is now raging over what might be the most controversial proposal yet: the Madison Square Garden (MSG) Sphere. In March this year, MSG submitted a planning application for a spherical entertainment complex, 90 metres high and 120 metres wide, containing restaurants, shops, a nightclub and the centrepiece: a 21,500-capacity auditorium. The same diameter as the London Eye and almost as tall as Big Ben, the giant sphere will be covered 190,000 sq ft of LEDs, programmable to display images on the exterior. What MSG London executive vice-president Jayne McGivern describes as \u201ca joyous ball of magic\u201d, Newham councillor Harvinder Singh Virdee has called a \u201cblob\u201d, and another local activist \u201cunprecedentedly monstrous\u201d. The project has received support from the Newham Chamber of Commerce and representatives of nearby Newham College and the University of East London. Other residents are more concerned, and have formed a campaign group called Stop MSG Sphere. Their main objections regard noise and light pollution, increased traffic and the resulting rise in air pollution, anti-social behaviour, and strain on public transport and roads. There are also worries that it will block out natural light to homes, some of which are located only 50 metres away. Then there is the advertising. In the artists\u2019 blueprints, the \u201cskin\u201d of LEDs displays wholesome scenes of the night sky or planet Earth, but the planning application allows for advertising, potentially presenting the opportunity for a kind of giant spherical version of Times Square or Piccadilly Circus. \u201cThe advertising has been a whitewash,\u201d says Lindesay Mace of Stop MSG Sphere. \u201cThey show very few examples [in the blueprints], and they\u2019re all calming, blue background, which blends in with the sky. I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to expect that the reality won\u2019t be like that.\u201d MSG counter that under the plans submitted, advertising will be allowed for a maximum of 50% of the time the Sphere is illuminated, and that the facade will be turned off or placed in a low luminance \u201cstand by\u201d mode from midnight to 6am in the summer and 7am during winter and spring. The Sphere would be located on triangular piece of land behind Stratford station. \u201cIt\u2019s a densely populated residential area,\u201d says Mace, \u201cwhich is something that MSG have done their very best in their images and assessments to downplay: there are thousands of residential properties nearby.\u201d MSG claim that impacts to the surrounding area will be minimal, pointing to the fact that the site is also surrounded by live railway lines. There have also been objections from Newham Council, which in July backed a report critical of the Sphere, and voted that it be submitted to the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) for consideration. But activists point out that McGivern, who has been the public face of the company locally, was a board member of the LLDC from 2012-16. In November, campaigners also released correspondence between senior staff at the LLDC and MSG London, acquired through freedom of information requests, in which the two parties discussed the US company\u2019s \u201cstrategy\u201d to deal with \u201clocal resistance\u201d. The emails also pointed to 33 unminuted meetings and apparently unrecorded hospitality for LLDC staff. MSG say there is nothing irregular or unusual in this. Backers of the proposals point to a summer poll, commissioned by MSG Sphere, that found 85% support among local residents. They say it will bring employment to the area, in construction and in the culture sector. Campaigners counter that only 21% of those polled had heard of the proposals, and only 11% of the MSG Sphere specifically. McGivern nevertheless cites the poll as a major indicator of support. \u201cThe poll demonstrates overwhelming local support for MSG Sphere, including for the thousands of jobs and significant economic impact this state-of-the-art entertainment and music venue would bring,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are obviously delighted at this high level of excitement for the project and look forward to continuing to work with and listen to our local stakeholders.\u201d The next consultation public consultation will be held on 16 December. The company is promoting the idea that London needs another music venue of that size.

MSG also claims that a smaller venue also included in the planning application, with a capacity of 1,500, and a 450-capacity nightclub will have a positive trickle-down effect on smaller music venues and local acts in London. Local scepticism, however, derives in part from the experience of hosting the Olympics, for which tens of thousands of jobs were promised by the LLDC that protesters pointed out this summer have still not materialised. \u201cObviously the Olympics left positives, like the park and the sports facilities,\u201d Mace said. \u201cBut it has also left us with the LLDC, an unelected corporation without any real accountability, a planning authority for a lot of land that was previously under local authority control.
