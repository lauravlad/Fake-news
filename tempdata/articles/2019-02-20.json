In February 2018 the New Zealand government announced it would hold a royal commission or judicial inquiry into abuse in state care, which it said would begin in January 2019. More than 100,000 New Zealand children and adults were held in state institutions between the 1950 and 1990s, and many suffered serious sexual, physical and psychological abuse. In November prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the scope of the commission would be widened to include faith-based organisations. But more than a month after it was scheduled to begin, there has been little action, and survivors claim they no longer trust the commission or expect to see justice. \u201cIt\u2019s a fiasco.

In a formal update on 1 February, the royal commission said \u201cthe inquiry is beginning to take shape\u201d. The commissioners had \u201cestablished a vision for the inquiry\u201d. But survivor advocates say no care plans are in place for vulnerable survivors who are registering their cases, and the lack of support is taking its toll on their mental and physical health, and that of the wider whanau [family]. \u2018Huge frustration\u2019 Ken Clearwater is the manager of Male Survivors of Sexual Abuse Aotearoa, and a survivor himself. He said the group was being treated as \u201csecond-class citizens\u201d, and members were being re-traumatised before the commission had begun formally hearing evidence.

This was supposed to start in January, we\u2019re now in February, they still haven\u2019t got the terms of reference sorted out in layman\u2019s language,\u201d said Clearwater. Liz Tonks from the Network of Survivors of Faith-based Institutional Abuse was involved in the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, and praised the Australian commission for its immediate and comprehensive support for survivors. By comparison, Tonks said the New Zealand royal commission was failing. There has been at least one privacy breach Tonks is aware of, when the commission released the name and email address of a survivor to different survivor with the same first name. The commission apologised for the breach, promising it was an isolated incident. The survivor received two sessions of counselling with a psychologist as compensation for the breach, paid for by the commission. The survivor said he remained in two minds as to whether he would further engage with the commission. \u201cThe whole thing has left me with little trust in the royal commission and has left me in a vulnerable place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt goes right back to my childhood when I was placed in the care of people that I was supposed to trust to protect me but didn\u2019t.\u201d The survivor has yet to hear back from the commission about what measures they have put in place to ensure a privacy breach does not happen again. Tonks said: \u201cThere are no safeguards being put in place for vulnerable survivors, it\u2019s all very ad-hoc, and communication with survivors is being led by comms people \u2013 not experts. It is turning them [the survivors] off the process and making them scared.\u201d A partner of a survivor recently implored the commission to better support and understand the needs of the people they were dealing with. \u201cI think you have forgotten, already, that mistrust of those in authority is real for those abused, as is the thinking that when things get too hard it is easier to just give up than to keep hitting a brick wall,\u201d the woman wrote. The royal commission said in a statement \u201cexpectations have been high among survivors\u201d for swift progress, and careful planning was underway to provide a safe and secure environment for survivors before hearings began.

There were two changes from the 6-0 Premier League hiding of Chelsea, with the injured John Stones replaced by Otamendi and David Silva chosen ahead of Oleksandr Zinchenko, who dropped to the bench. Domenico Tedesco, Schalke\u2019s 33-year-old coach, selected the former City centre-back Matija Nastasic, with Rabbi Matondo, who left the Etihad last month, as a substitute. At a packed and vibrant Veltins Arena, Sergio Ag\u00fcero made a hash of the first chance, mistiming a shot, then a slick free-kick routine that wrong-footed the defence ended in an Ag\u00fcero header being tipped over by Ralf F\u00e4hrmann.

Gayle needed 76 balls for his half-century but just 24 more for three-figures, celebrating his 24th ODI century in typical box office fashion by placing his helmet on the end of his bat and raising it to all quarters. This is Gayle\u2019s final home series before a plan to retire after the summer\u2019s World Cup and he appears keen to milk it. It was not just Gayle and his penchant for smearing Moeen into the Greenidge and Haynes Stand with the trade winds. Darren Bravo\u2019s 30-ball 40 was packed with meaty strikes, while the unlikely Nurse flayed 25 from nine deliveries at the death. This cameo from the No 9 included the last ball for a 23rd six of the innings, surpassing the record West Indies had shipped in 2014 against New Zealand. Figures of three for 37 from eight overs of Stokes thus felt a triumph in the circumstances \u2013 not least the slower ball that Gayle chopped on to his stumps \u2013 while Adil Rashid, curiously held back until the 34th over, also picked up three in a nine-over spell, albeit at a more costly 74 runs. Moeen was taken for 85 from 10 overs, Liam Plunkett, the man to miss out on Gayle\u2019s wicket earlier, leaked 54 from six, and Wood\u2019s second burst included three sixes in his last over. The run chase that followed may have put these returns into context but a question mark over the potency of England\u2019s attack on such roads remains.",

      "body": "<h2>Hugh Jackman</h2> <p>Hugh Jackman opens the show, ahead of a UK tour that starts in May in which he will perform songs from The Greatest Showman, Les Mis\u00e9rables and hopefully a musical theatre version of Hungry Like the Wolf dressed as Wolverine. Cynics will say that this is a shameless ploy to flog tickets to casual ITV viewers, and they would be absolutely right, but The Greatest Showman was the UK\u2019s biggest-selling album in 2018, so it is absolutely right and proper that he is here.</p> <p>He appears atop a pyramid of dinner-jacketed dancers, performing The Greatest Show, whose \u201cwhoa-oh-ohs\u201d are exactly the kind of thing you\u2019d hear in the chorus of a Brit awards-anointed, major label pop prospect. But turned up to an absurd fever pitch: every dial has been twisted to 11 for the Brits 2019 opening.</p> <p>An armchair psychologist could do a fairly quick assessment of our culture off the back of it: we just want maximalist musical entertainment \u2013 of the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/23/bohemian-rhapsody-review-freddie-mercury-biopic-bites-the-dust\">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/17/mamma-mia-here-we-go-again-review-feta-fever-dream-sequel-is-weirdly-irresistible\">Mamma Mia!</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/31/a-star-is-born-review-lady-gaga-bradley-cooper\">A Star is Born</a> \u2013 to deafen the awfulness of everything else in the world. \u201cAustralia\u2019s answer to Bradley Walsh\u201d, as Jack Whitehall bills him, proves the perfectly deafening tonic.</p> <h2>George Ezra</h2> <p>Exuding ruddy-cheeked asexual vigour like a Richard Curtis hero, or one of those butcher\u2019s mannequins come to cheerful life, George Ezra feels like the only thing holding Brexit-era Britain together, by sheer force of his wholesomeness. If the pop-star thing goes south, you can imagine he\u2019d shrug gamely and go off to become a PE teacher and have four kids.</p> <p>He performs Shotgun, up for British single later on this evening, backed by lustrous vistas of Monument Valley. Some extremely supple bass guitar and robust brass back his summer road-trip anthem; if Hugh Jackman\u2019s tactic was, like the Aesop fable, to blow your coat off your back, then Ezra warms up the room to the point where everyone\u2019s ready to not just take off their coats, but skinny-dip in the pool. Shotgun is a blast of pure positive energy that only the churlish, the contrarian and the people who you absolutely never want to be stuck with in the kitchen at a house party hate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cf2bfea6990d258a546c90eea8ebb0d580ac5dfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf2bfea6990d258a546c90eea8ebb0d580ac5dfd/0_0_3500_2212/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Little Mix on stage at the Brit awards 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"632\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Little Mix on stage at the Brit awards 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Little Mix</h2> <p>Little Mix, whose spat with Piers Morgan seems to have sent them into weaponised frenzy of sass, sit like a coven around a table before discarding their pink PVC coats for a marauding take on Woman Like Me. They\u2019re joined by Ms Banks \u2013 who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/the-ones-to-watch-in-2018\">we championed</a> back at the start of 2018 and is standing in for Nicki Minaj; the US rapper co-signed Banks\u2019 magnificent guest verse on Stylo G\u2019s Yu Zimme, in which she announces her intention to absolutely rinse the assets of her boyfriend, a very Little Mix kind of energy.</p> <p>Banks crushes her self-penned verse, bragging of her \u201chips from my mama and attitude from my daddy\u201d, and Little Mix also deliver: all throaty hollers, saucy gyrations and tongue flicks, plus a bombastic martial energy in a glitching, exploding arrangement. Their knackered gasping for breath is audible at the end of the mic: they gave everything, and are rightfully Britain\u2019s best girl band in a generation. Shame they didn\u2019t win best group in a way \u2013 but judging by the fan energy on socials, the public-voted video award will be theirs.</p> <h2>Jorja Smith</h2> <p>Jorja Smith goes from backing up Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man at last year\u2019s awards to getting a slot of her own, and you could make a reasonable case for the Brits helping to nurture her path towards the big time. But then they would, wouldn\u2019t they, given she is distributed by the Orchard, which is owned by Sony, which has been managing the last three years of the Brits. But her commanding choruses and charisma mean she deserves the industry whirring away beneath her, even if her taste for vocal fry is on a par with a particularly disgruntled Los Angeleno tween.</p> <p>Don\u2019t Watch Me Cry is the Britsiest choice she could have made for the Brits: piano breakup ballads have of course, per Adele, been some of the most memorable moments in recent Brits history. Aside from a rogue whoop, the audience is pin-drop quiet for Smith\u2019s commanding performance, though truth be told, she is better at lower-key, bruised performing than this classic vocal showboating \u2013 it would be so much radical to get her to do something like Blue Lights, a claustrophobic crime story, on stage here. But as a bit of palate-cleansing after the bombast of the first few performances, it works perfectly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e98ecc8045fe7ec475fee18796238394c1b6cf6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e98ecc8045fe7ec475fee18796238394c1b6cf6/0_395_5054_3317/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dua Lipa performing One Kiss with Calvin Harris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dua Lipa performing One Kiss with Calvin Harris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Calvin Harris</h2> <p>Medley! The Brits were born for medleys. We kick off with Giant, which to be honest is one of Calvin\u2019s weaker moments: Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone saying \u201cI am\u201d over and over again like a malfunctioning mindfulness app does not a chorus make, and the brass is like an abortive Rudimental studio session heard through a partition wall. But this is a pretty robust rendition, with Harris twisting knobs amid banks of (presumably redundant) analogue synths and generic electronic gear.</p> <p>It segues into Promises, with Sam Smith dressed like a mirrorball being sent through a black hole. Whoever keeps breaking up with him and sending him into boozy nights out full of self-loathing and loneliness, please keep doing it \u2013 it\u2019s giving us some great pop songs (see also Dancing With a Stranger). But it doesn\u2019t seem to faze him: singing ever so slightly flat, he\u2019s joined by Winnie Harlow for some Saturday Night Fever-style dance moves and generally fabulous sashaying. Finally Dua Lipa, ever a fan of a high short, stalks her way around some shrubberies as if lost in the Ibizan hillsides for her performance of One Kiss: the sound of flirty eye contact over a 5pm mojito in Alicante.</p> <p>Altogether it\u2019s a very strong showcase for the Scottish producer\u2019s pop touch. Can we take a minute to hail him? Slide, Blame, We Found Love, Ready For the Weekend, his Spectrum remix, This Is What We Came For and potential Brits winner One Kiss are all in the absolute top tier of pop this country has ever produced. And, Shawn Mendes aside, his underwear advertising remains #goals.</p> <h2>Jess Glynne and HER</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"48271b911ea963ca6478e0c94ad92fe08fd0ef01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48271b911ea963ca6478e0c94ad92fe08fd0ef01/0_0_5000_3271/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jess Glynne and HER.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jess Glynne and HER.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I should perhaps defer to a woman to ascertain how far this performance has pushed global feminism forward, but I would hazard not very much. In a Dove campaign come to life, Jess Glynne, US R&amp;B star HER, and 70 women (including Jess\u2019s mum) all take their makeup off as she performs her song Thursday. According to Jess in a press release we got beforehand, this is \u201ca gesture to remind ourselves and everyone else that it\u2019s okay and we are enough as we are. I hope this moment can help enforce that no woman is alone.\u201d</p> <p>It is enormously well-meaning, and gestures of sisterhood like this \u2013 on a very public stage \u2013 are laudable, even culture-jamming. It certainly beats the staging for your average piano ballad; Jess is in perfect voice, and HER adds a gorgeously improvisatory take on verse two.</p> <p>But just as Dove\u2019s campaigns, beyond their apparent championing of diverse body types, still quietly trade off female insecurity and a valorisation of beauty, this act ends up feeling trite when set amid a night that announces beauty actually IS about glamour and makeup. Point is, if this makes you feel better about yourself as a woman, you\u2019re sitting on a bar that society loves to keep really, really low.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4e2f94881b8ef6f838c0ff8d18906cc7d4edc4fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e2f94881b8ef6f838c0ff8d18906cc7d4edc4fa/1559_603_1328_1215/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matty Healy of the 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"915\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matty Healy of the 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel C Ryan/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The 1975</h2> <p>The 1975 now, fronted by Matty Healy, a pigeon-toed manifestation of the anxieties facing rock stars today.

I was kind of hoping for a ferocious state-of-the-nation performance of Love It If We Made It, but I can\u2019t be mad at someone who shouts out our brilliant deputy music editor Laura in an acceptance speech \u2013 and with a statement of real political importance.</p> <h2>Pink</h2> <p>She may be heading towards her Radio 2 years, but Pink\u2019s image \u2013 the bourbon-slurping tattoo artist ready to give Karen at the other end of the bar a piece of her mind \u2013 still makes her stand out in the pop landscape. In fact, she\u2019s an object lesson in how to be a major label, Brits-friendly artist: doggedly weather the early days when the label has no idea how to package you up, shrug off the inevitable flop records, keep singing songs that empower people out of the sweatpants phase of a breakup, and never forget the importance of Germany as a secondary market.</p> <p>Starting in her dressing gown in her dressing room \u2013 very much part of her #relatable image \u2013 she kicks off with Walk Me Home and is swiftly hoisted into a costume that looks like Big Bird in the climactic scene of Carrie. Up she goes into the heavens, with the flamethrowers from Kanye\u2019s 2015 performance earning back some of their value for Just Like Fire \u2013 a highlight of late-period Pink, thanks to its vocal leaps as vertiginous as her drop to the arena floor. Then it\u2019s into Just Give Me A Reason, in some ways her most melodically satisfying song; Nate Ruess\u2019s part is done (very capably) by Dan from Bastille in the most quintessentially Brit awards moment of this year\u2019s Brit awards.

In fact, she\u2019s an object lesson in how to be a major label, Brits-friendly artist: doggedly weather the early days, when the label has no idea how to package you up, shrug off the inevitable flop records, keep singing songs that empower people out of the sweatpants phase of a breakup, and never forget the importance of Germany as a secondary market.<br></p> <p>Starting in her dressing gown in her dressing room \u2013 very much part of her #relatable image \u2013 she kicks off with Walk Me Home and is swiftly hoisted into a costume that looks like Big Bird in the climactic scene of Carrie. Up she goes into the heavens, with the flamethrowers from Kanye\u2019s 2015 performance earning back some of their value for Just Like Fire \u2013 a highlight of late-period Pink, thanks to its vocal leaps as vertiginous as her drop to the arena floor. Then it\u2019s into Just Give Me Reason, in some ways her most melodically satisfying song; Nate Ruess\u2019s part is done (very capably) by Dan from Bastille in the most quintessentially Brit awards moment of this year\u2019s Brit awards. The medley klaxon has been well and truly sounded.</p> <p>Another recent Brits cliche \u2013 projection mapping \u2013 is deployed for an upbeat take on Try before a change into a newsprint-covered mac for What About Us. It remains an utterly shameless ripoff of Coldplay\u2019s Sky Full of Stars, but remains just as cheesily satisfying. She and her dancers finish by holding lights in a gesture of solidarity for \u2026 what? Well, it doesn\u2019t matter.

When she arrived in 2000, she pulled the curtain back on pop\u2019s machinations (\u201cLA told me you\u2019ll be a pop star / All you have to change is everything you are\u201d), brought grit to a squeaky-clean scene by confronting serious issues through her music and setting out a template of partying on her own terms that would influence much of mid-00s pop. Her Janis Joplin-worthy rasp and tornado-strong vocal power added gravitas to her towering hits, and her own identity as a straight-talking, zero-BS woman learning to deal with life as it comes has never wavered. I\u2019d put money on Pink being the reason that a lot of the young women in this room wanted to be pop stars in the first place.

In a Dove campaign come to life, Jess Glynne, US R&amp;B star HER and 70 women (including Jess\u2019s mum) all take their makeup off as she performs her song Thursday. According to Jess in a press release we got beforehand, this is \u201ca gesture to remind ourselves and everyone else that it\u2019s okay and we are enough as we are.

Whoever keeps breaking up with him and sending him into boozy nights out full of self-loathing and loneliness, please keep doing it \u2013 it\u2019s resulting in some great pop songs (see also Dancing With a Stranger). But it doesn\u2019t seem to faze him: singing ever so slightly flat, he\u2019s joined by Winnie Harlow for some Saturday Night Fever-style dance moves and generally fabulous sashaying. Finally Dua Lipa, ever a fan of a high short, stalks her way around some shrubberies as if lost in the Ibizan hillsides for her performance of One Kiss: the soundtrack to flirty eye contact over a 5pm mojito in Alicante.</p> <p>Altogether it\u2019s a very strong showcase for the Scottish producer\u2019s pop touch. Can we take a minute to hail him? Slide, Blame, We Found Love, Ready For the Weekend, his Spectrum remix, This Is What We Came For and potential Brits winner One Kiss are all in the absolute top tier of pop this country has ever produced.

To sound incredibly like a person who just turned 30, I love that the 1975 feel like an old-fashioned band \u2013 the kind where fans want to read everything they recommend, get tattoos of their lyrics and logos, and create community around. They\u2019re strong advocates for women, and when Matty Healy made questionable comments recently about the state of misogyny in hip-hop, he didn\u2019t double down, but apologised, properly, and promised to educate himself. Not to award medals for basic decency, but his response to the fans who held him to account feels like a positive model for the fan-artist relationship that so many acts take advantage of.</p> <p>Anyway, here they are, looking nicely cleaned up (no more of Matty\u2019s dodgy mohawk) and all having a lovely smooch with their girlfriends.</p> <p><strong>And then \u2026 Oh my god.</strong></p> <p>Matty Healy: \u201cI just want you to listen to me for one sec, just a couple of sentences that a friend of ours, Laura Snapes, said this, and I thought we should all really really think about it.

Some extremely supple bass guitar and robust brass back his summer road-trip anthem; if Hugh Jackman\u2019s tactic was, like the Aesop fable, to blow your coat off your back, then Ezra warms up the room to the point where everyone\u2019s ready to not just take off their coats, but skinny dip in the pool. Shotgun is a blast of pure positive energy that only the churlish, the contrarian and the people who you absolutely never want to be stuck in the kitchen at a house party hate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8bb4ddffca4979d2d9b2e6465c9daa2f1835fa6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8bb4ddffca4979d2d9b2e6465c9daa2f1835fa6/24_0_588_353/500.png\" alt=\"ezra\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-20T20:44:35.422Z\">at 8.44pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c6db827e4b00307e95a7251\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/laura-snapes\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-20T20:28:18.022Z\">8.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">*Brexit joke klaxon*</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Jack Whitehall: \u201cWestlife announced that they were back in the studio.

It\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s going to happen this year, isn\u2019t it? In 2018 we had all the Time\u2019s Up white rose pins and the prospect of artists making vaguely political and/or feminist statements at the podium. Ellie Goulding did one, but later admitted she was told to do (who by, we don\u2019t know), which sort of puts the whole empowering women/continuing to tell women what to do thing in perspective.<br><br>There have been no massive issues going into the Brits this year \u2013 no #BritsSoWhite, no outcry over diversity. The male/female nominations are split precisely 50-50, though BAME artists received only 19 nominations compared with 42 by white acts. Perhaps there\u2019s not been much fuss because \u2026 the Brits commands ever decreasing levels of cultural relevance? Or \u2013 per Drake\u2019s declaration at the recent Grammy awards \u2013 today\u2019s pop acts care less and less about the validation of such industry bodies?

      "bodyText": "Helmed with quickfire wit by Jack Whitehall, it was a Brit awards without any duff performances, and \u2013 in Calvin Harris and Pink\u2019s medleys, plus Little Mix\u2019s propulsive Woman Like Me \u2013 some genuinely great ones. And it\u2019s the first time a Guardian writer has got a mention in an acceptance speech. Thank you for following along \u2013 here are your Brits winners for 2019. British male: George Ezra British female: Jorja Smith British single: Calvin Harris &amp; Dua Lipa \u2013 One Kiss British breakthrough: Tom Walker British group: The 1975 British video: Little Mix \u2013 Woman Like Me (feat Nicki Minaj) International group: The Carters International male: Drake International female: Ariana Grande British album: The 1975 \u2013 A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships British producer: Calvin Harris Critics\u2019 choice: Sam Fender Global success award: Ed Sheeran Outstanding contribution to music: Pink She may be heading towards her Radio 2 years, but Pink\u2019s image \u2013 bourbon-slurping tattoo artist ready to give Karen at the other end of the bar a piece of her mind \u2013 still makes her stand out in the pop landscape. In fact, she\u2019s an object lesson in how to be a major label, Brits-friendly artist: doggedly weather the early days, when the label has no idea how to package you up, shrug off the inevitable flop records, keep singing songs that empower people out of the sweatpants phase of a breakup, and never forget the importance of Germany as a secondary market. Starting in her dressing gown in her dressing room \u2013 very much part of her #relatable image \u2013 she kicks off with Walk Me Home and is swiftly hoisted into a costume that looks like Big Bird in the climactic scene of Carrie. Up she goes into the heavens, with the flamethrowers from Kanye\u2019s 2015 performance earning back some of their value for Just Like Fire \u2013 a highlight of late-period Pink, thanks to its vocal leaps as vertiginous as her drop to the arena floor. Then it\u2019s into Just Give Me Reason, in some ways her most melodically satisfying song; Nate Ruess\u2019s part is done (very capably) by Dan from Bastille in the most quintessentially Brit awards moment of this year\u2019s Brit awards. The medley klaxon has been well and truly sounded. Another recent Brits cliche \u2013 projection mapping \u2013 is deployed for an upbeat take on Try before a change into a newsprint-covered mac for What About Us. It remains an utterly shameless ripoff of Coldplay\u2019s Sky Full of Stars, but remains just as cheesily satisfying. She and her dancers finish by holding lights in a gesture of solidarity for \u2026 what? Well, it doesn\u2019t matter. Sometimes pop just needs to be uplifting. The Bros brothers were among the best-received presenters from the crowd at the Brit awards. And it\u2019s no surprise: their documentary for the BBC, After the Screaming Stops, was a huge Christmas hit. Matt Goss told me: \u201cThe fact it went viral is extraordinary. I think we broke a lot of the BBC records as well. The overwhelming response is that it\u2019s being emotive and connective experience. People have been coming up to me in the street talking about their family, their work, and their loss. The documentary transcended music.\u201d When asked what it was like to be thrown back into the spotlight, Goss said it was a misconception that he was ever really out of it. \u201cFame doesn\u2019t suddenly go away. In the last five days, I did two shows \u2026\u201d When I was faced between the choice of getting a more professional photo for the liveblog or a selfie, I obviously went for the selfie. Pink\u2019s nomination (announced before the awards) felt a bit, \u201cHuh, okay\u201d \u2013 but her legacy, while quiet, is more considerable than you\u2019d think. When she arrived in 2000, she pulled the curtain back on pop\u2019s machinations (\u201cLA told me you\u2019ll be a pop star / All you have to change is everything you are\u201d), brought grit to a squeaky-clean scene by confronting serious issues through her music and setting out a template of partying on her own terms that would influence much of mid-00s pop. Her Janis Joplin-worthy rasp and tornado-strong vocal power added gravitas to her towering hits, and her own identity as a straight-talking, zero-BS woman learning to deal with life as it comes has never wavered. I\u2019d put money on Pink being the reason that a lot of the young women in this room wanted to be pop stars in the first place. (Adele has said as much in the past.) \u201cI\u2019ve been listening to her music my whole life,\u201d Dua Lipa told Jack Whitehall earlier. It\u2019s 16 years since she was last here, she says. \u201cI bet it\u2019s hard for some of you to believe as well, but to be considered in the same category as David Bowie and the Beatles and Sir Elton and Sir Paul and Eurythmics and Fleetwood Mac \u2013 it\u2019s beyond anything my brain can comprehend \u2026 It\u2019s been an awesome journey from busking on the street to playing Dingwalls, to playing Wembley this summer \u2026 It\u2019s been an awesome 20 years. Here\u2019s to 20 more!\u201d The 1975 now, fronted by Matty Healy, a pigeon-toed manifestation of the anxieties facing rock stars today. There\u2019s the existential stuff we\u2019re all going through \u2013 twisted politics, the death of the planet \u2013 plus some rather more particular anxieties, like how it\u2019s simultaneously quite problematic and quite exciting to have women throw themselves into your DMs. And there\u2019s some old chestnuts too, like how nice heroin is. Performing Sincerity is Scary dressed in a woolly hat and headphones over his tuxedo in front of some huge New York brownstones, a la the video, the band smoothly play out the laidback, Chance the Rapper-indebted track. I was kind of hoping for a ferocious state-of-the-nation performance of Love It If We Made It, but I can\u2019t be mad at someone who shouts out our brilliant deputy music editor Laura in an acceptance speech \u2013 and with a statement of real political importance. Khalid was two years old when Pink released her debut album. Another shocker for George Ezra, who \u2013 by his colossal commercial success, at least \u2013 looked set to sweep the night. But the right act won: there\u2019s probably more ambition and diversity in the 1975\u2019s third album than there is across the rest of the night\u2019s nominees combined. Heroin love songs! Weird Siri lullabies! A trop-house banger that somehow managed to revive pop\u2019s most tired micro-genre and make it irresistible again. Obviously I am biased now but give them all the prizes. This time around Matty Healy thanks their manager, his girlfriend (\u201cThank you for letting me write all that stuff down\u201d) and the Arctic Monkeys \u201cfor still being such an inspiring and relevant band in 2019 \u2013 I know how hard that is\u201d. Err didn\u2019t anyone tell Jared that the Greatest Showman bit was at the start of the show? Indeed \u2013 an admirable lack of mid-Atlantic blurring of his Dumfries tones. And while we\u2019re here for reaction gifs we can get behind: Or at least Jack Whitehall\u2019s best attempt at starting some. He plonks himself in the middle of Little Mix\u2019s table to try and get them talking about Piers Morgan, who \u2013 precious snowflake \u2013 managed to agitate himself into a great frothing frenzy over nothing a couple of months back. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like that picture where you stripped off naked \u2026 voluptuous chest and four chins, it must have been like looking in the mirror for him.\u201d Little Mix aren\u2019t ready to go there publicly. \u201cJACK!\u201d Jesy yells. \u201cJesy, what would you say to that dutty wasteman?\u201d Nothing on live TV, it turns out. Another worthy winner! Brits, are you sure you\u2019re feeling okay? One Kiss is *chef\u2019s kiss*, switching snappily between Dua\u2019s inviting, warm-shore verses and the hall-of-mirrors heatwave vibe of the chorus. It is, however, wild that this is Calvin Harris\u2019s first ever win for British single when he\u2019s helmed so many smashes over the past decade. Justice for Feels, his Katy Perry/Pharrell duet. I might defer to actual woman Laura Snapes to ascertain how far this performance has pushed global feminism forward, but I would hazard not very much. In a Dove campaign come to life, Jess Glynne, US R&amp;B star HER and 70 women (including Jess\u2019s mum) all take their makeup off as she performs her song Thursday. According to Jess in a press release we got beforehand, this is \u201ca gesture to remind ourselves and everyone else that it\u2019s okay and we are enough as we are. I hope this moment can help enforce that no woman is alone\u201d. It is enormously well-meaning, and gestures of sisterhood like this \u2013 on a very public stage \u2013 are laudable, even culture-jamming. It certainly beats the staging for your average piano ballad; Jess is in perfect voice, and HER adds a gorgeously improvisatory take on verse two. But just as Dove\u2019s campaigns, beyond their championing of diverse body types, still quietly trade off female insecurity and a valorisation of beauty above all else, this act ends up feeling trite when set amid a night that announces beauty actually IS about glamour and makeup. Point is, if this makes you feel better about yourself as a woman, you\u2019re sitting on a bar that society loves to keep really, really low. ARE THEY RE-ENACTING YOKO ONO\u2019S CUT PIECE? No? Oh. It\u2019s a performance of Glynne\u2019s single Thursday, ie: \u201cI won\u2019t wear makeup on Thursdays.\u201d Babe, it\u2019s Wednesday. I give it two minutes before I get a press release from the microfibre makeup removing cloth they\u2019re all using. (Tbf I have one and it\u2019s very good and environmentally friendly!) So #touching. Calvin Harris recently had his 26th Top 10 single, which puts him joint 11th in singles chart history \u2013 an accolade he shares with Rod Stewart. That is quite a lot of whopping hits, which begs the question of why it\u2019s taken so long for the Brits to actually give him any awards. Let\u2019s get the conspiracy theories going: he once looked at Brits boss Geoff Ellis for too long at the urinals? He is viscerally anti-Britannia and can\u2019t bear the thought of touching the statue? The voting body think he\u2019s cheating because his Scottish heritage is largely overshadowed on his songs by the presence of gigantic US stars? Taylor Swift has orchestrated some sort of elaborate blackmail? Whatever dark forces were at work here have abated, and Harris has his first Brit. And here he is: \u201cI\u2019ve been coming here for a few years and I\u2019ve never got the opportunity to say anything on this stage before\u2026\u201d thank you etc. No woman has ever won this award, and only two have ever been nominated for it \u2013 Kate Bush and Goldfrapp \u2013 which makes for an interesting contrast with Annie Mac\u2019s preamble about how nice it is \u201cto be at a Brits where as many females are nominated as males\u201d. A better shot of that Meghan portrait. Is that some Queen Victoria styling? What does it mean, aside from the fact that she is a queen? How will the Daily Mail report this? How many Guardian commenters will lose it over us mentioning Beyonc\u00e9 again? Questions\u2026 THE OBVIOUS AND WORTHY WINNERS! There\u2019s proper girl-band-ery afoot in this superbly weird video \u2013 dancing atop buses, acting fecklessly in a quasi-academic environment, writhing around on chairs \u2013 and I am here for it. I still have questions about Jesy\u2019s lip liner though. Like, why is there so much of it? A lot of enjoyable high-pitched wailing in their acceptance speech, delivered by Jade Thirlwell: \u201cWe never win this! Oh my god, thank you so much! We have had absolutely no shame in asking people every day to vote for this.\u201d Medley! The Brits were born for medleys. We kick off with Giant, which to be honest is one of Calvin\u2019s weaker moments: Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone saying \u201cI am\u201d over and over again like a malfunctioning mindfulness app does not a chorus make, and the brass is like an abortive Rudimental studio session heard through a partition wall. But this is a pretty robust rendition, with Harris twisting knobs amid banks of (presumably redunant) analogue synths and generic electronic gear. It segues into Promises, with Sam Smith dressed like a mirrorball being sent through a black hole. Whoever keeps breaking up with him and sending him into boozy nights out full of self-loathing and loneliness, please keep doing it \u2013 it\u2019s resulting in some great pop songs (see also Dancing With a Stranger). But it doesn\u2019t seem to faze him: singing ever so slightly flat, he\u2019s joined by Winnie Harlow for some Saturday Night Fever-style dance moves and generally fabulous sashaying. Finally Dua Lipa, ever a fan of a high short, stalks her way around some shrubberies as if lost in the Ibizan hillsides for her performance of One Kiss: the soundtrack to flirty eye contact over a 5pm mojito in Alicante. Altogether it\u2019s a very strong showcase for the Scottish producer\u2019s pop touch. Can we take a minute to hail him? Slide, Blame, We Found Love, Ready For the Weekend, his Spectrum remix, This Is What We Came For and potential Brits winner One Kiss are all in the absolute top tier of pop this country has ever produced. And, Shawn Mendes aside, his underwear advertising remains #goals. If anyone is particularly enjoying the work of breakdancer Jai Hickling, you can see him performing again at Nuneaton\u2019s first ever breakdancing festival, at the Griff and Coton Sports club on 9 March. And gives the most boilerplate, phoned-in acceptance speech of all time. \u201cMeans a lot \u2026 can\u2019t be there \u2026\u201d Snooze. None of them have shown up, but they have sent actual thank-you messages! That\u2019s unexpected. From Ariana Grande (international female) and Drake (international male) but not least from Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, winners of best international group as the Carters, who thank the UK for always being supportive. \u201cEverything is love, thank you,\u201d says Beyonc\u00e9, standing next to Jay-Z in front of a portrait of Meghan Markle \u2013 in what one could interpret as a show of support for the duchess, who has been the subject of vitriolic treatment at the hands of the tabloids. Jorja Smith goes from backing up Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man at last year\u2019s awards to getting a slot of her own, and you could make a reasonable case for the Brits helping to nurture her path towards the big time. But then they would, wouldn\u2019t they, given she is distributed by The Orchard, who are owned by Sony, who have been managing the last three years of the Brits. But because of her commanding choruses and charisma, she deserves the industry whirring away beneath her \u2013 even if her taste for vocal fry is on a par with a particularly disgruntled Los Angeleno tween. Don\u2019t Watch Me Cry is the Britsiest choice she could have made for the Brits: piano breakup ballads have of course, per Adele, made for some of the most memorable moments in recent Brits history. Aside from a rogue whoop, the audience is pin-drop quiet for Smith\u2019s commanding performance, though truth be told, she is better at lower-key, bruised performing than this classic vocal showboating \u2013 it would be so much radical to get her to do something like Blue Lights, a claustrophobic crime story, on stage here. But as a bit of palate-cleansing after the bombast of the first few performances, it works perfectly. Little Mix\u2019s electrifying performance has Emma Bunton, and many others, up on their feet and applauding. Respect from girlband to girlband. Little Mix, whose spat with Piers Morgan has clearly sent them into weaponised frenzy of sass, sit like a coven around a table before discarding their pink PVC coats for a marauding take on Woman Like Me. They\u2019re joined by Ms Banks \u2013 who we championed back at the start of 2018 and is standing in for Nicki Minaj; the US rapper co-signed Banks\u2019 magnificent guest verse on Stylo G\u2019s Yu Zimme, in which she announces her intention to absolutely rinse the assets of her boyfriend, ie a very Little Mix kind of energy. Banks crushes her self-penned verse, bragging of her \u201chips from my mama and attitude from my daddy\u201d, and Little Mix also deliver: all throaty hollers, saucy gyrations and tongue flicks, plus a bombastic martial energy in a glitching, exploding arrangement. Their knackered cardio breathing is audible at the end of the mic: they gave everything, and are rightfully Britain\u2019s best girl band in a generation. Shame they didn\u2019t win best group in a way \u2013 but judging by the fan energy on socials, the public-voted video award will be theirs. A confession: I knew absolutely nothing about Tom Walker until this week my job dictated that I had to know something about Tom Walker. Here\u2019s what I guessed in advance: bad hat. Outsized beard. Big voice. Tender-hearted yet beefy ballads, maybe tarted up with a little au courant synth work. A bit Jack Garratt. A bit Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man, a bit Lloyds TSB advert soundtrack, a bit \u201curban\u201d. Secular bombast, that kind of froggy voice you get when you haven\u2019t quite swallowed your tea properly. READERS, GUESS WHAT. Sadly this is less testament to my brilliant telepathy than it is the utterly predictable shape of Britain\u2019s male pop stars. Anyway, here he is (\u201cYes gran, here we are!\u201d). Obviously this is a much worse acceptance speech than the last one because it doesn\u2019t mention me. In case you missed that, the piece that Matty Healy is referring to, by our very own Laura Snapes, is this brilliantly angry yet clear-headed piece of campaigning journalism. Read it in the next ad break. The nominations for this category are often a bit suspect \u2013 pop groups versus Real Manly Bands. But in the 1975, you have a group that straddles the best of pop and rock \u2013 and ambient, trop house, jazz, We Didn\u2019t Start the Fire reduxes and all the rest of it, just going by their most recent record. To sound incredibly like a person who just turned 30, I love that the 1975 feel like an old-fashioned band \u2013 the kind where fans want to read everything they recommend, get tattoos of their lyrics and logos, and create community around. They\u2019re strong advocates for women, and when Matty Healy made questionable comments recently about the state of misogyny in hip-hop, he didn\u2019t double down, but apologised, properly, and promised to educate himself. Not to award medals for basic decency, but his response to the fans who held him to account feels like a positive model for the fan-artist relationship that so many acts take advantage of. Anyway, here they are, looking nicely cleaned up (no more of Matty\u2019s dodgy mohawk) and all having a lovely smooch with their girlfriends. And then \u2026 Oh my god. Matty Healy: \u201cI just want you to listen to me for one sec, just a couple of sentences that a friend of ours, Laura Snapes, said this, and I thought we should all really really think about it. She said that in music, \u2018male misogynist acts are examined for nuance and examined as traits of difficult artists while women and those who call them out are treated as hysterics who don\u2019t understand art.\u2019\u201d I had no idea that was going to happen. Matty is quoting from the comment piece I wrote about the allegations made against Ryan Adams last week. Exuding ruddy-cheeked asexual vigour like a Richard Curtis hero, or one of those butcher\u2019s mannequins come to cheerful life, it feels like George Ezra is the only thing holding Brexit-era Britain together by sheer force of his wholesomeness. If the pop thing goes south, you can imagine he\u2019d shrug gamely and go off to become a PE teacher and have four kids. He performs Shotgun, up for British single later on this evening, backed by lustrous vistas of Monument Valley. Some extremely supple bass guitar and robust brass back his summer road-trip anthem; if Hugh Jackman\u2019s tactic was, like the Aesop fable, to blow your coat off your back, then Ezra warms up the room to the point where everyone\u2019s ready to not just take off their coats, but skinny dip in the pool. Shotgun is a blast of pure positive energy that only the churlish, the contrarian and the people who you absolutely never want to be stuck in the kitchen at a house party hate. Jack Whitehall: \u201cWestlife announced that they were back in the studio. Suddenly a hard border with Ireland doesn\u2019t sound so bad.\u201d One swig, and a joyful one. Whitehall is really taking names, and I welcome it. I\u2019m quite surprised this didn\u2019t go to Jess Glynne, whose last album was the most successful new British album of last year after George Ezra\u2019s Staying at Tamara\u2019s, but I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t, because \u2026 well, she\u2019s terrible. Florence and Lily getting it somehow never seemed likely as the Brits push towards recognising a newer generation of artists. Anne-Marie is a compelling person but lacks the artistry to make her into a proper pop star, simply representing the most evolved point of the \u201cformer guest vocalist turned pop star\u201d nexus. And so Jorja Smith feels like a good choice: her debut Lost &amp; Found subverted her neo-soul template with its prickly atmosphere and jaded, post-Winehouse relationship lamentations remade for millennials. \u201cThis is for all the little girls and women who are being themselves and loving everything they\u2019re doing,\u201d Smith says, sweetly. HER: \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard, Nile, the future is female.\u201d Humour me for one second and imagine that Aphex Twin had won this. Imagine the malevolent avatar he would have sent to collect the award in his place while he spends the evening at home in Cornwall ignoring the whole thing. The appalled looks on the faces of major label executives as the squirming synths of T69 Collapse writhed around the O2. No? Obviously, rather than reward Richard D James \u2013 prone to impishness, fibs, and full-on disturbing vocals \u2013 the Brits have chosen his polar opposite in George Ezra: rosy of cheek, sweet of nature and deep of voice. His cheery guitar pop (which even I, black of soul, cannot find it within me to hate) dwells firmly in a genre that I like to call Massive In Cornwall, something I\u2019d like to be able to say about local man Aphex Twin, though sadly my petitions for Windowlicker to be adopted as the county\u2019s national anthem have fallen on deaf ears. Anyway, \u201cthe man we all love to love\u2026\u201d seems genuinely bowled over (\u201cOh my!\u201d) to win his first Brit award \u2013 potentially his first of three tonight. Hugh Jackman opens the show, ahead of a UK tour that starts in May in which he will perform songs from The Greatest Showman, Les Mis\u00e9rables and hopefully a musical theatre version of Hungry Like the Wolf dressed as Wolverine. Cynics will say that this is a shameless ploy to flog tickets to casual ITV viewers, and they would be absolutely right, but The Greatest Showman was the biggest selling album in the UK in 2018, and so it is absolutely right and proper he is here. He appears atop a pyramid of dinner-jacketed dancers, performing The Greatest Show, whose \u201cwhoa-oh-ohs\u201d are actually exactly the kind of thing you\u2019d hear in the chorus of a Brit awards-anointed, major label pop prospect. But turned up to an absurd fever pitch: every dial has been twisted to 11 for the Brits 2019 opening. You can do a fairly quick psychological assessment of our culture off the back of it: we all just want to have maximalist musical entertainment, of the likes of Bohemian Rhapsody, Mamma Mia! and A Star is Born, to deafen the awfulness of everything else in the world. \u201cAustralia\u2019s answer to Bradley Walsh\u201d, as Jack Whitehall bills him, proves the perfectly deafening tonic. \u201cIf you like your coffee decaf and your Nando\u2019s lemon and herb, strap in for the Prius of pop\u2026\u201d Jack Whitehall on George Ezra! Who \u2013 in classic nicest-guy-in-rock style \u2013 seems to have taken it well. Ben and I remain blissfully ignorant of what actually happens in The Greatest Showman. My guess: Huge Jackman is the ringmaster of a circus. He is a reserved man, uninterested in human contact, but the animals trust him. He falls in love with a human lady, who is mute, having been raised by wolves. She can only sing, and he only sings to her. A jealous gorilla (Bob) steals her away. Huge and Bob have to fight for her affections. They both die. It turns out that the lady can speak, and that this was all a ruse to let her enact her plan to return the animals to freedom. As she raises the gates on the lions\u2019 cage, she roars: \u201cThis is the greatest show, man!\u201d Fin. Ben\u2019s guess: From snatched snippets in online advertising and children singing in supermarkets, I can surmise that The Greatest Showman features Hugh Jackman playing a man possessed by the ghost of Gene Kelly, forced to hunt down a bearded woman to retrieve his true form, in the Moulin Rouge. Zac Efron co-stars. An incredibly baller move to open your awards ceremony with a spoof of the biggest cultural disaster in recent memory, but kudos Brits! Swimming pigs and blowjob jokes! Amazing. Christine and the Queens, nominated for international female, said she\u2019s encouraged by the gender and racial diversity of the nominees this year. She told me: \u201cIt feels amazing. It feels like women rule this year and the spectrum is really broad. I\u2019m nominated with Cardi B and Ariana Grande and we are all really different women in this industry, but we are trying to be fierce.\u201d She added that the industry was only scraping the surface when it came to women\u2019s equality. \u201cWe are only just starting to understand the struggle. From sound engineers to the artists, positions should be occupied by women. There are still lots of things to do.\u201d And with the arrival of Poppy Jamie \u2013 an \u201centrepreneur focused on creating tools to help people feel happier\u201d \u2013 that marks Shot No 1 (for me, at least) in the drinking game, under \u201cvisual presence of influencer who you couldn\u2019t identify in a life-or-death situation\u201d. Vick Hope, the Capital FM DJ who is the official host for the Brits on YouTube, said she\u2019s relieved to see Ella Mai nominated for breakthrough artist. \u201cShe deserves that and if she wasn\u2019t in that category, I\u2019d be quite upset. She has made one of the most important R&amp;B songs of the last few years. It took her a journey to get that recognition because she\u2019s been doing this, she\u2019s been around, but she\u2019s had to go to America to make that impact. And I don\u2019t want that to be the case, because she\u2019s a brilliant British artist. I want her to have her name here so we can show that she\u2019s flying our flag. I\u2019m so glad she\u2019s being recognised for that.\u201d Hope said she\u2019s thrilled to be covering the Brits. \u201cWhen I was younger, Brits night was a big night and I cared deeply who was going to win the awards, who was going to perform. I used to listen on the radio and used to have all the nominations written down in my look book and write who won each one. I really, really cared. Music for me was a release, an escapism and it was really exciting. I\u2019ve felt very proud of British artists from a young age. It\u2019s a no real brainer to want to be involved in it.\u201d Fresh off the back of winning two Grammys, American R&amp;B singer HER said she was excited to be at her very first Brit awards, where she\u2019ll be duetting with Jess Glynne later on. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to seeing the 1975,\u201d she told me. When asked if the nominations this year were diverse enough, she said yes, but added that she didn\u2019t know all the nominations. \u201cThis is my first time at the Brits. But I am excited to see all the women!\u201d At a nearby table, Giggs was notably absent. When asked where he was, the person sitting beside him shrugged and offered up his main course. Well, rude not to\u2026 Transport for London are up to their usual viral-chasing meme-lordery. Whoever works at North Greenwich underground station surely gets very little work done. Sir David Adjaye\u2019s statue sits at the latter end of the bottle opener to sex toy scale, with a distinctly 50 Shades vibe to its shadowy grey glass. A heavily pregnant Abbey Clancy showing the Meghan Markle-obsessed tabloids what \u201cflaunting\u201d your baby \u201cbump\u201d truly looks like, with admirable commitment. Chicken is on the menu at the Brits tonight, but the caterers seem somewhat stressed that none of the guests are that interested in sitting down and actually eating. Guests have an hour to get through three courses. But as for this Guardian reporter, I\u2019m not saying no to free food... More Bros, auditioning for a paint chart somewhere between \u201cTerracotta Sunrise\u201d and \u201cArizona Mustang\u201d. This might turn into a Bros appreciation liveblog for a while. More arrivals, beginning with Olly Alexander: Cruella de no chill. Lily Allen, presumably paying off her album advance with a witchcraft store on Etsy. Well done to Jorja Smith, for channelling vorticist painting and flapper dresses into what is presumably a comment on the overreaching industry economy of the 1920s. Bros appear to have announced a follow-up to their instant cult-hit documentary, What Happens When the Screaming Stops, which will focus on the making of their new album. Seems like a bit of a Faustian pact but when did this country ever learn to let a good joke lie, eh? I\u2019ve just met Emma Bunton, who said she\u2019s happy and relieved to be a bystander at this year\u2019s Brits awards. When asked whether it was weird to be watching the Brits after the Spice Girls\u2019 iconic 1997 performance \u2013 remember the Union Jack dress? \u2013 she laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s really lovely, and no there\u2019s no pressure. I love it. I get to have a glass of champagne and get to relax.\u201d She said she\u2019s really looking forward to the show\u2019s opening, which will be performed by Hugh Jackman, and excited to see Little Mix and Pink. Oh and her post-Brits tip? \u201cAlways get a McDonald\u2019s on the way home\u201d. Filth. Some more red carpet arrivals, beginning with designer Daniel Lismore, for who lis is most definitely not more. Rules of the game are: if you get the ball in his mouth, it\u2019s 50 points, the inner ring is 20, and the outer is just five. 50p please. At the other end of the spectrum, Hugh Jackman, who didn\u2019t get the memo that this is the Brits where you can dress like a Fifth Element extra and no one bats an eyelid. He\u2019ll be opening the ceremony, presumably with a whole bunch of Greatest Showman pizzazz. The brilliant Brockhampton, a nightmare for the paps trying to fit them all in one frame. They\u2019re who we want to win international group, but the likelihood is sadly low. Lots going on here, it\u2019s a bit like a hipster Where\u2019s Wally. And Florence Welch, who, as ever, looks like Miss Havisham moping about a Peckham co-working space. Aamna Modhin here, the Guardian\u2019s emissary at the event itself, where women are taking the lead in Brit nominations this year: for the second time in the awards\u2019 history, more women than men are up for the night\u2019s biggest prize \u2013 album of the year. Lilah Parsons, television and radio presenter on Heart FM, told me: \u201cIt\u2019s so exciting that women are dominating the shortlist this year. I\u2019m huge fan of Anne-Marie, and she\u2019s got four nominations, and of course Dua Lipa who has had the most incredible ride. I still remember playing her on the radio when she was super new. She\u2019s brilliant and a fantastic performer.\u201d Parsons said she\u2019s particularly excited to see what Jess Glynne manages to pull off this year. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop listening to her album. I think she writes great music with really impressive lyrics. I feel she\u2019s very honest and vulnerable and talks about things you can relate to, but she does it in a way that makes you feel strong. She talks about her insecurities and anxieties, which a lot of us do go through. But I find by listening to her, the way she sings about it, it\u2019s not in a kind of woe is me way, it gives you strength. I do think her music is empowering.\u201d Celebs have been arriving on the red carpet, ahead of the show which starts at 8pm on ITV1. Dua Lipa: when you\u2019ve got a fetish party at 3 but a leaver\u2019s ball at 6. Rudimental, looking like they\u2019re one blood-ink manifesto away from announcing their sex cult. Maya Jama: for all your shower foam needs. Shawn Mendes, who is the kind of handsome that makes mums start saying weird inappropriate things and then trying to brush them off like they\u2019re normal. Paloma Faith looks a bit like one of those cakes where there\u2019s a Barbie doll in the middle and the cake is baked around them, you know the ones? Or perhaps a 70s loo roll holder. Either way. If you have any ideas for drinking game rules, I\u2019m all ears. Last year was potentially so eventful that establishing a game felt like a risk. This year feels a bit more like we\u2019ll need to drink to get through it. Some rules to get us going: \u2022 Calvin Harris wins his first Brit \u2013 one swig (is all it takes) \u2022 Full house for any multiple-nominated artist \u2013 that\u2019s Dua Lipa, Anne-Marie, Jess Glynne, George Ezra, Jorja Smith, the 1975, Calvin Harris, Clean Bandit, Dan Caplen (I\u2019m sorry, who?), Demi Lovato, Florence + the Machine, Little Mix, Macklemore, Rita Ora, Rudimental and Tom Walker = as many shots as they win awards \u2022 Visual presence of influencer who you couldn\u2019t identify in a life or death situation \u2013 one shot (ideally of Flat Tummy Tea paired with mixer of choice) \u2022 Any moment more mortifying than Cheryl and Liam Payne\u2019s table interview last year (\u201cDo you have a safe word?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t stop\u201d) \u2013 three shots (or as many as needed to black out) \u2022 Weak statement about feminist empowerment \u2013 strong slug of ros\u00e9/prosecco/gin out of quirkily branded vessel \u2022 Jack Whitehall enjoying flirtatious banter with Love Island contestant \u2013 slurp of sun-warmed unbranded beer \u2022 Bros performatively fighting when they present an award \u2013 one shot \u2022 Bros\u2019s Matt Goss unleashing torturous metaphor when they present an award \u2013 the letters S.H.O.T.S are so important because they personify the word shots \u2022 One shot for every winner who fails to turn up to collect an international prize \u2022 Any member of the 1975 doing \u201cantics\u201d or going a bit off-piste \u2013 half a bottle, swigged as recklessly fast as possible \u2022 Idles either looking deathly bored or being goaded into naughtiness \u2013 one flaming sambuca A very warm welcome to our 2019 Brits liveblog. It\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s going to happen this year, isn\u2019t it? In 2018 we had all the Time\u2019s Up white rose pins and the prospect of artists making vaguely political and/or feminist statements at the podium. Ellie Goulding did one, but later admitted she was told to do (who by, we don\u2019t know), which sort of puts the whole empowering women/continuing to tell women what to do thing in perspective. There have been no massive issues going into the Brits this year \u2013 no #BritsSoWhite, no outcry over diversity. The male/female nominations are split precisely 50-50, though BAME artists received only 19 nominations compared with 42 by white acts. Perhaps there\u2019s not been much fuss because \u2026 the Brits commands ever decreasing levels of cultural relevance? Or \u2013 per Drake\u2019s declaration at the recent Grammy awards \u2013 today\u2019s pop acts care less and less about the validation of such industry bodies? Hard to say!",

But in the end we did it, we scored three goals away.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cWe never give up. We always want to keep going and keep fighting.

He was left on the bench against the club where he started but then he came off an turned the game with an outrageously good freekick goal. And now he\u2019s wandering around the pitch basking in the warm appreciation of fans who know him well and are happy to see him fulfil his talent even at the cost of their team. He throws his jersey to some lucky punter in the crowd and chats happily to some compatriots.

To a large extent this because of the scarcity goals compared to scores in sports like Basketball or Rugby. This means when a goal is scored the level of excitement is like nothing else. It is no exaggeration to state that when my team scores it is one of the most thrilling moments of my week. VAR jeopardises this as it means fans can never be truly be sure they have scored (or won a penalty, I know this to my cost as a visiting Sheffield Wednesday fan at Stamford Bridge last month). Is it really worth risking what makes football so exciting and unique just for the cause of getting a few more marginal calls \u2018right\u2019?\u201d And the other thing is, it\u2019s not even sure that they are getting more calls right. Ultimately it\u2019s still humans making the decisions and there are many examples of them still getting it wrong after several views. In other news, BT have just reported that the referee wanted to examine the footage of that handball incident himself ... but couldn\u2019t because the pitchside screen malfunctioned.

Thought so. Well Pep Guardiola\u2019s men will be aiming to recreate the success that those two heroes made possible over a decade ago, when City went to Gelsenkirchen and returned with a 2-0 win. Having said that, and all pretences at humility aside, 2-0 is probably the minimum City should seek today against a side who are patently inferior to them and in lousy form, still 14<sup>th</sup> in the Bundesliga despite a slight upswing since the turn of the year. </p> <p>City are not without their own problems \u2013 John Stones, Gabriel Jesus, Fabian Delph and Benjamin Mendy have not been able to travel \u2013 but they have ample resources to cope and arrive in Germany in the sort of form that makes talk of a quadruple perfectly reasonable. Pep Guardiola\u2019s aim, then, will be for his team to do what they did at this stage last season, when they kerplunked Basel 4-0 in the first leg to make the second a doddle. And you can be sure that Leroy San\u00e9 and Ilkay Gundogan will be particularly keen to impress on their returns to their old stomping ground.</p> <p>But football isn\u2019t that simple, is it? Schalke, runners-up in the Bundesliga last season, will do their utmost to defy the odds. And City are not exactly sure things in European competition. And there remains a suspicion that they can be got at, and also that they sometimes they become hypnotised by their own rhythmic passing. Smart gamblers will back an emphatic away win, but the really clever people will keep their money in their pockets and just kick back and watch the show. Action ahoy! </p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt was a great result. We gave the first penalty, we gave the second penalty, we gave the red card, so that is not good. So still we are not ready to fight for the final stages. That is the reality. \u201cWe played good but we lost some easy balls, which you are not allowed to do in this competition. And we conceded two penalties. I am a big fan of Var so I have no problem with that. I think the first and second ones are penalties.\u201d \u201cWe made it difficult for ourselves at times but we stuck together, even when down to 10 men.\u201d About his goal he says he gave the defender \u201ca slight nudge in the back ... and my first touch was good and then when the far corner opened up, I went for it.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe showed what a great bunch of lads we are and what we\u2019re heading towards.\u201d That last bit \u201cwhat we\u2019re heading towards\u201d is quite ominous. Mind you, they\u2019ll have to play better than this to win the Champions League for the first time. But they have so many players who can produce magic at any moment that they\u2019re proper contenders. And they know it. San\u00e9 goal, by the way, looks better with every replay. Every player in the wall jumped high but San\u00e9 got the ball over them all and down again with such fizz and whip that it whizzed into the corner, skimming the inside of the post. The keeper was bewildered (and he was all over the shop for Sterling\u2019s goal later). \u201cThe goal means a lot. I was kind of sad for Schalke, especially for the fans because the atmosphere was amazing again, like it always is here. Schalke did really well, they defended well and made it difficult for them so we have to say \u2018respect\u2019. ... But in the end we did it, we scored three goals away.\u201d \u201cWe never give up. We always want to keep going and keep fighting. We know what quality we have in this team and we always get chances. ... It was not our best game but we scored our goals.\u201d What a lovely story this is for San\u00e9. He was left on the bench against the club where he started but then he came off an turned the game with an outrageously good freekick goal. And now he\u2019s wandering around the pitch basking in the warm appreciation of fans who know him well and are happy to see him fulfil his talent even at the cost of their team. He throws his jersey to some lucky punter in the crowd and chats happily to some compatriots. Even Var couldn\u2019t ruin nice human moments like that. What a result for City! They were expected to win but not like this! They fell behind to two penalties and then had Otamendi sent off and they looked to have run out of ideas. But San\u00e9 equalised with an incredible freekick and then Sterling snatched a late winner. Better teams than Schalke won\u2019t offer them reprieves like this but the nature of this win will do them plenty of good to City\u2019s morale, all the same. 90+5 min: Tempers flare in the dying second and Ederson cops a booking for wading into the fray to protect young Zinchenko. 90 + 2 min: There will be at least three more minutes. Time for another twist in the wild match? What a comeback! Sterling latches on to a long boot upfield by Ederson and prods it first time past the keeper from an acute angle! Ropey defending by Schalke but brilliant persistence and composure by Sterling. What a huge result for City, who looked to be reeling with 10 men! 88 min: Zinchenko\u2019s first contribution is to win a corner for City. It flies across the face of goal but no one is able to apply a killer touch. Schalke substitution: Harit on, Uth off. Man City substitution: Zinchenko on, De Bruyne off. 85 min: Suddenly City are alive again, and San\u00e9 is almost in for another ... but he\u2019s foiled by a terrific tackle by his namesake in the Schalke defence. That\u2019s a sensational freekick! Sane whips an amazing curling shot over the wall and into the top corner. Power and precision and absolutely no chance for the keeper! 84 min: Sterling is brought down about 28 yards from goal, giving City a dangerous freekick. It\u2019s central and several players look like the want a crack at it. 82 min: Are City settling for a narrow defeat here? Or are they still slightly stunned by the situation they find themselves in? They can\u2019t get the ball at the minute and are looking low on zip. 79 min: Guardiola is on his feet on the sideline now, applauding his 10 guys. But Schalke are toying with them for a moment, keeping the ball and making City chase. And the visitors aren\u2019t doing it very effectively. Man City substitution: San\u00e9 on, Aguero off. Go figure. Schalke substitution: Skrzybski on, McKennie off. 76 min: San\u00e9 is warming up. City need him badly. Which is to say, they badly need to diversify their approach. It\u2019s too samey and even one-paced, and Schalke are not in the mood to give away any more gift goals. 74 min: Amid panicked boos from the home crowd, De Bruyne\u2019s curl his shot through the wall, via a couple of deflections. The ball trickles out for a corner. 73 min: San\u00e9 booked for pulling down Bernardo Silva, giving City a freekick right on the edge of the box, a little to the left. De Bruyne fancies it ... 72 min: Walkers hares down the right and then booms a cross all the way over to the far flank. 71 min: Uefa stats show us that City have completed 458 passes so far, so there\u2019s that. City substitution: Kompany on, David Silva off. Guardiola figures he can\u2019t play on with just Fernandinho in central defence so sacrifices a forward. It\u2019s abut staying in the tie at this stage. 68 min: He picks up a second yellow for a rash trip on Burgstaller near half way as Schalke loosely threatened to launch a counter-attack. Oh City! 67 min: City have the ball but can\u2019t do anything with it. De Bruyne tries to inject some thrust with a burst from midfield, but Aguero doesn\u2019t anticipate his pass. 65 min: Still no change from City, in any sense. Schalke substitution: Burgstaller on, Mendyl off 63 min: De Bruyne flips a nice pass in the direction of Sterling, but Caligiuri does well to beat him to it and usher the ball to back to his keeper with his head. 62 min: It\u2019s amazing that Guardiola hasn\u2019t yet introduced San\u00e9 and put Sterling on the left. Bernardo Silva has been on the right so far and not been up to much, and City could do with more width and thrust. 61 min: Play resumes, with both players fit enough to continue. 59 min: A break in play as Serdar and McKennie receive treatment following challenges with De Bruyne and Laporte. 58 min: Sterling crosses low from the let. Bernado Silva goes down in the box and looks up hopefully for a penalty. But San\u00e9 was simply too strong for him. 56 min: Gundogan has a right-footed shot charged down the edge of the area. The ball bounces back to him and he tries a left-footer, which flies wide. 55 min: As previously mentioned, this has become a repeat of City\u2019s match at St James\u2019s Park earlier this season, when they were beaten by Newcastle. Schalke are similarly well organised and dogged, and City are running low on ideas and spark. Still, plenty of time left, and plenty of armoury on the bench for City. So no excuses. 52 min: Aguero collects a pass from Walker, skips past one and then fires wide from 20 yards. Guardiola looks a picture of despair as he slumps into the dugout 51 min: Marvellous interplay between David Silva and Aguero at the edge of the box! But then Aguero takes too long to get a shot off and is dispossessed in the box by an excellent sliding tackle from Nastasic. 50 min: Another City attack fizzles out as five opponents surround Sterling to the left-hand side of the box. 49 min: Uth darts between Fernandinho and Walker and nearly gets on the end of a fetching ball from the right. Fernandinho struggles continue. 47 min: City have come out strong in the second half. De Bruyne unleashes a fierce low curler from 20 yards but has to settle for a corner after it takes a nick off a defender and whizzes wide. \u201cHere is my considered view on Var,\u201d announces Matt Kelcher. \u201cFootball is the world\u2019s most popular sport. To a large extent this because of the scarcity goals compared to scores in sports like Basketball or Rugby. This means when a goal is scored the level of excitement is like nothing else. It is no exaggeration to state that when my team scores it is one of the most thrilling moments of my week. VAR jeopardises this as it means fans can never be truly be sure they have scored (or won a penalty, I know this to my cost as a visiting Sheffield Wednesday fan at Stamford Bridge last month). Is it really worth risking what makes football so exciting and unique just for the cause of getting a few more marginal calls \u2018right\u2019?\u201d And the other thing is, it\u2019s not even sure that they are getting more calls right. Ultimately it\u2019s still humans making the decisions and there are many examples of them still getting it wrong after several views. In other news, BT have just reported that the referee wanted to examine the footage of that handball incident himself ... but couldn\u2019t because the pitchside screen malfunctioned. D\u2019oh! Fernandinho was badly at fault for the second penalty, but the first was more contentious: the shot definitely hit Otamendi\u2019s arm and the official appear to have decided that since the ball travelled about 10 yards before striking him, he should have been able to get out of the way. But the ball was travelling so fast that that\u2019s not necessarily fair. It falls into the \u201cseen them given\u201d category, but those aren\u2019t the ones that are supposed to be overturned by Var. \u201cAre City the Anti-Real Madrid?\u201d asks London Crockett. \u201cOnly able to focus on the domestic cup while looking off the boil in the Champions League?\u201d \u201cFabinho is definitely a better centreback than his fellow Brazilian Fernandinho,\u201d parps Harry Palmer, who has a definite point on this week\u2019s evidence. Meanwhile, Leroy San\u00e9 has to come on up front, I fancy. Remove one of the Silvas and stick San\u00e9 on the left and Sterling on the right. What an extraordinary half. For the first half hour or so it looked like City were going to win at a canter, but then they got sloppy and Schalke punished them. Both penalties were warranted - although the one against Otamendi was on the severe side - and City now look a tad flustered. Do they have the moxie to raise their game, introduce something new or better to their play? 45+4 min: City try to zigzag their way forward but they\u2019re mostly going across the pitch once they reach the final third. They\u2019re not passing with enough speed and imagination to unlock the emboldened hosts. 45+2 min: Schalke have all their players behind the ball as City try to pick a way back into the game. There\u2019s shades of the Newcastle match here now: will City be able to avoid a similar result? 45 min: There will be at least five minutes added on, owing mainly to the stoppage for Var. Bentalebed goes the opposite side to his first one. Ederson dives full-length the right way. But the spotkick is well enough struck and placed to carry on into the net despite the keeper getting a hand to it. City were on Easy Street, now they\u2019re in real bother! How will they react? Fernandinho booked for pulling down San\u00e9 as a freekick was making its way into the area. No quibble with that decision and he\u2019ll miss the second leg, too. 42 min: Uth booked for a late tackle on Gundogan. Otamendi\u2019s yellow card, by the way, means he will miss the second leg. 41 min: City try to get back into their groove. Incidentally, Madonna\u2019s Into The Groove was No1 when Schalke\u2019s manager was born. 39 min: Nothing says \u2018unexpected equaliser\u2019 like a thunderous blast of Europop over the stadium PA system. The former Spurs midfielder keeps his composure after an epic delay and sends Ederson the wrong way! And a booking to Otamendi, to boot! After a three-minute delay, Var reached a verdict. It was undoubtedly handball and evidently the officials have decided that Otamendi should have been able to get his hand out of the way. 35 min: After a lengthy pause during which several replays have presumably been examined, the ref calls both captains together to explain ... something. Nobody in the stands, nor anyone watching on TV, knows what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s a serious flaw. 34 min: Var is being consulted here: a shot from 20 yards by Caligiuri clearly hit the arm of Otamendi in the box. The defender\u2019s arm was by his side and he looked to be trying to get out of the way but the home crowd are demanding a penalty ... 33 min: A handball by Caligiuri gives City a freekick in about 23 yards out, to the left-hand side of the box. De Bruyne curls it over the wall but without enough power to really bother the keeper. 32 min: Bernardo Silva lays the ball to Sterling at the edge of the Schalke area. Sterling tries to curl a sneaky low one into the bottom corner but it\u2019s blocked. 30 min: This is an encouraging period for Schalke. Bentaleb is starting to conjure a little in midfield, and McKennie looks like he could bother Laporte if given more opportunities to run at him. But no goal threat yet to speak of from the hosts. 28 min: Schalke build promisingly, creating a crossing opportunity for Mendyl wide on the left. It\u2019s deflected out for a corner. \u201cIf this keeps up, the home team might as well change their name to Schalke 0-4,\u201d jests Peter Oh. \u201cHave the City fans started a \u2018Are you Chelsea in disguise?!\u2019 chant yet?\u201d 25 min: Uth fires off Schalke\u2019s first shot, a reasonable long-range effort that curls a couple of yards wide of the post. 24 min: Schalke try to gain composure by stringing passes together. But they lose it again in a dangerous position. Sterling and David Silva try to walk it into the net and end up confusing each other. 22 min: Schalke try to pull themselves together to respond to that farcical concession. They wobble forward in numbers, but in a way that makes them look even more vulnerable to City, who\u2019ll be confident of inflicting more damage on the counter. 20 min: That was such a ridiculous way for Schalke to fall behind. Confusion in the Schalke defence allows City to open the scoring in the simplest style! The GErmans seemed to think play should have stopped because Uth went down under an aerial challenge by Laporte at the far end of the pitch. But they didn\u2019t put the ball out, instead just stroked it about casually. City nicked it off Sane at the edge of the home box and David Silva then squared it to Aguero, who rolled into an empty net from six yards! 16 min: De Bruyne unloads one from 15 yards. He connection was beautiful and the ball fairly fizzed through the air ... but straight into the arms of the keeper. 15 min: Having survived the early onslaught from City, Schalke are starting to assert themselves a little. Caligiuri, for one, looks far more comfortable heading forward. 14 min: Laporte tries to shepherd a long ball out of play but McKennie is quicker than he realised and races around him to nick the ball at the byline. Laporte goes down to suggest he was pulled back by the American, and the ref falls for the oldest trick in the book. 13 min: Guadiola is still shouting commands from the sideline. It looks like he\u2019s ordering is players to pass with even more tempo in an effort to further unhinge the home team\u2019s packed defence. 12 min: Nastastic hurls himself in front of a shot from 20 yards by Aguero, deflecting the ball out for a corner. It\u2019s incessant pressure from the visitors. 11 min: Aguero receives the ball on the edge of the area with his back to goal and eight opponents between him and the net. He knocks it back to David Silva and City eventually work it wide to Sterling on the left. This time the cross is inaccurate. 9 min: Schalke nearly get into the City box! Bentaled won the ball in midfield and launched an enthusiastic counter, but the cross from the left was deflected out of play by Uth before it even reached the box. 7 min: Caligiui is not a natural defender and is struggling has a right-back against Sterling, who\u2019s beaten him every time he\u2019s gone at him so far. Except this most recent time, because Caligirui fouled him. City work the resultant freekick well before Bernardo Silva centres for Aguero. A lovely header by the Argentinian from eight yards forced the keeps to punch over the bar for another corner. 5 min: Sterling and David Silva combine slickly down the left before the former tries to pick out Aguero with a low pass into the middle. Nastasic puts it out for a corner. 4 min: Fahrmann hurtles off his line and then slides in at the feet of Aguero to clear out for a throw-in. 3 min: City have already taken up residence deep in the Schalke half. You get the feeling this is going to be the pattern for the rest of the game. Uth is all on his lonesome up front for Schalke and the ball hasn\u2019t been anywhere near him yet. 2 min: Commentating on BT, Martin Keown says we should \u201cexpect a wondershow from City\u201d. De Bruyne nearly delivers right on cue, pinging a lovely pass from deep to Aguero, who just fails to get it under control in the box. 1 min: Schalke, in \u201croyal blue\u201d, kick off. City, in sky blue, quickly win possession. As the the teams do the pre-match handshakes, it\u2019s clear that Schalke are significantly bigger than City. No wonder Guardiola mentioned their physicality and setpieces being among their most dangerous threats. The Champions League jingle is loudly booed. Sounds like more than just the City fans. There\u2019s a giddy atmosphere in the stadium, complete with all those lovable staples of German grounds: booming chants, huge cartoons on flags, and fans with glasses of foaming beer and denim jackets covered in back patches. He warns about Schalke\u2019s \u201cphysicality, quality, set pieces\u201d and says \u201cif you let them run, it\u2019s difficult to control them ... but we will try to impose our good things.\u201d Asked about the possibility of winning trophies this season and maybe even four of them, he replies: \u201cThis kind of question we will accept in May. But in January and February it is silly. Because in one week you can lose everything. We are in a good position but three bad results in a row and ...\u201d Schalke\u2019s manager, Domenico Tedesco, was born in 1985. He is three days younger than Luka Modric. He has never known a world in which Duran Duran are top of the British charts and Aston Villa are kings of Europe. None of Schalke\u2019s starters are on a yellow card going into this game. For City, the following three will miss the second if they get booked here: Fernandinho, Otamendi, Aguero. But they\u2019d best not get (caught getting) carded deliberately if they get into a commanding first-leg lead, otherwise they\u2019d be at risk of copping a similar suspension to the one given out last year to Real Madrid\u2019s Carvajal, which may or may not have escaped the attention of dear old Sergio Ramos. It looks like Schalke are deploying a five-man defence, while City\u2019s lineup suggests that Guardiola is using Fernandinho in central defence - or rather as a centreback who can become an extra midfielder if City want to put on a big push. The Brazilian played the role very well against Arsenal earlier this season. Laporte, rather than Zinchenko, will probably be at left-back. Leroy San\u00e9, meanwhile, is parked on the bench on his return to the club where he began his career. Schalke 04: Fahrmann; Caligiuri, Bruma, San\u00e9, Nastasic, Oczipka; Serdar, Bentaleb, McKennie; Uth, Mendyl Subs: N\u00fcbel, Rudy, Matondo, Kutucu, Burgstaller, Harit Man City: Ederson; Walker, Fernandinho, Otamendi, Laporte; Gundogan, De Bruyne, D Silva; B Silva, Aguero, Sterling Subs: Muric, Danilo, Kompany, San\u00e9, Mahrez, Zinchenko, Foden Referee: C Del Cerro Grande (Esp) Hands up if the first things that come to mind when considering Man City\u2019s trip to Schalke are the glory days of Stephen Ireland and Benjani Mwaruwari? Thought so. Well Pep Guardiola\u2019s men will be aiming to recreate the success that those two heroes made possible over a decade ago, when City went to Gelsenkirchen and returned with a 2-0 win. Having said that, and all pretences at humility aside, 2-0 is probably the minimum City should seek today against a side who are patently inferior to them and in lousy form, still 14th in the Bundesliga despite a slight upswing since the turn of the year. City are not without their own problems \u2013 John Stones, Gabriel Jesus, Fabian Delph and Benjamin Mendy have not been able to travel \u2013 but they have ample resources to cope and arrive in Germany in the sort of form that makes talk of a quadruple perfectly reasonable. Pep Guardiola\u2019s aim, then, will be for his team to do what they did at this stage last season, when they kerplunked Basel 4-0 in the first leg to make the second a doddle. And you can be sure that Leroy San\u00e9 and Ilkay Gundogan will be particularly keen to impress on their returns to their old stomping ground. But football isn\u2019t that simple, is it? Schalke, runners-up in the Bundesliga last season, will do their utmost to defy the odds. And City are not exactly sure things in European competition. And there remains a suspicion that they can be got at, and also that they sometimes they become hypnotised by their own rhythmic passing. Smart gamblers will back an emphatic away win, but the really clever people will keep their money in their pockets and just kick back and watch the show. Action ahoy!",

Harris may be the highest-paid DJ in the world, with a reported \u00a337m in earnings last year and collaborations with Katy Perry, Ariana Grande, Rihanna and Pharrell Williams, but Brit award success had eluded him until now. Following 14 unsuccessful nominations, he finally triumphed with both British producer and British single for One Kiss, his UK No 1 with Dua Lipa.

Lipa\u2019s recognition for One Kiss follows her success at the 2018 Brits, which named her British female and breakthrough artist. Harris, 35, grew up in Dumfries, and worked as a shelf-stacker in Marks &amp; Spencer before his music career gradually took off, with his first Top 10 hit coming in 2006.

The 1975 took home the night\u2019s most prestigious award for British album of the year, for A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships, a glossy, ambitious record that took stock of topics including Donald Trump, heroin addiction and 21st-century sex. They also won British group, having previously won in 2017, preventing Arctic Monkeys from winning the award for a fourth time \u2013 a tally that only Coldplay have achieved. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z threatened to steal their thunder, though, with a much-discussed statement as they accepted the award for best international group for their collaborative project The Carters. Replicating a scene from their video Apeshit, they posed in front of a portrait of Meghan Markle styled as Queen Victoria \u2013 an emphatic show of support for the duchess amid sustained press scrutiny. Neo-soul singer Jorja Smith \u2013 one of the night\u2019s only non-white British winners \u2013 underlined her rising-star status by winning British female, beating more established names such as Florence + the Machine and Lily Allen. She previously won the media-voted critics\u2019 choice award in 2018, won this year by 24-year-old Tyneside singer-songwriter Sam Fender.

Essex pop singer Anne-Marie, whose hit song 2002 was co-written by Sheeran, had the joint highest number of nominations with Lipa on four, but couldn\u2019t convert any into wins. Another public vote, for British video, went to girl group Little Mix for their collaboration with Nicki Minaj, Woman Like Me. They were joined by British rapper Ms Banks for their own Brits performance, with Smith, the 1975, Jess Glynne, HER, and outstanding contribution award winner Pink among the other performers \u2013 the latter delivering a barnstorming, flamethrower-fringed medley of five songs. Also performing live was George Ezra, whose album Staying at Tamara\u2019s was the second biggest selling of 2018 behind the soundtrack to The Greatest Showman, whose star Hugh Jackman opened the ceremony. Some speculated Ezra would win all three of his nominations; in the end he made do with the British male award \u2013 an improvement on 2015, when he was nominated four times in his breakthrough year but lost out on all counts. In the international categories, the aforementioned Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z project the Carters won best group, Ariana Grande won best female, and Drake best male. Aside from the video and breakthrough categories, the awards are voted for by the Brits academy, a group of artists and professionals from the music and media industries. In 2016, following outcry over the almost entirely white winners of that year\u2019s awards, the academy admitted 700 new members, bringing BAME representation to 24% and a near-equal gender split to the previously 70% male voting group. Christine and the Queens, nominated for international female, said she was encouraged by the gender and racial diversity of the nominees this year, telling the Guardian: \u201cIt feels amazing. It feels like women rule this year and the spectrum is really broad. I\u2019m nominated with Cardi B and Ariana Grande and we are all really different women in this industry, but we are trying to be fierce.\u201d She added that the industry was only scraping the surface when it came to women\u2019s equality. \u201cWe are only just starting to understand be struggle. From sound engineers to the artists, positions should be occupied by women. There are still lots of things to do.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s deputy music editor Laura Snapes was namechecked by Matty Healy of the 1975 in their acceptance speech. Healy quoted a line she had written about misogyny in the music industry: \u201cI thought we should all really, really think about it. She said that in music, \u2018male misogynist acts are examined for nuance and examined as traits of difficult artists while women and those who call them out are treated as hysterics who don\u2019t understand art.\u2019\u201d Full list of winners British male: George Ezra British female: Jorja Smith British single: Calvin Harris &amp; Dua Lipa \u2013 One Kiss British breakthrough: Tom Walker British group: The 1975 British video: Little Mix \u2013 Woman Like Me (feat Nicki Minaj) International group: The Carters International male: Drake International female: Ariana Grande British album: The 1975 \u2013 A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships British producer: Calvin Harris Critics\u2019 choice: Sam Fender Global success award: Ed Sheeran Outstanding contribution to music: Pink",

Atl\u00e9tico were denied by their city rivals Real in 2014 and 2016; Juve were downed by Barcelona in 2015 and Real in 2017. Only one of them will still have the chance to right those wrongs after this tie is over.</p> <p><strong>Atl\u00e9tico will be especially desperate to reach the final again, because this season it\u2019s going to be played at their very own Estadio Metropolitano. </strong>Diego Simeone\u2019s team aren\u2019t going into this tie in the best form, having won just four of their last nine matches in all competitions. But it\u2019s not all bad news. Antoine Griezmann has smoking-hot boots right now, with ten goals in his last 11 appearances. <em>Los Colchoneros</em> - the reigning Europa League champs - have won their last eight European matches at home. They\u2019re unbeaten in 12 home Champions League matches. And they\u2019ve won their last five home games against Italian teams. Plenty to go on there.</p> <p><strong>Juve\u2019s patchy record against Spanish teams will also give Atl\u00e9tico heart.</strong> The <em>Bianconeri</em> have won only three of their last nine matches in Spain (albeit both of the last two, against Real Madrid and Valencia). In total, they\u2019ve lost 16 of 28 away games against teams from La Liga. But then their current form is where they\u2019ll draw inspiration. Massimiliano Allegri\u2019s men are still unbeaten in Serie A, while Cristiano Ronaldo has already celebrated 21 goals in Juve\u2019s zebra stripes, some return for the 34-year-old seeing he\u2019s only played 32 matches. It really depends how you look at it.</p> <p><strong>Both defences are mean as hell, so this may be tense rather than thrilling. </strong>Then again, everyone expected a goalfest at Anfield last night, and look what happened there. So here\u2019s hoping we witness a few flying in, as two European giants go toe to toe for a place in the quarter-finals of the 2018-19 Champions League. It\u2019s the 1974, 2014 and 2016 runners-up versus the 1985 and 1996 winners! It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off:</strong> 8pm GMT, 9pm local.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-20T17:05:49.056Z\">at 5.05pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Sid Lowe was at the Metropolitano this evening. Here\u2019s the great man\u2019s take on a fine Atletico performance. Thanks for reading! Nighty night! That was a huge second-half performance by Diego Simeone\u2019s side. Diego Costa missed a sitter; Antoine Griezmann hit the crossbar; Alvaro Morata had a goal chalked off by VAR for his part in a very light physical exchange with Giorgio Chiellini; and they finally made the pressure tell, Jose Maria Gimenez and Diego Godin scoring two late crucial goals. Juventus had no answer. Their long wait for European Cup number three looks like continuing ... unless they can pull off a stunning comeback in Turin in three weeks time. And that\u2019s a tall order against a side so defensively resolute as Atletico. And that\u2019s a deserved victory for Atletico, who were sensational in the second half. Not least because they could have lost the head after being denied a goal by a miserable VAR decision. Instead they hit Juve with two late goals to take a huge advantage to Turin! They celebrate accordingly, as Ronaldo trudges off in deep contemplation. 90 min +3: Can, deep on the right, sends a lovely diagonal ball towards Ronaldo, on the left-hand edge of the Atletico six-yard box. Ronaldo rises high, but can\u2019t keep the ball down, and he eyebrows it harmlessly over the bar. The home fans enjoyed that immensely! 90 min +1: In the first of four added minutes, Atletico clear the resulting corner with ease, then break upfield. Lemar wastes a glorious chance from the edge of the Juve box, blazing over when he had to work Szczesny at the very least. 90 min: Ronaldo takes the free kick. It\u2019s a really tight angle, near the byline. He\u2019ll not shoot, will he? No! He pulls it back to the edge of the box for Bernardeschi, who sends a first-time pearler towards the top left. But Oblak, at full stretch, turns it over! 89 min: Alex Sandro probes down the left. Just as he\u2019s about to enter the box, Griezmann slides in to dispossess him. But the Atletico striker\u2019s taken some of his man, so that\u2019s a booking and a free kick just outside the area. 87 min: A free kick for Juve out on the left. Bernardeschi takes, swinging it into a packed box. It\u2019s cleared, and for a second it looks like Lemar will tear off at speed down the right on the counter, Juve light at the back. But he trots down a cul-de-sac. 85 min: Joao Cancelo comes on for Blaise Matuidi. Ronaldo blooters an ambitious effort over the bar. \u201cSack it off,\u201d writes Sean Moore, who can vote for me by proxy. Juve are really reeling now! A free kick out on the right is hoicked into the mixer by Griezmann. Mandzukic, facing his own goal, tries to hook clear, but only sends the ball towards Godin, on the right-hand corner of the six-yard box. Godin flicks goalwards from a tight angle, the ball breaking off Ronaldo and into the net. I think it was going in anyway, but try taking it off Godin if it wasn\u2019t! 81 min: Juve are reeling. Griezmann wins a corner with a bustling run down the right. One corner leads to another, and the Italian champions eventually clear. But the mood has changed in the Metropolitano now, with the home fans finally having something to celebrate, and the visitors are on the back foot. 80 min: Juve wanted the ref to go to VAR there, but he wasn\u2019t having any of it. Massimiliano Allegri responds by hooking Paulo Dybala and sending on Federico Bernardeschi. Lemar swings the corner into the mixer. Morata wins a header. Mandzukic tries to flick clear but the ball slams off the prone Bonucci and sits up for Gimenez, who slams home from the middle of a melee, into the bottom left! No more than Atletico deserve! 77 min: A free kick out on the right for Atletico. Griezmann stands over it, the box loaded. He swings it long. It\u2019s half cleared, allowing Lemar to shoot from just outside the area. It deflects out for a corner on the left. From which ... 76 min: Emre Can has come on for Miralem Pjanic, by the way. 74 min: Morata is fuming. He\u2019s baring his teeth in anger. That decision was very generous towards Juve. And it took a good couple of minutes to make. Clear and obvious? VAR needs work. Or maybe sacking off. You decide. 72 min: NO GOAL! Atletico Madrid 0-0 Juventus. Morata has been judged to have pushed Chiellini in the back just before heading home. There wasn\u2019t much in it, Chiellini having gone down very easily, but the referee\u2019s decided to rule it out. That\u2019s a tight decision, bordering on poor. Atletico are livid, and you can\u2019t really blame them. 70 min: GOAL? Atletico Madrid 1-0 Juventus (Morata 70). What a header this is! A throw on the right. Saul slips a pass left towards Lemar, who then finds Felipe Luis on the left wing. A sensational cross finds the head of Morata, on the penalty spot. Morata powers a header into the top left, Szczesny rooted to the spot! But it\u2019s going to VAR! 69 min: Rodri sprays a pass to Griezmann on the right. He races towards the box, then one-twos with Correa. For a second, he\u2019s sure to burst through for a shot. But Chiellini comes out of nowhere to close the door. 67 min: Here comes that final Atletico change. Koke, returning from injury, hasn\u2019t been able to complete the 90. Angel Correa comes on in his place. 65 min: Juve are bossing the possession. The home crowd don\u2019t like it. A lot of whistling. As a result it looks as though Atletico are preparing their final substitution of the evening. Meanwhile here\u2019s Matt Dony, re Ronaldo\u2019s projection on 49 minutes. \u201cThe psychology of footballers, especially forwards, being able to shift blame for their mistakes somewhere else is fascinating and important. They are generally the most \u2018confidence-dependent\u2019 players, and they need to have a confidence in their own abilities. So, if something goes wrong, they need to shift the blame to, say, the pass that came in to them, or a bobble on the pitch, or a lucky defender. Arsenal\u2019s psychologist used to test for this ability and quantify it. Unsurprisingly, Lord Bendnter\u2019s results were off the scale, dwarfing even Henry\u2019s.\u201d 63 min: Pjanic sees a long-range shot deflected out for a corner on the right. Oblak punches clear. Lemar then makes his first contribution, an absurd slice miles into the sky that goes back towards trouble. It\u2019s going to be another corner, but the ref\u2019s spotted Alex Sandro\u2019s arm flailing in Koke\u2019s grid, so it\u2019s a free kick and the pressure released on Atletico. 62 min: A purposeful run by Morata down the middle, with Juve backtracking. He slips the ball wide left for Griezmann, who in turn feeds Koke. But the momentum\u2019s gone, and the move peters out. 61 min: Atletico make their second change. Thomas Lemar comes on for Thomas. 59 min: Ronaldo knocks the ball way in front of himself down the left, hoping to win a footrace with Gimenez. He does, and for a second he looks like getting a shot away from a tight angle just inside the box, but Godin comes across to nick the ball clear. Corner, which leads to nothing. Ronaldo still has a pair of jets in his boots, despite his advancing years. 57 min: Diego Costa is replaced by Alvaro Morata. That\u2019s the last Juve will see of the big man in this tie. 55 min: The corner comes to nothing, though Atletico appeal for a penalty when Ronaldo\u2019s clearing header scrapes the shoulder of Mandzukic. Then Alex Sandro clatters into Gimenez while contesting a 50-50 out on the wing. It looks accidental, but the ref books the Juve man, who\u2019ll miss the second leg. 53 min: Griezmann Deserves Better pt.II! He chases a neat Koke flick down the inside-left channel and dinks a shot over Szczesny. It\u2019s surely going in. But Szczesny gets a fingernail to the ball, and diverts it onto the crossbar! The rebound\u2019s cleared, put over by Chiellini. What an effort by Griezmann! But what a save! 52 min: That was an awful shank of a finish, taking up a clump of turf. Such a shame, because Griezmann\u2019s through ball was exquisite. It deserved better. 50 min: What a miss by Diego Costa! Griezmann latches onto a poor Chiellini header in the centre circle. He plays a delicately weighted first-time ball down the middle to release Costa. The striker reaches the area, opens his body, and ... sidefoots badly wide to the right. What a clunking finish. He was berating himself the second it left his boot. 49 min: Matuidi bustles in from the left, refusing to give up as he\u2019s knocked off balance. He slips a pass to Ronaldo on the right. Ronaldo wings the ball miles over the bar, then looks around as though it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s fault. Although to be fair, he\u2019s got plenty of credit in the moral bank when it comes to shooting. 47 min: A scrappy start to the half. But suddenly Alex Sandro bursts down the left, then feeds Ronaldo, who crosses deep. Pjanic tries to skelp home, but his effort is deflected out for a corner that comes to nothing. Here we go again! Atletico get the ball rolling for the second half. There have been no changes at the break. Juve had kept the hosts waiting, and Simeone wasn\u2019t too happy, tapping his watch, the internationally recognised mime for Hurry Up You Tardy Buggers. The ref couldn\u2019t give two hoots. Half-time entertainment: Marina Hyde v Gordon Taylor? There\u2019s only going to be one winner. And that\u2019s the end of a hotly contested first half. Ronaldo went close with a free kick. The hosts were inches away from being awarded a penalty, but VAR said no. Apart from that, it\u2019s been the tight tussle we expected. Entertaining enough, though, and with Simeone shaking his head in anger at some perceived slight as the whistle went, expect his team to be fully competitive when they reappear. 45 min +3: Thomas goes in hard on Dybala, who is going nowhere in the middle of the park. That\u2019s a no-brainer booking, in more ways than one, and that\u2019s another Atletico player who\u2019ll be missing in the second leg. 45 min +1: Nope. It\u2019s easily dealt with. Koke blooters clear ... right into poor De Sciglio\u2019s startled coupon! Ooyah, oof, that\u2019s gotta hurt. The Juve defender goes down, to be revived by the magic sponge. 45 min: Alex Sandro dribbles down the left and purchases a corner off Godin. One last chance for a first-half goal. 44 min: A feisty half is petering out. 42 min: Ronaldo is down holding his left ankle, Saul Niguez having stood on his foot. For a second, it looks serious as Ronaldo raises his arm and remains prone. But the referee\u2019s not having a bar of it, and eventually Ronaldo sits up in a huff. He\u2019s not getting the decision, but at least he\u2019s not injured. 40 min: Mandzukic and Dybala ping the ball back and forth between each other down the right. They nearly open Atletico up, but Thomas is wise to their grift and closes down the space just as Dybala threatens to nip into the area and shoot. 38 min: Juve spend the best part of two minutes stroking it around the middle of the park. The home fans aren\u2019t impressed, and whistle accordingly. On the touchline, Simeone is getting agitated, jabbering in the fourth official\u2019s lugs. Costa, who wants to watch himself having already been booked, joins the philosophical debate. A pleasing edge to this match. 36 min: Griezmann shoots from distance. A big deflection earns a corner on the left. Koke takes. Rodri gets too much on a near-post flick-on, and the ball sails over the bar. 34 min: Then suddenly Dybala bursts into a little space down the inside-left channel. He pearls a shot towards the bottom right from 25 yards, but it\u2019s off target and Oblak claims it with ease anyway. 33 min: Juve stroke the ball around as whistles continue to ping around the Metropolitano. For the first time since the kick-off, there\u2019s something of a lull. 31 min: The crowd are beyond livid, as you\u2019d imagine from such a borderline VAR decision. It looked the right one, though there wasn\u2019t a great deal in it. The fans holler and hoot as Ronaldo clatters into Juanfran; no booking. Then Costa is flagged offside as he chases after a long ball down the left. The linesman gets an earful. He\u2019s on a rolling boil now, a bain-marie of belligerence. 29 min: Atletico fume awhile. Then Griezmann pings the free kick, right on the line at the left-hand corner of the box, towards the top left. Szczesny makes a song and dance of pushing it round the post, then Juve tidy up the corner without any fuss. 27 min: Koke bursts down the middle of the park at speed. He slips a pass down the inside-left channel for Diego Costa, who pushes the ball forward and races after it. De Sciglio clips Costa\u2019s heel. Costa goes over in the area. The ref points to the spot. But then the penalty\u2019s overturned by VAR, with the initial contact having been made outside the box. Just a free kick, then. 25 min: Griezmann nearly sends Juanfran away down the right. The full back would have been in acres, but the pass wasn\u2019t all that and Alex Sandro is able to do enough to put a stop to his gallop. That\u2019s a good chance to worry Juventus spurned. 23 min: Ronaldo slips a pass wide left for Alex Sandro, who crosses high. Mandzukic rises highest and hopes to send a header into the top left, but the ball sails harmlessly over the crossbar. 21 min: Atletico pin Juve back awhile. A bit of head tennis in the box. Eventually the ball lands on terra firma and Koke backheels down the inside-right channel in the hope of cutely finding Griezmann. It\u2019s very close to being brilliant, but the ball takes a little deflection away from the striker that allows Szczesny to snaffle. 19 min: Bentancur nearly plays Chiellini into trouble with a loose backwards pass, Griezmann sniffing around. But the defender is alert to the danger and stands firm. Juve go up the other end, Mandzukic nearly making room for a shot on the edge of the box. Not quite. This is a proper battle, and highly entertaining. 17 min: Dybala is this close to sending Ronaldo away down the right wing with a quarterback\u2019s pass from deep. But Godin reads it well to make a crucial interception. Suggestions of handball by the defender, but the referee waves play on. 15 min: Thomas sends a speculative effort towards the bottom-left corner of the Juve goal from 25 yards. It\u2019s a proper no-nonsense belt, and Szczesny goes very well to get down and smother the fierce daisycutter. This is great fun. 13 min: A free kick for Atletico near the centre circle. Griezmann floats it in long, and wins a corner, the ball skimming off the head of De Sciglio. From the corner, Juve break upfield, Dybala nearly rounding the last man Juanfran. But the ball rears up onto his arm, and the ref blows for a free kick. Atletico once again collectively pressure the ref to issue a yellow card. They\u2019re on one tonight. 12 min: Ronaldo has another look at goal, this time from distance out on the right. It\u2019s deflected out for a corner. The set piece finds the head of Bonucci, ten yards out. He\u2019s got to score, but he sends his effort over the bar. This has been some start; this match promises to be some ride. 10 min: Costa\u2019s lid is rattling, the inside of his head a pressure-cooker just desperate to boil over. He gets right up in the referee\u2019s grille when he\u2019s tripped in the midfield by Matuidi. He\u2019s demanding retribution but the ref\u2019s not interested. Costa needs to simmer down. Let\u2019s see if he lasts the evening, me old soccer-loving pals. 9 min: Ronaldo, made irritable by waiting, pelts a sensational rising free kick towards the top left. It\u2019s heading in, a real heatseeker, but Oblak sticks up a strong arm to turn it over the bar. The corner is a non-event. 8 min: Ronaldo trots up to belt the free kick goalwards, but it\u2019s a false start, because Diego Costa had encroached. That\u2019s a ludicrous booking that means he\u2019s out of the second leg! What top-notch buffoonery. 7 min: Ronaldo, formerly of local concern Real, is getting all sorts of pelters from the home crowd. As you\u2019d expect. The whistling nearly takes the roof off as he skitters down the inside-left channel. He\u2019s barged over by Gimenez, and that\u2019s a foul 30 yards from goal. Ronaldo opens his legs, sets himself, and you know what comes next. 5 min: Griezmann dinks the ball past a couple of static Juve midfielders and runs into an awful lot of space down the inside-left channel. He should probably take a shot upon reaching the edge of the box, but tries to find Costa with a cute diagonal pass. It\u2019s not accurate enough and Szczesny gathers without fuss. 4 min: Atletico come at Juve again, Costa winning a corner out on the right. The resulting set piece is a complete waste of time, sent straight out of play by Koke, but this is an impressive fast start by the hosts. 2 min: They\u2019re not getting one, even after a check with the old VAR. The referee limits himself to bollocking the Atletico captain Godin for arguing the point a wee bit too forcefully. 1 min: Juve send the ball long from kick-off, and it\u2019s in the hands of Oblak, who launches it back upfield. Costa flicks on. Griezmann nearly gets the better of Chiellini, but not quite. The ball is knocked out for a throw on the left, from which Griezmann shoots from the left-hand edge of the box. It\u2019s wide and high, but he\u2019s caught by Matuidi. There doesn\u2019t look to be much in it, but Atletico surround the ref demanding a penalty. And we\u2019re off! Juve get a boisterous party started. This is a sensational atmosphere, in a gorgeous stadium. European football at its very best. The teams are out! They\u2019re a bit behind schedule, after some interminable faffing around in the tunnel, but never mind, there\u2019s still magnificent atmosphere at the Metropolitano! The place is bouncing. Atletico are in their ... we\u2019ve covered this. We\u2019ll be off in a minute, but in the meantime, a few wise words from Ciaran Crowther: \u201cI think the winner of this tie stands a great chance of winning the Champions League, surprised so many pundits are discounting both of these teams in favour of serial chokers like PSG or Man City. As they say in American football: offense wins games, defense wins championships. And you could certainly say both of these teams have championship-winning defences as well as some proper firepower going forward.\u201d Kit watch. The hosts will be wearing their traditional mattress-inspired red and white stripes, which aren\u2019t a feature on the back of the shirt and therefore aren\u2019t pictured below. No need to thank us. Juve meanwhile will sport their third-choice all-black shirts. Cristiano Ronaldo (#7) is understandably of more interest than Wojciech Szczesny (#1) but this makes for a very unsatisfactory countdown. Apologies to fans of space-rocket launches, Manfred Mann and retro confectionery. Atl\u00e9tico make four changes to the side named for the 1-0 win at Rayo Vallecano on Saturday. Thomas, Koke, Juanfran and Diego Costa are in. Santiago Arias, \u00c1ngel Correa and Alvaro Morata drop to the bench, while Alejandro Galvez misses out entirely. Juve make three changes to the team selected for the 3-0 home victory over Frosinone last Friday. Miralem Pjani\u0107, Alex Sandro and Blaise Matuidi return, taking the places of the benched Jo\u00e3o Cancelo and Emre Can, and the injured Sami Khedira. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid: Oblak, Juanfran, Gimenez, Godin, Filipe Luis, Koke, Thomas, Rodri, Saul, Griezmann, Costa. Subs: Adan, Arias, Kalinic, Correa, Lemar, Savic, Morata. Juventus: Szczesny, De Sciglio, Bonucci, Chiellini, Alex Sandro, Bentancur, Pjanic, Matuidi, Dybala, Mandzukic, Ronaldo. Subs: Perin, Caceres, Joao Cancelo, Can, Rugani, Bernardeschi, Spinazzola. Referee: Felix Zwayer (Germany). It\u2019s guaranteed to be another Nearly Year for at least one of the Nearly Teams of recent seasons. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Juventus have both reached the final twice in the past five years, but neither have lifted the trophy during that time. Atl\u00e9tico were denied by their city rivals Real in 2014 and 2016; Juve were downed by Barcelona in 2015 and Real in 2017. Only one of them will still have the chance to right those wrongs after this tie is over. Atl\u00e9tico will be especially desperate to reach the final again, because this season it\u2019s going to be played at their very own Estadio Metropolitano. Diego Simeone\u2019s team aren\u2019t going into this tie in the best form, having won just four of their last nine matches in all competitions. But it\u2019s not all bad news. Antoine Griezmann has smoking-hot boots right now, with ten goals in his last 11 appearances. Los Colchoneros - the reigning Europa League champs - have won their last eight European matches at home. They\u2019re unbeaten in 12 home Champions League matches. And they\u2019ve won their last five home games against Italian teams. Plenty to go on there. Juve\u2019s patchy record against Spanish teams will also give Atl\u00e9tico heart. The Bianconeri have won only three of their last nine matches in Spain (albeit both of the last two, against Real Madrid and Valencia). In total, they\u2019ve lost 16 of 28 away games against teams from La Liga. But then their current form is where they\u2019ll draw inspiration. Massimiliano Allegri\u2019s men are still unbeaten in Serie A, while Cristiano Ronaldo has already celebrated 21 goals in Juve\u2019s zebra stripes, some return for the 34-year-old seeing he\u2019s only played 32 matches. It really depends how you look at it. Both defences are mean as hell, so this may be tense rather than thrilling. Then again, everyone expected a goalfest at Anfield last night, and look what happened there. So here\u2019s hoping we witness a few flying in, as two European giants go toe to toe for a place in the quarter-finals of the 2018-19 Champions League. It\u2019s the 1974, 2014 and 2016 runners-up versus the 1985 and 1996 winners! It\u2019s on! Kick off: 8pm GMT, 9pm local.",

Two late goals from their two Uruguayan centre-backs, first Jos\u00e9 Maria Gim\u00e9nez and then Diego God\u00edn, sent a gigantic roar round this stadium, the kind of noise this place has never heard before. The Wanda Metropolitano, Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s home for just over a year, will host the 2019 Champions League final and, as they sang long and loud, they did so in the hope that their team will be there too, invited to the party they host.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/20/schalke-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report\">Raheem Sterling gives Manchester City crucial advantage over Schalke</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It may be only the first leg, it may be only the last 16, but the manner of Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s victory convinced them that maybe it is possible after all, at a time when some needed convincing.</p> \n<p>Atl\u00e9tico had looked a little lost of late and Juventus had been considered the worst possible opponents, twice finalists in the last four years, the team whose own pursuit of this trophy had led them to sign Cristiano Ronaldo \u2013 the leader of Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s rivals who had twice scored penalties against them in fatalistic finals of their own. He stung Jan Oblak\u2019s hands with a free-kick six minutes into this match and leapt to head goalwards in the very last minute here.</p> \n<p>But Ronaldo could not find the finish and Atl\u00e9tico were not to be denied, not even after they twice thought they had the breakthrough only twice to have it taken away from them by VAR: a first-half penalty that was turned into a free-kick and a second-half goal, headed in by \u00c1lvaro Morata, that was ruled out for a foul.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That might have brought the fatalism flooding back; instead it brought Atl\u00e9tico flooding forward even more. And by the end of a tough, intense and sometimes exhilarating night, they had secured a deserved lead to take to Turin, and this place was going wild. They had just been denied the opening goal when Gim\u00e9nez struck from close range, reaching Morata\u2019s knockdown.

      "bodyText": "For Atl\u00e9tico Madrid it was the perfect finale and it left them dreaming of the perfect final. Two late goals from their two Uruguayan centre-backs, first Jos\u00e9 Maria Gim\u00e9nez and then Diego God\u00edn, sent a gigantic roar round this stadium, the kind of noise this place has never heard before. The Wanda Metropolitano, Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s home for just over a year, will host the 2019 Champions League final and, as they sang long and loud, they did so in the hope that their team will be there too, invited to the party they host. It may be only the first leg, it may be only the last 16, but the manner of Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s victory convinced them that maybe it is possible after all, at a time when some needed convincing. Atl\u00e9tico had looked a little lost of late and Juventus had been considered the worst possible opponents, twice finalists in the last four years, the team whose own pursuit of this trophy had led them to sign Cristiano Ronaldo \u2013 the leader of Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s rivals who had twice scored penalties against them in fatalistic finals of their own. He stung Jan Oblak\u2019s hands with a free-kick six minutes into this match and leapt to head goalwards in the very last minute here. But Ronaldo could not find the finish and Atl\u00e9tico were not to be denied, not even after they twice thought they had the breakthrough only twice to have it taken away from them by VAR: a first-half penalty that was turned into a free-kick and a second-half goal, headed in by \u00c1lvaro Morata, that was ruled out for a foul. That might have brought the fatalism flooding back; instead it brought Atl\u00e9tico flooding forward even more. And by the end of a tough, intense and sometimes exhilarating night, they had secured a deserved lead to take to Turin, and this place was going wild. They had just been denied the opening goal when Gim\u00e9nez struck from close range, reaching Morata\u2019s knockdown. And four minutes later God\u00edn got the second. That this was not going to be the expected tight, defensive game was announced early. After only 48 seconds Antoine Griezmann hooked a shot wide and within a minute Diego Costa was running at Juve. Although his pass was overhit, the start was striking, the game shaping to be direct and open, although there was one Atl\u00e9tico move made up of four consecutive backheels.

Another run brought another chance early in the second half, Griezmann sending Costa dashing clean through, only for him to scuff a dreadful shot wide, his foot taking some of the turf with it.

      "bodyText": "People say love comes in different shapes and sizes, and in Wales on Saturday it will be 6ft 3in and 20st 7lb. Billy Vunipola says he wants to show the Welsh just how much he cares by helping England win at the Principality Stadium. No joke. Vunipola moved to Wales when he was six years old, and he has so much affection and respect for the people he knows there that he will be using those feelings as fuel for the \u201cemotional battle\u201d. After all, Vunipola says, when you are looking for motivation \u201clove works better than hate because you have a clear mind. With hate you think everything\u2019s wrong and it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Vunipola is hard enough to be comfortable showing his soft side. He is happy to talk about how much love he feels for the Welsh, even though he knows full well that the feeling is not always mutual. \u201cThis game runs a little bit deeper, and everyone knows that, and we have to be prepared to fight that,\u201d he says. For his part \u201cthere\u2019s no hate there\u201d. He still has family and friends in Wales, from the five years he spent there while his dad, Fe\u2019ao, was playing for Pontypool, it\u2019s just that \u201conce or twice a year, we kind of divide\u201d. When he was a child, Vunipola never really understood why all his Welsh friends felt the way they did about the English. \u201cI just followed what everyone else was doing.\u201d But \u201cobviously now I\u2019m on the other side of the fence, I can understand them supporting their own. They are a very tight-knit community.\u201d It is up to England, he says, to match that intensity, \u201cbecause we know it\u2019s coming. They have said it themselves, and it\u2019s no joke. We would be kidding ourselves if we went there and said we can just do our job and everything would fall into place.\u201d He adds: \u201cWhen you play the Welsh it\u2019s always a very emotional game.\u201d It\u2019s just that his emotions are a little different to everyone else\u2019s. He will be thinking in particular about Terry Gordon, the old kit man at Pontypool \u201cwho took pity on my dad and took us all under his wing\u201d. Gordon died recently. \u201cWe were at his funeral in Wales a few months ago.\u201d When the family arrived in Wales they had never really been outside Oceania before, and had no idea what to expect. \u201cWe came in the winter in shorts and a T-shirt,\u201d he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what to bring. \u201cWe were very naive when we first came over and didn\u2019t think it would be that cold.\u201d He remembers that he and his brother Mako were amazed that they could see themselves breathing. \u201cWe thought that was the coolest thing ever. We pretended we were like the old guys smoking. But it wasn\u2019t cool when we were trying to go to sleep and it was still happening.\u201d Gordon gave them \u201cextra duvets, extra pillows, jumpers \u2013 all those little things, those little gestures, and big things too: like helping with visas, and my dad\u2019s work permit and things like that\u201d. Mako has still got a hint of the old Welsh accent. Billy says he used to have one too but lost it when he won his scholarship to Harrow, because \u201cthey didn\u2019t understand me, so I tried to be very clear with my words\u201d. Despite all that, he says he has always felt loyal to England because the people there were so good to him. \u201cJust like in Wales, I had great people who brought me through the system,\u201d he says. \u201cI was only 15 at the time and I got called up to the under-18 set-up with John Fletcher and Peter Walton, and for three years those guys nurtured me, turned me into the player that I am today.\u201d That player, of course, is one of the best in the world, although he says he is still looking for his best form after all the injuries he had last year. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m there yet,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to build up to it.\u201d This weekend would be a good time to find it. \u201cThere\u2019s more urgency this week,\u201d he says, because two of England\u2019s best players, Mako and Maro Itoje, are injured.

Of those, almost one in 10 said they had been \u201cgiven no choice\u201d in the matter and 22 people said they had undergone forced sexual activity with or involving someone of the opposite gender.</p> <p>The most common reason given was a belief that their desires were \u201csinful\u201d. About half were teenagers at the time; a few said they had been under the age of 12. More than three-quarters said the attempt to change their sexual orientation had not worked. Thirteen people said it had \u201cworked completely\u201d.</p> <p>Over half reported mental health problems, most commonly anxiety and depression. Almost 300 people said they had attempted suicide or had suicidal thoughts. More than 100 said they had self-harmed and 70 reported suffering from eating disorders.</p> <p>Bayes said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear there is a whole lot of hurt that the churches and the other faiths have administered to people. The C of E was right to say 18 months ago that this practice should come to an end, and we need to carry that through on the ground.\u201d</p> <p>Although he had received no complaints about the issue in Liverpool, he said: \u201cI think there is still a work of education to be done in the different dioceses. Bishops need to make sure that local churches understand that LGBTI orientation and identity is not a crime, not a sin and that conversion therapy should be brought to an end.</p> <p>\u201cIf people are made to feel second rate on account of their sexuality or their gender identity, that is wrong. And wherever it happens it needs to be repented of, and I and others need to apologise to anyone who\u2019s been hurt by that. It\u2019s hurtful to be told that the way God made you is wrong and you need prayers to change it. There is a culture change in certain parts of the church which is ongoing, and the only way to fix that is through constant education.\u201d</p> <p>Jayne Ozanne, who set up the foundation and who underwent conversion therapy resulting in two nervous breakdowns, said: \u201cThe scale and severity of the problems reported and the age at which children are said to be exposed to these practices are of the gravest concern. These are serious safeguarding issues which require urgent action.\u201d</p> <p>Conversion therapy was discredited and caused significant harm, said Martin Pollecoff of the UK Council for Psychotherapists and a member of the foundation\u2019s advisory board. \u201cOur aim is to help people come to terms with their sexuality so that they can embrace and celebrate who they are, rather than living in shame and fear.\u201d</p>",

The results were \u201cshocking and sobering\u201d, said Paul Bayes, the bishop of Liverpool and the foundation\u2019s chair. \u201cThe statistics reflect lives which have been scarred and strained by mixed messaging of love, acceptance, condemnation and fear.\u201d In July 2017, the C of E condemned the practice of conversion therapy, which aims to change sexual orientation, as unethical and potentially harmful, and called on the government to ban it. It had \u201cno place in the modern world\u201d, said a motion passed overwhelmingly by synod members. However, a few Anglican churches and others in the Pentecostal tradition still encourage people to take part in prayer sessions or \u201cdeliverance ministry\u201d to change their sexual orientation. Out of more than 4,600 people who took part in the online faith and sexuality survey, about 10% \u2013 458 \u2013 said they had undergone efforts to change their sexuality. Of those, almost one in 10 said they had been \u201cgiven no choice\u201d in the matter and 22 people said they had undergone forced sexual activity with or involving someone of the opposite gender. The most common reason given was a belief that their desires were \u201csinful\u201d. About half were teenagers at the time; a few said they had been under the age of 12. More than three-quarters said the attempt to change their sexual orientation had not worked. Thirteen people said it had \u201cworked completely\u201d. Over half reported mental health problems, most commonly anxiety and depression. Almost 300 people said they had attempted suicide or had suicidal thoughts. More than 100 said they had self-harmed and 70 reported suffering from eating disorders. Bayes said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear there is a whole lot of hurt that the churches and the other faiths have administered to people. The C of E was right to say 18 months ago that this practice should come to an end, and we need to carry that through on the ground.\u201d Although he had received no complaints about the issue in Liverpool, he said: \u201cI think there is still a work of education to be done in the different dioceses. Bishops need to make sure that local churches understand that LGBTI orientation and identity is not a crime, not a sin and that conversion therapy should be brought to an end. \u201cIf people are made to feel second rate on account of their sexuality or their gender identity, that is wrong. And wherever it happens it needs to be repented of, and I and others need to apologise to anyone who\u2019s been hurt by that. It\u2019s hurtful to be told that the way God made you is wrong and you need prayers to change it. There is a culture change in certain parts of the church which is ongoing, and the only way to fix that is through constant education.\u201d Jayne Ozanne, who set up the foundation and who underwent conversion therapy resulting in two nervous breakdowns, said: \u201cThe scale and severity of the problems reported and the age at which children are said to be exposed to these practices are of the gravest concern. These are serious safeguarding issues which require urgent action.\u201d Conversion therapy was discredited and caused significant harm, said Martin Pollecoff of the UK Council for Psychotherapists and a member of the foundation\u2019s advisory board. \u201cOur aim is to help people come to terms with their sexuality so that they can embrace and celebrate who they are, rather than living in shame and fear.\u201d",

Shortly before meeting the prime minister, Juncker predicted there would be no breakthrough.</p> <p>A joint statement on Wednesday appeared to live up to that promise, but the two leaders promised to talk again before the end of the month and described talks as \u201cconstructive\u201d. The two sides said they were \u201cseized of the tight timescale and the historic significance of setting the EU and the UK on a path to a deep and unique future partnership\u201d.</p> <p>In an olive branch to May, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, were tasked with looking at the role \u201calternative arrangements\u201d could play in replacing the contested Irish backstop in future.</p> <p>But the EU continues to rule out changes to the backstop, which is intended to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland.</p> <p>Speaking after the meeting, May said she had \u201cunderlined the need for us to see legally binding changes to the backstop which ensure it cannot be indefinite. That\u2019s what is required if a deal is going to pass the House of Commons.</p> <p>\u201cTime is of the essence and it\u2019s in both our interests that when the UK leaves the EU it does so in an orderly way,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Before the encounter, Juncker met Slovenia\u2019s president, Borut Pahor, who voiced hope a deal could be reached while stressing he backed Ireland over the backstop: \u201cSomething not acceptable to Dublin would not be acceptable to Slovenia either.\u201d</p> <p>At the same press conference Juncker joked that May was not to blame for a shaving injury to his cheek. \u201cYou will have noted that I have the outcome of an unfortunate gesture this morning,\u201d he said referring to a plaster on his face. \u201cI am just telling you this because I don\u2019t want you to think that Mrs May is responsible for this injury.\u201d</p> <p>Privately, officials are in no joking mood, with frustration over Brexit \u201cgroundhog day\u201d running high. One senior EU diplomat said May was to blame for failing to confront hardline Eurosceptic Tories. \u201cShe gave the impression that you can stay in your delusional comfort zone, but you can\u2019t,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cUnless she is ready to choose there is nothing we can do.\u201d</p> <p>The government has backed away from hopes of rewriting the Brexit withdrawal treaty. May hopes for stronger guarantees that the backstop would never come into force. Barclay and the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, are due in Brussels on Thursday for further talks. Cox is seen as a pivotal figure in Brussels, as officials think any change in his legal advice could persuade Tory MPs to back the deal.</p> <p>According to senior figures in the UK government, Cox\u2019s plan A is a \u201ccodicil\u201d that would allow the UK to quit the backstop unilaterally with one year\u2019s notice. While some cabinet ministers think it is promising, it is likely to get short shrift in Brussels. The EU has long ruled out any unilateral exit mechanism, insisting that any additional legal text cannot contradict the existing Brexit deal.</p> <p>The two sides are working on a legal document that would firm up existing guarantees that the backstop would never be used. Sterling rose after Spain\u2019s foreign minister, Josep Borrell, said progress was being made on a text. \u201cThe EU\u2019s position is that the treaty won\u2019t be reopened, but can be interpreted, or complemented with explanations that may be satisfactory,\u201d he told Bloomberg.</p> <p>EU diplomats in Brussels sounded a more sceptical note. Many doubt that that a legal text that does not alter the backstop could win over Tory Eurosceptics. One said it \u201cdidn\u2019t seem realistic\u201d such a text would change anything in the UK parliament. \u201cThis fudge language, which is part of the British political tradition, doesn\u2019t really work with EU law,\u201d the diplomat said.</p> <p>The recent spate of defections from Labour and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/20/tory-mps-defect-independent-group-soubry-allen-wollaston\">the Conservatives</a> is seen as complicating the prime minister\u2019s quest for a majority. \u201cIt makes it difficult for any British government to negotiate,\u201d the diplomat said.</p> <p><br></p>",

That\u2019s what is required if a deal is going to pass the House of Commons. \u201cTime is of the essence and it\u2019s in both our interests that when the UK leaves the EU it does so in an orderly way,\u201d she said. Before the encounter, Juncker met Slovenia\u2019s president, Borut Pahor, who voiced hope a deal could be reached while stressing he backed Ireland over the backstop: \u201cSomething not acceptable to Dublin would not be acceptable to Slovenia either.\u201d At the same press conference Juncker joked that May was not to blame for a shaving injury to his cheek. \u201cYou will have noted that I have the outcome of an unfortunate gesture this morning,\u201d he said referring to a plaster on his face. \u201cI am just telling you this because I don\u2019t want you to think that Mrs May is responsible for this injury.\u201d Privately, officials are in no joking mood, with frustration over Brexit \u201cgroundhog day\u201d running high. One senior EU diplomat said May was to blame for failing to confront hardline Eurosceptic Tories. \u201cShe gave the impression that you can stay in your delusional comfort zone, but you can\u2019t,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cUnless she is ready to choose there is nothing we can do.\u201d The government has backed away from hopes of rewriting the Brexit withdrawal treaty. May hopes for stronger guarantees that the backstop would never come into force. Barclay and the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, are due in Brussels on Thursday for further talks. Cox is seen as a pivotal figure in Brussels, as officials think any change in his legal advice could persuade Tory MPs to back the deal. According to senior figures in the UK government, Cox\u2019s plan A is a \u201ccodicil\u201d that would allow the UK to quit the backstop unilaterally with one year\u2019s notice. While some cabinet ministers think it is promising, it is likely to get short shrift in Brussels. The EU has long ruled out any unilateral exit mechanism, insisting that any additional legal text cannot contradict the existing Brexit deal. The two sides are working on a legal document that would firm up existing guarantees that the backstop would never be used. Sterling rose after Spain\u2019s foreign minister, Josep Borrell, said progress was being made on a text. \u201cThe EU\u2019s position is that the treaty won\u2019t be reopened, but can be interpreted, or complemented with explanations that may be satisfactory,\u201d he told Bloomberg. EU diplomats in Brussels sounded a more sceptical note. Many doubt that that a legal text that does not alter the backstop could win over Tory Eurosceptics. One said it \u201cdidn\u2019t seem realistic\u201d such a text would change anything in the UK parliament. \u201cThis fudge language, which is part of the British political tradition, doesn\u2019t really work with EU law,\u201d the diplomat said. The recent spate of defections from Labour and the Conservatives is seen as complicating the prime minister\u2019s quest for a majority. \u201cIt makes it difficult for any British government to negotiate,\u201d the diplomat said.",

Hence, many opt for the shortcut: pulling them right out of the ground.</p> \n<p>For land managers and scientists who work with cacti, the problem appears to be on the rise. While the precise scale is difficult to measure, and catching thieves red-handed in remote deserts is nearly impossible, major busts offer clues. In 2014, more than 2,600 stolen cacti were seized at US borders \u2013 up from 411 just a year before.

The demand is so high that I fear we can\u2019t stop the illegal trade going on.\u201d</p> \n<p>While many plants fall victim to underground cactus cartels, a seemingly more benign form of theft has become part of the problem, too.

They hide the plants in their suitcase and take them back to their greenhouse in Europe.\u201d</p> \n<p>Minnich, 71, has been a cactus grower and nursery operator in New Mexico for 50 years. He said the internet had significantly accelerated theft of rare, slow-growing cactus species over the last decade. A case in point: <em>Sclerocactus havasupaiensis</em>, which is native to one drainage at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, was being auctioned on eBay in early January by a seller in Ukraine. It was just one of more than 365 internationally protected plant species that are openly traded on Amazon and eBay.</p> \n<p>\u201cDo a Google search on Sclerocactus and you can find people in Russia selling them,\u201d said Minnich. \u201cI have been on public lands in Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado where years ago Sclerocactus were everywhere, and recently I found just a bunch of little holes in the ground.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12117305003af2142ecf1b6229cf0b161a538385\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12117305003af2142ecf1b6229cf0b161a538385/0_0_2200_1467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samuel Arnberger was among the first rangers to insert the RFID chips into the saguaros when the program started.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samuel Arnberger was among the first rangers to insert the RFID chips into the saguaros.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eirini Pajak/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>\u2018If you steal a cactus, we will find you\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>Back at Saguaro national park, the Guardian joined park staff to see the chipping scheme in action.

Meanwhile an electric reader, waved over the plant, allowed previous chips to be checked.</p> \n<p>Cactus thieves have long targeted the park: one of the most notorious incidents happened in 2007, when a landscaper named Joseph Tillman dug up 17 saguaros with a friend. The pair were apprehended by a ranger while trying to load the stash into a pickup truck, and Tillman was given eight months in prison, one of the harshest sentences ever for a cactus rustler.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0c042fcd-e351-4efb-b652-16fc6a90912c\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Experts offer advice for ethical cactus shopping</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Avoid buying cactus from international sellers without a permit from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites), especially from countries where the plant is not native.</li>\n     <li>If buying online, seek out domestic sellers that advertise their cacti as being grown from seed.</li>\n     <li>When you are in a nursery and there is no source information for a cactus, ask where it came from.</li>\n     <li>Is the cactus scrappy looking?

One of the hottest commodities at the moment is <em>Ariocarpus fissuratus</em>, commonly called the living rock cactus. To the untrained observer this little lump of a plant looks completely unremarkable, like a dark green sea sponge. But in the fall, when conditions are right, the cactus is topped with bright pink flowers.</p> \n<p>Not-for-profit nurseries across the south-west often serve as rescue facilities for confiscated wild plants. One of those is the Pima County Native Plant Nursery in Tucson, Arizona. In December last year, the nursery received 200 <em>Ariocarpus fissuratus</em> from a seizure by US Customs and Border Protection. According to Jessie Byrd, the nursery manager, a man was caught with some 2,000 plants, stolen in west Texas, that he was attempting to get across the border into Mexico.</p> \n<p>Her greenhouse was filled with living rocks being rehabilitated after their stressful journey. \u201cThis was stolen because it is coveted by collectors,\u201d said Byrd, holding one of the cacti in her hand. The living rock is extremely slow-growing even by cactus standards: the shriveled, black specimen she held was about the size of a tennis ball. She said it was 30 to 40 years old.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/27/stolen-succulents-california-hipster-plants-at-center-of-smuggling-crisis\">Stolen succulents: California hipster plants at center of smuggling crisis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In 2015, US officials made another large seizure of <em>Ariocarpus fissuratus</em> and those plants \u2013 all 3,500 of them \u2013 ended up at a greenhouse in Alpine, Texas, belonging to Sul Ross State University. \u201cYou could tell the people who stole the plants were money lovers, not cactus lovers,\u201d said Karen Little, Sul Ross\u2019s greenhouse manager. \u201cThe plants were just yanked out of the ground and stuffed into garbage bags.\u201d</p> \n<p>Authorities suspect the plants were stolen from nearby public lands, including Big Bend national park and Big Bend Ranch state park. \u201cCactus theft is a huge issue in the Trans Pecos,\u201d said Little, referring to the sprawling desert in west Texas where Sul Ross is located. \u201cWe have whole genetic lines of cacti that have been wiped out by poachers.\u201d</p> \n<p>One of the major challenges for conservationists is that the most endangered cacti are the most vulnerable to theft. \u201cThe more rare or harder it is to get, the more valuable the cactus is to collectors,\u201d said Steven Blackwell, a biologist for the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a reality Blackwell and his colleagues have experienced with frustrating frequency. In the summer of 2018, while studying endangered acuna cacti at an air force training area in south-western Arizona, he arrived one day to discover his remote research plot had been entirely obliterated. \u201cAll the cacti were gone and the ground was full of divots where the plants had been obviously dug up,\u201d Blackwell recalled. He never even reported the acuna theft to land managers, because he figured nothing could be done.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fbd8450e901412fb1782308a690261528d0e193a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbd8450e901412fb1782308a690261528d0e193a/0_0_2200_1467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gene Joseph, owner of the nursery \u2018Plants for the Southwest\u2019 in Tucson turns on his hose to water his Ariocarpus plants among other succulents in one of his greenhouses.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gene Joseph, owner of the nursery Plants for the Southwest in Tucson, waters his succulents.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eirini Pajak/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Taking the slow road</strong></h2> \n<p>Not everyone has given up hope. Gene Joseph, a longtime Tucson nursery owner, believes the best way to thwart illegal trade is simply doing the slow, steady work of raising new cacti from scratch. Joseph\u2019s greenhouse is home to some of the rarest, smallest and slowest-growing species. \u201cWhen nurseries are producing rare plants from seed, the pressure to steal from the wild goes down,\u201d he explained.</p> \n<p>Joseph said it often takes up to two decades for a cactus to reach the commercially viable \u201cspecimen\u201d size \u2013 he currently sells living rock cactus grown in his nursery for 15 years. That\u2019s about as long as it takes to raise a child, so understandably, he gets attached. \u201cSometimes it is hard to let go, but I can\u2019t keep them forever,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Joseph\u2019s facility is comprised of acres of shade houses and greenhouses. With two golden retrievers at his heels, he methodically tends to thousands of plants each day. After his watering rounds are done, he puts on his reading glasses to pinch off tiny seeds from cactus fruit so he can grow more plants, carefully pollinating the flowers by hand.</p> \n<p>At the beginning of the new year, the Sul Ross greenhouse manager, Karen Little, was still working on finding permanent places for 1,500 of the 3,500 stolen <em>Ariocarpus fissuratus</em> she inherited in 2015. Due to international trade protections, the endangered cacti cannot be sold and must rather be given away for safekeeping to responsible stewards or other not-for-profit greenhouses. It has been like trying to adopt out a very large litter of stray puppies. Some have gone to trusted collectors, others to nurseries. \u201cIt\u2019s been my honor to find good homes for them,\u201d she says.</p>",

Meanwhile an electric reader, waved over the plant, allowed previous chips to be checked. Cactus thieves have long targeted the park: one of the most notorious incidents happened in 2007, when a landscaper named Joseph Tillman dug up 17 saguaros with a friend. The pair were apprehended by a ranger while trying to load the stash into a pickup truck, and Tillman was given eight months in prison, one of the harshest sentences ever for a cactus rustler. Approximately 700 saguaros have been microchipped since the program began, meaning law enforcement can scan cacti at commercial nurseries in search of missing plants. \u201cWe are now able to tie a stolen plant directly back to a hole,\u201d said O\u2019Neil. Since the chips have been installed and the program widely publicized, there have been no known cases of saguaro theft in the park. \u201cIt is a very effective deterrent,\u201d said O\u2019Neil. \u201cWe want people to be aware that if you steal a cactus from us, we will find you.\u201d New species at risk Those who study cactus theft say that changing consumer trends are putting new species at risk. One of the hottest commodities at the moment is Ariocarpus fissuratus, commonly called the living rock cactus. To the untrained observer this little lump of a plant looks completely unremarkable, like a dark green sea sponge. But in the fall, when conditions are right, the cactus is topped with bright pink flowers. Not-for-profit nurseries across the south-west often serve as rescue facilities for confiscated wild plants. One of those is the Pima County Native Plant Nursery in Tucson, Arizona. In December last year, the nursery received 200 Ariocarpus fissuratus from a seizure by US Customs and Border Protection. According to Jessie Byrd, the nursery manager, a man was caught with some 2,000 plants, stolen in west Texas, that he was attempting to get across the border into Mexico. Her greenhouse was filled with living rocks being rehabilitated after their stressful journey. \u201cThis was stolen because it is coveted by collectors,\u201d said Byrd, holding one of the cacti in her hand. The living rock is extremely slow-growing even by cactus standards: the shriveled, black specimen she held was about the size of a tennis ball. She said it was 30 to 40 years old. In 2015, US officials made another large seizure of Ariocarpus fissuratus and those plants \u2013 all 3,500 of them \u2013 ended up at a greenhouse in Alpine, Texas, belonging to Sul Ross State University. \u201cYou could tell the people who stole the plants were money lovers, not cactus lovers,\u201d said Karen Little, Sul Ross\u2019s greenhouse manager. \u201cThe plants were just yanked out of the ground and stuffed into garbage bags.\u201d Authorities suspect the plants were stolen from nearby public lands, including Big Bend national park and Big Bend Ranch state park. \u201cCactus theft is a huge issue in the Trans Pecos,\u201d said Little, referring to the sprawling desert in west Texas where Sul Ross is located. \u201cWe have whole genetic lines of cacti that have been wiped out by poachers.\u201d One of the major challenges for conservationists is that the most endangered cacti are the most vulnerable to theft. \u201cThe more rare or harder it is to get, the more valuable the cactus is to collectors,\u201d said Steven Blackwell, a biologist for the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix. It\u2019s a reality Blackwell and his colleagues have experienced with frustrating frequency. In the summer of 2018, while studying endangered acuna cacti at an air force training area in south-western Arizona, he arrived one day to discover his remote research plot had been entirely obliterated. \u201cAll the cacti were gone and the ground was full of divots where the plants had been obviously dug up,\u201d Blackwell recalled. He never even reported the acuna theft to land managers, because he figured nothing could be done. Taking the slow road Not everyone has given up hope. Gene Joseph, a longtime Tucson nursery owner, believes the best way to thwart illegal trade is simply doing the slow, steady work of raising new cacti from scratch. Joseph\u2019s greenhouse is home to some of the rarest, smallest and slowest-growing species. \u201cWhen nurseries are producing rare plants from seed, the pressure to steal from the wild goes down,\u201d he explained. Joseph said it often takes up to two decades for a cactus to reach the commercially viable \u201cspecimen\u201d size \u2013 he currently sells living rock cactus grown in his nursery for 15 years. That\u2019s about as long as it takes to raise a child, so understandably, he gets attached. \u201cSometimes it is hard to let go, but I can\u2019t keep them forever,\u201d he said. Joseph\u2019s facility is comprised of acres of shade houses and greenhouses. With two golden retrievers at his heels, he methodically tends to thousands of plants each day. After his watering rounds are done, he puts on his reading glasses to pinch off tiny seeds from cactus fruit so he can grow more plants, carefully pollinating the flowers by hand. At the beginning of the new year, the Sul Ross greenhouse manager, Karen Little, was still working on finding permanent places for 1,500 of the 3,500 stolen Ariocarpus fissuratus she inherited in 2015. Due to international trade protections, the endangered cacti cannot be sold and must rather be given away for safekeeping to responsible stewards or other not-for-profit greenhouses. It has been like trying to adopt out a very large litter of stray puppies. Some have gone to trusted collectors, others to nurseries. \u201cIt\u2019s been my honor to find good homes for them,\u201d she says.",

Commanders fear the tiny area still under Isis control is riddled with tunnels and laced with the IEDs and suicide vehicles that have turned the battles to reclaim cities under their control in the last few years, such as Mosul, into bloody street-by-street fighting. Since the operation began, an estimated 20,000 civilians and families of fighters have left Baghuz, many walking for three or four hours to reach the Western-backed SDF, a mostly Kurdish fighting force. Many reported that Isis had shot those attempting desertion as they fled the airstrikes and shelling. The evacuation convoy on Wednesday, however, as well as the presence of Isis fighters among the women and children, suggested the battle was finally moving into its endgame. SDF fighters held prisoner in the town were exchanged in return for food this week, another sign that Isis, low on supplies and ammunition, is at last weakening. On Tuesday, the SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said a military operation to oust the extremists from Baghuz would be launched if those still in the town refused to surrender. The fleeing Isis men, believed to be mostly Iraqi and Syrian, hoped to blend in with the civilians, and eventually leave Kurdish displacement camps for Syria\u2019s Idlib province, still in rebel hands, or to Anbar over the Iraqi border. The men who remain appear willing to fight to the death, and it is unclear how many women and children are with them, and whether they are there willingly or being held as human shields. The fate of Yusuf and Zahra Shikder, American children abducted by their mother and taken to Syria four years ago, is still unknown. They are believed to be with the few hundred fighters and diehard ideologues left. Most of the children lucky enough to escape smiled at the passing SDF convoys as they left the town on Wednesday; one small boy flashed a victory sign. They will be taken to an internment camp 200 miles away, where their fate is still far from certain. Several western governments have said their citizens fleeing the caliphate\u2019s fall were not welcome at home; Isis families who fled other battles have been living in camps across Kurdish-held Syria for the last two years. The SDF insists it cannot house Isis fighters and their families long-term, and the timeframe for action is likely to be complicated when Donald Trump fulfils his pledge to pull US troops out of the area, a decision which will open a new chapter in Syria\u2019s eight-year-old war. The Guardian saw a convoy of at least 60 empty trucks streaming past the Kurdish town of Hasekeh, which locals say come from Iraq with increasing frequency, and leave filled with US equipment to drive back over the border before the supposed April deadline for the drawdown.",

St-Pierre, 37, was already a three-time UFC welterweight champion when he first retired on top following his ninth consecutive title defense in 2013.

      "body": "<p>The lethal crush in the central \u201cpens\u201d of the Leppings Lane terrace at Hillsborough in 1989, in which 96 people were killed, was like a \u201cwaterfall\u201d, a \u201chuman cascade\u201d, a Liverpool supporter who helped injured and dying people has recalled.</p> <p>Frederick Eccleston, who was 55 when he went to support Liverpool against Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup semi-final at Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s stadium, said he was a nurse manager with Wirral Health Authority who gave first aid and tried to resuscitate people pulled out of the crush.</p> <p>Giving evidence at the trial for manslaughter of David Duckenfield, the former chief superintendent with South Yorkshire police who was in command at the match, Eccleston said that from his position on the north-west terrace, he could see that people were \u201cin trouble\u201d in the central pens, shortly after the match kicked off at 3pm.</p> <p>As he had some medical training, Eccleston said he asked a steward and police officer\u2019s permission to go on to the pitch, then ran to an open gate in front of the pens and began helping a police officer pull people out.</p> <p>\u201cI stood alongside him and I\u2019ve never seen his face. To me he is my hero,\u201d Eccleston told the court. \u201cWe both were pulling people out of that human cascade. It was like a waterfall, with people tumbling down on each other.\u201d</p> <p>They pulled people out by their arms, legs, hair and cheeks, Eccleston said, and he recalled \u201ca memory I will die with\u201d of people trapped in the crush.</p> <p>\u201cThere were two young ladies, whispering \u2018help us\u2019, as their complexion was turning blue,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Eccleston tried to resuscitate people and helped take some of those injured to the Hillsborough gymnasium, where he later saw \u201c40 or 50 body bags, filling up with people\u201d.</p> <p>Questioned by Christine Agnew QC, for the prosecution, Eccleston said he had been to the semi-final at Hillsborough the previous year, also between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, with his daughter, Jo. In 1988, he said, police were checking that people had tickets at the approach to the Leppings Lane end, which was allocated to Liverpool supporters, before allowing them to proceed to the turnstiles. Once inside, he said, he and his daughter headed towards a tunnel facing them, but they were turned away by police officers and stewards stationed in front of it, who told them the pen it led to was full.</p> <p>The jury at Preston crown court has already been told that in 1989, when Duckenfield was in command, police did not check for tickets outside the 23 Leppings Lane turnstiles allocated for all 24,000 people supporting Liverpool. A large crowd built up at the turnstiles, in which Eccleston said he had been lifted off his feet, and \u201ccatapulted\u201d over a turnstile. At 2.52pm, Duckenfield agreed with a third request from a superintendent, Roger Marshall, for large exit gates to be opened to alleviate that crush outside. Inside the ground, the tunnel leading to the central pens was not closed off, and many of the approximately 2,000 people who came in went down the tunnel. The lethal crush took place in the central pens.</p> <p>The judge, Sir Peter Openshaw, thanked Eccleston for coming to court to give evidence.

      "bodyText": "The lethal crush in the central \u201cpens\u201d of the Leppings Lane terrace at Hillsborough in 1989, in which 96 people were killed, was like a \u201cwaterfall\u201d, a \u201chuman cascade\u201d, a Liverpool supporter who helped injured and dying people has recalled. Frederick Eccleston, who was 55 when he went to support Liverpool against Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup semi-final at Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s stadium, said he was a nurse manager with Wirral Health Authority who gave first aid and tried to resuscitate people pulled out of the crush. Giving evidence at the trial for manslaughter of David Duckenfield, the former chief superintendent with South Yorkshire police who was in command at the match, Eccleston said that from his position on the north-west terrace, he could see that people were \u201cin trouble\u201d in the central pens, shortly after the match kicked off at 3pm. As he had some medical training, Eccleston said he asked a steward and police officer\u2019s permission to go on to the pitch, then ran to an open gate in front of the pens and began helping a police officer pull people out. \u201cI stood alongside him and I\u2019ve never seen his face. To me he is my hero,\u201d Eccleston told the court. \u201cWe both were pulling people out of that human cascade. It was like a waterfall, with people tumbling down on each other.\u201d They pulled people out by their arms, legs, hair and cheeks, Eccleston said, and he recalled \u201ca memory I will die with\u201d of people trapped in the crush. \u201cThere were two young ladies, whispering \u2018help us\u2019, as their complexion was turning blue,\u201d he said. Eccleston tried to resuscitate people and helped take some of those injured to the Hillsborough gymnasium, where he later saw \u201c40 or 50 body bags, filling up with people\u201d. Questioned by Christine Agnew QC, for the prosecution, Eccleston said he had been to the semi-final at Hillsborough the previous year, also between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, with his daughter, Jo. In 1988, he said, police were checking that people had tickets at the approach to the Leppings Lane end, which was allocated to Liverpool supporters, before allowing them to proceed to the turnstiles. Once inside, he said, he and his daughter headed towards a tunnel facing them, but they were turned away by police officers and stewards stationed in front of it, who told them the pen it led to was full. The jury at Preston crown court has already been told that in 1989, when Duckenfield was in command, police did not check for tickets outside the 23 Leppings Lane turnstiles allocated for all 24,000 people supporting Liverpool. A large crowd built up at the turnstiles, in which Eccleston said he had been lifted off his feet, and \u201ccatapulted\u201d over a turnstile. At 2.52pm, Duckenfield agreed with a third request from a superintendent, Roger Marshall, for large exit gates to be opened to alleviate that crush outside. Inside the ground, the tunnel leading to the central pens was not closed off, and many of the approximately 2,000 people who came in went down the tunnel. The lethal crush took place in the central pens. The judge, Sir Peter Openshaw, thanked Eccleston for coming to court to give evidence. He replied: \u201cIt\u2019s my privilege and duty to be here today. I witnessed some terrible scenes which will live with me ... And thank you for giving me the opportunity.\u201d Fiona Nicol, a constable in 1989 on duty in front of the Leppings Lane terraces, also recalled the Leppings Lane tunnel being closed previously, saying she had at one match been ordered to stand in front of it with other officers.

It followed an $885m settlement in 2013 with the US federal housing finance agency over <a href=\"http://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/FHFA-Announces-Settlement-with-UBS.aspx\">similar allegations</a>.</p> <p>Commenting on Wednesday\u2019s court ruling, the bank said in a statement: \u201cUBS strongly disagrees with the verdict.

      "bodyText": "UBS has been ordered to pay \u20ac4.5bn (\u00a33.9bn) by a French court for helping wealthy clients dodge tax, adding to a raft of violations that stand to leave the Swiss bank almost \u00a38bn out of pocket. The lender was found guilty on Wednesday of illegal solicitation and laundering proceeds of tax fraud, a ruling which came with a \u20ac3.7bn fine and \u20ac800m in civil damages. The total penalty is said to be a record for France, and outstrips UBS\u2019 full-year net profit of $4.9bn (\u00a33.7bn) for 2018. UBS has denied any wrongdoing and has pledged to appeal the French court\u2019s judgment. The ruling is the latest violation to be laid on UBS\u2019s doorstep, having already accrued $5bn in penalties in the US alone since 2000, according to figures compiled by corporate misconduct search engine Violation Tracker. Adding Wednesday\u2019s ruling to the list, it would mean UBS could be at least \u00a37.7bn out of pocket due to a raft of settlements and fines over past two decades. However, a formal appeal by UBS will pause any immediate payout over the French case. In 2009, UBS shelled out $780m as part of a deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice, having admitted to helping US clients hid their accounts from the taxman. Unsealed court documents claimed that bank employees helped US taxpayers open new UBS accounts in the names of nominees or sham entities, to assist them in tax evasion. In 2012, the bank agreed to pay $1.5bn to US, UK, and Swiss regulators in relation to interest rate manipulation, which at the time was one of the largest fines ever imposed on a bank. Smaller fines have also been levied on the bank over issues including supervision failures and breaching US economic sanctions. UBS is still facing a lawsuit by the US Department of Justice over the sale of residential mortgage-backed securities in 2006 and 2007. The suit, which was announced in November, came after a $230m settlement that UBS reached with the state of New York in March, following a probe into the bank\u2019s packaging and sale of the financial products. It followed an $885m settlement in 2013 with the US federal housing finance agency over similar allegations. Commenting on Wednesday\u2019s court ruling, the bank said in a statement: \u201cUBS strongly disagrees with the verdict. The bank has consistently contested any criminal wrongdoing in this case throughout the investigation and during the trial.\u201d It claimed that the conviction was \u201cnot supported by any concrete evidence, but instead is based on the unfounded allegations of former employees who were not even heard at the trial\u201d. The lender also took issue with the cross-border ruling. \u201cNo evidence was provided that any French client was solicited on French soil by a UBS AG client adviser to open an account in Switzerland. As no offence in France was established, the decision effectively applies French law in Switzerland. \u201cThis undermines the sovereignty of Swiss law and poses significant questions of territoriality.\u201d It added: \u201cUBS will appeal the verdict and evaluate whether the written decision requires any additional steps.\u201d",

The list of Tory resigners goes back to Winston Churchill in 1904 and beyond. And they are unlikely to be the last. Back in October I had a coffee at the Tory conference with a cabinet minister who confessed: \u201cPart of me is longing for Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg to become leader so the rest of us can just leave and join a new party.\u201d</p> <p>Wednesday\u2019s departure of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/20/who-are-the-three-tory-defectors\" title=\"\">\u201cthe three amigos\u201d</a>, as Allen called them at their press conference, does not make that much larger Tory fissure a certainty \u2013 much will depend on the Brexit endgame. But it makes it more likely. It also marks a potential watershed for the 21st-century Conservative party. When the three former Tory female MPs - and their gender is definitely part of the story -crossed the floor of the House of Commons this morning, they threw down the gauntlet to an entire generation of 21st-century Tory modernisers to either stand up or stand down.</p> <p>They did something else too. The sight of a group of MPs abandoning a Tory government to sit with the opposition is unusual enough. What made their move even more unusual was that the three women went straight over to sit with the seven \u2013 now eight \u2013 former Labour MPs who themselves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/19/at-times-like-these-corbyn-is-his-own-worst-enemy\" title=\"\">broke with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party on Monday</a>. By doing this they raised, in the most visible way, the possibility that these 11 independents are the outriders of a new party formed from simultaneous splits of both the two main parties in parliament.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/20/tory-mps-defect-independent-group-soubry-allen-wollaston\">Tory modernising wing has been destroyed, say defecting trio of MPs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Commentators should be wary of claiming that things are without precedent. But it is genuinely hard to think of any previous new political grouping that drew on both the main parties as this one has. That was certainly not the case with the Social Democrats in 1981, who were overwhelmingly a split from Labour. Let\u2019s just agree that British party politics has witnessed something extremely unusual this week, whether it succeeds or it fails.</p> <p>It is tempting to see the independents as the often trailed new centre party that many have expected \u2013 and some have hoped \u2013 would emerge from the simultaneous moves of Labour to the far left under Corbyn and of the Tories to the far right in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Some of the independents see themselves that way. Sarah Wollaston was explicit that her move was \u201cabout more than Brexit\u201d, and that she foresaw a \u201cthird way\u201d grouping. The independents\u2019 website also says they aim to provide a home for refugees from both parties.</p> <p>Much of the commentary on this week\u2019s events will present the independents in that light. There is some truth in it. The independents have a social market ideology that slots between the extremes on the old left-right spectrum which some still use to explain our politics. They think of themselves as centrists of both the left and right. The polls show a section of the electorate \u2013 as much as 10% in the first week of their existence \u2013 has quickly embraced the new grouping.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4292da8ec0f3b7740cdd70cd4fd92fce59ba8074\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4292da8ec0f3b7740cdd70cd4fd92fce59ba8074/0_0_5065_3376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Independent Group in the House of Commons on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Independent Group in the House of Commons on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The independents would not exist except for the politics of Brexit. Frustration with Corbyn\u2019s equivocations on Brexit helped to drive the former Labour MPs into the group. Despair with the Tory right\u2019s grip on May\u2019s Brexit strategy did the equivalent for the former Conservatives. Yet on Europe, as the political scientist guru <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jun/20/john-curtice-won-election-exit-pollster\" title=\"\">John Curtice </a>argued today, \u201cThere is simply no centre ground.\u201d</p> <p>Britain is split down the middle on the Brexit issue. A centrist position might arguably be to accept a soft Brexit. Yet the independents are not selling themselves as soft Brexiters but as solid remainers and advocates of the so-called people\u2019s vote. They want a second referendum in the hope that it will overturn the first. \u201cWhat is remotely centrist about this exercise?\u201d Curtice asks about the new grouping. \u201cOn Brexit they aren\u2019t centrists; they are extremists.\u201d</p> <p>This is neither a value judgment nor a trivial point. It is simply the case. Brexit has never sat neatly on the left-right spectrum. Most people on the left are remainers, but a significant minority aren\u2019t. Most on the right are leavers, but plenty are not. But the left-right spectrum is not the only spectrum that matters in modern politics. Curtice argues that the axis running from social-liberal to social-conservative is just as important nowadays. Brexit fits in more predictably there. Social liberals tend to be remainers while social conservatives are mostly leavers. In Scotland, there is also a third spectrum to take account of, in the shape of the national question.</p> <p>Seen in that light, the defining thing about the independents is therefore not that they are centrists. It is that, as remainers, they are social liberals. But that in turn means two things. First, they stand for something that alienates socially conservative voters. Second, they are not seeking to fill a large gap in the market \u2013 as they tend to claim when portraying themselves as centrists \u2013 but are competing with other existing socially liberal parties for votes. The most obvious such party is the Liberal Democrats, and the new grouping will have to decide whether they regard Vince Cable\u2019s party as part of the answer or part of the problem. Similar decisions will be needed in relation to the Greens and the Scottish and Welsh nationalist parties.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/20/independent-group-real-opposition-brexit\">The Independent Group will at last give us real opposition to Brexit | Gina Miller</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the biggest challenge for the independents is to evolve an agenda for Labour voters. In 2017, Corbyn captured very large swaths of the pro-remain, socially liberal, university-educated parts of the electorate who don\u2019t vote Lib Dem, Green or nationalist. These are precisely the people at whom the independents are aiming. But Corbyn is a leaver, not a remainer. He wants Brexit to happen. His hold on those voters is therefore at risk.</p> <p>That gives the independents a clear chance, especially if Theresa May\u2019s efforts to patch up her deal with the EU fall apart. Labour has millions of remain voters. Some Tory voters will be open to that appeal too. But the independents cannot assume that Labour remainers are all centrists in the old Blairite sense of the 1990s. The centre of gravity on the left-right axis is never stable. It must be constantly redefined in the light of changing times. And the centre has shifted a lot, as it always does. Attitudes towards nationalisation, for instance, have shifted to the left.</p> <p>This is the real challenge to the independents. They have learned the hard way that the existing party system no longer articulates the divisions and aspirations of the electorate. They know what is wrong. They have made a bold break. Now they must say what they will put in its place. They may not have long. This week\u2019s churning means an early general election just got a bit more likely.</p> <p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Back in October I had a coffee at the Tory conference with a cabinet minister who confessed: \u201cPart of me is longing for Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg to become leader so the rest of us can just leave and join a new party.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s departure of \u201cthe three amigos\u201d, as Allen called them at their press conference, does not make that much larger Tory fissure a certainty \u2013 much will depend on the Brexit endgame. But it makes it more likely. It also marks a potential watershed for the 21st-century Conservative party. When the three former Tory female MPs - and their gender is definitely part of the story -crossed the floor of the House of Commons this morning, they threw down the gauntlet to an entire generation of 21st-century Tory modernisers to either stand up or stand down. They did something else too. The sight of a group of MPs abandoning a Tory government to sit with the opposition is unusual enough. What made their move even more unusual was that the three women went straight over to sit with the seven \u2013 now eight \u2013 former Labour MPs who themselves broke with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party on Monday. By doing this they raised, in the most visible way, the possibility that these 11 independents are the outriders of a new party formed from simultaneous splits of both the two main parties in parliament. Commentators should be wary of claiming that things are without precedent. But it is genuinely hard to think of any previous new political grouping that drew on both the main parties as this one has. That was certainly not the case with the Social Democrats in 1981, who were overwhelmingly a split from Labour. Let\u2019s just agree that British party politics has witnessed something extremely unusual this week, whether it succeeds or it fails. It is tempting to see the independents as the often trailed new centre party that many have expected \u2013 and some have hoped \u2013 would emerge from the simultaneous moves of Labour to the far left under Corbyn and of the Tories to the far right in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Some of the independents see themselves that way. Sarah Wollaston was explicit that her move was \u201cabout more than Brexit\u201d, and that she foresaw a \u201cthird way\u201d grouping. The independents\u2019 website also says they aim to provide a home for refugees from both parties. Much of the commentary on this week\u2019s events will present the independents in that light. There is some truth in it. The independents have a social market ideology that slots between the extremes on the old left-right spectrum which some still use to explain our politics. They think of themselves as centrists of both the left and right. The polls show a section of the electorate \u2013 as much as 10% in the first week of their existence \u2013 has quickly embraced the new grouping. The independents would not exist except for the politics of Brexit. Frustration with Corbyn\u2019s equivocations on Brexit helped to drive the former Labour MPs into the group. Despair with the Tory right\u2019s grip on May\u2019s Brexit strategy did the equivalent for the former Conservatives. Yet on Europe, as the political scientist guru John Curtice argued today, \u201cThere is simply no centre ground.\u201d Britain is split down the middle on the Brexit issue. A centrist position might arguably be to accept a soft Brexit. Yet the independents are not selling themselves as soft Brexiters but as solid remainers and advocates of the so-called people\u2019s vote. They want a second referendum in the hope that it will overturn the first. \u201cWhat is remotely centrist about this exercise?\u201d Curtice asks about the new grouping. \u201cOn Brexit they aren\u2019t centrists; they are extremists.\u201d This is neither a value judgment nor a trivial point. It is simply the case. Brexit has never sat neatly on the left-right spectrum. Most people on the left are remainers, but a significant minority aren\u2019t. Most on the right are leavers, but plenty are not. But the left-right spectrum is not the only spectrum that matters in modern politics. Curtice argues that the axis running from social-liberal to social-conservative is just as important nowadays. Brexit fits in more predictably there. Social liberals tend to be remainers while social conservatives are mostly leavers. In Scotland, there is also a third spectrum to take account of, in the shape of the national question. Seen in that light, the defining thing about the independents is therefore not that they are centrists. It is that, as remainers, they are social liberals. But that in turn means two things. First, they stand for something that alienates socially conservative voters. Second, they are not seeking to fill a large gap in the market \u2013 as they tend to claim when portraying themselves as centrists \u2013 but are competing with other existing socially liberal parties for votes. The most obvious such party is the Liberal Democrats, and the new grouping will have to decide whether they regard Vince Cable\u2019s party as part of the answer or part of the problem. Similar decisions will be needed in relation to the Greens and the Scottish and Welsh nationalist parties. But the biggest challenge for the independents is to evolve an agenda for Labour voters. In 2017, Corbyn captured very large swaths of the pro-remain, socially liberal, university-educated parts of the electorate who don\u2019t vote Lib Dem, Green or nationalist. These are precisely the people at whom the independents are aiming. But Corbyn is a leaver, not a remainer. He wants Brexit to happen. His hold on those voters is therefore at risk. That gives the independents a clear chance, especially if Theresa May\u2019s efforts to patch up her deal with the EU fall apart. Labour has millions of remain voters. Some Tory voters will be open to that appeal too. But the independents cannot assume that Labour remainers are all centrists in the old Blairite sense of the 1990s. The centre of gravity on the left-right axis is never stable. It must be constantly redefined in the light of changing times. And the centre has shifted a lot, as it always does. Attitudes towards nationalisation, for instance, have shifted to the left. This is the real challenge to the independents. They have learned the hard way that the existing party system no longer articulates the divisions and aspirations of the electorate. They know what is wrong. They have made a bold break. Now they must say what they will put in its place. They may not have long. This week\u2019s churning means an early general election just got a bit more likely. \u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist",

Ben Wood, chief of research for CCS Insight, said: \u201cThe S9 and S9+ did not perform as well as Samsung had hoped, primarily due to them not being differentiated enough compared to the highly successful Galaxy S8 products, so it needs the S10 range to be a hit. \u201cSamsung has consistently delivered the latest features on its smartphones but the S10 portfolio needs to be super competitive to attack Apple and defend Samsung from a rampant Huawei and other Chinese brands that are aggressively looking for growth outside China.\u201d Samsung is banking buyers will be attracted to devices with top-of-the-line processors, in-display fingerprint scanners and a new triple-camera system, albeit a feature first pioneered by Huawei, offering greater levels of zoom, flexibility and low-light performance. The Galaxy S10 and S10+ have a new 16-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera, a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera and a 12-megapixel telephoto camera on the back \u2013 a similar combination used by Huawei\u2019s Mate 20 Pro to great effect. The smaller Galaxy S10 will have a 6.1in screen with a circular hole through which the 10-megapixel selfie camera will poke. The larger Galaxy S10+ has a 6.4in screen with an oval-shaped hole containing a dual-selfie camera for enhanced portraits. Both versions will have at least 128GB of storage but the top-of-the-line S10+ also comes in a special version with a ceramic back, 12GB of RAM and one terabyte storage \u2013 a first for a mainstream phone. Quite how useful that much storage will be is a moot point. It\u2019s enough to hold 500 TV shows from Netflix or up to 80 selfies taken every day for the next 10 years. And that\u2019s without adding another 512GB via the microSD card slot. They will all have a headphone socket, making them unusual for top-end phones in 2018/19, and have the ability to wirelessly charge other devices, a trick pioneered by Huawei last year. \u201cWith it being our 10th anniversary, we wanted to demonstrate meaningful innovation, to make a really strong statement that innovation in smartphones isn\u2019t dead,\u201d said Kate Beaumont, director of commercial strategy, product and planning at Samsung. Alongside the Galaxy S10 and S10+, Samsung has also launched a slightly cheaper and smaller version of its new flagship called the Galaxy S10e, which has a 5.8in screen that\u2019s flat and a more traditional capacitive fingerprint scanner on the side. A 5G version of the Galaxy S10 will also go on sale later this year to coincide with the launch of new 5G networks in the UK and elsewhere. The Galaxy S10 5G will have a larger 6.7in display and 3D depth-sensing cameras. \u201cBefore, with 4G, you had to compromise on design with the needed antennas and poor battery but not this time with 5G \u2013 you can have a true flagship phone now and be future-proofed for the next four years,\u201d Beaumont said. While 5G will remain niche, particularly in the UK in 2019, being first to market with a 5G phone is very important for Samsung, explained CCS Insight\u2019s Wood. He said: \u201cSamsung is getting the jump on arch-rival Apple, which is not expected to have a 5G iPhone until the final quarter of 2020. \u201cBut it is also important for mobile phone networks as they need a tier-one brand like Samsung to support their 5G go-to-market strategy.\u201d",

He was deputy leader of the Militant-controlled council that set an illegal budget in Liverpool in protest at local government spending cuts made by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government. On Monday it emerged he had been told he could apply to become a member again.</p> <p>Despite the intervening decades, Hatton \u2013 who was viewed as the effective leader of Militant in Liverpool despite being deputy council leader \u2013 can still prompt strong reactions across the city. The timing particularly angered centrist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> supporters because it coincided with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/18/labour-mps-split-a-clear-attempt-to-start-a-new-party\">the resignation</a> from the party of the Liverpool Wavertree MP, Luciana Berger.

Speaking in a Commons debate on antisemitism on Wednesday, the Labour MP Barry Gardiner said the decision to let him return to the party was a \u201ctravesty\u201d.</p> <p>Gardiner said he was aware of Hatton\u2019s 2012 tweet, and said in reply to another MP: \u201cI wrote to the general secretary of our party, I lodged a formal complaint, I understand that action has since been taken in respect of the complaint and I am sure that I will be looking out to see precisely what appropriate action is taken in due course.</p> <p>\u201cI totally agree with you, I think it was a travesty. Many of us knew for some while that he had applied to rejoin the party, but for the news of his readmission to come to public attention on the day, on the very day when some members of our party were forced out I think was appalling.\u201d</p>",

The 71-year-old has been suspended pending an investigation into a tweet he posted in 2012 blaming Jews for Israeli government policy. The tweet, which resurfaced after he was readmitted to the party on Monday, said: \u201cJewish people with any sense of humanity need to start speaking out publicly against the ruthless murdering being carried out by Israel!\u201d Drawing attention to the tweet, the Labour MP Ian Austin said: \u201cKeen to address the Jewish community\u2019s concerns and widespread worries that the Labour party has been taken over by a sectarian hard-left faction, the party yesterday readmitted Derek Hatton.\u201d Hatton\u2019s tweet has since been deleted. A Labour source said: \u201cDerek Hatton was given provisional membership, pending NEC approval. The party was not aware of this material. Once this was brought to our attention he was suspended pending the NEC\u2019s decision.\u201d Hatton was expelled from the party for being a member of the Trotskyist grouping Militant. He was deputy leader of the Militant-controlled council that set an illegal budget in Liverpool in protest at local government spending cuts made by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government. On Monday it emerged he had been told he could apply to become a member again. Despite the intervening decades, Hatton \u2013 who was viewed as the effective leader of Militant in Liverpool despite being deputy council leader \u2013 can still prompt strong reactions across the city. The timing particularly angered centrist Labour supporters because it coincided with the resignation from the party of the Liverpool Wavertree MP, Luciana Berger. She cited allegations of institutional antisemitism as her main reason for leaving. Hatton remains a pariah in many corners of the Labour party. Speaking in a Commons debate on antisemitism on Wednesday, the Labour MP Barry Gardiner said the decision to let him return to the party was a \u201ctravesty\u201d. Gardiner said he was aware of Hatton\u2019s 2012 tweet, and said in reply to another MP: \u201cI wrote to the general secretary of our party, I lodged a formal complaint, I understand that action has since been taken in respect of the complaint and I am sure that I will be looking out to see precisely what appropriate action is taken in due course. \u201cI totally agree with you, I think it was a travesty. Many of us knew for some while that he had applied to rejoin the party, but for the news of his readmission to come to public attention on the day, on the very day when some members of our party were forced out I think was appalling.\u201d",

Any study of China in that era remains dependent on its pioneering work.</p> <p>Born in Lahore in British India (now Pakistan), Roderick was the son of Sir Alexander MacFarquhar, a senior diplomat in the British colonial and foreign service, and his wife, Berenice (nee Whitburn). Educated at Fettes school in Edinburgh (1944-49), he did national service in the Royal Tank Regiment in Jordan before going to Keble College, Oxford, where he gained a degree in philosophy, politics and economics (1953). Then, in a life-changing move, he completed a master\u2019s degree at Harvard University under John Fairbank, the American scholar who did most in modern times to disseminate and shape the study of China in the US.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/the-cultural-revolution-50-years-on-all-you-need-to-know-about-chinas-political-convulsion\">The Cultural Revolution: all you need to know about China's political convulsion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back in London, MacFarquhar was the inaugural editor of <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/china-quarterly/roderick-macfarquhar-article-collection\" title=\"\">the China Quarterly</a> for almost a decade from 1959. He was also variously a journalist for the BBC and the Daily Telegraph, and a fellow both at Columbia University and the Royal Institute for International Affairs (Chatham House). It was while in the latter role that he produced the first volume of Origins of the Cultural Revolution, titled Contradictions Among the People 1956-1957.</p> <p>Alongside his work on China, MacFarquhar also had an active public life as a politician. Standing for the Labour party in general elections from the 60s onwards, in 1974 he was finally successful in the Derbyshire constituency of Belper, serving as a parliamentary private secretary in the Foreign Office and then the Department of Health and Social Security during the turbulent years in power of Harold Wilson and then, after his resignation in 1976, Jim Callaghan. He was also a member of the select committee on science and technology. However, MacFarquhar was swept out of parliament at the 1979 election, when Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservatives came to power, and though he later stood for South Derbyshire as a member of the newly founded Social Democratic party in 1983, he was never to hold public office again.</p> <p>Politics\u2019 loss was academia\u2019s gain: in 1983 he produced the second volume of his trilogy, which looked at Mao\u2019s <a href=\"http://countrystudies.us/china/26.htm\" title=\"\">\u201cgreat leap forward\u201d of 1958-60</a>, and followed up with four more books in the 90s on post-1949 Chinese history before, in 1997, releasing the final volume of Origins of the Cultural Revolution, titled The Coming of the Cataclysm 1961-1966.

      "bodyText": "Roderick MacFarquhar, who has died aged 88, was one of the most significant sinologists of the last 100 years, a figure who through a variety of academic posts and a series of books from the 1960s onwards opened up to the outside world the opaque machinations of elite politics in the People\u2019s Republic of China. The three volumes of his best-known book, Origins of the Cultural Revolution, published between 1974 and 1997, remain a monument of scholarship, a meticulous account of the years from the 50s onwards as Mao Zedong seemed to be growing increasingly marginalised in Beijing before his spectacular, and in many ways disastrous, comeback in 1966 at the start of the Cultural Revolution. That revolution had baffled many people outside China, but MacFarquhar was able to bring clarity to the picture by concentrating on the group of elite figures at its centre and analysing the dense set of arguments and ideological disagreements over the period that followed a falling out with the Soviet Union in 1957. The book remains definitive in its treatment of sources and the way in which it sheds light into the deeper recesses of the Chinese Communist party \u2013 something that had not been thought possible up to that point. Any study of China in that era remains dependent on its pioneering work. Born in Lahore in British India (now Pakistan), Roderick was the son of Sir Alexander MacFarquhar, a senior diplomat in the British colonial and foreign service, and his wife, Berenice (nee Whitburn). Educated at Fettes school in Edinburgh (1944-49), he did national service in the Royal Tank Regiment in Jordan before going to Keble College, Oxford, where he gained a degree in philosophy, politics and economics (1953). Then, in a life-changing move, he completed a master\u2019s degree at Harvard University under John Fairbank, the American scholar who did most in modern times to disseminate and shape the study of China in the US. Back in London, MacFarquhar was the inaugural editor of the China Quarterly for almost a decade from 1959. He was also variously a journalist for the BBC and the Daily Telegraph, and a fellow both at Columbia University and the Royal Institute for International Affairs (Chatham House). It was while in the latter role that he produced the first volume of Origins of the Cultural Revolution, titled Contradictions Among the People 1956-1957. Alongside his work on China, MacFarquhar also had an active public life as a politician. Standing for the Labour party in general elections from the 60s onwards, in 1974 he was finally successful in the Derbyshire constituency of Belper, serving as a parliamentary private secretary in the Foreign Office and then the Department of Health and Social Security during the turbulent years in power of Harold Wilson and then, after his resignation in 1976, Jim Callaghan. He was also a member of the select committee on science and technology. However, MacFarquhar was swept out of parliament at the 1979 election, when Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservatives came to power, and though he later stood for South Derbyshire as a member of the newly founded Social Democratic party in 1983, he was never to hold public office again. Politics\u2019 loss was academia\u2019s gain: in 1983 he produced the second volume of his trilogy, which looked at Mao\u2019s \u201cgreat leap forward\u201d of 1958-60, and followed up with four more books in the 90s on post-1949 Chinese history before, in 1997, releasing the final volume of Origins of the Cultural Revolution, titled The Coming of the Cataclysm 1961-1966. He did much of his writing while working as director, from 1986 to 1992, of an institute at Harvard named after his former teacher, the Fairbank Centre for China Studies. He then became professor of history and political science at the same university until 2012. MacFarquhar was active into his seventh decade in working on China, co-authoring his final book, Mao\u2019s Last Revolution (2006), with the Swedish sinologist Michael Schoenhals \u2013 a work that displayed characteristic attention to detail and an ability to craft a compelling narrative. As a teacher MacFarquhar educated various generations of scholars on China, not only from Europe and the US but from across the world. He was also, despite the sensitivity of some of the issues he tackled, able to enjoy good access within China itself, and his translated work was available there at least up to the 2000s. Unfailingly patient and kind, he managed throughout his career to avoid the usual complaints of fractiousness sometimes levied at prominent academics and remained respected both as a scholar and as a human being. He married Emily Cohen in 1964; she died in 2001. He is survived by his second wife, Dalena Wright, whom he married in 2012, and the children from his first marriage, Larissa and Rory. \u2022 Roderick Lemonde MacFarquhar, sinologist, born 2 December 1930; died 10 February 2019",

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Sajid Javid, has announced plans to revoke the citizenship of the Islamic State recruit Shamima Begum. If the order proves successful, she will join the ranks of around 120 suspected jihadists and criminals since 2016 who have been stripped of their British nationality and banned from returning to the UK. El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey, who were raised in Britain, are alleged to have been part of an Isis terror cell, known as \u201cthe Beatles\u201d, responsible for the brutal killings of western captives in Syria and Iraq, including the British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines and the US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. The security minister, Ben Wallace, confirmed both men had been stripped of their citizenship in July 2018. Sudan-born Elsheikh, a mechanic from White City in London, came to the UK as a child when his family were granted refugee status. He travelled to Syria in 2012 and joined al-Qaida and later a splinter group that became Isis. Kotey, born in London, is half-Ghanaian, half-Greek Cypriot, and grew up in Shepherd\u2019s Bush. Believed to have converted to Islam in his early 20s, he left behind two young children in Britain. Mahdi Hashi Mahdi Hashi came to the UK from Somalia when he was five with his parents. The family were granted asylum and subsequently became British citizens. He grew up in Camden, north London, and became a care worker after finishing school. He subsequently became involved in the al-Shabaab group. In 2009, aged 19, Hashi claimed MI5 was trying to blackmail him into becoming an informer. Later that year, he moved to Somalia. He was never charged with any crime in the UK. In 2012, the then home secretary, Theresa May, ordered that he be stripped of British citizenship on the grounds that he was involved in Islamic extremism. Hashi is currently in jail in New York on terror charges. Bilal al-Berjawi Bilal al-Berjawi was born in Lebanon and grew up in St John\u2019s Wood. He was suspected of being involved with al-Qaida militants in Somalia. In 2006, at the age of 22, he attended an al-Qaida training camp in Mogadishu where he learned to use explosives and was thought to be part of an extremist group known as the \u201cLondon boys\u201d. He was detained on suspicion of terrorist offences in 2009 with another Briton, Mohammed Sakr, following a trip to Kenya. His British citizenship was revoked in 2010, at which point he and Sakr were thought to hold senior positions in a militant group linked to al-Qaida. A terror suspect, he was subject to strict surveillance from US services and MI5, and at one point was on a US kill list. He died in a drone strike, shortly after his wife in London gave birth to their first son. Mohamed Sakr Mohamed Sakr was born and brought up in London.

He exemplified how to live. When we worked together he used to call me \u2018the DJ\u2019 because I always had music with me, and Karl loved music. He was like Peter Pan, like a 14-year-old boy. He liked to have the music so loud that you couldn\u2019t speak.\u201d The usually flamboyant Michele cut an unusually downbeat figure as he addressed the storm of criticism Gucci has faced for the \u201cblackface\u201d balaclava-style sweater, featuring outsize red lips, which was withdrawn from sale earlier this month. \u201cI am very sorry. From my grief, I will learn something. We will learn a lesson and this company will do things in a different way,\u201d he said. Marco Bizzarri, Gucci\u2019s chief executive, who has said the mistake was caused \u201cbecause of cultural ignorance, but ignorance is not an excuse\u201d, has committed to improving diversity at the company. The debacle is one of a series of racism scandals that have highlighted how a lack of diversity in both creative and management positions at Italian fashion brands has allowed cultural insensitivity to run unchecked. In December, Prada was forced to withdraw from sale monkey figurines that resembled blackface. With one week to go before its catwalk show on Thursday, Prada announced the launch of a diversity and inclusion action committee, chaired by the US artist Theaster Gates and the film-maker Ava DuVernay, which aims to \u201celevate voices of colour in the fashion industry\u201d by improving the diversity of Prada\u2019s workforce. Dolce &amp; Gabbana\u2019s show on Sunday will be its first since a Shanghai event was cancelled in a racism row that caused a huge backlash against the brand in China. \u201cFashion is a very direct form of culture,\u201d said Michele after his show. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to go to a library to experience it, it comes to all of us.\u201d Gender fluidity runs through the Gucci aesthetic. Male models in this show wore cinch waists and high heels, while women wore oversized blazers. Masks signifying hermaphrodite deities were a reference, Michele said, \u201cto the ancient world, where being between two sexes was praised, and masks made to celebrate what was thought to be a blessing\u201d. Clothes are always costume at Michele\u2019s Gucci. But among the maximalist dreamscape of clashing colours and rhinestoned slogans were signs of fashion\u2019s latest directions. Exaggerated high-waisted trouser silhouettes, double-breasted blazers, colourful trainers and bibbed necklines were details from this collection whose influence will be felt on the high street.",

Labour is correct to recognise that while prejudice against Jewish people is deplorable, criticism of Israel\u2019s government and policies can and must be made.</p> <p>We urge all who wish to see an

      "bodyText": "You report (19 February) that a number of implacably anti-Corbyn MPs have left the Labour party alleging a failed \u201capproach to dealing with antisemitism\u201d, with Luciana Berger criticising Labour for becoming \u201csickeningly institutionally racist\u201d. We are Jewish members and supporters of the Labour party concerned about the current rise of reactionary ideologies, including antisemitism, in Britain and elsewhere across Europe. We note the worrying growth of populist rightwing parties, encouraging racism, Islamophobia and antisemitism. In Britain the far right is whipping up these prejudices, a threat that requires a resolute and energetic response. But instead we have seen a disproportionate focus on antisemitism on the left, which is abhorrent but relatively rare. We believe that the Labour party under the progressive leadership of Jeremy Corbyn is a crucial ally in the fight against bigotry and reaction. His lifetime record of campaigning for equality and human rights, including consistent support for initiatives against antisemitism, is formidable. His involvement strengthens this struggle. Labour governments introduced both the anti-racist and human rights legislation of the 20th century and the 2010 Equalities Act. A Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn will be a powerful force to fight against racism, Islamophobia and antisemitism. It is in this context that we welcome the Labour party\u2019s endorsement of freedom of expression on Israel and on the rights of Palestinians. Labour is correct to recognise that while prejudice against Jewish people is deplorable, criticism of Israel\u2019s government and policies can and must be made. We urge all who wish to see an end to bigotry and racism, and who seek a more just society, to give their support to the Labour party.

      "body": "<p>The pro-European wing of the Conservative party has traditionally been more loyal to its leaders and more inclined towards compromise than the Eurosceptic faction. That is one reason why Wednesday\u2019s decision by three remain-supporting Tory MPs to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/20/tory-mps-defect-independent-group-soubry-allen-wollaston\" title=\"\">abandon their party</a> in despair was so significant, if not surprising.</p> <p>EU issues have tested Conservative unity for a generation, but it is still a dramatic step from dissent to schism. The choice by Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston to sit as independent MPs is symptomatic of more than disagreement with Theresa May over policy. It expresses more than distress at the way Brexit has been handled. It is the ideological and cultural trajectory of the Conservative party \u2013 its capture by an extreme faction \u2013 that has led the schismatic MPs to feel they can no longer in good conscience fly its colours. This would be remarkable under any circumstances. Coming in the same week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/19/joan-ryan-eighth-labour-mp-quits-party-to-join-breakaway-independent-group\" title=\"\">eight Labour MPs</a> made an equivalent decision to abandon their party, it is extraordinary.</p> <p>With 11 MPs, the newly formed \u201cindependent group\u201d marshals as many votes in the Commons as the Liberal Democrats and one more than the DUP. It is not clear how those numbers will be deployed (the group is more easily identified by what it is against than what it is for) but one obvious consequence of Tory defections is that the government\u2019s majority shrinks.</p> <p>Mrs May might well conclude that she is now even more dependent on the votes of hardline Eurosceptics and Ulster unionists to secure a Brexit deal. It would be sadly in keeping with past behaviour if she were to respond to political adversity by digging deeper into an already narrow trench, mortgaging the country\u2019s future still further to people who have never shown her durable loyalty. That would be a tactical mistake and a misreading of the moment.</p> <p>It was not the simple prospect of Britain\u2019s departure from the EU that propelled the defectors from the Conservative party. They all voted in favour of triggering the article 50 withdrawal process in 2017. There is no reason to disbelieve them when they say the bonds of allegiance were broken by the prime minister\u2019s pursuit of a needlessly hard model of Brexit and her refusal to hear moderate voices, even from her own side of the Commons. They also condemn the government for failing to address the grievances that drove support for Brexit in the first place or heal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/10/brexit-divides-tensions-political-vote\" title=\"\">divisions</a> exposed by the 2016 referendum campaign.</p> <p>That criticism is all the more damaging to Mrs May since she once declared the pursuit of social justice to be her greatest priority in Downing Street. Instead she has persuaded once loyal MPs that the Tory party itself is incapable of leading a national healing process. The prime minister should be determined to prove them wrong, not for the sake of her pride but because the country would be better served if she switched to a more consensual approach. The hardline Eurosceptics whom Mrs May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/30/the-guardian-view-on-may-and-the-tories-choosing-unity-over-reality\" title=\"\">indulges</a> cannot claim to speak on behalf of everyone who voted for Brexit, let alone the whole country.</p> <p>Yet the prime minister accepted their narrow interpretation of the referendum result and thereby accelerated their ideological capture of her party. It is too late to woo the defectors back, but it is not too late to recognise the truth in their bleak account of what the Tories are becoming under her leadership \u2013 a dogmatic, intolerant, anti-European sect that has lost all sight of how to govern in the national interest.

      "bodyText": "The pro-European wing of the Conservative party has traditionally been more loyal to its leaders and more inclined towards compromise than the Eurosceptic faction. That is one reason why Wednesday\u2019s decision by three remain-supporting Tory MPs to abandon their party in despair was so significant, if not surprising. EU issues have tested Conservative unity for a generation, but it is still a dramatic step from dissent to schism. The choice by Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston to sit as independent MPs is symptomatic of more than disagreement with Theresa May over policy. It expresses more than distress at the way Brexit has been handled. It is the ideological and cultural trajectory of the Conservative party \u2013 its capture by an extreme faction \u2013 that has led the schismatic MPs to feel they can no longer in good conscience fly its colours. This would be remarkable under any circumstances. Coming in the same week that eight Labour MPs made an equivalent decision to abandon their party, it is extraordinary. With 11 MPs, the newly formed \u201cindependent group\u201d marshals as many votes in the Commons as the Liberal Democrats and one more than the DUP. It is not clear how those numbers will be deployed (the group is more easily identified by what it is against than what it is for) but one obvious consequence of Tory defections is that the government\u2019s majority shrinks. Mrs May might well conclude that she is now even more dependent on the votes of hardline Eurosceptics and Ulster unionists to secure a Brexit deal. It would be sadly in keeping with past behaviour if she were to respond to political adversity by digging deeper into an already narrow trench, mortgaging the country\u2019s future still further to people who have never shown her durable loyalty. That would be a tactical mistake and a misreading of the moment. It was not the simple prospect of Britain\u2019s departure from the EU that propelled the defectors from the Conservative party. They all voted in favour of triggering the article 50 withdrawal process in 2017. There is no reason to disbelieve them when they say the bonds of allegiance were broken by the prime minister\u2019s pursuit of a needlessly hard model of Brexit and her refusal to hear moderate voices, even from her own side of the Commons. They also condemn the government for failing to address the grievances that drove support for Brexit in the first place or heal divisions exposed by the 2016 referendum campaign. That criticism is all the more damaging to Mrs May since she once declared the pursuit of social justice to be her greatest priority in Downing Street. Instead she has persuaded once loyal MPs that the Tory party itself is incapable of leading a national healing process. The prime minister should be determined to prove them wrong, not for the sake of her pride but because the country would be better served if she switched to a more consensual approach. The hardline Eurosceptics whom Mrs May indulges cannot claim to speak on behalf of everyone who voted for Brexit, let alone the whole country. Yet the prime minister accepted their narrow interpretation of the referendum result and thereby accelerated their ideological capture of her party. It is too late to woo the defectors back, but it is not too late to recognise the truth in their bleak account of what the Tories are becoming under her leadership \u2013 a dogmatic, intolerant, anti-European sect that has lost all sight of how to govern in the national interest. If Mrs May does not want that to be her legacy she is running out of time to do something about it.",

      "bodyText": "Guitarist Todd Wisenbaker, who has collaborated with Ryan Adams, is one of a number of musicians who have condemned the singer-songwriter after seven women alleged emotional and verbal abuse and harassment in a New York Times investigation published last week. Actor and musician Mandy Moore, who was married to Adams, and musician Phoebe Bridgers, who had a relationship with him, were among the women who spoke to the Times, alongside a fan who says she was underage when he began to send her explicit messages online. Adams has described the report as \u201cupsettingly inaccurate \u2026 some of its details are misrepresented; some are exaggerated; some are outright false. I would never have inappropriate interactions with someone I thought was underage.\u201d In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Wisenbaker said speaking out was \u201cincredibly hard\u201d, and that he was \u201cactively afraid for the safety of my family\u201d. Wisenbaker has performed live with Adams, played on his cover album of Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989, and was recording new music with him last year, according to NME. He said he \u201crecently learned that pretty much everything [Adams] ever told me is a lie upon a lie upon a lie\u201d. \u201cThere were times when I chose to believe his insane version of the truth because it was easier than believing that anyone is capable of being this much of a monster. It\u2019s sickening and embarrassing \u2026 my life has become a complete shitstorm of someone else\u2019s utter delusion.\u201d He posted the message on Instagram with the caption, \u201cRyan please get help.\u201d Adams has not commented on Wisenbaker\u2019s post. Adams produced the latest album from La Sera, a band founded by Vivian Girls\u2019 former bassist Katy Goodman, which Wisenbaker, her husband, plays in. On Tuesday, Goodman also posted on Instagram, \u201cBelieve the women who have told their stories about Ryan Adams.\u201d After the Times published the initial report, an unnamed law enforcement official told the paper that the FBI\u2019s Crimes Against Children Squad is investigating whether Adams committed a crime by engaging in allegedly sexually explicit communications with a teenage girl.

I asked John Farrand of the Guild of Fine Food if vegan cheese would ever be included, and he said it was unlikely.

Perhaps as a result, they are well aware of vegan cheese\u2019s reputation, saying it has been earned by lower-quality products that are overly reliant on coconut oil. It can smell \u201creally like feet\u201d, says Charlotte. \u201cYou do feel like you\u2019re missing out, and getting a worse version.\u201d</p> <p>The products they stock are mostly nut-based and made by small suppliers, and the sisters are confident they will win me over.

At one point one sister refers to a \u201cgoat\u201d variety. <a href=\"https://thekindaco.com/\" title=\"\">The Kinda Co</a>, meanwhile, offers a <a href=\"https://thekindaco.com/products/faux-lox-dill-cream-cheese\" title=\"\">\u201cfaux lox and dill\u201d cream cheese</a>, with baked and marinated carrots standing in for salmon. I don\u2019t like the taste of salmon myself, so the absence of fishy essence makes this perfectly palatable, and even tasty, smeared on an oatcake \u2013 but I\u2019m perhaps not best placed to judge.</p> <p>Next is Kinda Co\u2019s Farmhouse Spread, a cream cheese with a cashew-based, cheddar-inspired <a href=\"https://thekindaco.com/products/farmhouse-spread\" title=\"\">\u201cauthentic, cheesy taste\u201d</a>. Charlotte says she can\u2019t get enough of it, and that the solid equivalent is the sisters\u2019 go-to recommendation for customers who come in seeking a \u201cconverter cheese\u201d. Listening back to my recording of our interview, the diplomacy with which I deliver my verdict (\u201cIt\u2019s, uhhhhhhhhh, flavoursome\u201d) is painfully audible.</p> <p>I am keen to try the solid \u201cFarmhouse\u201d \u2013 which is compared to a West Country cheddar, but it is sold out. <a href=\"https://thekindaco.com/products/farmhouse\" title=\"\">At \u00a35.99 for around 120g</a>, this may be an endorsement.</p> <p>Seventy per cent of customers come into La Fauxmagerie looking for a cheddar, a blue, or a camembert, says Charlotte, with the latter especially difficult to offer in terms of both taste and value for money. \u201cI would rather have someone not buy camembert than get home after having spent \u00a310 and say: \u2018Vegan cheese sucks.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She and Rachel are trying Mouse\u2019s Favourite Aged Blue, a cashew-based \u201ccamblue\u201d, with me for the first time.

For Charlotte, it is just right.</p> <p>Perhaps it\u2019s the camera trained up my nostrils, perhaps it\u2019s that cheese is not strictly logical \u2013 but as I bite down I struggle to explain what I think of the camblue.

As I then explained about a million times on Twitter, I was joking: I do not hate Meghan, or even consider her vaguely hateful. I could no more despise the woman than I could flick through the pages of a magazine and take against a salt-and-pepper male model with a watch on. She wasn\u2019t the point; the point was that society quests ceaselessly for an enemy, and if you\u2019re going to have one, at least let it be one who probably won\u2019t care.</p> <p>This was right in an ambient, premonitory way, but I was wrong to think it was funny. The poor woman is being vilified round the clock \u2013 this week for having the audacity to have a baby shower with her friends in New York. It has gone beyond the point of mattering what her personality is like, were anyone in any position to know: she would have to be so thoroughly bad to warrant this level of scrutiny, so devoid of human feeling, so malicious in every intention, that the media\u2019s daily censure wouldn\u2019t be enough. We\u2019d have to paint her yellow and black like a bee.</p> <p>She can\u2019t leave the house, pregnant, without being accused of \u201cflaunting\u201d her bump. She can\u2019t walk into a room without wild speculation about whether or not she breached a protocol, by people who have no idea what royal protocols are. If a friend comes to her defence and asks people to stop hounding her, then who does she think she is, having a friend like that?

      "bodyText": "Last month I nominated Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, as a hate figure for the nation in 2019: the person we all need to get us through a difficult time, like your cousin\u2019s girlfriend who waxes her eyebrows and yammers on about yoga at the start of a fraught Christmas. As I then explained about a million times on Twitter, I was joking: I do not hate Meghan, or even consider her vaguely hateful. I could no more despise the woman than I could flick through the pages of a magazine and take against a salt-and-pepper male model with a watch on. She wasn\u2019t the point; the point was that society quests ceaselessly for an enemy, and if you\u2019re going to have one, at least let it be one who probably won\u2019t care. This was right in an ambient, premonitory way, but I was wrong to think it was funny. The poor woman is being vilified round the clock \u2013 this week for having the audacity to have a baby shower with her friends in New York. It has gone beyond the point of mattering what her personality is like, were anyone in any position to know: she would have to be so thoroughly bad to warrant this level of scrutiny, so devoid of human feeling, so malicious in every intention, that the media\u2019s daily censure wouldn\u2019t be enough. We\u2019d have to paint her yellow and black like a bee. She can\u2019t leave the house, pregnant, without being accused of \u201cflaunting\u201d her bump. She can\u2019t walk into a room without wild speculation about whether or not she breached a protocol, by people who have no idea what royal protocols are. If a friend comes to her defence and asks people to stop hounding her, then who does she think she is, having a friend like that? OK, so maybe it is George Clooney. Someone\u2019s got to be his friend. He might be perfectly nice. If she smiles for the cameras, then she\u2019s luxuriating in the attention. \u201cShe\u2019s being victimised, you say, George; you with your fancy hair and your coffee habits \u2026 then why is she smiling? Riddle me that.\u201d If she goes to New York, she\u2019s pointedly \u201cwithout Prince Harry\u201d. But if she had taken Prince Harry, then you can guarantee that she would have been dragging her husband away from his duties, to partake of her frivolity, and what kind of princelet might she raise with priorities like that?

From Notre Dame Collegiate school in Leeds, she went to Girton College, Cambridge, and in 1964 graduated in genetics. Three years later she qualified in medicine at UCL. After clinical training in Liverpool and Huddersfield she spent a year with the Save the Children Fund in Algeria. Her decision to become a research scientist was triggered by an earlier overland trip to India, which yielded her first paper on the genetics of leprosy, and by a stint in the laboratory of the renowned human geneticist Harry Harris, whose group at the MRC Human Biochemical Genetics Unit at UCL she joined as a staff member in 1970. She remained at UCL for the rest of her career, becoming Haldane professor of human genetics in 2000. Unassuming at first sight, Sue could be fierce in defence of her principles, taking on a whole committee if necessary. To enable her staff and students to attend international meetings, she would often travel at very low cost herself. Several of her students, many of them women, are now professors or in leading professional roles. Holidays were generally extensions of work trips to interesting countries where she could walk and enjoy the fauna, flora and terrain with colleagues. Sue is survived by her brother, Phil, and nephew, Ian. \u2022 Margaret Susan Povey, human geneticist, born 24 April 1942; died 11 January 2019",

      "bodyText": "1395: Dressed in women\u2019s clothes and working as a prostitute This plea and memoranda roll from the 14th century describes how John Rykener, under the name Eleanor, and John Britby were arrested near Cheapside in the City of London. Rykener was dressed in women\u2019s clothes and working as a prostitute, while Britby had paid for his services. When Rykener was brought before the mayor and aldermen of the City of London, a complex story emerged. Living and working as a woman, he had slept with many men and women, including members of the church and gentry. Considered by some to be a piece of satirical writing, mocking the clergy and gentry, the official document suggests otherwise. Read the transcript. 1533: Buggery Act The Buggery Act, passed during the reign of Henry VIII, moved the issue of sodomy from the ecclesiastical courts to the state. The act did not explicitly target homosexual acts between men, as it also applied to sodomy between men and women and a person with an animal. However, male homosexual convictions were the most common and publicised. Convictions under the Buggery Act were punishable by death. 1762: Molly and the pillory \u201cMolly\u201d was slang for homosexual men. A common punishment for homosexual men was to be placed in the pillory, where they would be pelted with excrement, rubbish, rotting vegetables, stones and even dead animals. Pillories were positioned in busy areas and missiles were provided. People were put in the pillory for hours each day, over three days. Frequently they suffered head injuries, and some were blinded, knocked unconscious or even killed. This image is from a ballad sheet, a souvenir designed to be sold to spectators containing words to be sung to a well-known tune. Here\u2019s a full version. 1828: Offences Against the Person Act The Buggery Act was among the laws repealed and replaced by the 1828 Offences Against the Person Act. The new language focused on male same-sex activity explicitly, while the Buggery Act had applied to men and women collectively. Homosexual acts between men remained punishable by death. 1947: Albertine Winner\u2019s Homosexuality in Women Albertine Winner, the first female deputy chief medical officer at the Department of Health, wrote in Homosexuality in Women: \u201cThere are two categories of female homosexuals \u2026 the woman who tends to prefer the society of women \u2026 and a much more dangerous type, the promiscuous Lesbian who \u2026 may cause great harm and unhappiness.\u201d 1951: The first transgender woman to undergo appropriate plastic surgery in the UK Roberta Cowell (AKA Robert Cowell), an ex-Spitfire pilot and father of two who doctors had found to be a woman with male genitalia, had surgery to revert to her true sex in March 1954. Her parents issued a statement of support, as reported by the Guardian. 1955: The Problem of Homosexuality Clergy, doctors and lawyers led by the Rev Dr Derrick Sherwin Bailey produced the privately printed The Problem of Homosexuality in 1955. Addressing the Church of England\u2019s role in law reform, it recognised the state\u2019s role in regulating society but acknowledged the violation of the rights of homosexual people. It pointed to evidence of the suicide of men who had been charged with committing homosexual acts with an adult, saying: \u201cThe sense of shame at public exposure appears to be a motive \u2026 if the law is unjust, then the longer it remains responsible for human tragedy, the more inexcusable does its retention become.\u201d 1957: Wolfenden report The Wolfenden committee recommended that \u201chomosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence\u201d. Despite support from the archbishop of Canterbury, the government rejected the report. 1964: Campaign for Homosexual Equality established This poster was produced for the Campaign for Homosexual Equality to highlight the inequities faced by LGBT people, particularly in the armed forces. Until 1994 homosexual conduct in the forces remained a criminal offence, and after 1994 homosexual conduct was no longer treated as criminal but would still lead to discharge. In 2000, the law was finally changed to end the discrimination against LGBT people serving in the armed forces. 1967: Sexual Offences Act This law stated: \u201cA homosexual act in private shall not be an offence provided that the parties consent thereto and have attained the age of twenty-one years.\u201d However, private acts were not legal if more than two people were present. Although the act marked a change, it still meant people did not have sexual freedom and could not enjoy a free and open relationship with a person of the same sex. Here\u2019s how 1967 changed gay life in Britain. 1977: Mary Whitehouse v Gay News Mary Whitehouse, founder of the Nationwide Festival of Light and the National Viewers\u2019 and Listeners\u2019 Association, took Gay News to trial for blasphemy, in the first such case for 40 years. Gay News had published a homoerotic poem about Jesus by James Kirkup titled The Love That Dare Not Speak Its Name. Denis Lemon, founder of Gay News, ultimately lost the case. 1983: Jenny Lives With Eric and Martin published in UK Jenny Lives With Eric and Martin by Susanne Bosche describes a few days in the life of a five-year-old named Jenny, her father, Martin, and his boyfriend Eric who lives with them. When it was reported that the book had been found in a school library, a moral panic ensued. The issue escalated to the highest levels of government and resulted in Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, under which councils were prohibited from intentionally promoting homosexuality \u2013 resulting in funding being withdrawn from arts projects and educational resources. Section 28 remained enforceable until 2003. 1984: Changing the World \u2013 A London Charter for Gay and Lesbian Rights The Greater London council (GLC) supported and funded numerous projects that promoted equal opportunities. In 1984 it published Changing the World: A London Charter for Gay and Lesbian Rights. This explained the idea of heterosexism and its impact on LGBT people. A year later the GLC funded the opening of the London Gay and Lesbian Centre, where people could meet and get advice. 1986: London Strategic Policy Unit and HIV/Aids The first UK case of Aids was recorded in 1982, when a 49-year-old man was admitted to hospital in London suffering from pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. He died 10 days later. The London strategic policy unit sought to provide clear information to demystify HIV/Aids, to show how it affected everybody and to ease the public\u2019s fear of being in contact with those living with the disease. 1987: Galop newsletter A newsletter from Galop, which was founded in 1982 to expose discrimination in the police\u2019s treatment of gay and lesbian people. Police carried out raids on LGBT venues in \u201cspace suits\u201d and rubber gloves for fear of contracting Aids. Arrests were often based on public order rather than sexual offences. This meant pubs, clubs and other venues could be closed, and people feared losing their livelihoods. 1988: Ian McKellen marches against Section 28 The actor Ian McKellen was among those at the forefront of the campaign against Section 28 legislation. In 1989 he co-founded Stonewall, a group renowned for its campaigning and lobbying for LGBT rights. Read more: Anti-Gay Law \u2018Is a Legal Non-Starter\u2019, Christian Wolmar, The Observer, 22 May 1988. 1990: Outrage Outrage, a British LGBT rights group committed to nonviolent, direct action and civil disobedience, was founded following the murders of several gay men in London. The stickers address a variety of causes such as equal parenting, anti-heterosexism and an end to homophobia. 1990: Lesbians and Policing Project pamphlet A pamphlet produced by the Lesbians and Policing Project outlining police powers of arrest and individual rights when arrested. Also gives contact numbers for the London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard. 2001: Age of consent for gay men lowered to 16 In 1994 MP Edwina Currie\u2019s amendment to lower the age of consent for gay men from 21 to 16 was defeated and it was lowered to 18 instead. The lesbian age of consent was not set. Seven years later, and after three defeats in the House of Lords, the Labour government forced through legislation lowering the age of consent for gay men to 16. 2013: Marriage (Same-sex Couples) Act The Civil Partnership Act 2004 had given same-sex couples the same rights as married heterosexual couples in the UK, but they were not permitted to marry. The Marriage (Same-sex Couples) Act gave same-sex couples the opportunity to get married. 2017: Policing and Crime Act \u2013 the \u2018Alan Turing law\u2019 Alan Turing, the mathematician who broke the German Enigma codes during the second world war, was granted a posthumous royal pardon in 2013 after he had previously been convicted of \u201cgross indecency\u201d and was chemically castrated. The Policing and Crime Act 2017 served as an amnesty law to pardon all historical instances of criminal convictions of gross indecency against men and has become known as the \u201cAlan Turing law\u201d. It only applies to convictions in England and Wales; campaign for the pardon to be implemented in Scotland and Northern Ireland is ongoing. Coverage from the Guardian.

It then expects wages to be growing at 3% by June 2020: If they fail to get there \u2013 and also fail to see employment growing as fast as they hope \u2013 then the current budget revenue predictions will also fall short. And the problem with the recent wages growth data is that even though growth is better than a year ago we appear to have completely shifted to a new scenario where the old wages growth of above 3% would require much better economic conditions than was the case in the past.

But for 20 years the film wasn\u2019t even allowed in the country: it was banned by the Australian Classification Board, with the ban only being lifted in 2006. In the cool, calm light of 2019 it seems ludicrous that a film like this, a gory but broad black comedy starring Dennis Hopper, a sequel to Hooper\u2019s 1974 film of the same name, could be deemed unfit for the delicate sensibilities of Australian audiences. But then and now, both the Board and the Australian Federal Police took the importing of contraband media very seriously. An acquaintance of mine discovered just that when he tried to mail order a bootleg copy of the film on video back in 1988.

I\u2019m worried that her health is deteriorating as she ages and really, she needs to be moved over here, closer to myself and her grandchildren, in Western Australia. I wonder how we are going to manage this move, both logistically and financially. The disability support pension my mother receives isn\u2019t much more welcoming than the Newstart allowance I receive, and while I can manage to juggle things enough to order some nonperishable grocery items for her, an interstate move is going to be a big issue.</p> <p>Once again, though, I am struck with the thought that there is always someone worse off than myself and it is humbling indeed.</p> <p>At the same time, I\u2019ve also experienced another change in care for one of my teenagers, which again alters the benefit rates. And for reasons known only to the Department of Human Services and Centrelink in particular, I\u2019ve been informed that the duration of my course of study requires \u201ccoding differently now\u201d, which means I now need to be swapped over to Austudy.

My \u201cincome\u201d after housing costs may now drop down to $200 per week. I wonder if I can get through my course quicker and what this will take. Can I juggle my work at the stables with more hours of study, less sleep and more stress in general? As I chop fresh homegrown tomatoes and cucumbers I ponder my own health and the instructions from my doctor today to rest my injured shoulder or it will deteriorate more. This rest certainly isn\u2019t possible in my current situation. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I want my children to know that sometimes sacrifices are necessary so that others can reach their potential</p> <footer> <cite>Tara Rose</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I feel like I\u2019m being penalised for studying to reskill and provide for my small family and get back into the paid workforce. The notion that there is no huge incentive or assistance for mature-aged people to do so also floats around my mind and I have to actively dampen down the anxiety and guilt around this. Realistically, my course will not finish until the end of this year and I feel throughout this time, I will be at the mercy of the Centrelink system. I am incredibly thankful that I am able to receive a benefit, but equally stressed at the constant financial juggle.</p> <p>I take a small comfort in knowing this particular chapter in my life won\u2019t be forever and the increased self-awareness and insights will stay with me for life. Whenever I weigh up my decisions, options, circumstances and my path forward, I always try to come back to this question: what legacy am I leaving my children?</p> <p>Right now my legacy is still showing my children the value, or lack thereof, of possession, of money, friendships, relationships, of having as strong work ethic and being compassionate and generous with everything that we have and who we are. I want them to know that sometimes, sacrifices are necessary so that others can reach their potential, and that while things might be tough right now, it won\u2019t always be like this. I want them to be able to ask for help in life when they need it and to know that there isn\u2019t anything wrong with doing so. I want them to live through the negative stigmas that they will inevitably encounter in their lives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bbbfafdbdbc9eea697b2772656899e44d1d2d828\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbbfafdbdbc9eea697b2772656899e44d1d2d828/0_275_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u0091A women who is known as Tara - a writer for the series \u201cLife On the Breadline\u201d.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Right now my legacy is still showing my children the value, or lack thereof, of possession, of money.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Dare Parker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I hope one day they will look at these articles written by all of us <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/life-on-the-breadline\">Life on the breadline</a> writers and be thankful for what they have in spite of what they don\u2019t have, and still be humble. I am sure they will feel embarrassed that I have shared our lives with complete strangers but I hope they will understand the reason I have done so. Hopefully they will see that behind all of the written word, the stories told, the stigmas faced and the personal struggles endured, that we are all human and everyone deserves to be heard, to have safe housing, food on the table and access to healthcare, whether they have a university degree and high-paying job, are studying and in receipt of a benefit while they try to improve their life or can no longer work for medical reasons.</p> <p>If my children can walk through life not judging people for what they have and how they came by it, but rather with an open mind, a caring heart and with compassion, then I feel that this particular journey, this project, will have been completely worthwhile. Likewise, if readers can also see the humans behind these articles, and be more understanding and accepting of peoples\u2019 stories, then I feel this project will have been a huge success. We, the writers, will have given voice to those who are reliant on Centrelink, regardless of the reasons.</p> <p>There is still a subtle simmering of my emotions as I near the end of this final piece in the project. I think back to my now plentiful vegetable garden. When I was penning my first piece for you all, I was struggling with the cost of my water bill, trying to balance out that cost with the benefits that I received from time in my garden and the promise of fresh, homegrown fruit and vegetables. I second-guessed myself when some suggested I should just give up the garden for a cheaper water bill. I am proud that I stuck with it, and we now enjoy fresh garden salads with the vegetables grown and healthy fruit. The mental health benefits are as plentiful as the vegetables and fruit grown, and I can get some much-needed downtime in tending to the plants.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/27/life-on-the-breadline-i-lie-awake-wondering-what-else-i-can-sacrifice\">Life on the breadline: I lie awake wondering what else I can sacrifice | Tara Rose</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Watching my daughter grow emotionally and socially and gain life skills, becoming more independent, dedicated and disciplined in her pursuits as she inches a little further towards her dreams and goals, with her equine companion and therapist by her side, I am reassured that my hours spent working at the stables, caring for others\u2019 horses and teaching horse riding is worth it. I still work in return for the agistment of our horses, mine aged and retired and my daughter\u2019s young and full of potential, the benefits far outweighing the sacrifices I make.</p> <p>My little family is not exactly where I want us to be, and in fact we may never be, but we are further ahead of where we were. Maybe this time next year I will be off the Centrelink roundabout and will be in a better position to provide more for my children amd give back more to my community. If we aren\u2019t though, then I will continue forwards with the notion that there is always someone worse off. I hope the powers that be will take the time to read the articles within this project, really see the readers when they describe the struggles, and raise the rates of benefits that we try to survive on.

The notion that there is no huge incentive or assistance for mature-aged people to do so also floats around my mind and I have to actively dampen down the anxiety and guilt around this. Realistically, my course will not finish until the end of this year and I feel throughout this time, I will be at the mercy of the Centrelink system. I am incredibly thankful that I am able to receive a benefit, but equally stressed at the constant financial juggle. I take a small comfort in knowing this particular chapter in my life won\u2019t be forever and the increased self-awareness and insights will stay with me for life. Whenever I weigh up my decisions, options, circumstances and my path forward, I always try to come back to this question: what legacy am I leaving my children? Right now my legacy is still showing my children the value, or lack thereof, of possession, of money, friendships, relationships, of having as strong work ethic and being compassionate and generous with everything that we have and who we are. I want them to know that sometimes, sacrifices are necessary so that others can reach their potential, and that while things might be tough right now, it won\u2019t always be like this. I want them to be able to ask for help in life when they need it and to know that there isn\u2019t anything wrong with doing so. I want them to live through the negative stigmas that they will inevitably encounter in their lives. I hope one day they will look at these articles written by all of us Life on the breadline writers and be thankful for what they have in spite of what they don\u2019t have, and still be humble. I am sure they will feel embarrassed that I have shared our lives with complete strangers but I hope they will understand the reason I have done so. Hopefully they will see that behind all of the written word, the stories told, the stigmas faced and the personal struggles endured, that we are all human and everyone deserves to be heard, to have safe housing, food on the table and access to healthcare, whether they have a university degree and high-paying job, are studying and in receipt of a benefit while they try to improve their life or can no longer work for medical reasons. If my children can walk through life not judging people for what they have and how they came by it, but rather with an open mind, a caring heart and with compassion, then I feel that this particular journey, this project, will have been completely worthwhile. Likewise, if readers can also see the humans behind these articles, and be more understanding and accepting of peoples\u2019 stories, then I feel this project will have been a huge success. We, the writers, will have given voice to those who are reliant on Centrelink, regardless of the reasons. There is still a subtle simmering of my emotions as I near the end of this final piece in the project. I think back to my now plentiful vegetable garden. When I was penning my first piece for you all, I was struggling with the cost of my water bill, trying to balance out that cost with the benefits that I received from time in my garden and the promise of fresh, homegrown fruit and vegetables. I second-guessed myself when some suggested I should just give up the garden for a cheaper water bill. I am proud that I stuck with it, and we now enjoy fresh garden salads with the vegetables grown and healthy fruit. The mental health benefits are as plentiful as the vegetables and fruit grown, and I can get some much-needed downtime in tending to the plants. Watching my daughter grow emotionally and socially and gain life skills, becoming more independent, dedicated and disciplined in her pursuits as she inches a little further towards her dreams and goals, with her equine companion and therapist by her side, I am reassured that my hours spent working at the stables, caring for others\u2019 horses and teaching horse riding is worth it. I still work in return for the agistment of our horses, mine aged and retired and my daughter\u2019s young and full of potential, the benefits far outweighing the sacrifices I make. My little family is not exactly where I want us to be, and in fact we may never be, but we are further ahead of where we were. Maybe this time next year I will be off the Centrelink roundabout and will be in a better position to provide more for my children amd give back more to my community. If we aren\u2019t though, then I will continue forwards with the notion that there is always someone worse off. I hope the powers that be will take the time to read the articles within this project, really see the readers when they describe the struggles, and raise the rates of benefits that we try to survive on. I\u2019m not convinced that will happen. * Name has been changed",

Self-poisoning is the most common method of self-harm in Australia, accounting for 80% of cases, and suicide is the leading cause of death in those aged between 15 and 44. The study also examined trends in medicine dispensing through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) database. Lead author of the study, Dr Rose Cairns, said researchers found large increases in the prescribing of psychotropic medications in children. \u201cPsychotropic medications are used to treat symptoms of mental disorders such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiety medications and ADHD medications,\u201d Cairns said. \u201cWe found there is substantial overlap between the most dispensed psychotropics and medicines most commonly used in self-poisoning episodes, which could mean that young people are overdosing on psychotropic medicine prescribed for them.\u201d The executive director of the youth mental health research institute Orygen, Professor Patrick McGorry, said \u201cwe need to save lives and futures\u201d.

A bit of perspective and taking things step by step is required methinks\u201d \u2013 Brendan Mackinney.</p> <p>Regarding claims about taking people to football matches and them marrying them (Fivers passim), I took my long-term partner to see Arsenal v Aston Villa (neither of which are my teams) in 1993. The language on the home terrace was frankly Rabelaisian due to an away win. She has since refused my invitation to marry three times. Can I claim an infinite timescale between said match and yet-to-be-hitched? My daughter is still talking to me after taking her to see Oxford United before Christmas. My son is simply \u2018not interested\u2019\u201d \u2013 Ed McDowall.</p> <p>\u201cIn 2001, I took my Dutch girlfriend to see Ireland beat the Dutch 1-0 and knock them out of the 2002 World Cup Qualifiers. She quickly got over the disappointment by us attending U2 at Slane the same day, meeting Bono and the Edge afterwards and then much later a drunken Irish football team in Lillie\u2019s Bordello nightclub. We did get married, but as both a Republic of Ireland and Coventry City supporter, I have repeatedly told her that that magic is unlikely to be recreated in the near future.

Prices for the return leg, in case you\u2019re planning to go, start at \u20ac75. Goals, please! Or failing that, some sort of game-cleansing reckoning. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Scott Murray from 8pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Atl\u00e9tico 0-0 Juventus, while Paul Doyle will be on hand for Schalke 0-1 Manchester City. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI would like to thank you once again for your help in the preparation and delivery of the World Cup. To demonstrate our gratitude for this joint work, I signed a decree awarding you the Order of Friendship of the Russian Federation\u201d \u2013 Vladimir Putin thanks chief Fifa suit Gianni Infantino. Just think what he could get from the Qataris! FIVER LETTERS \u201cDear Ilkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan, rather than winning Big [Cup] once and being at the same level as Real Madrid etc, your first target is to win it twice so you can be compared to Nottingham Forest. A bit of perspective and taking things step by step is required methinks\u201d \u2013 Brendan Mackinney. Regarding claims about taking people to football matches and them marrying them (Fivers passim), I took my long-term partner to see Arsenal v Aston Villa (neither of which are my teams) in 1993. The language on the home terrace was frankly Rabelaisian due to an away win. She has since refused my invitation to marry three times. Can I claim an infinite timescale between said match and yet-to-be-hitched? My daughter is still talking to me after taking her to see Oxford United before Christmas. My son is simply \u2018not interested\u2019\u201d \u2013 Ed McDowall. \u201cIn 2001, I took my Dutch girlfriend to see Ireland beat the Dutch 1-0 and knock them out of the 2002 World Cup Qualifiers. She quickly got over the disappointment by us attending U2 at Slane the same day, meeting Bono and the Edge afterwards and then much later a drunken Irish football team in Lillie\u2019s Bordello nightclub. We did get married, but as both a Republic of Ireland and Coventry City supporter, I have repeatedly told her that that magic is unlikely to be recreated in the near future. Still, we wait in hope\u201d \u2013 Gerry Rickard. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Brendan Mackinney, who wins The Game, by Stuart Roy Clarke. Condolences to Nick Livesey. Plenty more prizes to come. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Harry Kane is back, baby. Manchester City\u2019s world domination enterprise, City Football Group, has confirmed the gobbling up of another club, Chinese third-tier outfit Sichuan Jiuniu. \u201cChina is an extremely important football market,\u201d trilled City chief suit Ferran Soriano. Maurizio Sarri has had no contact with the Chelsea hierarchy this week and suggested his tactics are not the reason for the club\u2019s struggles. \u201cThe system is a false problem,\u201d he Sarri-ed. Nantes are set to take their transfer-fee dispute with Cardiff over Emiliano Sala to Fifa this week. Ashley Young is feeling all chipper about Manchester United facing Liverpool this Sunday. Karl Oyston\u2019s tribunal case against his equally revered dad, Owen, over non-payment of wages at Blackpool has been adjourned. Blackpool, now in receivership, huffed that it was not something they could comment on. Sami Khedira has undergone \u201celectrophysiological study and successful interventional therapy with ablation of an arrhythmogenic atrial focus\u201d, which is the long way of saying he\u2019s being treated for an irregular heartbeat. The German is expected to be fit again in a month. STILL WANT MORE? Defending is back, which is exciting news for Jonathan Wilson. Want some meat and potatoes? Get Jordan Henderson round, writes Barney Ronay. Remember when PFA suit Gordon Taylor promised a review into how the PFA is run? Marina Hyde does, and she\u2019s here to remind everybody else. Matija Nastasic asked Manuel Pellegrini to let him leave, luckily he allowed Nick Ames to stay long enough to tell him about it. Diego Simeone\u2019s plan to never let the opposition score was formed in Italy, as Greg Lea explains. Bury manager Ryan Lowe sat down for a hot chat about playing like Barcelona in League Two, $tevie Mbe and a J\u00fcrgen Klopp compliment.

      "bodyText": "Latin American artists haven\u2019t always been allowed into centre stage. Pushed to the sidelines of mainstream art history, artists like Zilia S\u00e1nchez were overlooked from the New York art scene in the 1960s, while Latinx artists have only recently gained attention from blockbuster museums. But Latin American art is finally taking over museums across the US, celebrating culture from south of the border. From fiberglass replicas of Aztec sculptures to photos of Mexico in the 1960s, a growing number of museums around the country are showing their support for contemporary artists from Latin America \u2013 especially with solo shows of Latin women artists. Here are some exhibitions featuring some of Latin America\u2019s finest talents to catch this season, from group to solo shows from Los Angeles to New York. Words/Matter at the Blanton Museum, Austin Until 26 May, Words/Matter at the Blanton Museum of Art, at the University of Texas in Austin, showcases over 150 Latin American artworks from the 1930s on. They all incorporate language in some form or another. There\u2019s concrete poetry by Brazilian writer Augusto de Campos and Spanish writer Julio Plaza alongside political prints created by Chilean, Latinx, and Chicanx artists. There will also be an artist book by Argentinian writer Leandro Katz from 1971, which explores the meanings behind the \u00d1 character. The museum has been collecting Latin American art since 1963 and just added 119 Spanish and Portuguese artworks to its collection. Beverly Adams, the Latin American art curator, said: \u201cThis exhibition gave us the opportunity to examine a strength of the Blanton collection \u2013 Latin American and Latinx visual artists exploring language in their work. \u201cThey do so by inventing new alphabets, engaging with prose and poetry, pioneering conceptual practices and producing art that is socially empowering. This exhibition highlights how artists use language to communicate personal, poetic and political messages, many of which speak to past and present cultural circumstances.\u201d Latin Reel, Shorts at the Museum of Arts and Design, New York On 28 February, the annual film series returns to the New York museum with new works by or about Latin Americans. With a special focus on South American directors, the program showcases narrative shorts that explore gender fluidity, youth culture and sexuality. The program includes Verde, a short directed by Colombian film-maker Victoria Rivera, a coming-of-age story about a young girl\u2019s life, and Lui, a short film directed by Denise Kelm about a gender-fluid circus teacher. \u201cIt\u2019s important to make visible the great films, that for multiple reasons, do not get screened at cultural institutions nor film events,\u201d said the program\u2019s curator, Jesus Hernandez. \u201cRepresentation does matter and if people and institutions in the position of power are not willing to find a balance and space for all of these diverse voices, then it\u2019s harder for everyone to see the complete picture.\u201d Mariana Castillo Deball at the New Museum, New York Until 14 April, Mexican artist Mariana Castillo Deball is showing sculptures and installations that fuse Mesoamerican iconography with a contemporary twist. Finding Oneself Outside features a survey of works that dig deep and dig out ancient artefacts, from stone sculptures to symbols found in 16th century notebooks, to use them as inspiration for sculptures. Each piece is a question of collective, personal and political history for the viewer to decode. The most stunning piece in the show is a pastel green fiberglass cast of the Coatlicue statue, one of the most famous Aztec sculptures from the 15th century \u2013 created by an unidentified Mexican artist \u2013 which is knocked on its side to show its hollow interior. Graciela Iturbide\u2019s Mexico at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Until 12 May, catch the pioneering Mexican photographer\u2019s showcase of photos through the eyes of one local in Graciela Iturbide\u2019s Mexico. From indigenous groups in Mexico, like the Juchit\u00e1n to the Seri and the Mixteca, 120 photographs walk us through intimate snapshots of Frida Kahlo\u2019s personal belongings found in her Casa Azul bathroom 50 years after her death (some of these items are also on view at Kahlo\u2019s retrospective on at the Brooklyn Museum).

There\u2019s also a close-up of Mexico\u2019s cultural heritage, featuring photos of everything from rare cacti to goat slaughtering rituals in Oaxaca. Beatriz Cortez at Craft Contemporary, Los Angeles Until 12 May, Craft Contemporary (formerly the Craft &amp; Folk Art Museum) in Los Angeles is showcasing El Salvador-born, Los Angeles-based artist Beatriz Cortez\u2019s latest works in Trinidad / Joy Station. The sculptures here offer a look at what life could be like with communal living.

      "bodyText": "Unai Emery has said it is up to Mesut \u00d6zil to get his Arsenal career back on track after revealing he has spoken to the midfielder about his regular absences from the first-team squad. \u00d6zil has featured in only 18 games in all competitions this season and made one start since Boxing Day. He has missed nine games through illness in just over a year and is unlikely to feature when his teammates try to overturn a one-goal deficit in the second leg of their Europa League tie against Bate Borisov at the Emirates. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has suggested last year\u2019s decision by Arsenal to offer \u00d6zil a long-term contract worth \u00a3350,000 a week may have left the German in \u201ca comfort zone\u201d. \u201cFirst, the key in his hands,\u201d said Emery, who has blamed \u00d6zil\u2019s absences on a mixture of minor injuries, poor performances and frequent bouts of unspecified illness. \u201cHe\u2019s working very well this week and I asked him in our conversation to be consistent, to be available for training. I said that when you can train with us consistently you can help us with your best performance in the games. \u201cI think this week was good for all the players because we are in a big, important moment for the season. I am looking at him doing the training like we want. I know he wants that but he needs consistency, to be available for training and the matches without injuries, without being sick. Like that, I think we can see the best Mesut.\u201d After Bate\u2019s surprise 1-0 win last week, their coach, Aleksei Baga, assured reporters he was \u201c100% sure\u201d his side \u201cwill achieve the big result next week\u201d. Arsenal fans, though confident, will be more cautious in their optimism. Their team should have enough to overcome a side preparing for only their second competitive fixture since mid-December. \u201cWe need to find a good balance between attacking and defending,\u201d said Laurent Koscielny. \u201cThey will play with a big block and counterattack, so we need to focus on our transitions. We can\u2019t give them free-kicks or corners. I don\u2019t know if we can score early in the game or wait until later, but we need to be more efficient in the boxes.\u201d On paper at least, there is a wide gulf in class between Emery\u2019s squad and their Belarusian opponents, but Arsenal had Petr Cech to thank for keeping the scoreline down at the Borisov Arena during last week\u2019s horror show. The deficit is far from insurmountable but failure to progress to the last 16 would be an embarrassment and leave Arsenal supporters frustrated. Quite how many will be present remains to be seen, as the 5.55pm kick-off on what, for many, is a work day could prevent thousands of season-ticket holders from attending. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d said Emery. \u201cWe want and we need supporters. The supporters want to watch our team put in the best performance possible. Even if there are a lot less supporters tomorrow in the stadium, I want them to be with us for 90 minutes, then the players can give the best performance possible.\u201d Emery acknowledged that last week\u2019s display was not anywhere near the best possible but stressed that the Europa League is increasingly difficult to win. \u201cEvery team wants to win this competition,\u201d he said. \u201cSmall teams have chances to cause a surprise. Bate have a lot of experienced players with Belarus and they have shown us they can be competitive. We need to win.\u201d First leg Bate 1 Arsenal 0 Possible second-leg teams Arsenal (4-3-3): Cech; Maitland-Niles, Mustafi, Koscielny, Kolasinac; Guendouzi, Xhaka, S\u00faarez; Mkhitaryan, Aubameyang, Iwobi. Bate Borisov (4-3-3): Scherbitskiy; Ryas, Volkov, Filipenko, Filipovic; Baha, Drahun, Hleb; Stasevich, Skavysh, Milic.",

She was elected to represent Totnes, Devon in the 2010 general election. She later became the Chair of the Liaison Committee and the Health Select Committee. Wollaston practised as a GP until her election into parliament.</p> \n  <p><strong>Heidi Allen</strong> was elected to represent South Cambridgeshire in the 2015 general election. She used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/video/2015/oct/20/heidi-allen-tax-credits-not-a-spreadsheet-exercise-these-are-real-people-video\">her maiden speech</a> to criticise the government\u2019s plan to cut tax credits. She was promptly elected onto the Work and Pensions Select Committee. In 2017 Allen failed to obtain a Conservative Party nomination for Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. Before entering parliament, Allen worked for RS Bike Paint Ltd, a company owned by her parents. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c6d4ee4e4b0793c8d0b29e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-20T13:04:57.850Z\">1.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a38a8d5039b67a1c8613d41c2db6e4f24b01c14\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a38a8d5039b67a1c8613d41c2db6e4f24b01c14/264_0_1634_980/1000.png\" alt=\"Mel Stride, Financial Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster General, responds to an urgent question.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mel Stride, Financial Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster General, responds to an urgent question.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mel Stride, Financial Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster General/Parliament TV</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Ian Blackford has asked an urgent question to the prime minister to set out the analysis the government has done on the economic impact of its proposed EU withdrawal deal.

A party of economic competence, representing the best of British business, delivering good jobs, opportunity and prosperity for all, funding world class public services and tackling inequalities. We had hoped you would also continue to modernise our party so that it could reach out and broaden its appeal to younger voters and to embrace and reflect the diversity of the communities we seek to represent. </p> \n   <p>Sadly, the Conservative party has increasingly abandoned these principles and values with a shift to the right of British politics. We no longer feel we can remain in the party of a government whose policies and priorities are so firmly in the grip of the ERG and DUP. </p> \n   <p>Brexit has re-defined the Conservative party - undoing all the efforts to modernise it. There has been a dismal failure to stand up to the hard line ERG which operates openly as a party within a party, with its own leader, whip and policy.</p> \n   <p>This shift to the right has been exacerbated by blatant entryism. Not only has this been tolerated, it has been actively welcomed in some quarters. A purple momentum is subsuming the Conservative party, much as the hard left has been allowed to consume and terminally undermine the Labour party. </p> \n   <p>We have tried consistently and for some time to keep the party close to the centre ground of British politics. You assured us when you first sought the leadership that this was your intention. We haven\u2019t changed, the Conservative party has and it no longer reflects the values and beliefs we share with millions of people throughout the United Kingdom. </p> \n   <p>The final straw for us has been this government\u2019s disastrous handling of Brexit. </p> \n   <p>Following the EU referendum of 2016, no genuine effort was made to build a cross party, let alone a national consensus to deliver Brexit. Instead of seeking to heal the divisions or to tackle the underlying causes of Brexit, the priority was to draw up \u201cred lines\u201d. The 48% were not only sidelined, they were alienated. </p> \n   <p>We find it unconscionable that a party once trusted on the economy, more than any other, is now recklessly marching the country to the cliff edge of no deal. No responsible government should knowingly and deliberately inflict the dire consequences of such a destructive exit on individuals, communities and businesses and put at risk the prospect of ending austerity. </p> \n   <p>We also reject the false binary choice that you have presented to Parliament between a bad deal and no deal. Running down the clock to 29 March amounts to a policy of no deal and we are not prepared to wait until our toes are at the edge of the cliff. </p> \n   <p>We can no longer act as bystanders. </p> \n   <p>We intend to sit as independents alongside the Independent Group of MPs in the centre ground of British politics. There will be times when we will support the government, for example, on measures to strengthen our economy, security and improve our public services. But we now feel honour bound to put our constituents\u2019 and country\u2019s interests first. </p> \n   <p>We would like to thank all those who have supported us and worked alongside us within our constituencies over many years. We genuinely wish our many friends and colleagues within the party well, indeed we know many of them share our concerns. </p> \n   <p>We will continue to work constructively, locally and nationally, on behalf of our constituents. </p> \n   <p>However, the country deserves better. We believe there is a failure of politics in general, not just in the Conservative party but in both main parties as they move to the fringes, leaving millions of people with no representation. Our politics needs urgent and radical reform and we are determined to play our part. </p> \n   <p>Yours sincerely, </p> \n   <p>Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-20T12:04:43.288Z\">at 12.04pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c6d3aabe4b01d34823c6b8e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-20T11:34:51.256Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Reaction is coming in to the news of the three Tory MP resignations.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EricPickles/status/1098179181102448640\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Expected, sad, and ultimately a big mistake for the individuals <a href=\"https://t.co/QKYS1ICrUg\">https://t.co/QKYS1ICrUg</a></p>\u2014 Eric Pickles (@EricPickles) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EricPickles/status/1098179181102448640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 20, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NickyMorgan01/status/1098178932904476672\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Very sorry to read this from my principled and fearless friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Anna_Soubry?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Anna_Soubry</a> - any political party should be a broad church and we should regret losing three such talented women from the Conservative Party <a href=\"https://t.co/ird2MeCYIT\">https://t.co/ird2MeCYIT</a></p>\u2014 Nicky Morgan MP (@NickyMorgan01) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickyMorgan01/status/1098178932904476672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 20, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/joswinson/status/1098180706482704385\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"a purple momentum is now subsuming the Conservative party... marching the country to the cliff edge of no deal\"<br><br>Kudos to the brave MPs who have left the broken Conservative and Labour parties.

      "bodyText": "Interesting from the Guardian\u2019s political editor. Is the Labour party preparing for more resignations? Here\u2019s the first photoshoot of the Independent Group all together. The three former Tory MPs who quit this morning in protest at the Conservative party\u2019s move to the right have given a press conference. They said they had become dismayed by Theresa May\u2019s pandering to the far right of her own party and complained that she was pushing the country towards a hard Brexit. They said the Tories were as affected by entryism as Labour and that many MPs were afraid of being deselected by their local parties. Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen said there were many MPs who felt the same as them. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn clashed on Brexit in a PMQs, where there was no mention of the 11 MPs who have quit their parties. The new Independent Group of MPs sat in their new positions on the opposition benches and could be seen taking selfies ahead of the debate. Former Labour MP Joan Ryan became the latest to leave the party in protest at its handling of antisemitism and Brexit last night. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Today programme this morning, she said the party\u2019s problems with antisemitism only began when Corbyn became leader. We never had this problem in the party before he was the leader. It comes with him, it is part of his politics, I am afraid. Theresa May is travelling to Brussels this afternoon to meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, with plans to secure legal assurances that the Irish backstop will not permanently bind the UK into a customs union. Speaking in Berlin this morning, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said the government could now see a way of getting its deal through parliament by the 29 March deadline. He said a compromise needed to be reached that would allow the attorney general to change his legal advice to MPs. I think what\u2019s changed in the last four weeks is that we\u2019ve now seen a way that we can get a parliamentary majority for the withdrawal agreement \u2013 that seemed much more difficult before \u2013 and that is essentially to take the deal that we have on the table in its entirety, but make a simple but important change to the Northern Ireland backstop, but one that guarantees the future of the Belfast, Good Friday peace agreement. Linda Fabiani, a former Scottish National party minister, has been appointed to chair the special Holyrood inquiry into the Scottish government\u2019s botched handling of its investigation into sexual harassment complaints against Alex Salmond. At its inaugural meeting on Wednesday Labour and Tory members lodged formal objections to an SNP MSP chairing the committee, set up to investigate the actions of civil servants, the first minister Nicola Sturgeon and her special advisers before it emerged the inquiry was legally flawed. Salmond denies the allegations and mounted legal action against the government, which admitted in court last month the senior civil servant who led the internal inquiry into allegations against by two women had had prior contact with both complainants. The Scottish government agreed that gave the inquiry the appearance of bias. Sturgeon has since admitted she discussed the case five times with Salmond while her chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, was instrumental in brokering the first meeting between Sturgeon and Salmond. Now a deputy presiding officer at Holyrood, Fabiani is one of three former SNP ministers on the committee was served under Salmond when he was first minister, as European affairs and culture minister from 2007 until 2009. Under Holyrood rules, it is the SNP\u2019s turn to chair a new committee but the party has the right to step aside. Jackie Baillie, a Scottish Labour MSP on the committee, and Donald Cameron, for the Tories, said they did not doubt Fabiani\u2019s probity but warned it could raise questions about the committee\u2019s independence and transparency. The Liberal Democrats and Greens supported the SNP chairing the committee, which has now suspended its investigations until Salmond\u2019s trial on 14 charges including attempted rape and sexual assault has finished. He denies all the charges. Looks like Lineker is a fan ... Wollaston says there is a very aggressive and well-funded social media campaign that has been waged against them. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear to me that our associations are changing. We have people who are very clearly Ukip and they are turning the Conservative party to Blukip,\u201d she says. Soubry says lots of Tory MPs are frightened of being deselected. They are not frightened of their electorate, but people in their associations, she says. Soubry says she stands by the Tory austerity policy after 2010 and that it was the right thing to do for the country. Wollaston says it is extraordinary that \u201cjust at the point when we can start to reverse austerity, we are knowingly and deliberately about to send ourselves back into an economic downturn\u201d. Asked why they voted with the government on a no-confidence motion just a few weeks ago, Soubry says: \u201cThe last thing this country wants or needs is a general election.\u201d Allen and Soubry say they would not rejoin the Conservative party. Heidi Allen says she had one text from a cabinet minister last night trying to persuade her not to leave, but Wollaston and Soubry say they\u2019ve had nothing. Heidi Allen says the three MPs had run out of ammunition to persuade May to change her path on Brexit. \u201cThis is designed to be a wake-up call,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is a taste of more to come.\u201d Sarah Wollaston says that the new Independent Group is bigger than the DUP and the ERG \u2013 instead of constantly reaching out to those groups, Theresa May should reach out to them. Heidi Allen says there are lots of MPs who agree with them. She says they had no idea that the seven Labour MPs were planning their announcement, but decided to \u201cpick up the baton\u201d today. Anna Soubry says that they are appealing for everybody \u2013 even people who voted for Brexit \u2013 to join them. Moves to modernise the Tory party under Cameron have all been thrown away, she says, and it is now in the grip of the ERG. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving the Conservative party. It has left me,\u201d she says. Soubry calls on other MPs to join them and says there are millions of people who support their values and who are tired of tribal politics. Soubry says you don\u2019t join a political party to fight it. \u201cThe battle is over and the other side has won,\u201d she says. \u201cThe rightwing, the hardline anti-EU awkward squad are running the Conservative party from top to toe.\u201d She says that many of her friends in the party know \u201cin their heads and in their hearts that it\u2019s over\u201d. \u201cBrexit now defines the Conservative party.\u201d She says her colleagues are being hounded in their constituency parties by infiltrators, even though they are supporting the prime minister\u2019s deal. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that Conservatives observe it and condemn it in the Labour party, but it is happening in their own party.\u201d Anna Soubry says the Conservative party has been very good to her. She says she had rejoined the party in 2002 as a single mother of two when it had started to modernise. \u201cIt is with a heavy heart that I have today resigned my membership of the Conservative party,\u201d she says. Sarah Wollaston is up next. She says she wants to answer the questions of why now and what next. She says she wouldn\u2019t have joined the Conservative party if it had looked then as it does now. \u201cThis is about more than Brexit. I joined the party after spending 24 years in the NHS as a frontline doctor wanting to make a difference,\u201d she says. She joined a tolerant, modern open-hearted Conservative party, which has since disappeared, says Wollaston. She says the Conservatives were once the party most trusted on the economy but that they were now driving the country up to the cliff edge with their approach to Brexit. She says she feels excited in a way she hasn\u2019t felt since she was elected, and a sense of liberation. \u201cThe United Kingdom deserves better,\u201d she says. \u201cYes we are putting our heads above the parapet and we might fail, but isn\u2019t the prize worth fighting for?\u201d Heidi Allen has taken to the stage. She says that he we heard yesterday about \u201cthe magnificent seven\u201d, then yesterday evening about the \u201clone ranger\u201d. Now we are meeting the \u201cthree amigos\u201d. \u201cI am tired of feeling numb,\u201d she says. \u201cSo today \u2013 alongside my wonderful colleagues \u2013 I have resigned from the Conservative party.\u201d She says she found herself fighting for a compassionate welfare system. \u201cThose that rely on the [safety] net are people and not numbers.\u201d \u201cI can no longer represent a party that can\u2019t open its eyes to suffering in our society. Suffering that has deepened, when it was in our power to fix it.\u201d The three MPs who this morning announced they had resigned from the Conservative party are now giving a press conference in Westminster. (You can watch the live stream at the top of this blog.) Ahead of the press conference by the Independent Group, here are some potted bios of who exactly is resigning from the Tory party. Anna Soubry was elected as MP for Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire following the 2010 general election. She was elected onto the Justice Select committee later that summer. Soubry worked as a journalist until the mid-1990s, presenting regional and networked television programmes. She is a prominent supporter of the People\u2019s Vote campaign. Sarah Wollaston had been a member of the Conservative Party since 2006. She was elected to represent Totnes, Devon in the 2010 general election. She later became the Chair of the Liaison Committee and the Health Select Committee. Wollaston practised as a GP until her election into parliament. Heidi Allen was elected to represent South Cambridgeshire in the 2015 general election. She used her maiden speech to criticise the government\u2019s plan to cut tax credits. She was promptly elected onto the Work and Pensions Select Committee. In 2017 Allen failed to obtain a Conservative Party nomination for Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. Before entering parliament, Allen worked for RS Bike Paint Ltd, a company owned by her parents. Ian Blackford has asked an urgent question to the prime minister to set out the analysis the government has done on the economic impact of its proposed EU withdrawal deal. Mel Stride, financial secretary to the Treasury and paymaster general, says the government published its analysis on the economic impact of Brexit at the end of November. He says a no-deal Brexit would be bad for the economy. Blackford says it is clear from Stride\u2019s answer that there has been no specific analysis of the withdrawal agreement. He says that economists are clear that the PM\u2019s proposed deal would be disastrous for the economy. Angela Eagle asks the PM what her definition of \u201csmooth and orderly Brexit\u201d is. As I say to every member of this house, there will come a further point in this chamber when every member will have a decision to take as to whether we want to ensure that we deliver on the result of the referendum \u2013 and most members of this house stood on a manifesto to do that \u2013 and to do that by leaving the EU with a deal ... I know where I stand and I hope the honourable lady agrees. And that\u2019s it from PMQs. No mention of the 11 MPs who have left their parties to be independents. We\u2019ll have to wait until the 1.15pm press conference for more on that. So far the only defection mentioned by May has been that of Brighton Labour councillor Anne Meadows, who has defected to the Tories saying she\u2019s suffered months of abuse and antisemitism. That\u2019s the harsh reality that decent moderate Labour councillors are having to face every day, due to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s failure to stand up to bullying and racism in his party. We will welcome her with open arms into the Conservative party. I\u2019m sure she will be an excellent Conservative councillor. It looks like we might get through a whole PMQs without anybody mentioning the elephant in the room \u2013 the elephant being the 11 MPs who have defected from their respective parties and are sitting together on the opposition benches. Leo Docherty asks the PM to join him in thanking the home secretary for showing that people who join terrorists abroad do not deserve citizenship. Theresa May says she dealt with cases of deprivation of citizenship when she was home secretary and that they come with a very clear set of criteria. She says it is important for \u201cthis government and this country to take action against those who are involved in terrorism\u201d. Here\u2019s a pretty startling image, showing former MPs Soubry, Allen and Wollaston sitting behind Corbyn. And another here: Corbyn asks May when she is going to stop \u201cputting the interests of the Conservative party ahead of the country\u2019s interests\u201d. May responds with the same charge back at Corbyn \u2013 \u201cAt every stage he has acted to frustrate a deal and acted to make no-deal more likely.\u201d On Honda, May says the company has made it clear the company\u2019s decision was not about Brexit. She says that seeing as Corbyn wants to talk about jobs, why doesn\u2019t he welcome today\u2019s high employment figures. Corbyn asks why she won\u2019t listen to industry bodies who want a customs union. \u201cWhen investment is cut today, jobs are cut tomorrow,\u201d he says. May says they need to find a solution that is going to deliver for the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and address the concerns of the commons so the country can leave on the 29 March with a deal. She asks Corbyn to \u201ctell us what his policy is \u2013 to back the deal or to stay in the European Union?\u201d He says he wrote her a letter setting out the party\u2019s position. Corbyn asks May about Brexit negotiations. She says: \u201cWhat matters in all of this is legally binding changes that address the concerns that have been raised in this house.\u201d Corbyn says it \u201csounds like it might be a bit confusing\u201d for the EU to understand what she is \u201cturning up with\u201d. Asked about antisemitism, Theresa May says: \u201cI never thought I would see the day when Jewish people in this country would be worried about their safety in their country,\u201d and when a \u201conce-proud Labour party\u201d is accused of anti-semitism. \u201cIt is racism and we should act against it,\u201d she adds. Jeremy Corbyn says: \u201cAntisemitism has no place whatsoever is any of our political parties.\u201d He has to pause because of MPs jeering. \u201cMy own political party takes the strongest action to deal with antisemitism whenever it rears its head.\u201d PMQs has kicked off. Theresa May is paying tribute to Labour MP Paul Flynn, who died this weekend. She reminds the house of his excellent quote when he was sent to the backbenches by Corbyn. MPs are gearing up for what will be a very interesting PMQs. The Independent Group MPs have taken their new seats. Here is that resignation letter in full from Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen: Dear Prime Minster It is with regret that we are writing to resign the Conservative whip and our membership of the party. We voted for you as leader and prime minister because we believed you were committed to a moderate, open-hearted Conservative party in the one nation tradition. A party of economic competence, representing the best of British business, delivering good jobs, opportunity and prosperity for all, funding world class public services and tackling inequalities. We had hoped you would also continue to modernise our party so that it could reach out and broaden its appeal to younger voters and to embrace and reflect the diversity of the communities we seek to represent. Sadly, the Conservative party has increasingly abandoned these principles and values with a shift to the right of British politics. We no longer feel we can remain in the party of a government whose policies and priorities are so firmly in the grip of the ERG and DUP. Brexit has re-defined the Conservative party - undoing all the efforts to modernise it. There has been a dismal failure to stand up to the hard line ERG which operates openly as a party within a party, with its own leader, whip and policy. This shift to the right has been exacerbated by blatant entryism. Not only has this been tolerated, it has been actively welcomed in some quarters. A purple momentum is subsuming the Conservative party, much as the hard left has been allowed to consume and terminally undermine the Labour party. We have tried consistently and for some time to keep the party close to the centre ground of British politics. You assured us when you first sought the leadership that this was your intention. We haven\u2019t changed, the Conservative party has and it no longer reflects the values and beliefs we share with millions of people throughout the United Kingdom. The final straw for us has been this government\u2019s disastrous handling of Brexit. Following the EU referendum of 2016, no genuine effort was made to build a cross party, let alone a national consensus to deliver Brexit. Instead of seeking to heal the divisions or to tackle the underlying causes of Brexit, the priority was to draw up \u201cred lines\u201d. The 48% were not only sidelined, they were alienated. We find it unconscionable that a party once trusted on the economy, more than any other, is now recklessly marching the country to the cliff edge of no deal. No responsible government should knowingly and deliberately inflict the dire consequences of such a destructive exit on individuals, communities and businesses and put at risk the prospect of ending austerity. We also reject the false binary choice that you have presented to Parliament between a bad deal and no deal. Running down the clock to 29 March amounts to a policy of no deal and we are not prepared to wait until our toes are at the edge of the cliff. We can no longer act as bystanders. We intend to sit as independents alongside the Independent Group of MPs in the centre ground of British politics. There will be times when we will support the government, for example, on measures to strengthen our economy, security and improve our public services. But we now feel honour bound to put our constituents\u2019 and country\u2019s interests first. We would like to thank all those who have supported us and worked alongside us within our constituencies over many years. We genuinely wish our many friends and colleagues within the party well, indeed we know many of them share our concerns. We will continue to work constructively, locally and nationally, on behalf of our constituents. However, the country deserves better. We believe there is a failure of politics in general, not just in the Conservative party but in both main parties as they move to the fringes, leaving millions of people with no representation. Our politics needs urgent and radical reform and we are determined to play our part. Yours sincerely, Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston Reaction is coming in to the news of the three Tory MP resignations. More defections away from Westminster ... Theresa May has issued a statement in response to the news that three of her MPs have left the Labour party and will join the Independent Group of eight former Labour MPs in parliament. I am saddened by this decision \u2013 these are people who have given dedicated service to our party over many years, and I thank them for it. Of course, the UK\u2019s membership of the EU has been a source of disagreement both in our party and our country for a long time. Ending that membership after four decades was never going to be easy. But by delivering on our manifesto commitment and implementing the decision of the British people we are doing the right thing for our country. And in doing so, we can move forward together towards a brighter future. I am determined that under my leadership the Conservative party will always offer the decent, moderate and patriotic politics that the people of this country deserve. Anna Soubry has tweeted a letter of resignation from the three MPs to the prime minister. In it they say they voted for Theresa May because they thought she was \u201ccommitted to a moderate, open-hearted Conservative party in the one nation tradition\u201d. They say the Conservative party has shifted to the right. This shift to the right has been exacerbated by blatant entryism. Not only has this been tolerated, it has been actively welcomed in some quarters. A purple momentum is subsuming the Conservative party, as much as the hard left has been allowed to consume and terminally undermine the Labour party. It has been confirmed that three Conservative MPs \u2013 Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen \u2013 have left the party and will join the Independent Group of eight in parliament. They will be holding a press conference at 1.15pm. We no longer feel we can remain in the party of a government whose policies and priorities are so firmly in the grip of the ERG and DUP. Brexit has re-defined the Conservative party \u2013 undoing all the efforts to modernise it. There has been a dismal failure to stand up to the hardline ERG, which operates openly as a party within a party, with its own leader, whip and policy. Momentum is celebrating after its candidate this morning won the selection battle to represent Labour in the elections to become the first North of Tyne mayor. Socialist grassroots activist Jamie Driscoll beat \u201cheir of Blair\u201d Nick Forbes, who has been the leader of Newcastle city council since 2011. Driscoll, a former nurse who went on to set up his own software development firm, who was first elected to Newcastle council last May. He won 2,514 votes to Forbes\u2019s 1,930 in a poll of local Labour members. Described by Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, as \u201ca 100 per cent genuine socialist\u201d, Driscoll\u2019s website promises \u201cradical regional renewal\u201d. His policies include setting up a regional bank and a renewable energy cooperative owned by workers and customers. The north-east of England has long been a Labour stronghold and so the party\u2019s candidate has a good chance of becoming the mayor, who will be a figurehead for the local authority areas of Newcastle city, North Tyneside borough and Northumberland county. The mayoral election will take place on 2 May. The winner will preside over an extra \u00a3600m of central government funding being devolved to the area, together with powers over the economy, education, skills and transport. Over in Greece, Britain\u2019s ambassador, Kate Smith, has welcomed the news that the rights of an estimated 45,000 UK citizens living in the country will be fully protected in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Describing British citizens living in Greece as \u201can important bridge of friendship between our two countries\u201d, the Greek foreign minister, Georgios Katrougalos, pledged that whatever happened after 29 March, UK nationals would be able to remain in the country without risk. \u201cThere is a substantial Greek community in the UK and a sizeable UK community in Greece and we wish for both of them to continue to enjoy fully the benefits and privileges they had before withdrawal,\u201d Katrougalos wrote in a letter to his British counterpart, Jeremy Hunt, published by the UK government this morning. With ratification of the withdrawal agreement far from a done deal, Katrougalos said Athens was now obliged \u201cto prepare for the eventuality of a no-deal scenario\u201d. In this scenario too, citizens\u2019 rights is a top priority and our aim is to ensure that both Greek and UK citizens who chose to live, study and work in each others\u2019 countries will continue to do so without obstacles and will fully enjoy similar, if not identical, rights as before withdrawal \u2026 Let me assure you, in this respect, that British citizens already living in Greece are welcome, valued and [are] an important bridge of friendship between our two countries. Their rights will be fully recognised and guaranteed, in line with the reciprocity offered by the UK to EU citizens. The Greek state was working expeditiously, he insisted, on fast-tracking legislation that will \u201cgive British citizens and their family members already living in Greece before the withdrawal date, the opportunity to remain here and continue to live, study and work, as well as enjoy social security and healthcare benefits\u201d. Around 30,000 Greeks \u2013 not least the country\u2019s well-heeled shipping community \u2013 are thought to live in the UK. Kate Smith tweeted: \u201cDelighted that the Greek government has confirmed that in the event of no deal the rights of UK nationals already living in Greece will be fully recognised and guaranteed, in line with the reciprocity offered by the UK to EU citizens.\u201d Ruth Smeeth, Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent North, who has herself reported antisemitic abuse, has ruled out following her friend Luciana Berger in leaving the Labour party. Writing for Jewish News, she said she came from a family of proud jewish trade unionists. I am devastated that my friend, Luciana Berger, has been hounded out of our party for nothing more than being a Jewish woman; for standing up against antisemitism within the Labour party, and for being brave enough to speak out. But I will not walk away and allow my once great party \u2013 the party of Attlee, of Barbara Castle, of Manny Shinwell or Ian Mikardo and allow it to become a natural home for antisemites. I refuse to abandon the thousands of decent and hard-working members of the Labour party who campaign each and every week for a better country or give up on the 120-year history of a movement which has been the greatest force for social change in our country. We cannot let the racists win and after decades of loudly campaigning against racism wherever I found it, I refuse to be silenced when it is in my own party. So to my Labour family and my Jewish family, I want to say that I have never walked away from a fight and I have no intention of doing so now. Jeremy Hunt has just finished speaking at the Konrad-Adenauer Foundation in Berlin. Asked how likely it was that EU withdrawal would be delayed past 29 March, Hunt said: This is a very important deadline. It is a legally binding deadline. I think what\u2019s changed in the last four weeks is that we\u2019ve now seen a way that we can get a parliamentary majority for the withdrawal agreement \u2013 that seemed much more difficult before \u2013 and that is essentially to take the deal that we have on the table in its entirety, but make a simple but important change to the Northern Ireland backstop, but one that guarantees the future of the Belfast, Good Friday peace agreement. If we can make that change we are confident that we can get this deal through and the critical thing is that the British attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, needs to be able to change his advice to parliament that currently says that it is possible, if not likely, that Britain could be under the current backstop arrangements, trapped in the customs union, forever, against its will. That is the issue that parliamentarians have difficulty with, so this is really the only way through the current situation and that is why 29 March is concentrating everybody\u2019s minds. Nobody wants a no-deal outcome and I think we now have to do what Europeans do very well, which is to come together around a table and find a compromise that allows Geoffrey Cox to change his advice and then I think we can meet that 29 March deadline. Andy Wigmore, a prominent Nigel Farage associate, has tweeted his congratulations to Derek Hatton for being readmitted to the Labour party, 34 years after being expelled for his membership of the Militant faction. Here is some reaction from people in Liverpool, where he was deputy leader of the council. Newsnight\u2019s Nick Watt again, saying that Tory defections are set for 11am. Earlier this morning, former Conservative cabinet minister Ken Clarke told the Today programme that he believed some Tory MPs were considering joining the new Independent Group. Certainly some Members of Parliament are getting very fed up. There are some, I think - not including me - who probably are contemplating leaving if the party moves too far to the right and no longer represents what they regard as the mainstream Conservative views they have held for all the previous years. I hope that doesn\u2019t happen. I hope it doesn\u2019t come to that. Jeremy Hunt will be giving a speech in Berlin shortly. Speaking this morning, he said achieving a Brexit deal would require statesmanship on all sides. The message is really to everyone that it is possible to find a way through this. Of course it\u2019s challenging, of course there are difficulties. But there is a solution. We can get this deal through Parliament if we can have a deal where the Attorney General can change his advice on the backstop, that\u2019s going to be key to unlocking it. With vision and statesmanship on all sides, this can be done and I\u2019m hopeful it will be. In light of Labour\u2019s announcement that they are consulting on allowing constituents to trigger a by-election if their MP leaves the political party they were elected in, people on Twitter have dragged up this 2010 tweet from Corbyn. Joan Ryan has been speaking on the BBC\u2019s Today programme. She said the party\u2019s problems with anti-semitism only began when Corbyn became leader. We never had this problem in the party before he was the leader. It comes with him, it is part of his politics I am afraid. Labour should be the bulwark against that - against the hard right and their views. Instead of that, inside Labour it is perpetuating anti-Semitism ... He (Corbyn) has introduced or allowed to happen in our party this scourge of anti-Semitism. It has completely infected the party and at every opportunity to deal with it he has not done so. We have had a whitewash report, we have had unprecedented actions of Jewish people feeling they have to demonstrate against the Labour Party in Parliament Square. We have had endless calls on him to deal with the most virulent, vile anti-Semitism - bullying, abuse and aggression - and he has turned away from doing that. Ryan said Corbyn was aiding and abetting a hard Brexit and that many Labour MPs were unhappy with the party\u2019s leadership. \u201cI hope that all like-minded MPs from whatever party will want to join this group. It is early days. It is about trying to change the political weather,\u201d she said. Labour is consulting on extending the Recall of MPs Act 2015 to enable constituents to recall MPs if they leave their political party. At present, constituents can only do this if their MP is jailed or suspended from parliament for 21 days for a serious breach of rules. Jon Trickett, Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet office minister, said: \u201cPower comes from the people but for too long the overwhelming majority have been shut out. That\u2019s why trust in politics and in elites is rightly falling. \u201cCommunities should not have to wait for up to five years to act if they feel their MP is not properly representing their interests, especially with restrictions of the Fixed Term Parliament Act. \u201cThis proposed reform has the dramatic potential to empower citizens and will be one of the any measures the Labour party is planning to consult on and announce that will change the way politics in this country is done.\u201d Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt reports that the Conservative MPs rumoured to be planning a departure to the Independent Group could do it shortly before PMQs. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s politics live blog. Joan Ryan, the MP for Enfield North, has become the eighth parliamentarian to leave the Labour party and join the breakaway Independent Group, claiming Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party has become \u201cinfected with the scourge of anti-Jewish racism\u201d. Ryan said she had been a member for four decades \u2013 but could no longer remain as a Labour MP. There are rumours that a string of centrist Tories could be poised to follow her in joining the Independent Group, which was formed on Monday by seven former Labour MPs, including Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie. Possible candidates are thought to be ardent anti-Brexit campaigners Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston, as well as Heidi Allen. In Brexit news \u2013 Theresa May is travelling to Brussels to meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, with plans to secure legal assurances that the Irish backstop will not permanently bind the UK into a customs union. Downing Street hopes this will be enough to convince Eurosceptics to back her Brexit deal. The prime minister was forced to admit to Conservative MPs who met her on Tuesday night that the Irish backstop could not be replaced by the \u201cMalthouse compromise\u201d \u2013 proposals for a free trade agreement with as-yet-unknown technology to avoid customs checks on the Irish border. However, she stressed that this solution would still be examined in future to help solve the issue of customs arrangements at the Irish border. Here\u2019s a good summary of what the Malthouse compromise was \u2013 We can expect more reaction today to the news that the home secretary has ordered Shamima Begum, the teenager who travelled from east London to Syria to join Islamic State in 2015, to be deprived of her British citizenship. Sajid Javid wrote to her family informing them he had made the order, believing the fact her parents are of Bangladeshi heritage means she can apply for citizenship of that country \u2013 though Begum says she has never visited it. People are questioning the legality of this move as it is illegal, under international law, to make a person stateless. Begum\u2019s family lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, said they were \u201cconsidering all legal avenues to challenge the decision\u201d, that had left them \u201cvery disappointed\u201d. Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt will make a speech at a meeting with German counterpart at around 9am, which will be streamed here. We\u2019ll have PMQs at midday as usual and there will be a short debate in parliament about anti-semitism. We\u2019ll bring you all of the other politics news and developments throughout the day.",

      "bodyText": "The UK food industry has begged the government to avoid a no-deal Brexit, warning it could lead to food shortages and price rises. Nearly a third of the food Britons eat comes from the EU. In March, when the UK is set to exit the trading bloc, the proportion is far higher because most British crops are not yet ready to harvest. According to the British Retail Consortium, during the month of March 90% of the lettuces eaten in the UK, 80% of the tomatoes and 70% of soft fruit is sourced from the EU. The fear is that long delays at ports, the introduction of high import and export tariffs and a lack of migrant workers to pick and process food could not just be highly disruptive, but sound the death knell for some British farmers, producers and retailers. Even the pro-Brexit environment secretary, Michael Gove, has admitted delays were likely in Calais \u2013 the port that handles most food heading from the EU to the UK \u2013 due to mandatory EU checks on food exports from the UK on the French side of the channel. That, he said, would have a knock-on effect on trucks and the turnaround of ferries heading back to the UK. On Tuesday he told the National Farmers\u2019 Union annual conference in Birmingham that reports suggesting Britain would operate a zero-tariff regime in order to secure frictionless trade in a no-deal scenario were \u201cnot accurate\u201d. He said the tariff regime Britain would like to apply in the event of no deal \u2013 most probably on meat, and especially lamb \u2013 would be revealed in the \u201cnext few days\u201d. Gove promised British food standards would not be lowered \u201cin pursuit of trade deals\u201d, but UK producers fear a wave of lower standard imports \u2013 particularly from the US \u2013 could undercut them and reduce quality for shoppers. Retailers usually have only a few days\u2019 food supplies in their distribution centres if they are not kept topped up. They have been stockpiling packet, tinned and frozen foods and are examining ways to increase the shelf life of the most perishable goods, taking on more chilled storage capacity and using varieties of perishables that last longer. Three-quarters of warehouse owners say their space is now full to capacity, according to a January survey by the UK Warehousing Association, whose 750 member operate 9.3m sq metres (100m sq ft) of space across the country. It is understood that frozen and chilled food warehouses, storing everything from garden peas to half-cooked supermarket bread and cold-store potatoes, are now fully booked until beyond April. But many company chiefs privately admit their main policy is to cross their fingers and hope that the UK signs a deal with the EU as soon as possible. Retailers Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer Both major retailers have said they are working with suppliers to stockpile packet and tinned foods. Tesco boss, Dave Lewis, said the retailer had been working with all its suppliers to build a plan for each category. But he warned that fresh foods would be a \u201cpinch point\u201d if there was no deal because they could not be stockpiled. With frozen and chilled warehouse storage space now fully booked, Tesco has taken an extra year\u2019s lease on several hundred refrigerated containers, located in store car parks, which it usually has only at Christmas. Morrisons The Bradford-based supermarket chain has applied and been accepted for authorised economic operator (AEO) status which enables simplified customs procedures and the possibility of fast-tracked shipments for importers. Other retailers may have applied for this status, but have not confirmed the move and it is currently reported to be taking up to 12 months to obtain AEO approval from HMRC. Majestic Wine The wine merchants has stored 1m extra bottles of wine from France, Spain and Italy in case there are import problems or increases in duty post-Brexit. Pets at Home The listed pet store has stockpiled \u00a38m of extra supplies, including dog and cat food. Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda Both supermarkets signed a British Retail Consortium-backed letter calling on the government to avoid a no-deal Brexit. The letter said these companies were stockpiling but warned that retailers typically keep no more than two weeks\u2019 inventory. Food processors Premier Foods The owner of Mr Kipling, Ambrosia and Sharwoods, has said it is spending \u00a310m on Brexit preparations and has stockpiled both ingredients and its most popular products, such as Oxo cubes and Bisto gravy, to protect against port delays. Mondel\u0113z International The company behind Cadbury chocolates has been stockpiling ingredients as well as finished chocolates and biscuits. Ornua The Irish dairy company behind brands including Kerrygold and Pilgrims Choice, is stockpiling cheddar in the UK to ensure that its product can get to supermarket shelves and beat any shock price hike if the UK crashes out of the EU bloc on 29 March. World Trade Organization tariffs on cheddar are as high as 42%, and Irish cheesemakers fear sales would plummet if they had to pass on the full extra cost to the consumer. Of the 200,000 tonnes of cheese made a year in Ireland, 45,000 tonnes is cheddar exported to the UK. Unilever The Anglo-Dutch conglomerate has said it is stockpiling large supplies of Magnum ice-creams in the UK amid concerns about importing them from its factories in Italy and Germany. Unilever has also been building up stocks of materials to make and package products including aluminium, plastics and propellants.

Who would have thought? While these views appear shocking now, they aren\u2019t a particular point of astonishment to anybody who knows anything about Wayne, or cinema, or history.</p> <p>In one sense, revisiting Wayne\u2019s views is important: we should be mindful to revise and decolonise the film canon, and it\u2019s essential to reassess cinema\u2019s heroes in the light of our shifting politics. Many of the films that Wayne made rest on a completely racist ideal, which others and stigmatises non-white cultures, and claims America for white people. A quick trawl through critical writings on Wayne shows that our culture is still not adequately condemnatory of this: as recently as 2011, the critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/05/roger-ebert-stimulating-film-critic-dies\">Roger Ebert</a> could still write of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/22/stagecoach-western-john-wayne\">Stagecoach</a>, that: \u201cthe film\u2019s attitudes toward Native Americans are unenlightened. The Apaches are seen simply as murderous savages; there is no suggestion the white men have invaded their land ...

      "bodyText": "Dusting itself off after the excitement of Liam Neeson\u2019s racist meltdown, the film world has settled on its next talking point, an old interview of John Wayne, recently dug up, in which the actor is revealed to have been racist and homophobic. \u00a1Esc\u00e1ndalo! In the interview with Playboy magazine from 1971, the actor born Marion Morrison states, among other things \u201cI believe in white supremacy\u201d and calls Midnight Cowboy \u201ca story about two fags\u201d. Shocking stuff from an actor famous for his contribution to the notoriously liberal cowboys and indians genre, who supported Richard Nixon, and directed The Green Berets in support of the US Army during the Vietnam war. Who would have thought? While these views appear shocking now, they aren\u2019t a particular point of astonishment to anybody who knows anything about Wayne, or cinema, or history. In one sense, revisiting Wayne\u2019s views is important: we should be mindful to revise and decolonise the film canon, and it\u2019s essential to reassess cinema\u2019s heroes in the light of our shifting politics. Many of the films that Wayne made rest on a completely racist ideal, which others and stigmatises non-white cultures, and claims America for white people. A quick trawl through critical writings on Wayne shows that our culture is still not adequately condemnatory of this: as recently as 2011, the critic Roger Ebert could still write of Stagecoach, that: \u201cthe film\u2019s attitudes toward Native Americans are unenlightened. The Apaches are seen simply as murderous savages; there is no suggestion the white men have invaded their land ... Ford was not a racist, nor was Wayne, but they made films that were sadly unenlightened.\u201d Ebert\u2019s euphemism here is painfully insufficient. On the other hand, it\u2019s possible to feel a certain weariness about a new right-on mindset finding fault with, of all people, John Wayne. Who next, Charlton Heston? Ronald Reagan? Pity the modern film buff who happens, during their internet travels, upon Frank Sinatra\u2019s ill-advised links to organised crime!

      "body": "<p><em>Katharine Viner, the Guardian\u2019s editor-in-chief, reflects on the increasing inequality and fragmentation in our society, the far-reaching effects of austerity, and why the Guardian is making it its mission to seek out truth and use clarity and imagination to build hope. She also discusses how a pioneering business model keeps Guardian journalism entirely independent and accessible to a growing community of readers around the world.</em></p> <p><strong>In today\u2019s world, in which public spaces are increasingly privatised, communities are being torn apart by inequality, division and austerity, and more people are finding information in personal, individualised networks online, what role can the Guardian play in championing the public domain?</strong></p> <p>The Guardian is committed to the public sphere in all its forms, from public space to public education and public healthcare. Like all journalists working in the public interest, we believe in holding the powerful to account; at the Guardian we also believe that good information and good journalism should be as widely available as possible.</p> <p>From Guardian readers to Guardian journalists, to people who have never read the Guardian \u2014 we are all citizens and we all have a stake in the same future.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2018/nov/12/katharine-viner-guardian-million-reader-funding\">Katharine Viner: 'The Guardian's reader funding model is working. It's inspiring'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Our audience tell us that they want to ensure that more people are better informed, and that this is fundamental to the healthy functioning of democracies. They share a passion for the same issues as us \u2013 from the climate crisis to inequality to the influence of big technology companies on our lives.</p> <p>For example, they were very generous in supporting Carole Cadwalladr\u2019s reporting on the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\"> Cambridge Analytica scandal</a>, which cracked open a global debate on data, privacy and power which has had such a big impact around the world.</p> <p><strong>You have called this </strong><strong>a critical moment, one demanding that journalism connects with readers as citizens, and inspires them to engage with the world. A key element of this connection involves the Guardian\u2019s funding model. When many sites across the world have introduced paywalls,</strong><strong> why did the Guardian go in a different direction?</strong></p> <p>We\u2019ve decided not to put up a paywall, meaning that we don\u2019t restrict any of our journalism by asking readers to pay to access it. This is because we want Guardian journalism to be as widely accessible as possible - even in communities where they can\u2019t afford to pay for it. There are so few news organisations that are both based in facts and progressive in how they see the world; there are so few news organisations that you can trust; and there are hardly any news organisations that have an ownership structure like the Guardian\u2019s \u2014 we have no shareholders or proprietor and we are guaranteed to be free from political and commercial influence. Many readers have told us they contribute financially specifically because they want the Guardian to stay open and accessible to all, so that progressive journalism that is so clearly independent can have the widest possible impact.</p> <p><strong>Inequality is an issue you have set out as a priority for the Guardian to cover in-depth under your editorship. You have spoken about the excesses of neoliberalism fostering the huge divisions and resentment that we\u2019re seeing in the world. Can you tell us about the coverage you have prioritised in this area?</strong></p> <p>Extreme inequality is one of the biggest drivers behind the political shocks we\u2019ve seen in the last few years, and trying to understand it, contextualise it, find out what it\u2019s like to live it, and how it can be changed for the better, is part of what the Guardian needs to be doing right now. From Bolsonaro to Salvini to Trump; from the chaos of the Brexit negotiations to the widespread collapse of civic life, with vital services being starved of funding or outsourced or privatised - we must be reporting on both the events themselves and their impact on people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>Our aim is to report truthfully on how government policy and economic shifts affect people, which is a thread that runs through Guardian reporting and remains central to ongoing projects such as<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/anywhere-but-westminster\"> Anywhere But Westminster</a>, the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us/environment\"> impact of climate change globally</a>, and our series on<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/the-new-populism\"> the New Populism</a>.</p> <p>As well as examining and challenging the different power structures that produce and entrench inequality, I think one of the most important things we can do is inspire empathy in our audience when they read these articles, watch the Guardian\u2019s video journalism or listen to our podcasts. We want to help build understanding of how other people live and how that impacts broader society and politics.</p> <p><strong>Wealth disparity and income inequality have varied impacts in different parts of the world. As a former editor of both Guardian Australia and Guardian US, and now as editor-in-chief of Guardian News &amp; Media globally, how have you seen inequality manifest differently in different regions?</strong></p> <p>Poverty is a big issue in the US, where it is particularly linked to race, and we\u2019ve done some important reporting including tracking the UN\u2019s work as they document the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/15/america-extreme-poverty-un-special-rapporteur\"> extreme levels of deprivation</a>. In terms of immigration, our reporters analysed thousands of documents to provide a comprehensive picture of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2018/oct/14/donald-trump-zero-tolerance-policy-special-investigation-immigrant-journeys\"> what happened to those prosecuted</a> under the Trump administration\u2019s zero tolerance policy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/20/guardian-supporters-future-journalism\">Why readers are critical for the future of Guardian journalism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After the Parkland school shooting in Florida, we invited students from the school\u2019s magazine to come to our New York office and to report from the student march against gun violence in Washington DC. They directed our coverage for 48 hours in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/parkland-student-takeover\"> a powerful takeover of the site</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s important for our reporting in the US that we don\u2019t just focus on what Trump says on Twitter, for example, but also on what his administration is actually doing \u2014 for example, how dramatic tax cuts or new immigration policies entrench poverty.</p> <p>In Australia, poverty also has a link to race, and Indigenous Australians lead vastly more difficult lives than white Australians. We have a fantastic Indigenous affairs editor, Lorena Allam, who has helped shine a light on these issues and give a really informed perspective. We also have an excellent regular series called<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/life-on-the-breadline\"> Life on the breadline</a>, in which Australians write about their often shocking experiences of living in poverty.</p> <p>In Britain, the big story of inequality since 2010 has been the impact of austerity on local communities, and we\u2019ve taken care to report that deeply and seriously, whether it\u2019s the closure of libraries or the privatisation of parks. And in Britain too there\u2019s a link to race when it comes to inequality: think of Amelia Gentleman\u2019s 2018 revelations of the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\"> Windrush scandal</a>, or our recent<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/series/bias-in-britain\"> Bias in Britain</a> series, which revealed the everyday discrimination faced by minority ethnic people. We are committed to reporting every twist and turn of the Brexit process, and what it means for all parts of Britain, and we also want to continue to recognise that Brexit is about much more than Westminster politics. By really listening to people, we can identify and tell the important stories about the issues that led to the vote. We also want to ensure our European readers, and our readers around the world, know that regardless of Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU, the Guardian will be always be committed to Europe.</p> <p><strong>One million readers have given the Guardian their financial support in some form over the past three years. Why is this model so critical to the work the Guardian is doing?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s very important to the Guardian that our journalism has as much impact by reaching as many people as possible. It means more people have access to factual information, helpful analysis and interesting ideas about what\u2019s happening in the world, so they\u2019re better informed and empowered to make decisions in their own lives. We now have 180 million browsers all around the world each month, and readers who live in every country. Our readers help us by bringing us stories and ideas, and they help us understand where we may need to change our approach to a story.</p> <p>The fact that one million people have chosen to support Guardian journalism financially shows that many believe in our mission, our independence, and our reporting - and that\u2019s really inspiring to all of us who work at the Guardian. We hear from our supporters that they find this model, and the support of their fellow readers, inspiring too. We want to keep building on this model, and make the Guardian sustainable.

Why do you believe hope is so important in the current climate?</strong></p> <p>I was inspired by Rebecca Solnit\u2019s book<a href=\"http://rebeccasolnit.net/book/hope-in-the-dark-untold-histories-wild-possibilities/\"> Hope in the Dark</a>, in which Solnit argues that hope is not blind optimism; it is instead an engagement with the world, a way of facing what is happening, contextualising it, understanding it, and believing you have the power to change things for the better. Solnit shows that authentic hope requires both clarity and imagination, which are perfect concepts for a news organisation like the Guardian in a time like this \u2014 clarity, so you get the facts you need to understand the world, plus imagination, to provide new ideas to help make a better one.</p> <p>That seems to me an important thing that the Guardian can do for its audience in this time of crisis. Together, with our readers and supporters, that adds up to something meaningful, that I think is a kind of hope.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Support our journalism by <a href=\"https://support.theguardian.com/contribute?acquisitionData=%7B%22componentType%22%3A%22ACQUISITIONS_EDITORIAL_LINK%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22GUARDIAN_WEB%22%2C%22campaignCode%22%3A%22eiditorial_kath_open_2019%22%2C%22componentId%22%3A%22editorial_open_2019%22%7D&amp;INTCMP=eiditorial_kath_open_2019\">making a contribution</a> or <a href=\"https://support.theguardian.com/subscribe?acquisitionData=%7B%22componentType%22%3A%22ACQUISITIONS_EDITORIAL_LINK%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22GUARDIAN_WEB%22%2C%22campaignCode%22%3A%22eiditorial_kath_open_2019%22%2C%22componentId%22%3A%22editorial_open_2019%22%7D&amp;INTCMP=eiditorial_kath_open_2019\">subscribing</a><br></strong></em></p></li> </ul>",

In today\u2019s world, in which public spaces are increasingly privatised, communities are being torn apart by inequality, division and austerity, and more people are finding information in personal, individualised networks online, what role can the Guardian play in championing the public domain? The Guardian is committed to the public sphere in all its forms, from public space to public education and public healthcare. Like all journalists working in the public interest, we believe in holding the powerful to account; at the Guardian we also believe that good information and good journalism should be as widely available as possible. From Guardian readers to Guardian journalists, to people who have never read the Guardian \u2014 we are all citizens and we all have a stake in the same future. Our audience tell us that they want to ensure that more people are better informed, and that this is fundamental to the healthy functioning of democracies. They share a passion for the same issues as us \u2013 from the climate crisis to inequality to the influence of big technology companies on our lives. For example, they were very generous in supporting Carole Cadwalladr\u2019s reporting on the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which cracked open a global debate on data, privacy and power which has had such a big impact around the world. You have called this a critical moment, one demanding that journalism connects with readers as citizens, and inspires them to engage with the world. A key element of this connection involves the Guardian\u2019s funding model. When many sites across the world have introduced paywalls, why did the Guardian go in a different direction? We\u2019ve decided not to put up a paywall, meaning that we don\u2019t restrict any of our journalism by asking readers to pay to access it. This is because we want Guardian journalism to be as widely accessible as possible - even in communities where they can\u2019t afford to pay for it. There are so few news organisations that are both based in facts and progressive in how they see the world; there are so few news organisations that you can trust; and there are hardly any news organisations that have an ownership structure like the Guardian\u2019s \u2014 we have no shareholders or proprietor and we are guaranteed to be free from political and commercial influence. Many readers have told us they contribute financially specifically because they want the Guardian to stay open and accessible to all, so that progressive journalism that is so clearly independent can have the widest possible impact. Inequality is an issue you have set out as a priority for the Guardian to cover in-depth under your editorship. You have spoken about the excesses of neoliberalism fostering the huge divisions and resentment that we\u2019re seeing in the world. Can you tell us about the coverage you have prioritised in this area? Extreme inequality is one of the biggest drivers behind the political shocks we\u2019ve seen in the last few years, and trying to understand it, contextualise it, find out what it\u2019s like to live it, and how it can be changed for the better, is part of what the Guardian needs to be doing right now. From Bolsonaro to Salvini to Trump; from the chaos of the Brexit negotiations to the widespread collapse of civic life, with vital services being starved of funding or outsourced or privatised - we must be reporting on both the events themselves and their impact on people\u2019s lives. Our aim is to report truthfully on how government policy and economic shifts affect people, which is a thread that runs through Guardian reporting and remains central to ongoing projects such as Anywhere But Westminster, the impact of climate change globally, and our series on the New Populism. As well as examining and challenging the different power structures that produce and entrench inequality, I think one of the most important things we can do is inspire empathy in our audience when they read these articles, watch the Guardian\u2019s video journalism or listen to our podcasts. We want to help build understanding of how other people live and how that impacts broader society and politics. Wealth disparity and income inequality have varied impacts in different parts of the world. As a former editor of both Guardian Australia and Guardian US, and now as editor-in-chief of Guardian News &amp; Media globally, how have you seen inequality manifest differently in different regions? Poverty is a big issue in the US, where it is particularly linked to race, and we\u2019ve done some important reporting including tracking the UN\u2019s work as they document the extreme levels of deprivation. In terms of immigration, our reporters analysed thousands of documents to provide a comprehensive picture of what happened to those prosecuted under the Trump administration\u2019s zero tolerance policy. After the Parkland school shooting in Florida, we invited students from the school\u2019s magazine to come to our New York office and to report from the student march against gun violence in Washington DC. They directed our coverage for 48 hours in a powerful takeover of the site. It\u2019s important for our reporting in the US that we don\u2019t just focus on what Trump says on Twitter, for example, but also on what his administration is actually doing \u2014 for example, how dramatic tax cuts or new immigration policies entrench poverty. In Australia, poverty also has a link to race, and Indigenous Australians lead vastly more difficult lives than white Australians. We have a fantastic Indigenous affairs editor, Lorena Allam, who has helped shine a light on these issues and give a really informed perspective. We also have an excellent regular series called Life on the breadline, in which Australians write about their often shocking experiences of living in poverty. In Britain, the big story of inequality since 2010 has been the impact of austerity on local communities, and we\u2019ve taken care to report that deeply and seriously, whether it\u2019s the closure of libraries or the privatisation of parks. And in Britain too there\u2019s a link to race when it comes to inequality: think of Amelia Gentleman\u2019s 2018 revelations of the Windrush scandal, or our recent Bias in Britain series, which revealed the everyday discrimination faced by minority ethnic people. We are committed to reporting every twist and turn of the Brexit process, and what it means for all parts of Britain, and we also want to continue to recognise that Brexit is about much more than Westminster politics. By really listening to people, we can identify and tell the important stories about the issues that led to the vote. We also want to ensure our European readers, and our readers around the world, know that regardless of Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU, the Guardian will be always be committed to Europe. One million readers have given the Guardian their financial support in some form over the past three years. Why is this model so critical to the work the Guardian is doing? It\u2019s very important to the Guardian that our journalism has as much impact by reaching as many people as possible. It means more people have access to factual information, helpful analysis and interesting ideas about what\u2019s happening in the world, so they\u2019re better informed and empowered to make decisions in their own lives. We now have 180 million browsers all around the world each month, and readers who live in every country. Our readers help us by bringing us stories and ideas, and they help us understand where we may need to change our approach to a story. The fact that one million people have chosen to support Guardian journalism financially shows that many believe in our mission, our independence, and our reporting - and that\u2019s really inspiring to all of us who work at the Guardian. We hear from our supporters that they find this model, and the support of their fellow readers, inspiring too. We want to keep building on this model, and make the Guardian sustainable. For those who want to support us, there are many different ways, through making a single or recurring contribution, by becoming a Patron, by subscribing to our weekly news magazine Guardian Weekly, or our new premium app and of course buying or subscribing to the Guardian and Observer newspapers. A central tenet of the purpose you have set out for the Guardian in your essay, A mission for journalism in a time of crisis, is hope. Why do you believe hope is so important in the current climate? I was inspired by Rebecca Solnit\u2019s book Hope in the Dark, in which Solnit argues that hope is not blind optimism; it is instead an engagement with the world, a way of facing what is happening, contextualising it, understanding it, and believing you have the power to change things for the better. Solnit shows that authentic hope requires both clarity and imagination, which are perfect concepts for a news organisation like the Guardian in a time like this \u2014 clarity, so you get the facts you need to understand the world, plus imagination, to provide new ideas to help make a better one. That seems to me an important thing that the Guardian can do for its audience in this time of crisis. Together, with our readers and supporters, that adds up to something meaningful, that I think is a kind of hope. Support our journalism by making a contribution or subscribing",

About 150 people from Extinction Rebellion formed human roadblocks and brought traffic to a standstill outside event venues on Sunday to cause disruption and urge the industry body to declare a climate emergency. Farrell, who is also a spokeswoman for the direct action group, said she was approached by a police officer who addressed her by name when she was in the queue for the Bethany Williams show at 180 The Strand, London, on Tuesday afternoon, and was told she was not allowed to enter. \u201cThe police liaison officer said I could queue up but that the venue wouldn\u2019t let me in,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cShe referenced Extinction Rebellion and pointed to a badge I was wearing.\u201d Farrell, a fashion designer, said that she had helped produce Williams\u2019 line, which is dedicated to social justice and sustainability, and that she had not been intending to protest at the event. \u201cTo exclude a designer who was both involved in the production of the line and working to bring attention to the climate and ecological crises from the show is just unbelievable,\u201d she added. The group said Farrell had a ticket for the show, and that staff at the venue were informed of her multiple roles in the production of Williams\u2019 award-winning line. Williams was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II design award for her work, which addresses environmental issues, by the Duchess of Cornwall on Tuesday night. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said: \u201cOn Tuesday 19 February, the organisers of a private event taking place on The Strand in central London took a decision not to admit a member of the public to their event. This decision was conveyed to the member of the public by a police officer at the scene.\u201d On Sunday, the British Fashion Council said that it was \u201cpleased that we live in a country where we have a right to protest peacefully\u201d. It said in a statement: \u201cWe believe that more than any other capital, London has an opportunity to be a part of a cultural change around sustainable business practices that put creative product at their core. \u201cThis week we hope to both encourage the showcasing of these creative businesses whilst increasing the dialogue around mindful consumerism, one that we are raising ourselves through our Positive Fashion programme.\u201d The British Fashion Council has been contacted for further comment.",

His ability to adjust mid-game if needed should not be in doubt and the players will be with him however that pans out. I have never seen him coaching teams close up but I have talked to a lot of players and staff who have worked with him and, like a stick of Blackpool rock, his ability to man-manage people brilliantly runs through all of his coaching career. He has a knack of using the right tone and message on an individual basis to get the belief and purpose a player or staff member needs. He\u2019s not perfect and some of his planning has gone awry in the past but when that has happened he is first to put up his hand and learn from it. The lettering in those sticks of hard candy may look simple enough but it\u2019s a process that only a few have mastered. Like those sugary sayings, even if you bite all the way down, they remain. Wales may or may not edge the battle on Saturday but in Gatland they have a leader who will have given them every chance from the first to the last blast of Peyper\u2019s whistle. \u2022 Ben Ryan coached Fiji to Olympic gold in the men\u2019s Rugby Sevens at Rio 2016. He is now consultant to leading sports organisations, including the French Rugby Federation and UK Sport",

      "body": "<p>Ayesha Casely-Hayford remembers the \u201cfizz of excitement\u201d she felt auditioning for an unorthodox revival of Oscar Wilde\u2019s comedy <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/importance-of-being-earnest-characters-and-plot/\">The Importance of Being Earnest</a>. So unorthodox, in fact, that two black women were to play all its nine parts.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I first heard that this is what they were doing I thought \u2018huh?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt was such a blank sheet of paper but the possibilities of voice, accent and character development seemed endless.\u201d</p> <p>The actor, who is British-born with Ghanaian and white English heritage, is now set to star in the production alongside Zimbabwean-born Kudzanayi Chiwawa at Tara theatre, London. They perform all the roles and share the part of the imperious Lady Bracknell. Who gets the handbag line? \u201cI do,\u201d says Casely-Hayford. The bag, abandoned with baby Jack inside it, has been irreverently updated to a branded Sports Direct holdall.</p> <p>Unconventional casting isn\u2019t the only surprising element; the play is no longer set in the upper echelons of Victorian society but in an indeterminate future where concepts of class, race and Britishness are turned upside down. Lady Bracknell is a west African-born woman married to a white British man while Miss Prism speaks English with a Trinidadian twang.</p> <p>This radical retelling of a canonical play is typical of the theatre company <a href=\"http://www.twogentsproductions.co.uk/\">Two Gents</a>, co-producing the show with <a href=\"https://www.tara-arts.com/\">Tara Arts</a>. They have won acclaim with their Africanised versions of Shakespeare plays, performed by a cast of two men on no-frills stage sets. The artistic directors, Tonderai Munyevu and Arne Pohlmeier, are co-directing and feel that it resonates with the themes that underpin the purpose of their company: issues of migration, displacement and identity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc39a994d7db9b075cb7b59ab096ec4aa23fa8d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc39a994d7db9b075cb7b59ab096ec4aa23fa8d7/205_148_2444_1467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Everett as Algernon and Judi Dench as Lady Bracknell in the 2002 film The Importance of Being Earnest, directed by Oliver Parker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Everett as Algernon and Judi Dench as Lady Bracknell in the 2002 film The Importance of Being Earnest, directed by Oliver Parker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Ealing Studios/Film Council</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Munyevu, a British Zimbabwean, says that for all the play\u2019s ostensible frivolity and parlour games with mistaken identities and doubleness, there is a hard, raw, truth at its centre that chimes with the times we live in today.</p> <p>\u201cArne wanted to explore the truth that\u2019s at the bottom of this play. Reading it again, I see how every conversation in it is a boxing match. One person is trying to be bigger and better than the other person and I think that this is where we are now [in the UK] . We are in a battleground, trying to point-score. We were even thinking of staging it in a boxing ring at one point.\u201d</p> <p>Casely-Hayford agrees, though she feels, more simply, that its edge and urgency comes from the fact that a progressive theatre company is staging it. And you don\u2019t have to search hard to find outsiders, migrants, the quietly distraught and dispossessed, however quietly they carry their traumas, she adds. \u201cWe very quickly found our own access into it. There is Wilde himself, who was a homosexual in a time when it was illegal but there is also Algernon, an orphan who presents himself as flamboyant and wealthy but in reality he is broke, in hiding and there\u2019s a devastation to the various brutal aspects of what he\u2019s going through. So you begin to see the migrant narrative of trying to survive, to make do. Every character is needing to be in a different place, redefining themselves.\u201d</p> <p>This is the first time Munyevu has directed a Two Gents production. He launched the company as an actor in 2008 along with Pohlmeier, a German-born director, and fellow Zimbabwean actor Denton Chikura (who has since left).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5326898fa292152a1ab29b6e486855b8dde6458\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5326898fa292152a1ab29b6e486855b8dde6458/0_1734_6096_3657/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turning the Two Gents dynamic upside down \u2026 The Importance of Being Earnest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turning the Two Gents dynamic upside down \u2026 The Importance of Being Earnest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry Elletson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pohlmeier had lived in post Apartheid-era South Africa and he suggested they model Two Gents on the protest theatre he had seen spring up on the streets, always involving two black men playing every role with minimal sets or props. \u201cThey performed out of a bag so that it could all be dismantled before the police caught them,\u201d says Munyevu.</p> <p>He was keen to be part of a same-sex company so it would open up more roles for him. At his London drama school, Munyevu had been told that he didn\u2019t look masculine enough and that he would never find work. It was a damning judgment and one he proved wrong by making a virtue of playing both sexes in Two Gents productions.</p> <p>That was in 2008. Since then, they have performed across Britain and toured the world with retellings of classic plays such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/nov/15/the-entertainer-two-gentlemen-verona\">Vakomana Vaviri Ve Zimbabwe</a> (The Two Gentlemen of Verona) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8Ctxx3ONI0\">Kupenga KwaHamlet</a> (The Madness of Hamlet), which combine Shakespeare texts with African dance, song, history and myth. The script is always edited, but Munyevu does not dwell too much on the sacrosanctity of the original. It is used as a starting point, he says. \u201cHow else are we going to talk about who we are?\u201d</p> <p>This play brought its own particular challenge for a company that has only worked with men. By casting women for the two-hander \u201cwe wanted to turn the Two Gents dynamic upside down. If we had cast two black men, we would have had a completely different show,\u201d says Munyevu.</p> <p>Another striking feature of the play, which is a key part of every Two Gents performance, is its connection with the audience. \u201cWith us, the proscenium arch does not even exist,\u201d he says. \u201cThe idea of a Two Gents show is that you are two actors telling a story and the audience is not passive. We bring them up on stage, we speak to them, they speak to us. Sometimes we stop and ask them \u2018Are you following?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d says Casely-Hayford. \u201cWe ask them to speak and they do. It\u2019s a case of how to stop them by the end of the show.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>The Importance of Being Earnest is at <a href=\"https://www.tara-arts.com/whats-on/the-importance-of-being-earnest\">Tara theatre, London</a>, 27 February\u201316 March.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Ayesha Casely-Hayford remembers the \u201cfizz of excitement\u201d she felt auditioning for an unorthodox revival of Oscar Wilde\u2019s comedy The Importance of Being Earnest. So unorthodox, in fact, that two black women were to play all its nine parts. \u201cWhen I first heard that this is what they were doing I thought \u2018huh?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt was such a blank sheet of paper but the possibilities of voice, accent and character development seemed endless.\u201d The actor, who is British-born with Ghanaian and white English heritage, is now set to star in the production alongside Zimbabwean-born Kudzanayi Chiwawa at Tara theatre, London. They perform all the roles and share the part of the imperious Lady Bracknell. Who gets the handbag line? \u201cI do,\u201d says Casely-Hayford. The bag, abandoned with baby Jack inside it, has been irreverently updated to a branded Sports Direct holdall. Unconventional casting isn\u2019t the only surprising element; the play is no longer set in the upper echelons of Victorian society but in an indeterminate future where concepts of class, race and Britishness are turned upside down. Lady Bracknell is a west African-born woman married to a white British man while Miss Prism speaks English with a Trinidadian twang. This radical retelling of a canonical play is typical of the theatre company Two Gents, co-producing the show with Tara Arts. They have won acclaim with their Africanised versions of Shakespeare plays, performed by a cast of two men on no-frills stage sets. The artistic directors, Tonderai Munyevu and Arne Pohlmeier, are co-directing and feel that it resonates with the themes that underpin the purpose of their company: issues of migration, displacement and identity. Munyevu, a British Zimbabwean, says that for all the play\u2019s ostensible frivolity and parlour games with mistaken identities and doubleness, there is a hard, raw, truth at its centre that chimes with the times we live in today. \u201cArne wanted to explore the truth that\u2019s at the bottom of this play. Reading it again, I see how every conversation in it is a boxing match. One person is trying to be bigger and better than the other person and I think that this is where we are now [in the UK] . We are in a battleground, trying to point-score. We were even thinking of staging it in a boxing ring at one point.\u201d Casely-Hayford agrees, though she feels, more simply, that its edge and urgency comes from the fact that a progressive theatre company is staging it. And you don\u2019t have to search hard to find outsiders, migrants, the quietly distraught and dispossessed, however quietly they carry their traumas, she adds. \u201cWe very quickly found our own access into it. There is Wilde himself, who was a homosexual in a time when it was illegal but there is also Algernon, an orphan who presents himself as flamboyant and wealthy but in reality he is broke, in hiding and there\u2019s a devastation to the various brutal aspects of what he\u2019s going through. So you begin to see the migrant narrative of trying to survive, to make do. Every character is needing to be in a different place, redefining themselves.\u201d This is the first time Munyevu has directed a Two Gents production. He launched the company as an actor in 2008 along with Pohlmeier, a German-born director, and fellow Zimbabwean actor Denton Chikura (who has since left). Pohlmeier had lived in post Apartheid-era South Africa and he suggested they model Two Gents on the protest theatre he had seen spring up on the streets, always involving two black men playing every role with minimal sets or props. \u201cThey performed out of a bag so that it could all be dismantled before the police caught them,\u201d says Munyevu. He was keen to be part of a same-sex company so it would open up more roles for him. At his London drama school, Munyevu had been told that he didn\u2019t look masculine enough and that he would never find work. It was a damning judgment and one he proved wrong by making a virtue of playing both sexes in Two Gents productions. That was in 2008. Since then, they have performed across Britain and toured the world with retellings of classic plays such as Vakomana Vaviri Ve Zimbabwe (The Two Gentlemen of Verona) and Kupenga KwaHamlet (The Madness of Hamlet), which combine Shakespeare texts with African dance, song, history and myth. The script is always edited, but Munyevu does not dwell too much on the sacrosanctity of the original. It is used as a starting point, he says. \u201cHow else are we going to talk about who we are?\u201d This play brought its own particular challenge for a company that has only worked with men. By casting women for the two-hander \u201cwe wanted to turn the Two Gents dynamic upside down. If we had cast two black men, we would have had a completely different show,\u201d says Munyevu. Another striking feature of the play, which is a key part of every Two Gents performance, is its connection with the audience. \u201cWith us, the proscenium arch does not even exist,\u201d he says. \u201cThe idea of a Two Gents show is that you are two actors telling a story and the audience is not passive. We bring them up on stage, we speak to them, they speak to us. Sometimes we stop and ask them \u2018Are you following?\u2019\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d says Casely-Hayford. \u201cWe ask them to speak and they do. It\u2019s a case of how to stop them by the end of the show.\u201d The Importance of Being Earnest is at Tara theatre, London, 27 February\u201316 March.",

      "bodyText": "Andrew Tyrie was only appointed as head of the Competition and Markets Authority in April 2018, after retiring as an MP. He has already made his mark within 12 months, with a decision which could affect the lives of millions of Britons. The Sainsbury\u2019s-Asda merger is not out for the count yet, but it is on the ropes after the CMA said it is \u201clikely to be difficult\u201d for its concerns to be assuaged. The deal, which the supermarkets are still pursuing, would create a new giant in the British grocery sector \u2013 a prospect the competition regulator cannot yet stomach. Sainsbury\u2019s boss Mike Coupe reacted angrily to the decision, which threatens a deal he had welcomed so enthusiastically when it was first announced in April 2018. The European Medicines Agency has lost a court battle to cancel a \u00a3500m lease on its old Canary Wharf headquarters which it said was invalidated by Brexit. Landlord Canary Wharf Group successfully took the agency, which was forced to leave London, to the court to enforce the contract, which lasts until 2039. Full story here. A healthcheck on British manufacturing from the Confederation of British Industry gave mixed messages. Output growth slowed, but there was some improvement in order books. Across the Channel, a French court has fined Swiss investment bank UBS \u20ac4.5bn for tax fraud and illegal solicitation of clients. The bank denies the charges and will appeal. Thanks for joining us today. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow as always with rolling coverage of economics, markets and corporate news. JJ US markets have opened with barely a flutter. Tumbleweed on Wall Street with barely any movement on trade talks between the US and China. The Nasdaq, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have all moved by less than 0.05% either way. A French court today ruled that UBS must pay fines totaling \u20ac4.5bn (\u00a33.9bn) after the Swiss investment bank was found to have illegally solicited clients in France and to have laundered the proceeds of tax evasion. The penalties, which exceed the bank\u2019s net profit last year, included a \u20ac3.7bn fine and additional damages of \u20ac800m to the French state, Reuters reported. The damages are larger than UBS\u2019s profits last year, and more than double the amount the bank had set aside to cover legal costs. The ruling marks the culmination of a seven-year investigation and aborted settlement negotiations. French prosecutors said UBS sent Swiss bankers to golf tournaments, classical music concerts and hunting parties to solicit new clients illegally. UBS was \u201csystematic\u201d in its support to tax-evading customers and that the laundering of proceeds from the tax fraud was done on an \u201cindustrial\u201d scale, the prosecutors had told the court. The bank said it will appeal the verdict and denied all the charges. In a statement UBS said: UBS strongly disagrees with the verdict. The bank has consistently contested any criminal wrongdoing in this case throughout the investigation and during the trial. The conviction is not supported by any concrete evidence, but instead is based on the unfounded allegations of former employees who were not even heard at the trial. The head of the UK\u2019s cybersecurity agency today appeared to suggest that security risks posed by Huawei can be managed, in a boost to the embattled Chinese telecoms company. Huawei has been banned from 5G mobile network infrastructure in multiple countries because of security concerns, led by the US, but the UK has taken a more sanguine view. Ciaran Martin, the chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre, on Wednesday said government oversight of Huawei has proven it can flag up security problems, suggesting he doesn\u2019t think the Chinese company needs to be banned from supplying mobile networks, according to the Associated Press. He also said that one of the conditions for maintaining good cybersecurity is having \u201csustainable diversity\u201d in the telecommunications equipment supplier market. The UK will decide its 5G security policies in the spring after government analysis is completed. Lloyds Banking Group has shrugged off growing fears over Brexit as it unveiled a \u00a34bn payout to shareholders, despite reporting smaller-than-expected annual profits. Read the full story here: The European Medicines Agency, which is moving from Britain to Amsterdam owing to Brexit, on Wednesday lost a court battle to cancel the lease on its London headquarters. The EMA\u2019s lease on offices in the Canary Wharf business district runs until 2039 and is worth an estimated \u00a3500m, reports AFP. The EMA evaluates and supervises medicines for human and animal use and has been based in Canary Wharf since 1995. The EU said the agency and its 900 staff had to move to a member country following the UK\u2019s vote to leave. The EMA argued that Brexit meant its lease had been \u201cfrustrated\u201d, meaning it was impossible to fulfill. However, the high court said the EMA is still under obligation to pay for the lease, giving a significant victory to Canary Wharf Group, the owners of the east London development. It has not been a great day for British retail and the closely related property industry, with Intu Properties the biggest faller on the FTSE 250. Shares in the owner of the MetroCentre in Gateshead and Manchester\u2019s Trafford Centre fell by more than 8% on Wednesday after it scrapped its dividend following a spate of retail failures. The company, which is also trying to lower its debt, said it would look to sell some assets in the UK and Spain, though it was holding off on British disposals while Brexit-related uncertainty was seriously impacting investor sentiment. John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: \u201cIntu has taken a large hit from writing down the value of its portfolio by \u00a31.4bn and has seen underlying earnings fall from \u00a3201m to \u00a3193.1m. On top of that, debt has increased to \u00a34.9bn and is now worth 53.1% of its assets. The company has been the subject of takeover activity and speculation over the last year, but as this has subsided attention is now on the future. As things stand, the business is caught in a catch-22 of needing to cut its debt but also having to invest in its centres, which makes it difficult to see where Intu goes next.\u201d Halfway through the British trading day and European stock market investors are having a more pleasant day than yesterday. Germany\u2019s Dax index is leading the way, with a 0.3% gain. The FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250 have both gained around 0.2%. The CBI\u2019s manufacturing data presents some mixed messages, say City economists. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cAn overall better-than-expected CBI industrial trends survey that points to the manufacturing sector being relatively resilient in February despite a lacklustre domestic economy, a weaker global economic environment and heightened Brexit uncertainties.\u201d \u201cThe pick-up in overall orders in February appears to have been due to better domestic and international demand,\u201d he said, but \u201cdespite the pick-up in orders, manufacturers\u2019 near-term output expectations softened appreciably in February.\u201d Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the order books number \u201clikely is misleadingly strong\u201d. The pick-up in the total orders balance in February to its 2018 average level suggests that the recent downturn in manufacturing output is just a blip, but we doubt it is giving an accurate steer at present. Three MPs have resigned the Conservative whip today, joining the independent group of ex-Labour MPs who broke away from their former party on Monday, in a move which could affect Brexit negotiations. Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen \u2013 all of whom backed a second referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the EU \u2013 said the Tories had moved to the right, particularly on Brexit. The defections may add to pressure on the government to soften its stance on Brexit, although the overall calculation for Prime Minister Theresa May has not changed fundamentally, given the MPs\u2019 record on the issue. Follow it on the politics live blog: Output growth from UK manufacturers slowed in the three months to February, according to the latest survey of the sector by the Confederation of British Industry. However, order books for domestic and export markets improved slightly from a weaker January, to remain above the average since 1995. The balance of firms saying total orders had increased rather than decreased rose to 6%, up from a negative 1% reading in January. There was also evidence of increased stockbuilding, with the balance rising to 10%, the highest since May 2018. Anna Leach, the CBI\u2019s head of economic intelligence, said: \u201cUK manufacturing activity has moderated at the same time as headwinds from Brexit uncertainty and a weaker global trading environment have grown. The time for Brexit compromise to support the UK manufacturing industry is now. The clock is ticking quickly towards crisis point. The FTSE 100 is roughly flat at mid-morning trading, with stronger performances from easyJet and Lloyds Banking Group sustaining London\u2019s blue-chip index. Lloyds shares rose by almost 3% after it revealed a \u00a34bn dividend and share buyback plan, although its \u00a34.4bn profits came in slightly below expectations. The big business news earlier this week was Honda\u2019s decision to close its Swindon factory in 2021. Honda insisted that its reasons had nothing to do with Brexit, triggering an intense debate. The Japanese carmaker yesterday said 7,000 jobs will likely go \u2013 3,500 in Swindon and the same again at suppliers and subsidiaries. It is \u201cfanciful\u201d to say Brexit was not an issue, according to David Warren, a former British ambassador to Japan. The Guardian\u2019s Rob Davies gives much the same verdict as with Nissan\u2019s u-turn on building its new X-Trail SUV in Sunderland: the ebbing away of confidence in Britain as a place to invest should be of grave concern, not just in the automotive sector but far beyond. The UK\u2019s leading consumer group says it will call for the CMA to block Sainsbury\u2019s-Asda deal if the extensive issues the competition regulator identified are not addressed. Which? has previously argued that it is not clear whether the \u00a3500m benefits highlighted by the supermarkets will be enjoyed by consumers or shareholders. Alex Neill, managing director of Which? Home Services, said: \u201cThe provisional findings of the CMA\u2019s investigation into the merger between these supermarkets echo our own concerns about its potential impact for shoppers, and so we will be watching closely to ensure that these are addressed. If the merger is set to cause the range of problems that these findings indicate, including shoppers facing increased prices, reduced quality and a poorer shopping experience, then the CMA must intervene to prevent it from going ahead. Clive Black, veteran retail analyst at Shore Capital, has just talked to us on the Sainsbury\u2019s-Asda merger. He says he has been critical of the CMA in the past, but reckons the watchdog \u201cdeserves some credit\u2019 for its provisional verdict on the planned Sainsbury\u2019s-Asda merger \u2013 noting that the proposed remedies \u201cmore or less eviscerate it\u201d. Black lambasted Sainsbury\u2019s \u201cbombastic arrogance\u201d in its recent statements \u2013 in particular its promise of a 10% price cut on everyday items, which he said lacked any detail. A duopoly doesn\u2019t tend to work in consumers\u2019 interests. He added: \u201cSainsbury\u2019s and Asda may go back and look at the legal challenge to the CMA, but they will have racked up massive fees. Sainsbury\u2019s were \u00a317m in the first half of the financial year, and that\u2019s going to mushroom.\u201d In case you had forgotten on a morning dominated by a resolutely non-Brexit story, the clock is very much still ticking. There are 37 days to go until the UK is scheduled to leave the EU. There is still no deal in place. In the latest in our series on the Brexit frontline, Julia Kollewe looks at how pharmaceutical companies across the UK are preparing for a possible no-deal Brexit. The effects could ripple throughout the country, as the example of GlaxoSmithKline below shows. Read more for more detail on the \u201cbiggest logistical challenge ever faced by the industry\u201d: Glencore, the FTSE 100 mining and commodities trading company, has surprised investors with a pledge to limit coal production \u201cbroadly to current levels\u201d. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that coal has no role to play in a low-carbon future, but Glencore has recently made acquisitions in the coal industry and previously made forecasts of increased production of the thermal coal used for power generation \u2013 a major source of carbon dioxide emissions. Glencore will \u201cprioritise capital investment to grow production of commodities essential to the energy and mobility transition\u201d, it said. Keeping production at current levels of 94.4m tonnes in 2018 would still mean Glencore remains one of the world\u2019s biggest coal companies. Nevertheless, the move was cautiously welcomed by campaigners, including the Church of England, which controls a large pension fund. Carlota Garcia-Manas, senior investment stewardship analyst at the Church of England\u2019s Commissioners, said: \u201cThis is a significant development in the alignment of diversified mining with the Paris climate goals. The simple truth is that in the absence of commercially viable carbon capture and storage, coal has no long-term future in the energy mix.\u201d Jeanne Martin, senior campaigns officer at ShareAction, says: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a good step forward for Glencore \u2013 the black sheep of the energy world \u2013 which for far too long refused to come out in support of the Paris Agreement. However, it\u2019s actions, not words, that matter. Glencore\u2019s South East Asian coal frenzy will be a true test of the company\u2019s commitment to the Paris goals. ShareAction will watch closely to make sure Glencore stays faithful to today\u2019s commitments. Sainsbury\u2019s angry reaction on Monday to the findings has not been welcomed. It comes after a rancorous competition investigation in which the supermarkets launched a pre-Christmas legal challenge against the CMA in an effort to gain extra time. Referring to Sainsbury\u2019s, Clive Black and Darren Shirley, analysts at Shore Capital, said: We believe it is bordering on laughable for the Group to state; \u2018We are surprised that the CMA would choose to reject the opportunity to put money directly into customers\u2019 pockets\u2019, when we always felt that [the promise of] 10% price cuts on unspecified products on an unspecified timeframe was playing to the galleries. Sainsbury looks like it has misunderstood the consumer and the CMA. They added: \u201cThe deal looks to have suffered a mortal blow.\u201d Would the deal as proposed have benefited British shoppers? The Competition and Markets Authority was right to put significant demands on any merger, according to John Colley, professor of practice at Warwick Business School. Choice will be reduced as there will be only one major competitor and the market is already highly competitive as Aldi and Lidl offer low prices, which the big four either have to meet, or offer better value in terms of range, quality, and service. Major savings through the merger in terms of reduced overheads, buying prices, and store closures will not be passed onto consumers unless there is a major change in the competitive landscape. This seems unlikely as it is not clear than Amazon are going to enter the grocery market with any substance. Everyone, rich or poor, has to buy groceries, so the CMA\u2019s final decision will affect everyone. However, it seems the only major beneficiaries of this merger would be the Asda-Sainsbury\u2019s shareholders. Perhaps the biggest problem for Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda is the sheer size of their networks. The deal would combine two of the top three supermarkets, reducing competition among the top power players. However, there is another dynamic at play: the fall in market share endured by the big British brands as German discounters Lidl and Aldi gained ground. Some analysts had thought that the growth of the discounters could help persuade competition regulators that there is still enough choice for consumers. It is safe to say that Mike Coupe is not happy with the CMA. \u201cThey have fundamentally moved the goalposts, changed the shape of the ball and chosen a different playing field,\u201d he told BBC radio. A UK plc with Brexit looming, and a completely unpredictable set of competition rules, who would invest in this country? This is just outrageous. Read the full story here: So will it still happen? Analysts do not sound hopeful. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, a consultancy, said the findings \u201cdeliver a hammer blow to the potential tie-up\u201d. Competition in the industry is fiercer than ever before and at the heart of this proposed deal is the need to drive further efficiencies through scale. However, the strength of the CMA\u2019s objections could put paid to the strategy. The scope of any potential recommendations in the final stage may be too much to swallow for the deal to survive. Analysts at Jefferies, the US investment bank, think Asda\u2019s US owner, Walmart, could be forced to look elsewhere. Walmart is thought to be keen to offload the Leeds-based UK supermarket. The deal is \u201cunlikely to be cleared given concerns around impact on competition at both national and local level\u201d, Jefferies analysts said. \u201cWe assume a private equity bid for ASDA to emerge swiftly,\u201d they said. Back on those potential remedies. The supermarkets quickly came out and said they will continue to push for the deal to go through, so what can they actually do now? Before the CMA\u2019s findings most analysts\u2019 thinking was concentrated on the number of divestitures: selling off stores in areas where competition would be affected. The problem with this path is that supermarkets are more than their shop fronts, relying on extensive logistics networks as well. Any new owner would have to be big and experienced enough to be able to take on the stores, while also not reducing competition at the same time. \u201cDivestiture carries a significant risk of being an ineffective remedy\u201d, the CMA said. It is not clear at this stage that a suitable package of assets could be found to provide an effective and comprehensive remedy. The CMA\u2019s findings will heap pressure on executives at both supermarkets, who had tried to sell the deal as one which would give customers a 10% price cut. Sainsbury\u2019s boss Mike Coupe became the face of the deal last year when he was caught singing on camera before an interview with ITV. His choice of Broadway number, \u201cWe\u2019re in the Money\u201d, proved unfortunate. Coupe argued in April last year that the deal would actually boost competition, with benefits for customers, staff and suppliers \u2013 as well as shareholders. The CMA knows this will be a contentious decision, and has got out of the traps early in trying to persuade the public on Twitter. The problems with the deal should perhaps have been more obvious, says an ex-competition watchdog. Coupe has already dismissed the inevitable speculation that his job may be under threat. A reminder that the market value of Sainsbury\u2019s last night was \u00a36.34bn. Shares are now down by 15%. A fall of that magnitude, if sustained today, would translate to well over \u00a3900m wiped off its value \u2013 although the real losers will be those who bought in after the deal was announced. On current performance Sainsbury\u2019s is due for its worst trading day since October 2008, the height of the financial crisis. The FTSE 100 has risen by 0.2% as trading opens on the London Stock Exchange \u2013 but all eyes are on Sainsbury\u2019s, which has lost 12%. Fellow supermarket Morrisons has fallen by 4.6%, while Tesco is down by 1.1% in spillover from the deal. The choice is stark for the merger to go ahead. There are two potential structural remedies, the CMA said. Neither will be welcomed by the companies: (a) prohibition of the Merger; or (b) requiring the divestiture to a suitable party (or parties) of assets and operations sufficient to address effectively each of the SLCs [substantial lessening of competition] identified in the provisional findings. Traders expect Sainsbury\u2019s shares to fall by between 5% and 10% when markets open at 8am GMT. Sainsbury\u2019s shares hit lows of 225.5p in March 2018, before the merger announcement, before surging to above 340p in August. While they have lost ground since then, they still remained well above the level before the deal emerged. Asda, which is currently owned by US retail giant Walmart, is not publicly traded. Here\u2019s some more detail on the CMA\u2019s findings, published this morning. The \u00a310bn merger of the UK\u2019s second and third-largest supermarkets would create a \u201csubstantial lessening of competition at both a national and local level\u201d, the CMA said. The complaints are numerous, highlighting the difficulties that the supermarkets will face if the merger is to go ahead. The CMA said the deal would harm competition: In every local market for supermarket groceries where either are present. In every local market for online grocery shopping. In 132 local markets for fuel in which both supermarkets operate petrol stations. Sainsbury\u2019s boss told the BBC the findings were \u201coutrageous\u201d and he would continue to challenge them. Chief executive Mike Coupe described the CMA\u2019s analysis as \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d and said the firm would be making \u201cvery strong representations\u201d to it about its \u201cinaccuracy and lack of objectivity\u201d. \u201cThey have fundamentally moved the goalposts, changed the shape of the ball and chosen a different playing field,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThis is totally outrageous.\u201d Despite the strong words from the CMA, the supermarkets say they will continue to fight. Here\u2019s the joint statement from Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda in full: These findings fundamentally misunderstand how people shop in the UK today and the intensity of competition in the grocery market. The CMA has moved the goalposts and its analysis is inconsistent with comparable cases. Combining Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda would create significant cost savings, which would allow us to lower prices. Despite the savings being independently reviewed by two separate industry specialists, the CMA has chosen to discount them as benefits. We are surprised that the CMA would choose to reject the opportunity to put money directly into customers\u2019 pockets, particularly at this time of economic uncertainty. We will be working to understand the rationale behind these findings and will continue to press our case in the coming weeks. The Competition and Markets Authority has on Wednesday morning dropped a bombshell in the merger talks between Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda which would create the biggest British supermarket. It is \u201clikely to be difficult for the companies to address the concerns it has identified\u201d, the CMA said. The regulator found a litany of concerns, including a worse experience in stores and online, a reduction in the choice available to consumers and higher prices at petrol stations. In a statement the CMA said: \u201cThe CMA has provisionally found extensive competition concerns as part of its in-depth investigation of the proposed merger between Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda.\u201d The regulator, led by former MP Andrew Tyrie, has laid out some limited options for the supermarkets to go forward. \u201cThe CMA has set out potential options for addressing its provisional concerns. These include blocking the deal or requiring the merging companies to sell off a significant number of stores and other assets \u2013 potentially including one of the Sainsbury\u2019s or Asda brands \u2013 to recreate the competitive rivalry lost through the merger.\u201d The agenda 8:30am GMT: Germany manufacturing purchasing managers index \u2013 February 9am GMT: Eurozone manufacturing PMI \u2013 February 9:30am: UK public sector net borrowing \u2013 January 1:30pm GMT: US durable goods orders \u2013 December",

Smith says that before Wreck This Journal, she had been a dedicated self-help reader, but grew disillusioned with attempts to fix or change herself. \u201cAt some point I felt like it wasn\u2019t doing anything,\u201d she says. \u201cI realised, \u2018I need to stop talking and thinking about these things, and I need to do them.\u2019 It\u2019s really that simple.\u201d You heard the woman. That ingratitude journal won\u2019t write itself. \u2022 The Little Book of Bad Moods by Lotta Sonninen is published in the UK by Bloomsbury at \u00a35.99.

Prep time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 45 minutes Serves: 2 1 aubergine 1 green courgette 1 yellow courgette 5 large red tomatoes 1 red onion 1 red chilli, sliced 250ml passata olive oil 50g capers 1 bay leaf 1 sprig thyme 1 sprig rosemary 1 tbsp dried oregano Method Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas mark 4. Slice the aubergine very thinly (2mm) across into rounds and reserve. Do the same with the courgettes and tomatoes, then finely slice the red onion and the red chilli. Pour the passata into a round, oven-proof cooking vessel. Add the onion, chilli and capers, then stir. Begin layering the aubergine, yellow courgette, tomato and green courgette in that order all the way around the pan. Keep the vegetables very tightly together in that order. Once the ratatouille is built, season well with salt and pepper, and drizzle over olive oil generously. Add the bay leaf, rosemary and thyme sprigs and sprinkle over the dried oregano. Place in the oven and cook for 45 minutes. Remove and allow to rest for 10 minutes before serving.

It had argued that the lease on its Canary Wharf HQ had been \u201cfrustrated\u201d by Britain\u2019s impending departure from the EU, a legal term meaning that owing to an unforeseen event, the basis on which the contract was signed had changed, making it impossible to fulfil. But landlord Canary Wharf Group took the agency to the court to enforce the contract, which lasts until 2039. Ruling on the side of the landlord, Mr Justice Smith concluded that the UK\u2019s transition to a non-EU member state did not constitute a \u201cfrustrating event\u201d. \u201cThe EMA remains obliged to perform its obligations under the lease,\u201d he said. City lawyers said the ruling would stop a wave of copycat lease cancellations from banks and other companies forced to move some or all operations to an EU member state because of Brexit. Some of EMA\u2019s 900 staff are still at Canary Wharf but the agency officially moved to Amsterdam in January. \u201cThe judge has ruled that Brexit does not amount to an event of frustration of the EMA\u2019s lease and this result will be welcome news in the property and legal market, bringing greater certainty as to the impact of Brexit on contracts,\u201d said Ben Hatton, a lawyer for Clifford Chance, which represented Canary Wharf Group. The EMA said it would take some time to study the implications of the decision. While it respected the high court ruling, it reiterated its initial claim that it had \u201cno choice\u201d but to leave London because of Brexit. Smith disagreed. He said in his judgment: \u201cThis is a case where the legal effects on the EMA of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union could have been, but were not, ameliorated by the European Union. \u201cThis failure to do so is relevant to the question of frustration and, in my judgment, renders the frustration of the lease self-induced.\u201d In his 95-page ruling, the judge said the EMA had signed up to the lease under English law and could not escape its obligations just because it was an agency of the EU. \u201cIt would seem a remarkable development for a contract involving an agency of the European Union to receive different treatment compared to a contract not involving such an agency,\u201d he said. The EMA said it believed a preliminary reference to the court of justice of the EU was still \u201cthe most appropriate way forward\u201d. Owen Talfan Davies, a partner at European law firm Fieldfisher, said the ruling was \u201cno surprise\u201d. \u201cBrexit may ultimately be the cause of some tenants being unable to comply with rental obligations under their leases, but it is not going to give rise to lawful grounds to avoid those obligations,\u201d he said. The judge confirmed that the EMA could sublet or assign the premises at 30 Churchill Place subject to the landlord\u2019s consent.",

In the city itself, the planes\u2019 cargo \u2013 boxes labelled USAid and intended for distribution by the Venezuelan opposition just across the border \u2013 are accumulating in the town\u2019s warehouses. It is an optic that matters because on the edge of a genuine humanitarian and political crisis in Venezuela, the Trump administration appears to be creating the illusion of a secondary crisis. With its air force flights, accumulation of stalled aid in the standoff with the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who is refusing to allow the aid across the border, it is a piece of highly politicised theatre with its cut-price echoes of the Berlin airlift of 1948-9 when the Soviet Union blocked transport links for supplies to Allied-controlled sectors of the city. It is a stark illustration (if one were needed) of how the US does aid in the Trump era, a period characterised by a transactional world view and a foreign policy that seems often more in service of the US president\u2019s personal standing than America\u2019s position as a global player. While US aid policy has been politicised since the post-war Marshall Plan, no US president has been so obvious and crude as Trump in their approach to using assistance for global leverage. If the Trump administration\u2019s method can actually be called doctrine \u2013 as opposed to a series of attention-seeking and ego-driven impulses \u2013 it has revealed itself in the past two years to be unconcerned with much pretence of generally accepted humanitarian principles, instead often favouring gesture politics even at the expense of wider US foreign policy interests. From the very beginning Trump has defined US development aid as entirely transactional, reiterating in the UN general assembly last year: \u201cThe United States is the world\u2019s largest giver in the world, by far, of foreign aid.

And while Trump has often threatened more than he has delivered in many other arenas, on the issue of US assistance he has a record of following through on his threats, not least against the Palestinians where he has slowed crucial aid to a trickle to force the Palestinian leadership to come to the negotiating table on his much-vaunted Middle East peace plan. That is not to say that the Trump approach to foreign assistance has not seen push-back. He was forced to retreat last year from reported plans to bypass Congress and roll back billions of dollars from the US foreign aid budget. All of this casts a harsh spotlight on the real meaning of the current accumulation of aid on Venezuela\u2019s Colombian border. The reality is that the US flights into C\u00facuta represent more than what Nathanial Myers, in a 2015 paper for the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, dubbed as a worrying and short term-ist trend towards \u201chard aid\u201d.

It is the story of a Beirut street kid who has run away from his unhappy, abusive home. He is befriended by an Ethiopian woman working as a cleaner without legal papers and gets to stay with her in return for minding her baby while she is out at work. But when she is picked up by police, he has to head off back to the streets, taking the baby with him \u2013 and is confronted by some terrible choices.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/16/nadine-labaki-interview-capernaum-film-director-actor-lebanon-oscar-nomination\">Nadine Labaki: \u2018I really believe cinema can effect social change\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I was agnostic about this movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/18/capernaum-review-cannes-film-festival\" title=\"\">when I first saw it</a>, and some of those doubts are still there on a second viewing. There is a bit of button-pushing melodrama going on and the film is flawed by Labaki\u2019s opening premise, which is silly, pointless and unconvincing. From the jail where he\u2019s ended up, the kid supposedly sues his parents for giving birth to him. This has evidently been funded as a stunt by a TV current affairs show to draw attention to child poverty, but it is an outrageous stretch to believe it would be entertained for one moment by the legal system. And that\u2019s setting aside the implausibility of this kid being allowed to make a lengthy (and free) telephone call to the TV station from prison in the first place.</p> <p>But the power and emotional force of the film mean you just have to set this flaw to one side. There\u2019s no doubt about it: the extended, improvised scenes of the boy and the baby on the streets are wonderfully performed and directed. Labaki even creates some sense memories of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0012349/\" title=\"\">Chaplin\u2019s The Kid</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/19/film-review-bicycle-theives\" title=\"\">De Sica\u2019s Bicycle Thieves</a>. There is passion and compassion here, and Labaki\u2019s film brings home what poverty and desperation mean, and conversely what love and humanity mean.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb858b9ff5469b2c3f9598f45d60689121761df5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb858b9ff5469b2c3f9598f45d60689121761df5/441_0_1942_1166/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A tough and funny tale \u2026 Capernaum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tough and funny tale \u2026 Capernaum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lifestyle pictures/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The title means \u201cChaos\u201d and also alludes to the town on the Sea of Galilee where Jesus was supposed to have taught in the synagogue and healed the sick. The parallel between Jesus\u2019s precocity and that of this film\u2019s young hero is certainly ironic. The boy is Zain (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9862858/\">Zain Al Rafeea</a>) who is infuriated by the grotesque indignity and cruelty to which his parents have submitted as a result of their poverty \u2013 and which he has to endure as well. They are making money smuggling opioid drugs into prison (where his elder brother is a convict).

      "bodyText": "Since its premiere at Cannes last May, this heart-wrenching movie from Lebanese director Nadine Labaki has won prizes and golden opinions and is a nominee for best foreign language film at this weekend\u2019s Oscars. It is the story of a Beirut street kid who has run away from his unhappy, abusive home. He is befriended by an Ethiopian woman working as a cleaner without legal papers and gets to stay with her in return for minding her baby while she is out at work. But when she is picked up by police, he has to head off back to the streets, taking the baby with him \u2013 and is confronted by some terrible choices. I was agnostic about this movie when I first saw it, and some of those doubts are still there on a second viewing. There is a bit of button-pushing melodrama going on and the film is flawed by Labaki\u2019s opening premise, which is silly, pointless and unconvincing. From the jail where he\u2019s ended up, the kid supposedly sues his parents for giving birth to him. This has evidently been funded as a stunt by a TV current affairs show to draw attention to child poverty, but it is an outrageous stretch to believe it would be entertained for one moment by the legal system. And that\u2019s setting aside the implausibility of this kid being allowed to make a lengthy (and free) telephone call to the TV station from prison in the first place. But the power and emotional force of the film mean you just have to set this flaw to one side. There\u2019s no doubt about it: the extended, improvised scenes of the boy and the baby on the streets are wonderfully performed and directed. Labaki even creates some sense memories of Chaplin\u2019s The Kid and De Sica\u2019s Bicycle Thieves. There is passion and compassion here, and Labaki\u2019s film brings home what poverty and desperation mean, and conversely what love and humanity mean. The title means \u201cChaos\u201d and also alludes to the town on the Sea of Galilee where Jesus was supposed to have taught in the synagogue and healed the sick. The parallel between Jesus\u2019s precocity and that of this film\u2019s young hero is certainly ironic. The boy is Zain (Zain Al Rafeea) who is infuriated by the grotesque indignity and cruelty to which his parents have submitted as a result of their poverty \u2013 and which he has to endure as well. They are making money smuggling opioid drugs into prison (where his elder brother is a convict). To Zain\u2019s horror, his careworn mum Souad (Kawsar Al Haddad) and dad Selim (Fadi Yousef) are getting ready to take money from their exploitative landlord in return for handing over Zain\u2019s 11-year-old sister Sahar (Cedra Izzam) to this man\u2019s son as a child bride. In a rage, Zain runs away and encounters kindly Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw) and her baby son Yonas (Boluwatife Treasure Bankole). He also encounters the sinister businessman and entrepreneur Aspro (Alaa Chouchnieh). What is so refreshing about Al Rafeea\u2019s performance is that his kid is not a passive, simpering martyr. His Zain is furious, sweary and violent. He is always angrily shoving and punching and defiantly insulting people, especially his parents. Another sort of film would imply that his anger is a character flaw that has been movingly cured by his redemptive experience looking after baby Yonas. Rather magnificently, the film insists on the opposite. Looking after Yonas has only made Zain angrier, more intimately acquainted with poverty and injustice, more aware of the awful choices into which anyone can be forced by cold and hunger. Capernaum is itself an angrier, tougher and funnier film than anything Labaki has made before, and the images of Yonas adrift with Zain in the pitiless streets are deeply affecting: visions of innocence and fragility and yet a transcendental sort of survival.

      "bodyText": "European commission investigators have raided salmon farming businesses in Scotland and other European countries in an inquiry into suspected price-fixing by Norwegian producers. The anti-cartel investigators raided sales offices owned by Mowi, formerly Marine Harvest, in Rosyth in Fife, a Scottish Sea Farms site and a salmon farm operated by Grieg in Shetland on Tuesday, as well as sites in the Netherlands and other EU member states. An industry source said the commission\u2019s investigation is focusing on allegedly restrictive trading practices in Norway, but since the country is not an EU member the commission has had to raid offices in member states as part of its information-gathering. The commission said in a letter handed yesterday to one of the raided firms that it was investigating suspected price-fixing by Norwegian producers, who controlled 84% of the farmed salmon imported into the EU in 2016. The letter stated: \u201cThe commission has received information, from different actors operating at different levels in the salmon market, alleging that some Norwegian producers of farmed Norwegian Atlantic salmon participate in or have participated [in] different ways of price coordination in order to sustain and possibly increase prices of farmed Norwegian Atlantic salmon.\u201d The commission\u2019s competition directorate said it \u201chas concerns that the inspected companies may have violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices\u201d set out in article 101 of the Lisbon treaty. Firms found to be in breach of EU competition rules can be fined up to 10% of their global turnover. The industry is in intense competition to open up new markets, particularly in China and other parts of Asia. It said officials from UK and Dutch national competition authorities took part in the raids. \u201cUnannounced inspections are a preliminary investigatory step into suspected anti-competitive practices,\u201d it added. \u201cThe fact that the commission carries out such inspections does not mean that the companies are guilty of anti-competitive behaviour nor does it prejudge the outcome of the investigation itself.\u201d Norwegian firms dominate the global salmon farming industry, with Mowi the largest of those worldwide and the largest operator in Scotland. Scottish Sea Farms, a joint venture between the Norwegian firms Salmar and Leroy Seafood, and Grieg Seafood are also majority Norwegian-owned. Ola Helge Hjetland, a spokesman for Mowi, which rebranded itself in January, told Reuters: \u201cWe have nothing to hide, we are cooperating with the European commission.\u201d Grieg issued a statement making a similar point. \u201cGrieg Seafood aims to be open, transparent and forthcoming and will provide all necessary information requested\u201d by the commission in its investigation, it said.

      "bodyText": "The commodities trader Glencore has bowed to pressure from shareholders to limit coal production for environmental reasons \u2013 days after reporting that it produced nearly 130m tonnes of the fossil fuel last year. The Switzerland-based firm, whose oil-trading operation is based in London, laid out plans to improve its environmental record, including a review of its membership of trade bodies it fears may be undermining the international Paris climate agreement. Glencore, which is Australia\u2019s biggest miner of coal, said it was responding to concern within the investment community. The Church of England, which is understood to have a stake worth just under \u00a310m in the group, welcomed the announcement. Carlota Garcia-Manas of the Church Commissioners, the C of E\u2019s \u00a38.3bn endowment fund, said: \u201cThe simple truth is that in the absence of commercially viable carbon capture and storage, coal has no long-term future in the energy mix. \u201cGlencore\u2019s commitments on capital investment and expenditure start to provide assurance to investors increasingly focused on climate-related risks and opportunities.\u201d Major Australian superannuation funds with billions of dollars under management including AustralianSuper and Cbus also put pressure on Glencore. Jeanne Martin, senior campaigns officer at ShareAction, said it was \u201ca good step forward for Glencore \u2013 the black sheep of the energy world \u2013 which for far too long refused to come out in support of the Paris agreement\u201d. However, she added: \u201cIt\u2019s actions, not words, that matter. Glencore\u2019s south-east Asian coal frenzy will be a true test of the company\u2019s commitment to the Paris goals. ShareAction will watch closely to make sure Glencore stays faithful to today\u2019s commitments.\u201d In a statement to the stock market, Glencore promised to prioritise investment in commodities that assist with the transition to cleaner energy and transport instead, while limiting coal at current production levels. An annual production report issued earlier this month showed that Glencore extracted 129.4m tonnes of coal in 2018, a 7% increase on the previous year. \u201cWe recognise climate change science as set out by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),\u201d the FTSE 100 company said. \u201cWe believe that the global response to climate change should pursue twin objectives: both limiting temperatures in line with the goals of the Paris agreement and supporting the United Nations sustainable development goals, including universal access to affordable energy.\u201d Glencore set out a plan that it said would help support the transition to a low-carbon world. The first tranche of the plan, starting in 2020, will mean the company publishing projections illustrating how it will reduce its emissions and set out how its strategy governing fossil fuel exploration and investment is affecting its efforts on climate. It also claimed to be on track to meet a target of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of its own operations by 5% by 2020 and promised to publish more stretching long-term targets next year. The plan could also result in climate change objectives being attached to executive pay schemes, while the company will review its membership in trade associations whose lobbying might \u201cundermine\u201d climate change goals. The pledge on climate change came as Glencore undershot profit forecasts for the year, reporting earnings down 41% to $3.41bn (\u00a32.6bn), largely because of impairment costs at mines in DR Congo and Zambia. The company also offered to buy back $2bn of shares from investors. Last year it launched a $1bn buyback only days after revealing it was subject to an investigation by the US Department of Justice, an announcement that sent its shares tumbling. Investigators leading Brazil\u2019s vast Car Wash investigation have also named Glencore among firms they allege are linked to bribes.",

The Conservatives cannot afford to decline into a sect which drives out all those who are unable to subscribe to whatever its stern, unbending ideology happens to be at any particular moment. It must remain a broad church within which a continuous and never finally settled argument about doctrine can take place. Only then is it able convincingly to offer its services to the nation as a party of government.</p> <p>Theresa May looks so weak because she has been attempting to hold her party together. She is not herself of a sectarian disposition: an accusation which can more justly be levelled at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/19/at-times-like-these-corbyn-is-his-own-worst-enemy\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn</a>.

It entails cajoling your discontented followers into the recognition that the best is the enemy of the good. Few Conservatives are prepared to admit quite how difficult the prime minister\u2019s task is, and many have ceased to trust a word she says. Her critics on the liberal left of the party think she has allowed herself to be pushed around too much by her party\u2019s Eurosceptics. They are deeply dissatisfied with May\u2019s handling of things, but their real quarrel is with members of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/17/brexit-may-risks-fresh-confrontation-erg-backstop\" title=\"\">European Reform Group</a>. At least three of them, we saw today, can no longer bear to stay in the same party as the ERG.</p> <p>In 1981, only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/17/margaret-thatcher-papers-tory-split\" title=\"\">one Tory MP</a>, Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler, joined the group which broke away from Labour and founded the SDP. According to Alan Clark, who watched from the Conservative benches as \u201cBrocklebank\u201d crossed \u201cin a rather stilted little display\u201d from one side of the Commons to the other, \u201cThe whole house roared with laughter, which was not the reaction intended by the Social Democrats.\u201d</p> <p>The Conservatives were in 1981 deeply divided. Many of the Tory wets believed Margaret Thatcher was leading them and the country to perdition. Yet they refrained from joining the four former Labour ministers, Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams, David Owen and Bill Rodgers, who as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/18/labour-schism-sdp-brexit-seven-mps\" title=\"\">Gang of Four</a> set up the SDP. The Conservative party held together, Thatcher led it to two more general election victories, and only at the end of 1990, by which time she had become an electoral liability, did her MPs throw her overboard.</p> <p>May already is an electoral liability, and today\u2019s defections will be harder to laugh off than Brocklebank-Fowler\u2019s was. For Brexit cuts through the party like a knife, and will go on doing so while May struggles to get her deal through the Commons. This is not just an argument about ideology. It is an argument about what the government actually does, which is why it has such divisive force.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/20/no-deal-brexit-wrecking-economy-trade\">Avoiding a no-deal crash-out won\u2019t stop Brexit wrecking our economy | Peter Mandelson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet I do not expect the Tory tribe to shatter into fragments. For the danger of making a complete mess of Brexit, and being blamed by the country for making a complete mess of Brexit, is now so acute that any deal, even whatever fudge May brings back from Brussels, is likely to seem to most Conservative MPs a better bet than the alternative. Most of them know they will never be forgiven, and their own political careers will be over if they get this wrong. Conservatives as various as Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nicky Morgan have recognised this, which is why they put their names to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/29/the-malthouse-compromise-everything-you-need-to-know-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">Malthouse compromise</a>, as a possible way forward through the Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>So the paradox of these three resignations is that in the short term they could conceivably strengthen May\u2019s position, by terrifying her MPs into obeying the great dictum attributed to that altogether more brilliant, resourceful and unscrupulous Tory leader, Benjamin Disraeli: \u201cDamn your principles! Stick to your party.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Gimson is contributing editor at ConservativeHome. He is the author of Gimson\u2019s Prime Ministers: Brief Lives from Walpole to May</p>",

      "bodyText": "If the resignation of Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen means the Tories are becoming a narrower and less tolerant party, it is a disaster. The Conservatives cannot afford to decline into a sect which drives out all those who are unable to subscribe to whatever its stern, unbending ideology happens to be at any particular moment. It must remain a broad church within which a continuous and never finally settled argument about doctrine can take place. Only then is it able convincingly to offer its services to the nation as a party of government. Theresa May looks so weak because she has been attempting to hold her party together. She is not herself of a sectarian disposition: an accusation which can more justly be levelled at Jeremy Corbyn. She is a pragmatist, who hopes she can persuade the vast majority of her backbenchers to support a pragmatic Brexit deal, even though it does not conform in every particular to the different and mutually incompatible things they would like in an ideal world to see. This is not a glorious position for a leader to be in. It entails cajoling your discontented followers into the recognition that the best is the enemy of the good. Few Conservatives are prepared to admit quite how difficult the prime minister\u2019s task is, and many have ceased to trust a word she says. Her critics on the liberal left of the party think she has allowed herself to be pushed around too much by her party\u2019s Eurosceptics. They are deeply dissatisfied with May\u2019s handling of things, but their real quarrel is with members of the European Reform Group. At least three of them, we saw today, can no longer bear to stay in the same party as the ERG. In 1981, only one Tory MP, Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler, joined the group which broke away from Labour and founded the SDP. According to Alan Clark, who watched from the Conservative benches as \u201cBrocklebank\u201d crossed \u201cin a rather stilted little display\u201d from one side of the Commons to the other, \u201cThe whole house roared with laughter, which was not the reaction intended by the Social Democrats.\u201d The Conservatives were in 1981 deeply divided. Many of the Tory wets believed Margaret Thatcher was leading them and the country to perdition. Yet they refrained from joining the four former Labour ministers, Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams, David Owen and Bill Rodgers, who as the Gang of Four set up the SDP. The Conservative party held together, Thatcher led it to two more general election victories, and only at the end of 1990, by which time she had become an electoral liability, did her MPs throw her overboard. May already is an electoral liability, and today\u2019s defections will be harder to laugh off than Brocklebank-Fowler\u2019s was. For Brexit cuts through the party like a knife, and will go on doing so while May struggles to get her deal through the Commons. This is not just an argument about ideology. It is an argument about what the government actually does, which is why it has such divisive force. And yet I do not expect the Tory tribe to shatter into fragments. For the danger of making a complete mess of Brexit, and being blamed by the country for making a complete mess of Brexit, is now so acute that any deal, even whatever fudge May brings back from Brussels, is likely to seem to most Conservative MPs a better bet than the alternative. Most of them know they will never be forgiven, and their own political careers will be over if they get this wrong. Conservatives as various as Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nicky Morgan have recognised this, which is why they put their names to the Malthouse compromise, as a possible way forward through the Brexit negotiations. So the paradox of these three resignations is that in the short term they could conceivably strengthen May\u2019s position, by terrifying her MPs into obeying the great dictum attributed to that altogether more brilliant, resourceful and unscrupulous Tory leader, Benjamin Disraeli: \u201cDamn your principles! Stick to your party.\u201d \u2022 Andrew Gimson is contributing editor at ConservativeHome. He is the author of Gimson\u2019s Prime Ministers: Brief Lives from Walpole to May",

      "bodyText": "Harvey Weinstein, the movie producer who was arrested on charges of rape last May and is currently on bail, has issued a rare statement rebuffing a detail in a lengthy profile of Gwyneth Paltrow. In the Variety interview, Paltrow recalls working with Weinstein over the years, including on the multi-Oscar-winning Shakespeare in Love, which triumphed at the Academy Awards 20 years ago. Just before shooting began, Paltrow says, \u201cHarvey wanted Ben Affleck to take over and play Shakespeare. I said, \u2018No, you can\u2019t do that. You have to have an English person.\u2019\u201d The magazine says both the film\u2019s director, John Madden, and producer, Donna Gigliotti, had confirmed to them that Weinstein suggested Affleck for the role which went to Joseph Fiennes. Affleck, meanwhile, joined the cast as actor Ned Alleyn. On Tuesday, Weinstein denied this was the case. \u201cGwyneth Paltrow is an excellent actor and a fantastic person, who does so well when on the right project,\u201d he said in a statement via his publicist. \u201cThe only other contenders for the role of Will Shakespeare were Russell Crowe and Ethan Hawke, no one else. Ben Affleck did a terrific job as Ned Alleyn, which is the role he was considered for.\u201d In the interview, Paltrow further detailed the alleged incident that led her to join dozens of other women in accusing Weinstein of sexual misconduct in a 2017 New York Times article. \u201cI had one really uncomfortable, weird experience; then he was never inappropriate with me again in that way,\u201d she said, referring to an incident in 1996, when they were working on Emma. Paltrow says that Weinstein summoned her to his hotel room, put his hands on her and asked her for a massage. When she told her then-boyfriend, Brad Pitt, what had occurred, he threatened to kill the producer. Paltrow explains that after that incident, she felt emboldened to speak up her dealings with a man she calls \u201ca very difficult boss\u201d. This paid dividends when she suspected his company may have withheld profits from her following the success of Emma. \u201cI got him to pay me something. I remember I got this legal letter that said, \u2018This is not an acknowledgment that we owe you this money, but here\u2019s a cheque,\u2019\u201d she recalled. Variety also shared a note sent by Juda Engelmayer, Weinstein\u2019s current representative, which prefaced the statement about Affleck and took issue with their reporting in general. \u201cJust to ask \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t you ask us anything here,\u201d it read. \u201cWhen will the media \u2026 shit about Harvey fade out and when will actual reporting and investigating become something revered again? When Paltrow says, \u2018A movie is not going to be successful if it\u2019s not a good movie, not like that,\u2019 you take it as gospel, but when someone accuses Harvey of shenanigans the same sentiment is ignored in place of something more sinister, why is that? \u201cJust as a good movie is a good movie, if someone is a good actor, you can\u2019t keep her or him down. If someone is a box office draw, a good agency and good actor will get chosen for a role \u2013 blacklisting someone is just a bullshit idea convenient to beat the drum against Weinstein with.\u201d Weinstein faces trial over the alleged assault of two women. He denies all accusations of non-consensual sex.",

      "body": "<p>Tom Bower specialises in men with something to hide. He made his name as a biographer by doggedly digging up dirt on the sort of rich, powerful figures who excel at keeping it buried, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/gallery/2009/jul/22/tom-bower\" title=\"\">Robert Maxwell</a>. But in <em>Dangerous Hero</em>, he is attempting something slightly different. For all the author\u2019s dark inferences that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> is hiding things that voters deserve to know, the striking thing about the Labour leader is what is out there in plain sight.</p> <p>Once again this week Corbyn\u2019s record and character have come under a harsh spotlight. He stands accused by a group of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/19/joan-ryan-eighth-labour-mp-quits-party-to-join-breakaway-independent-group\" title=\"\">now former Labour MPs</a> of leading an institutionally antisemitic party, fiddling while Brexit burns and jeopardising national security in his eagerness to accommodate almost any enemy of America.</p> <p>Readers may disagree with the breakaway MPs\u2019 conclusions, but can hardly be surprised by the charge sheet. We all know by now about the meetings with Holocaust deniers and perpetrators of blood libel, the somersaults turned to avoid blaming the Kremlin for the Salisbury poisonings, the long history of antipathy to the EU. (Corbyn\u2019s former constituency agent Keith Veness tells Bower that he suspects the Labour leader secretly voted to leave, judging by his apparent pleasure at the referendum result, although this has been repeatedly denied.) It\u2019s not that he really made a secret of any of this, but that for decades he was such an insignificant a figure in British politics that it hardly seemed to matter. And now he is so very significant that his supporters can\u2019t afford to let it matter, if they want their one shot at a true socialist government.</p> <p>The book opens with a vignette that in some ways illustrates what Bower is up against in trying, as he evidently is, to convince readers that the Labour leader is unfit for office. The author writes that as a backbench MP Corbyn got so deep in personal debt, following an ill-advised promise to personally underwrite the costs of opening an office in his constituency, that his then wife Claudia was struggling to feed and clothe their three sons. After an awkward meeting with the veteran leftwinger Reg Race, summoned by his wife as a neutral observer, Corbyn agreed to sell the family home. But his friendship with Race, the bearer of bad news, did not survive and neither ultimately did the marriage. (Although officially he and Claudia divorced because she wanted to send their son to a grammar school and Corbyn didn\u2019t approve, Bower argues this was merely a cover story and his first two wives both felt emotionally and practically neglected.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>So what if he eats baked beans cold from a tin or isn\u2019t much fun on holiday? Can\u2019t a man have his mind on higher things?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The anecdote is clearly intended to be telling on multiple levels; here is a man aspiring to run the nation\u2019s finances who seemingly can\u2019t even manage his own, sulks when confronted with mistakes and fosters myths about his private life that make him look noble. Yet readers sympathetic to Corbyn could clearly interpret it as evidence of a man so principled that he would rather sacrifice his home and marriage than break an election promise. As for the hair-shirt tendencies Bower also describes, so what if he eats baked beans cold from a tin or isn\u2019t much fun on holiday? Can\u2019t a man have his mind on higher things?</p> <p>Other charges, however, are harder to dismiss. Perhaps the most telling criticism is that Corbyn is simply not very bright, or certainly not as bright as leaders are traditionally expected to be. A teacher\u2019s son, educated at a fee-paying grammar, he nonetheless scraped only two Es at A-level before dropping out of a course in trade union studies at North London Polytechnic because the academic work (at least in Bower\u2019s telling) was beyond him.</p> <p>\u201cHe came to loathe high achievers, especially undergraduates with ambition to get to the top \u2026 most of all he hated the rich and successful and identified with losers,\u201d Bower writes. His first wife, Jane Chapman, says Corbyn never read a book in four years of marriage and there are repeated accounts of him reading from scripts in meetings in the manner of someone who simply can\u2019t think on his feet. His backbench career was long on expressing passionate solidarity with causes but short on concrete achievements, and he comes across as prone to ducking arguments that he lacks the skill to win.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/30/jeremy-corbyns-views-could-drive-jewish-people-from-uk-leader\" title=\"\">Jonathan Arkush</a>, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, left one critical meeting on antisemitism concluding that the Labour leader was either emotionally or intellectually incapable of even grasping the complaint: \u201cHe did not engage, either to agree or disagree. He looked as if he was shrinking into a shell from which he did not want to come out.\u201d Bower even ascribes the antisemitism <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/01/labour-leadership-urged-to-adequately-tackle-antisemitism\" title=\"\">scandal now tearing Labour apart</a> in part to an inability to understand that not everything is about class struggle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c57e33c32bbd2e64398f94b5f2091209d07b4851\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c57e33c32bbd2e64398f94b5f2091209d07b4851/0_61_2917_3644/800.jpg\" alt=\"Corbyn, speaking at a rally in Camden in the 1980s.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corbyn, speaking at a rally in Camden in the eighties.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Jones/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The other wounding charge here for someone who prides himself on authenticity is the suggestion that Corbyn romanticises his own history. It\u2019s mostly pretty minor stuff, like claiming as a young man to come from \u201cTelford new town\u201d rather than posh rural Shropshire. More seriously, however, Bower questions whether his parents were ever at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1936/oct/05/fromthearchive\" title=\"\">Cable Street</a>, the infamous 1936 clash between fascists and East End socialists, as Corbyn has repeatedly claimed whenever he wants to argue that his anti-racist credentials run deep. (Presumably the author\u2019s lawyers have been over all over this allegation like a rash, but it would have helped the reader to have some hard evidence on this point.)</p> <p>More than once, Corbyn or his office are caught suggesting that he doesn\u2019t know or can\u2019t remember people with whom it later emerges he shared platforms. Is that simply an understandable failure to recall every name from the thousands of people he must have met over a long parliamentary career, or something worse? Bower isn\u2019t inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt.</p> <p>And that\u2019s perhaps the biggest flaw in an otherwise damning book. Bower\u2019s colours seem nailed to the mast, for all that he was once a student Marxist himself, and particularly towards the end there are times when his criticisms feel like something of a stretch. Even if it is true that his handling of last year\u2019s failed vote of confidence in Theresa May left John McDonnell \u201cfuming, wondering whether Corbyn wanted to be prime minister at all\u201d, it seems unrealistic to think Corbyn could have persuaded Tory MPs to trigger an election they might lose simply by sounding more emollient. Nor does Bower spend enough time analysing the popularity of his economic beliefs, or why he succeeded where bigger characters on the hard left failed in taking over the party and almost winning an election.</p> <p>His description of Corbyn\u2019s early years as an activist and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/12/haringey-council-taken-over-momentum-locals-taking-back-control\" title=\"\">councillor in Haringey</a>, where he came across in public as quiet and unconfrontational while (in the words of one fellow councillor) turning \u201cevery meeting of the Labour group into a terrible argument\u201d rings depressingly true today. But there remains an unresolved tension in the book between talk of \u201cruthless plots for power\u201d and the portrayal of Corbyn as an accidental leader, who seriously considered retiring to rural Wiltshire to keep bees only two years before stumbling somehow to the top.</p> <p>This is the most compelling in-depth study so far of a man whose head is unusually difficult to get inside, given his suspicion of anyone who isn\u2019t a fellow traveller.

      "bodyText": "Tom Bower specialises in men with something to hide. He made his name as a biographer by doggedly digging up dirt on the sort of rich, powerful figures who excel at keeping it buried, such as Robert Maxwell. But in Dangerous Hero, he is attempting something slightly different. For all the author\u2019s dark inferences that Jeremy Corbyn is hiding things that voters deserve to know, the striking thing about the Labour leader is what is out there in plain sight. Once again this week Corbyn\u2019s record and character have come under a harsh spotlight. He stands accused by a group of now former Labour MPs of leading an institutionally antisemitic party, fiddling while Brexit burns and jeopardising national security in his eagerness to accommodate almost any enemy of America. Readers may disagree with the breakaway MPs\u2019 conclusions, but can hardly be surprised by the charge sheet. We all know by now about the meetings with Holocaust deniers and perpetrators of blood libel, the somersaults turned to avoid blaming the Kremlin for the Salisbury poisonings, the long history of antipathy to the EU. (Corbyn\u2019s former constituency agent Keith Veness tells Bower that he suspects the Labour leader secretly voted to leave, judging by his apparent pleasure at the referendum result, although this has been repeatedly denied.) It\u2019s not that he really made a secret of any of this, but that for decades he was such an insignificant a figure in British politics that it hardly seemed to matter. And now he is so very significant that his supporters can\u2019t afford to let it matter, if they want their one shot at a true socialist government. The book opens with a vignette that in some ways illustrates what Bower is up against in trying, as he evidently is, to convince readers that the Labour leader is unfit for office. The author writes that as a backbench MP Corbyn got so deep in personal debt, following an ill-advised promise to personally underwrite the costs of opening an office in his constituency, that his then wife Claudia was struggling to feed and clothe their three sons. After an awkward meeting with the veteran leftwinger Reg Race, summoned by his wife as a neutral observer, Corbyn agreed to sell the family home. But his friendship with Race, the bearer of bad news, did not survive and neither ultimately did the marriage. (Although officially he and Claudia divorced because she wanted to send their son to a grammar school and Corbyn didn\u2019t approve, Bower argues this was merely a cover story and his first two wives both felt emotionally and practically neglected.) The anecdote is clearly intended to be telling on multiple levels; here is a man aspiring to run the nation\u2019s finances who seemingly can\u2019t even manage his own, sulks when confronted with mistakes and fosters myths about his private life that make him look noble. Yet readers sympathetic to Corbyn could clearly interpret it as evidence of a man so principled that he would rather sacrifice his home and marriage than break an election promise. As for the hair-shirt tendencies Bower also describes, so what if he eats baked beans cold from a tin or isn\u2019t much fun on holiday? Can\u2019t a man have his mind on higher things? Other charges, however, are harder to dismiss. Perhaps the most telling criticism is that Corbyn is simply not very bright, or certainly not as bright as leaders are traditionally expected to be. A teacher\u2019s son, educated at a fee-paying grammar, he nonetheless scraped only two Es at A-level before dropping out of a course in trade union studies at North London Polytechnic because the academic work (at least in Bower\u2019s telling) was beyond him. \u201cHe came to loathe high achievers, especially undergraduates with ambition to get to the top \u2026 most of all he hated the rich and successful and identified with losers,\u201d Bower writes. His first wife, Jane Chapman, says Corbyn never read a book in four years of marriage and there are repeated accounts of him reading from scripts in meetings in the manner of someone who simply can\u2019t think on his feet. His backbench career was long on expressing passionate solidarity with causes but short on concrete achievements, and he comes across as prone to ducking arguments that he lacks the skill to win. Jonathan Arkush, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, left one critical meeting on antisemitism concluding that the Labour leader was either emotionally or intellectually incapable of even grasping the complaint: \u201cHe did not engage, either to agree or disagree. He looked as if he was shrinking into a shell from which he did not want to come out.\u201d Bower even ascribes the antisemitism scandal now tearing Labour apart in part to an inability to understand that not everything is about class struggle. The other wounding charge here for someone who prides himself on authenticity is the suggestion that Corbyn romanticises his own history. It\u2019s mostly pretty minor stuff, like claiming as a young man to come from \u201cTelford new town\u201d rather than posh rural Shropshire. More seriously, however, Bower questions whether his parents were ever at Cable Street, the infamous 1936 clash between fascists and East End socialists, as Corbyn has repeatedly claimed whenever he wants to argue that his anti-racist credentials run deep. (Presumably the author\u2019s lawyers have been over all over this allegation like a rash, but it would have helped the reader to have some hard evidence on this point.) More than once, Corbyn or his office are caught suggesting that he doesn\u2019t know or can\u2019t remember people with whom it later emerges he shared platforms. Is that simply an understandable failure to recall every name from the thousands of people he must have met over a long parliamentary career, or something worse? Bower isn\u2019t inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt. And that\u2019s perhaps the biggest flaw in an otherwise damning book. Bower\u2019s colours seem nailed to the mast, for all that he was once a student Marxist himself, and particularly towards the end there are times when his criticisms feel like something of a stretch. Even if it is true that his handling of last year\u2019s failed vote of confidence in Theresa May left John McDonnell \u201cfuming, wondering whether Corbyn wanted to be prime minister at all\u201d, it seems unrealistic to think Corbyn could have persuaded Tory MPs to trigger an election they might lose simply by sounding more emollient. Nor does Bower spend enough time analysing the popularity of his economic beliefs, or why he succeeded where bigger characters on the hard left failed in taking over the party and almost winning an election. His description of Corbyn\u2019s early years as an activist and councillor in Haringey, where he came across in public as quiet and unconfrontational while (in the words of one fellow councillor) turning \u201cevery meeting of the Labour group into a terrible argument\u201d rings depressingly true today. But there remains an unresolved tension in the book between talk of \u201cruthless plots for power\u201d and the portrayal of Corbyn as an accidental leader, who seriously considered retiring to rural Wiltshire to keep bees only two years before stumbling somehow to the top. This is the most compelling in-depth study so far of a man whose head is unusually difficult to get inside, given his suspicion of anyone who isn\u2019t a fellow traveller. Just don\u2019t expect it to change anyone\u2019s mind. \u2022 Dangerous Hero: Corbyn\u2019s Ruthless Plot for Power is published by William Collins (\u00a320).

A club hero who scored 72 times in three spells at Gigg Lane, spearheading their last two promotion campaigns, Lowe was dragooned into the manager\u2019s chair twice last season, his two caretaker spells sandwiching Chris Lucketti\u2019s calamitous 10 games in charge.</p> <p>Lowe could not stop relegation but, having been given the job on a permanent basis, decided in the summer to do things his own way. And his own way is frantic, attacking, cavalier football. \u201cBecause I was a striker,\u201d Lowe says, when asked why he chooses to play this way. \u201cI loved scoring goals, wherever it was: whether it was on the pitch or in the back garden with my little lad. My assistant Steven Schumacher was a goalscoring midfielder. We loved playing an attacking style and most of the successful teams I played in had an attacking style.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee5fcdc6ae1af00956624d625ce8de79e8dc71cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee5fcdc6ae1af00956624d625ce8de79e8dc71cc/417_40_2384_1430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bury\u2019s attacking football has received plenty of praise thanks to the work of striker Nicky Maynard, left, and Jay O\u2019Shea, right.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bury\u2019s attacking football has received plenty of praise thanks to the work of striker Nicky Maynard, left, and Jay O\u2019Shea, right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Burstow/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If that seems a bit risky for his first job at a League Two club \u2013 after all, it is one thing to try something like this with Premier League resources but another in the bottom tier of the Football League \u2013 Lowe says: \u201cI\u2019ve said a lot of times, \u2018Why can\u2019t Bury play like Liverpool or Manchester City?\u2019 I think it\u2019s the best way.

Lead prosecutors for the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) questioned Marcus Agius over his knowledge of a key document from 31 October that year, detailing the payment terms of an advisory services agreement that would result in the bank paying \u00a3280m to the Qataris. \u201cAbsolutely not \u2026 I saw this document for the first time some years afterward,\u201d Agius told a jury at Southwark crown court on Wednesday. \u201cNot only did I not see this document, I was not aware of its existence.\u201d The SFO\u2019s lead prosecutor, Edward Brown QC, went on to ask whether the former chairman was aware of how it was negotiated or how the figure was arrived at. To both questions, Agius answered \u201cno\u201d. The SFO alleges four former Barclays executives \u2013 Richard Boath, John Varley, Roger Jenkins and Tom Kalaris \u2013 lied to the stock market and other investors about how \u00a3322m in fees were paid to Qatar in relation to emergency fundraising of more than \u00a311bn in 2008. Prosecutors say the executives put together two advisory services agreements in order to disguise Qatar\u2019s demand for larger commission payments. All four men have denied the charges. Prosecutors have not accused Agius of wrongdoing. On Tuesday, the former chairman was asked what his reaction would have been if he was told of additional fees paid during the fundraising. Agius said he would want to understand why they were necessary, as it would have been an \u201cexceptional move\u201d and that everyone should be \u201cpaid the same\u201d. He added that fees for one set of underwriters and not another \u201cwould be completely contrary to market practice\u201d and \u201cundermine the entire project\u201d. On Wednesday, Agius told the court tthere was some disappointment over how surprised the market was that Barclays was pursuing a second round of emergency funding as the financial crisis reached a peak in October 2008. He said it was disappointing to see the share price reaction, \u201cdespite the fact that market testing\u201d showed support for financing. \u201cIt\u2019s also true to say that the absence of the ability of small shareholders to take up pre-emptive rights was the subject of some disappointment,\u201d he added. After Agius completed his witness testimony on Wednesday morning , the prosecution presented further documents and emails spanning the period into late 2010. The jury was read an an email sent in January 2010 by Peter Estlin, who served as the group\u2019s financial controller for two years from 2008. The message he sent to a member of the Barclays finance department relayed questions from the auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers about the Qatari advisory services agreement. Estlin said: \u201c[PwC] were eager to understand that there is real activity supporting the payments, even if they are expensive.\u201d He added that there was a need to \u201cunderstand the meeting, introductions, etc that they assisted with\u201d.

      "bodyText": "British tourists travelling to continental Europe may need to pay \u00a352 for a visa in a few weeks after Spanish demands over the status of Gibraltar again derailed Brussels\u2019 preparations for Brexit. Agreement on legislation exempting UK nationals from requiring the travel permit is mired in a dispute over whether the British overseas territory should be described as a \u201ccolony\u201d in the EU\u2019s statute book. Spain has insisted, with the reluctant support of the other 26 member states, that a footnote containing the contentious description of the disputed territory is added to the legislation. But on Wednesday morning the European parliament rejected the language proposed by the council of the European Union, the body that represents the member states. It is the third time the member states\u2019 proposal has been sent back by MEPs and casts doubt over whether the legislation can be salvaged in the next few weeks. Petr Je\u017eek, a Czech MEP, said the council was \u201cplaying with fire\u201d with just weeks to go before the UK leaves the EU. \u201cThe negotiation is stuck,\u201d he said. \u201cBrexit will hurt immensely and we should do everything possible to soften the impact rather than create further problems for half a billion people. If there is no agreement, and no visa exemption for the UK, the British government may adopt a similar approach \u2013 and that would be a disaster.\u201d Je\u017eek said the European parliament\u2019s position had been adopted unanimously and that MEPs could not accept \u201ccolonial language which has no place in the world\u201d. The parliament is suggesting the footnote could be reduced to merely stating that there is a \u201ccontroversy between Spain and the United Kingdom concerning the sovereignty of Gibraltar\u201d. But Je\u017eek warned there did not appear to be any sign that the council was willing to compromise. \u201cIt is quite stubborn.\u201d The legislation being discussed by the EU institutions would put the UK on a visa-exemption list from 29 March, when the country formally leaves the bloc. Until 2021, there would be no need for a visa even if the UK left the EU without a deal. After that, UK nationals would need to pay \u20ac7 for three years\u2019 visa-free travel under a new European travel information and authorisation system, which is being introduced for all non-EU states. But if the impasse is not broken and the UK crashes out on 29 March, British tourists will be left in legal limbo as the UK will be neither on the list of countries where a visa is required or among those with an exemption. MEPs fear that British nationals seeking to stay in an EU country for fewer than 90 days could ultimately be required to pay \u20ac60 (\u00a352) for a Schengen visa or be left waiting for the completion of bilateral deals before being allowed to travel. Should the Commons finally ratify the prime minister\u2019s withdrawal agreement, UK nationals would continue to be treated as EU citizens during a 21-month transition period, providing more time for a solution on the visa exemption to be found. UK government sources said they were confident that the legislation would go through and that British nationals would not be required to pay for a Schengen visa. The row over the description of Gibraltar, over which Madrid has been in dispute with Britain for three centuries, erupted again last month when Spain made its demand for a footnote. Madrid initially wanted all the EU\u2019s no-deal legislation \u2013 drafted in case the UK leaves without ratifying the withdrawal agreement \u2013 to note that Gibraltar was disputed and on a UN list of \u201cnon-self-governing territories \u2026 subject to decolonisation\u201d. That move was blocked by France, as French Polynesia and New Caledonia are also on that list. The compromise note on the visa legislation proposed by ambassadors instead says: \u201cGibraltar is a colony of the British crown.\u201d Claude Moraes, the Labour MEP acting as the rapporteur representing the European parliament in the negotiations with the council, said the use of the word \u201ccolony\u201d was \u201ccompletely unnecessary legally or politically for this legislation to be enacted\u201d. \u201cThe addition is a political act. And my strategy is to work in a focused way to get a compromise wording to allow visa-free travel to become a reality, but I will never back down on the colony wording, which is unacceptable. \u201cHaving looked in depth to this legislation there is a clear understanding now of the wider economic and personal impact of this visa situation if this does not pass. It will affect the lives of potentially millions of people in their business and family arrangements.\u201d The British ambassador in Brussels, Sir Tim Barrow, has already formally tabled his opposition to that description.

Now it was a national sensation and even the choosiest stars wanted to get on board.

Just two years earlier, the impresario\u2019s show Soul Train had been a Chicago thing, broadcasting local talent to local viewers. Now it was a national sensation and even the choosiest stars wanted to get on board. Franklin told him: \u201cMy kids love the show and I want to be a part of it.\u201d Stevie Wonder improvised an ode to Soul Train. James Brown, convinced that somebody, probably a white somebody, must be behind such a slick operation, looked around its Los Angeles studio and kept asking Cornelius: \u201cBrother, who\u2019s backing you on this?\u201d Each time Cornelius replied: \u201cWell, James, it\u2019s just me.\u201d He wasn\u2019t bragging.

On American Soul, we\u2019re going to unpack the man who created all of that.\u201d Cornelius was born in 1936 in Bronzeville, Chicago.

When Martin Luther King or Jesse Jackson came to town, Cornelius was there.

At the time, black actors were largely confined to stereotypical supporting roles while black musicians were underrepresented on Dick Clark\u2019s American Bandstand. So young black people saw themselves most often on the nightly news, and rarely in a flattering light. \u201cIn the first episode of American Soul, Cornelius says, \u2018I want black folks to be seen how black folks should be seen: strong, powerful and beautiful,\u2019\u201d says Walls. \u201cDon had to butt heads with everybody: the buyers, the advertisers, people who wanted to invest in the show for ulterior motives. His challenges were daily.\u201d Taking the name from the live gigs he promoted in Chicago, Cornelius pitched Soul Train as \u201cthe American Bandstand of colour\u201d. Debuting on WCIU on 17 August 1970 with performances by Jerry Butler, the Chi-Lites and the Emotions, it began as a low-budget affair, filmed in black and white. It was an instant hit with black viewers, Cornelius said, \u201cnot because it was a wonderful show but because it was theirs\u201d. To fulfil its potential, Soul Train needed national syndication, which required sponsorship. Snubbed by most brands, Cornelius secured the vital support of Johnson Products, the Chicago-based manufacturer of the black haircare range Afro Sheen. Cornelius also needed a big name for the first Los Angeles show on 2 October 1971, and beseeched Motown star Gladys Knight (played by Kelly Rowland in American Soul) to step up.

Black culture was communicating blackness to black people and everybody else was just there to look over our shoulders while we had this love festival amongst ourselves.\u201d As host, Cornelius emanated a distinctly Chicago brand of cool: smooth, drily witty, somewhat strait-laced despite his flashy threads. Even his hair had gravitas. \u201cDon had one of the best afros of his generation,\u201d marvels Tate. \u201cIt was like having a Black Power salute coming out of your head!\u201d Feeling a civic responsibility to emphasise the positive, Cornelius ran a tight ship. The dancers were told: \u201cBe on time, be tactful, be creative, be funky, be yourself.\u201d Cursing, chewing gum and negativity were verboten. Unpaid and overworked (a month\u2019s worth of episodes was filmed over a single weekend), dancers still queued in their thousands to audition, hoping to become mini-celebrities who taught the nation how to do the Robot, the Hustle and the Bus Stop.

Jesse Jackson, Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder all spoke at his funeral but one friend told the New York Times that Cornelius was a difficult man to get to know: \u201cYou could fit all of Don\u2019s friends in a phone booth and still have room.\u201d Tony now runs the Don Cornelius Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to mental health and suicide prevention. One of the tasks of American Soul is to illuminate the personality of an intense, private man who had private struggles behind his suave persona. Tate calls Cornelius \u201cthe Berry Gordy of television\u201d: a businessman whose celebrity was a means to an end. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t interested in himself being the brand; he was interested in owning the brand.\u201d I ask Tony whether his father would have enjoyed seeing DC, as well as Don Cornelius, portrayed on screen. \u201cProbably not!\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cBut it\u2019s like medicine. You may not like the way it tastes but it\u2019s good for you.\u201d American Soul is on Thursday nights at 10pm on BET.",

It is likely it will be crushed by first past the post. But damn the Campaign group and damn the ERG. Leave them to their takeovers of the old parties. Let us have reason back. GillianJones1",

Her sp\u00e4tzle are indeed deliciously soft, so if you can find 00, give them a try, though you\u2019ll still get decent results with ordinary plain flour.</p> <p>I\u2019m intrigued by the recipe in <a href=\"http://www.4thestate.co.uk/2018/09/little-potato-dumplings-with-spinach-cream-from-anja-dunk/\" title=\"\">Anja Dunk\u2019s Strudel, Noodles &amp; Dumplings</a>, which uses equal quantities of plain flour and finely ground semolina \u2013 a harder durum wheat flour that gives the noodles a springy, slightly coarse consistency I rather like \u2013 though some testers find them a bit chewy in comparison with the all-flour versions.</p> <p>Helpfully, German-based food and travel writer Christie Dietz (whose blog, <a href=\"http://www.asausagehastwo.com/favourite-german-meals-2018/\" title=\"\">A Sausage Has Two</a>, is mouthwatering proof that German cooking is more than just beer and bratwurst) tells me that her sister-in-law, who lives in \u201cprime sp\u00e4tzle-making territory\u201d uses a \u201ccoarse-grained flour called Dunst, an \u2018intermediate product\u2019 of wheat and flour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fbe8dafce2aa43a61ddb4abe4f812a97456e2a56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbe8dafce2aa43a61ddb4abe4f812a97456e2a56/0_752_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Slater\u2019s spatzle, baked with double cream, bacon and cheese.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Slater\u2019s sp\u00e4tzle, baked with double cream, bacon and cheese, are his take on traditional Swabian k\u00e4ssp\u00e4tzle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The grain size is between flour and semolina, which means it makes a dough that\u2019s stronger and absorbs more water. Its special features [according to the manufacturer\u2019s website] are that it makes Sp\u00e4tzle robust and a nice yellow colour.\u201d However, Dietz adds, \u201ca mix of semolina and normal white wheat flour [German type 405] can also be used.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do, though in deference to those who prefer a softer sp\u00e4tzle, my recipe will contain just enough semolina to give them a slight bounciness, rather than Dunk\u2019s more robustly textured versions, and a good pinch of McFadden and Saveur magazine\u2019s nutmeg to add a subtle warmth.</p> <h2>Liquid</h2> <p>Sp\u00e4tzle always contain eggs for both colour and flavour, but generally loosened with a less viscous liquid, be that oil, as in chef <a href=\"https://uk.phaidon.com/agenda/food/articles/2018/august/23/theres-more-to-german-cuisine-than-currywurst/\" title=\"\">Alfons Schuhbeck\u2019s The German Cookbook</a>; milk, as in McFadden\u2019s recipe; water, as Dietz recommends; or the sparkling water used by Steffi, who says it \u201cmakes the dough a little bit lighter\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.saveur.com/consent.php?redirect=https%3a%2f%2fwww.saveur.com%2fgermanys-favorite-comfort-food#page-2\" title=\"\">Saveur\u2019s version</a>, based on that served at Munich\u2019s staunchly traditional Spatenhaus an der Oper, uses eggs alone, whisked to a froth \u2013 \u201cthe secret to delicate, tender dumplings\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cf15b278c8987f0885c83013bf7448a5b4ad66a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf15b278c8987f0885c83013bf7448a5b4ad66a0/574_0_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saveur magazine\u2019s spatzle dough uses sparkling water making it a bit lighter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saveur magazine\u2019s sp\u00e4tzle dough uses sparkling water, making it a bit lighter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Milk makes for the softest, squidgiest sp\u00e4tzle, while upping the egg content makes the dough more chewy. It\u2019s a matter of preference, really, but on the basis that most of us prefer a less dense noodle, largely because we can eat more of them, I\u2019m going to whisk the bejesus out of the eggs, and use sparkling water, too.</p> <p>The most important point, according to multiple sources, is to get as much air into the batter as possible, so even if you use milk or tap water, you should, as Dietz puts it, \u201cbeat the dough with a wooden spoon till it bubbles\u201d \u2013 a fact confirmed by Manfred Grossmann, Spatenhaus an der Oper\u2019s chef, who tells Saveur that \u201cthe trick to tender sp\u00e4tzle is whisking the batter vigorously until it\u2019s smooth and frothy with air bubbles\u201d. This requires some serious elbow grease with such a thick batter, but on the plus side, it shouldn\u2019t take long and, if you prefer, you could always use a food mixer to do the hard work.</p> <h2>The shaping</h2> <p>As Steffi explained to Nigel Slater when he called on her sp\u00e4tzle expertise for his <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05y38pk\" title=\"\">BBC television series Eating Together</a>, \u201cperhaps the most remarkable aspect\u201d of the whole process is \u201cthe way in which sp\u00e4tzle are made, as the individual noodles are \u201cscraped off a board, straight into boiling water\u201d using a metal dough scraper. \u201cI have seen people make sp\u00e4tzle using a knife, and any thin board with a handle,\u201d she concedes. \u201cAll you need is some fine motoric skills, some upper-body strength and determination.\u201d But, when Slater tells you \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of technique to making sp\u00e4tzle\u201d, you sense that it\u2019s not quite as easy as she makes out.</p> <p>Specialist <em>sp\u00e4tzleschwob</em> dough presses are cheap and easily available in Germany and online, but unless you develop a real passion for the stuff, which is not beyond the bounds of possibility, you get fairly similar, if rather stubbier results (strictly speaking, kn\u00f6pfle, or little buttons) by pushing a slightly looser dough through a colander or coarse grater instead, and McFadden swears by her Chinese skimmer. (Some suggest potato ricers also work, but this experiment proves a complete disaster and I can\u2019t in all conscience recommend it.)</p> <p>However, as <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/2011/03/spaetzle/\" title=\"\">Deb Perelman of the Smitten Kitchen blog</a> puts it, \u201cI quickly found pressing a thick colander of batter over a boiling pot of water very unpleasant. And hot. And awkward.\u201d And unless you hold it well away from the heat, the batter has a tendency to weld itself to the metal in the process. Oddly, I found the traditional method far easier, even if some of my sp\u00e4tzle are less \u201clittle sparrows\u201d, as the name suggests, and more Christmas turkeys. Practice makes perfect.</p> <p>Rinsing them under cold water to stop them cooking further, and indeed sticking together, is a good idea \u2013 if you want to make them in advance, but serve them plain, you can put them in a heatproof bowl with a sprinkle of water and and store in a low oven rather than saut\u00e9ing them as in the recipe below.</p> <h2>Serving suggestions</h2> <p>As Steffi notes, sp\u00e4tzle, like chips, go with everything \u2013 \u201cespecially with meats that come with a bit of sauce, such as casserole dishes, but on children\u2019s menus, you\u2019ll often find them served with nothing but a spoonful of light gravy\u201d; McFadden, meanwhile, recommends them as a side to her venison casserole.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2bb9949b629a52bfdc61361316f5686bfae88109\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bb9949b629a52bfdc61361316f5686bfae88109/893_0_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anja Dunk\u2019s spatzle with chard, sour cream and smoked cheese.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anja Dunk\u2019s sp\u00e4tzle with chard, sour cream and smoked cheese.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I try them with a variety of dishes: tossed with smoked bacon and sauerkraut, as in The German Cookbook, baked with chard, sour cream and smoked cheese, as Dunk suggests, and baked with double cream, bacon and cheese in <a href=\"http://gingerandbread.com/2015/07/10/nigel-slaters-spatzle-and-cheese/\" title=\"\">Nigel Slater\u2019s take on the traditional Swabian k\u00e4ssp\u00e4tzle</a>. All are delicious \u2013 how could they not be? \u2013 but my favourite is the simple cheese and onion k\u00e4sssp\u00e4tzle recipe Saveur adapts from that served by Grossman in Munich, gooey with molten emmental.</p> <p>That said, you could substitute Bavarian smoked cheese if you prefer, or indeed gruy\u00e8re or local cheeses like allg\u00e4uer bergk\u00e4se, vorarlberg limburger or weisslacker, if you can get hold of them. As long as the cheese melts easily, it\u2019ll work here. I\u2019ve left out the deep-fried onions they top them with at the restaurant, as it\u2019s too much faff for such a simple, homely dish, but if you can be bothered, they make an excellent addition to the slow-cooked buttery dishes. Pair with a green salad, wash down with a crisp, cold beer, and stick the pasta maker in the shed.</p> <h2>Perfect sp\u00e4tzle</h2> <p>Prep<strong> 10 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>30 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>4</strong> (quantities can be easily halved)</p> <p><strong>2 tbsp butter</strong><br><strong>1 onion</strong>, peeled, halved and finely sliced into half-moons<br><strong>4 large eggs</strong><br><strong>350g Italian 00 or plain flour</strong><br><strong>50g fine semolina</strong><br><strong>\u00bd tsp fine salt</strong><br><strong>Nutmeg</strong><br><strong>120-150ml sparkling water</strong><br><strong>150g emmental, gruy\u00e8re or Bavarian smoked cheese</strong>, finely grated <br><strong>Finely chopped chives</strong>, to top</p> <p>Heat the butter in a frying pan over a low heat, add the onion, and soften until golden, but not brown. Turn off the heat.</p> <p>Meanwhile, put a large pan of salted water on to boil. Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl and whisk until very frothy. Whisk in the flour, semolina, salt and a good grating of nutmeg, then add enough sparkling water to make a stiff batter, if using the board and knife method, or a looser batter more like molten cheese, if using a colander or sp\u00e4tzle press.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbb2f4c449e44d9c4ac279a949b10a7e4cc5cba8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbb2f4c449e44d9c4ac279a949b10a7e4cc5cba8/234_0_7404_7405/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Add flour, salt, semolina, nutmeg and fizzy water to beaten eggs, and whisk until you have a stiff batter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Add flour, salt, semolina, nutmeg and fizzy water to beaten eggs, and whisk until you have a stiff batter.

      "bodyText": "Everyone loves a nice noodle, and these stubby egg twists from Swabia, on Germany\u2019s south-western border, deserve to be better known here, if only our knowledge of the country\u2019s cuisine didn\u2019t start and end with the Black Forest gateau. Variations on the theme are eaten in neighbouring Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, eastern France and even the mountainous Italian province of South Tyrol, but only Swabian sp\u00e4tzle have been recognised by the EU with a Protected Geographical Indication for their quality. Stuttgart-born Steffi of the Ginger &amp; Bread blog writes that \u201csp\u00e4tzle are to the cuisine of my region what rice is to Indian food or chips to Britain: there is hardly a dish that cannot be served, enhanced or transformed with a generous helping of these delicate little noodles\u201d. Drenched in gravy or tossed with greens, they\u2019re deliciously versatile, and considerably quicker and easier to make than Italian pasta or hand-pulled lo mien. In short, this is one recipe guaranteed to improve your life. Flour A fine, soft flour, labelled as 405-type in the German classification, is often used for sp\u00e4tzle in their homeland, but most recipes just call for the nearest British equivalent, plain flour, with the exception of that in Christine McFadden\u2019s book, Flour \u2013 after testing several recipes, she tells me, she found that finely milled Italian 00 flour yielded a more tender, elastic result. Her sp\u00e4tzle are indeed deliciously soft, so if you can find 00, give them a try, though you\u2019ll still get decent results with ordinary plain flour. I\u2019m intrigued by the recipe in Anja Dunk\u2019s Strudel, Noodles &amp; Dumplings, which uses equal quantities of plain flour and finely ground semolina \u2013 a harder durum wheat flour that gives the noodles a springy, slightly coarse consistency I rather like \u2013 though some testers find them a bit chewy in comparison with the all-flour versions. Helpfully, German-based food and travel writer Christie Dietz (whose blog, A Sausage Has Two, is mouthwatering proof that German cooking is more than just beer and bratwurst) tells me that her sister-in-law, who lives in \u201cprime sp\u00e4tzle-making territory\u201d uses a \u201ccoarse-grained flour called Dunst, an \u2018intermediate product\u2019 of wheat and flour. The grain size is between flour and semolina, which means it makes a dough that\u2019s stronger and absorbs more water. Its special features [according to the manufacturer\u2019s website] are that it makes Sp\u00e4tzle robust and a nice yellow colour.\u201d However, Dietz adds, \u201ca mix of semolina and normal white wheat flour [German type 405] can also be used.\u201d That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do, though in deference to those who prefer a softer sp\u00e4tzle, my recipe will contain just enough semolina to give them a slight bounciness, rather than Dunk\u2019s more robustly textured versions, and a good pinch of McFadden and Saveur magazine\u2019s nutmeg to add a subtle warmth. Liquid Sp\u00e4tzle always contain eggs for both colour and flavour, but generally loosened with a less viscous liquid, be that oil, as in chef Alfons Schuhbeck\u2019s The German Cookbook; milk, as in McFadden\u2019s recipe; water, as Dietz recommends; or the sparkling water used by Steffi, who says it \u201cmakes the dough a little bit lighter\u201d. Saveur\u2019s version, based on that served at Munich\u2019s staunchly traditional Spatenhaus an der Oper, uses eggs alone, whisked to a froth \u2013 \u201cthe secret to delicate, tender dumplings\u201d. Milk makes for the softest, squidgiest sp\u00e4tzle, while upping the egg content makes the dough more chewy. It\u2019s a matter of preference, really, but on the basis that most of us prefer a less dense noodle, largely because we can eat more of them, I\u2019m going to whisk the bejesus out of the eggs, and use sparkling water, too. The most important point, according to multiple sources, is to get as much air into the batter as possible, so even if you use milk or tap water, you should, as Dietz puts it, \u201cbeat the dough with a wooden spoon till it bubbles\u201d \u2013 a fact confirmed by Manfred Grossmann, Spatenhaus an der Oper\u2019s chef, who tells Saveur that \u201cthe trick to tender sp\u00e4tzle is whisking the batter vigorously until it\u2019s smooth and frothy with air bubbles\u201d. This requires some serious elbow grease with such a thick batter, but on the plus side, it shouldn\u2019t take long and, if you prefer, you could always use a food mixer to do the hard work. The shaping As Steffi explained to Nigel Slater when he called on her sp\u00e4tzle expertise for his BBC television series Eating Together, \u201cperhaps the most remarkable aspect\u201d of the whole process is \u201cthe way in which sp\u00e4tzle are made, as the individual noodles are \u201cscraped off a board, straight into boiling water\u201d using a metal dough scraper. \u201cI have seen people make sp\u00e4tzle using a knife, and any thin board with a handle,\u201d she concedes. \u201cAll you need is some fine motoric skills, some upper-body strength and determination.\u201d But, when Slater tells you \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of technique to making sp\u00e4tzle\u201d, you sense that it\u2019s not quite as easy as she makes out. Specialist sp\u00e4tzleschwob dough presses are cheap and easily available in Germany and online, but unless you develop a real passion for the stuff, which is not beyond the bounds of possibility, you get fairly similar, if rather stubbier results (strictly speaking, kn\u00f6pfle, or little buttons) by pushing a slightly looser dough through a colander or coarse grater instead, and McFadden swears by her Chinese skimmer. (Some suggest potato ricers also work, but this experiment proves a complete disaster and I can\u2019t in all conscience recommend it.) However, as Deb Perelman of the Smitten Kitchen blog puts it, \u201cI quickly found pressing a thick colander of batter over a boiling pot of water very unpleasant. And hot. And awkward.\u201d And unless you hold it well away from the heat, the batter has a tendency to weld itself to the metal in the process. Oddly, I found the traditional method far easier, even if some of my sp\u00e4tzle are less \u201clittle sparrows\u201d, as the name suggests, and more Christmas turkeys. Practice makes perfect. Rinsing them under cold water to stop them cooking further, and indeed sticking together, is a good idea \u2013 if you want to make them in advance, but serve them plain, you can put them in a heatproof bowl with a sprinkle of water and and store in a low oven rather than saut\u00e9ing them as in the recipe below. Serving suggestions As Steffi notes, sp\u00e4tzle, like chips, go with everything \u2013 \u201cespecially with meats that come with a bit of sauce, such as casserole dishes, but on children\u2019s menus, you\u2019ll often find them served with nothing but a spoonful of light gravy\u201d; McFadden, meanwhile, recommends them as a side to her venison casserole. I try them with a variety of dishes: tossed with smoked bacon and sauerkraut, as in The German Cookbook, baked with chard, sour cream and smoked cheese, as Dunk suggests, and baked with double cream, bacon and cheese in Nigel Slater\u2019s take on the traditional Swabian k\u00e4ssp\u00e4tzle. All are delicious \u2013 how could they not be? \u2013 but my favourite is the simple cheese and onion k\u00e4sssp\u00e4tzle recipe Saveur adapts from that served by Grossman in Munich, gooey with molten emmental. That said, you could substitute Bavarian smoked cheese if you prefer, or indeed gruy\u00e8re or local cheeses like allg\u00e4uer bergk\u00e4se, vorarlberg limburger or weisslacker, if you can get hold of them. As long as the cheese melts easily, it\u2019ll work here. I\u2019ve left out the deep-fried onions they top them with at the restaurant, as it\u2019s too much faff for such a simple, homely dish, but if you can be bothered, they make an excellent addition to the slow-cooked buttery dishes. Pair with a green salad, wash down with a crisp, cold beer, and stick the pasta maker in the shed. Perfect sp\u00e4tzle Prep 10 min Cook 30 min Serves 4 (quantities can be easily halved) 2 tbsp butter 1 onion, peeled, halved and finely sliced into half-moons 4 large eggs 350g Italian 00 or plain flour 50g fine semolina \u00bd tsp fine salt Nutmeg 120-150ml sparkling water 150g emmental, gruy\u00e8re or Bavarian smoked cheese, finely grated Finely chopped chives, to top Heat the butter in a frying pan over a low heat, add the onion, and soften until golden, but not brown. Turn off the heat. Meanwhile, put a large pan of salted water on to boil. Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl and whisk until very frothy. Whisk in the flour, semolina, salt and a good grating of nutmeg, then add enough sparkling water to make a stiff batter, if using the board and knife method, or a looser batter more like molten cheese, if using a colander or sp\u00e4tzle press. Beat the batter with a wooden spoon until you see large bubbles forming, then, when the water has come to a boil, wet a small wooden board and smear a rectangle of dough on to it, spreading it out so it\u2019s thin, but not see-through. Use a metal dough scraper or the blunt side of a chef\u2019s knife to cut very thin strips from the end of the batter and quickly flick these into the pan. Cook for about two minutes, until they\u2019ve risen to the top, then scoop out with a slotted spoon and run under cold water to stop them cooking further. Repeat with the remaining batter. Once you\u2019ve used up all the batter, turn on the heat under the onion pan. Once warm, tip in the sp\u00e4tzle and the cheese, and toss and stir until the latter has melted and coated the former. Divide between bowls, top with a sprinkle of chives and serve hot. \u2022 Sp\u00e4tzle: how do you make yours, and what do you serve them with? Why aren\u2019t they better known here, and which other German dishes deserve international recognition?",

Yet the strong implication of the way Shaw uses empirical evidence throughout the book is that one day, when we can analyse the brain carefully enough, we will find physiological causes for \u201cinexcusable\u201d behaviour from which the subject was in no sense free to resile. At which point it would be a hard person indeed who refused to say: tout comprendre, c\u2019est tout pardonner. \u2022 Making Evil is published by Canongate (\u00a314.99).

      "body": "<p>Politics has always, to some extent, been the art of combining doing what\u2019s right with doing what\u2019s in one\u2019s own political interests. It would be naive to pretend otherwise. But in recent months \u2013 with a weak prime minister desperately trying to cling on to power, and senior Tories hungrily eyeing the top job \u2013 it feels like naked political ambition is shaping real-world outcomes more than ever before.</p> \n<p>Nowhere is that more evident than in Sajid Javid\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/19/isis-briton-shamima-begum-to-have-uk-citizenship-revoked\" title=\"\">decision to revoke</a> Shamima Begum\u2019s British citizenship. In trying to position himself as Theresa May\u2019s successor, the home secretary is signalling to the tabloid press just how tough he is on national security and immigration. Perhaps, as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/09/sajid-javid-breaks-tory-mould-maria-miller\" title=\"\">son of immigrants</a>, he feels he has more to prove.</p> \n<p>But make no mistake, signalling is all it is. Javid is setting this up as a fight between a strong home secretary and a mushy liberal left he can portray as willing to forgive supporters of Islamic State of any crimes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/20/shamima-begum-a-bit-shocked-that-uk-has-revoked-citizenship\">Shamima Begum 'a bit shocked' that UK has revoked citizenship</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The extent to which Begum is responsible for crimes she may have committed is a thorny one. On the one hand, she is a vulnerable young woman who was groomed here in Britain as a child, married off to a man almost twice her age 10 days after arriving in Raqaa, and has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/14/shamima-begum-friends-kadiza-sultana-amira-abase-joined-isis-syria\" title=\"\">lost two children in brutal conditions</a>. On the other, as an adult she has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/15/mi6-chief-britons-joined-isis-cannot-stopped-returning-shamima-begum\" title=\"\">expressed abhorrent views</a> in the handful of media interviews she has given and has failed to unreservedly condemn a terrorist organisation that she has supported in full knowledge of the unspeakable atrocities and genocide it has committed.</p> \n<p>I\u2019m not sure we as observers have the knowledge or evidence to judge the extent to which she is a victim or a perpetrator. That\u2019s for the courts. But it doesn\u2019t matter.

Look at how well that turned out when Osama bin Laden was stripped of his Saudi citizenship in the mid 1990s: he went underground and became harder, not easier, to monitor.

      "bodyText": "Politics has always, to some extent, been the art of combining doing what\u2019s right with doing what\u2019s in one\u2019s own political interests. It would be naive to pretend otherwise. But in recent months \u2013 with a weak prime minister desperately trying to cling on to power, and senior Tories hungrily eyeing the top job \u2013 it feels like naked political ambition is shaping real-world outcomes more than ever before. Nowhere is that more evident than in Sajid Javid\u2019s decision to revoke Shamima Begum\u2019s British citizenship. In trying to position himself as Theresa May\u2019s successor, the home secretary is signalling to the tabloid press just how tough he is on national security and immigration. Perhaps, as a son of immigrants, he feels he has more to prove. But make no mistake, signalling is all it is. Javid is setting this up as a fight between a strong home secretary and a mushy liberal left he can portray as willing to forgive supporters of Islamic State of any crimes. The extent to which Begum is responsible for crimes she may have committed is a thorny one. On the one hand, she is a vulnerable young woman who was groomed here in Britain as a child, married off to a man almost twice her age 10 days after arriving in Raqaa, and has lost two children in brutal conditions. On the other, as an adult she has expressed abhorrent views in the handful of media interviews she has given and has failed to unreservedly condemn a terrorist organisation that she has supported in full knowledge of the unspeakable atrocities and genocide it has committed. I\u2019m not sure we as observers have the knowledge or evidence to judge the extent to which she is a victim or a perpetrator. That\u2019s for the courts. But it doesn\u2019t matter. Even if Begum was the worst terrorist ever to have been born in Britain, Javid\u2019s decision is wrong: both on national security grounds, and because it shuns Britain\u2019s international obligations.

      "body": "<p><em>Founded by architect <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Walter-Gropius\">Walter Gropius</a> in Weimar Germany in 1919, the Bauhaus school has had a huge global influence on art, architecture and design. After relocating to Dessau (arguably its most famous premises) in 1925, it moved to Berlin in 1932, before being closed down by the Nazis the following year. Gropius left Germany in 1934 and spent three years in Britain, before moving to the US in 1937. It was during the 1930s that the Manchester Guardian first started reporting the influence of the Bauhaus on British design, covering <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/02/19/11_June_1934_WG.jpg\">lectures</a> given by Gropius as well as interviewing him.</em></p> <h2>Architecture and science: the designs of Walter Gropius</h2> <p><strong>by our scientific correspondent <br>11 June 1930</strong></p> <p>An English scientific journalist does not usually receive invitations to exhibitions of designs and models by architects. In Germany, apparently, certain schools of architects naturally expect him to visit their exhibitions. The particular contact between architecture and science I found in gropius\u2019 \u2013 (various modern architects and artists do not use capital letters) exhibition was metallurgical, and in conversation with him I learned of his ideas on the relation between architecture and science, a matter specially interesting with reference to the recent lively discussion on the propriety of placing the design of new buildings in Park Lane in the charge of an engineer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/20/bauhaus-at-100-the-revolutionary-movements-enduring-appeal\">Bauhaus at 100: the revolutionary movement's enduring appeal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>gropius does not believe in the supersession of the architect by the engineer, but he considers that the architect must have a thorough knowledge of the properties of building materials and the theory of structures. [He] finds much good architecture in America, but believes the Americans often blunder on to the happy design. They are often unaware of the aesthetic merits of their buildings because the architect made the design from purely utilitarian motives. Of the buildings he saw in America, gropius found Ford\u2019s River Rouge factory at Detroit. the most beautiful.</p> <p>Besides exact knowledge of materials, the modern architect must understand the psychological and physiological effects of colours on people. He must remember that a room with blue walls appears larger than with yellow. (Is it because the mind associates blue with the sky and the idea of space? With regard to physiology, gropius was interested to hear of the remarkable discovery at WP Hartley\u2019s jam factory that flies dislike yellow glass. Rooms and corridors glazed with yellow glass are avoided by flies.)</p> <p>gropius and his school do not consider themselves under the influence of cubism; they make no search for expression in straight lines, nor are they concerned with decoration. They are not interested in trying to design straight-line buildings. Physical comfort is just as important as any other factor in design. gropius considers his steel-and-canvas furniture is as physically comfortable as could be desired, besides offering aesthetic satisfaction, convenience, cheapness of production, and hygiene.</p> <p><strong>Democratic house design </strong><br>The modem architect has to consider the influence of modern social organisation on building design. In the past the house was a refuge. It had to be designed like a fortress, and the intense privacy of fortresses has lingered on in house architecture after its utility has vanished. Adequate social order removes many limitations in house design. The house should be made as open to the world as its inhabitants wish. For those who wish in a democratic age to be one with their neighbours house walls will mainly be made of glass in a steel skeleton. In old buildings, such as the Pantheon at Rome, there is an entire difference of atmosphere between the inside and the world outside. The removal of fear by social order is naturally expressed in the new architecture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01e1fb8eae1b0efc59643f2b49d30726bd00c86b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01e1fb8eae1b0efc59643f2b49d30726bd00c86b/100_0_1548_929/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Guardian, 11 June 1930.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guardian, 11 June 1930.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Nelsson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The determination of minima in strengths and quantities of materials frequently arrives at straight lines and circles. Great importance is attached to the possibilities for manufacture of parts. gropius wishes to discover designs convenient for processes of mass production. One of the functions of the architect is to provide mass-production industry with aesthetic patterns. At present his designs appeal more to the rich private person or corporation than to the social mass in which he is personally more interested.</p> <p>gropius remarks that only in England and Spain has this architectural style few adherents. His first buildings were erected in 1910-12 in Germany, but there was little interest in them until after the war. In the last three years industrial concerns have begun seriously to consider mass manufacture after his designs. He thinks the Americans will develop this style of modern architecture most successfully. They are not so individualistically conservative as Western Europeans.</p> <p><em>This is an edited extract. <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/02/19/wgropius.jpg\">Read the article in full.</a></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/feb/15/rare-works-cultural-magpies-bauhaus-to-go-on-show-london-sothebys\">Rare works by 'cultural magpies' of Bauhaus to go on show in London</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>New architecture: individuality by mass production</h2> <p><strong>from our correspondent<br>18 May 1934</strong></p> <p><em>Liverpool, Thursday</em><br>Addressing the students of the Liverpool School of Architecture this evening, Professor Walter Gropius, the distinguished German architect, said that the next generation would witness the general adoption and the refinement of the new architecture. Our conception of new architecture was nowhere in opposition that of tradition, and the greatest opposition which the new architecture encountered was the result of the demand of modern architects that the principle of mass production should be applied to house construction.</p> <p>The danger of monotonisation of form could be overcome the moment it was possible to manufacture in series not whole houses but only their component puts, so that different types of houses could be assembled to correspond to the needs of individual requirements. The goal to be aimed at was, therefore, a box of bricks for adults.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The use of flat roofs as gardens was a means of introducing nature into the stony grey wastes of our great cities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The development of airways confronted the architect with a task of designing houses from the bird\u2019s-eye point of view as well as ordinary perspective. The use of flat roofs as gardens was a means of introducing nature into the stony grey wastes of our great cities. The cities of the future, with their green, leafy roofs, would have the appearance of vast gardens when seen from the air. But the outstanding advantage of the flat roof was that it made possible a much freer type of planning.</p> <p>\u201cGood architecture,\u201d declared Professor Gropius, \u201cdepends on the systematic solution of the great problems of national planning, on the interpenetration of town and country by loosening the warp and weft of the stuff of our cities, on the linking up of industry and agriculture, on coordinated concentration and redistribution of population ... and also on the solution of the ideal type of dwelling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5dd37d5b64bfc834199e10c7c3d680c76a98ff34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dd37d5b64bfc834199e10c7c3d680c76a98ff34/0_388_5078_3046/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Walter Gropius, 1930.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Walter Gropius, 1930.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ullstein bild via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Green town for England: cities of the future \u2013 the vision of Herr Gropius</h2> <p><strong>by our special representative<br>21 February 1937</strong></p> <p>England could be a land of green towns. Her townsmen could be countrymen within their cities. Wide garden spaces could lie where her slums now sprawl</p> <p>So thinks Professor Walter Gropius, distinguished German architect, after living and working in England for nearly three years. But Professor Gropius can not stay to help us realise his vision. First attending a dinner given in his honour by English architects, he will move on in a few weeks to America, there to occupy the Graduate Chair of Architecture in Harvard University.</p> <p>Therefore, before he went, it seemed appropriate to ask him where, after his foreign intimacy with us, he thought we were heading, what our modem architects are making of England, whether they are creating another English period for future delight as did their Georgian predecessors, or, merely Imitating foreign designs of alien ideas.</p> <p><strong>\u201cLovely\u201d Bath</strong><br>Professor Gropius, most unprofessorially youthful in build and features, resembling rather the English than the German style of human architecture, has made two discoveries in England. One is Bath: \u2013</p> <p>\u201cBath is my greatest discovery. I am thrilled by Bath. This mixture of open green spaces and lovely crescents, it is first rate, even from the point of view of modern town planning. Your Georgian town planning expressed the Englishman, his instinct not to be too different, to think in terms of the whole street rather than of each separate house in it.\u201d</p> <p>His other discovery is the rural nature of the English town-dweller \u2013 <br> \u201cI have the impression that the town-dweller in your country always tries to imitate the country, even in the slums.\u201d </p> <p>Now those two discoveries, the planned perfection of Bath and the essential rusticity of the English townsman, although he did not express them side by side like that, are the facts which Professor Gropius would keep most in mind if he were planning the architectural future of England.</p> <p><strong>Planning difficulties</strong><br> \u201cThe old Georgian architects,\u201d he says, \u201chad an easier task. The lease system is the greatest hindrance to the modern architect. Town planning is difficult unless the authorities have the right to expropriate ground. I have a horror of the modern town in which each house is different in material and style. The street, and not the house, should be the standard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1dda801c4e0cd6056151858956d9b85d16ae07f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1dda801c4e0cd6056151858956d9b85d16ae07f/255_42_566_340/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Guardian, 18 May 1937.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guardian, 18 May 1937.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Nelsson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is no use building new homes for slum dwellers in the suburbs far away from their work. The only solution for the slum-clearance problem is to build high \u2013 not four or five storey high, but 10 or 12. Then you can have wide spaces between the buildings \u2013 no dark allays and landings artificially lit by day.\u201d</p> <p>And so you would have the green town. \u201cPrivacy? The Englishman\u2019s liking for his own separate roof? Yes, I know there is an imaginative difficulty. But what nonsense to talk of privacy in a modern slum!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/nov/07/the-women-of-bauhaus\">Haus proud: The women of Bauhaus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>England was the first country to drop handicrafts and take to the machine. Now you are coming more and more to believe in the importance of workshop training as part of your children\u2019s education, the education of the hands as well as the mind. There is going to be more leisure in the future. For that some kind of hobby training will be invaluable, provided the results of the hobbies are useful to the community.</p> <p><strong>The English architects</strong><br>I believe that the handicraftsman of the past will, in his greater leisure, become the research and laboratory worker, in the widest sense, for the industry of the future. Thus the whole community will share in town planning.</p> <p>I tried to do something of the sort in Germany, by bringing together a whole panel of collaborators. We had our own workshops, where we worked not merely as designers and architects, but with real tools and real materials.\u201d</p> <p>As for the younger English architects, Professor Gropius thinks that something \u201cpeculiarly English\u201d will arise from their work. \u201cBut,\u201d he adds, \u201csome of them are too fond of concrete, an interesting material, but very difficult. It rings like a bell; it\u2019s very noisy.\u201d Work honestly with the new material, is his great maxim for the modern architect. No imitation candles and fake logs.

Marcel Breuer</a>, the inventor of modern steel furniture, is at present making a short visit to England. He told me to-day of the circumstances of his invention, which was made in 1925, when he was a member of the staff of the Bauhaus, or School of Architecture, at Dessau, in Germany. He had been devoting much time to the improvement of the design of wood furniture, to make it more elastic, economical, and handsome. One day he bought a tricycle, and, not knowing how to ride, had to learn. The idea of using steel for making furniture came to him while straining and struggling with the handlebars of his bicycle during his attempts to ride. He began to make furniture out of bent steel tubing at the Bauhaus. He tried to interest manufacturers in it, but it was rejected as fantastic, and was said to make living rooms look like dentists\u2019 surgeries. He then made it with his own hands with a few assistants After a time its attractions became obvious, and manufacturers began to produce it on a large scale.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa2b9a1029bb8fb8108939b35e5cf62f36cef427\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa2b9a1029bb8fb8108939b35e5cf62f36cef427/0_233_5020_3014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wassily Chair, B3, designed by Marcel Breuer at Bauhaus School.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wassily Chair, B3, designed by Marcel Breuer at Bauhaus School.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He is now interested in furniture made out of aluminium alloys.

      "bodyText": "Founded by architect Walter Gropius in Weimar Germany in 1919, the Bauhaus school has had a huge global influence on art, architecture and design. After relocating to Dessau (arguably its most famous premises) in 1925, it moved to Berlin in 1932, before being closed down by the Nazis the following year. Gropius left Germany in 1934 and spent three years in Britain, before moving to the US in 1937. It was during the 1930s that the Manchester Guardian first started reporting the influence of the Bauhaus on British design, covering lectures given by Gropius as well as interviewing him. Architecture and science: the designs of Walter Gropius by our scientific correspondent 11 June 1930 An English scientific journalist does not usually receive invitations to exhibitions of designs and models by architects. In Germany, apparently, certain schools of architects naturally expect him to visit their exhibitions. The particular contact between architecture and science I found in gropius\u2019 \u2013 (various modern architects and artists do not use capital letters) exhibition was metallurgical, and in conversation with him I learned of his ideas on the relation between architecture and science, a matter specially interesting with reference to the recent lively discussion on the propriety of placing the design of new buildings in Park Lane in the charge of an engineer. gropius does not believe in the supersession of the architect by the engineer, but he considers that the architect must have a thorough knowledge of the properties of building materials and the theory of structures. [He] finds much good architecture in America, but believes the Americans often blunder on to the happy design. They are often unaware of the aesthetic merits of their buildings because the architect made the design from purely utilitarian motives. Of the buildings he saw in America, gropius found Ford\u2019s River Rouge factory at Detroit. the most beautiful. Besides exact knowledge of materials, the modern architect must understand the psychological and physiological effects of colours on people. He must remember that a room with blue walls appears larger than with yellow. (Is it because the mind associates blue with the sky and the idea of space? With regard to physiology, gropius was interested to hear of the remarkable discovery at WP Hartley\u2019s jam factory that flies dislike yellow glass. Rooms and corridors glazed with yellow glass are avoided by flies.) gropius and his school do not consider themselves under the influence of cubism; they make no search for expression in straight lines, nor are they concerned with decoration. They are not interested in trying to design straight-line buildings. Physical comfort is just as important as any other factor in design. gropius considers his steel-and-canvas furniture is as physically comfortable as could be desired, besides offering aesthetic satisfaction, convenience, cheapness of production, and hygiene. Democratic house design The modem architect has to consider the influence of modern social organisation on building design. In the past the house was a refuge. It had to be designed like a fortress, and the intense privacy of fortresses has lingered on in house architecture after its utility has vanished. Adequate social order removes many limitations in house design. The house should be made as open to the world as its inhabitants wish. For those who wish in a democratic age to be one with their neighbours house walls will mainly be made of glass in a steel skeleton. In old buildings, such as the Pantheon at Rome, there is an entire difference of atmosphere between the inside and the world outside. The removal of fear by social order is naturally expressed in the new architecture. The determination of minima in strengths and quantities of materials frequently arrives at straight lines and circles. Great importance is attached to the possibilities for manufacture of parts. gropius wishes to discover designs convenient for processes of mass production. One of the functions of the architect is to provide mass-production industry with aesthetic patterns. At present his designs appeal more to the rich private person or corporation than to the social mass in which he is personally more interested. gropius remarks that only in England and Spain has this architectural style few adherents. His first buildings were erected in 1910-12 in Germany, but there was little interest in them until after the war. In the last three years industrial concerns have begun seriously to consider mass manufacture after his designs. He thinks the Americans will develop this style of modern architecture most successfully. They are not so individualistically conservative as Western Europeans. This is an edited extract. Read the article in full. New architecture: individuality by mass production from our correspondent 18 May 1934 Liverpool, Thursday Addressing the students of the Liverpool School of Architecture this evening, Professor Walter Gropius, the distinguished German architect, said that the next generation would witness the general adoption and the refinement of the new architecture. Our conception of new architecture was nowhere in opposition that of tradition, and the greatest opposition which the new architecture encountered was the result of the demand of modern architects that the principle of mass production should be applied to house construction. The danger of monotonisation of form could be overcome the moment it was possible to manufacture in series not whole houses but only their component puts, so that different types of houses could be assembled to correspond to the needs of individual requirements. The goal to be aimed at was, therefore, a box of bricks for adults. The development of airways confronted the architect with a task of designing houses from the bird\u2019s-eye point of view as well as ordinary perspective. The use of flat roofs as gardens was a means of introducing nature into the stony grey wastes of our great cities. The cities of the future, with their green, leafy roofs, would have the appearance of vast gardens when seen from the air. But the outstanding advantage of the flat roof was that it made possible a much freer type of planning. \u201cGood architecture,\u201d declared Professor Gropius, \u201cdepends on the systematic solution of the great problems of national planning, on the interpenetration of town and country by loosening the warp and weft of the stuff of our cities, on the linking up of industry and agriculture, on coordinated concentration and redistribution of population ... and also on the solution of the ideal type of dwelling.\u201d Green town for England: cities of the future \u2013 the vision of Herr Gropius by our special representative 21 February 1937 England could be a land of green towns. Her townsmen could be countrymen within their cities. Wide garden spaces could lie where her slums now sprawl So thinks Professor Walter Gropius, distinguished German architect, after living and working in England for nearly three years. But Professor Gropius can not stay to help us realise his vision. First attending a dinner given in his honour by English architects, he will move on in a few weeks to America, there to occupy the Graduate Chair of Architecture in Harvard University. Therefore, before he went, it seemed appropriate to ask him where, after his foreign intimacy with us, he thought we were heading, what our modem architects are making of England, whether they are creating another English period for future delight as did their Georgian predecessors, or, merely Imitating foreign designs of alien ideas. \u201cLovely\u201d Bath Professor Gropius, most unprofessorially youthful in build and features, resembling rather the English than the German style of human architecture, has made two discoveries in England. One is Bath: \u2013 \u201cBath is my greatest discovery. I am thrilled by Bath. This mixture of open green spaces and lovely crescents, it is first rate, even from the point of view of modern town planning. Your Georgian town planning expressed the Englishman, his instinct not to be too different, to think in terms of the whole street rather than of each separate house in it.\u201d His other discovery is the rural nature of the English town-dweller \u2013 \u201cI have the impression that the town-dweller in your country always tries to imitate the country, even in the slums.\u201d Now those two discoveries, the planned perfection of Bath and the essential rusticity of the English townsman, although he did not express them side by side like that, are the facts which Professor Gropius would keep most in mind if he were planning the architectural future of England. Planning difficulties \u201cThe old Georgian architects,\u201d he says, \u201chad an easier task. The lease system is the greatest hindrance to the modern architect. Town planning is difficult unless the authorities have the right to expropriate ground. I have a horror of the modern town in which each house is different in material and style. The street, and not the house, should be the standard. It is no use building new homes for slum dwellers in the suburbs far away from their work. The only solution for the slum-clearance problem is to build high \u2013 not four or five storey high, but 10 or 12. Then you can have wide spaces between the buildings \u2013 no dark allays and landings artificially lit by day.\u201d And so you would have the green town. \u201cPrivacy? The Englishman\u2019s liking for his own separate roof? Yes, I know there is an imaginative difficulty. But what nonsense to talk of privacy in a modern slum!\u201d England was the first country to drop handicrafts and take to the machine. Now you are coming more and more to believe in the importance of workshop training as part of your children\u2019s education, the education of the hands as well as the mind. There is going to be more leisure in the future. For that some kind of hobby training will be invaluable, provided the results of the hobbies are useful to the community. The English architects I believe that the handicraftsman of the past will, in his greater leisure, become the research and laboratory worker, in the widest sense, for the industry of the future. Thus the whole community will share in town planning. I tried to do something of the sort in Germany, by bringing together a whole panel of collaborators. We had our own workshops, where we worked not merely as designers and architects, but with real tools and real materials.\u201d As for the younger English architects, Professor Gropius thinks that something \u201cpeculiarly English\u201d will arise from their work. \u201cBut,\u201d he adds, \u201csome of them are too fond of concrete, an interesting material, but very difficult. It rings like a bell; it\u2019s very noisy.\u201d Work honestly with the new material, is his great maxim for the modern architect. No imitation candles and fake logs. Let a radiator be a radiator and an electric lamp an electric lamp. \u201cIn the best periods of architecture they never imitated.\u201d Aluminium for furniture: inventor\u2019s experiments from our scientific correspondent 11 July 1935 M. Marcel Breuer, the inventor of modern steel furniture, is at present making a short visit to England. He told me to-day of the circumstances of his invention, which was made in 1925, when he was a member of the staff of the Bauhaus, or School of Architecture, at Dessau, in Germany. He had been devoting much time to the improvement of the design of wood furniture, to make it more elastic, economical, and handsome. One day he bought a tricycle, and, not knowing how to ride, had to learn. The idea of using steel for making furniture came to him while straining and struggling with the handlebars of his bicycle during his attempts to ride. He began to make furniture out of bent steel tubing at the Bauhaus. He tried to interest manufacturers in it, but it was rejected as fantastic, and was said to make living rooms look like dentists\u2019 surgeries. He then made it with his own hands with a few assistants After a time its attractions became obvious, and manufacturers began to produce it on a large scale. He is now interested in furniture made out of aluminium alloys. In 1933 the international aluminium industry organised an exhibition of materials in Paris. Two independent juries, one of businessmen and the other of architects, each awarded him a first prize for aluminium alloy furniture. Pure aluminium is not elastic and does not resist corrosion, but certain alloys possess these properties in a high degree. Breuer has designed chairs of elastic non-corroding aluminium alloys which weigh less than four pounds. Some of the first inquiries for Breuer\u2019s aluminium alloy furniture have come from Syria and Egypt. In those countries wooden furniture is often rapidly eaten by mites. He expects it to be most useful in England, where the damp and smoky air often successfully attacks even rust-resisting steel alloys. M. Breuer is of course, deeply interested in the general problems of furniture design apart from the utilisation of particular materials. In the days when houses had large rooms the size of furniture was not so important as to-day, when rooms are small and the problems of harmonious arrangement and economical use of space are much more difficult. It is necessary, too, that furniture should be easily moved and cleaned, so that the energy of housewives and servants can be saved. He explains that the most important objects in a room are the persons that live in it, and if the room does not express their spirit it is badly furnished, even if the composition of the furnishing is in itself perfect. The room and its furniture should be subjugated to the purposes of its occupants.",

While working at the dining table, he counted 84 people taking photographs in 90 minutes.

People waved and made obscene gestures at her and her family. Her husband, Giles Fearn, found pictures of their home posted online by strangers.

They had to be \u201cproperly dressed\u201d at all times, and even then they were often photographed or filmed, and sometimes spied on with binoculars. McFadyen set out to measure the problem. While working at the dining table, he counted 84 people taking photographs in 90 minutes. This is the reality of living in a glass-walled flat in Block C of Neo Bankside, just 34 metres from the viewing gallery at Tate Modern, which receives up to 600,000 visitors a year. A neighbour, Claire Fearn, said being watched like that made her \u201csick to her stomach\u201d. People waved and made obscene gestures at her and her family. Her husband, Giles Fearn, found pictures of their home posted online by strangers. Many of the images are still on Twitter, often with amused remarks about the misfortune of their wealthy owners. (The flats are worth an average of \u00a34.35m each.) Another neighbour, Lindsay Urquhart, visited the viewing gallery and heard someone remark that she and the other residents of Block C deserved to lose their privacy because they were \u201crich bastards\u201d.

In The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s review of the film, the critic wrote: \u201cMoura paints Marighella himself as a tirelessly self-sacrificing martyr \u2026 even though his real Marxist-informed ideology was more astringent than that. \u201cThe filmmaker arguably does Marighella\u2019s legacy a disservice by simplifying him into a humanitarian freedom fighter battling against one-dimensional fascist enemies.\u201d The film has also sparked debate about race \u2013 some on the right have accused Moura of criminalising blacks by casting Seu Jorge, a black singer-turned-actor, as the lead. \u201cWagner Moura wants to reduce the black population by portraying them as CRIMINALS,\u201d wrote Sara Winter, a conservative personality. \u201cWhites can also be criminals, Wagner, it\u2019s not just blacks that commit crimes.\u201d \u201cThe shade of his skin tone didn\u2019t really interest me,\u201d Moura said before the film was released. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to discuss any social issue in Brazil without talking about racial issues. For me, Marighella had to be black.\u201d According to Marighella\u2019s biographer, he was mixed race, with a white father and a black grandmother. While the film has riled the president and his supporters, Moura says it isn\u2019t a direct response to Bolsonaro\u2019s rise to power. \u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the first cultural manifestations that\u2019s obviously in contrast to the group that\u2019s in power in Brazil. Our film is bigger than Bolsonaro.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>There have been quite a few studies recently that demonstrate the benefits of wine consumption, particularly red. Despite the many criticisms saying alcohol is bad for you, a consistent body of evidence shows that a modest amount of wine consumption is associated with reduced risk of heart disease.</p> <p>For one randomised control trial carried out in Israel recently, a group of non-alcohol drinkers with raised blood sugar levels were asked to drink water, or a glass of red wine, or a glass of white wine, every evening for two years. At the end of that period, the people who showed the most benefit were the red drinkers, followed by the white wine drinkers, followed by the water drinkers, in terms of the impact on their cardiovascular system, as well as on their sleep. The researchers also did genetic tests and found that those who were slow alcohol metabolisers \u2013 which meant the alcohol hung around in their system for longer \u2013 were the ones who got the most benefit.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There seems to be benefit from drinking wine with a meal, as opposed to on its own. Part of this is down to conviviality</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, there are great risks if you drink immoderately. After a glass or two a day, the benefits drop off pretty dramatically and disadvantages start to emerge, particularly the risk of liver and breast cancer. But even the scary-sounding studies that you keep on reading about in the papers find that, with moderate drinking, there was almost no effect and, if anything, it was positive.</p> <p>The current UK guidelines \u2013 which are much lower than in Italy and Spain \u2013 advise limiting alcohol intake to 14 units a week (or around seven 175ml glasses of 12% ABV wine). The problem with units is that they are almost impossible to pin down.

      "bodyText": "There have been quite a few studies recently that demonstrate the benefits of wine consumption, particularly red. Despite the many criticisms saying alcohol is bad for you, a consistent body of evidence shows that a modest amount of wine consumption is associated with reduced risk of heart disease. For one randomised control trial carried out in Israel recently, a group of non-alcohol drinkers with raised blood sugar levels were asked to drink water, or a glass of red wine, or a glass of white wine, every evening for two years. At the end of that period, the people who showed the most benefit were the red drinkers, followed by the white wine drinkers, followed by the water drinkers, in terms of the impact on their cardiovascular system, as well as on their sleep. The researchers also did genetic tests and found that those who were slow alcohol metabolisers \u2013 which meant the alcohol hung around in their system for longer \u2013 were the ones who got the most benefit. Of course, there are great risks if you drink immoderately. After a glass or two a day, the benefits drop off pretty dramatically and disadvantages start to emerge, particularly the risk of liver and breast cancer. But even the scary-sounding studies that you keep on reading about in the papers find that, with moderate drinking, there was almost no effect and, if anything, it was positive. The current UK guidelines \u2013 which are much lower than in Italy and Spain \u2013 advise limiting alcohol intake to 14 units a week (or around seven 175ml glasses of 12% ABV wine). The problem with units is that they are almost impossible to pin down. The effect of alcohol differs person-by-person, depending on body size, gender, and also how you metabolise alcohol. The sensible reaction to all of this is to not give up drinking wine full stop but rather to enjoy your wine, to savour it. Call it mindful drinking. We have a tendency to gulp things down, but if you slow down and really enjoy what\u2019s in your glass, you\u2019ll probably drink less as well. I drink only red wine these days, having been persuaded by the studies, and I try to follow a 5:2 pattern, taking a couple of days off drinking each week. Lots of liver specialists I\u2019ve spoken to recommend this, to show, if nothing else, that you can break the habit. There also seems to be some benefit from drinking wine with a meal, as opposed to on its own.

      "body": "<p>Bernie Sanders declared on Tuesday that he will once again run for president. Whatever this election season holds for him, he\u2019s already the most important candidate in the race.</p> <p>Emerging seemingly out of nowhere, Sanders\u2019s first Democratic primary run in 2016 brought tens of thousands of people \u2013 millennials especially \u2013 into the work of politics, not just to cast a ballot but to knock on doors and phone bank, host community meetings and wrangle straws in Iowa. Among them was the now representative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/16/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-2020-endorsement-democrats\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, who has credited her organizing on the Sanders campaign for helping to reignite her interest in politics.</p> <p>Sanders didn\u2019t win, of course. But the results of his campaign defied all conventional horse-race logic. The man widely expected to be little more than an off-brand Dennis Kucinich won 23 states and 47% of pledged party delegates. In all, over 13 million people voted for an avowed democratic socialist.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/11/sign-up-for-the-best-of-opinion-us-daily-email\">See things from another point of view. Sign up for the US opinion email</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the wreckage of Hillary Clinton\u2019s historic loss, it became abundantly clear that the Democratic party\u2019s center could not hold. Sanders \u2013 now joined by Ocasio-Cortez and a new generation of left-leaning politicians \u2013have given a party that lacked ideas and momentum a new lease on life. Indeed, it\u2019s painful to imagine what the Democrats would be doing without them. (Fighting for tax credits to put solar panels on Trump\u2019s border wall, perhaps? Or lowering prescription drug prices for prisoners fighting wildfires in California? We can only speculate.)</p> <p>Instead, the types of ideas laughed off in the 2016 primary as \u201c<a href=\"https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/16/my-unicorn-problem/\">magical unicorns</a>\u201d are now firmly in the party\u2019s mainstream, even as they make its <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/04/26/steny-hoyer-audio-levi-tillemann/\">top brass sweat</a>. Sensing a change in the political weather, skilled politicians who built their careers as sensible, business-friendly moderates, like Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker, are rebranding themselves as bold progressives to vie for the party\u2019s presidential nomination. Each has backed once fringe-left proposals such as Medicare-for-All, a federal job guarantee and a Green New Deal \u2013 all of which are hugely popular among voters. Young voters especially \u2013 on the cusp of becoming the country\u2019s largest voter demographic \u2013 want a candidate who will do more than pay lip service to progressive ideals. As a result, several 2020 candidates now sound more like Sanders than their former selves.</p> <p>And though they may still run, shifting waters have made old guard figures like Joe Biden and billionaires Michael Bloomberg and Howard Schultz look increasingly \u2013 and accurately \u2013 like out-of-touch dinosaurs.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019s 2016 candidacy wrote the rules by which the Democratic party is now operating, and that will ultimately help it beat Trump in the general election. Ironically, his remarkable success could make this primary run harder for him than the last. Unlike his battle against Hillary Clinton, this election will see Sanders \u2013 no longer an unknown outsider \u2013 try to differentiate himself from a field of candidates with platforms not all that different from his own, most notably Elizabeth Warren.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/15/democratic-2020-president-candidates-wall-street\">These 2020 hopefuls are courting Wall Street. Don't be fooled by their progressive veneer | Bhaskar Sunkara</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That said, while Sanders\u2019s ideas won\u2019t set him apart from this field as dramatically as they did in 2016, his authenticity still might. Harris, Gillibrand and Booker are all recent converts to big progressive policies. Sanders has been saying the same thing for 40 years \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000004398616/bernie-sanders-40-years-in-one-speech.html\">almost comically so</a>. That he is constitutionally incapable of lying has been a major part of his appeal, and a stark contrast from polished party functionaries willing to change their tune to suit a new poll or donor. The onus will be on candidates newly gravitating toward left ideas to prove their endorsements of progressive policies are more than just empty talking points.</p> <p>What remains unique about Sanders, too, is his long-held belief that political change is driven from below. As other candidates pitch their own progressive bona fides, Sanders will pitch a political revolution. Investing too much faith in any one person is a dangerous thing, particularly in an office as fraught as the American presidency \u2013 for him, just a means to an end. Sanders is all too aware that he\u2019ll need an army at his back to get anything done should he win. Accordingly, he\u2019ll treat his campaign as an opportunity to train them into fighting shape.</p> <p>The Democratic party is stronger for Sanders having thrown his wrench into its coronation plans two years ago. And we\u2019re all better off.

      "bodyText": "Bernie Sanders declared on Tuesday that he will once again run for president. Whatever this election season holds for him, he\u2019s already the most important candidate in the race. Emerging seemingly out of nowhere, Sanders\u2019s first Democratic primary run in 2016 brought tens of thousands of people \u2013 millennials especially \u2013 into the work of politics, not just to cast a ballot but to knock on doors and phone bank, host community meetings and wrangle straws in Iowa. Among them was the now representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has credited her organizing on the Sanders campaign for helping to reignite her interest in politics. Sanders didn\u2019t win, of course. But the results of his campaign defied all conventional horse-race logic. The man widely expected to be little more than an off-brand Dennis Kucinich won 23 states and 47% of pledged party delegates. In all, over 13 million people voted for an avowed democratic socialist. In the wreckage of Hillary Clinton\u2019s historic loss, it became abundantly clear that the Democratic party\u2019s center could not hold. Sanders \u2013 now joined by Ocasio-Cortez and a new generation of left-leaning politicians \u2013have given a party that lacked ideas and momentum a new lease on life. Indeed, it\u2019s painful to imagine what the Democrats would be doing without them. (Fighting for tax credits to put solar panels on Trump\u2019s border wall, perhaps? Or lowering prescription drug prices for prisoners fighting wildfires in California? We can only speculate.) Instead, the types of ideas laughed off in the 2016 primary as \u201cmagical unicorns\u201d are now firmly in the party\u2019s mainstream, even as they make its top brass sweat. Sensing a change in the political weather, skilled politicians who built their careers as sensible, business-friendly moderates, like Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker, are rebranding themselves as bold progressives to vie for the party\u2019s presidential nomination. Each has backed once fringe-left proposals such as Medicare-for-All, a federal job guarantee and a Green New Deal \u2013 all of which are hugely popular among voters. Young voters especially \u2013 on the cusp of becoming the country\u2019s largest voter demographic \u2013 want a candidate who will do more than pay lip service to progressive ideals. As a result, several 2020 candidates now sound more like Sanders than their former selves. And though they may still run, shifting waters have made old guard figures like Joe Biden and billionaires Michael Bloomberg and Howard Schultz look increasingly \u2013 and accurately \u2013 like out-of-touch dinosaurs. Sanders\u2019s 2016 candidacy wrote the rules by which the Democratic party is now operating, and that will ultimately help it beat Trump in the general election. Ironically, his remarkable success could make this primary run harder for him than the last. Unlike his battle against Hillary Clinton, this election will see Sanders \u2013 no longer an unknown outsider \u2013 try to differentiate himself from a field of candidates with platforms not all that different from his own, most notably Elizabeth Warren. That said, while Sanders\u2019s ideas won\u2019t set him apart from this field as dramatically as they did in 2016, his authenticity still might. Harris, Gillibrand and Booker are all recent converts to big progressive policies. Sanders has been saying the same thing for 40 years \u2013 almost comically so. That he is constitutionally incapable of lying has been a major part of his appeal, and a stark contrast from polished party functionaries willing to change their tune to suit a new poll or donor. The onus will be on candidates newly gravitating toward left ideas to prove their endorsements of progressive policies are more than just empty talking points. What remains unique about Sanders, too, is his long-held belief that political change is driven from below. As other candidates pitch their own progressive bona fides, Sanders will pitch a political revolution. Investing too much faith in any one person is a dangerous thing, particularly in an office as fraught as the American presidency \u2013 for him, just a means to an end. Sanders is all too aware that he\u2019ll need an army at his back to get anything done should he win. Accordingly, he\u2019ll treat his campaign as an opportunity to train them into fighting shape. The Democratic party is stronger for Sanders having thrown his wrench into its coronation plans two years ago. And we\u2019re all better off. It\u2019s painfully easy to imagine two years of an electoral news cycle orbiting around personality beefs and debates about \u201celectability\u201d instead of, say, the looming collapse of human civilization. With as few as 11 years left before the climate crisis veers into a full-on global catastrophe, the presidential race needs to be a place to debate issues, not individuals. With Sanders on the scene, we can rest assured that it will be. Bernie Sanders showed us that another world is possible. If that world becomes a reality, we\u2019ll have him to thank \u2013 whether he becomes president or not. Kate Aronoff is a freelance writer based in New York",

His candidacy raises questions about the continued viability of the leftist resurgence that was ushered in partially by his influence in the 2018 midterms, and has sparked fights, similar to those that sprung from Sanders\u2019 last unsuccessful presidential bid in 2016, over whether the Democratic base should commit itself to ameliorating economic inequality, or to fighting racist and sexist bigotry.

Citing Bafta\u2019s own regulation that \u201cfilms should not be screened purely to qualify them for these awards\u201d, Richards says: \u201cIt is clear that Netflix made at best a token effort to screen Roma, screening it to less than 1% of the UK market solely because it wanted an award.

      "bodyText": "One of the UK\u2019s biggest cinema chains, Vue, has threatened to boycott the Baftas after the success of Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Roma at its recent ceremony, where it won four awards including best film. In an open letter, Vue\u2019s chief executive Tim Richards said Bafta had broken its own rules by allowing Roma to be eligible for its awards, saying: \u201cWe believe that Bafta has not lived up to its usual high standards this year in choosing to endorse and promote a \u2018made for TV\u2019 film that audiences were unable to see on a big screen.\u201d He added: \u201cIt saddens me that the Academy has chosen to ignore the opportunity to defend this principle. I regret that in future we will not be able to support the Bafta awards as we usually do unless the Academy board reconsiders its eligibility criteria.\u201d Roma\u2019s distribution rights were purchased by streaming giant Netflix, who opted to give the film a short run in cinemas before releasing it on its website. However, Richards says that, while \u201cCuar\u00f3n is an incredible film-maker for whom I have a huge amount of respect\u201d, the film\u2019s tiny cinema release should have resulted its exclusion from the Bafta awards. Citing Bafta\u2019s own regulation that \u201cfilms should not be screened purely to qualify them for these awards\u201d, Richards says: \u201cIt is clear that Netflix made at best a token effort to screen Roma, screening it to less than 1% of the UK market solely because it wanted an award. How could Bafta let this happen?\u201d While Netflix has a deal with UK distributors Curzon to release its films in its chain of arthouse cinemas, it does not report box office figures to data analysts Comscore, who provide information for the box office charts. Richards says Netflix\u2019s \u201ctactics and secrecy \u2026 is another example of how Netflix acts outside the industry while at the same time it craves its acceptance\u201d. Richards is particularly aggrieved that Netflix has failed to respect the \u201cbox office window\u201d, the traditional period at the start of a major film\u2019s release during which it is only available in cinemas. \u201cImagine the message that could have been sent by Bafta if Netflix were forced to abide by the rules underlining the principle that a film must have a full theatrical release, otherwise it\u2019s just a \u2018made-for-TV\u2019 production.\u201d In a statement, Bafta denied any wrongdoing saying: \u201cThe Film Committee is satisfied that every film in contention for this year\u2019s Film Awards met the criteria for entry, which includes a meaningful UK theatrical release \u2026 We review our criteria annually in close consultation with the industry to ensure that our eligibility criteria remain fit for purpose.\u201d Philip Knatchbull, CEO of Curzon, defended Roma\u2019s release pattern, pointing out that Cold War \u2013 also nominated for best foreign film at the Baftas and Oscars \u2013 was released simultaneously on Curzon\u2019s streaming service Curzon Home Cinema. \u201cIt [is] a strategy born partly from the unreliable and fragmentary support we [receive] from some of the larger cinema operators ...

      "body": "<p>Coming out is one of the most daunting things a queer person will have to do. My parents are very liberal, but I still felt sick when, aged 25, I realised I had to tell them I was a lesbian: it felt like too much information, as though I was announcing I liked it from behind. This was just the last in a series of comings-out. When I was 12, my friends read my diary and realised I had a crush on another girl. Soon afterwards, an actual boy kissed me on the cheek at his bar mitzvah and everyone forgot about the girl. Aged 14, I told a few people I was gay, but then I developed a crush on Eddie Izzard and decided I was bisexual. Finding another woman to be bisexual with seemed like a lot of effort, though, so I pretty much forgot about fancying women until I was in my 20s.</p> <p>Coming out never happens just once. First you have to acknowledge your sexuality or gender identity to yourself. Then you might tell your friends and family, add a rainbow flag to your Twitter bio, ostentatiously read Sarah Waters novels on the train, that sort of thing. But it doesn\u2019t end there. You\u2019ll come out over and over again for the rest of your life \u2013 to the new guy at work who asks whether you\u2019re married, to the family friend who assumes \u201cpartner\u201d means \u201cbusiness associate\u201d, and to the estate agent who thinks your wife is your daughter. (This has happened to me twice. <em>Twice</em>.)</p> <p>To me, being queer is an absolute gift, and that\u2019s reflected in my novel, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/in-at-the-deep-end-9780008311346.html\">In at the Deep End</a>. It tells the story of Julia, who comes out in her mid-20s and is thrilled when she realises that queer culture is her culture \u2013 Dusty Springfield, But I\u2019m a Cheerleader, the colour pink, vegan food, all the best things \u2013 and throws herself into the life with gay abandon.</p> <p>Of course, the fight for LGBTQ equality is far from over, and being openly queer is a privilege that millions of people around the world don\u2019t enjoy, but I wanted to celebrate the sheer joy of finding your community and figuring out who you are.</p> <p>Here, in no particular order, are 10 very good books about coming out.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.eleanorcrewesillustration.co.uk/thetimesiknewiwasgay#1\">The Times I Knew I Was Gay by Eleanor Crewes</a><br></strong>In this charming, funny comic, Crewes traces the moments she realised she might be gay, from her holy communion to her first date with a woman. She describes the \u201cburst of life\u201d she feels when she comes out once and for all \u2013 and the regret that it has taken her so long. </p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/tipping-the-velvet-9781860495243.html\">Tipping the Velvet by Sarah Waters</a><br></strong>Waters\u2019 first novel, set in the 1890s, follows Nan King as she goes from naive Whistable oyster-girl to music-hall star to London rent boy to openly lesbian \u201ctom\u201d. Nan\u2019s coming out is gradual: she falls for male impersonator Kitty Butler as soon as she sees her on stage, but quickly realises she has to keep her feelings to herself. By the end of the novel, though, she embraces her sexuality. She takes her lover\u2019s hand in public, \u201cand \u2013 careless of whether anybody watched or not \u2013 I leaned in and kissed her\u201d.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/moab-is-my-washpot.html\">Moab Is My Washpot by Stephen Fry</a><br></strong>When I was 17, I fell horribly in love with a girl I\u2019d never spoken to. Then I read Fry\u2019s description of falling in love in the same way, and I felt much less alone. I underlined the passage in pencil, the way teenagers do: \u201cHow can it be that just the gait of him, the stand of him, the shape and turn away of him, can be enough for me to know and to know at once?\u2026 I wrote it down that first afternoon. <em>I love Matthew Osborne. </em>I instinctively knew this meant that everything was changed.\u201d</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/under-the-udala-trees-464670.html\">Under the Udala Trees by Chinelo Okparanta</a><br></strong>This debut novel tells the story of Ijeoma, who falls in love with another girl, Amina, during the Nigerian civil war. In Nigeria, anyone found guilty of having a same-sex relationship \u2013 or \u201csupporting\u201d a same-sex relationship \u2013 can be sentenced to 14 years in prison. In the northern states, the punishment is death by stoning. In her author\u2019s note, Okparanta writes: \u201cThis novel attempts to give Nigeria\u2019s marginalised LGBTQ citizens a more powerful voice, and a place in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0d60a78b7c14645cec06f0ea36824fdba72708b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0d60a78b7c14645cec06f0ea36824fdba72708b/0_54_2304_1382/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcus D\u2019Amico as Michael Tolliver in the TV adaptation of Tales of the City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Light and joy \u2026 Marcus D\u2019Amico as Michael Tolliver in the TV adaptation of Tales of the City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/more-tales-of-the-city.html\">More Tales of the City by Armistead Maupin</a><br></strong>This features one of the most iconic comings-out in queer literature: Michael Tolliver\u2019s Letter to Mama. \u201cIf you and Papa are responsible for the way I am, then I thank you with all my heart, for it\u2019s the light and joy of my life,\u201d he writes. The fictional letter helped Maupin come out to his own parents \u2013 he knew they would read it and realise. Eventually he received a reply from his father: \u201cDear Teddy, As you know, your mother is very ill, so any additional stress can only exacerbate the situation.\u201d</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/trans-531676.html\">Trans: A Memoir by Juliet Jacques</a><br></strong>This book grew out of Jacques\u2019 Guardian column, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/transgender-journey\">A Transgender Journey</a>, which documented her gender reassignment. Juliet comes out again and again, as she navigates her identity and the evolving language around gender identities. Some of the most touching passages are about Juliet\u2019s relationship with her mother. Shortly after her surgery, they go bra shopping together, and Juliet\u2019s mum refers to her as \u201cmy daughter\u201d in public. Jacques writes: \u201cNow I could see that she understood my transition as a process in which far more had been gained than lost.\u201d</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/when-katie-met-cassidy.html\">When Katie Met Cassidy by Camille Perri</a><br></strong>Everything I\u2019ve ever wanted in a Hollywood romcom, in book form. One of the \u201cleads\u201d is a gender non-conforming lesbian and the other is a outdoorsy girl from Kentucky who has never even considered dating another woman. Of course, it\u2019s Katie from Kentucky who comes out during the story. At first she\u2019s embarrassed to be seen with another woman in public, but she overcomes her shame \u2013 and like all good lesbians, Katie and Cassidy declare their love for each other 10 days after meeting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa58233ac7ffd9b168e1df4084f58fa2870866dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa58233ac7ffd9b168e1df4084f58fa2870866dc/228_975_740_365/500.jpg\" alt=\"Family secrets \u2026 a frame from Fun Home.\" width=\"500\" height=\"247\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Family secrets \u2026 a frame from Fun Home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Alison Bechdel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/16/biography.oliverburkeman\">Fun Home by Alison Bechdel</a><br></strong>Bechdel won <a href=\"https://www.macfound.org/fellows/908/\">a MacArthur \u201cgenius grant\u201d</a> for her pioneering graphic novel, which focuses on her difficult relationship with her father. Just four months after Alison came out as a lesbian \u2013 and her father admitted to having affairs with men \u2013 he killed himself. \u201cWith my father\u2019s death following so hard on the heels of this doleful coming-out party,\u201d she writes, \u201cI could not help assume a cause-and-effect relationship.\u201d</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/giovanni-s-room-9780141186351.html\">Giovanni\u2019s Room by James Baldwin</a><br></strong>Baldwin wrote this novel in the early 1950s, so it\u2019s not surprising that it falls into the \u201cbeing queer can lead to tragedy\u201d category of LGBTQ fiction. David, the protagonist, doesn\u2019t want to come out, to himself or anyone else. He proposes to his girlfriend, Hella, but then starts an affair with Giovanni, a young Italian waiter. At the end of the novel, when Hella discovers David with a sailor, he tells her: \u201cI wasn\u2019t lying to you \u2026 I was lying to myself.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/04/top-10-landmarks-in-gay-and-lesbian-literature\">Top 10 landmarks in gay and lesbian literature</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/untitled-murder-most-unladylike-7.html\">Death in the Spotlight by Robin Stevens</a><br></strong>The seventh book in Stevens\u2019 bestselling Murder Most Unladylike series, aimed at children aged 9-14.

The suspect happens to be a woman, and Daisy happens to be one of the best-loved characters in contemporary children\u2019s literature. I am so glad this book exists: Daisy is a queer heroine children will look up to, and Hazel is a brilliant role model for young allies.

      "bodyText": "Coming out is one of the most daunting things a queer person will have to do. My parents are very liberal, but I still felt sick when, aged 25, I realised I had to tell them I was a lesbian: it felt like too much information, as though I was announcing I liked it from behind. This was just the last in a series of comings-out. When I was 12, my friends read my diary and realised I had a crush on another girl. Soon afterwards, an actual boy kissed me on the cheek at his bar mitzvah and everyone forgot about the girl. Aged 14, I told a few people I was gay, but then I developed a crush on Eddie Izzard and decided I was bisexual. Finding another woman to be bisexual with seemed like a lot of effort, though, so I pretty much forgot about fancying women until I was in my 20s. Coming out never happens just once. First you have to acknowledge your sexuality or gender identity to yourself. Then you might tell your friends and family, add a rainbow flag to your Twitter bio, ostentatiously read Sarah Waters novels on the train, that sort of thing. But it doesn\u2019t end there. You\u2019ll come out over and over again for the rest of your life \u2013 to the new guy at work who asks whether you\u2019re married, to the family friend who assumes \u201cpartner\u201d means \u201cbusiness associate\u201d, and to the estate agent who thinks your wife is your daughter. (This has happened to me twice. Twice.) To me, being queer is an absolute gift, and that\u2019s reflected in my novel, In at the Deep End. It tells the story of Julia, who comes out in her mid-20s and is thrilled when she realises that queer culture is her culture \u2013 Dusty Springfield, But I\u2019m a Cheerleader, the colour pink, vegan food, all the best things \u2013 and throws herself into the life with gay abandon. Of course, the fight for LGBTQ equality is far from over, and being openly queer is a privilege that millions of people around the world don\u2019t enjoy, but I wanted to celebrate the sheer joy of finding your community and figuring out who you are. Here, in no particular order, are 10 very good books about coming out. 1. The Times I Knew I Was Gay by Eleanor Crewes In this charming, funny comic, Crewes traces the moments she realised she might be gay, from her holy communion to her first date with a woman. She describes the \u201cburst of life\u201d she feels when she comes out once and for all \u2013 and the regret that it has taken her so long. 2. Tipping the Velvet by Sarah Waters Waters\u2019 first novel, set in the 1890s, follows Nan King as she goes from naive Whistable oyster-girl to music-hall star to London rent boy to openly lesbian \u201ctom\u201d. Nan\u2019s coming out is gradual: she falls for male impersonator Kitty Butler as soon as she sees her on stage, but quickly realises she has to keep her feelings to herself. By the end of the novel, though, she embraces her sexuality. She takes her lover\u2019s hand in public, \u201cand \u2013 careless of whether anybody watched or not \u2013 I leaned in and kissed her\u201d. 3. Moab Is My Washpot by Stephen Fry When I was 17, I fell horribly in love with a girl I\u2019d never spoken to. Then I read Fry\u2019s description of falling in love in the same way, and I felt much less alone. I underlined the passage in pencil, the way teenagers do: \u201cHow can it be that just the gait of him, the stand of him, the shape and turn away of him, can be enough for me to know and to know at once?\u2026 I wrote it down that first afternoon. I love Matthew Osborne. I instinctively knew this meant that everything was changed.\u201d 4. Under the Udala Trees by Chinelo Okparanta This debut novel tells the story of Ijeoma, who falls in love with another girl, Amina, during the Nigerian civil war. In Nigeria, anyone found guilty of having a same-sex relationship \u2013 or \u201csupporting\u201d a same-sex relationship \u2013 can be sentenced to 14 years in prison. In the northern states, the punishment is death by stoning. In her author\u2019s note, Okparanta writes: \u201cThis novel attempts to give Nigeria\u2019s marginalised LGBTQ citizens a more powerful voice, and a place in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d 5. More Tales of the City by Armistead Maupin This features one of the most iconic comings-out in queer literature: Michael Tolliver\u2019s Letter to Mama. \u201cIf you and Papa are responsible for the way I am, then I thank you with all my heart, for it\u2019s the light and joy of my life,\u201d he writes. The fictional letter helped Maupin come out to his own parents \u2013 he knew they would read it and realise. Eventually he received a reply from his father: \u201cDear Teddy, As you know, your mother is very ill, so any additional stress can only exacerbate the situation.\u201d 6. Trans: A Memoir by Juliet Jacques This book grew out of Jacques\u2019 Guardian column, A Transgender Journey, which documented her gender reassignment. Juliet comes out again and again, as she navigates her identity and the evolving language around gender identities. Some of the most touching passages are about Juliet\u2019s relationship with her mother. Shortly after her surgery, they go bra shopping together, and Juliet\u2019s mum refers to her as \u201cmy daughter\u201d in public. Jacques writes: \u201cNow I could see that she understood my transition as a process in which far more had been gained than lost.\u201d 7. When Katie Met Cassidy by Camille Perri Everything I\u2019ve ever wanted in a Hollywood romcom, in book form. One of the \u201cleads\u201d is a gender non-conforming lesbian and the other is a outdoorsy girl from Kentucky who has never even considered dating another woman. Of course, it\u2019s Katie from Kentucky who comes out during the story. At first she\u2019s embarrassed to be seen with another woman in public, but she overcomes her shame \u2013 and like all good lesbians, Katie and Cassidy declare their love for each other 10 days after meeting. 8. Fun Home by Alison Bechdel Bechdel won a MacArthur \u201cgenius grant\u201d for her pioneering graphic novel, which focuses on her difficult relationship with her father. Just four months after Alison came out as a lesbian \u2013 and her father admitted to having affairs with men \u2013 he killed himself. \u201cWith my father\u2019s death following so hard on the heels of this doleful coming-out party,\u201d she writes, \u201cI could not help assume a cause-and-effect relationship.\u201d 9. Giovanni\u2019s Room by James Baldwin Baldwin wrote this novel in the early 1950s, so it\u2019s not surprising that it falls into the \u201cbeing queer can lead to tragedy\u201d category of LGBTQ fiction. David, the protagonist, doesn\u2019t want to come out, to himself or anyone else. He proposes to his girlfriend, Hella, but then starts an affair with Giovanni, a young Italian waiter. At the end of the novel, when Hella discovers David with a sailor, he tells her: \u201cI wasn\u2019t lying to you \u2026 I was lying to myself.\u201d 10. Death in the Spotlight by Robin Stevens The seventh book in Stevens\u2019 bestselling Murder Most Unladylike series, aimed at children aged 9-14. When an actress is murdered at a London theatre, amateur detectives Daisy and Hazel vow to find the culprit \u2013 but then Daisy falls for one of the suspects. The suspect happens to be a woman, and Daisy happens to be one of the best-loved characters in contemporary children\u2019s literature. I am so glad this book exists: Daisy is a queer heroine children will look up to, and Hazel is a brilliant role model for young allies. When Daisy tells her she likes girls, Hazel says: \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend and nothing you can do can change that.\u201d \u2022 In at the Deep End by Kate Davies is published by HarperCollins, priced \u00a312.99.

      "body": "<p><strong>\u201cWhen Newport played Manchester City in the FA Cup, it was the first time th</strong><strong>at the fixture ha</strong><strong>d been played for more than 56 years,\u201d</strong> writes Mark Meadowcroft. \u201c<strong>The last match, on 24 October 1962 (2-1 to City at Maine Road in the League Cup) was at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis and the week after Love Me Do first charted. Is there a longer gap between two meetings of the same opponents?\u201d</strong></p> <p>Yes there is, Mark. Our first suggestion comes from Simon Cook: \u201cArsenal played Brentford on 26 September 2018 in the League Cup, 71 years after their last meeting on 26 May 1947.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/13/is-tottenhams-run-of-30-league-games-without-a-draw-a-record\">Is Tottenham's run of 30 league games without a draw a record? | The Knowledge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But that can be topped. \u201cAs the oldest club in England still playing, Notts County have seen some opponents very infrequently,\u201d writes Alex Lyon. \u201cA quick look shows the longest gap between two matches is 109 years, with Kettering Town the opponents \u2013 the clubs have twice been drawn together in the FA Cup. The first match on 28 January 1899 was won by Notts County, but when they met again on 30 November 2008, the match was a draw and Kettering won the replay.\u201d</p> <p>But that can be topped. \u201cEven if you doubled Newport v City it wouldn\u2019t beat the gap between fixtures for Chorley and Stockport County,\u201d declared Gary Fairclough. \u201cBefore Stockport\u2019s 3-0 league defeat to Chorley in November 2014 the two sides had not played each other competitively for 114 years. Their last meeting was in 1900; Britain was in turmoil over the second Boer War and across Europe new football teams were taking their first steps in the game with strange names like Ajax, Lazio and Bayern Munich. They probably never amounted to much.\u201d</p> <p>But <em>that</em> can be topped. Here\u2019s Michael Knaggs: \u201cMy best guess is on 24 August 2016, Accrington beat Burnley 1-0 in the EFL Cup. It was their first competitive meeting since 1893, 123 years prior, when Victoria had eight years to go as Queen of the empire, Dvor\u00e1k\u2019s New World Symphony premi\u00e8red and Arthur Conan Doyle revealed that Sherlock Homes had died. If anyone can beat that, I tip my hat to them.\u201d</p> <p>Can anyone beat that?

He was clearly on the slide however; the following season he failed to beat his age, netting a meagre 31 goals.\u201d</p> <p>Here\u2019s more from Tim Dockery: \u201cEven at 39, Patrizia Panico was inducing panic among her opponents. When the 2013-14 season ended in Women\u2019s Serie A, she was the top scorer <a href=\"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A_2013-2014_(calcio_femminile)\">with 43 goals</a> for Associazione Sportiva Dilettantistica Torres Calcio Femminile.

Llanelli Town were promoted to the Welsh Football League Division One.\u201d</p> <h2>Knowledge archive</h2> <p><strong>\u201cHave any players ever used a corner flag, a goalpost or an advertising hoarding to attack an opponent?\u201d </strong>asked Pedro Salinas in 2007.</p> <p>Step forward Canada\u2019s Paul Peschisolido, duly picking up a red card for his troubles against El Salvador during a World Cup qualifier in 1997. \u201cI was kicked a few times and the referee wasn\u2019t giving anything, while every challenge we made seemed to result in a foul,\u201d he explained. \u201cI was getting very annoyed and frustrated so I decided to elbow one of their players. It was right in the corner and, in fact, I elbowed the corner flag into his face.\u201d</p> <p>Martin Keown managed the next best thing in January 2002, chucking a corner flag into the stands during Arsenal\u2019s 1-1 draw at Elland Road. Early in the game Keown conceded a corner; as he got up he grabbed the flag and casually lobbed it behind him into the front rows of fans. Despite uproar from the supporters, the FA eventually decided he had not intended to hit them, and did not enforce any punishment.</p> <p>Sadly there were no such exciting tales regarding advertising hoardings, though Rudy Hulsman was quick to remind us of the match between Orlando Pirates and Black Leopards in South Africa\u2019s Premier Soccer League. With the game in mid-flow, heavy winds suddenly <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=NIKdK-T-jZM\" title=\"\">sent a number of hoardings flying across the pitch</a>, taking out a linesman and several players in a matter of seconds.</p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theknowledge\">For thousands more questions and answers look through our archive</a>.</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Can you help?</h2> <p>\u201cNew Celtic loan signing Timothy Weah (son of George) was recently called up to the USMNT, likewise Jonathan Klinsmann (son of J\u00fcrgen), Shaq Moore (son of Trinidad and Tobago international Wendell), and Fafa Picault (grandson of Haiti international Max Antoine),\u201d writes Eddie Eyers. \u201cIs this the greatest collection of national team players whose forebears played for other nations?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/leemadden83/status/1097879059730780160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What\u2019s most games a team has lost in any given season and still won the domestic title, ie. who are the \u201cworst\u201d league winners.</p>&mdash; Lee Madden (@leemadden83) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/leemadden83/status/1097879059730780160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 19, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ARToothill/status/1097881240714256384\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Folkestone vs Wingate finished 2-2 at the weekend, it was 0-0 at 90 mins, has a higher scoring game ever happened with all goals in injury time?</p>&mdash; Andrew Toothill (@ARToothill) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ARToothill/status/1097881240714256384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 19, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cMaty Ryan claims that the penalty he gave away in Brighton\u2019s match against Burnley was the first <a href=\"https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/premier-league/socceroos-star-mat-ryan-fumes-over-penalty-against-burnley/news-story/c4f856cea79ce8776f4da090054d75c2\">he\u2019s ever given away</a>.

Our first suggestion comes from Simon Cook: \u201cArsenal played Brentford on 26 September 2018 in the League Cup, 71 years after their last meeting on 26 May 1947.\u201d But that can be topped. \u201cAs the oldest club in England still playing, Notts County have seen some opponents very infrequently,\u201d writes Alex Lyon. \u201cA quick look shows the longest gap between two matches is 109 years, with Kettering Town the opponents \u2013 the clubs have twice been drawn together in the FA Cup. The first match on 28 January 1899 was won by Notts County, but when they met again on 30 November 2008, the match was a draw and Kettering won the replay.\u201d But that can be topped. \u201cEven if you doubled Newport v City it wouldn\u2019t beat the gap between fixtures for Chorley and Stockport County,\u201d declared Gary Fairclough. \u201cBefore Stockport\u2019s 3-0 league defeat to Chorley in November 2014 the two sides had not played each other competitively for 114 years. Their last meeting was in 1900; Britain was in turmoil over the second Boer War and across Europe new football teams were taking their first steps in the game with strange names like Ajax, Lazio and Bayern Munich. They probably never amounted to much.\u201d But that can be topped. Here\u2019s Michael Knaggs: \u201cMy best guess is on 24 August 2016, Accrington beat Burnley 1-0 in the EFL Cup. It was their first competitive meeting since 1893, 123 years prior, when Victoria had eight years to go as Queen of the empire, Dvor\u00e1k\u2019s New World Symphony premi\u00e8red and Arthur Conan Doyle revealed that Sherlock Homes had died. If anyone can beat that, I tip my hat to them.\u201d Can anyone beat that? Email knowledge@theguardian.com. Seeing red after a hat-trick \u201cPlayers who have scored a hat-trick and got sent off during the same match,\u201d tweets Chris Bull, straight to the point. \u201cChris Iwelumo,\u201d replies James Flynn, pithily, in reference to the 2008 game in which the big man was one of two Wolves players dismissed in a spicy 3-1 win over Preston. But before being sent off (for sticking his nut on Sean St Ledger), Iwelumo bagged a treble to take his tally that season to eight goals in seven games. \u201cIn the 2001-02 Primeira Liga,\u201d offers Dirk Maas, \u201cFC Porto\u2019s Benni McCarthy completed his hat-trick in the 74th minute against Santa Clara, only to be red-carded six minutes later.\u201d And an example we dug out from close to home. Outscoring your age \u201cScott Dobbie of Queen of the South, age 36, had scored 37 goals by the end of January this season,\u201d explains David Forbes. \u201cWho is the oldest player to have outscored their age in a season?\u201d \u201cAt top level, the legendary Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s takes some beating,\u201d reckons David Warriston. \u201cBy the end of 1961-62, the Magyar maestro was 35 and had scored 40 goals for Real Madrid, including a first-half hat-trick in that year\u2019s European Cup final. He was clearly on the slide however; the following season he failed to beat his age, netting a meagre 31 goals.\u201d Here\u2019s more from Tim Dockery: \u201cEven at 39, Patrizia Panico was inducing panic among her opponents. When the 2013-14 season ended in Women\u2019s Serie A, she was the top scorer with 43 goals for Associazione Sportiva Dilettantistica Torres Calcio Femminile. During that time, she also scored four goals for Torres in cup competitions, bringing her total for the year to 47.\u201d Room for one more. \u201cLee Trundle scored 45 league goals in 23 appearances for Llanelli Town in 2016-17, when he turned 40,\u201d notes Dave Johnston. \u201cHe scored 53 in all competitions that season, in only 31 appearances. Llanelli Town were promoted to the Welsh Football League Division One.\u201d Knowledge archive \u201cHave any players ever used a corner flag, a goalpost or an advertising hoarding to attack an opponent?\u201d asked Pedro Salinas in 2007. Step forward Canada\u2019s Paul Peschisolido, duly picking up a red card for his troubles against El Salvador during a World Cup qualifier in 1997. \u201cI was kicked a few times and the referee wasn\u2019t giving anything, while every challenge we made seemed to result in a foul,\u201d he explained. \u201cI was getting very annoyed and frustrated so I decided to elbow one of their players. It was right in the corner and, in fact, I elbowed the corner flag into his face.\u201d Martin Keown managed the next best thing in January 2002, chucking a corner flag into the stands during Arsenal\u2019s 1-1 draw at Elland Road. Early in the game Keown conceded a corner; as he got up he grabbed the flag and casually lobbed it behind him into the front rows of fans. Despite uproar from the supporters, the FA eventually decided he had not intended to hit them, and did not enforce any punishment. Sadly there were no such exciting tales regarding advertising hoardings, though Rudy Hulsman was quick to remind us of the match between Orlando Pirates and Black Leopards in South Africa\u2019s Premier Soccer League. With the game in mid-flow, heavy winds suddenly sent a number of hoardings flying across the pitch, taking out a linesman and several players in a matter of seconds. \u2022 For thousands more questions and answers look through our archive. Can you help? \u201cNew Celtic loan signing Timothy Weah (son of George) was recently called up to the USMNT, likewise Jonathan Klinsmann (son of J\u00fcrgen), Shaq Moore (son of Trinidad and Tobago international Wendell), and Fafa Picault (grandson of Haiti international Max Antoine),\u201d writes Eddie Eyers. \u201cIs this the greatest collection of national team players whose forebears played for other nations?\u201d \u201cMaty Ryan claims that the penalty he gave away in Brighton\u2019s match against Burnley was the first he\u2019s ever given away. If true, that\u2019s quite impressive. Which goalkeeper holds the record for most games played without giving away a penalty?\u201d wonders Mike Raphael. \u201cWhile playing some magnificent Sporcle quizzes, I noticed that German defender Karl-Heinz Schnellinger received Ballon d\u2019Or votes in three consecutive years for work at four separate clubs: FC K\u00f6ln and AC Mantova in 1963, AC Mantova/AS Roma in 1964, and AS Roma/Milan in 1965, and Milan alone in 1966,\u201d writes Damian Bl\u00e4ttler. \u201cSurely this is the longest such streak? And has anyone received Ballon d\u2019Or votes at more clubs than this?\u201d Email your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.",

      "bodyText": "The World Golf Championships-Mexico Championship is an unlikely saviour for the sport. At the first staging of this tournament, in 2017, players and caddies were affected by sickness to such an extent that an emergency ward by the 18th green would have been a valid addition. The impact on last year was inevitable; Rory McIlroy gave the event a miss despite a $10m prize pot, as again did Jason Day. The tournament seen by many as a beacon of light, having prised WGC status away from the Donald Trump-owned Doral site in Miami, was floundering. Is it third time lucky? The early signs are at least promising. McIlroy will tee up at Chapultepec on Thursday. The resurgent Tiger Woods will do likewise, in what will prove a fascinating insight into interest in this sport\u2019s most famous player in unorthodox professional territory. That there is no cut means a guarantee of Woods for four rounds, useful to analysts and the 14-times major champion himself after the weather delays which disrupted last weekend\u2019s PGA Tour stop in Los Angeles. Whisper it but Augusta National is not so far away. The broader picture, even so early in the year and owing to a bizarre set of circumstances, is that golf could sorely do with some uplifting tales emanating from central America. In no particular order 2019 in golf has seen: murmurs of discontent or confusion relating to new rules; squabbles over slow play; negative publicity as the European Tour opted to stage an event in Saudi Arabia; the vilification of Sergio Garc\u00eda after damage done to greens in Saudi Arabia; and an epic rumpus involving what Matt Kuchar paid \u2013 or did not pay \u2013 a caddie. Individually these events are bothersome enough but, when taken collectively, they portray the image of a sport grasping for happy pills. This week, for the first time in a PGA Tour-sanctioned event, players are permitted to wear shorts for pro-am and practice rounds. A topic so trivial it is barely worthy of a shrug will attract attention as if delivering seismic change on the game. It is little wonder. Victory for JB Holmes on Sunday at the Genesis Open has not been assessed \u2013 externally anyway \u2013 without reference to his chronic pace of play. The antics of Holmes \u2013 procrastinating and pontificating, never ready when it is his turn to play \u2013 made this event unwatchable even to seasoned golf fans. Holmes shrugged his shoulders after walking off with a cheque for $1.3m. \u201cThere\u2019s times when I\u2019m probably slow but it is what it is,\u201d Holmes said. The inference was simple: \u201cI couldn\u2019t give a \u2026\u201d That the PGA Tour, a members\u2019 organisation, will not appropriately penalise serial slow-play offenders is hardly news. A key point with this will arrive, surely, only if those providing live broadcasts of events decide the product is being meaningfully harmed. Viewing figures for Sunday\u2019s final round would make interesting reading. Garc\u00eda\u2019s extraordinary episode in Saudi, a woefully ill-fated European Tour production, was followed by an apology which implicated personal circumstances. Whether the Spaniard\u2019s penalty starts and ends at disqualification from that event is apparently still a matter for discussion. So, too, is how badly Kuchar\u2019s reputation has been besmirched by his low-balling of a temporary caddie when he won the Mayakoba Classic in Playa del Carmen. As public relations blunders go, not least for a player commonly portrayed as more pure than the driven snow, this was incredible. Three months on, due in no small part to media attention, Kuchar\u2019s climbdown led to David Ortiz securing a payment of $50,000. Intriguingly, Kuchar is back in Mexico this week, where one presumes he will keep his head down.

But he is a pillar of Schalke\u2019s dressing room now, and those with an ear to the inside say he is an intelligent, increasingly influential voice in a squad that finished second in last season\u2019s Bundesliga but lost a leader upon the summer departure of Leon Goretzka for Bayern Munich.</p> <p>\u201cI started very young and, especially as a defender, it\u2019s hard to be on the highest level [at that age],\u201d he says. \u201cBut now I feel great and think the best years are ahead of me.\u201d He says he wants to help nurture Schalke\u2019s next generation, and one of them is the winger Rabbi Matondo, who joined from City in January and made his first Bundesliga start against Freiburg on Saturday. Matondo\u2019s maturity has made an impression at Schalke and Nastasic says he has got off to an exciting start, while joking about his youthful appearance. After this interview, the pair will meet up for an \u201cExplaining Schalke\u201d segment on the club\u2019s in-house television channel; Nastasic will be giving the lesson and he is confident that they can both contribute to an upset on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cI think everybody thinks it will be an easy game for City,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s no problem for us, we don\u2019t feel pressure.

His type of work is with a lot of aggression, a lot of tactics and, the most important thing for me, a lot of talk with the players.\u201d Perhaps a little more of that from Pellegrini would have benefited Nastasic at City. But he is a pillar of Schalke\u2019s dressing room now, and those with an ear to the inside say he is an intelligent, increasingly influential voice in a squad that finished second in last season\u2019s Bundesliga but lost a leader upon the summer departure of Leon Goretzka for Bayern Munich. \u201cI started very young and, especially as a defender, it\u2019s hard to be on the highest level [at that age],\u201d he says. \u201cBut now I feel great and think the best years are ahead of me.\u201d He says he wants to help nurture Schalke\u2019s next generation, and one of them is the winger Rabbi Matondo, who joined from City in January and made his first Bundesliga start against Freiburg on Saturday. Matondo\u2019s maturity has made an impression at Schalke and Nastasic says he has got off to an exciting start, while joking about his youthful appearance. After this interview, the pair will meet up for an \u201cExplaining Schalke\u201d segment on the club\u2019s in-house television channel; Nastasic will be giving the lesson and he is confident that they can both contribute to an upset on Wednesday. \u201cI think everybody thinks it will be an easy game for City,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s no problem for us, we don\u2019t feel pressure. We have a good opportunity to see where we are and show that we can fight and play good football against one of the best teams in Europe.\u201d",

We believe this is important so we are better placed to foster inclusivity, diversity, make space for debate and inspire conversation \u2013 so more people, across the world, have access to accurate information.</p> <p>We now have regular supporters in more than 145 countries around the world, enabling us to keep all our reporting available equally, without restriction. Each of these supporters is contributing financially in ways that work for them, and we are committed to providing our readers with a flexible and inclusive way to support us.</p> <h2>W<strong>ho owns the Guardian and how is it funded?</strong></h2> <p>The Guardian has no proprietor and just one shareholder, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust\">The Scott Trust</a>. This unique ownership structure has safeguarded our editorial independence since 1936, and means any profits we make are reinvested in our journalism. It also means that unlike other news organisations, we haven\u2019t put up a paywall, so we can keep our journalism accessible for everyone. But with print advertising revenues in decline and the majority of new digital advertising spend going by tech companies, we also need supporters, like you, who believe in the value of independent, investigative journalism. Your support is critical for the long-term sustainability of the Guardian.</p> <p>As our editor-in-chief <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2018/nov/12/katharine-viner-guardian-million-reader-funding\">Katharine Viner has said</a>, many readers have told us they give us money specifically because they want the Guardian to stay free, open and accessible to all, so that progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact - and to ensure that more people are more informed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2019/feb/20/katharine-viner-qanda-journalists-readers-guardian-future\">Q&amp;A with Katharine Viner: 'Journalists and readers share a vital stake in our future'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBeing supported by our readers is an opportunity to focus on what readers value in Guardian journalism: serious reporting that takes time and effort, carefully uncovers the facts, holds the powerful to account, and interrogates ideas and arguments \u2013 work that speaks to the urgency of the moment, but lasts for more than a day. Being funded by our readers means we must focus on the stories that are most meaningful.\u201d</p> <h2>What is the Guardian\u2019s editorial ethos?</h2> <p>In the last few years we have experienced a series of political and social shocks, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">EU referendum result</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">election of Donald Trump</a>, and what many believe is an unprecedented level of disruption to our planet, nation states, and communities.</p> <p>The support of our readers has enabled us to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2018/nov/14/million-guardian-journalists-reader-support-thanks\">pursue quality, investigative journalism</a> which has resulted in huge global scoops such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">Cambridge Analytica</a> and Facebook scandal \u2013 uncovered by Carole Cadwalladr, who writes for our sister paper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/observer\">the Observer</a> \u2013 and about the use of people\u2019s data in political campaigns. In addition, Amelia Gentleman\u2019s 2018 revelations of the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\"> Windrush scandal</a> gave a voice to the Commonwealth citizens who were in the UK for decades but subjected to terrible indignities because they had no paperwork.</p> <p>We have also continued to build on the Guardian\u2019s proud tradition of progressive journalism by increasing our focus on the environment, committing to reporting on inequality, exposing offshore tax avoidance through both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\">Panama Papers</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/paradise-papers\">Paradise Papers</a>, and investigating the behaviour and employment practices of corporations in a globalised world.</p> <h2><strong>Why should you support us?</strong></h2> <p>By supporting us you can become part of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/series/one-million-milestone\">global community of Guardian readers</a> with a shared set of values and a vision for a more hopeful world.

      "bodyText": "Why our readers\u2019 support has allowed the Guardian to embrace a new model for independent journalism In the last year, Guardian journalism has reached record numbers around the world and more than a million people have supported our work financially. This has resulted in our new model for open, independent journalism which is available to everyone and funded by our readers. It has been inspiring to see the positive response from so many of you, but our work is just beginning. Our supporters tell us that they deeply value the approach we have chosen \u2013 where everyone can access our journalism, regardless of where they live, what they earn, or how they like to consume the news. We believe this is important so we are better placed to foster inclusivity, diversity, make space for debate and inspire conversation \u2013 so more people, across the world, have access to accurate information. We now have regular supporters in more than 145 countries around the world, enabling us to keep all our reporting available equally, without restriction. Each of these supporters is contributing financially in ways that work for them, and we are committed to providing our readers with a flexible and inclusive way to support us. Who owns the Guardian and how is it funded? The Guardian has no proprietor and just one shareholder, The Scott Trust. This unique ownership structure has safeguarded our editorial independence since 1936, and means any profits we make are reinvested in our journalism. It also means that unlike other news organisations, we haven\u2019t put up a paywall, so we can keep our journalism accessible for everyone. But with print advertising revenues in decline and the majority of new digital advertising spend going by tech companies, we also need supporters, like you, who believe in the value of independent, investigative journalism. Your support is critical for the long-term sustainability of the Guardian. As our editor-in-chief Katharine Viner has said, many readers have told us they give us money specifically because they want the Guardian to stay free, open and accessible to all, so that progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact - and to ensure that more people are more informed. \u201cBeing supported by our readers is an opportunity to focus on what readers value in Guardian journalism: serious reporting that takes time and effort, carefully uncovers the facts, holds the powerful to account, and interrogates ideas and arguments \u2013 work that speaks to the urgency of the moment, but lasts for more than a day. Being funded by our readers means we must focus on the stories that are most meaningful.\u201d What is the Guardian\u2019s editorial ethos? In the last few years we have experienced a series of political and social shocks, from the EU referendum result to the election of Donald Trump, and what many believe is an unprecedented level of disruption to our planet, nation states, and communities. The support of our readers has enabled us to pursue quality, investigative journalism which has resulted in huge global scoops such as the Cambridge Analytica and Facebook scandal \u2013 uncovered by Carole Cadwalladr, who writes for our sister paper the Observer \u2013 and about the use of people\u2019s data in political campaigns. In addition, Amelia Gentleman\u2019s 2018 revelations of the Windrush scandal gave a voice to the Commonwealth citizens who were in the UK for decades but subjected to terrible indignities because they had no paperwork. We have also continued to build on the Guardian\u2019s proud tradition of progressive journalism by increasing our focus on the environment, committing to reporting on inequality, exposing offshore tax avoidance through both the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers, and investigating the behaviour and employment practices of corporations in a globalised world. Why should you support us? By supporting us you can become part of a global community of Guardian readers with a shared set of values and a vision for a more hopeful world. At a time when the media is concentrated in just a handful of powerful companies, the financial commitment from our readers is vital to maintaining our independent journalism in perpetuity. We are proving that our transformational approach is sustainable. We still have a long way to go, but are hugely heartened and emboldened by the response so far, which demonstrates a deep care by readers across the globe for the safeguarding of Guardian journalism. For those who want to support us, there are many different ways, through making a single or recurring contribution, by becoming a Patron, by subscribing to our weekly news magazine Guardian Weekly, or our new premium app and of course buying or subscribing to the Guardian and Observer newspapers. We believe, through the support of our readers, that we have a profound opportunity to connect with each other and experience \u2013 first hand \u2013 the stories that are shaping all of our lives, and to collaborate as we work towards a better, more informed future. At the Guardian, we are committed to holding the powerful to account and covering stories that would otherwise be ignored, and, we hope, helping to build a fairer world.

A Lords committee at the weekend said it believed the UK was narrowly on the wrong side of humanitarian law by selling arms to Saudi Arabia for use in the civil war in Yemen.

Hunt also wrote that the German government\u2019s decision to halt arms exports to Saudi Arabia would cost German defence firms \u20ac2.3bn (\u00a32bn) in revenues by 2026.

      "bodyText": "More than 2.5 million Australians have opted out of the My Health Record system, new figures show. The figures, revealed in Senate estimates on Wednesday, show almost one in 10 Australians eligible for Medicare have opted out of the controversial system. The My Health Record\u2019s opt-out period expired in late January, an extension of three months from the government\u2019s previous planned date of 31 October. About 1.4 million people opted out in those three months. Senate estimates also heard about 23.2 million Australians are now signed up to the system. A further 300,000 people had cancelled their records, estimates heard. People can continue to cancel their My Health Record, despite the opt-out period finishing. Health bureaucrats said the opt-out result was largely in line with expectations. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much where we\u2019ve landed: 90% of active Medicare users in Australia have not opted out,\u201d the department\u2019s deputy secretary, Caroline Edwards, said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll have My Health Records for 90% of Australians, for people with Medicare access.\u201d The My Health Record system is designed to allow information about patients to be shared between health providers, allowing continuity and better care. But the roll-out has attracted significant scrutiny. Privacy and security fears were raised about the system, and glitches also prevented some healthcare providers uploading clinical documents to the system. Labor\u2019s shadow health minister, Catherine King, said the opt-out rate was a dramatic increase on the 1.15 million who had opted out of the system before the original planned end date. \u201cThe government\u2019s rushed implementation of an opt-out model created a range of problems and severely undermined public support for a system that could deliver enormous health benefits for all Australians,\u201d she said. Health bureaucrats also said a technical glitch affecting the system, which prevented clinical providers uploading information, had largely been resolved. The problem only \u201ccurrently affects one-third of 1% of documents attempting to be uploaded\u201d, estimates heard. Guardian Australia revealed the existence of an internal briefing late last year that described the issue as \u201csignificant\u201d, said it had been escalated to the minister, and was still not fully resolved. The problem, the briefing said, threatened to leave patients\u2019 information incomplete or out-of-date.",

      "bodyText": "Three Green MEPs \u2013 including one from the UK \u2013 have been arrested after breaking into a Belgian military airbase to protest against its stockpiling of American B61 nuclear bombs. The MEPs \u2013 Molly Scott Cato, Mich\u00e8le Rivasi and Tilly Metz \u2013 unfurled a banner on a runway for F-16 fighter jets at the Kleine Brogel base in the east of the country calling for a nuclear-free Europe, before being taken into custody. Another Green MEP, Thomas Waitz, was arrested in a demonstration outside the base, along with 11 other activists from the Belgian peace group Agir pour la Paix (Act for Peace), three of whom also scaled a 3.5-metre fence to get into the base. The direct action protest follows the US withdrawal from the intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) treaty earlier this month. About 150 US nuclear weapons are thought to be scattered across Europe in Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, compared with more than 7,000 at the peak of the cold war. But campaigners fear this number could rapidly rise in any new arms race, and say each B61 has an explosive yield of up to 340 kilotons, 23 times more powerful than the bomb that devastated Hiroshima. On Tuesday, Scott Cato, the MEP for South West England, told the Guardian that the protest would be \u201ca balance of risks and purposes\u201d. She said: \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about the potential end of the world, your own personal safety is put into perspective \u2013 and we are talking about weapons that could kill millions of people.\u201d \u201cNuclear weapons offer no solution in this era and no rationale for defending the people in the south-west who I represent, one of whom died this year because of a Russian secret forces attack. How are nuclear weapons supposed to help Dawn Sturgess?\u201d she said, referring to the woman police believe was killed by novichok in Amesbury, Wiltshire last year. MEPs in Brussels enjoy some immunity from prosecution but it is unclear if this would cover state security laws, which carry potential five-year prison sentences. Mich\u00e8le Rivasi, the vice-chair of the Green party in the European parliamentsaid on Tuesday that: \u201c\u201cWe are demanding the withdrawal of nuclear bombs at Kleine Brogel and also from Italy, Germany and the Netherlands. We urge all EU member states to sign and ratify the treaty prohibiting nuclear weapons. Our first objective is a Europe without nuclear arms.\u201d.\u201d Only 21 nations have ratified a 2017 UN treaty prohibiting nuclear weapons. Of the EU countries, only Austria has signed up, although Ireland may soon follow. The nuclear shadow over Europe has loomed large across Europe in the last year, after Russia\u2019s deployment of Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad, Germany\u2019s exploration of nuclearisation and France\u2019s flexing of its nuclear muscle, as Brexit approaches. Green party sources say Wednesday\u2019s action was, in part, an effort to set the political agenda before elections in Belgium \u2013 where the Greens top opinion polls \u2013 and across northern Europe, where they are riding high.",

      "bodyText": "Government guidelines aimed at promoting more diversity in South Korea\u2019s K-pop world have been withdrawn after critics said they amounted to state censorship of a booming industry. The guidelines issued last week by the ministry of gender equality and family complained that K-pop stars looked too alike, saying \u201cthe problem of \u2026 uniformity among singers is serious\u201d, and noting most idols were thin and wore identical makeup and skimpy outfits. The paragraphs that caused offence advised restricting the number of K-pop singers who appear on a TV show, for fear that similar appearances may promote unrealistic and narrow standards of beauty. \u201cAre the singers on TV music shows twins? They seriously look identical. Most are idol group members,\u201d the guidelines say, according to the Korea Times. \u201cMost of them are skinny and have similar hairstyles and makeup with outfits exposing their bodies.\u201d A petition was submitted to the Korean government calling for the ministry\u2019s abolition on the grounds that it was trying to censor \u201chow female pop stars look\u201d, reported the Korea JoongAng Daily. The petition said the ministry was going \u201cdown the path of [dictator] Chun Doo-hwan, starting with internet censorship and now appearance censorship\u201d. Comparisons with the dictator, who ruled South Korea from 1980-1988, were also drawn by opposition politicians, including Ha Tae-keung of the minor opposition Bareunmirae party, reported the Korea Times. \u201cThe gender ministry says K-pop idols should not star together on television because they are all skinny and pretty with pale skin,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between this and the crackdowns on the length of hair and skirts during the military dictatorship of Chun Doo-hwan?\u201d The government said the guidelines were not mandatory but were aimed at addressing the negative impact of unrealistic beauty standards. But after criticism, the ministry said on Tuesday it would withdraw the recommendation after it had \u201ccaused unnecessary confusion\u201d. It claimed it had neither the intention nor authority to control TV production and it had simply tried to \u201cprevent media, which has big influence on people\u2019s daily life, from undermining human rights or fostering discrimination unintentionally\u201d. South Korea is famous for its cosmetic surgery industry, with as many as one third of young women in the country believed to have gone under the knife. In 2017 all four members of the K-pop band SixBomb went through extensive plastic surgery, including nose jobsand breast implants, before releasing a single. A series of videos showed the four women visiting a clinic, strutting into an operating theatre and lying on the operating table. Last year, South Korean women began a social media movement reacting against the country\u2019s culture of exacting beauty standards, which suggested women engage in cosmetic surgery and laborious multi-step skin care regimes. The movement, called Escape the Corset, saw Korean women post makeup-free selfies and videos of themselves destroying their makeup, in a rebellion against beauty norms.

      "bodyText": "Michaelia Cash has been accused of showing \u201cno shame\u201d for refusing to speak to police about the leak to media from her office of raids on the Australian Workers\u2019 Union headquarters. The Labor senator Penny Wong made the accusation after two gruelling Senate estimates sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday revealed that Cash\u2019s legal representation in the AWU\u2019s federal court case has cost taxpayers $289,000 while the Registered Organisations Commission has incurred $550,000. Cash refused to apologise for not answering police questions despite prosecutors saying lack of evidence was behind the decision not to press charges. Cash even demanded an apology from Labor senators. On 25 October 2017 Cash, then employment minister, was forced to correct her evidence to Senate estimates, in which she claimed the leak had not come from her office, when her senior media adviser, David De Garis, admitted that he had tipped the media off about the imminent federal police raids on the AWU headquarters. Last week, De Garis gave evidence to the federal court that he had learned of the raids from Cash\u2019s former chief of staff Ben Davies, who in turn said he learned of the raids from the Registered Organisations Commission\u2019s stand-in media adviser, Mark Lee, while the pair made arrangements for Lee to take a new job in Cash\u2019s office. The court case also drew then justice minister Michael Keenan\u2019s office into the controversy, when De Garis said he worked with Keenan\u2019s former media adviser, Michael Tetlow, to tell the media about the raids. On Wednesday Cash refused to comment on the revelations or further correct her evidence, claiming she could not verify them without a \u201ccertified transcript\u201d of the court proceedings. The Labor senator, Doug Cameron, asked if Cash was aware of the alleged \u201ccriminal leaking\u201d from her office. In response, Cash repeated her evidence to the federal court on Friday that she \u201chad no prior knowledge of the raids, of the execution of warrants\u201d. On Tuesday evening Cash said that on \u201cnumerous occasions\u201d Wong and other Labor senators had suggested she had prior knowledge of the raids, and said she is \u201cwaiting for an apology\u201d. Cash objected to Cameron\u2019s \u201cloose language\u201d, noting that the police investigation had been closed and there are no criminal proceedings afoot. On Tuesday the commonwealth director of public prosecutions gave evidence it had not proceeded with charges, not because it didn\u2019t believe a crime had been committed but because of a lack of evidence. On Monday the AFP said they had formed the view while investigating the leaks that evidence \u201cmay have been destroyed\u201d. In court hearings last week De Garis said he had deleted three text messages he exchanged with a colleague in Keenan\u2019s office about the raids before handing in his phone. Labor senators quizzed the small business minister about evidence from the Australian federal police to Senate estimates on Monday that Cash and Keenan twice declined to be interviewed and although both provided written material, neither had given a \u201cwitness statement\u201d. Cash said the AFP asked her to provide a statement five months after the raids. She responded that her \u201cbest recollection\u201d was contained in her contemporaneous account to estimates in October 2017, so she provided the police a copy of Hansard which she variously described as \u201ca statement\u201d and \u201ca voluntary statement\u201d. \u201cAt no time after the statement was provided \u2026 did the AFP ask further questions or say it was in any way insufficient,\u201d she said. Senator Derryn Hinch criticised Cash\u2019s evidence, suggesting it \u201csounds like a round robin\u201d because Cash had told Senate estimates that she couldn\u2019t answer questions because the AWU raid leak matter is before the courts and told police she had given her evidence to Senate estimates. Cash responded that she had \u201cactually answered copious questions\u201d in Senate estimates, although she has repeatedly invoked public interest immunity to deflect questions since the matter was referred to police on 27 October 2017. Cash went on the counter-attack, reminding Senate estimates on Tuesday evening and Wednesday afternoon that police raided the AWU because they were investigating whether the union had proper authorisation when it made a $100,000 donation to GetUp and a $25,000 donation to Bill Shorten in 2005. The Registered Organisation Commission initiated the investigation after a letter from Cash, but the minister has denied referring the matter to damage Shorten. On Wednesday, department officials told estimates that the attorney general had approved taxpayer funding for Cash\u2019s costs in the AWU federal court case, in which the union aims to show the raids were unlawful. So far, Cash\u2019s legal bills have cost taxpayers $288,812. At a press conference on Wednesday, Wong said that Cash\u2019s evidence was \u201cquite extraordinary\u201d. Wong said she is \u201cdeeply offended\u201d that members of ministerial staff could \u201ctry and utilise the instruments of state to pursue a political opponent\u201d. \u201cThat she could turn up to estimates and simply try and again turn this into some political attack \u2013 [displaying] no shame\u2026 is extraordinary.\u201d",

Johns answered: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Well, we have an update, courtesy of estimates.</p> \n  <p><strong>Jenny McAllister</strong>: Dr Johns, the last time you appeared before this committee we had a conversation about acknowledgment of country. Subsequent to the exchange that we had, I understand that the Minister for Indigenous Affairs wrote to you and reassured you directly, saying \u201cI do not believe that such an inference could be drawn from such references in the signature blocks of ACNC officers.\u201d </p> \n  <p>So it must have been something of a relief to realise that you can acknowledge country without creating a perception of bias.</p> \n  <p>Did you respond to Mr Scullion \u2013 Senator Scullion I should say?</p> \n  <p><strong>Gary Johns</strong>: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Yes, and I made it clear that the decision of bias is mine - the question is whether I consider it an issue on my signature block in my commission. So the Senator\u2019s view does not carry any weight in my decision.</p> \n   <p>Sorry, it might be a useful piece of information, but it\u2019s not determinative of my view.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>JM: So your evidence to this committee is that the Minister for Indigenous Affairs\u2019 view<br>about this matter carries no weight with you?</p> \n  <p>GJ: It\u2019s not determinative; it\u2019s

It\u2019s a very, very Liberal scandal. And what we\u2019ve seen today \u2013 what we\u2019ve seen today in this House is the alternative universe that those opposite inhabit.</p> \n   <p>The alternative universe where it\u2019s entirely normal, when you want to book the 3.30 flight out of Perth you ring up the CEO of an ASX-listed company. That\u2019s the alternative universe they live in. The alternative universe when you don\u2019t actually notice when somebody picks up a $3,000 tab for you. </p> \n   <p>You haven\u2019t noticed it comes out of your credit card. The alternative universe those opposite occupy where there is one set of rules for their rich Liberal party mates and another set of rules for ordinary Australians and communities that we represent right around this country. </p> \n   <p>Now there are so many things today, Mr Speaker, that the prime minister and his sidekick, his offsider, the member for Sturt, were unable to explain. </p> \n   <p>So many things they were unable to explain. They couldn\u2019t provide a simple answer to a simple question about whether the documents which prove that Mr Hockey asked one of the embassy officials to take a meeting with a company \u2013 the company at the centre of this scandal \u2013 whether or not that document exists, and when the member for Sturt was asked about this, he basically told the House, \u2018Look, when we get around to checking it out, we\u2019ll see how we go.\u2019 Well, that\u2019s not good enough. </p> \n   <p>That\u2019s not good enough \u2013 the Australian people deserve answers about this latest grubby scandal which is engulfing the government which sits opposite \u2013 opposite from us today.</p> \n   <p>...

Now, this is a very serious issue here, this is a very serious issue.</p> \n   <p> The prime minister is denying something ... of which there are reports of documents which exist from officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. That is a very, very serious matter, Mr Speaker, and that\u2019s why we need to suspend standing orders to get to the bottom of these very, very important issues.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-20T04:28:21.671Z\">at 4.28am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c6cd1aee4b0793c8d0b25da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-20T04:07:08.915Z\">4.07am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jim Chalmers </strong>is attempting to move this motion:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I seek leave to move the following motion \u2013 that the House, </p> \n   <p>one, notes that yesterday it was revealed the finance minister received free flights to Singapore from Helloworld, which he booked by calling the CEO of this ASX-listed company directly, just before it was awarded a multimillion-dollar whole-of-government contract by the minister\u2019s own department, </p> \n   <p>(b) today, it has been reported that US ambassador <strong>Joe Hockey</strong>, who has a million-dollar shareholding in Helloworld, helped a Helloworld subsidiary lobby for the embassy\u2019s travel contract, </p> \n   <p>(c) the CEO of Helloworld and one of its largest shareholders, <strong>Andrew Burnes</strong>, is a Liberal party heavyweight and currently Liberal party treasurer with connections to a number of Liberal party politicians, </p> \n   <p>(d) the finance minister told Senate estimates yesterday that he had \u201ca close personal relationship\u201d with Mr Burnes, </p> \n   <p>(e) Mr Burnes was previously a colleague of the now-prime minister during the prime minister\u2019s time at Tourism Australia, </p> \n   <p>(f) since being awarded government contracts, the share price of Helloworld has skyrocketed, making shareholders like Mr Hockey and Mr Burns rich, </p> \n   <p>and (g) it was reported that the Herald Sun asked almost all of the 82 Liberal MPs in parliament whether they had received free travel from Helloworld, but only 14 said that they had not, </p> \n   <p>and, (2) therefore calls on the prime minister to investigate and report to the House how far this Helloworld scandal reaches into his government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He is denied on the voices. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-20T04:19:43.164Z\">at 4.19am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c6cd0afe4b079bb67ae378f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-20T04:01:57.398Z\">4.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jim Chalmers </strong>with the <strong>Nick Champion</strong> question (just cut down) to <strong>Scott Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>Is the prime minister confident that trips like the one by the minister for home affairs and <strong>Joe Hockey</strong> with Helloworld\u2019s CEO and Liberal treasurer Mr <strong>Andrew Burnes</strong> to Las Vegas, were paid at the full commercial rate?<br></p> \n  <p>Morrison:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Again, Mr Speaker, the member comes here and just makes assertions ...</p> \n   <p>He makes ... and then he asks me to respond as if those assertions are true, Mr Speaker.

the military applications of US capabilities in Australia or their contributions to intelligence matters, these capabilities also play a crucial role in our everyday lives.</p> \n   <p>In 2017, a new space surveillance radar reached full operational capability at the Harold E Holt facility.</p> \n   <p>This radar serves as a dedicated sensor node in the Global Space Surveillance Network, in

Schedule 2 of the bill makes amendments to improve the operation of the continuing detention order (CDO) scheme.

In the meantime, take care of you. Remember this story from Calla? Labor has called on the Indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, to investigate the \u201coffensive\u201d views of the charities commissioner, Gary Johns, after the former Labor MP refused to back away from past comments that pregnant Indigenous women were being used as \u201ccash cows\u201d. Johns, a minister in the Keating government, told a Senate estimates hearing this week that he had questioned his staff over the inclusion of an acknowledgement of traditional owners in their email signature, saying it could suggest the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission had a \u201cbias\u201d towards Indigenous charities. Labor senator Jenny McAllister asked Johns if his own past statements \u2013 which included a comment on the Bolt Report in 2015 that Indigenous women were being \u201ckept pregnant and producing children for the cash\u201d \u2013 could be taken to suggest that he had a negative bias toward Indigenous charities, and whether he disavowed those statements now. Johns answered: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\u201d Well, we have an update, courtesy of estimates. Jenny McAllister: Dr Johns, the last time you appeared before this committee we had a conversation about acknowledgment of country. Subsequent to the exchange that we had, I understand that the Minister for Indigenous Affairs wrote to you and reassured you directly, saying \u201cI do not believe that such an inference could be drawn from such references in the signature blocks of ACNC officers.\u201d So it must have been something of a relief to realise that you can acknowledge country without creating a perception of bias. Did you respond to Mr Scullion \u2013 Senator Scullion I should say? Gary Johns: Yes, and I made it clear that the decision of bias is mine - the question is whether I consider it an issue on my signature block in my commission. So the Senator\u2019s view does not carry any weight in my decision. Sorry, it might be a useful piece of information, but it\u2019s not determinative of my view. JM: So your evidence to this committee is that the Minister for Indigenous Affairs\u2019 view about this matter carries no weight with you? GJ: It\u2019s not determinative; it\u2019s my view that carries the issue of whether I consider the particular form of acknowledgment to carry with it the risk of perceived bias. All of the hugs The Defence department has confirmed it no longer pays taxpayer dollars to social media influencers. The Herald Sun reported on Wednesday that swimmer Lachlan Carter was one of 14 social media influencers who were paid a total of $54,908 by the department in the past two years. Carter was spruiking the Navy\u2019s Young Endeavour sailing program with instagram hashtags like: #hotguys and #sixpackvibes. Under questioning from Labor senator Kimberley Kitching, Defence officials told a Senate estimates hearing the department stopped using influencers in August last year. An official said the decision coincided with a discovery that two influencers used as part of a defence force recruiting campaign \u201cwere not aligned with Defence values\u201d. Anthony Albanese takes to the despatch box to thank Kelly O\u2019Dwyer for her speech and her contribution to the parliament, on behalf of the Labor party, and says he wants to acknowledge the sacrifice she has made, to her family, in order to be able to serve as a MP and minister. Catherine King on the number of opt-outs in MyHealth: Under Labor questioning in Senate estimates on Wednesday, the Australian Digital Health Agency revealed 2,517,921 opted out of the system before the end of January. And that figure doesn\u2019t include an estimated 300,000 others who had records but cancelled them. That\u2019s a dramatic increase on the 1,147,000 figure the Agency revealed in October \u2013 showing 1.4 million Australians scrambled to opt out after the government\u2019s original planned end date. Labor supports a national digital health record \u2013 which is why we created one when we were last in government. But the government\u2019s rushed implementation of an opt-out model created a range of problems and severely undermined public support for a system that could deliver enormous health benefits for all Australians.\u201d She concludes with: I want to thank my colleagues, including a number who I have worked with across the aisle, and in particular Julie Bishop for her friendship and guidance. I am lucky that before I came into this place I had two life-long friends who were already here \u2013 the speaker of the house, Tony Smith, and the president of the Senate, Scott Ryan \u2013 who are like big brothers to me, and like big brothers can both delight and infuriate me. I want to place on record my thanks to Malcolm Turnbull for his friendship and also his great support of me when I gave birth \u2013 the first serving Cabinet Minister to do so. He also made me the youngest female cabinet minister and, together with Scott Morrison, gave me portfolios with complex policy issues to work through. I have loved the intellectual stimulation and technical detail that has come with the second largest legislative workload in this place. I would like to place on record my gratitude to the many hard-working public servants in my various portfolios and the teams of people who enable our Parliament to function. To the prime minister, thank you for your friendship, determination, courage and leadership. It has never been more needed than now and I know that with you our country is in good hands. I thank the house for its indulgence.\u201d Kelly O\u2019Dwyer uses her final speech to back a call from Scott Ryan: As my final observation in this place, I think that elected governments should be able to implement their mandates. I support the proposition endorsed by the Senate president for major parties to consider implementing an Australian version of the Salisbury Convention. This would mean parties agreeing to abide by a convention that the Senate won\u2019t obstruct the passage of legislation to effect government policy which has been fully and fairly disclosed to the Australian people well before voting commences in an election.\u201d Sarah Hanson-Young looks like she is in the chamber to hear Kelly O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s speech. A lot of Labor and the crossbench have stayed. And while there are more government MPs then there was for Jenny Macklin, there are still a lot of empty chairs for a minister delivering her valedictory. Looks like Health estimates is getting some updates on how many people have opted out of MyHealth. It might be easier to count those who are left. Kelly O\u2019Dwyer: My time in this place has coincided with a deterioration of trust in both this institution and, indeed, the very concept of democracy. Social media, and a proliferation of tribal echo chambers, have led to warped perceptions of Australians\u2019 views, a failure to listen to alternative ideas and a decline in genuine policy debate an civil discourse. Time spent in the community is the best antidote. However technology has accelerated our lives and our expectations. Complex policy issues in an increasingly complex world don\u2019t usually have an easy answer. The default response here should not be to immediately outsource decision making to unelected people. And sometimes parliamentarians need to prosecute the case for patience and a deeper conversation with their electorates.\u201d Kelly O\u2019Dwyer begins her valedictory speech. I start today with the words that concluded my very first speech in this place: \u2018I will never forget that politics is about people. And that people can make a difference. That is why I am here. I look forward to playing my part in building an even better Australia.\u2019 Going on a decade as the Federal Member for Higgins, I believe that I have been able to do that. As anyone who has had the honour of serving in this place knows, you can\u2019t make a contribution here without a lot of support. I want to start by thanking the people of Higgins for the privilege of representing them in this place and for entrusting me to represent their issues both big and small. I especially want to thank them for giving me the opportunity to share in the important moments in their lives, and those of their families. I also want to thank the extraordinary members of the Liberal party. I joined the party as a 17 year old because I believe people should be free to choose their own paths in life, that they should be rewarded for hard work and enterprise, and that everyone, regardless of background or circumstance, deserves respect and the opportunity to live their best life. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to prosecute those values in this place.\u201d Jenny Macklin finishes with love: My first vote was in 1974 \u2013 for Gough and for Labor. I couldn\u2019t vote in the 1972 \u201cIt\u2019s Time\u201d election, because 18 year olds weren\u2019t allowed to vote back then \u2013 though Gough would change that. But I do remember being swept up in the energy and urgency of that election \u2013 the infectious feeling that change was finally coming. Gough said, \u201cIt\u2019s time\u201d \u2013 and it was. And now \u201cIt\u2019s time\u201d for me. Time to move on. Time to step back. Time for this new generation of brilliant people to make their impact \u2013 as I know you will. There is nothing wrong with having a big heart in politics. Seriously there is nothing wrong at all with having a big heart. There are people who really need us, who really need on us. Heed the words of Martin Luther King: \u201cPower without love is reckless and abusive, and love without power is sentimental and anaemic. \u201cPower at its best is love implementing the demands of justice, and justice at its best is power correcting everything that stands against love.\u201d Jenny Macklin also thanks the Coalition: I should say something about those opposite. It doesn\u2019t happen often, but when we find a common cause, it\u2019s important and impactful. What an amazing day it was when we all voted together for the National Disability Insurance Scheme.\u201d As with Wayne Swan\u2019s speech yesterday, there is barely anyone on the government benches to hear this speech. There may be a couple more in the hook, but I count less than 12. As predicted (by her) Jenny Macklin tears up, as she talks about the people she has met, before turning to her thankyous: Tanya Plibersek \u2013 much younger than me, from a different generation. And Wayne Swan, from the Queensland Right \u2013 practically another planet. I am originally a Queenslander so it must be that! But both so special to me. I thank them for their friendship. Also Anthony Albanese, who has always had my back. And Linda Burney, who has the biggest heart. Tony Burke, as the leader of opposition business, who has kept me on the tactics committee longer than anyone should. As well as our leaders, it\u2019s our whips who keep us all together. Chris Hayes is a true gentleman of politics, whose only failing of leadership has been his decision to appoint me as captain of our parliamentary swimming team. In all this time we\u2019ve only beaten the Coalition swimmers once, and that\u2019s only thanks to Matt Thistlethwaite, and we\u2019ve never beaten the Press Gallery team. Chris and I have spent many hours with our arms around our colleagues when they needed professional and personal support. That\u2019s something that people don\u2019t see. There is just so much about this place that people don\u2019t see. There have been many speakers in my time here, and a few unusual ones. You, Mr Speaker, have been far too patient with me when I\u2019m being cheeky or shouting something inappropriate. To you, and all the staff of the Parliament, my thanks. The dozens and dozens of staff I\u2019ve had over the years have been renowned for their kindness, their brilliance, their commitment to Labor values, and \u2026 their incredible fertility.\u201d If you are wondering what happened to the Michaelia Cash estimates updates, the committee has moved on to the spending of the department. Jenny Macklin is delivering her valedictory speech, after 23 years in parliament. To her colleagues she says: You are the custodians of our democracy now. And our democracy really must be nurtured. In my first speech I spoke about citizenship. I said it wasn\u2019t just about having a vote or holding a passport. It means being able to share in the life of the community. It means enjoying a certain level of security. It means belonging. The truth is, we need each other. We need to look out for each other, protect each other, and protect the institutions that bind us together. There are some things in life we should all be able to rely on. We all deserve to know that no matter what \u2013 old or young, city or bush, rich or poor \u2013 we\u2019ll be able to lead good, meaningful lives full of purpose. That Australians everywhere can afford to see a doctor. That the children I met in Fitzroy Crossing get the same chance at a great education as children in Melbourne. That pensioners in West Heidelberg can have dignity and security in retirement, just like others. That my children\u2019s generation can fulfil the dream of home ownership. Each of us is subject to the twists and turns of fate. Our social safety net is there to protect everyone \u2013 and everyone deserves the security of knowing it\u2019s there when they need it. If these fundamentals of Australian life break down, or only exist for the better off, then our social fabric breaks down. The same goes for our national institutions.\u201d We haven\u2019t done this for a little bit, but I just went back through the Hansard to count how many times the word \u2018weak\u2019 has featured in Coalition questions or answers this week. At my count Monday \u2013 9 Tuesday \u2013 12 Wednesday \u2013 17 The navy has flagged all of Australia\u2019s ageing Collins class submarines may need upgrading before the new fleet of French-built vessels are operational. \u201cWe are yet to fully determine how many of the boats we will upgrade,\u201d the navy chief, Mike Noonan, told a Senate estimates in hearing in Canberra on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting that we will upgrade at least five.\u201d The first of the new subs is supposed to be delivered by Naval Group in the early 2030s, with the final sub delivered in the 2050s. Defence had previously planned to retire the six Collins subs around 2026. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, who was previously defence minister, also claimed credit for naming the new submarines the \u201cattack class\u201d. Jenny Macklin will deliver her valedictory speech very shortly, after which, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer will deliver hers. For those asking, all of the crossbench, except Bob Katter, who was not in the chamber, voted with Labor to suspend standing orders. Labor had lost three MPs (I think) to 94a Ayes - 71 Noes - 71 But there is no absolute majority, so the motion fails. And Scott Morrison calls an end to question time. Mark Dreyfus takes his opportunity to speak on the motion and then the time for debate is concluded. A division is called. Suspending standing orders takes an absolute majority (I am pretty sure) which is 76. So Labor is unlikely to win this one. Here is that Helloworld statement to the ASX Christopher Pyne was talking about: Helloworld Travel Limited (ASX: HLO) provides the following information in relation to media reports today: Travel Services in the United States This morning an article appeared in the Age and Sydney Morning Herald suggesting the Australian Ambassador to the United States, the Hon Joe Hockey \u201cpushed for a contract\u201d (print version) or \u201crequested a meeting\u201d (revised online version) with Helloworld subsidiary QBT in relation to the provision of travel services to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) in the United States. QBT was awarded a contract in 2015 to provide travel management services to Commonwealth Government Agencies, including DFAT. In 2017, QBT requested a meeting with DFAT personnel in the United States to discuss the provision of travel management services in the US and this meeting took place. QBT understands DFAT personnel met a number of travel services providers as part of its considerations in relation to the provision of travel services in the United States. In August 2018, DFAT started a formal tender process, which QBT has responded to. No announcement has been made in relation to this tender. At no time has Ambassador Hockey or Helloworld CEO Andrew Burnes discussed the DFAT tender and neither Mr Hockey nor Mr Burnes have had any involvement in the tender process. Mr Burnes did not request the meeting with DFAT personnel in the United States. At all times Helloworld and Mr Burnes have acted properly in the tender process. Christopher Pyne: Now, let\u2019s just turn to this issue itself \u2013 this pathetic case that was put by the member for Rankin \u2013 the facts are, Mr Speaker, the ambassador in Washington declared his shareholding in Helloworld before the tender process for the Australian embassy in Washington travel services began.* The tender process commenced with a register for expressions of interest advertised in August 2018. Mr Hockey has had no role in the tender process. He declared his business interests in accordance with the DFAT guidelines. The Australian embassy staff meeting with QBT on 26 April 2017 was not in relation to the tender process. QBT was then and continues to be a travel provider for DFAT through whole-of-government supplier arrangements. Mr Hockey declared his business interests in Helloworld to embassy staff ahead of that meeting. He did not instruct staff to meet QBT or any other companies in relation to the tender. As part of the normal business, Australian embassy staff have met and corresponded with a range of travel providers to discuss the embassy\u2019s travel requirements. They are the facts, Mr Speaker. And Helloworld has put out a statement today to the Australian Stock Exchange, not to the Guardian, not to the ABC, not to the Fairfax press, not to the Labor party machine men who are trying to distract the Australian public from their complete failure on border protection and taxes, no, to the Australian Stock Exchange. So it\u2019s a very high standard required if you declare something to the Australian Stock Exchange. But I tell you what they declared \u2013 they said at no time has embassy Hockey or Helloworld CEO Andrew Burnes discussed the DFAT tender and neither Mr Hockey nor Mr Burns have had any involvement in the tender process.\u201d *Just a thought \u2013 how did that conversation come up? Good morning, oh, and by the way, I need to declare this completely unrelated thing? Mark Dreyfus seconds the motion and reserves his right to speak. Christopher Pyne takes up the government case. Of course the government will not be agreeing to the suspension of standing orders. Mr Speaker, that was really one of the weakest performances I have seen in this place for a very long time. This is the man who is apparently the great white hope of the Queensland right-wing, Mr Speaker. His performance was enough to make himself cry, Mr Speaker. As we know, it\u2019s been the case before in the past when he hasn\u2019t been able to get his own way, Mr Speaker, as was exposed by the previous prime minister, Mr Rudd. This is one of the most \u2013 the weakest cases I have ever seen in this House, Mr Speaker, to condemn either a minister or in this case the ambassador to Washington DC. It is a straight out smear and a straight out slur, Mr Speaker, and what the Labor party have been saying in the press gallery all day today to anybody who wanted to hear, bragging about how they have had this story for months, they have known about the Helloworld story for a long time and they were just waiting to drop it to distract from their own problems, Mr Speaker. To distract from their woes which they have created themselves in the last few weeks. They thought they were coming back to Canberra. ... But they completely mistake the fact that the Canberra bubble is not the Australian public. That is not what the people of Australia are talking about, Mr Speaker.\u201d Lyndal Curtis is having some fun: Jim Chalmers is now attempting to suspend standing orders on the same issue. ... It\u2019s a very, very Liberal scandal. And what we\u2019ve seen today \u2013 what we\u2019ve seen today in this House is the alternative universe that those opposite inhabit. The alternative universe where it\u2019s entirely normal, when you want to book the 3.30 flight out of Perth you ring up the CEO of an ASX-listed company. That\u2019s the alternative universe they live in. The alternative universe when you don\u2019t actually notice when somebody picks up a $3,000 tab for you. You haven\u2019t noticed it comes out of your credit card. The alternative universe those opposite occupy where there is one set of rules for their rich Liberal party mates and another set of rules for ordinary Australians and communities that we represent right around this country. Now there are so many things today, Mr Speaker, that the prime minister and his sidekick, his offsider, the member for Sturt, were unable to explain. So many things they were unable to explain. They couldn\u2019t provide a simple answer to a simple question about whether the documents which prove that Mr Hockey asked one of the embassy officials to take a meeting with a company \u2013 the company at the centre of this scandal \u2013 whether or not that document exists, and when the member for Sturt was asked about this, he basically told the House, \u2018Look, when we get around to checking it out, we\u2019ll see how we go.\u2019 Well, that\u2019s not good enough. That\u2019s not good enough \u2013 the Australian people deserve answers about this latest grubby scandal which is engulfing the government which sits opposite \u2013 opposite from us today. ... There are so many aspects to this, but perhaps the one that the prime minister needs to explain from his own answers today, I think \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of explaining to do from the prime minister, there\u2019s a lot of explaining that he needs to do. But he said today, and he scurried out of the House, he has gone and hid in his office, but he said today, \u2018I\u2019m advised Mr Hockey did not instruct staff to meet QBT or any other companies in relation to the tender and as part of normal business\u2019, and what the prime minister needs to explain, when he speaks, when he next speaks, or when the member for Sturt does, is that he is claiming that Mr Hockey didn\u2019t request embassy staff to meet with QBT at all. Now, this is a very serious issue here, this is a very serious issue. The prime minister is denying something ... of which there are reports of documents which exist from officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. That is a very, very serious matter, Mr Speaker, and that\u2019s why we need to suspend standing orders to get to the bottom of these very, very important issues.\u201d Jim Chalmers is attempting to move this motion: I seek leave to move the following motion \u2013 that the House, one, notes that yesterday it was revealed the finance minister received free flights to Singapore from Helloworld, which he booked by calling the CEO of this ASX-listed company directly, just before it was awarded a multimillion-dollar whole-of-government contract by the minister\u2019s own department, (b) today, it has been reported that US ambassador Joe Hockey, who has a million-dollar shareholding in Helloworld, helped a Helloworld subsidiary lobby for the embassy\u2019s travel contract, (c) the CEO of Helloworld and one of its largest shareholders, Andrew Burnes, is a Liberal party heavyweight and currently Liberal party treasurer with connections to a number of Liberal party politicians, (d) the finance minister told Senate estimates yesterday that he had \u201ca close personal relationship\u201d with Mr Burnes, (e) Mr Burnes was previously a colleague of the now-prime minister during the prime minister\u2019s time at Tourism Australia, (f) since being awarded government contracts, the share price of Helloworld has skyrocketed, making shareholders like Mr Hockey and Mr Burns rich, and (g) it was reported that the Herald Sun asked almost all of the 82 Liberal MPs in parliament whether they had received free travel from Helloworld, but only 14 said that they had not, and, (2) therefore calls on the prime minister to investigate and report to the House how far this Helloworld scandal reaches into his government. He is denied on the voices. Jim Chalmers with the Nick Champion question (just cut down) to Scott Morrison: Is the prime minister confident that trips like the one by the minister for home affairs and Joe Hockey with Helloworld\u2019s CEO and Liberal treasurer Mr Andrew Burnes to Las Vegas, were paid at the full commercial rate? Morrison: Again, Mr Speaker, the member comes here and just makes assertions ... He makes ... and then he asks me to respond as if those assertions are true, Mr Speaker. No, he is not asking \u2013 it is said to me, how dare he answer the question, he is not asking a question, he is making an assertion about something he hasn\u2019t even established as a fact and on that basis, Mr Speaker, I don\u2019t agree necessarily with the presumption of the question and therefore, on what basis should I allow a member to come and simply just come to the despatch box, cast aspersions on people in this chamber and the other chamber and former members of the chamber simply because the Labor party wants to distract attention from the fact they\u2019ve come into this place and undermined Australia\u2019s border protection regime, Mr Speaker? We know, because they\u2019ve been boasting around the media for some time, that they have had this little issue for some time in the drawer and when the pressure is on, they pull it out. He finishes before Tony Burke can ask him about relevance. Josh Frydenberg is now referencing sledgehammers and now I have Peter Gabriel stuck in my head and there is NO excuse for that. Josh Frydenberg is now talking about a couple who \u201cplucked up the courage\u201d to buy a two-bedroom apartment. Not all heroes wear capes, people. Christian Porter takes a dixer where he makes reference to a \u201cring of steel\u201d and I just can not. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: Nine reports, and I quote, \u2018In Mr Hockey\u2019s case, DFAT documents seen by the Age and Sydney Morning Herald show that he asked embassy staff to set up a meeting between minister councillor Justin Phillips who oversees the embassy\u2019s operations and an executive from Helloworld Sydney Qantas Business travel.\u201d Does the prime minister deny such documents exist? Christopher Pyne takes this one, but with permission first this time. The prime minister was asked about conflict of interest in that question and let me say this about conflict of interest \u2013 the Labor party, since we got into power in 2013, have opposed every single attempt we have made to make the unions accountable in this country, Mr Speaker.\u201d He\u2019s told that is not the question. So he starts again. Well, thank you, Mr Speaker, and if such documents exist, and if such reports exist, I\u2019m sure that we can find those things out when we actually investigate the efficacy of this question, Mr Speaker, and I\u2019m not going to simply accept on face value that because the opposition says something, it makes it true, Mr Speaker. We see time and time again that in fact that is not the case \u2013 that the Labor party take long bows, exaggerations, use all sorts of means to try and twist the truth, and I\u2019ve seen that for a quarter of a century in this place. So I\u2019m hardly going to simply accept what the member for Rankin says, and respond to it as though it\u2019s factual. But I was asked \u2013 I thought generally the question was an implication of conflict of interest, Mr Speaker. Conflict of interest of our ambassador in Washington, DC and, as I said before in my answer, the government has absolute confidence in our ambassador in Washington, DC, and we\u2019re not going to take lectures from the Labor party about integrity in politics.\u201d He goes on to repeat his answer from the last question, but is sat down for straying off topic by Smith. Channel 7 host Larry Emdur\u2019s recent half-hour flight in a fighter jet was worth about $8,000. Emdur underwent flight training and dressed up in a fighter pilot\u2019s uniform for a segment on the Morning Show and was accompanied by the defence minister, Christopher Pyne, at an Australian air force base. \u201cIt\u2019s the most amazing thing I\u2019ve done in my life,\u201d Emdur said. A fighter pilot tells Emdur in the footage if he throws up in the jet he has to clean it up. Pyne told Emdur his name in Top Gun would be Viper. The Labor senator Kimberley Kitching quizzed defence officials about the filming opportunity during a Senate estimates hearing on Wednesday. The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said media access to defence bases was a timely way to show the Australian people defence capability and hopefully interest youngsters in joining the military. Asked about the costs, the air force chief, Leo Davies, said there was a standard rate per hour for aircraft \u2013 $16,000 an hour for the F18 Hornet. \u201cIt was part of the already budgeted F18 flying hours, it was not an additional cost,\u201d Davies said. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: It\u2019s reported that an Australian foreign affairs official expressed concerns about a potential conflict of interest after Joe Hockey directed embassy staff to meet with a subsidiary of Helloworld, a company in which Mr Hockey has a million-dollar shareholding. When did this official first express concerns about Mr Hockey\u2019s conflict of interest and will the prime minister undertake to table, within 24 hours, all relevant documents about this matter in this House? Christopher Pyne decides to take this. Without the nod from the prime minister. I represent the minister for foreign affairs in the House of Representatives, so I\u2019ll answer this question. Tony Smith: No, just before \u2013 no, I\u2019m not satisfied with that. I mean, I need to... Scott Morrison gives the nod. Pyne: Happy to take the question, prime minister. We always check. We always check every single claim the Labor party make about any sort of report, especially in the media, before we decide whether it\u2019s fact or not, that has been our tradition in this place. I can tell you, Mr Speaker, as the minister who represents the minister for foreign affairs, we have every confidence in Joe Hockey as our ambassador in Washington, DC. He is a former distinguished member of this House. He is a former distinguished treasurer. He is a great \u2013 he did a great deal more to get this economy back on track than any member the Labor party ever had and one of the reasons we are reaping the benefits today of budget surpluses and a strong economy is because of the work that Joe Hockey did when he was a distinguished member of this House, Mr Speaker. (That was not the question) So first point I would make ... is that we have every confidence in the integrity of Joe Hockey, our ambassador in Washington. The second point I would make is we have absolutely no confidence in the integrity of many members of the Labor party over the many years that I have been in this place and to be lectured \u2013 to be lectured by the Labor party about fiscal rectitude, the party of Eddie Obeid, the party of Joe Triponi, the party of Rex Jackson, if you want to go back a few decades, Mr Speaker... The party who required a royal commission, a royal commission, to get out of the leader of the opposition a donation that he had forgotten all about, Mr Speaker. It took eight years, the party of John Setker, Mr Speaker, who they revere and put into a position of importance in the Labor party. The party of Ian Macdonald. There were almost as many people in prison... So we will not be lectured by the Labor party about integrity or fiscal rectitude in this place and we all know what\u2019s going on here. The prime minister nailed it earlier. The Labor party have had a shocker of a couple of weeks, Mr Speaker. They thought the big story out of this fortnight would be the Canberra bubble, would be about votes in the House of Representatives, who was up and who was down. But it isn\u2019t, Mr Speaker. The story out of this fortnight is that Labor is weak on border protection and cannot be trusted...\u201d Nick Champion to Scott Morrison: Yesterday, it was revealed the finance minister received free flights to Singapore from Helloworld just before it was awarded a multimillion-dollar whole-of-government contract by the minister\u2019s own department and today it was reported that US ambassador Joe Hockey, who has a million-dollar shareholding in Helloworld, helped a Helloworld subsidiary lobby for embassy travel contracts. Is the prime minister confident that trips like the one by the Minister for Home Affairs and Joe Hockey ... He doesn\u2019t finish. Tony Smith says there is no question there. Wayne Swan says he couldn\u2019t hear the question and there was \u201cclearly\u201d an issue. Smith lets him ask the question again. Champion RUSHES it out. But he doesn\u2019t get the question out in time. \u201cNo issue with the microphone there, and again there was no question,\u201d Smith rules. We move on to Ian Goodenough\u2019s dixer. Josh Frydenberg congratulates him on \u201cbeing able to ask a question properly\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s how you do it!\u201d a government MP yells out. So loudly I can hear it through the broadcast. I\u2019m not sure that is the compliment they think it is, though. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister confirm reports that US ambassador Joe Hockey was contacted by Helloworld\u2019s CEO and Liberal party treasurer Andrew Burnes. Mr Hockey then directed embassy staff to meet with the Helloworld to discuss travel arrangements and the embassy staff were not aware of Joe Hockey\u2019s interest in Helloworld until after that meeting had taken place. Is the prime minister seriously telling the Australian people that this behaviour is completely acceptable? Morrison: Again, the member is misrepresenting the truth. He does this constantly. His mentor up there [Wayne Swan] misrepresented the truth when he said he was going to deliver four surpluses, Mr Speaker, and they turned out to be deficits. The prince of deficits is leaving the chamber, Mr Speaker, sadly. He is leaving the chamber, but I wish him all the best in his retirement. Mr Speaker, I can advise the Australian embassy staff meeting ... on 26 April 2017, I\u2019m advised, was not in relation to the tender process. QBT was then, and continues to be, a travel agency for DFAT through a whole-of-government supply arrangement. Mr Joe Hockey declared his interest in Helloworld to embassy staff ahead of the meeting. I\u2019m advised embassy staff did not meet QBT or other staff in relation to the tender and embassy staff have met and corresponded with a whole range of travel providers to discuss the embassy\u2019s travel requirements. So, Mr Speaker, what this is, just again, is the Labor party trying to distract attention with all these slurs, all these smears, all these grubby claims, Mr Speaker, because ... they know they have been caught out doing the wrong thing by the Australian people and well outside this bubble here, Mr Speaker, whether it is out in Penrith or up in Townsville or over in Bunbury, they know one thing and that is the Labor party cannot be trusted on border protection because the leader of the Labor party is a weak soul when it comes to this issue, Mr Speaker. He cannot be trusted and his party is riven and divided on the issue of border protection. Only today \u2013 only today, we had the deputy leader of the opposition agreeing with the member for Wentworth, who had said \u2013 now, I wouldn\u2019t suggest the member for Wentworth take geography lessons from the member for Sydney, Mr Speaker, that said these people should not come to ... Christmas Island, they should come to Australia, Mr Speaker. They should come to \u2013 they shouldn\u2019t come to Christmas Island, they should come to Australia. Now, I can see the member for Sydney agrees with that, Mr Speaker ... but honestly they should be taken to a place, Mr Speaker, where we can be sure that any persons who come to this place who shouldn\u2019t be are held in detention. He finishes, but Tony Smith issues a warning for answers to stay on subject matter. Senator Derryn Hinch has offered this critique of Michaelia Cash\u2019s evidence: \u201cIt sounds like a round robin. You tell Senate estimates it\u2019s before the courts, you told the police you told Senate estimates. It sounds like a round-robin.\u201d Cash responded: \u201cNo, I actually answered copious questions [in Senate estimates]\u201d. She said after she provided the AFP with a transcript of her evidence in Senate estimates, they \u201cdidn\u2019t have further questions\u201d even though they \u201chad every opportunity\u201d to ask follow-ups. Hinch then asks if in a meeting with Malcolm Turnbull and two staffers (including former chief of staff Ben Davies) whether either of them piped up when she denied knowledge of the leaks. Cash takes the question on notice, to check the estimates transcript about what she\u2019s already said on the topic. Josh Frydenberg talks about all the poor, poor retirees on Australia\u2019s \u201clowest (*coughs TAXABLE*) incomes\u201d. We move on. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: Today, it has been reported that US ambassador Joe Hockey, who has a million-dollar shareholding in Helloworld, helped them lobby for the travel contract. How can it possibly be appropriate for Joe Hockey to use his official position as his ambassador to help Helloworld win a government contract? Why does this Liberal government only ever look after itself and its mates at the top end of town? Morrison: I can advise that \u2013 I\u2019m advised that Mr Joe Hockey declared his shareholding in Helloworld before the tender process ... ... The tender process commenced with the register for expressions of interest advertised in August 2018. Mr Hockey has had no role in the tender process. He has declared his business interests in accordance with DFAT guidelines. So, Mr Speaker, this is just another grubby attempt by the Labor party to distract attention from one very simple thing ... they know they have made a very big mistake in showing up the weakness of their own leader by forcing him to back down ... By forcing the Labor leader to back down to them and come into this place and weaken Australia\u2019s border security arrangements and they can come in here and throw all the mud they like but one thing will be known well outside the Canberra bubble, that is when it comes to border protection, you can\u2019t trust Labor, Mr Speaker. You cannot trust Labor and I\u2019ll tell you why \u2013 it\u2019s because they are so divided on the issue of border protection. This is why they failed so badly in government. They could not agree on this issue from one day to the next, and that\u2019s why you can\u2019t trust Labor.\u201d Adam Bandt has the crossbench question. And he uses it to troll Michael McCormack: Climate change poses massive risks to Australia\u2019s infrastructure including from rising sea levels, floods that are more intense and bushfires like we\u2019ve already seen this year. Deputy prime minister, will you join me in congratulating the courageous school students going on strike on 15 March, right around the country, calling for urgent climate action and the protection of Australia\u2019s infrastructure? Will you commend these young people and the 15,000 who went on strike last November, for taking time off school to show us what real leadership looks like?\u201d McCormack (it ... goes places. And we learn just how bad McCormacking can be, when he doesn\u2019t have a script.) Well, I tell you what, real leadership doesn\u2019t look like anything that the member for Melbourne brings to this chamber, Mr Speaker. The children should be at school, that\u2019s where they should be. They should be learning about Australian history, they should be learning about Australian geography, they should be learning about all the lessons that their teachers are willing to teach them. Mr Speaker, they should be at school, and I\u2019m pleased ... that I\u2019m part of a government that\u2019s spending record funding on schools, Mr Speaker. Record funding on public schools, record funding on schools in general, Mr Speaker, and the member for Melbourne would do far better off, Mr Speaker, advising those children to go to school and to stay at school. What would happen \u2013 who\u2019s going to look after those kids when they\u2019re out protesting? I know the Greens like to protest, because that\u2019s all you ever bring to the national debate is protests and frivolous rallies. You\u2019d do far better off joining the Liberal and the National parties in talking about the economic narrative, in talking about how important it is to have a job in this country, because if you want to work in this country, well, there\u2019s a job there for you. You\u2019d be far better off talking about our record investment in defence and not siding with those on that side who, when they had six years of opportunity, dropped our defence investment spending levels to 1.6% of GDP, down to the same levels of appeasement and I don\u2019t know why the member for Greenway is complaining or laughing \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s no laughing matter. It\u2019s important that we spend money on defence. It\u2019s important that our defence people have the very best of equipment.\u201d Here, even Tony Smith has reached his limit. I\u2019m going to say the deputy prime minister was asked a question with a number of elements, but straying into defence is not relevant to the question. The deputy prime minister can resume his answer but he needs to be relevant to the question.\u201d McCormack, carries on. \u201cThe best place for those children is at school learning about Australian history, learning about all the important things that their teachers, our very best teachers, mind you ...\u201d Bandt interjects on relevance to ask if McCormack could explain what the students could do with the science they learn in school. McCormack: [The member has been here] long enough to know he can\u2019t introduce new material into a question, so you can\u2019t have two goes, you can\u2019t have two goes, but I\u2019m proud to be part of a government that invests in teachers \u2013 quality teachers. My daughter is a quality teacher and I tell you what, Mr Speaker, so too are our teachers and you know what, they should be in class, they should be teaching our children, the very best children, and I tell you what, yeah, they\u2019re up there, too, well done for pointing them out, good on you. Well, I tell you what, I hope they don\u2019t learn too many sentences from you, the member for McMahon, because you haven\u2019t brought much to the national debate lately, and when they get old I hope you\u2019ve got nothing to do with their franking credits and negative gearing. The children should be at school learning all the important things their teachers are going to teach them.\u201d Fin. Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: Yesterday, the prime minister was asked whether all his ministers had fully complied with the ministerial standards in all of their dealings with Mr Andrew Burnes and Helloworld. The prime minister answered, \u201cI\u2019m advised there\u2019s nothing before me that could conflict with the question that the member just put to me.\u201d Prime Minister, is that still the case? Morrison (who apparently sees his I WILL NOT BE LECTURED moment) It is still the case, Mr Speaker, and I\u2019m not going to take lectures from the leader of the Labor party who took eight years to disclose the campaign support he got from unions when he first ran for the parliament, Mr Speaker. I\u2019m not going to take lectures from those on my right, Mr Speaker, who won\u2019t even cooperate with the police when it comes to taking money out of union members\u2019 pockets and giving it to GetUp himself. I\u2019m not going to be lectured by this bloke, Mr Speaker.\u201d *Extreme Regina George voice* Stop trying to make Michael McCormack happen. It\u2019s not going to happen. Michealia Cash has come up as a question time topic. Brendan O\u2019Connor to Scott Morrison: Yesterday in question time, the prime minister said that both minister Cash and the Human Services minister cooperated with the Australian Federal Police investigation about a leaked police raid but the police told Estimates they asked ministers for witness statements on at least two separate occasions, but none were provided. Who\u2019s telling the truth - the prime minister or the police? Because both can\u2019t be correct. Morrison: Mr Speaker, there\u2019s another option, and that is the member who asked the question is not representing the truth of these proceedings, Mr Speaker, which is no surprise. No surprise whatsoever. Because, as I said yesterday, at no stage after the statements that were requested by the AFP was - and that was provided - I advised that further information and advice that the statement was provided was insufficient, Mr Speaker, and what I can tell you is that the AFP has acknowledged the receipt of both the correspondence from Minister Keenan and from Minister Cash and in relation to Minister Keenan he said, \u201cI acknowledge receipt of your statement, AFP will review the statement and if we require any further clarification we may reach out to you.\u201d That was the end of the matter, Mr Speaker. ... My ministers cooperated with the requirements of the AFP, and the ... ... Mr Speaker, the simple explanation is this. The AFP contacted the ministers, the ministers responded, and no further information was sought from the ministers.\u201d Labor senator Doug Cameron is still grilling small business minister Michaelia Cash, peppering his speech with the allegation the media tipoff about the raids constituted \u201ccriminal leaking\u201d. Cash said he is being \u201crather loose\u201d in his language and notes that there \u201care no proceedings\u201d afoot. Cameron clarifies he is talking about criminal \u201cactivity\u201d, even if it hasn\u2019t resulted in charges and proceedings. Cash said she had no discussions with then justice minister Michael Keenan about the raids, and rejects the suggestion that there was \u201ca conspiracy between ministers\u201d. Asked about whether she was aware that her chief of staff Ben Davieswas involved (the federal court heard he told her former senior media adviser about the warrants), Cash replied: \u201cThe evidence I gave on Friday was clear: I had no prior knowledge of the raids, of the execution of warrants. Other than what I\u2019ve seen in media reports, I have no way to verify if that\u2019s true, that would be the first time [I learned about that], reading the media reports.\u201d All this dixer has taught me is that Scott Morrison is once again yelling in question time. Cathy O\u2019Toole to Scott Morrison: Townsville has experienced our worst natural disaster in our recorded history. The devastating flood has affected more than 22,000 homes. Why won\u2019t the prime minister schedule extra sitting days so this parliament can pass laws to make insurance companies treat north Queenslanders fairly? When will the prime minister stop listening to the insurers and start listening to the people of north Queensland? Morrison says the government has worked quickly to provide an immediate response, including financial support. But he will not be scheduling extra sitting days. After a point of order on relevance from Tony Burke, he addresses the insurance part of the question (and links it to border protection): \u201c... Specifically on the matter of insurance that is one of the many issues that the government is dealing with as part of the ministerial task force in our response to the flood crisis in northern Queensland and the assistant treasurer has been working on those issues and I can assure you that the insurance companies are on notice from our government that they need to address the claims and they need to be standing with the people of north Queensland in the same way that our government is doing just that, Mr Speaker. I\u2019m very disappointed that the government has been put in the situation where we have to spend $500m in the next two years opening a detention centre which we didn\u2019t need to do two weeks ago, Mr Speaker, and the only reason we have to do that is because the leader of the Labor party has no interest in border protection. Michaelia Cash has just asked for a \u201ccertified\u201d copy of the federal court proceedings, where David de Garis has given testimony. She says she has not seen a copy, and can not answer questions about what he may have said. For a refresher on what was said, head here Michaelia Cash said that Labor\u2019s Doug Cameron has consistently accused her of having prior knowledge of the raids on the Australian Workers Union headquarters, but states she had \u201cno prior knowledge of the execution of the warrants\u201d - and she gave evidence under oath on Friday in the federal court. She\u2019s back on the attack: \u201cMr Bill Shorten could go under oath and say whether he had appropriate authorisations for the [AWU\u2019s] $100k [donation to GetUp] and $25k to his own election campaign. One has to wonder what is in the documents the [Australian Federal Police] have seized from the AWU that they are fighting tooth and nail to ensure the [registered organisations] commission and Australian public never ever see? I wonder if the documents show Mr Shorten did not have the authorisations?\u201d Cash also rejected the suggestion she had been \u201cdemoted\u201d by noting that she is still a cabinet minister, a \u201cprivilege\u201d that Cameron has never and will never have (as he\u2019s leaving parliament at next election). Michaelia Cash has STILL not seen a transcript of the AFP evidence and says she will not comment on what was said, until she has seen it. We are also in the downhill slide to question time. Michaelia Cash is now taking umbrage at Doug Cameron saying last night that she was demoted. She says that she is a cabinet minister, which is a privilege that Cameron will never have. And she is \u201cdelighted\u201d to be the minister for small and family business. Labor foreign affairs spokeswoman Penny Wong has held a press conference to attack the Coalition\u2019s handling of the $50bn future submarine program. She said: \u201cBefore the last election [defence minister] Christopher Pyne told South Australians that the local build, the local content, the Australian content would be 90%.... then that became 60%. \u201cGuess what we learned today in Senate estimates: there is no minimum Australian content for our submarines program. No minimum amount of Australian jobs ... utterly contrary to the promises made by Christopher Pyne and others before the election.\u201d Michaelia Cash has come in with a statement that points to it all being Bill Shorten\u2019s fault. She also points out that Joe Ludwig cost the Commonwealth almost $800,000 in legal fees. Except \u2013 that was when the cattle industry sued him. Which is a little different to what we are looking at today. Michaelia Cash has turned up in the education and employment estimates. Doug Cameron is thrilled. What about the chaplains program? Tanya Plibersek says Labor will go back to a \u2018school\u2019s choice\u2019 position. This is one of those policy areas that\u2019s gone back and forward with every change of government and we will go back to the position we had when we were last in government, the funding remains. Schools can choose to employ chaplains if they wish. Or they can choose to employ a secular youth worker, social worker, someone with adequate qualifications to give support, mentoring, deliver social welfare in the students. When it comes to the teachers, I wouldn\u2019t want the school chaplaincy program paying for that. But one of the benefits of the $14bn in additional funding that we will give to public schools and the restoration of funding to Catholic and independent schools is you can hire more specialist teachers to reduce some of the workload on teachers and continuing professional development, feeling like you are on top of what you are doing incredibly reduces your stress load. Most of the extra funding that needs-based funding brought to our schools last time was doing that, it was bringing in specialist teaching, extra teacher aids, it was giving teachers more one-on-one time with students. It was giving more opportunity for professional development so that people felt confident in the classroom. I will give you an example. If you are a teacher who has never taught someone with a particular disability and an eight-year-old comes in that year and you really want to do the best for this child, having the opportunity to be, to get some training, to get some mentoring, to work with other teachers to work out how to best teach that child \u2013 that changes \u2013 it makes the teaching a joy rather than something that\u2019s keeping you awake at night. That is the sort of opportunity we want to give our teachers.\u201d Asked again about Adani, Tanya Plibersek gives the response we were talking about a little earlier: Well, we\u2019ve been very clear about our position. We say first of all that there is no way we would give $1bn of taxpayers\u2019 money to an Indian mining conglomerate to build this mine. Then we said the project would have to stack up on environmental and economic grounds. That is the way we make decisions about all projects. We don\u2019t make a case-by-case decision about how we feel about a particular project. We have rules, we have laws, we work through them and we make a sensible decision. The evidence that we\u2019ve seen so far is that the jobs claims of Adani are vastly overstated. We get that Central and North Queensland need jobs and that is why we\u2019ve committed hundreds of millions of dollars to investing in real infrastructure projects, port upgrades, airport upgrades, road upgrades, that really unlock the agriculture and tourism potential of those regions. As well as the jobs you get in construction in running the new facilities, you get greater access to the world for the products of central Central and north Queensland and greater access of the world to those regions for tourism. That is really important because that is real jobs, it is not the fake job promises that Adani keeps making and then letting us down on. Also, when it comes to environmental assessments, there are a number of outstanding environmental questions as you know about this particular project. I believe the royalties agreement hasn\u2019t been signed yet with the Queensland government. We\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see what happens. Tanya Plibersek has also been asked about Richard Marles\u2019s comments on thermal coal: The first thing to say about coal is it\u2019s not about how we feel about coal, it\u2019s not the vibe. There is a simple economic fact that the world is moving away from coal-fired power generation, it\u2019s becoming increasingly expensive, we\u2019ve recognised that global warming is a problem, we want to reduce our pollution, some countries are worried about the air quality in their cities. However you look at it, this is a change that is happening not just in our economy, but around the world. And how I feel about it is not the relevant issue. It is back to the data. The data shows us that renewables are becoming cheaper all the time. And to fantasise about building new coal-fired power stations with taxpayers\u2019 money as some of the Liberals and Nationals are doing, is irresponsible.\u201d And a little bit later, when asked about whether there is a divide within Labor on coal, she says this: I keep reading all these articles about differences of opinion and that\u2019s just not the case. We see the jobs in the coal industry at the moment as very important jobs and that\u2019s why we want to plan long term with affected communities for their future. What we have seen under this government is coal-fired power stations close with little or no warning, throwing people out of work, with no adjustment, no help to their communities. But the simple economics of power generation mean that renewables are getting cheaper all the time. We need to be alive to that.\u201d Tanya Plibersek has just been asked that very question at the press club: Your second question pretends there is some difference between Bill and I on the issue of asylum seekers - it is not true. The proposition is absolutely false. But what I\u2019ll say - I\u2019ll say this: It is up to the government to explain how people who cannot be adequately treated on Manus Island and Nauru can have adequate medical treatment on Christmas Island. It is up to them to explain how that can happen. It is up to them to explain how they justify the extra expense of doing it this way given that this government has already brought hundreds of people from Manus Island and Nauru to Australia to the mainland for medical treatment. The last briefing we got, I think the security agency said the number of people who had been brought here for medical treatment by this government in recent times was close to 400. And the number of accompanying family members was something over 500. How can it be safe for those people to be brought here by Peter Dutton but we need to open Christmas Island for anybody else? I\u2019d like the government to explain that.\u201d The Greens leader Richard Di Natale has a few things to say about Labor and the Christmas Island proposal: Just when you begin to hope that the Labor Party was starting to find a backbone on refugees, Bill Shorten has gone to water,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cDespite his deputy saying the government\u2019s policy to transfer sick patients to Christmas island for treatment was \u2018difficult to understand\u2019 and his immigration spokesperson saying the reopening the centre was \u2018silly\u2019, Bill Shorten thinks it\u2019s \u2018fine\u2019. \u201cBuying into Scott Morrison\u2019s propaganda that there is any need to reopen Christmas Island, or that it has the required medical facilities, is a failure of leadership. \u201cAll it took was a litle criticism from Peter Dutton and one bad poll result for Bill Shorten to get spooked and start aligning himself with the Liberal government on the issue again. \u201cA government that is determined to shun the will of the parliament and refuse to bring sick people here for treatment, deserves a strong opposition \u2013 not a benign collaborator.\u201d Departmental officials have defended monitoring social media for complaints about the contentious ParentsNext welfare program, saying they need to correct misinformation. But they also revealed they have contacted participants\u2019 ParentsNext providers without telling them in order to examine complaints welfare recipients have posted on social media. Bureaucrats from the Department of Jobs and Small Business were asked at Senate Estimates on Wednesday about the case of single mother and welfare campaigner Ella Buckland, who told Guardian Australia a freedom of information request had shown officials were collecting \u201cbackground\u201d information about her. \u201cOur media coverage doesn\u2019t go to individuals \u2026 it goes to programs that we are running,\u201d deputy secretary Nathan Smyth told the hearing. \u201cWe need to at times correct misinformation and at times brief ministers\u2019 offices about misinformation that might be out there around the program.\u201d Department official Greg Manning said staff would only monitor material on social media that used a welfare program\u2019s name or tagged the department. Officials said they were \u201cnot trawling through posts on Twitter\u201d, but Manning said there were a small number of cases where they had contacted the providers of parents who had been critical of the program. \u201cI think Ms Buckland\u2019s been critical of an activity \u2026 we would go to the provider and go, is this right?\u201d Manning said. Normally, they would not tell the participant before contacting their provider, the hearing was told. Siewert said that participants viewed that as an \u201cinvasion of privacy\u201d, particularly when the first time they were told about their personal social media posts was by their provider. \u201cPeople see it as the department being Big Brother,\u201d she said. Penny Wong and the South Australian Labor leader Peter Malinauskas (which is absolutely a Lithuanian name, if I am not mistaken. To which I say, labas) will be holding a press conference at 1.15pm. Tanya Plibersek is part way through delivering her speech: If I become education minister I want an education for every Australian child that is as good as the education I want for my own children. That means every school must be a great school. That means parents shouldn\u2019t have to drive across town or work a second job to pay school fees or buy coaching because they\u2019re worried about the standard of education at the school down the road. Not every school can have 10 rugby fields or a rifle range but every parent should be confident that the local public school will educate their child as well as the nation\u2019s most elite private school. That there will books and computers and sporting equipment and buildings that show the value we place as a community on education. And most importantly, world-class teaching. If parents want a religious education or private schooling for their child, then Labor absolutely supports that choice. We respect every parent\u2019s right to choose the school and system that best suits their child. The reality is that many families have children in more than one system. They choose the school that best meets the needs of each individual child. But the truth is there\u2019s no genuine choice if your local public school is struggling. He mentioned it in his doorstop \u2013 but here is the official line from David Littleproud on those Woolworths shares: I\u2019ve instructed my broker to sell my 25 shares in Woolworths worth $756.25, which returned $15 last year. Any proceeds will be donated to the Western Queensland Drought Appeal. The reason I\u2019ve chosen to sell this tiny number of shares was Labor was using it as a distraction from the real issue \u2013 dairy farmers aren\u2019t getting paid a fair price for their milk. The shares and their $15 return created absolutely no conflict of interest and I will continue to bash Coles and Aldi for their poor treatment of farmers, as well as Woolworths when they deserve it. I\u2019ll also criticise other companies I have shares in \u2013 Commonwealth Bank, ANZ and Telstra for instance \u2013 when they step out of line as I have for the two and a half years I\u2019ve been in politics. Had I kept the 25 shares and their $15 return, some media would continue to give coverage to Labor highlighting me owning 25 Woolworths shares which returned $15 last year instead of the fact dairy farmers are not being paid fairly, and dairy farmers can\u2019t afford that.\u201d Tanya Plibersek is about to address the National Press Club. She\u2019ll be talking about Labor\u2019s education policy. Departmental officials are being grilled about the government\u2019s new welfare compliance regime, which came into effect in August. We covered that issue in some detail this morning with a story that revealed the new system had led to a 40% increase in payment suspensions. But as government senator Linda Reynolds tells the hearing, the number of financial \u201cpenalties\u201d has decreased dramatically \u2013 by about 95%. The distinction here is about the difference between a penalty (having a payment docked or cut completely), compared with a suspension, where payments are temporarily suspended until a welfare recipients \u201cre-engages\u201d. Greens senator Rachel Siewert says the distinction is a myth: \u201cAs far as the humans on this are concerned, a suspension is a penalty because it means they don\u2019t get access to any money.\u201d The department confirms that of all people who\u2019ve received a financial penalty under the Jobactive program, one quarter were Indigenous. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a concern,\u201d the department\u2019s Nathan Smyth concedes. It also hears that 52% of people considered homeless have received some sort of \u201cdemerit point\u201d \u2013 and therefore a payment \u201csuspension\u201d. More on that here. Reynolds says from the government\u2019s perspective \u201cthe numbers show that the (compliance regime) is actually working as intended\u201d. She says only 2% of Indigenous people on Jobactive go to the \u201cpenalty zone\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s perfect,\u201d she adds. The nation\u2019s farmer\u2019s lobby is not totally opposed to Labor\u2019s idea of asking the ACCC to look at a floor price for milk. But in a statement, the National Farmers\u2019 Federation \u201cremains highly cautious about simple solutions to the dairy industry\u2019s complex problems\u201d. \u201cOur dairy sector is under significant pressure, there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d NFF president Fiona Simson said. \u201cWe are always willing to listen to new strategies that might ease this pressure and to ensure a fair price for farmers; this includes hearing the ACCC thoughts on the merits of a minimum farm gate milk price.\u201d However, Simson said Labor\u2019s floor price idea appeared to be a nod to the past rather than a serious strategy for the future. \u201cWe need a dairy sector that is strong, sustainable and competitive at home and on the world stage. \u201cAs an export dependent industry, that exports two-thirds of what we produce, prices for Australian agricultural products are largely determined by international market forces. \u201cWe\u2019d be really interested to see if and how a regulated floor price might enhance the dairy sector\u2019s global competitiveness.\u201d Richard Marles is getting a bit of heat over this comment to Sky News this morning: The global market for thermal coal has collapsed, and wonderful \u2013 that\u2019s a good thing \u2013 because what that implies is the world is acting in relation to climate change.\u201d That follows on from the splash in the Australian from Michael McKenna on Bill Ludwig, a former union leader and big deal in old Labor circles, criticising the Queensland deputy premier, Jackie Trad, for not supporting Adani. Adani is still a very, very fraught issue for Queensland Labor \u2013 the government doesn\u2019t want to support it, but it can\u2019t not support it. So it has just gone for a largely hands-off approach. Which means it\u2019s a tricky issue for federal Labor, which has taken much the same path. Labor remains united on no public funds for the mine. As for coal, it is attempting to straddle the middle road. Yes to renewables, but coal will still play its role. Word from Labor is Marles\u2019s comments this morning are being considered \u201ca little clumsy\u201d given the sensitivity around coalmines in Queensland communities, that want them (and Labor wants their seats) but basically on message \u2013 let the market decide. For those asking (and yes, I know there is a lot), Michaelia Cash is due back in estimates this afternoon. You can find the program here David Littleproud has stood up on why the government voted against Labor\u2019s move to ask the ACCC to examine milk prices. He says it would be giving dairy farmers \u201cfalse hope that we can regulate an industry\u201d. I\u2019d rather sit here and look them in the eye and say that won\u2019t happen than to play political stunts with their livelihoods. And speaking of political stunts, can I finish off with the one that Mr Fitzgibbon has played in terms of the shares I have in Woolworths. I think the dividend per year is about $15. I tried to sell these shares some time ago. If that is the level of contribution to the debate, around trying to besmirch my character, I\u2019m fighting for dairy farmers. Is he fit to be here? Let me say, I\u2019ve got shares in Telstra and big banks and let me tell you I\u2019ve had a stink with all of them and I\u2019m not afraid to have a stink with them because I will support the people I\u2019m here to represent.\u201d I have just seen this. But Christopher Pyne says his Top Gun nickname would be Viper. VIPER. Pyne is many things. But he is not Tom Skerritt who flew with Maverick\u2019s heroic son-of- a-bitch father who was lost in a battle on the wrong side of some line on a map. No one is going \u201cHoly shit, it\u2019s Christopher Pyne.\u201d I\u2019m sorry. But Top Gun is very important to me. I do not take it lightly. We\u2019re still on the PaTH internships program at department of jobs estimates. Labor senator Deb O\u2019Neill is asking about a business that hosted 17 interns and offered none of them a job afterwards. Departmental official Greg Manning explains that the business has been excluded from the program. The department has also sent a letter requesting the business pay back the subsidies they received \u2013 $1,000 per intern so $17,000 in total. They asked for a response before December, but haven\u2019t gotten one. After a short discussion, the department agrees to name the company: JWM Communications. O\u2019Neill tells the hearing the business had benefitted from a year of free labour. \u201cHopefully they get the communication and they pay the money back to the government,\u201d O\u2019Neill says. Speaking of US-Australian relations, we finally have a new ambassador John Berry finished his term in September 2016 and the position has been officially empty ever since. Then we were supposed to get Admiral Harry Harris, but he was then diverted to South Korea. So welcome, Arthur B Culvahouse Jr. Conclusion It is in both nations\u2019 interests to have a secure and stable region, and the joint facilities and capabilities all play their role in ensuring regional security and stability is achieved. But the alliance and regional stability cannot be taken for granted. This government remains committed to growing and deepening all aspects of the relationship and working with the US to advance our mutual defence and security interests. Our defence and intelligence cooperation will continue to evolve to meet ever-changing threats and challenges. As it must. The spirit of innovation shared by our nations will continue to support the Australia-US alliance and continue to be our strength, as the alliance evolves now and into the future. As we adapt to meet new challenges to the rules-based global order, our defence and intelligence cooperation and joint facilities will endure as our ever-vigilant eyes and ears in the world. Full knowledge and concurrence \u2013 protecting Australia\u2019s sovereignty While successive Australian governments have recognised the national security benefits that we gain from the joint facilities and by hosting US capabilities, they have also recognised that our national interests and sovereignty have to be honoured and protected. This has been achieved by our policy of full knowledge and concurrence. Full knowledge and concurrence is central to Australia hosting any foreign capability, be they from the US or any other country. It is an expression of Australia\u2019s sovereignty and a fundamental right to know what activities foreign governments conduct on our soil. \u201cFull knowledge\u201d equates to Australia having a full and detailed understanding of any capability or activity with a presence on Australian territory or making use of Australian assets. \u201cConcurrence\u201d means that Australia approves the presence of a capability or function in Australia, in support of mutually agreed goals. That does not mean Australia approves each and every activity or tasking undertaken; rather, it means that Australia agrees to the purpose of activities conducted in Australia and also understands the outcomes of those activities. But I can assure the parliament and the Australian public, we maintain appropriate levels of oversight for the activities undertaken. Importantly, concurrence also means that Australia can withdraw agreement if the government considers that necessary. At a practical level, full knowledge and concurrence means: First, that Australia is to be consulted about any new purpose proposed for any activity, or a significant change to an existing purpose, and we will be advised of any significant change to expected outcomes. Second, it means that Australia will be briefed and advised on outcomes actually achieved. And finally, proposals for new equipment or significant upgrades to existing equipment, including communications links, will be advised in sufficient time to confirm that the changes align with mutually-agreed purposes, or to seek further clarification, if required. There is much work undertaken to ensure that the objectives of these practical steps are met. The Department of Defence regularly reviews the management and implementation of this policy to ensure \u2013 and be fully satisfied \u2013 that governance is effective and being appropriately and stringently adhered to. Australians who hold senior positions at these joint facilities, as well as at Australian facilities that are used by foreign governments, are fully and deeply integrated into decision-making and implementation processes. While the details of the policy and its implementation have evolved over time, to better reflect the changes in our national security environment and to keep pace with technological progress, the fundamental principles of full knowledge and concurrence have not changed, and we are never complacent about its application. Protecting and enhancing our economic wellbeing As outlined in the 2016 defence white paper, defending our maritime trade routes is part of Australia\u2019s primary strategic defence priorities. These maritime highways are the backbone of our foreign trade coming in and out of Australia. It is crucial for Australian jobs and our economy that these routes remain open and secure, with unimpeded freedom of access. Regional actions have the ability to adversely impact regional security and economic stability. Facilities such as Pine Gap help reduce this risk, in support of the rules-based global order, by providing early warning of potentially hostile activities and developments that threaten to destabilise the region. It is also important to recognise the real economic and social benefits these facilities have in regional Australia. Apart from the jobs generated directly by these facilities, workers contribute to local economies and form part of the social fabric of these communities. More than military and intelligence value While much of the public debate seems to centre on the military applications of US capabilities in Australia or their contributions to intelligence matters, these capabilities also play a crucial role in our everyday lives. In 2017, a new space surveillance radar reached full operational capability at the Harold E Holt facility. This radar serves as a dedicated sensor node in the Global Space Surveillance Network, in support of our Combined Space Operations cooperation with the US, United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. It will be joined by a new space surveillance telescope, which is scheduled to reach full operational capability in 2022. Together, this radar and telescope will identify and track objects in space, which will help satellite owners avoid collisions with space junk and other satellites. With so many aspects of Australian life and business reliant on satellites, if one were to be severely damaged or knocked out of orbit, that could have disastrous impacts on Australian individuals and businesses. As another example, the Learmonth solar observatory, also in Western Australia, monitors solar emissions, which helps to protect communications equipment from solar interference. This space weather facility is jointly operated by the Bureau of Meteorology and the US air force. Solar weather can affect transmission quality for services, such as mobile phone and internet networks as well as television and radio transmissions. Solar weather can also affect power grids, causing blackouts. Predicting solar weather is important because it allows organisations that own infrastructure, such as satellites, communication networks or power grids, to mitigate its impacts. This is particularly relevant as more people use wireless internet devices as part of their daily lives, whether that be for entertainment, education, social media or business. Our work with the US has also allowed us to share critical information. As a result, the intelligence we produce together has saved lives. It has saved American and Australian lives, not only on the battlefield, but it has saved civilian lives as well. The significant value of Australian facilities supporting United States capabilities While Pine Gap may be the highest-profile joint facility on Australian soil, it is not the only facility in Australia that is jointly operated with the US, or that hosts US defence activities and capabilities. The Joint Geological and Geophysical Research Station is another joint facility that Australia operates with the US in Alice Springs. This facility, run by Geoscience Australia and the US air force, was established in 1955 to monitor nuclear explosions during the cold war. Today, it performs a crucial role as part of the international monitoring system of the comprehensive test-ban treaty, which prohibits \u201cany nuclear weapon test explosion\u201d anywhere in the world. It is a little-known fact that this research station, in Alice Springs, detected and geolocated North Korea\u2019s sixth nuclear test, on 3 September 2017. Like Pine Gap, the Naval Communication Station Harold E Holt, in Exmouth, Western Australia, has also contributed to Australia\u2019s national security for over half a century. This Australian facility, which was previously jointly operated with the US navy until we assumed full control in the 1990s, provides communications for Australian and US submarines and ships. This includes communications for the submarine-based nuclear deterrence capabilities of the US in the Indo-Pacific, which are crucial to credible deterrence, a stable nuclear balance and our own security. Another important communications facility is the Australian Defence Satellite Communication Station in Geraldton, Western Australia, which hosts a ground station for US military satellite communications systems used by Australian and US forces on operations. This facility contributes to the safety of deployed Australian and US military personnel. The Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap \u2013 over 50 years of success The Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap has made \u2013 and continues to make \u2013 a critical contribution to the security of both Australia and the US. It represents one of the finest examples of collaboration, innovation and integration, and has delivered remarkable intelligence dividends to both our nations. As its name clearly states, Pine Gap is a \u201cjoint\u201d defence facility, run by the governments of both Australia and the US \u2013 as close and enduring partners. Pine Gap\u2019s workforce is split approximately 50:50, between Australians and Americans, with Australians holding key decision-making positions at the facility and having direct involvement in operations and tasking. Since its establishment in 1967, Pine Gap has evolved from its original cold war mission, focused on early warning for Soviet ballistic missiles, to meet new demands and new challenges. It has acquired cutting-edge, innovative technologies to do so. Pine Gap has become a central element of our intelligence cooperation with the US and it continues to have relevance in delivering intelligence on a range of contemporary security priorities, such as terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and monitoring foreign weapons development. Pine Gap also supports compliance monitoring with international arms control and disarmament agreements. By hosting this capability, Australia supports the verification of adherence to arms control agreements, in keeping with the government\u2019s comprehensive policy approach to arms control and counter-proliferation. It has provided monitoring and early warning capabilities of ballistic missile launches since 1999, following the closure of Joint Defence Facility Nurrungar. Reliable, early and accurate warning of ballistic missile launches provides a crucial contribution to global stability, with Pine Gap helping to provide reassurance against the possibility of a surprise missile attack. Much has been theorised about Pine Gap\u2019s role, for instance its contribution to US operations against terrorism. While the Australian government, as a matter of longstanding practice, does not comment on intelligence matters, Australians can be assured that the government has full oversight of activities undertaken at Pine Gap and that these activities are undertaken in accordance with Australian and international law. The Australia-United States Alliance \u2013 underpinning Australian security The United States is our most important ally. Our military forces work side-by-side around the world, to meet global security challenges and to promote peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. No other global power has values and interests more closely aligned with Australia\u2019s than the United States. The presence of US military forces across the Indo-Pacific plays a vital role in ensuring regional security, and the strategic and economic weight of the US is essential to the continued effective functioning of the rules-based global order. Australia\u2019s alliance with the US is enshrined in the Anzus treaty, signed on 1 September 1951. With the support of successive Australian and US governments, the alliance has grown in depth and complexity over time, and continues to deliver real benefits to both our countries. The alliance gives us unparalleled access to the most advanced technology, equipment and intelligence, which is central to maintaining the potency of the Australian defence force. Australia sources much of our most critical combat capability from the US. Australia would be unable to develop the range of high-end capabilities we need without the alliance. Crucially, the alliance also means that Australia benefits from the extended nuclear deterrence provided by the US. During the cold war, the US contributed to the security of its allies through its ability to respond with nuclear weapons if allies were attacked by the Soviet Union. Today, global geopolitics have changed, but the core principles of extended nuclear deterrence have not. Potential adversaries understand that an attack on Australia is an attack on the alliance. This brings me to an important point. Australia is not only a beneficiary of the US policy of extended nuclear deterrence, it is an active supporter of it, through our joint efforts with the US at Pine Gap and at other facilities, such as the Naval Communications Station Harold E Holt, and the Joint Geological and Geophysical Research Station. As the then-prime minister, Bob Hawke, noted in his public statement on Pine Gap in 1984, Australia should not claim the protection of nuclear deterrence without being willing to make a contribution to its effectiveness. Hosting these joint facilities and US strategic capabilities on our soil is Australia\u2019s important contribution to the alliance. Bear with me: Christopher Pyne has given an update on the joint operations Australia runs with the US, like Pine Gap. It is rare we are given public updates, so I am going to include the whole statement over the next few posts. The joint facilities we operate with the United States, such as the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap, as well as the Australian facilities that host US strategic capabilities, are some of the most tangible manifestations of the strength and depth of the Australia-United States alliance. However, due to the classified nature of some of the most sensitive work performed at these facilities, it is necessary that relatively few people are briefed on those roles and functions. It is therefore in the public interest that governments make periodic public statements on these facilities. Today, I want to update the parliament and the Australian public on the deliberate policy principles that govern these facilities and the contributions they make, not only to regional and global security, but to our own security and national prosperity. The public can have confidence that its government is acting lawfully and responsibly in overseeing such activities, and that Australia\u2019s continuing support for these activities is in our nation\u2019s best interests. In the House of Representatives the attorney general Christian Porter has introduced a few new bills, including one that makes changes to the foreign influence transparency scheme, which has only been up and running for two months. The most important change is the definition of \u201ccommunications activity\u201d would be changed to capture \u201cinformation or material being distributed to the public\u201d. That would mean that agents of foreign principals would have to register for distribution pamphlets, for example, in the election. It makes a few tune-ups for what the explanatory memorandum calls \u201cgaps\u201d in the reporting requirements. Apparently some reporting requirements were applied only to people who registered under the scheme, and that has to be extended to those who are \u201cliable to register\u201d. Oops. Doug Cameron, who will retire at the next election, had a few things to say about his estimates sparring partner, Michaelia Cash, this morning: Michaelia Cash is a disgraced minister, she has been demoted and my view is she should resign, This is a terrible cover-up that\u2019s going on in Senate estimates. When you have the Australian federal police saying that Michaelia Cash has not put statements in then that\u2019s good enough for me. This is the Australian federal police against a disgraced minister. Also Michael Keenan is in the same boat. He has not put a statement in and it\u2019s absolutely not acceptable to go to the Senate and argue that you have given a statement when the federal police said that is not the case. On two occasions they have refused to put statements in. This is a minister who just doesn\u2019t get it. She should resign, she should be open, she will probably have another option today if she appears at Senate estimates today to correct the record. The dairy wars have now descended into the major political parties pointing the finger at the other for defending [insert whatever] supermarket here. It\u2019s enough to make you lactose intolerant. The Department of Jobs and Small Business is appearing at Senate estimates and Labor\u2019s Doug Cameron spent the start of the hearing taking issue with what he calls another Michaelia Cash \u201cno show\u201d. Cash is the minister for small business, but is being represented by Liberal senator Linda Reynolds. Cameron says he\u2019d prefer to ask Cash questions about her portfolio, rather than a \u201cjunior minister\u201d. \u201cYou can insult me all you like,\u201d Reynolds tells him. \u201cShe should stop hiding and she should come here and front up,\u201d an angry Cameron says, prompting the committee to suspend briefly. A sign of things to come, I\u2019d suspect, as Cash will be appearing in this committee later today, according to Reynolds. Eventually, Cameron lets up and the committee moves to policy questions. The department\u2019s Nathan Smyth tells Labor senator Deb O\u2019Neill that 3,933 businesses have signed up to host PaTH interns since April 2017. The program, a Turnbull government initiative, was slammed by unions who said people were being paid $4 an hour. The government had promised 30,000 placements a year \u2013 with 18,000-20,000 businesses required to meet this aim. \u201cIs this a policy failure, it looks like one?\u201d O\u2019Neill says. Smyth tells the hearing that 30,000 figure was more of a \u201ccap\u201d than a target. We previously covered the poor take up rate in more detail here. Josh Frydenberg and Zed Seselja met with retirees upset about Labor\u2019s proposed changes to franking credits. Expect to hear more of their stories in question time today. Christian Porter has introduced amendments to counter-terrorism laws The overview of the bill, as according to the legislation: 1. The bill strengthens Australia\u2019s counter-terrorism framework by ensuring that the government has the means to protect the community from the risk of terrorist acts. 2. Schedule 1 of the bill contains measures to introduce new restrictions on the existing arrangements for bail and parole. This implements the agreement of the Council of Australian Governments at its meeting on 9 June 2017. Offenders who have links with, or have shown support for, terrorist activities will not be released on bail or parole unless they can show that there are exceptional circumstances that would justify their release into the community. 3. Schedule 2 of the bill makes amendments to improve the operation of the continuing detention order (CDO) scheme. These amendments address deficiencies in the existing CDO scheme to ensure that the commonwealth is able to seek the continued detention of terrorist offenders serving custodial sentences who are assessed by a judge in civil proceedings to present an unacceptable risk to the community at the time their sentences finish. Ugh. Now that I have wrestled with tech demons, I can tell you that as expected, the motion to suspend standing orders goes down, 69 to 74. The division is called \u2013 to see if Labor can suspend standing orders. It does not look like the Nationals will be backing it. David Gillespie is not a fan of Labor\u2019s plan for the dairy industry. Because he says most of it is already happening. Joel Fitzgibbon told the ABC this, this morning: There is no good just sitting back as a government expecting the market to work out these things for itself. It is clear that is not going to happen. We have waited too long for that. It is clear we are waiting with false hope. So we need to intervene, but we are not just talking about a minimum price: we are going to put into place a mandatory code of conduct to govern behaviour in the industry; we are going to drive energy prices down with some energy policy that returns investment certainty to the energy sector; and we are going to introduce a farm productivity and sustainability plan which helps again make a contribution towards getting the latest innovation out onto the farm to help farmers lift their productivity. And of course they are calling on the government to get the ACCC involved. Gillespie says: \u201cThey say they will refer milk pricing to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. They say they will support a mandatory code of conduct. This has all been done and the ACCC\u2019s key recommendation was a mandatory code of conduct, which farmers have asked for and we are delivering on,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAs the member for Lyne, I have continued to advocate directly with the ACCC and ministers about market failure not just in the dairy industry, but also other industries my constituents operate in, who have also suffered under competition law. \u201cThe Nationals have been prosecuting the case for changes to competition law for years and Labor has failed to support us.\u201d \u201cThey obviously now know that dairy farmers are doing it tough because they heard it on the news, and so they issue a press release. \u201cI have spent a lot of time with many of my dairy farmers who have given me a very accurate picture of the contractual arrangements they have had to endure. Some of the processors who they sell their milk to have clearly not been interested in their long term viability, nor have the major supermarkets who have also not understood the significant damage they have inflicted on the industry with their pathetic $1-a-litre milk campaigns. \u201cThe mandatory code of conduct which everyone has had an opportunity to help develop will provide a solid framework for the supply chain however it is going to take some time to work through the system when it comes into effect in the near future.\u201d \u201cThat is why I have been calling on the supermarkets and the processors to come to the party with measures that provide immediate relief for dairy farmers while a mandatory code of conduct is implemented and a fair dinkum milk price index can be established.\u201d \u201cHaving seen the positive response from Woolworths and the pathetic responses from Coles and Aldi, clearly there are some in this space who have no moral compass. \u201c ...I was hoping with a little pressure, the major supermarkets and the processors would all recognise the tough situation the dairy industry is in, particularly the producers, and taken steps to rectify some of the unsustainable farm gate prices they have offered.\u201d \u201cI have never been one to advocate for government running the market, but where there is market failure, it is my view that we must intervene to make sure the market works for everyone. Lyndal Curtis is back today, as Mike Bowers\u2019 \u201cwork experience kid\u201d. (Lyndal has about 25 years\u2019 experience in covering politics, which is why her and Bowers laugh every time one of them refers to her \u201cwork experience\u201d. She\u2019s picked up a camera and Bowers is helping her hone her naturally great eye) The Murray-Darling Basin Authority has released its official response to the Bret Walker-led royal commission ordered by the former South Australian government. It\u2019s basically a series of middle finger emojis in very professional terms. You can find the whole report here, but below is an excerpt which sets the tone: The MDBA was established under the Water Act 2007 (the Water Act) to develop, implement and monitor the Basin Plan, for the sustainable management of the Murray-Darling Basin\u2019s water resources. Management of a generally scarce and highly variable water resource, over such a large area and crossing political boundaries, is a challenging task. While many stakeholders support the concept of a Basin Plan, there is often sharp disagreement up and down the rivers, and across different stakeholder groups, about the appropriate Basin Plan settings. This is precisely why the MDBA was created. Our role as an independent statutory authority, fully funded by the Australian taxpayer and independent of any interest group, is to apply the best available science, feedback from the community and our own expert judgment, to recommend the best Basin Plan we can, consistent with the requirements of the Water Act. While the SARC Report contains some analysis that we support, our overwhelming view is that the principal conclusion of the report \u2013 that we should start all over again and remake the Basin Plan \u2013 is reckless and unwarranted. It would set back progress towards a healthy and sustainable Basin and cause substantial uncertainty for Basin communities.\u201d Labor is attempting to suspend standing orders to move a motion calling on government intervention for the dairy industry. Joel Fitzgibbon is leading this one. Labor is calling on the parliament to pass a motion getting the government to \u201ctask the CCC with testing the efficacy of a minimum farm gate milk price and to make recommendations on the best design options\u201d The big question \u2013 how will the Nationals MPs vote? Paul Karp has the latest on what Labor plans on doing in response to the banking royal commission: Banks and financial regulators would be forced to report every six months on their progress fixing cultural problems exposed by the royal commission under a plan proposed by Labor. Financial firms would also be named and shamed in decisions by the Australian Financial Complaints Authority when it decides in favour of customers if Labor is elected. On Tuesday Labor released bills to implement five Hayne royal commission recommendations before the election but the opposition is yet to win the crossbench votes needed to recall parliament and also faces a substantial pushback from mortgage brokers about its support for banning trailing commissions. Under the Labor plan, the big four banks, Australian Banking Association and financial regulators, Apra and Asic, will be required to develop royal commission implementation plans by 1 August. Stakeholders will have to report on their progress to Labor\u2019s proposed royal commission implementation taskforce in the treasury department every six months.\u201d And in case you missed it, Alan Jones has apologised. Again. Turns out practice really can make perfect. As Katharine Murphy reports: The controversial Sydney broadcaster Alan Jones has delivered an on-air apology to Malcolm Turnbull for branding him a \u201ctraitor to the nation\u201d during a program broadcast by Sky News in February. Jones delivered the unqualified apology, which is understood to be in response to a lawyer\u2019s letter from the former prime minister, at the start of his television show, Jones and Co, on Tuesday night. \u201cI went too far in my criticism,\u201d Jones told his viewers. \u201cI accused Mr Turnbull of being a traitor to the nation. \u201cI acknowledge that I had no justification for making that false statement and I unreservedly apologise to Mr Turnbull for doing so.\u201d This is happening in the parliament theatre today. Sydney\u2019s Treehouse Theatre brings children from refugee backgrounds together to share their own stories of fun, terror, recovery and resettlement. For one day only at Parliament House in Canberra, Suitcase Stories is a first-person theatre experience performed by young refugees from Afghanistan, Iraq and South Sudan, now attending Holroyd high school and Miller Technology high school. The students, who have all experienced the horror of war, trauma and persecution, perform their own true stories in a symphony of spoken word, music and movement. I\u2019m not sure if you caught the (slightly) super moon last night. Barnaby Joyce did. And received the ratio* he deserved for this effort. *The ratio, or ratioing, looks at the number of likes, retweets and replies a tweet gets. If the replies vastly outnumber the like or retweets, you know you\u2019ve sent a terrible tweet. Yesterday, in a doorstop, Bill Shorten responded to a question about the Christmas Island proposal with: If the medical treatment is required and it\u2019s delivered on Christmas Island and it makes people well, well that\u2019s fine. Which the government immediately seized on as a U-turn from Labor, given that Shorten had said \u201cthe opening of Christmas Island, I believe, was a political gesture designed to fuel domestic political unrest but I\u2019m worried that we\u2019ll have tragic consequences because this is a government addicted to slogans and fear\u201d, just last week. Tanya Plibersek was asked about it this morning. Tim Storer had a chat to the ABC this morning about the Nauruan government decision to ban medical transfers based on telehealth assessments. Storer introduced the amended bill in the Senate late last year, which eventually led to the medical evacuation bill which was passed last week. Well, I think the regulations have, as you just noted, have just been made. We\u2019ll see the impact of that in terms of how it affects the bill, but what is very important is that there\u2019s inadequate medical facilities on Nauru and PNG for the significant medical assessment and treatment that is required and that is why we have had transfers to Australia which, you know, for many of these people. That\u2019s what this legislation focuses on in terms of advice by doctors to the minister regarding individuals that should come to Australia for assessment and treatment. And what does he think about the Christmas Island decision (the government wants to send medical transfers to the Australian territory, rather than the mainland): I think it\u2019s very important to focus on what the facilities are on Christmas Island. Do they provide for the appropriate assessment and medical treatment of asylum seekers that are in need, assessed to be in need that are from our care on Nauru and PNG? It seems that the current facilities on Christmas Island are inadequate and bringing them up to be appropriate would come at great cost. If the government wishes to do so, then of course that is their prerogative, but, you know, it\u2019s something that I would, want to follow carefully. Meanwhile, Labor is not letting up on the Paladin contract, either. Shayne Neumann has sent the auditor general this letter this morning: Dear Auditor-General, I am writing to request an urgent audit into the circumstances surrounding the Department of Home Affairs\u2019 procurement of garrison support and welfare services in Papua New Guinea. In the course of the past week, the Australian Financial Review has highlighted significant concerns related to the companies contracted to provide these services \u2013 particularly letters of intent with Paladin Solutions Group and a subsequent contract with Paladin Holding Pte Ltd. The letters of intent and contract has resulted in the expenditure of $423 million of taxpayers\u2019 money. The original letters of intent with Paladin Solutions Group were undertaken under section 2.6 of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules \u2013 with the Department of Home Affairs using these provisions to approach Paladin Solutions Group directly \u2013 and Paladin Solutions Group only. At Senate Estimates yesterday, Department of Home Affairs officials claimed that they were \u201cdealing with an urgent situation\u201d when they signed an initial letter of intent with Paladin Solutions Group in September 2017 \u2013 with letters totalling $89 million. The Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs told the Senate Estimates committee, \u201cmy very strong preference would have been to have a long lead time, an open tender, a global search, assisted by specialised consultants and advisers.\u201d Despite this preference, a subsequent contract worth $333 million awarded to Paladin Holding Pte Ltd was signed on 28 February 2018 with no other providers considered \u2013 despite reports today indicating that other companies, such as Toll Holdings, were considering bidding. The ANAO\u2019s report 32 of 2016-2017 titled Offshore Processing Centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea: Contract Management of Garrison Support and Welfare Services concluded that the Department had \u201cfallen well short of effective contract management practice.\u201d This report was a damning indictment of the Department\u2019s management of these contracts and stated: - contracts \u201cwere established in circumstances of great haste to give effect to government policy decisions\u201d; - \u201cthe Department did not put in place effective mechanisms to manage the contracts\u201d; and - \u201ccontract variations totalling over $1 billion were made without a documented assessment of value for money.\u201d Labor is acutely aware of the current Government\u2019s abysmal management of Australian-funded regional processing centres and their failure to negotiate other third country resettlement options, leaving vulnerable people languishing in indefinite detention. Given the level of expenditure associated with these contracts, the Government\u2019s poor track-record, and the concerning reports and allegations related to the entities involved, I seek your urgent investigation of the circumstances surrounding these contract arrangements. I would be happy to discuss this issue at your earliest convenience. Happy hump day! Michaelia Cash turned up to Senate estimates late yesterday and insisted she had cooperated with the AFP investigation into who leaked the Australian Workers\u2019 Union raids to the media. But that came after federal police told the same Senates committee that Cash and Michael Keenan had not provided witness statements. The deputy AFP commissioner Leanne Close told the committee that both Keenan and Cash had been asked for witness statements but had declined, as was their legal right to do so. Cash provided a transcript of her answers to a previous Senate estimates hearing on the same issue. Things got testy. The Labor senator Murray Watt offered to escort Cash to a police station so she could make a statement. Cash also revealed she had not read the estimates transcript of when the AFP had been asked about her case from the previous day. Her reason? \u201cBecause I haven\u2019t.\u201d Cash told the Labor members of the committee she believed their attacks had been unfair: \u201cI am waiting now for an apology.\u201d Cash is back today. So that should be fun. Meanwhile, Nick McKenzie and Richard Baker from the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age have a new installment in the Helloworld saga, which caught up Mathias Cormann yesterday: Australia\u2019s US ambassador, Joe Hockey, asked embassy staff to meet with a corporate travel company before it lobbied for government work, even though the former treasurer is close friends with the company\u2019s chief executive and now a big shareholder. In April 2017, Mr Hockey told Washington embassy staff to meet with an executive from Helloworld, the listed travel services company managed by Andrew Burnes, Mr Hockey\u2019s good friend and federal Liberal Party treasurer.\u201d So what I am saying is today is not going to be boring. Mike Bowers is on deck already, as is Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp. You\u2019ll have everyone else in the Guardian\u2019s brains trust dropping in across the day as well. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

On Wednesday Icke issued a statement claiming he had been \u201cthe victim of a smear campaign from politicians who have been listening to special interest groups\u201d after community groups including the Anti-Defamation Commission and the Executive Council of Australian Jewry called on the government to revoke his visa. Icke said that his visa, issued in September, \u201chas now been thrown out at the last hour\u201d, blaming Coleman for a decision he said also cited his views on vaccinations and global warming. Quoting from the decision, Icke rejected the view that his tour poses \u201ca risk to the health, safety or good order of the Australian community or a segment of the Australian community\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s top corporate regulator is facing questions in parliament about his role at the investment bank Goldman Sachs when it became embroiled in the world\u2019s biggest financial scandal \u2013 the disappearance of billions of dollars from Malaysia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund 1MDB. James Shipton, the head of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, was Goldman Sachs\u2019 head of regulation in south-east Asia when the bank handled a series of bond offerings to raise $6.5bn for 1MDB. But much of the money disappeared and the 1MDB fund went bust, triggering money laundering investigations in at least five other countries and finally bringing down the Malaysian government. The US department of justice has alleged that more than $4.5bn was stolen from 1MDB by top officials of the fund and their associates between 2009 and 2014, with many of the ill-gotten gains spent in the US on property, works of art and even the making of the Leonardo diCaprio film The Wolf of Wall Street. Malaysia is suing Goldman Sachs for $7.5bn for its role in allegedly helping the misappropriation of the money, $681m of which ended up in a bank account of the now-deposed Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak. The former Goldman Sachs partner who was in charge of the bond deals, Tim Leissner, has admitted defrauding the Malaysian people.

Who was involved? \u201cTherefore due diligence is deeply flawed. If I was on the federal investigating team \u2013 and I\u2019ve been told they\u2019ve been in Goldman Sachs for two years \u2013 I would be asking: \u2018Why did you not know what was going on and what happened to the money?\u2019\u201d Whish-Wilson was also expected to raise questions about another Australian connection to the 1MDB scandal. Malaysian investigators have unearthed new details about irregularities with a bond sale carried out in 2009 for a precursor of 1MDB by a Malaysian bank called Am Bank, which is 24% owned by the Australian bank ANZ. According to a recent report by Bloomberg, the 2009 bond sale arranged for TIA involved bonds being sold at a large discount to insiders which were then quickly resold \u2013 some of them on the same day \u2013 at a large profit. Low Taek Jho, the fugitive Malaysian financier believed to be behind the 1MDB scam, was also allegedly the mastermind of the TIA scheme and reportedly profited from it to the tune of $126m. Sarawak Report, the campaigning group that first exposed the 1MDB scandal, says Am Bank was involved in the bond sale \u201cevery bit of the way\u201d and therefore ANZ has a case to answer about why the alleged corrupt dealing went ahead. Clare Rewcastle Brown, of the Sarawak Report, said: \u201cIt makes [ANZ\u2019s] position every bit as awkward as that of Goldman Sachs, which performed a similar role during the later bond issues by 1MDB leading to investigations by the FBI leading to criminal charges from Malaysia as well.\u201d It renewed calls for an investigaton by Asic into Am Bank\u2019s involvement. ANZ declined to comment. Malaysia has filed criminal charges against Leissner and another former Goldman employee, Roger Ng Chong Hwa, will be extradited to the US to face charges of helping misappropriate $2.7bn, bribing officials and giving false statements when helping to issue bonds. They are being charged alongside the former 1MDB employee Jasmine Loo Ai Swan and Low \u2013 also known as Jho Low \u2013 who is believed to be in hiding in China.",

Between them they provide a range of services that help vulnerable people get and maintain tenancies and live independently. The services are designed to help them stay physically and mentally well, and to navigate the complexity of daily life, from work to the benefits system. Without that support, the alternative too often can be homelessness, crime or family breakdown. As a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nl__m1cZlk\" title=\"\">powerful film</a> made by the coalition testifies, many of their clients, like Cavanne, believe that without support they would be dead.</p> <p>The coalition calculates that for every \u00a31 spent on the housing support contracts, \u00a37.50 is saved on wider services.

In 2011, 50 people were sleeping rough in the county\u2019s affluent south coast towns, compared with 94 in 2018. Stonepillow\u2019s hostels in Chichester and Bognor Regis have long waiting lists.

The consequence was catastrophic with every ceiling, wall and floor ruined. Since then, our insurance company, Legal &amp; General, has sent several builders to look at the damage but we feel the proposed repairs address only the superficial damage and have significant omissions. Since June, we have been asking for a surveyor to identify the full scale of any problems but this has not been done. The worry is that hidden issues, such as damaged wiring, rotting flooring and damp and mould will not be addressed, and we will be left with serious ongoing problems. Ten months since the flood we are still unable to return to our house, no repairs have started and we are beginning to despair of ever going back.

With the second-biggest selling album of the year after The Greatest Showman soundtrack (whose Hugh Jackman opens the Brits show tonight), human distillation of niceness George Ezra is a dead cert to win. Sam Smith\u2019s album feels like it came out three years ago, Craig David is more a vibes conduit than rounded artist, and Aphex Twin is not making startling enough music to cause an upset. But Giggs has used his extraordinarily resonant tones to become the biggest and best all-round rapper in the UK \u2013 capable of both delicate jabs and southpaw sledgehammers \u2013 and deserves this prize. <em>BBT</em></p> <p>Will win: George Ezra<br>Should win: Giggs</p> <h2><strong>British female</strong></h2> <p><strong>Florence + the Machine<br>Jorja Smith<br>Anne-Marie<br>Lily Allen<br>Jess Glynne</strong></p> <p>Anne-Marie will win this because she was one of Britain\u2019s only success stories of last year, and the Brits are all about the industry slapping itself on the back. Although success is relative: Speak Your Mind was the biggest UK debut of 2018, but it was only the UK\u2019s 26th biggest album last year (Queen and Abba\u2019s respective greatest-hits collections did better), and while she\u2019s engaging enough, Anne-Marie lacks a popstarry <em>je ne sais quoi</em>. Lily Allen should win: No Shame was a great album that didn\u2019t get the props \u2013 or exposure \u2013 it deserved, and just imagine her brilliantly bridge-burning acceptance speech. <em>LS</em></p> <p>Will win: Anne-Marie<br>Should win: Lily Allen</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65f99bf551d172f5e8bd172faef221eb06314121\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65f99bf551d172f5e8bd172faef221eb06314121/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Idles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Their breakthrough year?

It\u2019s good to see Idles nominated: their euphoric, positivist punk has proven an emotional release valve for people \u2013 ok, men \u2013 frustrated by austerity and anxiety, though the Bristol band are perhaps too noisy for Brits voters. Mabel\u2019s star continues its charismatic, circuitous path to the heavens but isn\u2019t quite there yet; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/09/ella-mai-i-dont-know-the-last-time-an-r-and-b-artist-was-recognised-at-the-brits\">Ella Mai</a>\u2019s emphatic US success hasn\u2019t yet translated beyond R&amp;B fans in the UK. So that leaves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/09/jorja-smith-did-amy-have-a-hit-with-frank-i-havent-had-one-and-im-not-bothered\">Jorja Smith</a>, whose emotionally rich album Lost &amp; Found takes Amy Winehouse\u2019s bruised temperament into the present day: she should triumph here even if she doesn\u2019t win the bigger prizes. <em>BBT</em></p> <p>Will win: Jorja Smith<br>Should win: Idles</p> <h2><strong>British group</strong></h2> <p><strong>Arctic Monkeys<br>Gorillaz<br>The 1975<br>Little Mix<br>Years &amp; Years</strong></p> <p>Arctic Monkeys probably made the most significant album, but the Brits aren\u2019t going to run the risk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/feb/20/alex-turners-brits-speech-what-it-all-meant\">another broken microphone</a> with Brexit stockpiling on the horizon. Gorillaz won last year, and shouldn\u2019t have done. Which leaves three pretty decent contenders: Years &amp; Years are ambitious pop heroes, but Palo Santo sadly sank without leaving much of an impact. The 1975 have won before, and would be worthy double winners \u2013 they feel like a true group in the sense that hundreds of thousands of kids plot their identities by them. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/05/little-mix-on-piers-morgan-body-shaming-and-simon-cowell\">Little Mix are yet to win</a>, and they\u2019ve led a much longer and more thrilling existence than you\u2019d expect from a talent-show group; given the dismally dull state of some of the other \u201cpop\u201d \u201cstars\u201d up for gongs tonight, they\u2019ll bring some much-needed uproar. <em>LS</em></p> <p>Will win: Little Mix<br>Should win: Little Mix</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"280f75a062217948794752a6adfaf908b2ccd92a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/280f75a062217948794752a6adfaf908b2ccd92a/0_0_8688_5792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Little Mix, nominated twice this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Little Mix, nominated twice this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>British video</strong></h2> <p><strong>Anne-Marie \u2013 2002<br>Calvin Harris &amp; Dua Lipa \u2013 One Kiss<br>Clean Bandit \u2013 Solo (feat.

Nicki Minaj)<br>Rita Ora \u2013 Let You Love Me<br>Rudimental \u2013 These Days (feat. Jess Glynne, Macklemore &amp; Dan Caplen)</strong></p> <p>Voted for by you at home, the British video category is a fight between fan armies. Little Mix probably has the strongest fanbase, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSOpiZo1BAA\">Woman Like Me</a> is a great video: the four-piece play sexy (obvs) delinquents shipped off to a surreal finishing school. They\u2019re putting in greater effort than most of their rivals: the One Kiss video resembles the \u201cpsychedelic\u201d projections from some parochial club; Jonas Blue and Rudimental appear to be in on some post-Brexit initiative to celebrate London\u2019s tourism potential; and Rita Ora and Liam Payne\u2019s 50 Shades track is a vision of Taylor Swift\u2019s pleasingly menacing Blank Space video reinvented for Valentine\u2019s Day by a witless Hallmark employee. Similarly derivative are Anne-Marie\u2019s 2002, in which she re-enacts the videos of the songs she mentions in the lyrics; Dua Lipa\u2019s IDGAF is a shameless rip-off of Christine and the Queens\u2019 Tilted video; and Ora\u2019s neon-hued Let You Love Me is very Beyonc\u00e9 circa 2013. The deserved winner is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JnfIa84TnU\">Clean Bandit\u2019s surrealist clip</a>, in which the boys do something hydroponic with bunny rabbits, while Grace is towed on a skateboard by a neon dog and pretends to masturbate, apparently in the throes of some Harry Potter-related fantasy if the Dementor-style special effects are anything to go by. <em>LS</em></p> <p>Will win: Little Mix \u2013 Woman Like Me (feat. Nicki Minaj)<br>Should win: Clean Bandit \u2013 Solo (feat. Demi Lovato)</p> <h2><strong>International group</strong></h2> <p><strong>The Carters<br>First Aid Kit<br>Brockhampton<br>Chic &amp; Nile Rodgers<br>Twenty-One Pilots</strong></p> <p>Do the Brits really think that Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z pairing up constitutes a group? It seems fairly insulting to the, you know, many excellent and well-established groups from around the world that a one-off husband-and-wife collaboration would beat them to this category, but never mind: they shouldn\u2019t win anyway, as let\u2019s be honest, nobody\u2019s still listening to Everything Is Love. The whole category seems devoid of inspiration: First Aid Kit? In this economy? Twenty-One Pilots and Nile Rodgers will turn up, which stands them in good stead to win. (Did Rodgers ever meet a press opportunity he didn\u2019t like?) But for sheer ingenuity and actually meaning something to young people\u2019s lives, the progressive and emotionally astute Texas rap collective <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/26/brockhampton-14-boyband-men-colour-rap-sing-gay-pop\">Brockhampton</a> should win. <em>LS</em></p> <p>Will win: Chic &amp; Nile Rodgers<br>Should win: Brockhampton</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6eef9ecfb625a1c04540d6bf47e51191f4bf30bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6eef9ecfb625a1c04540d6bf47e51191f4bf30bc/0_2158_5792_3475/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ariana Grande \u2013 the favourite for the international female category?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ariana Grande \u2013 the favourite for the international female category?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR/PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>International female</strong></h2> <p><strong>Cardi B<br>Camila Cabello<br>Christine and the Queens<br>Ariana Grande<br>Janelle Mon\u00e1e</strong></p> <p>There is barely any daylight between these five phenomenally talented women, who make this category easily the most high quality of the lot.

On earworming songwriting merit, Sigala and Paloma Faith\u2019s Lullaby would be a worthy winner, as would Ramz\u2019s Barking, and Calvin Harris and Dua Lipa\u2019s One Kiss, which could cause a rightful upset. It conjured the true feeling of a heatwave in its confident summer-dress sexiness, and having won everything last year, Lipa is clearly beloved by the Academy. BBT Will win: George Ezra \u2013 Shotgun Should win: Calvin Harris &amp; Dua Lipa \u2013 One Kiss British male Sam Smith Craig David Aphex Twin Giggs George Ezra This is more solidly wrapped up than a particularly satisfying episode of Midsomer Murders. With the second-biggest selling album of the year after The Greatest Showman soundtrack (whose Hugh Jackman opens the Brits show tonight), human distillation of niceness George Ezra is a dead cert to win. Sam Smith\u2019s album feels like it came out three years ago, Craig David is more a vibes conduit than rounded artist, and Aphex Twin is not making startling enough music to cause an upset. But Giggs has used his extraordinarily resonant tones to become the biggest and best all-round rapper in the UK \u2013 capable of both delicate jabs and southpaw sledgehammers \u2013 and deserves this prize. BBT Will win: George Ezra Should win: Giggs British female Florence + the Machine Jorja Smith Anne-Marie Lily Allen Jess Glynne Anne-Marie will win this because she was one of Britain\u2019s only success stories of last year, and the Brits are all about the industry slapping itself on the back. Although success is relative: Speak Your Mind was the biggest UK debut of 2018, but it was only the UK\u2019s 26th biggest album last year (Queen and Abba\u2019s respective greatest-hits collections did better), and while she\u2019s engaging enough, Anne-Marie lacks a popstarry je ne sais quoi. Lily Allen should win: No Shame was a great album that didn\u2019t get the props \u2013 or exposure \u2013 it deserved, and just imagine her brilliantly bridge-burning acceptance speech. LS Will win: Anne-Marie Should win: Lily Allen British breakthrough Mabel Idles Ella Mai Tom Walker Jorja Smith A pretty even category here, apart from Tom Walker, who has a very strong voice but you get the feeling even his close mates struggle to recall his face. It\u2019s good to see Idles nominated: their euphoric, positivist punk has proven an emotional release valve for people \u2013 ok, men \u2013 frustrated by austerity and anxiety, though the Bristol band are perhaps too noisy for Brits voters. Mabel\u2019s star continues its charismatic, circuitous path to the heavens but isn\u2019t quite there yet; Ella Mai\u2019s emphatic US success hasn\u2019t yet translated beyond R&amp;B fans in the UK. So that leaves Jorja Smith, whose emotionally rich album Lost &amp; Found takes Amy Winehouse\u2019s bruised temperament into the present day: she should triumph here even if she doesn\u2019t win the bigger prizes. BBT Will win: Jorja Smith Should win: Idles British group Arctic Monkeys Gorillaz The 1975 Little Mix Years &amp; Years Arctic Monkeys probably made the most significant album, but the Brits aren\u2019t going to run the risk of another broken microphone with Brexit stockpiling on the horizon. Gorillaz won last year, and shouldn\u2019t have done. Which leaves three pretty decent contenders: Years &amp; Years are ambitious pop heroes, but Palo Santo sadly sank without leaving much of an impact. The 1975 have won before, and would be worthy double winners \u2013 they feel like a true group in the sense that hundreds of thousands of kids plot their identities by them. But Little Mix are yet to win, and they\u2019ve led a much longer and more thrilling existence than you\u2019d expect from a talent-show group; given the dismally dull state of some of the other \u201cpop\u201d \u201cstars\u201d up for gongs tonight, they\u2019ll bring some much-needed uproar. LS Will win: Little Mix Should win: Little Mix British video Anne-Marie \u2013 2002 Calvin Harris &amp; Dua Lipa \u2013 One Kiss Clean Bandit \u2013 Solo (feat. Demi Lovato) Dua Lipa \u2013 IDGAF Jax Jones \u2013 Breathe (feat. Ina Wroldsen) Jonas Blue \u2013 Rise (feat. Jack &amp; Jack) Liam Payne &amp; Rita Ora \u2013 For You (Fifty Shades Freed) Little Mix \u2013 Woman Like Me (feat. Nicki Minaj) Rita Ora \u2013 Let You Love Me Rudimental \u2013 These Days (feat. Jess Glynne, Macklemore &amp; Dan Caplen) Voted for by you at home, the British video category is a fight between fan armies. Little Mix probably has the strongest fanbase, and Woman Like Me is a great video: the four-piece play sexy (obvs) delinquents shipped off to a surreal finishing school. They\u2019re putting in greater effort than most of their rivals: the One Kiss video resembles the \u201cpsychedelic\u201d projections from some parochial club; Jonas Blue and Rudimental appear to be in on some post-Brexit initiative to celebrate London\u2019s tourism potential; and Rita Ora and Liam Payne\u2019s 50 Shades track is a vision of Taylor Swift\u2019s pleasingly menacing Blank Space video reinvented for Valentine\u2019s Day by a witless Hallmark employee. Similarly derivative are Anne-Marie\u2019s 2002, in which she re-enacts the videos of the songs she mentions in the lyrics; Dua Lipa\u2019s IDGAF is a shameless rip-off of Christine and the Queens\u2019 Tilted video; and Ora\u2019s neon-hued Let You Love Me is very Beyonc\u00e9 circa 2013. The deserved winner is Clean Bandit\u2019s surrealist clip, in which the boys do something hydroponic with bunny rabbits, while Grace is towed on a skateboard by a neon dog and pretends to masturbate, apparently in the throes of some Harry Potter-related fantasy if the Dementor-style special effects are anything to go by. LS Will win: Little Mix \u2013 Woman Like Me (feat. Nicki Minaj) Should win: Clean Bandit \u2013 Solo (feat. Demi Lovato) International group The Carters First Aid Kit Brockhampton Chic &amp; Nile Rodgers Twenty-One Pilots Do the Brits really think that Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z pairing up constitutes a group? It seems fairly insulting to the, you know, many excellent and well-established groups from around the world that a one-off husband-and-wife collaboration would beat them to this category, but never mind: they shouldn\u2019t win anyway, as let\u2019s be honest, nobody\u2019s still listening to Everything Is Love. The whole category seems devoid of inspiration: First Aid Kit? In this economy? Twenty-One Pilots and Nile Rodgers will turn up, which stands them in good stead to win. (Did Rodgers ever meet a press opportunity he didn\u2019t like?) But for sheer ingenuity and actually meaning something to young people\u2019s lives, the progressive and emotionally astute Texas rap collective Brockhampton should win. LS Will win: Chic &amp; Nile Rodgers Should win: Brockhampton International female Cardi B Camila Cabello Christine and the Queens Ariana Grande Janelle Mon\u00e1e There is barely any daylight between these five phenomenally talented women, who make this category easily the most high quality of the lot. But if push comes to shove, Mon\u00e1e remains a cult artist whose brilliant iconography ultimately does the heavy lifting for her songwriting, and perhaps Cabello isn\u2019t quite in the same super-league as Cardi B or Ariana Grande, either of whom would be worthy winners. Grande is ultimately a much bigger artist in the UK, though, and earned giant goodwill for her charity concert in the wake of the Manchester arena attack \u2013 not to mention for songs of the calibre of Thank U, Next. Christine and the Queens\u2019 album was the critics\u2019 hit of 2018, though, so could sneak up the inside. BBT Will win: Ariana Grande Should win: Cardi B International male Drake Eminem Kamasi Washington Shawn Mendes Travis Scott Unfortunately for Shawn Mendes, there aren\u2019t any tween girls in the voting bloc so he\u2019s going to struggle here, and Kamasi Washington, whose contribution to jazz\u2019s cultural resurgence really cannot be underestimated, still ultimately plays jazz. Travis Scott made 2018\u2019s best rap album in Astroworld, and finally made an impact on the UK charts, but he too will suffer from older generations of voters peering over their reading glasses wondering who on Earth he is. Eminem, still a stadium-filling prospect, pulled himself out of a stupor with surprise album Kamikaze and stands a chance \u2013 but who can really touch Drake, who scored three UK No 1s last year, all of them witty and playfully anthemic. BBT Will win: Drake Should win: Drake.",

The government blamed the Taliban for banning immunisations and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/08/afghan-taliban-bans-polio-vaccination-teams-southern-helmand-province\">launching attacks on vaccination teams</a>.</p> <p>Efforts by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative \u2013 which is supported by the World Health Organization, Unicef, Rotary International and NGOs, along with national governments of polio-affected countries \u2013 have yielded results. Since 2015, the number of cases have been steadily declining.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces\">Pakistan government figures</a>, there were 54 reports of poliovirus in 2015, followed by 20 in 2016 and eight in 2017. But there was an increase in numbers last year, when a dozen cases were reported throughout the country, with 11 of them coming from the border regions.</p> <p>Aziz Memon, the national chair of the Pakistan Polio Plus Committee, said the government had increased the number of manned permanent transit posts, across the Pakistan/Afghanistan border, where children can be vaccinated against the virus.</p> <p>By the end of December, <a href=\"https://www.rotary.org/en/new-polio-strategy-working-pakistan\">1.6 million children</a> had been vaccinated at more than 380 such points. </p> <p>According to Memon, conflict, political insecurity and remoteness of areas, combined with a highly mobile population and logistical challenges, are significant obstacles to Pakistan eradicating polio.</p> <p>\u201cCross-border vaccination is critical to our programme in the fight against polio. The mass influx of population has caused many to fall through the cracks and families with children with low routine and no supplementary immunisation are the real challenge to the programme,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The difficult geographical terrain between North and South Waziristan and south-eastern Afghanistan has been the most difficult to reach for immunisation teams.</p> <p>The committee\u2019s current target is to immunise high risk populations in the border towns of Peshawar/Torkham in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Chaman/Spin Boldik in Balochistan. These areas are home to nomads, seasonal and economic migrants, and agricultural migrant labourer families.</p> <p>The storage capacity of vaccines in high temperatures in these areas has been a challenge. But researchers from the Southern University of California say they have found a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/27/freeze-drying-polio-vaccine-ipv-nigeria-pakistan\">new method</a> of storing inactive poliovirus vaccine (IPV) that maintains its effectiveness in such weather conditions.</p> <p>There has been a <a href=\"http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces\">96% reduction</a> in the number of polio cases in Pakistan since 2014. According to government figures 38.7 million children under five have been <a href=\"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/403908-last-nationwide-polio-vaccination-campaign-of-2018-begins-today\">immunised in routine national immunisation days</a>.</p> <p>Polio is a highly infectious, disabling and potentially deadly disease, contracted through the poliomyelitis virus in areas with poor sanitation. It spreads through contaminated food and water. There is no cure, and the disease mainly affects young children, so early immunisation is the only defence.</p> <p>Consequently, reaching children at the right age is a principal focus of the immunisation teams. The vaccine is given to children in four doses between the ages of two months and six years.</p> <p>In 2017 Pakistan started building a fence along its border with Afghanistan. While the aim is largely political, to limit militant incursions from either sides, the government also claims this will help stop cross-border transmission of polio.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The unmonitored movement of people across the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan threatens efforts to eradicate polio from the two countries, as the year\u2019s first cases of the virus are recorded in the volatile region. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative said people travelling through unchecked crossings is believed to be one of the main causes of the spread of the disease in the area. Pakistan and Afghanistan, along with Nigeria, are the only three countries in the world where polio remains endemic. Last month, the year\u2019s first case of the wild poliovirus in Pakistan was reported by the Bajaur Agency in the country\u2019s federally administered tribal area, bordering Afghanistan. The virus was also found in the border towns of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces. While the border areas are the main source of concern, cases were also reported in January in Punjab province. Since the start of the polio eradication programme in Pakistan in 1994, virus cases have been consistently reported along the 2,430km-stretch of the border, from main towns and cities to remote villages. The worst outbreak of polio in Pakistan was recorded in 2014, when 202 cases were reported. The government blamed the Taliban for banning immunisations and launching attacks on vaccination teams. Efforts by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative \u2013 which is supported by the World Health Organization, Unicef, Rotary International and NGOs, along with national governments of polio-affected countries \u2013 have yielded results. Since 2015, the number of cases have been steadily declining. According to Pakistan government figures, there were 54 reports of poliovirus in 2015, followed by 20 in 2016 and eight in 2017. But there was an increase in numbers last year, when a dozen cases were reported throughout the country, with 11 of them coming from the border regions. Aziz Memon, the national chair of the Pakistan Polio Plus Committee, said the government had increased the number of manned permanent transit posts, across the Pakistan/Afghanistan border, where children can be vaccinated against the virus. By the end of December, 1.6 million children had been vaccinated at more than 380 such points. According to Memon, conflict, political insecurity and remoteness of areas, combined with a highly mobile population and logistical challenges, are significant obstacles to Pakistan eradicating polio. \u201cCross-border vaccination is critical to our programme in the fight against polio. The mass influx of population has caused many to fall through the cracks and families with children with low routine and no supplementary immunisation are the real challenge to the programme,\u201d he said. The difficult geographical terrain between North and South Waziristan and south-eastern Afghanistan has been the most difficult to reach for immunisation teams. The committee\u2019s current target is to immunise high risk populations in the border towns of Peshawar/Torkham in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Chaman/Spin Boldik in Balochistan. These areas are home to nomads, seasonal and economic migrants, and agricultural migrant labourer families. The storage capacity of vaccines in high temperatures in these areas has been a challenge. But researchers from the Southern University of California say they have found a new method of storing inactive poliovirus vaccine (IPV) that maintains its effectiveness in such weather conditions. There has been a 96% reduction in the number of polio cases in Pakistan since 2014. According to government figures 38.7 million children under five have been immunised in routine national immunisation days. Polio is a highly infectious, disabling and potentially deadly disease, contracted through the poliomyelitis virus in areas with poor sanitation. It spreads through contaminated food and water. There is no cure, and the disease mainly affects young children, so early immunisation is the only defence. Consequently, reaching children at the right age is a principal focus of the immunisation teams. The vaccine is given to children in four doses between the ages of two months and six years. In 2017 Pakistan started building a fence along its border with Afghanistan. While the aim is largely political, to limit militant incursions from either sides, the government also claims this will help stop cross-border transmission of polio.",

This is the one place you can do it quickly. If you want something, we can make it in a day or two \u2013 probably it would take a month in the US or other countries. We are very quick and very cheap. So the value is very high for Seoul citizens and the industry \u2013 but Seoul municipality doesn\u2019t understand that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Under the terms of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/nov/01/seoul-south-korea-architecture-biennale-sewoon-sangga-skygarden\">Sewoon Sangga</a> regeneration project, the shops are being compensated for four months\u2019 worth of revenue. Given many of them conduct business in cash, they are likely to receive much less than their true value. Nor can they scatter around the city and expect to survive: many landlords aren\u2019t keen on dirt and noise, and moving would also separate them from their biggest clients \u2013 each other.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"407652b9c1437710efdfd2607b2bc7ac2c6c36b2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/407652b9c1437710efdfd2607b2bc7ac2c6c36b2/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jang Jong-il, 60, in his wooden model workshop in Euljiro, Seoul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jang Jong-il, 60, in his wooden model workshop in Euljiro, Seoul.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jun Michael Park</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Jang Jong-il, 60, in his wooden model workshop in Euljiro</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>These shops are a key part of Seoul\u2019s healthy functioning, past and present, says Park Eun-seon, urban activist and founder of the collective Listen to the City.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis area is now the oldest area in Seoul. Everything else is postwar. Here we have some originals. The people worked here for a long time, making their own history \u2013 and now the government wants to make it offices and apartments. Ridiculous.\u201d</p> \n<p>She points out that the government has past form in demolishing first and asking questions later. In 2003, when the Cheonggyecheon stream was originally developed, more than 30,000 street vendors were moved out after an elevated highway was demolished to restore the original river underneath. The waterway is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/25/story-cities-reclaimed-stream-heart-seoul-cheonggyecheon\">a favourite socialising spot</a> for Seoulites, and its success helped propel then-mayor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/05/south-korean-president-jailed-15-years-corruption-lee-myung-bak\">Lee Myung-bak</a> to the presidency.</p> \n<p>But the area around the redeveloped stream is also prime real estate. It stretches roughly 10km from City Hall in the west to Dongdaemun Design Plaza, a spaceship-like exhibition hall designed by Zaha Hadid.

      "bodyText": "From the main street, the Euljiro neighbourhood doesn\u2019t look like much: some shabby retail stores, cold-noodle restaurants, a Starbucks. Enter one of the small alleys, however, and you\u2019ll find yourself in a kind of manufacturing anthill: thousands upon thousands of shops, each crammed to the rafters with bolts, circuit boards, iron castings, gauges, wires, lights, switches, tools and innumerable tiny objects that defy description. This incredible warren of machinists is the manufacturing heart of Seoul. There are 10,000 shops here, with 50,000 tradespeople, many of whom have been working here since the 1950s and were integral to South Korea\u2019s postwar economic boom, the so-called Miracle on the Han. But even as the tour guides at nearby Jongmyo Shrine extol the history, foibles and eating habits of the long-dead Joseon dynasty, here in Euljiro a living history is about to be unceremoniously wiped out. Seoul is growing fast. Although the city will only enter the United Nations\u2019 official list of megacities \u2013 those with more than 10 million residents \u2013 in 2024, the wider metropolitan area is already home to 25 million. Euljiro against the backdrop of newer and taller buildings In October, the city government gave the green light to Hanho Construction to knock these shops down, as part of a huge plan to redevelop the area around Seoul\u2019s popular Cheonggyecheon stream. The shopkeepers will be evicted and the ecosystem of 10,000 shops destroyed. Apartment buildings will be erected in their place. The process has already begun. \u201cI\u2019m panicking,\u201d says Kim Hak-ryul, 60, whose shop, Shina Casting, makes iron moulds. \u201cThere\u2019s no place to go. We cannot really move to other places \u2013 this is an ecosystem.\u201d Most of the shops in Euljiro sell primarily to each other, working together to solve problems and build prototypes for the industrial and electronics sectors that are so important to the South Korean economy. Kim Hak-ryool (left), and Mr Baek in their metal workshops \u201cThis area is all handmade. It\u2019s a critical place for making samples for big companies like Samsung or LG,\u201d says Kim, who took the shop over from the founding Shina family 15 years ago and kept the name out of pride for its long heritage. \u201cWe can do very diverse work for very small amounts. This is the one place you can do it quickly. If you want something, we can make it in a day or two \u2013 probably it would take a month in the US or other countries. We are very quick and very cheap. So the value is very high for Seoul citizens and the industry \u2013 but Seoul municipality doesn\u2019t understand that.\u201d Under the terms of the Sewoon Sangga regeneration project, the shops are being compensated for four months\u2019 worth of revenue. Given many of them conduct business in cash, they are likely to receive much less than their true value. Nor can they scatter around the city and expect to survive: many landlords aren\u2019t keen on dirt and noise, and moving would also separate them from their biggest clients \u2013 each other. Jang Jong-il, 60, in his wooden model workshop in Euljiro These shops are a key part of Seoul\u2019s healthy functioning, past and present, says Park Eun-seon, urban activist and founder of the collective Listen to the City. \u201cThis area is now the oldest area in Seoul. Everything else is postwar. Here we have some originals. The people worked here for a long time, making their own history \u2013 and now the government wants to make it offices and apartments. Ridiculous.\u201d She points out that the government has past form in demolishing first and asking questions later. In 2003, when the Cheonggyecheon stream was originally developed, more than 30,000 street vendors were moved out after an elevated highway was demolished to restore the original river underneath. The waterway is now a favourite socialising spot for Seoulites, and its success helped propel then-mayor Lee Myung-bak to the presidency. But the area around the redeveloped stream is also prime real estate. It stretches roughly 10km from City Hall in the west to Dongdaemun Design Plaza, a spaceship-like exhibition hall designed by Zaha Hadid. Euljiro is caught in the middle. Inside the workshops of Euljiro Park worries that the fight will end in violence, like many previous regeneration projects. In 2010 six people, including one policeman, died in a fire during an eviction, and then next year she and her peers occupied the Mari Cafe, one of the Euljiro restaurants slated for demolition. She says anonymous thugs came to threaten them every night, demanding they leave: \u201cThey beat you, and swear at you, and pee, and throw poo. In front of ladies they take down their pants and pee in front of you.\u201d On 3 August 2011, they stepped it up. \u201cIt was a terrible night. We did a film exhibition in the Mari Cafe. So they sent 200 thugs. And then we get beaten, and policemen shut the door. Can you believe that? We were inside to protect the building, because \u2026 you have to occupy it, you have to squat it. Two hundred gangsters came in and [the police closed the gate]. It was a mess. Many people got injured.\u201d The \u2018thugs\u2019 who beat up activists trying to occupy the Mari Cafe in 2011 There are no signs of violence in the current dispute, nor any suggestion that Hanho Construction was involved in any past confrontations, but the Korea Times has reported that the firm has sent aggressive letters to shop owners, bypassing their official tenants\u2019 association. Many of the letters asked for double rent, or claimed damages of up to 500m won (\u00a3343,000) for unspecified obstruction, the newspaper said. \u201cIn Korea, this urban substance is still very volatile, very fragile. It could be wiped out depending on any political regime,\u201d says Minsuk Cho, an architect who returned to Seoul from New York in 2003 to establish the firm Mass Studies. \u201cThis is still unfortunately a country addicted to real estate. It\u2019s so sad that young kids nowadays, [if you ask them] what do you want to be in the future, it used to be president and astronauts, now it\u2019s like, \u2018I want to be a building owner.\u2019 It\u2019s neo-feudal. Or a K-pop star \u2026\u201d However, he does sees some cause for optimism in Korea\u2019s history of protest. In 2016, for example, a series of demonstrations in Seoul against corruption swelled to more than 2 million people, according to organisers\u2019 estimates. Demolition in progress \u201cIt was like Rio carnival,\u201d Cho recalls. \u201cPeople are really fed up, but they develop this mass expression, [and express] their common interests and common concerns in a very festive way. You think [South] Korea is just another Asian country that\u2019s really top-down, but we\u2019re really not like that. Although something like a quarter of GDP is from Samsung, and half of national GDP is by these mega chaebol business conglomerates, we still have a country full of tiny shop owners who like it that way \u2013 they like the autonomy.\u201d That David-and-Goliath tension may be coming to a head in Euljiro. In January, following several protests in front of City Hall and a public outcry over the fate of a few well-loved restaurants, the mayor, Park Won-soon, a former civic activist himself, announced a formal review of the regeneration plan. Although the redevelopment has not been cancelled, he has asked a commission of experts to suggest alterations. The obvious alteration would be to renovate the area rather than knocking it all down, suggests Kim of Shina Casting. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re destroying everything,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone here has very different skills \u2013 30- and 40-year-old skills \u2013 it\u2019s unique. We are a community, and this is destructive.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

      "bodyText": "Winning tip: Cumberland Caverns, Tennessee, US Three hundred feet underground is the last place on earth I would expect to experience my most memorable gig. Cumberland Caverns in McMinnville Tennessee is a cave experience with quite a difference. Bands perform in a huge cave called the Volcano Room, where you are seated with the most amazing rock formations all around you. A colossal chandelier hangs from the ceiling and the acoustics are the most natural and crystal-clear I have ever heard. I saw Aaron Lee Tasjan perform there and his voice sounded just incredible. I was also glad of the delicious cave chilli. \u2022 cumberlandcaverns.com jordan bailey Rocky Top, Tokyo I love Rocky Top in Ginza. It is a tiny bluegrass club up three flights of stairs between Ginza and Shimbashi stations. The acts are mostly local but the standard of playing is quite high (although the singing in English can be a bit ropy). The club has been there forever, and the walls are covered with an incredible who\u2019s who of photos and tributes from musicians passing through, with everybody from Bill Monroe on. There is usually a 2,000 yen (\u00a314) cover for the music, but the food and drink are cheap by Tokyo standards. On Facebook Dave Freak Show, Essen, Germany Freak Show is a scuzzy, underground bar, which can hold about 200 at a push. The bands play inside the mouth of a shark. They sell a lot of different beers and have regular beer tasting evenings. It costs between nothing and \u20ac20 depending on the band. Music is usually metal and punk, but can also include ska and even country. The audience are about 10cm from the band and it can get ferociously loud. Just as rock music should be. Bands like Powersolo and the Morlocks were particularly good. \u2022 freakshow-bar.de Jess Phillips Going Om, Singapore I love Going Om, on Haji Lane, in Singapore \u2013 it\u2019s so small inside that the acts play on the street outside. It\u2019s on a tiny street that feels like you\u2019ve stepped back in time in the heart of such a modern city. In a place that has so many rules and regulations, Goin Om stays authentically soulful. It\u2019s free to get in most nights, the drinks are fairly cheap for Singapore, and you\u2019ll inevitably end up dancing in the street. They also serve amazing cakes and juices and the bar staff are some of the friendliest I\u2019ve met. \u2022 going-om.com.sg Lauren Bouttel Le Sirius, Lyon A set of boat bars \u2013 p\u00e9niches \u2013 line the banks of the Rhone in Lyon. Throughout the year locals flock there to catch up with friends, relax on the river banks, drink and people watch. Le Sirius is one of these bars, but it\u2019s also a free, floating gig venue. It\u2019s the perfect place to catch a local band, have a drink, dance to live rock, swing or jazz and soak up the atmosphere of France\u2019s second city. Visit in the summer and recover post-gig by chilling out on the picturesque river banks. \u2022 Entry from about \u20ac5, lesirius.com Maddy Miller Bovine Sex Club, Toronto The implausibly named Bovine Sex Club features neither cows nor explicit acts of sex.

Instead of trying to replace the Irish border backstop, the prime minister will pursue legal assurances that it will not permanently bind the UK into a customs union.</p> <p>If May and Jean-Claude Juncker can agree a possible way forward, officials will start work on the technical and legal practicalities. The goal is for Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, to be able to change his legal advice to the government, which currently states the backstop could mean a permanent customs union. Cox is expected to give a speech later this week setting out his thinking. With time running out, cabinet was updated yesterday on the option of a no-deal Brexit.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Legal fix sought to rule out customs limbo Hello, it\u2019s Warren Murray updating you on matters of moment and import this Wednesday morning. \u201cAlternative arrangements\u201d and the \u201cMalthouse compromise\u201d have been declared dead as Theresa May returns to Brussels today. Instead of trying to replace the Irish border backstop, the prime minister will pursue legal assurances that it will not permanently bind the UK into a customs union. If May and Jean-Claude Juncker can agree a possible way forward, officials will start work on the technical and legal practicalities. The goal is for Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, to be able to change his legal advice to the government, which currently states the backstop could mean a permanent customs union. Cox is expected to give a speech later this week setting out his thinking. With time running out, cabinet was updated yesterday on the option of a no-deal Brexit. A cabinet source said the general mood in the room had noticeably turned against no deal as a negotiating tactic. After Honda confirmed its Swindon plant\u2019s closure, a former UK ambassador to Tokyo has told the Guardian overnight that it is \u201cfanciful\u201d to suggest Brexit did not play a part in the decision. Lord Mandelson, the former Labour business secretary, writes today that getting a deal still won\u2019t be enough to end the uncertainty that is causing British business to haemorrhage. \u201cIf we leave the EU at the end of March on May\u2019s terms, the exact same argument will simply begin all over again on 1 April: whether we are going to be close to or distant from the EU, aligned or not with single market rules, in a customs union or not, assuming control of our policies or becoming an EU regulatory satellite, and whether we are going to have an independent trade policy or not.\u201d * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; The home secretary is seeking to revoke the UK citizenship of Shamima Begum, who joined Isis at 15 and has just given birth in a Syrian refugee camp. The revocation may face legal challenge \u2013 her parents are from Bangladesh but she is British-born and under international law cannot be left stateless. &gt; The Independent Group of ex-Labour MPs has been criticised for registering as a limited company rather than a political party. The group says it will follow electoral law on donations. Joan Ryan, the Enfield North MP, has become its eighth member. &gt; Thousands of people in France have joined protests against antisemitism after Jewish graves were painted with swastikas. The government has warned antisemitism is \u201cspreading like poison\u201d. In recent weeks shots have been fired at a synagogue and prominent Jewish people publicly vilified. &gt; Bernie Sanders has announced he will once again run for the Democratic nomination and the US presidency. Asked what will be different about his 2020 campaign, Sanders replied: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win.\u201d * * * Plastic bullet bill \u2013 Scotland Yard has tripled its spending on plastic bullets in a single year, according to figures seen by the Guardian. The figures have emerged amid growing fears about the potential for a no-deal Brexit to result in civil disorder. In policing jargon they are known as \u201cattenuating energy projectiles\u201d (AEPs). \u201cIt is very concerning that police forces would want to stockpile such weapons,\u201d said Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary. Over the years plastic bullets have been linked to the deaths in Northern Ireland of at least 17 people, eight of whom were children. * * * Young people\u2019s health plight \u2013 Young Britons are dying from asthma at a higher rate than in any other European country, according to a study. Researchers say the UK is languishing near the bottom of an international league table for a host of problems among the young like obesity and lack of exercise. There are concerns the age group has been overlooked as being largely fit and healthy, when in fact almost 20% of 16- to 24-year-olds in the UK have a chronic health problem. In other health coverage today, we look at the painful plight of women and girls suffering the life-changing consequences of chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs) \u2013 and meet the doctor who has uncovered the failings of routine UTI testing as he pioneers a promising new approach to treatment. Separately, researchers say cervical cancer could be eliminated by the end of this century if high rates of HPV vaccination and screening can be achieved. * * * Push for green farming \u2013 Europe could feed its growing population entirely through organic and environmentally friendly agriculture, according to a scientific paper. Pesticides that are linked to a decline in insect populations could be phased out, argues the IDDRI thinktank, and greenhouse gas emissions radically reduced through \u201cagroecological farming\u201d \u2013 using ecological principles first and chemicals last in agriculture. More than half the EU\u2019s cereals and oilseed crops are fed to animals. The study models a future in which meat production would be cut by 40%, with the greatest reductions in grain-fed pork and poultry, and the European diet oriented towards plant-based proteins and pasture-fed livestock. It is being published in parallel with the UK launch of the Eat-Lancet \u201cplanetary health diet\u201d. * * * No flossing over it \u2013 Epic Games, the makers of Fortnite, have taken legal action against the organisers of a disastrous live event based on the computer game. An estimated 2,800 people turned up at Norfolk showground for Fortnite Live on Saturday, but there was only space for four children to practise archery at the same time and one climbing wall tower, which could accommodate three climbers. Epic Games said it was \u201cnot in any way associated with the event that took place in Norwich and we\u2019ve issued a claim against the organisers in the high court of London\u201d. Shaun Lord, the organiser, said 19 staff failed to turn up and ticket refunds were given on an \u201cindividual basis\u201d.

Barcelona failed to score despite managing 25 shots in a goalless stalemate at Lyon in their last-16 first leg, leaving the tie finely balanced. Jonny May is the most improved player in world rugby and, with Wales up next for England, he admits his searing displays now constitute a psychological barrier for opposition teams. England are hot favourites for the five-match, 50-over series against West Indies but their captain, Eoin Morgan, is taking nothing for granted. Lando Norris, who took to the track for the first time as a Formula One driver in testing on Tuesday, capped a strong performance by setting the second-fastest time.

      "body": "<h2>Area NYC: the buzzy brand blowing up this season</h2> <p>Generally, when fashion editors are prepared to get wet to watch a show, buzz status is bestowed. This happened on the rainy roof of Seward Park high school on the Lower East Side last September, with New York-based Area, a brand on the radar of style magazines since it was founded in 2016. This collection saw it continue on a journey through pop culture. Set to the sensual melodies of Estonian soul artist Velly Joonas, remixed by the Late Night Tales collective, designers Piotrek Panszczyk and Beckett Fogg captivated the audience with a collection that felt fresh yet grounded, powerful yet playful. Inspired by little-known Czech artist Libu\u0161e Niklov\u00e1, the pioneer of inflatable children\u2019s toys in the 60s, it was sculptural, sexy and textured. \u201c[Her] bold, graphics and colourful blown-up shapes started our journey in playing with volume and we began cutting our patterns to mimic inflation,\u201d Panszczyk says, hence the \u201cinflated folklore dolls reimagined in sheer organza with regal embellishments that evoke early 60s couture\u201d. The beaded lattice overlays and boots with swinging beads \u2013 inspired by both Polish folk costumes and the mass-market trinket trade in China \u2013 created what the designers like to call \u201ca modern clash of embellishment\u201d. One worth waiting in the rain for. SC</p> <h2><strong>Mary Quant: there\u2019s (still) something about Mary</strong></h2> <p>Mary Quant may as well have been talking about the 2010s when she said, \u201cFashion, as we knew it, is over. People wear now exactly what they feel like wearing.\u201d It makes sense, then, that <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/mary-quant?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIwN26k42s4AIVb7ftCh0flgBDEAAYASAAEgI5OfD_BwE\">London\u2019s V&amp;A is paying tribute</a> to a designer who feels as relevant now as she did in 1966. From 6 April, the museum will host the first international retrospective of the 85-year-old\u2019s work, exploring her career from its experimental beginnings to the designs that made her an icon. With her trademark bob and miniskirt, Quant famously became the figurehead of the youthquake in London, targeting young women with clothes their mothers would have raised an eyebrow at. But that is only entry level. \u201cThe exhibition is long overdue,\u201d says co-curator Jenny Lister. \u201cEveryone thinks of the 60s and miniskirts, but there\u2019s so much more to the story. Almost every designer is influenced by the strength of her brand and how she marketed herself.\u201d</p> <p>Her ability to connect with the public is also enviable: 35 garments were donated by an army of Quant fans who answered a V&amp;A call-out. This exhibition will only add to that fanbase \u2013 and probably increase your desire to wear a miniskirt.

The result \u2013 corsets crossed with bikini tops, dresses and trousers with extreme cutouts and mesh layering \u2013 is \u201cquite menswear in a very womenswear sense\u201d, athletic yet sensual. Drawstrings, semi-sheer fabrics and tortoise graphic patterning were included. \u201cThere are English heritage references, classic prints and checks,\u201d says Knowles, whose nods to the English seaside are \u201ca little bit tongue-in-cheek\u201d. The brand may be in its infancy but it counts Charli XCX and Princess Nokia among its fans. Expect more wearable, and doubtless provocative, looks in their third outing on the Fashion East catwalk for AW19.

Johannes Vermeer\u2019s 1665 Girl With A Pearl Earring. Pearls are everywhere at the moment and it\u2019s thanks in large part to <a href=\"https://wald-berlin.de/\">Wald Berlin</a>. Its sweet-water-pearl-in-a-shell necklace became an Insta hit last year, when it was worn by the most influential of influencers. It was a precursor to this season\u2019s penchant for all things beachcombed. \u201cWe love how you feel by the sea and how it\u2019s associated with freedom and being nomadic,\u201d says designer Dana Roski, who founded the brand in 2018 with Joyce Binneboese. \u201cIt is a very strong childhood memory for both of us \u2013 playing and running around collecting shells \u2013 and we both have a strong connection to nature and the materials nature gives us.\u201d</p> <p>Their SS19 collection, The Bonita \u2013 handmade, like their others, by mothers and grandmothers, including their own \u2013 incorporates dramatic drop shell earrings, as well as bracelets with colourful childlike beads reminiscent of a seaside souvenir. It\u2019s set to be another sellout success at new stockists Net-a-Porter, Harvey Nichols and the Modist, among others. \u201cWe wanted to take some elements of our first collection but give them a more contemporary feel,\u201d Roski says.

Playfulness permeates the unisex brand, backed by ex-Yeezy CEO Cristiano Minchio. Its urban-meets-athleisure aesthetic is, Roth hopes, \u201ceffortless and sexy, gritty and sensual, edgy and classic\u201d. Style mavens? Time to assemble. SC</p> <h2>Paria Farzaneh: the designer making worlds collide</h2> <p>Paria Farzaneh\u2019s parents moved to the UK from Iran more than 30 years ago, and while her roots certainly influence her label, the 24-year-old designer says, \u201cthe story shouldn\u2019t ever be pigeonholed as the same thing every time\u201d. She describes her current \u2013 second \u2013 collection as sitting somewhere between her heritage and the present. This means elegantly tailored khaki streetwear liberally covered in a Ghalamkar, a traditional hand-printed fabric seen in every Iranian\u2019s home, \u201cfrom a bedspread to a tablecloth\u201d. The prints come from a city in Iran called Isfahan, and each pattern is carved by hand from a woodblock.</p> <p>Despite being a woman working exclusively in menswear, Farzaneh thinks designing for gender is a moot point, and \u201ctalking about gender in 2019 is completely irrelevant\u201d. On the radar of the likes of Hypebeast, Dazed &amp; Confused and the LN-CC store, her focus, too, is in flux: \u201cStreetwear is definitely a trend [but] it\u2019s not something with a long shelf life,\u201d she says. \u201cFashion has become very lazy\u2026 we need to smarten up.\u201d Time to dust off the iron.

      "bodyText": "Area NYC: the buzzy brand blowing up this season Generally, when fashion editors are prepared to get wet to watch a show, buzz status is bestowed. This happened on the rainy roof of Seward Park high school on the Lower East Side last September, with New York-based Area, a brand on the radar of style magazines since it was founded in 2016. This collection saw it continue on a journey through pop culture. Set to the sensual melodies of Estonian soul artist Velly Joonas, remixed by the Late Night Tales collective, designers Piotrek Panszczyk and Beckett Fogg captivated the audience with a collection that felt fresh yet grounded, powerful yet playful. Inspired by little-known Czech artist Libu\u0161e Niklov\u00e1, the pioneer of inflatable children\u2019s toys in the 60s, it was sculptural, sexy and textured. \u201c[Her] bold, graphics and colourful blown-up shapes started our journey in playing with volume and we began cutting our patterns to mimic inflation,\u201d Panszczyk says, hence the \u201cinflated folklore dolls reimagined in sheer organza with regal embellishments that evoke early 60s couture\u201d. The beaded lattice overlays and boots with swinging beads \u2013 inspired by both Polish folk costumes and the mass-market trinket trade in China \u2013 created what the designers like to call \u201ca modern clash of embellishment\u201d. One worth waiting in the rain for. SC Mary Quant: there\u2019s (still) something about Mary Mary Quant may as well have been talking about the 2010s when she said, \u201cFashion, as we knew it, is over. People wear now exactly what they feel like wearing.\u201d It makes sense, then, that London\u2019s V&amp;A is paying tribute to a designer who feels as relevant now as she did in 1966. From 6 April, the museum will host the first international retrospective of the 85-year-old\u2019s work, exploring her career from its experimental beginnings to the designs that made her an icon. With her trademark bob and miniskirt, Quant famously became the figurehead of the youthquake in London, targeting young women with clothes their mothers would have raised an eyebrow at. But that is only entry level. \u201cThe exhibition is long overdue,\u201d says co-curator Jenny Lister. \u201cEveryone thinks of the 60s and miniskirts, but there\u2019s so much more to the story. Almost every designer is influenced by the strength of her brand and how she marketed herself.\u201d Her ability to connect with the public is also enviable: 35 garments were donated by an army of Quant fans who answered a V&amp;A call-out. This exhibition will only add to that fanbase \u2013 and probably increase your desire to wear a miniskirt. LH Charlotte Knowles: this is what feminist fashion looks like The Charlotte Knowles brand pulls few punches when it comes to what it\u2019s about: \u201cThe future of femininity, what it embodies now, and the loss of intimacy thanks to social media.\u201d Knowles, 26, and her partner Alexandre Arsenault, 29, launched the label after graduating from Central Saint Martins in 2017. For SS19, they built on their feminine yet deconstructed aesthetic, using Knowles\u2019 family holidays to Salcombe as inspiration. The result \u2013 corsets crossed with bikini tops, dresses and trousers with extreme cutouts and mesh layering \u2013 is \u201cquite menswear in a very womenswear sense\u201d, athletic yet sensual. Drawstrings, semi-sheer fabrics and tortoise graphic patterning were included. \u201cThere are English heritage references, classic prints and checks,\u201d says Knowles, whose nods to the English seaside are \u201ca little bit tongue-in-cheek\u201d. The brand may be in its infancy but it counts Charli XCX and Princess Nokia among its fans. Expect more wearable, and doubtless provocative, looks in their third outing on the Fashion East catwalk for AW19. LH Wald Berlin: the label making pearls happen The artwork on the moodboard of jewellery designers in 2019? Johannes Vermeer\u2019s 1665 Girl With A Pearl Earring. Pearls are everywhere at the moment and it\u2019s thanks in large part to Wald Berlin. Its sweet-water-pearl-in-a-shell necklace became an Insta hit last year, when it was worn by the most influential of influencers. It was a precursor to this season\u2019s penchant for all things beachcombed. \u201cWe love how you feel by the sea and how it\u2019s associated with freedom and being nomadic,\u201d says designer Dana Roski, who founded the brand in 2018 with Joyce Binneboese. \u201cIt is a very strong childhood memory for both of us \u2013 playing and running around collecting shells \u2013 and we both have a strong connection to nature and the materials nature gives us.\u201d Their SS19 collection, The Bonita \u2013 handmade, like their others, by mothers and grandmothers, including their own \u2013 incorporates dramatic drop shell earrings, as well as bracelets with colourful childlike beads reminiscent of a seaside souvenir. It\u2019s set to be another sellout success at new stockists Net-a-Porter, Harvey Nichols and the Modist, among others. \u201cWe wanted to take some elements of our first collection but give them a more contemporary feel,\u201d Roski says. SC Artica Arbox: the unisex brand that wants us all to be heroes If Artica Arbox sounds like Marvel\u2019s next release, that\u2019s because the new brand, by former movie marketing guru Irene Roth, is called after the aliases her sons used when playing superhero games. Playfulness permeates the unisex brand, backed by ex-Yeezy CEO Cristiano Minchio. Its urban-meets-athleisure aesthetic is, Roth hopes, \u201ceffortless and sexy, gritty and sensual, edgy and classic\u201d. Style mavens? Time to assemble. SC Paria Farzaneh: the designer making worlds collide Paria Farzaneh\u2019s parents moved to the UK from Iran more than 30 years ago, and while her roots certainly influence her label, the 24-year-old designer says, \u201cthe story shouldn\u2019t ever be pigeonholed as the same thing every time\u201d. She describes her current \u2013 second \u2013 collection as sitting somewhere between her heritage and the present. This means elegantly tailored khaki streetwear liberally covered in a Ghalamkar, a traditional hand-printed fabric seen in every Iranian\u2019s home, \u201cfrom a bedspread to a tablecloth\u201d. The prints come from a city in Iran called Isfahan, and each pattern is carved by hand from a woodblock. Despite being a woman working exclusively in menswear, Farzaneh thinks designing for gender is a moot point, and \u201ctalking about gender in 2019 is completely irrelevant\u201d. On the radar of the likes of Hypebeast, Dazed &amp; Confused and the LN-CC store, her focus, too, is in flux: \u201cStreetwear is definitely a trend [but] it\u2019s not something with a long shelf life,\u201d she says. \u201cFashion has become very lazy\u2026 we need to smarten up.\u201d Time to dust off the iron. MF Parley for the Oceans: the organisation making ocean plastic into fashion \u201cPurpose is the new luxury,\u201d Parley for the Oceans founder Cyrill Gutsch declared at December\u2019s Fashion Awards as he lifted the gong for innovation. The creator of recycled Ocean Plastic \u2013 used in tote bags designed by artist and long-time collaborator Julian Schnabel and by Stella McCartney for Adidas \u2013 says that the industry \u201chas the power to create change fast\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Poppy was travelling the world when it began. It started in Malaysia and got worse in Australia. The student had the infection for a few weeks before she saw a doctor and was given a quick hit of broad-spectrum antibiotics. They didn\u2019t work.</p> <p>\u201cI went on getting worse,\u201d she says. \u201cI was not in any city long enough to do a full culture and wait for the right antibiotics.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, after a month, she was given treatment that helped, but it was a temporary respite. Fifteen years later, Poppy (not her real name) is still often in pain. The infection was an attack of cystitis, a common acute urinary tract infection (UTI). Back in the UK, her condition became chronic. \u201cI got stuck in a cycle of infection.\u201d</p> <p>Most people \u2013 and most doctors \u2013 think of UTIs as nasty but short-lived. It is unclear how they are contracted, but according to the NHS \u201cmost cases are thought to occur when bacteria that live harmlessly in the bowel or on the skin get into the bladder through the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of your body)\u201d. The standard test is for bacteria in a urine sample. The standard treatment is three to five days of antibiotics. A one-off acute attack can be cleared very quickly. But there are thousands of women whose experience is very different. They cannot get well. They have chronic infection that dominates their lives. They spend months and years in and out of GP practices and hospitals, having tests and treatments that sometimes exacerbate the problem. And to make it so much worse, they feel they are not taken seriously.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7bf8b258097611cd6631b17cb1a0503204df1551\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bf8b258097611cd6631b17cb1a0503204df1551/110_316_2482_3103/800.jpg\" alt=\"Prof James Malone-Lee.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof James Malone-Lee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOne male consultant said maybe I was washing too zealously. Male GPs asked why I was crying. I\u2019m crying because I\u2019m in pain and I\u2019m scared and no one seems to know what\u2019s wrong,\u201d says Poppy.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how we can do heart transplants and land on the moon and not kill the bacteria in my bladder.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a scandal,\u201d agrees Jade Henderson, 27, who lives in Durham and experienced a number of acute UTIs before hers became chronic in February 2017. \u201cI was hardly leaving the house because I was constantly feeling I needed the toilet. Some women have really bad pain. Mine was more of a constant discomfort where I couldn\u2019t put my mind to anything apart from feeling I needed to go to the toilet.\u201d</p> <p>She was unable to work, suffering stress and anxiety. \u201cI was in a long-term relationship at the time. A guy I\u2019d been with for five years. It had an impact on my sex life and that relationship broke down. There were other factors. But that probably played a part.</p> <p>\u201cThe mental effect was awful because I was constantly going to the doctor\u2019s and my GP was none the wiser. I was getting urine samples sent away that were coming back normal. I saw urologists in the NHS who rolled their eyes and told me there was nothing wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Like many others, she searched for help online because GPs and urologists diagnose conditions that seem to be labels for an unfixable problem \u2013 painful bladder syndrome or interstitial cystitis. There is no offer of a cure. Many of these women \u2013 and it is usually women although not solely \u2013 converse in Facebook support groups and talk of a clinic at the Whittington hospital in north London and a consultant \u2013 Prof James Malone-Lee, who has pioneered a different approach.</p> <p>Malone-Lee recently retired from the NHS, but his research, his private practice and the handful of doctors who have adopted his thinking, continue the work. The gold-standard UTI test, used since the 1950s, is no good for a chronic UTI, he says, because it does not detect bacteria hidden in the bladder\u2019s lining. <a href=\"https://jcm.asm.org/content/early/2018/12/10/JCM.01452-18\" title=\"\">In a recent study</a>, Dr Jennifer Rohn, principal investigator of the chronic UTI group at the Royal Free hospital and University College London, found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/12/researchers-call-for-new-uti-urinary-tract-infections-testing-method\" title=\"\">the test \u201cfailed spectacularly\u201d</a> when compared with DNA analysis, which picked up infections the standard test missed every time.</p> <p>Malone-Lee put it even more strongly. \u201cFor decades, patients suffering appalling symptoms have been betrayed by a urine test that isn\u2019t fit for purpose,\u201d he said in December.</p> <p>Some in the medical establishment are anxious about his treatment, because he gives women months or even years of antibiotics. But <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00192-018-3569-7\" title=\"\">a published review of outcomes for 624 women treated over 10 years</a> at the Luts (lower urinary tract symptoms) clinic at Hornsey central health centre showed that they got better, just one had a serious side-effect and that there were no instances of antimicrobial resistance. That one case of a serious side-effect resulted in the clinic being closed down for some months. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/30564872/?i=1&amp;from=swamy%20malone-lee\" title=\"\">A research paper</a> subsequently found the other patients got worse during the closure.</p> <p>Henderson is typical of the women treated at the clinic. \u201cUntil I found the professor, I just felt alone and wondered would I ever get better? Would I ever get back to a normal life?\u201d she says.</p> <p>What does she mean when she calls it a scandal? \u201cThe tests that the NHS use as gold standard miss 50% of infections,\u201d she says. \u201cThe fact that this condition\u2019s not recognised by the NHS, not really. It is so very, very common.\u201d People with chronic UTIs become expert patients. More expert, they believe, than their doctors.</p> <p>She knows of many fellow sufferers through her Facebook group, but happens across them in her everyday life, too, which makes her think it is far more usual than people realise. \u201cI was dating a guy and told him about the problems I\u2019d had with my bladder and he said he\u2019d got a female friend who had been off work for about nine months with her bladder. She was really poorly, on morphine. Anyway, he put me in touch with her and she ended up going to see the professor. This was about seven months ago. She\u2019s getting a lot better. She had ulcers in her bladder \u2013 but the antibiotics seem to be working a treat.</p> <p>\u201cThere are clearly so many women out there and even specialist urologists have no knowledge of it at all. It\u2019s trying to change beliefs that have been instilled into doctors for so many years.\u201d</p> <p>She likens Malone-Lee to \u201ca one-man band trying to educate all these urologists and GPs. It\u2019s going to take time. Many women are being fobbed off.\u201d</p> <p>UTIs are commonly thought to be an affliction of mostly elderly people. But there are many young women who suffer chronic infection \u2013 and even children.</p> <p>Alice was just three years old when she developed a UTI, possibly from a swimming pool, says her mother, Alison Taylor, who lives in Oxford. \u201cWe went to the GP. She was given a course of antibiotics and it did clear the infection, but, 36 hours later, the symptoms were back with a vengeance.\u201d</p> <p>Alice had pain in her lower abdomen. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t able to sleep. She was running every five minutes to the loo,\u201d says her mother. It was distressing. \u201cWhen they are tiny, you feel very responsible for them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8a2cfcd20c5f45bbb62f7c7a1683624452362dd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a2cfcd20c5f45bbb62f7c7a1683624452362dd5/0_93_1200_1500/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jade Henderson.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jade Henderson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jade Henderson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They kept going to the GP. Urine tests came back negative. \u201cIt was heartbreaking. I was desperately hoping the cultures would show something and she could be prescribed antibiotics and it would all go away,\u201d says Taylor. But they showed \u201cmixed growth\u201d or \u201cinsufficient growth\u201d, which were classified as negative results.</p> <p>One time, when Alice was distressed, her mother called the NHS\u2019s 111 medical helpline. \u201cThe call handler told me it was just the symptoms of a urinary tract infection and the GP would prescribe a course of antibiotics and everything would be all right. I just felt sick because I knew that was not the case.\u201d</p> <p>They were referred to hospital, where scans and more tests all came back negative. \u201cWe spoke to one consultant who said: \u2018We think she has painful bladder syndrome. Even presented with all the classic symptoms of an infection, we were being told she doesn\u2019t have an infection. It was so worrying and so frustrating,\u201d Taylor says.</p> <p>\u201cThe paediatric urologists were \u201clovely\u201d and \u201cwonderful\u201d, but fixed in their assumptions. \u201cThey put so much false faith in the tests. It was like talking to a brick wall.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just a terrible time,\u201d continues Taylor. \u201cI felt so vulnerable and incredibly worried.\u201d</p> <p>She found references online to D-mannose powder, which small studies have suggested may help prevent infection. \u201cIt was just a simple sugar. I thought it was worth trying. We didn\u2019t have anything to lose,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Meanwhile, she had found a GP who specialised in chronic UTIs, who sent Alice\u2019s urine to a private lab where it was cultured longer and was found to have an E-coli infection. Taylor was reluctant to have her daughter on a long course of antibiotics and the D-mannose seemed to be working, so they decided to wait. Alice was fine for three years. When the symptoms returned, and various short-course antibiotics didn\u2019t work, she was referred to Malone-Lee.</p> <p>Alice, now six, was missing school, says Taylor. \u201cIt impacts on every area of a child\u2019s life. She was incredibly anxious and depressed. When her symptoms were really bad she said to me: \u2018Mummy, I don\u2019t want to live like this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Malone-Lee saw her within days and started her on long-term antibiotics, warning that it would take time, but after nine months of treatment, she has made a full recovery. \u201cHer quality of life is back. She is a totally different individual,\u201d says Taylor, who now helps support other parents. Through this involvment, she says she has heard of children being prescribed morphine to control the pain. \u201cWhat is happening is appalling,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Malone-Lee says that by the time patients arrive at his clinic they have, on average, been suffering from a chronic UTI for six-and-a-half years. \u201cMy experience in seeing new patients is always the same. There\u2019s a kind of panic inside me to get this right because it\u2019s had such a terrible toll on them,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re in pain all the time, they can\u2019t have sex, their personal relationships are an awful mess, they\u2019re so unwell many of them can\u2019t work, go on holiday, socialise ... They know there\u2019s something wrong, but keep being told there\u2019s not. It\u2019s frankly a nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>He says the flaws in current methods for diagnosis date back to some of the earliest research on UTIs in the 1950s. It was thought, incorrectly, that the normal human bladder is completely sterile. So if bacteria grew in a cultured urine sample it was thought to signal an underlying infection.

      "bodyText": "Poppy was travelling the world when it began. It started in Malaysia and got worse in Australia. The student had the infection for a few weeks before she saw a doctor and was given a quick hit of broad-spectrum antibiotics. They didn\u2019t work. \u201cI went on getting worse,\u201d she says. \u201cI was not in any city long enough to do a full culture and wait for the right antibiotics.\u201d Finally, after a month, she was given treatment that helped, but it was a temporary respite. Fifteen years later, Poppy (not her real name) is still often in pain. The infection was an attack of cystitis, a common acute urinary tract infection (UTI). Back in the UK, her condition became chronic. \u201cI got stuck in a cycle of infection.\u201d Most people \u2013 and most doctors \u2013 think of UTIs as nasty but short-lived. It is unclear how they are contracted, but according to the NHS \u201cmost cases are thought to occur when bacteria that live harmlessly in the bowel or on the skin get into the bladder through the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of your body)\u201d. The standard test is for bacteria in a urine sample. The standard treatment is three to five days of antibiotics. A one-off acute attack can be cleared very quickly. But there are thousands of women whose experience is very different. They cannot get well. They have chronic infection that dominates their lives. They spend months and years in and out of GP practices and hospitals, having tests and treatments that sometimes exacerbate the problem. And to make it so much worse, they feel they are not taken seriously. \u201cOne male consultant said maybe I was washing too zealously. Male GPs asked why I was crying. I\u2019m crying because I\u2019m in pain and I\u2019m scared and no one seems to know what\u2019s wrong,\u201d says Poppy. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how we can do heart transplants and land on the moon and not kill the bacteria in my bladder.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a scandal,\u201d agrees Jade Henderson, 27, who lives in Durham and experienced a number of acute UTIs before hers became chronic in February 2017. \u201cI was hardly leaving the house because I was constantly feeling I needed the toilet. Some women have really bad pain. Mine was more of a constant discomfort where I couldn\u2019t put my mind to anything apart from feeling I needed to go to the toilet.\u201d She was unable to work, suffering stress and anxiety. \u201cI was in a long-term relationship at the time. A guy I\u2019d been with for five years. It had an impact on my sex life and that relationship broke down. There were other factors. But that probably played a part. \u201cThe mental effect was awful because I was constantly going to the doctor\u2019s and my GP was none the wiser. I was getting urine samples sent away that were coming back normal. I saw urologists in the NHS who rolled their eyes and told me there was nothing wrong.\u201d Like many others, she searched for help online because GPs and urologists diagnose conditions that seem to be labels for an unfixable problem \u2013 painful bladder syndrome or interstitial cystitis. There is no offer of a cure. Many of these women \u2013 and it is usually women although not solely \u2013 converse in Facebook support groups and talk of a clinic at the Whittington hospital in north London and a consultant \u2013 Prof James Malone-Lee, who has pioneered a different approach. Malone-Lee recently retired from the NHS, but his research, his private practice and the handful of doctors who have adopted his thinking, continue the work. The gold-standard UTI test, used since the 1950s, is no good for a chronic UTI, he says, because it does not detect bacteria hidden in the bladder\u2019s lining. In a recent study, Dr Jennifer Rohn, principal investigator of the chronic UTI group at the Royal Free hospital and University College London, found that the test \u201cfailed spectacularly\u201d when compared with DNA analysis, which picked up infections the standard test missed every time. Malone-Lee put it even more strongly. \u201cFor decades, patients suffering appalling symptoms have been betrayed by a urine test that isn\u2019t fit for purpose,\u201d he said in December. Some in the medical establishment are anxious about his treatment, because he gives women months or even years of antibiotics. But a published review of outcomes for 624 women treated over 10 years at the Luts (lower urinary tract symptoms) clinic at Hornsey central health centre showed that they got better, just one had a serious side-effect and that there were no instances of antimicrobial resistance. That one case of a serious side-effect resulted in the clinic being closed down for some months. A research paper subsequently found the other patients got worse during the closure. Henderson is typical of the women treated at the clinic. \u201cUntil I found the professor, I just felt alone and wondered would I ever get better? Would I ever get back to a normal life?\u201d she says. What does she mean when she calls it a scandal? \u201cThe tests that the NHS use as gold standard miss 50% of infections,\u201d she says. \u201cThe fact that this condition\u2019s not recognised by the NHS, not really. It is so very, very common.\u201d People with chronic UTIs become expert patients. More expert, they believe, than their doctors. She knows of many fellow sufferers through her Facebook group, but happens across them in her everyday life, too, which makes her think it is far more usual than people realise. \u201cI was dating a guy and told him about the problems I\u2019d had with my bladder and he said he\u2019d got a female friend who had been off work for about nine months with her bladder. She was really poorly, on morphine. Anyway, he put me in touch with her and she ended up going to see the professor. This was about seven months ago. She\u2019s getting a lot better. She had ulcers in her bladder \u2013 but the antibiotics seem to be working a treat. \u201cThere are clearly so many women out there and even specialist urologists have no knowledge of it at all. It\u2019s trying to change beliefs that have been instilled into doctors for so many years.\u201d She likens Malone-Lee to \u201ca one-man band trying to educate all these urologists and GPs. It\u2019s going to take time. Many women are being fobbed off.\u201d UTIs are commonly thought to be an affliction of mostly elderly people. But there are many young women who suffer chronic infection \u2013 and even children. Alice was just three years old when she developed a UTI, possibly from a swimming pool, says her mother, Alison Taylor, who lives in Oxford. \u201cWe went to the GP. She was given a course of antibiotics and it did clear the infection, but, 36 hours later, the symptoms were back with a vengeance.\u201d Alice had pain in her lower abdomen. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t able to sleep. She was running every five minutes to the loo,\u201d says her mother. It was distressing. \u201cWhen they are tiny, you feel very responsible for them.\u201d They kept going to the GP. Urine tests came back negative. \u201cIt was heartbreaking. I was desperately hoping the cultures would show something and she could be prescribed antibiotics and it would all go away,\u201d says Taylor. But they showed \u201cmixed growth\u201d or \u201cinsufficient growth\u201d, which were classified as negative results. One time, when Alice was distressed, her mother called the NHS\u2019s 111 medical helpline. \u201cThe call handler told me it was just the symptoms of a urinary tract infection and the GP would prescribe a course of antibiotics and everything would be all right. I just felt sick because I knew that was not the case.\u201d They were referred to hospital, where scans and more tests all came back negative. \u201cWe spoke to one consultant who said: \u2018We think she has painful bladder syndrome. Even presented with all the classic symptoms of an infection, we were being told she doesn\u2019t have an infection. It was so worrying and so frustrating,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cThe paediatric urologists were \u201clovely\u201d and \u201cwonderful\u201d, but fixed in their assumptions. \u201cThey put so much false faith in the tests. It was like talking to a brick wall. \u201cIt was just a terrible time,\u201d continues Taylor. \u201cI felt so vulnerable and incredibly worried.\u201d She found references online to D-mannose powder, which small studies have suggested may help prevent infection. \u201cIt was just a simple sugar. I thought it was worth trying. We didn\u2019t have anything to lose,\u201d she says. Meanwhile, she had found a GP who specialised in chronic UTIs, who sent Alice\u2019s urine to a private lab where it was cultured longer and was found to have an E-coli infection. Taylor was reluctant to have her daughter on a long course of antibiotics and the D-mannose seemed to be working, so they decided to wait. Alice was fine for three years. When the symptoms returned, and various short-course antibiotics didn\u2019t work, she was referred to Malone-Lee. Alice, now six, was missing school, says Taylor. \u201cIt impacts on every area of a child\u2019s life. She was incredibly anxious and depressed. When her symptoms were really bad she said to me: \u2018Mummy, I don\u2019t want to live like this.\u2019\u201d Malone-Lee saw her within days and started her on long-term antibiotics, warning that it would take time, but after nine months of treatment, she has made a full recovery. \u201cHer quality of life is back. She is a totally different individual,\u201d says Taylor, who now helps support other parents. Through this involvment, she says she has heard of children being prescribed morphine to control the pain. \u201cWhat is happening is appalling,\u201d she says. Malone-Lee says that by the time patients arrive at his clinic they have, on average, been suffering from a chronic UTI for six-and-a-half years. \u201cMy experience in seeing new patients is always the same. There\u2019s a kind of panic inside me to get this right because it\u2019s had such a terrible toll on them,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re in pain all the time, they can\u2019t have sex, their personal relationships are an awful mess, they\u2019re so unwell many of them can\u2019t work, go on holiday, socialise ... They know there\u2019s something wrong, but keep being told there\u2019s not. It\u2019s frankly a nightmare.\u201d He says the flaws in current methods for diagnosis date back to some of the earliest research on UTIs in the 1950s. It was thought, incorrectly, that the normal human bladder is completely sterile. So if bacteria grew in a cultured urine sample it was thought to signal an underlying infection. In an early paper, an arbitrary threshold was put forward as being indicative of a true infection rather than contamination. And despite this threshold never having been properly validated, it gradually became accepted. For any given patient, it is difficult to pinpoint which particular microbe is causing the problem \u2013 it may even be interactions between several. Nevertheless, Malone-Lee and his team have been investigating possible candidates and what they discovered could help explain why UTIs can be so hard to treat. When they grew one bacterial species, called Enterococcus, in culture along with bladder cells, it displayed a range of alarming tactics to evade treatment. The bugs were sometimes seen to burrow into cells and form \u201cnests\u201d on the interior. They would then go into hibernation, sometimes for months at a time, during which time they would be invulnerable to attack by antibiotics. At other times, bacterial colonies morphed into biofilms that glued themselves to the outside of cells and, again, entered a temporarily dormant state. The findings explained why short courses of treatment can be ineffective: while bugs that are floating free in the bladder are killed off, a reservoir might remain inside cells or on the surface of the bladder wall. As cells in the bladder wall are shed during the course of a natural life cycle, the dormant bacteria is released, re-activating the infection. The bladder wall completely regenerates over a period of about nine months. And some patients, Malone-Lee argues, will only be rid of their infection by treating them for at least this long. Instead of relying on culture tests, Malone-Lee\u2019s lab developed a treatment regime informed by the patients\u2019 symptoms and also the presence of white blood cells in the urine, which are normally indicative of an infection. Typically patients are treated with antibiotics until the symptoms are gone and the white-blood-cell count returns to normal. They are then monitored to see if signs of an infection reappear. If they do, they are put back on the antibiotics. The average time for patients at the clinic to completely come off drugs is about a year. Some very senior clinicians support Malone-Lee\u2019s work. Mark Slack, head of gynaecology at Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge, regularly sees patients debilitated by chronic UTIs, describing the condition as a \u201cmajor problem\u201d. \u201cIn 20 years we haven\u2019t advanced one inch from where we were,\u201d he says. He is critical of those who dismiss patients\u2019 problems as being primarily psychological \u2013 instead saying having a UTI for long enough can impact a person\u2019s psychological well being. He says he has had patients who have been completely well, then get what seems to be a UTI and become virtually disabled. Nikesh Thiruchelvam, a consultant urologist also at Addenbrooke\u2019s, has sent some of his patients to Malone-Lee.\u201cThere are much more expensive but higher quality techniques for urine cultures that are not used in clinical practice,\u201d he says, describing the usual tests as \u201coutdated\u201d. Malone-Lee\u2019s published data \u201cshows quite good results\u201d says Thiruchelvam. But it is retrospective and not a randomised trial. There is also the difficult issue of long-term antibiotics at a time when the NHS is trying to use these vital drugs less to preserve their power against bacterial resistance. Yet there is a way forward: a clinical trial. He thinks the National Institute for Health Research, part of the NHS, should commission one \u2013 and the patient groups should push for it to happen. Cutic, the chronic urinary tract infection campaign, run by patients and families, is calling for better testing and treatment for the half a million people in Britain it estimates are suffering from chronic UTIs. They say the 10-year study on the efficacy of long-term antibiotics for the treatment of chronic Luts was \u201cvery persuasive\u201d. Alison Taylor is one of those who believes the evidence is already clear. \u201cThe international research is supportive of Malone-Lee\u2019s findings,\u201d she says. \u201cHe is not a lone voice at all.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In 1975, photographer Michel Comte stood up before scientists, business leaders and politicians at the Club of Rome to deliver a speech about the climate disaster he believed was on the horizon. Back then, he was still a student, and a little nervous \u2013 but he could sense the future. Now, Comte\u2019s recent works incorporating black carbon fallout from the jet stream, shown in Rome, Milan and Hong Kong, prove just how right he was to speak out.</p> <p>Comte\u2019s message was echoed last week in the UK, when thousands of schoolchildren \u2013 inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/25/our-house-is-on-fire-greta-thunberg16-urges-leaders-to-act-on-climate\">16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg</a> \u2013 took to the streets to pressure the government into taking action on climate change. Like Comte, they have seen a bleak future ahead and are speaking out.</p> <p>Sadly, that hasn\u2019t been the case for most artistic and cultural institutions, which have spent the last few decades responding to climate change with little more than silence. They have been dangerously complicit in desensitising society to what\u2019s really at stake.</p> <p>It hasn\u2019t always been this way. In the mid-90s, when a post-Chernobyl generation made its voice heard, the ecological protest movement was nurtured by critical theatre, radical art shows, public debate and avant garde music. Then something changed. In response to the backlash against fossil fuels, major energy suppliers became involved with arts sponsorship. This was no harmless philanthropy. Parallel to the rise of the blockbuster exhibition the importance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/19/shells-ends-national-gallery-sponsorship-to-delight-of-campaigners\">Shell</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jan/26/tate-reveal-bp-sponsorship-150000-330000-platform-information-tribunal\">BP</a> to the artistic budget of arts centres grew, to a point where many major national institutions were on the payroll of the fossil fuel giants. Some still are today.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For decades arts institutions have effectively engaged in self-censorship, denying us a debate on fossil fuels</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But even for those who have freed themselves of it (or exchanged them for carmakers), the damage to a generation has been done. For decades arts institutions have effectively engaged in self-censorship to pay for their productions, putting on amazing programming and covering critical topics, as long as it wasn\u2019t a thorough debate of our addiction to fossil fuels. This strategic exclusion of a topic from public debate over more than a generation has led to ignorance, with repercussions in education, academic and public life.</p> <p>But there is hope in the air. Tate Modern have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/31/olafur-eliasson-your-blind-passenger-tunnel-fog-tate-modern-installation\">an Olafur Eliasson retrospective scheduled for this summer</a> \u2013 his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/dec/11/icebergs-ahead-olafur-eliasson-brings-the-frozen-fjord-to-britain-ice-watch-london-climate-change\">Ice Watch project</a> was recently invited to melt away outside the museum, with the carbon impact of each block accounted for. As for Comte, he is about to board a sailing boat for a challenging passage to the Arctic, creating a monumental light installation calling for us to change our ways before it\u2019s too late. If we allow more artists such as these to become part of the conversation, we will have a culture fit for the generation of children who took to our streets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ac9a5d32e6f9bf9425e9e3741b3e986e968d0b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ac9a5d32e6f9bf9425e9e3741b3e986e968d0b5/0_0_4912_2760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"detail from Lagoon by Yi Dai.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Subtle response to catastrophe \u2026 detail of Lagoon by Yi Dai.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy House of Egorn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Nuclear fallout, rising sea levels and \u2026 nail clippings<br></strong>When artist Yi Dai opened her first solo show in Berlin, she received rapturous reviews praising her subtle and intelligent coverage of environmental topics.<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.houseofegorn.com/\">Misfits, Offcuts and Castaways</a>, in 2016, was an urgent statement reflecting on the aftereffects of nuclear fallout and rising sea temperatures, and the fragility of our ecosystem.

      "bodyText": "In 1975, photographer Michel Comte stood up before scientists, business leaders and politicians at the Club of Rome to deliver a speech about the climate disaster he believed was on the horizon. Back then, he was still a student, and a little nervous \u2013 but he could sense the future. Now, Comte\u2019s recent works incorporating black carbon fallout from the jet stream, shown in Rome, Milan and Hong Kong, prove just how right he was to speak out. Comte\u2019s message was echoed last week in the UK, when thousands of schoolchildren \u2013 inspired by 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg \u2013 took to the streets to pressure the government into taking action on climate change. Like Comte, they have seen a bleak future ahead and are speaking out. Sadly, that hasn\u2019t been the case for most artistic and cultural institutions, which have spent the last few decades responding to climate change with little more than silence. They have been dangerously complicit in desensitising society to what\u2019s really at stake. It hasn\u2019t always been this way. In the mid-90s, when a post-Chernobyl generation made its voice heard, the ecological protest movement was nurtured by critical theatre, radical art shows, public debate and avant garde music. Then something changed. In response to the backlash against fossil fuels, major energy suppliers became involved with arts sponsorship. This was no harmless philanthropy. Parallel to the rise of the blockbuster exhibition the importance of Shell and BP to the artistic budget of arts centres grew, to a point where many major national institutions were on the payroll of the fossil fuel giants. Some still are today. But even for those who have freed themselves of it (or exchanged them for carmakers), the damage to a generation has been done. For decades arts institutions have effectively engaged in self-censorship to pay for their productions, putting on amazing programming and covering critical topics, as long as it wasn\u2019t a thorough debate of our addiction to fossil fuels. This strategic exclusion of a topic from public debate over more than a generation has led to ignorance, with repercussions in education, academic and public life. But there is hope in the air. Tate Modern have an Olafur Eliasson retrospective scheduled for this summer \u2013 his Ice Watch project was recently invited to melt away outside the museum, with the carbon impact of each block accounted for. As for Comte, he is about to board a sailing boat for a challenging passage to the Arctic, creating a monumental light installation calling for us to change our ways before it\u2019s too late. If we allow more artists such as these to become part of the conversation, we will have a culture fit for the generation of children who took to our streets. Nuclear fallout, rising sea levels and \u2026 nail clippings When artist Yi Dai opened her first solo show in Berlin, she received rapturous reviews praising her subtle and intelligent coverage of environmental topics. Misfits, Offcuts and Castaways, in 2016, was an urgent statement reflecting on the aftereffects of nuclear fallout and rising sea temperatures, and the fragility of our ecosystem. Her exhibition was as much a personal account of her experience on the Marshall Islands as it was a call to action following the then-warmest winter in recorded history. Her show, Discarded\u2026 During My 20s (at House of Egorn in Berlin until 23 February), explores the subject of the human body: the artist juxtaposes bodily remains \u2013 hair, nail clippings, blood \u2013 with construction materials such as steel, concrete and glass that surround, contain, or reflect our bodies. Sailing to the Arctic for a climate vigil Wavelength Foundation was formed on a sailing boat in late 2017 by an international group of journalists, writers, environmentalists, cultural workers, artists and scientists. One of the foundation\u2019s fundamental principles is that a rich and meaningful cultural engagement with nature is needed to readjust their lost relationship. Comte will soon set sail to the Arctic with the foundation for his large-scale 3D-mapping light installation Black Light, inviting sailors from around the globe to join his monumental climate vigil. Meanwhile, the foundation\u2019s Change Maker scheme is helping to build a sustainable arts and culture centre in South America, to bring the opportunities of a circular economy to the lives of children and younger people looking to escape the cycle of poverty.

It is also that the impacts on the young people themselves, if their mobilisation and hopes collapse so early in their lives, could be devastating.</p> \n<p>To help this movement win, we should ask why others lost. We should ask, for instance, why Occupy, despite the energy and sacrifices of so many, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/occupy-wall-street-reunites-five-years-later-it-never-ended-for-most-of-us\" title=\"\">came to an end</a>, while the institutions it confronted remain intact.

We should consider why Podemos, the Spanish party that rose so high on the optimism of the indignados movement, now seems to be spiralling into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/19/podemos-spanish-politics\" title=\"\">recriminatory collapse</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Much of what I propose here is controversial, and I can't promise I've got it right</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Those of us who witnessed these disappointments have, I feel, a painful duty to be as honest about them as possible, to help ensure their failures are not repeated. Much of what I propose here is controversial, and I can\u2019t promise I\u2019ve got it right. So my first advice is this: don\u2019t listen only to me.</p> \n<p>A central task for any campaign is to develop a narrative: a short, simple story explaining where we are, how we got here and where we need to go. Using the narrative structure common to almost all successful political and religious transformations, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/09/george-monbiot-how-de-we-get-out-of-this-mess\" title=\"\">restoration story</a>, it might go something like this. \u201cThe world has been thrown into climate chaos, caused by fossil fuel companies, the billionaires who profit from them and the politicians they have bought. But we, the young heroes, will confront these oligarchs, using our moral authority to create a movement so big and politically dangerous that our governments are forced to shut down the fossil economy and restore the benign conditions in which humans and other species can thrive.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/19/i-cant-wait-for-the-striking-schoolchildren-to-grab-the-reins-of-power\">I can\u2019t wait for the striking schoolchildren to grab the reins of power | Suzanne Moore</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This restoration narrative, I think, could be greatly strengthened by <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/114/44/11645\" title=\"\">recent findings</a> suggesting that ecological recovery \u2013 restoring forests, salt marshes, peat bogs, the seabed and other crucial ecosystems \u2013 could, by drawing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, make a massive contribution towards preventing climate breakdown. (I\u2019ll write about that when I finish my research on the subject, in a few weeks). A successful movement should also define a clear and tangible objective, perhaps a date by which nations achieve a <a href=\"https://www.cat.org.uk/info-resources/zero-carbon-britain/\" title=\"\">zero-carbon economy</a>. It could recommend a pathway, such as a ramped-up version of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/11/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ed-markey\" title=\"\">green new deal</a> proposed by the most progressive Democrats. If so, it will need to set a series of waymarks, by which it can judge whether or not governments are on track. This ensures that the activists, rather than the government, keep setting the agenda.</p> \n<p>This objective should be supported by a set of irreducible principles that can be explained and spread with pride and conviction. Here are a couple of possible examples. \u201cHuman life is not negotiable, it cannot be exchanged for money.\u201d \u201cThose generations that are yet to be born have the same rights as those already alive.\u201d</p> \n<p>Clear principles appear to be essential to the long-running success of a campaign. A <a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/campaign-to-defend-mexicos-sacred-lake-changes-global-activism/\" title=\"\">fascinating report</a> in the online magazine Truthout explains how indigenous people living around Lake Texcoco in Mexico confronted a $13bn international airport \u2013 one of the biggest infrastructure projects in Latin America \u2013 and, across 17 years, and despite all predictions, won. The campaign was built on the principle that their land and community were not for sale, however much money might be offered. This ensured that the Mexican government\u2019s only remaining strategy was force. But the people had created such strong community organisations and attracted so much support from other Mexicans that force ceased to be an option.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2f73ba48-765e-4771-8b4f-221c71d3ab0e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cMZwTawkqYg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This suggests another crucial element: a protest community strong enough to resist all attempts at division and co-option. Such communities do not arise by accident but are consciously and carefully constructed, often with the help of training, music and fun. They must be strong enough to support people threatened by despair, burnout or breakdown, especially when the response gets nasty.

      "bodyText": "This one has to succeed. It is not just that the youth climate strike, now building worldwide with tremendous speed, is our best (and possibly our last) hope of avoiding catastrophe. It is also that the impacts on the young people themselves, if their mobilisation and hopes collapse so early in their lives, could be devastating. To help this movement win, we should ask why others lost. We should ask, for instance, why Occupy, despite the energy and sacrifices of so many, came to an end, while the institutions it confronted remain intact. We should wonder why the global justice movement of the late 1990s and early 2000s, despite the numbers involved, their courage and determination, has not changed the world. We should consider why Podemos, the Spanish party that rose so high on the optimism of the indignados movement, now seems to be spiralling into recriminatory collapse. Those of us who witnessed these disappointments have, I feel, a painful duty to be as honest about them as possible, to help ensure their failures are not repeated. Much of what I propose here is controversial, and I can\u2019t promise I\u2019ve got it right. So my first advice is this: don\u2019t listen only to me. A central task for any campaign is to develop a narrative: a short, simple story explaining where we are, how we got here and where we need to go. Using the narrative structure common to almost all successful political and religious transformations, the restoration story, it might go something like this. \u201cThe world has been thrown into climate chaos, caused by fossil fuel companies, the billionaires who profit from them and the politicians they have bought. But we, the young heroes, will confront these oligarchs, using our moral authority to create a movement so big and politically dangerous that our governments are forced to shut down the fossil economy and restore the benign conditions in which humans and other species can thrive.\u201d This restoration narrative, I think, could be greatly strengthened by recent findings suggesting that ecological recovery \u2013 restoring forests, salt marshes, peat bogs, the seabed and other crucial ecosystems \u2013 could, by drawing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, make a massive contribution towards preventing climate breakdown. (I\u2019ll write about that when I finish my research on the subject, in a few weeks). A successful movement should also define a clear and tangible objective, perhaps a date by which nations achieve a zero-carbon economy. It could recommend a pathway, such as a ramped-up version of the green new deal proposed by the most progressive Democrats. If so, it will need to set a series of waymarks, by which it can judge whether or not governments are on track. This ensures that the activists, rather than the government, keep setting the agenda. This objective should be supported by a set of irreducible principles that can be explained and spread with pride and conviction. Here are a couple of possible examples. \u201cHuman life is not negotiable, it cannot be exchanged for money.\u201d \u201cThose generations that are yet to be born have the same rights as those already alive.\u201d Clear principles appear to be essential to the long-running success of a campaign. A fascinating report in the online magazine Truthout explains how indigenous people living around Lake Texcoco in Mexico confronted a $13bn international airport \u2013 one of the biggest infrastructure projects in Latin America \u2013 and, across 17 years, and despite all predictions, won. The campaign was built on the principle that their land and community were not for sale, however much money might be offered. This ensured that the Mexican government\u2019s only remaining strategy was force. But the people had created such strong community organisations and attracted so much support from other Mexicans that force ceased to be an option. This suggests another crucial element: a protest community strong enough to resist all attempts at division and co-option. Such communities do not arise by accident but are consciously and carefully constructed, often with the help of training, music and fun. They must be strong enough to support people threatened by despair, burnout or breakdown, especially when the response gets nasty. Already, conspiracy theories are being spread by politicians and the media, suggesting that the young people have been organised by unknown sinister forces: after all, how could children possibly organise themselves? Greta Thunberg, whose school strike sparked this movement, has written a response far more dignified and mature than the articles attacking her. But the nastiness has only just begun. As some of us can testify, the viciousness of the lobby groups funded by the fossil fuel industry, and the publications that amplify their message, knows no limits. As we have already seen, they treat even children as fair game. I would suggest that the climate strikers develop clear rules of engagement, in order to give their opponents no ammunition. In my view, the global justice movement was gravely damaged by its failure to exclude or contain the black bloc: people dressed in black, some of whom came to protests tooled up for a fight and often smashed up random local businesses, denting support for the mobilisation with every blow. Some people in the movement believed that everyone had a right to join it on whatever terms they wished. I see this as an unaffordable indulgence. A good exercise is to ask yourself what the police and authorities would most like to happen, then do the opposite. They would love a violent faction to emerge that would erode the young strikers\u2019 credibility and provide an excuse to send in the riot police and break up the protests. Never give them this excuse. Successful movements also need an organisational model that allows them to keep growing.

      "body": "<p>There are dark clouds over the beaches of Malibu, where a storm is raging. It all seems ridiculously out of place \u2013 and so does Larry Charles. The director of Curb Your Enthusiasm and Borat may live in the rarefied hills nearby, but as he emerges from the rain in his camouflage jacket, grey hoodie and long white beard, you can\u2019t help thinking he\u2019s exactly the sort of person who would trouble the Neighbourhood Watch.</p> <p>His latest project, he tells me, was inspired by the feelings of restlessness he experiences living here in Hollywood\u2019s gilded cage. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to wind up being complacent, safe and secure,\u201d says Charles. \u201cThat isn\u2019t why I got into comedy. I wanted to seek out what\u2019s funny in different environments. I wanted to ask a member of Isis what they laugh about.\u201d</p> <p>So he did. At one point in his new documentary series, <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80188051\">Larry Charles\u2019 Dangerous World of Comedy</a>, he visits a prison in Kirkuk, northern Iraq, to meet a captured Isis fighter who says his new guards are much funnier than the humourless terrorists he\u2019s used to hanging around with. \u201cHe seemed sweet,\u201d says Charles. \u201cYou realise there is a face to terrorism that is not the face you think.\u201d</p> <p>Their interview took place the day Mosul was recaptured by the Iraqi government. Charles could see the battle raging on the horizon. Worse still, traffic was a complete nightmare. \u201cPeople were trying to get back to their houses,\u201d he says, \u201ceven though they were bombed out. In Malibu, when we had to get out of our houses because of the fires, I was able to check into a hotel. That\u2019s not an option in Kirkuk.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9a2d31ab6af0c7bc87f80d92da1c919832f726a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9a2d31ab6af0c7bc87f80d92da1c919832f726a/0_37_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Exactly the sort of person who would trouble the Neighbourhood Watch\u2019 ...

Larry Charles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AF archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Charles has lived in the relative safety of Los Angeles since the 1970s when, as a teenager, he came here to sell jokes outside the Comedy Store. \u201cI did standup too,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I could never be the funniest version of myself onstage.\u201d</p> <p>While working as a writer on a sketch show called Fridays, he met Larry David, who would go on to create and star in Curb Your Enthusiasm. David hired him for Seinfeld. It all seems like a simpler era, says Charles. \u201cSeinfeld was a product of its time,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe got complacent as a culture. We thought everything was secure and we didn\u2019t expect it to be yanked away. Now there\u2019s a mad scramble. The best comedy reflects the anxiety the culture has.\u201d</p> <p>Charles\u2019s first film as a director was 2003\u2019s Masked and Anonymous, a strange tale about a rock icon playing a benefit concert for a decaying, dystopian America co-written with and starring Bob Dylan. \u201cHe\u2019s hilarious,\u201d says Charles. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid of being misunderstood. He taught me you have to trust yourself, and he does. He doesn\u2019t think twice.\u201d</p> <p>In his Dangerous World of Comedy, Charles visits places most white Americans would fear to tread, including Somalia, Liberia, Saudi Arabia and a Native American reservation in Minnesota. Just as the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/09/anthony-bourdain-obituary\">Anthony Bourdain </a>used food to take his fans to parts of the world they couldn\u2019t find on a map, Charles uses comedy as a prism through which to view humanity. \u201cI was a big fan of Bourdain,\u201d he says. \u201cLike me, he\u2019s an older white man trying to be cool in these different situations. And he was. Ultimately, the lesson that I learned, and that he learned, is how similar everybody is.\u201d</p> <p>In Somalia, Charles meets a defector from al-Shabaab, an extremist group of Islamic militants. The man once laughed at enemy corpses being dragged behind trucks. Now, he mostly hears laughter mocking him for getting brainwashed into joining a terrorist organisation. It\u2019s a startling illustration of the chasm between our desire to make people laugh and our paranoia about people laughing at us.</p> <p>\u201cPeople often feel that\u2019s the worst thing that can happen to you,\u201d says Charles, \u201cwhich means \u2013 in a Seinfeldian, Curbian sort of way \u2013 it\u2019s also the funniest thing that can happen to you. That\u2019s why I\u2019m always looking for comedy that really isn\u2019t funny. You say, \u2018That\u2019s not funny.\u2019 Then you move it 10 degrees and suddenly it\u2019s hilarious, because it\u2019s catharsis.\u201d</p> <p>Charles cites the first screenings of Borat, the 2006 mockumentary in which Sacha Baron Cohen played a Kazakh journalist travelling through America, speaking to anyone vain, gullible or fried enough to believe he was genuine. It was as hilarious as it was cringe-making. \u201cThe audience reacted like it was a horror movie,\u201d he says. \u201cI loved that. People were screaming and looking away. That kind of visceral reaction is hard to manufacture.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb5aacee129007a7e96a8747cee3a097f80564a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb5aacee129007a7e96a8747cee3a097f80564a9/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Larry Charles talking to General Butt Naked.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Charred human remains taste like pork ribs\u2019 ...

In Liberia, he meets the former warlord General Butt Naked, who earned that nickname after claiming to have taken troops into battle naked.</p> <p>The general talks about murdering children, and reminisces about how charred human remains taste \u201clike pork ribs\u201d. He then reveals prosaically that he is a big fan of Kids Say the Darndest Things, the US comedy series hosted by Bill Cosby that ran in the late 1990s. Who would have thought one man could share a taste for both Cosby and human flesh? \u201cWell, to me it\u2019s not that far removed,\u201d Charles says drily. \u201cI never thought, when I was a child, that connection would be made. But here it is.\u201d</p> <p>Later, Charles finds himself on the receiving end of a determinedly unfunny antisemitic rant by the white supremacist hacker Andrew \u201cWeev\u201d Auernheimer. Then the alt-right troll Baked Alaska tells him that Borat \u2013 a movie in which Baron Cohen says of a Jewish woman \u201cyou can barely see her horns\u201d <em>\u2013 </em>is one of his \u201cbiggest influences\u201d. Baked Alaska tells Charles he was excited to meet him because \u201cif anyone\u2019s going to get me, it\u2019s going to be you\u201d. In voiceover, Charles says: \u201cOh shit, really?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b803d377ef44a61c8b6c32232047ff5bdcb1fdea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b803d377ef44a61c8b6c32232047ff5bdcb1fdea/120_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Oh shit, really?\u2019 Alt-right comedian Baked Alaska tells Larry Charles that Borat was one of his biggest influences.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Oh shit, really?\u2019 Alt-right comedian Baked Alaska tells Charles that Borat was one of his biggest influences.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThat threw me,\u201d he says now. \u201cBut I know one of the secrets of Borat\u2019s success was how many people took it literally. Some people didn\u2019t see it as a satire \u2013 they just saw a rude guy speaking their language.\u201d Did he not feel more responsibility to make sure the audience got the joke? \u201cI don\u2019t think so, in the same way that a poet is not responsible for explaining what a poem is about. You can\u2019t control that. It\u2019s the consequence of freedom.\u201d</p> <p>He does say, though, that he wouldn\u2019t make Borat the same way now. \u201cDefinitely not,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a product of the George W Bush era. It was about that cultural imperialism. It was cashing in on our ignorance about the rest of the world. That\u2019s what this new show is about too.\u201d</p> <p>Before he moved to LA, Charles grew up in Brooklyn \u2013 in Trump Village, the housing project built by the US president\u2019s father. Charles says he will, at least begrudgingly, defend anyone\u2019s right to say anything, but I wonder if he\u2019s concerned this belief leads inevitably to political campaigns run on lies, vague rhetoric and racial slurs. Is President Trump the logical consequence of unchecked free speech? \u201cIf he is \u2013 and I accept the fact that it\u2019s a possibility \u2013 then society created the environment for that to happen. We tend to be very apathetic about what\u2019s going on, and Trump is emblematic of that because he\u2019s apathetic too. He also tries to be funny, but he\u2019s a bad comedian.\u201d</p> <p>One of the things Charles has found on his travels is that there\u2019s never a subject so dark somebody won\u2019t laugh at it. From General Butt Naked to Donald Trump, the prisons of Iraq to the battlefields of Somalia, he finds humans reckoning with the greatest joke of all: the absurdity of life when faced with the inevitability of death.</p> <p>\u201cYou could say the fear of death drives it all,\u201d says Charles. \u201cThat\u2019s a very primal fear, and releasing it is where the deepest and most resonant laughs reside. Once you let go, it\u2019s hilariously funny because it\u2019s so absurd. Why go through it all? That\u2019s still a great question.

      "body": "<p>When at the age of 15 I decided that I would one day become a film director, film seemed to be living up to Lenin\u2019s famous definition as \u201cthe most important of the arts\u201d. It was the mid-1960s and arthouse cinema was at its peak, with such incredible personalities as Ingmar Bergman, Alain Resnais, Federico Fellini, Carol Reed, Andrzej Wajda and Akira Kurosawa. They were all bound by a single shared experience: each, as grown, mature people, had lived through the atrocities of the second world war, even if for some of them it had not been that immediate. The experience of war provided them with a feeling of responsibility for what kind of stories they told and what formal choices they made, and an awareness that the world was infinitely complicated, that people were capable of absolutely anything.</p> <p>The next generation introduced a kind of anarchic boldness, which in various countries led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1968-the-year-of-revolt\" title=\"\">the uprisings of 1968</a>, student movements, hippy culture, the whiff of freedom behind the iron curtain. Cinema started to use artistic styles that earlier had been present in poetry or other visual arts. In Poland, my homeland, a new group of film-makers coalesced around two of our older colleagues, Wajda and Krzysztof Zanussi, in the 1970s.</p> <p>Life under communism was threatening, but we were able to circumvent the system. We learned to trick the censors, because we knew that we were in a beautiful synergy with our audience, who could decipher metaphors, allegories, symbols. We wanted to tell stories about the contemporary world and voice our collective anger. In the summer of 1980 this joined with the anger of workers from the Gda\u0144sk shipyard, whose strike led to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2019/feb/06/polish-round-table-talks-1989\" title=\"\">creation of the Solidarity movement</a>. It was then that we Polish film-makers felt an incredible sense of agency.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/feb/15/antisemitism-rising-sharply-across-europe-latest-figures-show\">Antisemitism rising sharply across Europe, latest figures show</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the 1990s the world started to become more even. The iron curtain was gone. The Soviet Union collapsed, burying \u2013 as we then thought, once and for all \u2013 the temptations of totalitarian ideas and the illusion of a bright future for global communism. A return of fascist-like ideology seemed even more absurd. There was a vaccine of sorts against that: the memory of the Holocaust. The creation of the European Union was meant to guarantee a permanent immunity against this awful temptation. There seemed to be no other option than capitalism, liberal democracy and the free market.</p> <p>Meanwhile, new challenges and fears were rising. The Soviet Union was terrible to its citizens and to those of its satellite states, but its very existence added a counterbalance of humanity to western capitalism. When it fell, the ghost that tempered the merciless egoism of capitalism disappeared with it: the rich started to get richer faster, the poor got poorer. Consumption and new technologies became our favourite form of entertainment, a doorway to escape from the real world.

      "bodyText": "When at the age of 15 I decided that I would one day become a film director, film seemed to be living up to Lenin\u2019s famous definition as \u201cthe most important of the arts\u201d. It was the mid-1960s and arthouse cinema was at its peak, with such incredible personalities as Ingmar Bergman, Alain Resnais, Federico Fellini, Carol Reed, Andrzej Wajda and Akira Kurosawa. They were all bound by a single shared experience: each, as grown, mature people, had lived through the atrocities of the second world war, even if for some of them it had not been that immediate. The experience of war provided them with a feeling of responsibility for what kind of stories they told and what formal choices they made, and an awareness that the world was infinitely complicated, that people were capable of absolutely anything. The next generation introduced a kind of anarchic boldness, which in various countries led to the uprisings of 1968, student movements, hippy culture, the whiff of freedom behind the iron curtain. Cinema started to use artistic styles that earlier had been present in poetry or other visual arts. In Poland, my homeland, a new group of film-makers coalesced around two of our older colleagues, Wajda and Krzysztof Zanussi, in the 1970s. Life under communism was threatening, but we were able to circumvent the system. We learned to trick the censors, because we knew that we were in a beautiful synergy with our audience, who could decipher metaphors, allegories, symbols. We wanted to tell stories about the contemporary world and voice our collective anger. In the summer of 1980 this joined with the anger of workers from the Gda\u0144sk shipyard, whose strike led to the creation of the Solidarity movement. It was then that we Polish film-makers felt an incredible sense of agency. In the 1990s the world started to become more even. The iron curtain was gone. The Soviet Union collapsed, burying \u2013 as we then thought, once and for all \u2013 the temptations of totalitarian ideas and the illusion of a bright future for global communism. A return of fascist-like ideology seemed even more absurd. There was a vaccine of sorts against that: the memory of the Holocaust. The creation of the European Union was meant to guarantee a permanent immunity against this awful temptation. There seemed to be no other option than capitalism, liberal democracy and the free market. Meanwhile, new challenges and fears were rising. The Soviet Union was terrible to its citizens and to those of its satellite states, but its very existence added a counterbalance of humanity to western capitalism. When it fell, the ghost that tempered the merciless egoism of capitalism disappeared with it: the rich started to get richer faster, the poor got poorer. Consumption and new technologies became our favourite form of entertainment, a doorway to escape from the real world. Cinema became as boring as life in the vacuum of neoliberalism. I started to feel more and more that the role of audiovisual narratives was to provide an escape from reality. Art and entertainment \u2013 much like politics \u2013 started to become an escape from freedom. Being free meant being responsible, and what kind of duties would this mean for film-makers? I felt somehow different from my peers in the west, but even more different from younger generations of film-makers. I was born shortly after the second world war, I grew up in the ruins of Warsaw, and I wore the stigma of the trauma experienced by my Jewish father, a communist who at the beginning of the war escaped to Soviet Russia and fought there, unaware of the fact that he had lost his whole family in the Shoah (he never spoke about it). He believed in communism, in a future beaming with universal happiness for humanity. Instead, what he got was injustice, false accusations, corruption of the initial ideology, suffering and death for those who tried to fight for freedom. He came to realise that he was in part responsible for this terrible lie. At the age of 41 he was arrested by the security services, and after being harassed during the hearing, he took his own life. I was 13 at that time, and from that point on, my father\u2019s surname (which in his honour I kept, even after getting married) became a sign of shame in communist Poland. I experienced an outburst of hope when I was at film school, and a carnival of freedom (as Milan Kundera would call it) during the Prague spring. I saw the Soviet tanks on the streets of Prague in August 1968, the resistance of the society, which ended in the self-immolation of Jan Palach, followed by the spread of a collective conformism and resignation.

      "bodyText": "The Australian defence department can\u2019t guarantee that Canberra-made remote weapons systems, that attracted a taxpayer subsidy, won\u2019t be used in the bloody Yemen conflict. Officials faced a grilling over military exports to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday following revelations Electro Optic Systems is exporting 500 of the systems to the Saudi interior ministry. The ABC reported the company had received $36m in government funding. The systems hold military cannons, machine guns and missile launchers which mount on the back of vehicles or ships, allowing weapons to be operated from inside. The defence minister, Christopher Pyne, inspected the EOS factory in Canberra January last year at a time when the company was spruiking a $410m deal to supply remote weapons systems to an unnamed overseas customer. At the IDEX arms fair in Abu Dhabi this week, the United Arab Emirates identified itself as the end customer. The UAE is also involved in the Yemen conflict. During a Senate estimates hearing on Wednesday in Canberra, the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, asked defence officials multiple times whether the weapons systems would be used in Yemen. Department official Tom Hamilton sidestepped the questions, but said Australia always assessed the risk of weapons being used to commit human rights abuses. \u201cI can say categorically that our assessment process is followed for each and every permit and that includes an assessment of the overriding risk that they\u2019ll be used in human rights abuses,\u201d he said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t help the four-year-old kid who had their leg blown off,\u201d Di Natale responded during a testy exchange. The assessment criteria for export permits included international obligations, national security, regional security and foreign policy, Hamilton said. This week a British parliamentary committee report said the UK is on \u201cthe wrong side of the law\u201d by sanctioning arms exports to Saudi Arabia and should suspend export licences. Germany has suspended arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and Italy, Denmark and Finland, have announced plans to follow suit. The US Congress has voted to withdraw US support from involvement in Yemen. In the wake of last year\u2019s murder of Washington Post reporter Jamal Khashoggi, the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said \u201call options remain on the table\u201d including a possible Australian ban on arms sales to Saudi Arabia. \u201cThat position hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Payne said. Asked if Australia was condoning the activities of the Saudi regime, Payne defended the government\u2019s military export approval processes. An estimated 85,000 children under the age of five have starved to death over the last three years as a result of Yemen\u2019s civil war, according to aid group Save the Children. Human Rights Watch\u2019s Australia director Elaine Pearson criticised Australia\u2019s ongoing secrecy on arms sales to the Middle East. She said if the EOS weapons systems were being used by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen that would be in violation of the arms trade treaty. \u201cThe Saudi-led coalition has repeatedly flouted the laws of war and thousands of civilians have been killed in unlawful strikes,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cAustralia has to be very careful that its military sales aren\u2019t complicit in facilitating unlawful attacks in Yemen.\u201d EOS is not the only Australian defence company with Middle East links it has tried to keep quiet. Perth\u2019s Barrett Communications announced in June it had completed a $7m contract for tactical VHF radio equipment to an \u201cunnamed Middle Eastern military force\u201d. The equipment included hand portable, manpack, mobile and base stations. Barrett Communications\u2019s chief executive officer, Andrew Burt, declined to answer questions from Guardian Australia about whether the radio gear was exported to Saudi Arabia or the UAE. \u201cAs a private business it is our policy not to comment on questions of this nature, other than to confirm that we adhere to the strict requirements applied to us by the department of export control,\u201d he said. Melbourne-based Defence Vision, which manufactures gyro-stabilised camera systems for drones, vehicles and ships, has denied it is supplying its products to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. In May last year, the company put out a press release stating it was \u201clooking for distributors to tap into the Middle Eastern market\u201d and was hoping to gain a foothold in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. \u201cWe are doing nothing in the Middle East at the moment. We didn\u2019t get a lot of interest from that part of the world,\u201d the general manager, Jason Beasleigh, said on Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever done [a deal with Saudi Arabia], certainly not in my time.\u201d He said the parent company, Ascent Vision, formerly UAV, was at the IDEX arms fair this week.",

      "bodyText": "In the wake of mass fish kills in the Menindee Lakes in January and scorching criticism of its stewardship of the Murray-Darling Basin, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority has announced that it will upgrade its scientific work on climate change and the river system. The authority\u2019s chief executive, Phillip Glyde, has invited the scientific community to collaborate on its work on climate change. \u201cThe overwhelming scientific consensus is that climate change is currently affecting the Basin so more work is needed to inform future management strategies,\u201d Glyde said. \u201cThe MDBA\u2019s discussion paper kicks off the next phase of work to better understand the likely impacts of climate change on the Basin in the future and to identify where the information gaps are.\u201d But the MDBA has strongly rejected the findings of the South Australian Royal Commission into the Murray Darling which accused it of gross maladministration of the plan. It said the royal commission effectively proposed abandoning the basin plan and starting again. \u201cThe MDBA considers this would be a reckless act \u2013 setting back progress towards a healthy and sustainable Basin, and causing substantial uncertainty for Basin communities,\u201d Glyde said. \u201cWhile many people support the concept of a Basin Plan, there is often sharp disagreement up and down the rivers, and across different stakeholder groups, about the most appropriate settings,\u201d he said. The MDBA\u2019s role was to apply the best available science, feedback from the community and expert judgement to administer the plan and propose amendments. On Monday a group of eminent scientists convened by the Academy of Science released a report saying that the fish kills at Menindee, which killed up to one million fish, were due to the low flows, caused by over-extraction upstream and exacerbated by the drought. \u201cOur review of the fish kills found there isn\u2019t enough water in the Darling system to avoid catastrophic outcomes,\u201d they warned. The scientists pointed to serious deficiencies in governance and management, which have eroded the intent of the Water Act 2007 and the framework of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. One of the main criticisms of the basin plan by the royal commission and by scientists has been that the MDBA\u2019s models use historical data to assess the variability of flows in the river, but do not take account of how climate change may be permanently altering rainfall and flows in the river system. The models and the whole basin plan was based on work done in 2009 and it did not include any mechanism for taking account of climate change. It is due to be reviewed in 2026, but scientists say there is an urgent need to update the plan and the models that inform it, in light of what is actually happening to the river. The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists released a report last week, which studied the actual flows at two sites along the river \u2013 Wilcannia and Chowilla. It found that actual flows were much lower than those predicted to occur as a result of the plan being implemented. The MDBA says that\u2019s because the plan is partway through but in the case of the floodplains at Chowilla, none of the targets for environmental inundations needed to keep river red gums alive had been reached. Glyde said the basin plan was drafted \u201cas an adaptive plan with climate change in mind\u201d though almost every decision to amend the plan has been about reducing environmental water targets in favour of irrigators. Glyde acknowledged that the information about climate change, particularly in the northern basin, had advanced. \u201cWe now know more. Rainfall patterns are changing and these changes will increase pressure on the health of the basin\u2019s environment, its communities and its economy,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont whose 2016 presidential campaign helped energize the progressive movement and reshaped the Democratic party, has entered the 2020 race for the White House. Sanders, a self-styled democratic socialist who spent much of his nearly 30-year congressional career on the political fringe, cast his candidacy as the best way to accomplish the mission he started three years ago when he ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. \u201cTogether, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution,\u201d he said in an email announcing his decision to supporters on Tuesday morning. \u201cNow, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for.\u201d Sanders, 77, running as a Democrat again, believes he can prevail in a crowded and diverse field that includes several female and minority candidates, and then beat Donald Trump, whom he called on Tuesday \u201cthe most dangerous president in modern American history\u201d. Asked in an interview on CBS on Tuesday morning what would be different about his 2020 campaign, Sanders replied: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win.\u201d Whether he can once again capture grassroots support, and whether the energy of his past campaign will pass to other candidates, will likely be a central factor in determining who Democrats nominate to take on the sitting president. The progressive policies Sanders helped popularize in 2016 \u2013 Medicare for All, a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage, tuition-free college, demands to fight climate change more aggressively and to tax the wealthy at a higher rate \u2013 have now been broadly embraced by several other presidential candidates. Sanders wrore: \u201cThree years ago, during our 2016 campaign, when we brought forth our progressive agenda we were told that our ideas were \u2018radical\u2019 and \u2018extreme\u2019. Well, three years have come and gone. And, as result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans.\u201d Sanders will face opposition from moderate Democrats and from Republicans who are likely to use his candidacy to paint the party as too liberal. In a preview of Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, the president used his State of the Union speech this month to warn against what he said was the creep of socialism in America. Trump 2020 campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement: \u201cBernie Sanders has already won the debate in the Democrat primary, because every candidate is embracing his brand of socialism. \u201cBut the American people will reject an agenda of sky-high tax rates, government-run health care and coddling dictators like those in Venezuela. Only President Trump will keep America free, prosperous and safe.\u201d Sanders made clear on Tuesday that he plans to go after Trump directly in his campaign. In an interview with Vermont Public Radio, where he first announced his bid, he said: \u201cI think the current occupant of the White House is an embarrassment to our country. I think he is a pathological liar. I also think he is a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, somebody who is gaining cheap political points by trying to pick on minorities, often undocumented immigrants.\u201d After a midterm election cycle that saw women and minority candidates sweep to power, the nominating contest is likely to be fought not only over ideology but over identity and electoral strategy. Already, the 2020 candidates are being pushed on how they can appeal to the Democrats\u2019 broad range of demographic groups, which includes working-class families, black and Latino voters, suburban women and young people. This year, Sanders apologized publicly and privately to former female staffers after allegations of sexual harassment by male staffers on his 2016 campaign. He has also continued to stumble on questions about race, despite a years-long effort to improve his standing with minority voters. Still, no candidate will enter the race with as many advantages as Sanders, who ended the 2016 primary with more than 13m votes and nearly $230m raised, much of it through small donations. Now he begins a second run not as a political outsider but as a top-tier candidate with near-universal name recognition, a dedicated following and an unrivaled donor list. Yet he will likely face far greater scrutiny, in a growing field already populated by colleagues and allies including the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, his closest friend in Congress. Senators Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have all entered the race, as have lower-profile contenders including the former San Antonio mayor and federal housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and Pete Buttigieg, the young mayor of South Bend, Indiana. The former vice-president Joe Biden, former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke and billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg are all weighing whether to run. With a fractured Democratic field, advisers believe Sanders\u2019 core support, should he retain it over the next year, will be enough to power his campaign in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, the early voting states that helped lift his 2016 campaign. He is likely to benefit from a campaign waged by his allies to reform the party\u2019s primary process, which succeeded in stripping voting power from the so-called \u201csuperdelegates\u201d, a major source of controversy in 2016 when Sanders lost the battle for the nomination to Clinton. Born to Jewish parents with roots in Poland and Russia, Sanders grew up poor in a cramped apartment in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from the University of Chicago, where he became involved in the civil rights movement. In 1981, he was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont. In 1990, Sanders became the state\u2019s sole representative in Congress, where he served until he joined the Senate in 2006.

Local Democracy Matters, a group set up to fight the amalgamation of Randwick and Waverley councils 18 months ago, is seeking to halt the demolition of the stadium before the election by arguing the government failed to follow its own planning rules. Wednesday was the first day of an expedited trial in the NSW land and environment court against Infrastructure NSW, the government agency responsible for the $700m demolition and rebuild. In his opening address Tim Robertson, the group\u2019s barrister, argued the government had failed to exhibit the development application for the required period, didn\u2019t follow design excellence criteria and failed to follow its own rules on contaminated soils. During the trial on Wednesday, Robertson said the government had \u201csuppressed\u201d information about contamination on the site \u2013 pointing to a consultants report prepared for the government which found \u201ccarcinogenic\u201d materials on the site, as well as a number of other contaminants. A draft version of the report was prepared in June \u2013 during the exhibition period for the stadium demolition. Robertson told the court the report should have prompted \u201cfurther investigation\u201d by the government. \u201cThat fact was known by Infrastructure NSW, but suppressed,\u201d he said. \u201cThey knew it during the exhibition period.\u201d But the barrister for the government, Sandra Duggan SC, interjected to call Robertson\u2019s claim the report was suppressed \u201coutrageous\u201d, accusing him of \u201cplaying to the gallery\u201d. \u201cThere is no evidence my client had this document within that period.

We\u2019ve got to continue to work hard and prepare well. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m on a different path or timeline to anyone else as it is for a player. Over the pre-season I\u2019ve been refereeing a lot of opposed sessions with the Broncos and Titans. That\u2019s good for my development as well.\u201d Sleeman is hoping to follow in the footsteps of Eleni Glouftsis, who made AFL history in 2016 when she became the first female field umpire to officiate a top-level men\u2019s game in a pre-season clash. Glouftsis went on to officiate her first regular season game in 2017.",

If true, it would be yet another example of Trump seeking to influence the FBI and Justice Department and interfering with inquiries involving himself.</li> \n   <li>House Democrats are investigating whether the White House pursued a project to share nuclear technology information with Saudi Arabia. Trunp\u2019s close ties to the Saudis have already been a subject of controversy following the Kingdom\u2019s hand in executing journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</li> \n   <li>The FBI reportedly had a backup plan to protect evidence in the Russia investigation after Trump fired its director, James Comey. </li> \n   <li>Michael Bennet, a senator from Colorado, is heading to the early battleground of Iowa as he tests the waters for a 2020 presidential campaign.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from me, Sabrina Siddiqui, until next time.

The goal was to ensure that the information collected under the investigations, which included probes of Trump associates and possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign, would survive the firings or reassignments of top law enforcement officials. Those officials included special counsel Robert Mueller, who was appointed eight days after Trump fired Comey in May 2017.</p> \n   <p>Andrew McCabe, who became acting director after Comey was fired, asked investigators to develop a plan to ensure evidence would be protected, said the person, who was not authorized to talk about those discussions publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity to the Associated Press. A plan was then created, according to the person, who would not provide specifics. A second person familiar with the talks, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, also said the FBI discussed preserving evidence so that it would outlast any firing or effort to stymie the investigation.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>As I mentioned earlier, McCabe is currently causing quite the stir with revelations from his new book, The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump.</p> \n  <p>Quite the literal book title, it seems!<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T19:42:10.233Z\">at 7.42pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c6c4dc9e4b0793c8d0b2271\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T19:00:49.641Z\">7.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump sought to influence investigation into hush money payments: report</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This one is quite the doozy from the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-investigations.html\">New York Times</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> As federal prosecutors in Manhattan gathered evidence late last year about President Trump\u2019s role in silencing women with hush payments during the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump called Matthew G. Whitaker, his newly installed attorney general, with a question. He asked whether Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York and a Trump ally, could be put in charge of the widening investigation, according to several American officials with direct knowledge of the call.</p> \n   <p>Mr. Whitaker, who had privately told associates that part of his role at the Justice Department was to \u201cjump on a grenade\u201d for the president, knew he could not put Mr. Berman in charge, since Mr. Berman had already recused himself from the investigation. The president soon soured on Mr. Whitaker, as he often does with his aides, and complained about his inability to pull levers at the Justice Department that could make the president\u2019s many legal problems go away.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Allow me to refresh your memory...</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>At least two women were paid six figures in hush money in 2016 to prevent them from speaking about their alleged affairs with Trump: one was adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who was paid $130,000 by Trump\u2019s former attorney Michael Cohen in exchange for her silence; the other was former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who received $150,000 from the National Enquirer, the tabloid owned by a close friend of Trump\u2019s, for exclusive rights to her story that was then never published in a practice known as \u2018catch-and-kill\u2019.<br></li> \n   <li>These payments are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/12/michael-cohen-sentence-latest-news-trump-hush-money-payments-lying-charges\">under investigation</a> by prosecutors in the southern district of New York, which is also examining what Trump knew about them. Cohen, who struck a plea deal with federal investigators, has already said Trump knew about both payments.</li> \n   <li>After firing attorney general Jeff Sessions in November, Trump installed Justice Department official <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/11/13/18087560/matt-whitaker-mueller-trump-sessions\">Matthew Whitaker</a> as the acting AG -- bypassing the chain of command and inviting questions over the legality of Whitaker\u2019s appointment.</li> \n   <li>Whitaker had previously been critical of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia and is widely regarded as a loyalist.</li> \n   <li>This latest report now essentially suggests that Trump directly asked Whitaker to put another loyalist in charge of an investigation into the president himself. (It appears Whitaker declined to do so.)</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>This is also notable because earlier this month, Whitaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/feb/08/donald-trump-latest-news-live-matt-whitaker-testify\">testified before Congress</a> and said, under oath, that he never discussed the Russia investigation with the president.

The U.S. embassy is flying in LGBT activists from across Europe for a strategy dinner to plan to push for decriminalization in places that still outlaw homosexuality \u2014 mostly concentrated in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean.</p> \n   <p>Although the decriminalization strategy is still being hashed out, officials say it\u2019s likely to include working with global organizations like the United Nations, the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as other countries whose laws already allow for gay rights. Other U.S. embassies and diplomatic posts throughout Europe, including the U.S. Mission to the E.U., are involved, as is the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. </p> \n   <p>Narrowly focused on criminalization, rather than broader LGBT issues like same-sex marriage, the campaign was conceived partly in response to the recent reported execution by hanging of a young gay man in Iran, the Trump administration\u2019s top geopolitical foe.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The move to focus the conversation on Iran could, however, cast a spotlight on other nations with which the Trump administration shares close ties, such as Saudi Arabia. The Saudi kingdom is among those to find homosexuality punishable by death; but Trump has continued to defend Riyadh amid human rights abuses that include the execution of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October.<br></p> \n  <p>The Trump administration has also been criticized at home for rescinding protections enacted by Barack Obama that sought to weed out discrimination against the LGBTQ community. The president undid an Obama-era rule that had enforced workplace protections for LGBTQ people and banned transgender people from serving in the military.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c6c4635e4b051cdac4f0159\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-19T18:10:18.079Z\">6.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some more on the donations pouring into Bernie Sanders 2020 via our stellar political correspondent, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laurenegambino\">Lauren Gambino</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In the first four hours after Bernie Sanders launched his campaign, he raised $1.2 million from 42,000 donors w/ sign ups and donations from all 50 states, according to a spokeswoman for his campaign.</p> \n   <p>Senator Kamala Harris raises $1.5 from roughly 38,000 donors in the first 24-hours of her campaign, which was close to the amount Sanders raised in the first day of his 2016 presidential campaign. <br></p> \n   <p>Sanders appears outpace to outraise Harris, which would be unsurprising given his sky-high name recognition and small-dollar fundraising prowess.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for sticking with us, everyone. See you tomorrow! The Trump administration announced that it intends to pull funding for California\u2019s high-speed rail project, one week after Governor Gavin Newsom tussled with the president on Twitter and one day after California led a coalition of 16 states in a lawsuit against the administration over the president\u2019s decision to declare a national emergency for border wall funding. Attorneys for Nick Sandmann, the Kentucky student filmed in an apparent confrontation with a Native American elder at the Lincoln Memorial, filed a defamation lawsuit against the Washington Post, accusing the news organization of engaging \u201cin a modern-day form of McCarthyism.\u201d. CNN hired longtime Republican operative Sarah Isgur as the political editor charged with coordinating 2020 campaign coverage. Isgur once retweeted someone calling her new employer the \u201cClinton News Network.\u201d One week after President Trump called California\u2019s high-speed rail project a \u201c\u2018green\u2019 disaster\u201d, the US Department of Transportation announced plans to cancel $929m in federal grant funds yet to be paid toward the $77bn endeavor. The department also \u201cit is actively exploring every legal option to seek the return from California of $2.5bn in federal funds FRA (Federal Railroad Administration) previously granted,\u201d according to the statement released Tuesday. The Federal Railroad Administration determined that the California High-Speed Rail Authority, the state-run organization tasked with overseeing the project \u201chas materially failed to comply with the terms\u201d of the agreement that promised $929m in federal funds for construction, wrote Federal Railroad Administrator Ronald Batory, in a letter to the Brian Kelly, the California High-Speed Rail Authority\u2019s chief executive. The Authority \u201chas failed to make reasonable progress, Batory wrote, and will not complete the project by the end of 2022, as was previously agreed upon, Batory wrote. In addition, Batory cited Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s recent remarks during his state of the state address, saying that Newsom \u201chad \u201cpresented a new proposal that represents a significant retreat from the state\u2019s initial vision and commitment and frustrates the purpose for which federal funding was awarded. Newsom had said that \u201cthe project, as currently planned, would cost too much and take too long\u201d. Opponents of the ambitious project interpreted his comments as a declaration that \u201cthe train to nowhere has finally stopped\u201d and that Newsom was canceling the leg of the plan that extended the railway from San Francisco to Los Angeles. But Newsom\u2019s office later clarified that he meant only that \u201cwe have to be realistic about the project\u201d. In response to his remarks, Trump sent out a tweet asking for the return of \u201cthree and a half billion dollars\u201d. Newsom responded by tweeting that the money was \u201callocated by Congress for this project. We\u2019re not giving it back.\u201d \u201cThe train is leaving the station \u2014 better get on board!\u201d the governor wrote. The transportation department\u2019s announcement came one day after California led a coalition of 16 states to sue the Trump administration over the president\u2019s decision to declare a national emergency for border wall funding. Attorneys for the Kentucky student filmed in an apparent confrontation with a Native American elder at the Lincoln Memorial filed a lawsuit against the Washington Post on Tuesday, accusing the news organization of engaging \u201cin a modern-day form of McCarthyism.\u201d CNN hired longtime Republican operative Sarah Isgur as the political editor charged with coordinating 2020 campaign coverage, Vox is reporting. According to a CNN spokesperson, Isgur, who most recently worked as the Department of Justice\u2019s main spokesperson under then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, will coordinate the network\u2019s political coverage for the 2020 election cycle on TV and on CNN\u2019s website. Isgur starts work next month, and will not be involved in coverage of DOJ. She will occasionally appear on TV. Isgur\u2019s LinkedIn page indicates she has no journalism experience. She has, however, worked for a variety of right-wing organizations and campaigns, including the Carly Fiorina and Mitt Romney presidential bids, the Republican National Committee, and a Ted Cruz US Senate campaign. Coming as it does in the wake of a presidential cycle in which the mainstream media\u2019s fixation on Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails (among other issues) was widely criticized, news of Isgur\u2019s hiring sparked concerns about the direction CNN is taking heading into 2020. News of her hiring comes on the heels of mass layoffs throughout the media industry that has some wondering why CNN couldn\u2019t have hired someone with at least some journalism experience. Now that things have quieted down a bit, here\u2019s a look at some of our coverage from earlier. Hey everybody, Vivian Ho on the west coast here, taking over for Sabrina Siddiqui. Let\u2019s see what the rest of the day has in store for us, shall we? Ok folks, I\u2019m handing over the blog to my ever capable colleague, Vivian Ho, who will take you through key moments for the remainder of the day. But first, a recap of what all has happened so far: Bernie Sanders officially launched his second presidential campaign, joining a crowded field of 2020 contenders. But while the Vermont senator inspired a grassroots movement in 2016, can he recapture the excitement with several other progressives in the race? The president reportedly asked acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker to install a loyalist at the helm of a federal investigation into hush money paid to women alleging affairs with Trump. If true, it would be yet another example of Trump seeking to influence the FBI and Justice Department and interfering with inquiries involving himself. House Democrats are investigating whether the White House pursued a project to share nuclear technology information with Saudi Arabia. Trunp\u2019s close ties to the Saudis have already been a subject of controversy following the Kingdom\u2019s hand in executing journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The FBI reportedly had a backup plan to protect evidence in the Russia investigation after Trump fired its director, James Comey. Michael Bennet, a senator from Colorado, is heading to the early battleground of Iowa as he tests the waters for a 2020 presidential campaign. That\u2019s it from me, Sabrina Siddiqui, until next time. But stay tuned to this space for more updates from Vivian! *** Sign up for our morning briefing for a global perspective on the US.

According to a report in the New York Daily News, health inspections at Trump-owned properties in Manhattan have turned up live mice and roaches. The worst offenses appeared to be at the president\u2019s eponymous tower in the city: City Department of Health inspectors visited the tower\u2019s cafe and grill on July 11, 2018 and found \u2018evidence of mice or live mice\u2019 in and around the kitchen, according to records that haven\u2019t previously been reported. The inspectors categorized the violation as \u2018critical.\u2019 The inspectors also deemed the restaurant \u2018not vermin proof\u2019 and said its \u2018conditions\u2019 are \u2018conducive to attracting vermin\u2019 and \u2018allowing vermin to exist.\u2019 Hold on, it gets worse. The report found that the Trump Tower restaurant has been cited for various health code violations every year since 2014, \u201cincluding sightings of \u2018live roaches\u2019 in 2016 and \u2018filth flies\u2019 in 2017\u201d. A Trump Organization official told the newspaper that the infractions would be dealt with \u201cimmediately\u201d. If you have the stomach for it, read more here. Bernie Sanders has hired Faiz Shakir, a longtime Democratic Party operative, as his 2020 campaign manager. Shakir most recently served as the political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which has led many of the legal challenges against Donald Trump\u2019s administration on civil rights and other constitutional issues. His previous stints include serving as an aide to former Senate majority leader Harry Reid and then-House minority leader Nancy Pelosi. Shakir\u2019s experience spans Capitol Hill and progressive think tanks in Washington. He also informally worked on Sanders\u2019 2016 run. Activist Linda Sarsour, a Sanders surrogate in 2016, celebrated Shakir\u2019s appointment as the first time a Muslim American has been put in charge of a major US presidential campaign. Good grief. While defending a Republican state legislator facing allegations of sexual assault, the Tennessee House speaker, Glen Casada, said the women who came forward should simply leave after being ostracized in their community. \u201cIf it\u2019s important, and it is \u2014 it\u2019d be important to me if I was raped, I would move,\u201d Casada said. \u201cAnd hell would have no fury.\u201d Casada was confronted in a video, published on a liberal website, about his support for David Byrd, a state representative in Tennessee who has been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple former students. Three women came forward to allege that Byrd sexually assaulted them the 1980s, when they were teenagers playing on the high school basketball team he coached at the time. Despite calls for Byrd to resign, Casada appointed him to chair the state House\u2019s education committee. Asked if he believed Byrd\u2019s accusers, Casada said: \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re lying. I think they\u2019re believing something that\u2019s not true.\u201d Trump had this to say at the White House when asked about Bernie Sanders making a second run for the presidency: \u201cPersonally, I think he missed his time,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I like Bernie.\u201d \u201cHe is one person that \u2013 on trade, he sort of would agree on trade. The problem is he doesn\u2019t know what to do about it.\u201d Trump went on to say Sanders was \u201cnot treated with respect\u201d by Hillary Clinton while insisting he would prevail in his own bid to be re-elected to the White House. \u201cI wish Bernie well, it will be interesting to see how he does,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think what happened to Bernie Sanders four years ago was quite sad.\u201d Update to the NYT report mentioned further down below: Donald Trump has denied making any requests of acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker with respect to a federal investigation into hush money payments to silence women. \u201cNo, not at all, I don\u2019t know who gave you that. Just more fake news,\u201d the president told reporters at the White House. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fake news out there. No I didn\u2019t.\u201d Trump added that Whitaker was a \u201cstraight shooter\u201d and praised his testimony on Capitol Hill from two weeks ago. \u201cHe\u2019s a very fine man and he should be given a lot of thanks by our nation.\u201d Trump also commented on his upcoming summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The president said while denuclearization remains the overall goal, he was confident at the pace of talks. \u201cI\u2019m in no rush,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI have no pressing time schedule. I really believe that North Korea can be a tremendous economic power when this is solved.\u201d Trump did add, however, that if Pyongyang resumed nuclear testing, his calculus might change. Speaking of investigations, it appears the FBI had a backup plan to ensure the protection of evidence collected in the Trump-Russia inquiry. The Associated Press reports that the plan was created after the firing of then FBI director James Comey, who was overseeing the investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow: The plan was crafted in the chaotic days after Comey was fired, when the FBI began investigating whether President Donald Trump had obstructed justice and whether he might be, wittingly or not, in league with the Russians. The goal was to ensure that the information collected under the investigations, which included probes of Trump associates and possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign, would survive the firings or reassignments of top law enforcement officials. Those officials included special counsel Robert Mueller, who was appointed eight days after Trump fired Comey in May 2017. Andrew McCabe, who became acting director after Comey was fired, asked investigators to develop a plan to ensure evidence would be protected, said the person, who was not authorized to talk about those discussions publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity to the Associated Press. A plan was then created, according to the person, who would not provide specifics. A second person familiar with the talks, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, also said the FBI discussed preserving evidence so that it would outlast any firing or effort to stymie the investigation. As I mentioned earlier, McCabe is currently causing quite the stir with revelations from his new book, The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump. Quite the literal book title, it seems! This one is quite the doozy from the New York Times: As federal prosecutors in Manhattan gathered evidence late last year about President Trump\u2019s role in silencing women with hush payments during the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump called Matthew G. Whitaker, his newly installed attorney general, with a question. He asked whether Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York and a Trump ally, could be put in charge of the widening investigation, according to several American officials with direct knowledge of the call. Mr. Whitaker, who had privately told associates that part of his role at the Justice Department was to \u201cjump on a grenade\u201d for the president, knew he could not put Mr. Berman in charge, since Mr. Berman had already recused himself from the investigation. The president soon soured on Mr. Whitaker, as he often does with his aides, and complained about his inability to pull levers at the Justice Department that could make the president\u2019s many legal problems go away. Allow me to refresh your memory... At least two women were paid six figures in hush money in 2016 to prevent them from speaking about their alleged affairs with Trump: one was adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who was paid $130,000 by Trump\u2019s former attorney Michael Cohen in exchange for her silence; the other was former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who received $150,000 from the National Enquirer, the tabloid owned by a close friend of Trump\u2019s, for exclusive rights to her story that was then never published in a practice known as \u2018catch-and-kill\u2019. These payments are under investigation by prosecutors in the southern district of New York, which is also examining what Trump knew about them. Cohen, who struck a plea deal with federal investigators, has already said Trump knew about both payments. After firing attorney general Jeff Sessions in November, Trump installed Justice Department official Matthew Whitaker as the acting AG -- bypassing the chain of command and inviting questions over the legality of Whitaker\u2019s appointment. Whitaker had previously been critical of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia and is widely regarded as a loyalist. This latest report now essentially suggests that Trump directly asked Whitaker to put another loyalist in charge of an investigation into the president himself. (It appears Whitaker declined to do so.) This is also notable because earlier this month, Whitaker testified before Congress and said, under oath, that he never discussed the Russia investigation with the president. He noticeably would not say if he had discussed the inquiry being led by the SDNY: The hush money payments are, of course, a separate investigation from Mueller\u2019s -- but there is some overlap in the key players, and that Trump was trying to get Whitaker to make moves in his favor doesn\u2019t exactly give credence to the notion that he avoided bringing up the Russia inquiry with the acting AG. You get all that? Donald Trump\u2019s administration has launched a global campaign aimed at ending the criminalization of homosexuality, according to a new report. From NBC News: U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, the highest-profile openly gay person in the Trump administration, is leading the effort, which kicks off Tuesday evening in Berlin. The U.S. embassy is flying in LGBT activists from across Europe for a strategy dinner to plan to push for decriminalization in places that still outlaw homosexuality \u2014 mostly concentrated in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean. Although the decriminalization strategy is still being hashed out, officials say it\u2019s likely to include working with global organizations like the United Nations, the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as other countries whose laws already allow for gay rights. Other U.S. embassies and diplomatic posts throughout Europe, including the U.S. Mission to the E.U., are involved, as is the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Narrowly focused on criminalization, rather than broader LGBT issues like same-sex marriage, the campaign was conceived partly in response to the recent reported execution by hanging of a young gay man in Iran, the Trump administration\u2019s top geopolitical foe. The move to focus the conversation on Iran could, however, cast a spotlight on other nations with which the Trump administration shares close ties, such as Saudi Arabia. The Saudi kingdom is among those to find homosexuality punishable by death; but Trump has continued to defend Riyadh amid human rights abuses that include the execution of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October. The Trump administration has also been criticized at home for rescinding protections enacted by Barack Obama that sought to weed out discrimination against the LGBTQ community. The president undid an Obama-era rule that had enforced workplace protections for LGBTQ people and banned transgender people from serving in the military. Some more on the donations pouring into Bernie Sanders 2020 via our stellar political correspondent, Lauren Gambino: In the first four hours after Bernie Sanders launched his campaign, he raised $1.2 million from 42,000 donors w/ sign ups and donations from all 50 states, according to a spokeswoman for his campaign. Senator Kamala Harris raises $1.5 from roughly 38,000 donors in the first 24-hours of her campaign, which was close to the amount Sanders raised in the first day of his 2016 presidential campaign. Sanders appears outpace to outraise Harris, which would be unsurprising given his sky-high name recognition and small-dollar fundraising prowess. His haul will be watched closes as a sign of whether his grassroots appeal is still strong. Small-dollar donations have become a litmus test of enthusiasm around a candidate, especially in such a crowded primary field in which voters have at least a dozen Democrats to support. Do you think there are enough Democrats already running for president? Well, too bad! Michael Bennet, a senator from Colorado, is heading to Iowa this week as he weighs whether or not to declare his candidacy for the White House. Iowa, as you might recall, is the first-in-the-nation caucus state and seen as a definitive test in the road to the nomination. Although not a household name, Bennet will likely try to appeal as a consensus-driven lawmaker who for 10 years has represented the purple state of Colorado. He was a co-sponsor of a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013 that would have granted a pathway to citizenship to the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US. The legislation died in the Republican-led House of Representatives after overwhelmingly passing the Senate. Not one to typically make headlines, Bennet\u2019s recent speech during the 35-day government shutdown went viral for its emotional unpacking of Republican obstructionism and tirade against Donald Trump and the border wall. You can revisit the 25-minute speech here: Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, has said reports that the White House planned to share nuclear technology information with Saudi Arabia renewed questions over on whose behalf the Trump administration is working. \u201cFor the last two years, our committee has been concerned about allegations that the president and his advisers have been beholden to or sought to advance interests other than those of the American people, and that U.S. policy is being adversely impacted,\u201d Schiff said in a statement, while adding the issues raised by the Saudi report \u201cgo to the heart of these concerns\u201d. \u201cWe rely on those in government to make decisions based on the best interests of the nation, not for personal financial gain or to advance foreign interests,\u201d Schiff added. \u201cIf the allegations are borne out, such an effort to enrich former business partners and benefit foreign governments is precisely the type of dangerous conflict of interest, serious compromise, and danger to national security that Congress has a duty to expose and root out.\u201d Trump has claimed he has \u201cno financial interests\u201d in Saudi Arabia. But that is not supported by the facts, and as a candidate in 2016 Trump instead boasted of his business dealings with the Saudis. In 2001, the Saudi government purchased the entire 45th floor of the Trump World Tower in New York City for $4.5m and has since paid roughly $5.7m in fees over time. And in 1991, Alwaleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family, bought a yacht repossessed by Trump for $20m. Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, shares a close rapport with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman, and has sought to strength the alliance between Washington and Riyadh. Democrats on the House oversight committee are calling for a \u2018full investigation\u2019 of whether the White House pursued a nuclear technology project with Saudi Arabia: Representative Elijah Cummings, the oversight committee chairman, has just issued a statement that whistleblowers tipped lawmakers off to the proposed venture: The whistleblowers who came forward have expressed significant concerns about the potential procedural and legal violations connected with rushing through a plan to transfer nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia. They have warned of conflicts of interest among top White House advisers that could implicate federal criminal statutes. They have also warned about a working environment inside the White House marked by chaos, dysfunction, and backbiting. And they have warned about political appointees ignoring directives from top ethics advisors at the White House who repeatedly and unsuccessfully ordered senior Trump Administration officials to halt their efforts. The Committee\u2019s investigation is particularly critical because the Administration\u2019s efforts to transfer sensitive U.S. nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia appear to be ongoing. On February 12, 2019, the President met with nuclear power developers at the White House about sharing nuclear technology with countries in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia.\u201d Cummings also noted that the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, is poised to embark on a tour of Middle Eastern capitals, including Riyadh, next week \u201cto discuss the economic portion of the Administration\u2019s Middle East peace plan\u201d. JUST IN: House Democrats have launched an inquiry into an alleged push by Donald Trump\u2019s administration to share nuclear power technology with Saudi Arabia. The latest via the Associated Press: A new congressional report says senior White House officials pushed a project to share nuclear power technology with Saudi Arabia despite the objections of ethics and national security officials. The Democrat-led House oversight committee launched an investigation Tuesday into the claims. The committee says whistleblowers within the Trump administration raised concerns about \u201cabnormal acts\u201d within the White House to support the proposal to build dozens of nuclear reactors across the Middle Eastern kingdom. The investigation comes as lawmakers from both parties have raised concerns that Saudi Arabia could develop nuclear weapons if the US technology is transferred without proper safeguards. The White House didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. More than six in 10 Americans disapprove of Donald Trump\u2019s decision to declare a national emergency at the US-Mexico border, according to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released on Tuesday. Nearly 60% of respondents also said they did not believe there was an emergency at the southern border and backed a legal challenge against Trump\u2019s move. The president issued a national emergency declaration last Thursday after threatening to do so for months amid an impasse over funding for the US government. Trump made his plans official as members of Congress reached a bipartisan deal to avert another government shutdown that did not include funding for his promised border wall. The action immediately drew backlash as a misuse of presidential powers, with even many Republicans on Capitol Hill criticizing Trump\u2019s step. Democrats meanwhile vowed to challenge Trump in the courts, while also stating they would bring up a resolution for a vote that would terminate the national emergency. \u201cAll things related to the declaring of a national emergency, the president is striking out in the court of public opinion,\u201d said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, one of the poll\u2019s conductors. \u201cHe\u2019s maintaining his base and little else.\u201d Well, it certainly looks like there are lots of Americans out there who are still feeling the Bern ... So Donald Trump is suggesting the Washington Post factchecker only applies to Democrats ... or something. I think the president is trying to say the only people who get factchecked are him and Republicans, except he kind of also said they\u2019re the ones with the \u2018fake\u2019 facts. As we are all well aware, Trump isn\u2019t exactly the most eloquent or even coherent with his words ... In any case, the source of his ire is likely this latest update via the Washington Post factchecker: \u201cIn 759 days, President Trump has made 8,718 false or misleading claims.\u201d But who\u2019s keeping track really? Nothing gets in RBG\u2019s way ... not even cancer! As Bernie Sanders makes his 2020 presidential bid official, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is meanwhile cautioning voters about the \u201cradical left\u201d. Schultz, who is contemplating an independent run for president in 2020, penned a Medium post on Tuesday reiterating his assertion that the Democratic party was becoming too liberal for its own good. \u201cThe stakes are too high to cross our fingers and hope the Democratic party nominates a moderate who can win over enough independents and disaffected Republicans, and even fellow Democrats, to defeat Trump next year,\u201d Schultz wrote. \u201cThat any opponent can oust Trump, no matter how far to the radical left they are, is a fallacy.\u201d Schultz has been criticized by Democrats for refusing to compete for the party\u2019s nomination and engage in a direct debate over centrist versus progressive ideas. Democrats have expressed concern that the Starbucks CEO would simply act as a spoiler by taking votes away from the eventual nominee as the party seeks to limit Trump\u2019s presidency to one term. Schultz acknowledged those fears in his post but insisted they were unfounded. \u201cI hear and respect this overriding concern, and have repeatedly promised that I will not be a spoiler,\u201d he said. \u201cI am committed to ensuring that I will do nothing to re-elect Donald Trump. I mean it.\u201d To say that early polling has not shown Schultz faring particularly well would be an understatement ... but the billionaire has continued to soak up media attention and make headlines. We interrupt the Bernie Sanders programming for some news via Andrew McCabe, the former acting attorney general ... In an interview with NBC\u2019s Today Show on Tuesday, McCabe said he briefed a bipartisan group of lawmakers in May of 2017 on an investigation the FBI was launching into Donald Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. \u201cThe purpose of the briefing was to let our congressional leadership know exactly what we had been doing,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cI told Congress what we had done ... no one objected. Not on legal grounds, not on constitutional grounds and not based on the facts.\u201d McCabe has set off a firestorm while promoting his new book, The Threat, which recounts remarkable anecdotes from the former acting FBI director\u2019s interactions with Trump and is inner circle. In the book, McCabe details discussions around invoking the 25th amendment \u2013 to remove the president from office \u2013 and even says deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein spoke with him about wearing a wire to secretly record Trump. Those revelations have invited an avalanche of criticism from the president and Republicans in Congress, who have claimed bias within the FBI and justice department against Trump. The president tweeted \u201cTreason!\u201d on Monday night while quoting from his friend and close ally Sean Hannity on Fox News. Asked by NBC host Savannah Guthrie if he was biased against the president, McCabe replied: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d \u201cI did my job. I worked on the facts and the law that were in front of us at the time,\u201d he said, while also dismissing Trump\u2019s attacks. \u201cI don\u2019t think really anybody takes those tweets by the president very seriously. I certainly don\u2019t at this point,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cHe\u2019s been attacking me and my family and lying about us for two years now so it\u2019s just really more of the same.\u201d Watch McCabe\u2019s interview here. The Republican National Committee also trotted out the \u201csocialist\u201d line against Bernie Sanders, moments after he launched his second bid for president. \u201cBernie Sanders is a self-avowed socialist who wants to double your taxes so the government can take over your health care,\u201d RNC spokesman Michael Ahrens said in a statement. \u201cThe vast majority of voters oppose his radical agenda, just like they are going to oppose all the 2020 Democrats who have rushed to embrace it.\u201d As mentioned earlier, Americans are not as averse to so-called \u201csocialism\u201d as Republicans might think. Be it single-payer healthcare or a wealth tax, polling shows such proposals are popular with the public. It is, however, true that most 2020 Democratic hopefuls have taken their cues from the movement Sanders launched in 2016. Several of his Senate colleagues, who are also running for president, have embraced the Medicare for All healthcare bill drafted by Sanders, including Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker. A number of Democratic contenders have also called for some variation of debt-free college tuition. But while Sanders can take some credit for pushing the Democratic Party more to the left, he also won\u2019t be able to draw as sharp a contrast as he did nearly four years ago with Hillary Clinton. That is, unless the party gravitates toward a more centrist candidate such as Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, who said far-reaching progressive plans such as Medicare for All and the Green New Deal were \u201caspirations\u201d. Former vice-president Joe Biden is also expected to make a decision on a possible presidential run soon, and will almost certainly pitch a more establishment-friendly vision. I wrote more on the internal debate within the Democratic party, and whether there\u2019s room for centrists, here. Need to reacquaint yourself with Bernie? We\u2019ve got you covered. Here\u2019s our video explaining how Sanders rose up in his political career and where he stands on the key issues: If anything, he gets points for consistency. You can watch the Bernie Sanders 2020 announcement video here: \u201cOur campaign is not only about defeating Donald Trump, the most dangerous president in modern American history,\u201d Sanders says in the video. Our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice. \u201cOur campaign is about taking on the special interests that dominate our economic and political life. I\u2019m talking about Wall Street, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the military industrial complex, the private prison industry, and the large multinational corporations that exert such an enormous influence over our lives. In other words, Sanders will build upon many of the same themes that formed the pillars of his insurgent campaign in 2016. Here\u2019s a breakdown via FiveThirtyEight on what his path to the Democratic nomination would look like. The reactions to Sanders\u2019 announcement are already pouring in ... Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign responded with the familiar \u201csocialist\u201d attack that Republicans used against Sanders in 2016. \u201cBernie Sanders has already won the debate in the Democrat primary, because every candidate is embracing his brand of socialism,\u201d Trump campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement. \u201cBut the American people will reject an agenda of sky-high tax rates, government-run health care and coddling dictators like those in Venezuela. Only President Trump will keep America free, prosperous and safe.\u201d In his State of the Union address earlier this month, Trump also sought to portray Democrats as socialists over economic policies that include single-payer healthcare, a guaranteed jobs program and debt-free college tuition. Those policies actually poll well with the American public. The real issue for Sanders is how he will fare in a Democratic field that has already been shaped in his mold. At least one progressive group that endorsed Sanders for president in 2016, Democracy for America, suggested the senator would have more work to do to distinguish himself in this race. \u201cBlessed with a diverse field of candidates committed to inclusive populist reforms, we\u2019re looking forward to seeing how Sanders and the movement behind him makes the case for \u2018political revolution\u2019 in a very different 2020 contest,\u201d the group\u2019s executive director, Yvette Simpson, said. \u201cTo win in 2020, Democrats need a leader committed to a visionary, progressive agenda who can win the enthusiastic support of the New American Majority of people of color and progressive white voters.\u201d \u201cWith Sanders joining Warren, Harris, Gillibrand and a number of others, we\u2019re more confident than ever that Democrats will find the candidate we need to defeat Trump and start delivering the kind of economic, social and racial justice needed to improve real people\u2019s lives.\u201d He\u2019s back. Bernie Sanders announced on Tuesday he will run for president in 2020. In an email to supporters, the Vermont senator said it was time to see through the progressive movement he energized in 2016. \u201cTogether, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cNow, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for.\u201d Whereas Sanders challenged establishment favorite Hillary Clinton for the Democratic party\u2019s nomination nearly four years ago, this time he joins a crowded and diverse 2020 field with no clear frontrunner. Others vying to claim the top of the Democratic ticket include Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. There are also a slew of lower-profile contenders, including the former San Antonio mayor and federal housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Pete Buttigieg, the young mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard. Read our full report on Sanders\u2019 announcement here and watch this space for more. Good morning! It\u2019s Sabrina Siddiqui, your blogger for the day, taking you through the late developments in Washington. We\u2019re already off with a bang, as Bernie Sanders has declared he will once again seek the presidency. The Vermont senator proved unsuccessful in challenging Hillary Clinton for the Democratic party\u2019s nomination in 2016, but will his fortunes change this go around? We\u2019ll break down the reaction to Sanders\u2019 announcement, what else is new with the emerging 2020 field, and of course the latest from the White House. Stay tuned!",

      "bodyText": "The Papua New Guinea prime minister, Peter O\u2019Neill, has requested a full briefing on the Paladin affair and said he would \u201cwelcome any investigation by Australian authorities\u201d. O\u2019Neill, speaking to local media overnight, said PNG had nothing to do with awarding the Paladin contract and gave no input to the Australian government\u2019s decision. \u201cWe welcome any investigation by Australian authorities in the manner in which the issued Paladin contract was awarded to an inexperienced and unknown company, but that is a matter for the Australian government,\u201d O\u2019Neill said, according to the Post-Courier. \u201cWe will request a full briefing on this matter from our Immigration Department who handles all operational issues with Australia.\u201d Meanwhile, Labor has referred the $423m of contracts controversially awarded to Paladin companies for security in Papua New Guinea to the auditor general, citing \u201csignificant concerns\u201d with the companies. After home affairs testimony in Senate estimates on Tuesday revealed the \u201curgent circumstances\u201d that gave rise to the closed tender process, Labor\u2019s immigration spokesman, Shayne Neumann, has written to the auditor general requesting an audit. Neumann said an urgent investigation was warranted given \u201cthe level of expenditure associated with these contracts, the government\u2019s poor track record, and the concerning reports and allegations related to the entities involved\u201d. Neumann noted that the department had approached Paladin Solutions Group \u201cdirectly\u201d and \u201cPaladin Solutions Group only\u201d offering a contract for provision of garrison support and welfare services in Papua New Guinea. That contract came after services totalling $89m were provided under letters of intent signed in September 2017. The contract was allowed under special measures provisions in commonwealth procurement rules, which departmental secretary Michael Pezzullo said was necessary because the PNG government revoked its offer to provide the services and major companies were not interested in tendering. Neumann noted Pezzullo\u2019s evidence that his \u201cvery strong preference would have been to have a long lead time, an open tender, a global search, assisted by specialised consultants and advisers\u201d. \u201cDespite this preference, a subsequent contract worth $333m awarded to Paladin Holdings Pte Ltd was signed on 28 February 2018 with no other providers considered \u2013 despite reports today indicating that other companies, such as Toll Holdings, were considering bidding,\u201d Neumann wrote. Neumann cited the Australian National Audit Office\u2019s 2017 report concluding that the department had \u201cfallen well short of effective contract management practice\u201d in garrison support and welfare services in Nauru and PNG. He said the report was a \u201cdamning indictment\u201d on the department that found contracts \u201cwere established in circumstances of great haste\u201d, the department \u201cdid not put in place effective mechanisms to manage the contracts\u201d and contract variations totalling more than $1bn were made \u201cwithout a documented assessment of value for money\u201d. \u201cLabor is acutely aware of the current government\u2019s abysmal management of Australian-funded regional processing centres and their failure to negotiate other third-country resettlement options, leaving vulnerable people languishing in indefinite detention.\u201d Paladin companies had little experience in providing garrison and security services in immigration detention, and the contracts have become more controversial after a series of reports in the Australian Financial Review about the firm, which until recently listed one of its business premises as a beach shack on Kangaroo Island. Refugees on Manus Island told Guardian Australia the security contractor was \u201cdoing nothing\u201d on the ground, while Greens senator Nick McKim has noted he was on Manus Island at the time of the closure of the detention centre, and services were not being provided. Hundreds of detainees on Manus Island remained in the closed facility without food, water or medical supplies for more than a fortnight. In a statement, the home affairs department said the Paladin Group was \u201ca global company which has delivered security and related services to a broad range of government and private sector clients across the Asia-Pacific region since 2007\u201d and had been operating in PNG through a local entity, Paladin Solutions PNG Ltd.",

      "bodyText": "The proportion of children in Britain living in poverty risks hitting a record high in the next few years as incomes stagnate and benefit cuts continue to bite, a report has warned. A study by the Resolution Foundation thinktank said UK households had experienced flatlining living standards due to a lack of economic and pay growth in the past two years. Average incomes will not rise materially over the next two years either, it said. The bleak forecast will hit lower-income families harder, according to the report, and child poverty could exceed previous highs reached in the early 1990s. Deprived families will bear the brunt of weak pay and benefit cuts, the report said. While weak productivity and pay freezes were holding back living standards for most people, government policy was also hitting more deprived groups. The report noted the final year of the benefit freeze, which will reduce working-age household incomes by \u00a31.5bn, will start in April, while the impact of the two-child limit on benefits will grow over the remainder of this parliament. This is having a direct impact on child poverty, said the report, which has been increasing continuously since 2011. It predicts that by 2023-24 the proportion of children living in relative poverty (after housing costs) is on course to hit 37% \u2013 exceeding the previous record high of 34% in the early 1990s.

He added: \u201cThe UK\u2019s current economic outlook is highly uncertain, and will hopefully surprise on the upside.

The report, The Living Standards Outlook 2019, combines data, the Office of Budgetary Responsibility\u2019s economic projections and the impact of current government policy to reach its findings. The report warns that by the end of parliament the majority of children in single-parent families or in larger families, with more than two children, could be living in relative poverty. \u201cThe good news is that child poverty is responsive to policy change \u2013 this means that if we act fast we can take action to reduce it \u2026 The government should also end the punitive, poverty-producing two child limit and benefit cap that break the link between children\u2019s needs and they support they get. It\u2019s only by reinvesting in struggling families that the government can avoid presiding over record levels of child poverty,\u201d said McGeehan. The Resolution Foundation says increasing wage growth by 1% (bringing it into line with the pre-crisis average of 4%) could treble the strength of income growth over the reminder of parliament. It also finds that were the UK to repeat the employment success of the last two years for the next two, bringing an extra 900,000 people into work, typical income growth over the next five years would increase to 2.6%. The foundation said while strengthening pay and employment was not directly within the government\u2019s short-term control, action to prevent child poverty hitting a record high should be a priority.

Experts have found the UK is languishing near the bottom of an international league table for a host of problems, including obesity, lack of exercise in children and the burden of chronic health issues \u2013 and in many cases the situation is getting worse. \u201cYoung people\u2019s health is not high enough up the policy agenda,\u201d said Ann Hagell, a co-author of the report from the Association for Young People\u2019s Health, which published it with the Nuffield Trust. Hagell said that was partly because the age group was largely seen as being fit and healthy, despite the report revealing almost 20% of 16- to 24-year-olds in the UK are living with a chronic health problem. Many services that benefit young people, including school nurses and sexual health services, have seen substantial cuts. Improving the health of young people today would not only produce benefits now, Hagell said, but would also reduce health costs in future. \u201cIf we don\u2019t really start to seriously invest in our 10- to 24-year-olds, then things are only going to get worse,\u201d she said, noting there had already been signs of a drop in life expectancy in the US and UK. The report looks at how the UK fares on 17 different indicators of the health and wellbeing of young people \u2013 ranging from mortality rates to the proportion of young people out of work or education \u2013 with the findings compared against up to 18 other high-income countries including the US, Australia and Japan. The figures are based on the most recent data, but not all are from the same year, or cover the same age spans. The UK does well on deaths from traffic accidents and mortality in general, with the latter showing the fifth-lowest rate for 10- to 19-year-olds of all 19 countries surveyed \u2013 although progress has stalled. Strikingly, the UK comes near the bottom of the pack for deaths from asthma among 10- to 24-year-olds, with the fourth-worst figure across all 19 countries and the worst death rate in Europe, with a figure double that of the next worst European country in the study. Recent work by others has found many asthma patients are not receiving basic care for the condition, and that asthma deaths in the UK are on the rise. In particular, concerns have been growing about the role of air pollution in asthma. The death of nine-year-old Ella Kissi-Debrah from London as a result of an asthma attack has been linked to illegal levels of pollutants, while doctors say they have been shocked at the number of cases of children ending up in hospital choking with asthma, apparently as a result of air pollution. The World Health Organization, meanwhile, has branded air pollution the \u201cnew tobacco\u201d in terms of its impact on public health, while experts say statistics showing it is behind 7 million early deaths a year are probably an underestimate. In the UK, air pollution is believed to be responsible for the deaths of about 40,000 people a year. The new study finds smoking, drinking and cannabis use among young Britons is middling compared with other countries, with some signs that use is falling. However, 15- to 19-year-olds in the UK have the worst rates of obesity of the European countries at 8.1% \u2013 with prevalence rising. \u201cObesity particularly is something that is influenced by the environment around you,\u201d said Hagell, noting that availability of fast-food and the cost of healthy alternatives played a role. The report comes a year after experts revealed that the UK was lagging behind similar countries on important health priorities for babies and young children, including breastfeeding and infant mortality, while progress in many areas, including vaccination, had stalled. Such conclusions are reflected in the emphasis put on health of children and young people in the recently released NHS long-term plan. While the authors of the new research admit comparing across countries has drawbacks, not least because of different societal pressures, they say it shows more needs to be done to improve and support the health of the 11.6 million people aged 10 to 24 in the UK. \u201cThe uncomfortable conclusion from the data is that our policies and health services are not performing to the same standard as those in other comparable nations, and we are letting our adolescents and young adults down,\u201d the authors write. \u201cIt is to our own discredit that this is happening at a time when more and more adolescents and young adults themselves are making better choices around their health-related behaviours.\u201d They say money should be pumped into public health initiatives \u2013 where cuts have been severe \u2013 while both services and doctors need to engage better with young people. Tackling poverty and inequality, they add, is also crucial to improving health: the UK was near the bottom of the pack for material deprivation and rates of young people out of work, training or education, while it has one of the biggest gaps in obesity between rich and poor. Prof Chris Griffiths, co-director of the Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research, said the findings were disappointing but not surprising and that urgent action was needed by the government and NHS to improve access to high-quality asthma care and education. \u201cTechnical advances may help, such as inhalers that electronically monitor and prompt adherence, and digital smartphone asthma action plans, but we need to deliver on the basics of good care,\u201d he said. Dr Lucinda Hiam from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said the stalling in improving mortality rates among young people was a \u201cred flashing warning sign of a society in trouble\u201d and was probably linked to austerity policies. \u201cThe deepening health crisis in the UK requires society-wide, political intervention,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government must act urgently.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 20 February 2019. The World Health Organization did not say statistics which showed air pollution was behind 7 million early deaths a year was probably an underestimate, as an earlier version suggested. It was other experts in this field who said that figure was likely an underestimate. This has been corrected.",

The chancellor, Philip Hammond, confirmed late on Tuesday that the government no longer intended to pursue alternative arrangements for the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which had been championed by cross-factional MPs including Eurosceptic Steve Baker and soft Brexiter Nicky Morgan. Instead, the prime minister is travelling to Brussels to meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, with a plan to secure legal assurances that the backstop would not permanently bind the UK into a customs union. She was forced to admit to Conservative MPs who met her on Tuesday night that the Irish backstop could not be replaced by the \u201cMalthouse compromise\u201d \u2013 proposals for a free trade agreement with as-yet-unknown technology to avoid customs checks on the Irish border. However, she stressed that this solution would still be examined in future to help solve the issue of customs arrangements at the Irish border.

Hammond hinted the vote could still come next week, saying that \u201cover the next few days, Members of Parliament need to think long and hard about the choice before them.\u201d The Malthouse compromise was named after the housing minister, Kit Malthouse, who helped draft it as an attempt to find a Brexit deal the warring sides of the Tory party could back. The most hardline Eurosceptics have repeatedly said they will only support May\u2019s deal if the compromise is written into the EU withdrawal agreement to replace the backstop \u2013 the mechanism that would keep the UK in a customs union if there were no solution to the Irish border. However, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker insisted the Malthouse agreement was \u201cstill live and kicking\u201d and said they looked forward to further developments. No 10 appears to be placing its hopes for breaking the deadlock with the EU on legal assurances that the Irish backstop potentially binding the UK into a customs union would not be permanent. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, held talks on Monday with the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier. He is understood to have warned Barnier that the consequence of the deal not passing would result either in a no-deal or in parliament taking control of events, adding extra uncertainty and difficulty to the UK-EU negotiations. If May and Juncker can agree a possible way forward on Wednesday night, officials will then start work on the technical and legal practicalities. The goal is for Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, to be able to change his legal advice to the government, which currently states that the backstop could mean a permanent customs union. Cox is expected to give a speech later this week setting out his thinking. At a press conference in Stuttgart on Tuesday, Juncker played down expectations over his meeting with May. He said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t enough movement for me to be able to expect this to be a discussion with a concrete outcome.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what Mrs May will communicate to me tomorrow,\u201d he said, adding that he was unsure what \u201cour British friends would actually like to have\u201d. The gap between the expectations in parliament and the reality of the talks in Brussels was made clear on Tuesday by the European commission\u2019s chief spokesman ahead of May\u2019s visit. Asked about Barnier\u2019s two-hour meeting with Barclay and Cox on Monday, the spokesman said: \u201cWe cannot accept a time limit to the backstop or a unilateral exit clause and further talks will be held this week to see whether a way through can be found that could gain the broadest possible support in the UK parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European council.\u201d EU sources expressed frustration that they were having to \u201cre-educate\u201d Cox, who is new to the talks, about the lack of realism in the central demands made by May. Sources said Barnier and his deputy, Sabine Weyand, had been \u201cforensic\u201d in their dismantling of the Malthouse compromise on Monday. Barnier told Barclay that suspending EU law on the border was not a viable solution to the problem. Weyand later privately lamented that the EU was having to repeat arguments to Cox first made in August 2017. Officials are looking at translating into legal text the previous commitments by Juncker, and his European council counterpart, Donald Tusk, about the temporary nature of the backstop, and their intention to work on a technological solution to supercede the backstop in the future. But officials are sceptical that such a move would satisfy the Democratic Unionist party or the Tory Brexiters, who had been led to believe the withdrawal agreement would be reopened in order to win their support. With the negotiations at an impasse, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is expected to appeal to Brussels to help the UK come up with a solution during a visit to Berlin. Between talks with the German foreign and finance ministers, Heiko Maas and Peter Altmaier, Hunt is expected to warn that failure to ratify the withdrawal agreement will be \u201cdeeply damaging, economically and politically\u201d. \u201cIn the vital weeks ahead, standing back and hoping that Brexit solves itself will not be enough\u201d, Hunt will say. \u201cThe stakes are just too high: we must all do what we can to ensure such a deal is reached. At this momentous time, a heavy responsibility falls upon all of us. We do not want historians in the future to puzzle over our actions and ask themselves how it was that Europe failed to achieve an amicable change in its relationship with Britain \u2013 a country that is not simply a partner but a friend and ally in every possible sense.\u201d With time running out, cabinet was also updated on the option of a no-deal Brexit if May cannot get her withdrawal agreement approved by parliament. One cabinet source said only Liz Truss, the secretary to the Treasury, spoke up emphatically in favour of keeping no deal as a negotiating option. \u201cI can\u2019t understand how a No 2 at the Treasury could still countenance keeping that on the table,\u201d the cabinet source said, but added that the general mood in the room had noticeably turned against no deal as a negotiating tactic.",
