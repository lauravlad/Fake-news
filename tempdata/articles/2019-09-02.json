They can see that we want a deal. </p> \n   <p>They can see that we have a clear vision for our future relationship with the EU - something that has perhaps not always been the case. </p> \n   <p>And they can see that we are utterly determined to strengthen our position by getting ready to come out regardless, come what may.</p> \n   <p>But if there is one thing that can hold us back in these talks it is the sense in Brussels that MPs may find some way to cancel the referendum.</p> \n   <p>Or that tomorrow MPs will vote \u2013 with Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 for yet another pointless delay.

She explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our mission here is to to prevent no deal. We do want a general election ... Our mission is very clear, and it is about preventing no deal. If that means that a general election cannot happen at that particular point, then stopping no deal must come first ... This isn\u2019t for the benefit of the Labour party.

But more likely having a general election becomes one of the few ways that we are able to prevent no deal. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Labour says it is confident there is a majority for the planned bill designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Assuming that the bill passes, and assuming that it is robust enough to do what it is meant to do, in those circumstances the Labour objection to an election after 31 October might no longer apply.</p> \n  <p>Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the easiest way to get around the rule saying the next election should not take place until 2022 (five years after the last one) would be for two-thirds of MPs to vote for an early election. Alternatively, the government could lose a vote of no confidence, and an election would take place if no alternative government won a confidence vote within 14 days.</p> \n  <p>Alternatively, the government could pass a new bill to amend the FTPA to allow an early election.</p> \n  <p>But, given that Boris Johnson only has a majority of one, and some Tories oppose a no-deal Brexit, he would not be able to use any of these mechanisms to call an early election without assistance from Labour.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73aae38e0e7b4352d887435f287db918ee68f9ea\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73aae38e0e7b4352d887435f287db918ee68f9ea/0_111_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jenny Chapman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jenny Chapman</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-02T13:22:43.913Z\">at 2.22pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d6d09388f081c5d7489e450\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-02T12:22:25.294Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sturgeon says SNP would back early election before 31 October</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon,</strong> Scotland\u2019s first minister, says the SNP would back an early election - provided it took place before 31 October.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NicolaSturgeon/status/1168492254866137088\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As talk of a General Election mounts, I say \u2018bring it on\u2019...but it must be before Oct 31.

Corbyn said Labour wanted MPs to pass legislation designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, and that he wanted a general election to follow. But he would not say what he would do if the legislation failed, or if Johnson tried to call a general election before the bill became law, or if Johnson proposed an election before 31 October. For an election to take place under the Fixed-Terms Parliaments Act, Labour would almost certainly have to vote in favour, or at least abstain. In the past No 10 sources have hinted that Johnson might try to trigger a general election to take place after the UK leaves the EU on 31 October \u2013 a proposal that Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, indicated yesterday Labour would find impossible to support. But Labour would find it much harder to oppose any election scheduled for before 31 October. </li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-02T11:19:08.909Z\">at 12.19pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d6cf1008f081c5d7489e355\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-02T10:44:44.585Z\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: What would you say to Labour leave supporters?</em><br></p> \n  <p>Corbyn says there were leave voters and remain voters at the weekend protests.

I cannot find a text of it online yet, but it will probably appear <a href=\"https://institute.global/\">on his foundation\u2019s website</a> at some point.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Blair said Boris Johnson wanted an early election because it would be a \u201ctrap\u201d for Labour.</strong> Rather than voting for an early election, MPs should insist on a referendum, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If parliament cannot agree, then the right way to consult the people is not through a general election but through a referendum.</p> \n   <p>That means, as MPs from different parties have agreed, that there should not be a motion of no confidence but rather legislation preventing no deal.</p> \n   <p>Should the government seek an election, it should be refused in favour of a referendum.</p> \n   <p>It is counterintuitive for opposition parties to refuse an election. But in this exceptional case, it is vital they do so as a matter of principle, until Brexit is resolved.</p> \n   <p>Brexit is an issue which stands on its own, was originally decided on its own and should be reconsidered on its own.</p> \n   <p>The Brexiteers are laying a trap, to seem as if pushed into an election, whilst actively preparing for one.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Blair said Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s unpopularity would make an election more appealing to Johnson.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[The Brexiters] know there are two issues in British politics not one: Brexit; and the Corbyn leadership.</p> \n   <p>It is the interplay between these two issues that has shaped and defined British politics over the past 3-4 years.</p> \n   <p>Boris Johnson knows that if no-deal Brexit stands on its own as a proposition, it might well fail. But if he mixes up the Brexit question with the Corbyn question in a general election, he could succeed, despite a majority being against a no-deal Brexit, because some may fear a Corbyn premiership more.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"02ebc598-cde3-4d9e-aee4-4b5970b83c9f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MJ6KYLYRYKc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Blair acknowledged that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit as an alternative might also make some people more likely than otherwise to vote for Corbyn. But he said that Corbyn should recognise an election as \u201cthe elephant trap it is\u201d and he said Corbyn had acted \u201cresponsibly\u201d in making legislation to rule out no deal a priority this week, not a confidence vote. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Leave aside what is fair or unfair: no opposition leader or party with these poll ratings has won an election.</p> \n   <p>The 2017 result has inoculated the Labour party against a realistic assessment of where it stands. </p> \n   <p>To be sure, an election is a risk for the Tories. Each Tory candidate will have to sign up to no deal. The Brexit party is a one man unpredictable band. Scotland will be very tough.</p> \n   <p>But my bet is the Brexit party will collapse to them.</p> \n   <p>The Labour party at present will struggle; a resurgent Lib Dems will do well, but not well enough to govern. The opposition vote will split. Under our system that delivers a comfortable Tory majority.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Blair suggested he was surprised that Johnson did not realise people would question the legitimacy of a no-deal Brexit.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Does no one presently in government, particularly those cabinet members who used to protest against the irresponsibility of such a course, understand the consequence of doing this in circumstances where a large part of the country will regard it as illegitimate?</p> \n   <p>Democracy depends on a shared sense of legitimacy in decision making.</p> \n   <p>Legitimacy is not the same as agreement with government. Governments do things people dislike. But outside of the political fringes, most people accept their right to do them.</p> \n   <p>This is now a crisis of legitimacy.</p> \n   <p>No one in government even pretends to address these anxieties.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said Brexit was difficult to resolve because there were at least three different versions of it.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Not once have our nation\u2019s leadership explained to the public why Brexit has been so difficult to resolve, which is because there are at least three different versions of it \u2013 hard, soft and no-deal and all are vastly different in their implications.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the Brexit debate was so bitter because it was about values and identity, and not just about the EU.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Brexit has become so bitter because Brexit is not simply about a decision to leave the EU. It is about culture, identity, values, generation. The essence is not about trade. It is about who we are as a nation in the 21st century.</p> \n   <p>Normally questions of identity play out over time, by evolution, or by staggered points of development in successive elections. But the holding of the referendum turned this into a moment of revolution.</p> \n   <p>It forced us to confront a division, perhaps better unconfronted.</p> \n   <p>On the one side are those who feel Britain as they know it is being cast aside, the things they like about Britain disappearing, and in their place, petty political correctness, bureaucratic obsessions, magnified and exemplified by Europe, and, above all, obedience to the god of multi-culturalism at the expense of \u2018our own culture\u2019 ...</p> \n   <p>Those of us on the other side ... we look at Europe today and see 70 years of peace and relative stability. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He suggested the second world war was casting \u201ca long shadow over the British psyche\u201d which was not helpful</strong>:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[Pro-Brexit] Britain imagines a parallel with the second world war, a period of our history which, rightly, makes us proud. Read the speeches of the Brexiteers and they are replete with references to this feat of glory.</p> \n   <p>But it casts a long shadow over the British psyche. It creates a longing to live the moment again, to see each new circumstance through the lens of its narrative, a life and death struggle between us and those who would harm us, where against all odds we triumph, a series of Darkest Hours from which we emerge to the sunlit uplands.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5b6e87b3475fed7b88f7e2af399f7425d1ecbac\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5b6e87b3475fed7b88f7e2af399f7425d1ecbac/0_85_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Blair speaking at the Institute for Government this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Blair speaking at the Institute for Government this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-02T12:12:55.529Z\">at 1.12pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d6cdc8c8f081c5d7489e283\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-02T09:14:25.554Z\">10.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It is not just Tory MPs planning to support the legislation intended to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October who are criticising Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to threaten rebels with the withdrawal of the whip.

The usual operational isn\u2019t particularly happening. It does seem to me that they\u2019re almost goading people into voting against the government because I think their strategy, to be honest, is to lose this week and then seek a general election, having removed those of use who are not against Brexit, not against leaving the European Union, but believe we should do so with a deal.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Gauke\u2019s analysis seems very reasonable, and it is in line with what many commentators are saying (for example, see <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49546224\">this blogpost</a> from the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, and <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-09-01/an-election-is-coming-and-soon-writes-robert-peston/\">this one</a> from Robert Peston, her opposite number at ITV), but of course under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act calling an election is no longer straightforward.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now, here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: The prime minister will seek to hold a general election on 14 October if Parliament votes to hand control of the legislative timetable to the opposition on Tuesday, a government source said. Boris Johnson claimed Brussels would not engage until the possibility of legislation blocking a no-deal Brexit or a reversal of the whole process was removed and called for MPs to back him. He sought to ramp up the pressure on those Tory MPs minded not to do so as the Commons prepares to debate legislation designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit. MPs were left in no doubt that Tuesday\u2019s vote would be treated as a confidence vote by No 10 and the consequences for voting against Downing Street would be withdrawal of the whip. The work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, was one of those who urged Johnson not to go down that road. In an address outside Downing Street, Johnson indicated he would refuse to ask Brussels for a delay to Brexit, even if a law was passed requiring him to do so. Johnson said there were \u201cno circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on 31 October - no ifs or buts\u201d. That was despite plans to vote tomorrow on whether or not to legally bind him to such a course of action, should he fail to convince Parliament to back either a withdrawal agreement or a no-deal Brexit. Ministers have previously refused to rule out the government ignoring the rule of law on the issue. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, insisted he would be ready for a general election. Earlier in the day, he had said he would back calling an early vote in any circumstances. However, Jenny Chapman \u2013 a shadow Brexit minister \u2013 later said Labour would not support a vote that took place after a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, committed her party to backing any vote before that date too. The former chancellor, Philip Hammond, challenged the prime minister to set out details of his plan to negotiate an alternative to the backstop. There have been reports that, despite Johnson claiming to have made progress, officials on the continent believe little or nothing has been achieved. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, also said British proposals were not satisfactory. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Peter Walker and Jessica Elgot have the full story: Update: A final piece of breaking news emerged shortly after I posted this summary. Hammond\u2019s local Conservative Association says it has reselected him as its candidate: The self-styled \u201cyellow-vest\u201d protester, James Goddard, has been arrested outside a Labour rally in Salford where Jeremy Corbyn spoke, amid clashes between the Labour leader\u2019s supporters and rightwing activists. My colleague, Lucinda Campbell, reports that Goddard was arrested and taken into custody after a car was obstructed leaving the venue in Salford\u2019s Media City. A Greater Manchester police spokesman said: Shortly before 8pm on Monday 2 September 2019, police arrested a 30-year-old man on suspicion of breach of the peace. The arrest was made following the conclusion of an event being held at the Lowry Theatre, Salford. The man remains in custody for questioning. About 1,400 people attended the event at the Lowry Lyric Theatre that featured speeches from Corbyn and the Labour frontbenchers John McDonnell, Diane Abbott, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Angela Rayner. Several protesters, both men and women dressed in black, bore British and English flags. One of the men said: \u201cWe voted to leave on 23 June, accept that you lost.\u201d The crowd chanted back, \u201cNazi scum off our streets\u201d, \u201cSay no to fascism\u201d and repeatedly sang in solidarity, \u201cOh, Jeremy Corbyn\u201d, applauding as police eventually arrested 30-year-old Goddard. He remains in custody on suspicion of breach of peace. Graham Brady, the former chair of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, has claimed that Boris Johnson is \u201cvery keen\u201d to avoid a general election. Brady said the prime minister had given a \u201cvery good speech\u201d to his party colleagues in Downing Street before he addressed the nation outside. Speaking afterwards, Brady said Johnson had \u201cset a very clear course\u201d of things he wanted to achieve domestically, as well as trying to get a Brexit deal. He said he\u2019s very keen not to have an election. I think it\u2019s important we get on and make some progress with both the crucial issue of our exit from the European Union but there are many many other important things to do. He talked about the funding for schools, the new hospital refurbishments, many, many challenges we need to get on with. At around the same time as Johnson was addressing the nation, a senior government source was briefing journalists on the date the prime minister would seek to hold a general election, should MPs vote against him tomorrow. Opponents have accused Johnson of \u201cdoing everything he can to bring about an election, while claiming it\u2019s the last thing he wants\u201d. This evening, some MPs have been making clear their resolve remains strong (see: 8.19pm). BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham has a little more on the numbers expected to rebel: Not expected to vote against the government is the Brexit-supporting Labour MP, Kate Hoey: Meanwhile, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, has said the focus should be on Brexit, rather than a potential general election. What we should be concentrating on is getting a deal to leave the European Union in an orderly fashion. But if we are in the realms of a general election, we will of course stand on our record of delivery through the confidence and supply [deal], the fact we have delivered a billion pounds here to the people of Northern Ireland and indeed are building on now, speaking to the Chancellor around the spending round which is coming on Wednesday, so we\u2019ll stand on a record of delivery, we\u2019ll stand on a record of standing four-square for the union. Political parties in Northern Ireland cannot be afraid of elections and we are not afraid of elections, but we don\u2019t believe it is the right time because what we should be concentrating on is getting a deal. A no-deal Brexit would mean \u201cdamage and danger\u201d to the peace process in Northern Ireland, Corbyn has said. He also spoke about the challenges of climate change and the impact of the government\u2019s austerity measures. Whenever this campaign begins, and you never know it might be almost upon us, we know what we\u2019ve got to do. We\u2019ve got to be united as a party and a movement, united in our determination to prevent a no-deal Brexit, for ensuring we come to an agreement in the future but deal with the injustice and the inequalities that exist in Britain and unite people around our programme which is one of delivering the houses, the jobs, the schools, the hospitals and above all that sense of hope in our community. With threats of withdrawal of the whip being made against those Tory MPs who refuse to back the government over a no-deal Brexit tomorrow, this will be an night of introspection for many. Their resolve appears to be holding, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports: Corbyn has accused Johnson of \u201cthreatening people with a no-deal Brexit if he doesn\u2019t get his way in parliament\u201d. I know people voted both ways in the referendum, obviously. I know people have different views about these things. obviously. But I simply say this: People didn\u2019t vote to lose their jobs, didn\u2019t vote to see our environmental standards, workers\u2019 rights, consumer protections ripped up. They voted because they were angry about many things and they voted as they did to try and protect themselves as best they could. Our purpose is to challenge this government on a no-deal Brexit, our purpose is to try to protect jobs and living standards, try to ensure that this country doesn\u2019t run headlong into the arms of Donald Trump and a trade deal with the United States. And he has added: The idea that Donald Trump and Boris Johnson are some kind of populist icons on behalf of the poorest and most downtrodden people actually is something beyond a misnomer. There is wealth funding these parties, there is wealth looking after itself and there is wealth that wants a no-deal Brexit, that the hedge funds might prosper as a result. We will challenge them in parliament tomorrow and we will continue that challenge. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has been addressing the party\u2019s rally in Salford this evening. He has told supporters: I don\u2019t know about you, but at 6pm I was watching on the television and waiting with great expectation. The expectation was possibly overrated, it was the BBC commentary awaiting the arrival of the speaker to a podium outside Downing Street and it was a bit like Test Match Special on a wet day when there is no cricket but nevertheless they talk and talk and talk. The statement itself didn\u2019t amount to very much, in fact it amounted to almost nothing at all except there was quite a powerful subliminal message there. As with the years of Theresa May, it\u2019s all about the Tory party. It\u2019s the Tory party talking to the Tory party about the Tory party and the Tory party\u2019s opportunities for the future. Well I simply say this: Tories can talk to each other about their party, they can talk to each other about their chances, or otherwise, of survival, and all the tax cuts they\u2019ll give to the rich and all the other things that they do. We, on the other hand, are out there with the people trying to bring about social justice and equality in our society. Adam Wagner, a human rights lawyer who writes for the Guardian, is among those to point out that many Jewish people would be unable to vote if a general election was called for 14 October: Speaking to the cabinet earlier, Boris Johnson said EU leaders had clarity on the UK\u2019s position but that he believed negotiations were being \u201cheld back\u201d because Brussels believed parliament would find a way to stop a no-deal scenario or cancel Brexit altogether. A senior government official said: The impression he was getting from EU leaders was that they will not engage until the prospect of parliament cancelling the referendum was ended. MPs are effectively considering tomorrow whether to hand control of the negotiations to Jeremy Corbyn. That would be shooting ourselves in the foot and, if Conservative MPs help him to make no deal illegal tomorrow and therefore create another pointless delay, the government\u2019s negotiating position will be wrecked. What they are effectively voting for is to hold a rapid election. And they will have to explain what they are doing. On Tuesday, if opposition MPs vote to take control of parliamentary business, Tory MPs have been told they will have the whip withdrawn because the government sees that as an effective confidence motion. Senior rebel Tories and Labour MPs are sceptical Johnson would stick to his word and call an election before 31 October, though government sources ruled out any chance of changing the date after MPs had voted. The source said: A PM would need to be in place before [the] European council [meeting] on 17 October. If you are to have any chance of securing a deal, you must have an election before then and the PM has been very clear he wants to get a deal. I know there has been speculation but that is not our mind, it is nowhere near our thinking. We can rule out the idea of any election taking place after the European council [meeting]. Downing Street is understood to be confident it can win a vote for a general election, though it is still unclear if it could achieve a two-thirds majority if a significant number of Tory and Labour MPs refuse to back the election with no guarantees that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided. A No 10 source said: Jeremy Corbyn has been very explicit he will back a general election no matter what. The PM would of course expect Conservative MPs to vote for it. The pro-remain Best for Britain campaign has attacked the prime minister after his address outside No 10 this evening. The Labour MP, David Lammy, who supports the campaign, has said: The prime minister has made this statement purely because his attempt to bully those Conservative MPs who have been standing up to him has failed. They\u2019ve chosen country over party. Tomorrow, MPs from across the House of Commons will get the ball rolling to stop a disastrous no-deal Brexit. There\u2019s no mandate for no-deal and Boris Johnson knows this. He will fail. Its chief executive, Naomi Smith, added: Boris Johnson said MPs trying to get an extension beyond 31 October were \u2018chopping the legs out from under the UK position\u2019. The brutal truth is that Johnson and his cabal of no-deal zealots are chopping the legs from underneath UK democracy. They must be stopped, no-deal must be stopped, Brexit must be stopped \u2013 in Johnson\u2019s own words, no ifs, no buts. Johnson\u2019s speech was being drowned out by protesters at the gates of Downing Street \u2013 let him be in no doubt that those voices are only going to get louder. The US will play a constructive role in a Brexit that \u201cencourages stability\u201d, its vice-president, Mike Pence, has said. Speaking at a joint press conference with Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, after touching down in the nation, he said: We will continue to work closely with our partners in Ireland and the United Kingdom to support a Brexit plan that encourages stability and also one which keeps the strong foundation forged by the Good Friday agreement. We understand these are complex issues. Pence confirmed he would be meeting Boris Johnson in the next few days and that \u201cbetter understanding\u201d the Northern Ireland issues would help promote a deal. I will be in the UK meeting with Prime Minister Boris Johnson in just a few days but I think the opportunity to better understand Ireland\u2019s perspective and unique needs, particularly with regard to the northern border, will make us even better equipped to hopefully play a constructive role that when Brexit occurs, it will occur in a way that reflects stability and addresses the unique relationship between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. He declined to answer a question over whether the US would commit to a trade deal with the UK if it damaged the peace process in Northern Ireland. In his address outside No 10 about an hour ago, Johnson called on MPs to vote with the government tomorrow, hinting that not doing so would make an election more likely. He said: We will not accept any attempt to go back on our promises or scrub that referendum. Armed and fortified with that conviction, I believe we will get a deal at that crucial summit in October; a deal that parliament will certainly be able to scrutinise. And, in the meantime, let our negotiators get on with their work without that sword of Damocles over their necks. And without an election, which I don\u2019t want and you don\u2019t want. The prime minister will ask MPs to back a general election for 14 October should a cross-party rebel alliance vote to take control of parliament tomorrow, according to a government source. Boris Johnson is set to treat a vote by opposition MPs to take control of the legislative agenda as an effective confidence vote. A government motion is set to be tabled by the government for a snap general election if rebels are successful in passing a motion to take control of the order paper. There would then be a vote on Wednesday on a new general election under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, which requires a two-thirds majority. The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, has told the Labour rally: It\u2019s not about Brexit, it\u2019s about taking away the voices of our people. We know we are closer to power now than we ever have been and we have got the fight of our lives on our hands because every tool in Boris Johnson\u2019s box, he will pull out. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, added: We are here today at a pivotal political moment, a crucial moment in our political history as a country and it\u2019s not about Brexit, it is not about whether you voted to leave or remain, it\u2019s about what sort of country you want this to be. She described Johnson as a \u201crotten prime minister\u201d adding: \u201cThe sooner we get him out the better.\u201d About 1,400 people have gathered to listen to an address from Jeremy Corbyn and other senior Labour figures at the Lyric Theatre, in Salford Media City. My colleague, Lucinda Campbell, writes. The prime minister claimed he did not want one but speculation about a snap election persists. And, with Boris Johnson remaining adamant that the 31 October Brexit deadline will be honoured, Corbyn is expected to tell the crowd of Labour supporters that the party plans to stop a no-deal Brexit by continuing to push for a general election. Jonathan Marsland, 36, who works in local government in Manchester, favours legislative means of stopping no-deal: Labour\u2019s position has been incredibly nuanced from the start. We do need a general election, but only once legislation has been passed to stop no-deal. Marie O\u2019Neill, a 63-year-old community psychiatric nurse, said: We desperately need a change of government and a second referendum with remain on the ballot paper. Addressing the rally, the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said she thought Johnson had \u201cbottled it\u201d. Referencing the prime minister\u2019s speech in Downing Street, she said: \u201cI think he looked pathetic.\u201d She told the crowd: I\u2019ve got a message for Boris Johnson: We don\u2019t believe you when you say you\u2019re going to give us the money for our schools and our police and our communities. The reason we don\u2019t believe you is because you were there implementing it for the last 10 years. Scotland\u2019s chief prosecutor is to intervene in two legal challenges against Boris Johnson suspending parliament, claiming prorogation is an abuse of power, it has been announced. The Scottish government said James Wolffe, the lord advocate, has lodged applications to join the legal actions in the court of session in Edinburgh and the Royal Courts of Justice, which aim to block prorogation. The Scottish case is due to be heard in full on Tuesday morning before Lord Doherty in the court of session. The case in London led by Gina Miller, whose legal action forced Theresa May\u2019s government to put the article 50 application to a vote at Westminster, is being heard on Thursday 5 September. Miller\u2019s case has already been joined by Sir John Major, the former Conservative prime minister, and Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, while the case in Edinburgh has been filed by Joanna Cherry QC, a Scottish National party MP, and 74 other MPs and peers, along with the Good Law Project. The Scottish government said Wolffe would argue that prorogation was intended to prevent scrutiny of the UK government\u2019s Brexit plans and was, therefore, an abuse of power. Mike Russell, the Scottish government\u2019s Brexit secretary, said: Accountable government is a fundamental principle of our democracy. This attempt to suspend the UK parliament at such a critical time is a clear attempt to silence opposition and must be resisted. The democratic wishes of the Scottish people and the Scottish parliament should not be allowed to be brushed aside as if they did not matter. Here is some more reaction to the Boris Johnson statement from journalists and commentators. From the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil From Matthew Goodwin, an academic specialising in explaining populism From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham From the Economist\u2019s Anne McElvoy From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth That\u2019s all from me for today. I\u2019m handing over now to my colleague Kevin Rawlinson. From Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon Here is the full text of Boris Johnson\u2019s statement. Five weeks ago I spoke to you from these steps and said that this government was not going to hang around and that we would not wait until Brexit day - October 31 - to deliver on the priorities of the British people. And so I am proud to say that on Wednesday Chancellor Sajid Javid is going to set out the most ambitious spending round for more than a decade. I said I wanted to make your streets safer \u2013 and that is why we are recruiting another 20,000 police officers. I said I wanted to improve your hospital and reduce the waiting times at your GP. And so we are doing 20 new hospital upgrades in addition to the extra \u00a334bn going into the NHS. And I said I wanted every child in this country to have a superb education and that\u2019s why I announced last week that we are levelling up funding across the country and spending much more next year in both primary and secondary schools. And it is to push forward this agenda on these and many other fronts that we need a Queen\u2019s speech in October. While leaving due time to debate Brexit and other matters. And as we come to that Brexit deadline I am encouraged by the progress we are making. In the last few weeks the chances of a deal have been rising, I believe, for three reasons. They can see that we want a deal. They can see that we have a clear vision for our future relationship with the EU - something that has perhaps not always been the case. And they can see that we are utterly determined to strengthen our position by getting ready to come out regardless, come what may. But if there is one thing that can hold us back in these talks it is the sense in Brussels that MPs may find some way to cancel the referendum. Or that tomorrow MPs will vote \u2013 with Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 for yet another pointless delay. I don\u2019t think they will. I hope that they won\u2019t. But if they do they will plainly chop the legs out from under the UK position and make any further negotiation absolutely impossible. And so I say, to show our friends in Brussels that we are united in our purpose, MPs should vote with the government against Corbyn\u2019s pointless delay. I want everybody to know \u2013 there are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on 31 October, no ifs or buts. We will not accept any attempt to go back on our promises or scrub that referendum. Armed and fortified with that conviction I believe we will get a deal at that crucial summit in October A deal that parliament will certainly be able to scrutinise. And in the meantime let our negotiators get on with their work Without that sword of Damocles over their necks. And without an election, which I don\u2019t want and you don\u2019t want. Let us get on with the people\u2019s agenda \u2013 fighting crime, improving the NHS, boosting schools, cutting the cost of living, and unlocking talent and opportunity across the entire United Kingdom. With infrastructure education and technology It is a massive agenda. Let\u2019s come together and get it done \u2013 and let\u2019s get Brexit done by 31 October. Here is the key quote from Boris Johnson. MPs should vote with the government against Corbyn\u2019s pointless delay. I want everybody to know there are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on 31 October - no ifs or buts. We will not accept any attempt to go back on our promises or scrub that referendum. This means Johnson is saying, if the Benn bill were passed, he would refuse to be bound by it. That implies he would opt of an election as an alternative - even though Johnson also insisted that he did not want one. Boris Johnson has now finished. He did not make an explicit threat to call an election on 14 October if defeated tomorrow, as ITV\u2019s Robert Peston predicted. (See 5.59pm.) But the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg is also being briefed with exactly the same message. And Johnson did say that under no circumstances would he delay Brexit - implying that, if MPs were to pass the Benn bill, he would default to an election. I will post a summary of Johnson\u2019s comments shortly. Boris Johnson says when he became PM he said he would not wait before making changes. That is why he has made a series of policy announcements, he says. It is to push forward these measures that he needs a Queen\u2019s speech. He says he has been encouraged by the progress being made towards a Brexit deal. He says there are three reasons why it has become more likely. The EU can see the UK wants a deal, he says. It can see the UK has a vision for Brexit. And it can see the UK is preparing for no-deal. He says MPs will chop the legs off his negotiating position if they vote tomorrow to rule out no-deal. He says there are no circumstances in which he will delay Brexit. Armed with this conviction, he believes he will get a deal at the EU summit in October, he says. He says negotiators should be allowed to get on with their work \u2013 without an election. I don\u2019t want an election and you don\u2019t want one either, he says. And that\u2019s it. The Sky News helicopter has footage of the party for Tory MPs in the Number 10 garden. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has put out this statement about the Benn bill. This bill will stop Boris Johnson forcing through a reckless and damaging no-deal Brexit on 31 October. This week could be parliament\u2019s last chance to stop a no-deal Brexit. MPs must act in the national interest and support this bill. From my colleague Severin Carrell This is from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. An election on 14 October would be on a Monday. Elections are normally held on Thursday, but there is no rule saying that has to be the case and there have been general elections on non-Thursdays in the past. The last one not on a Thursday was in 1931. Here is a summary of the main points from the bill designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October - or the EU (withdrawal( No 6) bill, to give it its proper title. (See 5.29pm.) It sets two new deadlines. 19 October 2019 Under the bill, by this date the prime minister would have to either: Get MPs to pass a withdrawal agreement Get MPs to pass a motion agreeing to a no-deal Brexit Write to the EU requesting an extension to article 50 The text of the letter that would have to be sent to the president of the European council requesting an extension is set out in a schedule to the bill. It contains the second deadline. 31 January 2020 This would be the new date for the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, if the extension proposed in the bill were granted by the EU. The bill says, if both sides agree a deal after 19 October but before 31 January, Brexit could happen sooner. But it does not say what would happen if there were still no agreement by the end of January. According to Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby, Boris Johnson won\u2019t be announcing a general election tonight in his statement at 6pm. Boris Johnson is going to make a statement outside Number 10 at 6pm, it has been announced. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, has just released the text of the bill that Tory rebels and opposition MPs want to use to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, has spoken out against Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to remove the whip from any Tory MP who votes against the government tomorrow on the no-deal Brexit issue and to thus effectively deselect them ahead of the next general election. In an interview with the Spectator\u2019s Katy Balls, Rudd said it would be unfair to punish remain-voting Tories like this when the same thing did not happen to MPs who repeatedly voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal. Asked if Johnson\u2019s plan worried her, Rudd replied said: It does and I have made my views clear to the prime minister that we should not be a party that is trying to remove from our party two former chancellors, a number of ex-cabinet ministers, that the way to hold our party together and to get a deal is to bring them onside and explain to them what we\u2019re trying to do and why. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair either to consider removing the whip from a group of people who oppose no deal, which is not the government position, but as a legitimate Conservative position, and not to remove the whip from people who have consistently voted against the withdrawal agreement and may yet vote against the agreement that Boris Johnson brings back before 31 October. So I\u2019m really urging the government to think very carefully about taking such a dramatic step. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston Here is a question from below the line attracting some interest. As far as we know, the rebels plan to use standing order 24 tomorrow to trigger a debate on a motion that would allow them to take charge of the order paper to free up time to pass the bill intended to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. The Commons sits at 2.30pm tomorrow. But first there will be Foreign Office questions, and then we are expecting at least two statements, from Boris Johnson on the G7 and from Michael Gove on no-deal planning. The application for an SO24 debate would come after the statements, and then MPs would debate it the SO24 motion for up to three hours. According to Alex Wickham at BuzzFeed, the rebels and their opposition colleagues are divided as to whether to try to the pass the legislation on Tuesday night, or whether to do it on Tuesday or Wednesday. An SO24 debate has precedence over other business. And the motion that would be put to a vote at the end of the debate, the one allowing the rebels to take charge of the order paper, would prioritise the bill to rule out a no-deal Brexit. So the no-deal debate should happen before any debate on a general election. Rumours of a snap general election have sent the pound tumbling on the international currency markets, as investors brace for further political turmoil as the Brexit deadline edges closer. Sterling has slumped by almost a cent against the US dollar and sold-off sharply against the euro, sliding below $1.21 and \u20ac1.10 as election speculation spreads through the City. Analysts said the pound could drop further as the uncertainty unleashed by an election might further damage the economy or make no-deal Brexit increasingly likely, but said any surge in support for remain parties could cause sterling to rally. However, some analysts remained sceptical an election could make matters any clearer. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at the financial trading group IG, said: Anyone who thinks that an election will solve the UK\u2019s political crisis has not been paying attention over the past three years. Sterling is close to the lowest levels on record, having slumped whenever the chance of Britain leaving without a deal mounts. The pound is down by about 5% on the US dollar this year and is still worth about 19% less than on the eve of the EU referendum in 2016. These are from Sky\u2019s Sam Coates. The briefing paper as reported by Coates goes some way towards answering some of the questions posed by Philip Hammond. (See 3.53pm.) But Hammond will not be impressed by Coates\u2019 latest revelation about the \u201cdraft legal text\u201d. In a speech in Liverpool this morning Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, said a no-deal Brexit would increase poverty. He explained: To stop a no-deal Brexit is important because poverty otherwise will get worse, food prices will go up, fuel prices will go up and therefore people\u2019s cost of living will be affected and, of course, people who are giving money to food banks will find it more difficult to do so because they themselves will be under pressure. We have got to stop a no-deal Brexit in its tracks. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, has been saying that Tory MPs need to show \u201ca little bit of discipline\u201d this week. On a school visit in Bromley, he said: I think that what people need to do is show a little bit of steel and a little bit of discipline. We all got elected as members of parliament as Conservatives to deliver on Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. And we all stood on that same manifesto saying that we would do so. And we need to make sure that the prime minister has the very best hand when he goes to Europe, as he has been doing, to negotiate for a deal that will pass through parliament. And Theresa May\u2019s deal quite clearly would not pass through parliament. So we need to get something that means that it will do. In an interview on Sky News earlier, Williamson, a former chief whip and former defence secretary, also backed the threat to remove the Tory whip from any MP voting against the government to back legislation intended to rule out a no-deal Brexit. The SNP MP Stewart McDonald accused him of hypocrisy. Philip Hammond, the former chancellor and one of the leading Conservative rebels backing moves to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, has written to Boris Johnson challenging him to give details of what the government is doing to negotiate an alternative to the backstop with the EU. Hammond says he and his colleagues had been hoping to discuss these points with Johnson today before their meeting with him was cancelled. The letter, and the six questions it contains, are prompted by fears that any progress towards a deal with the EU is minimal, or non-existent. Johnson has repeatedly talked up the progress he claims to have made in his recent visits to Berlin and to Paris, and at the G7 summit in Biarritz. But according to a report in the Sunday Times (paywall) yesterday, based on \u201ca note of diplomatic briefings by French officials, circulating in London,\u201d the French do not believe Johnson is getting closer to a deal. In his story Tim Shipman says: Contrary to claims by Downing Street that Johnson has made progress at the EU level, the note says that his Brexit negotiator has so far presented \u201cnothing\u201d to Brussels and \u201cnothing of note\u201d has occurred so far in the discussions. In an interview with the Sunday Times (paywall) yesterday Boris Johnson refused to rule out creating hundreds of new pro-Brexit peers to stop the Lords legislating to stop a no-deal Brexit. Norman Fowler, the Lord Speaker of the Lords, says \u201cnothing could be worse\u201d. Fowler takes a particular interest in this because he chaired a committee that came up with ideas, which are slowly being implemented, intended to reduce the size of the Lords. In reality Johnson\u2019s threat was an empty one. In theory the government could ask the Queen to create hundreds of new peers, but the House of Lords only normally allows two new peers at most to be introduced every day and the government does not have a majority in the Lords to change its procedures. If Johnson were to create 100 new pro-Brexit peers, it would take until Christmas before they could all take their seats. The latest fear amongst anti-Brexit MPs is that Boris Johnson could announce a general election for before 31 October, but then shift the date to after, ITV\u2019s Paul Brand reports. The Scottish parliament\u2019s information centre has published a 57-page briefing (pdf) on a no-deal Brexit today. \u201cPotential border checks present the most likely immediate form of disruption following a no-deal Brexit which might result in long queues at the UK-EU borders as goods travel through customs and are subject to standards checks,\u201d it says. Owen Smith, who unsuccessfully challenged Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership in 2016, says Labour should not be backing an early election. If you want a friend in politics, get a dog, Harry Truman is reputed to have said. With his majority set to disappear this week, Boris Johnson has taken up Truman\u2019s suggestion. (See 2.27pm.) According to Johnson\u2019s partner Carrie Symonds, their new Jack Russell is called Dilyn. Jacob Rees-Mogg has accused a doctor of \u201cfear-mongering\u201d after he challenged the Commons Leader to say how many people he would accept could die as a result of a no-deal Brexit. As the Press Association reports, Dr David Nicholl, a consultant neurologist involved in the Operation Yellowhammer report into the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the NHS, called in to LBC\u2019s Ring Rees-Mogg show to ask what \u201cmortality rate\u201d he would accept if the UK crashed out of the EU without a deal. Nicholl asked: Having been involved in writing the plans for mitigation and having whistle-blown because I felt they were unsafe, what level of mortality rate are you willing to accept in the light of a no-deal Brexit? Rees-Mogg replied: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to suppose that a no-deal Brexit should lead to a mortality rate. I think this is the worst excess of Project Fear and I\u2019m surprised that a doctor in your position would be fear-mongering in this way on public radio. As PA reports, Nicholl told the prominent Brexiter: Can I remind you I wrote the plans of mitigation? But Rees-Mogg replied: Well you didn\u2019t write very good plans if you hadn\u2019t worked out how to mitigate, had you? It\u2019s fortunate they are being written by other people now who are serious about mitigating, rather than remoaners. Nicholl said people could die because of potential problems with access to drugs and radioactive isotopes in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Rees-Mogg said there were \u201creserve plans to fly drugs in if necessary\u201d. He said: This is a major focus of government policy. I think it\u2019s deeply irresponsible, Dr Nicholl, of you to call in and try to spread fear across the country. I think it\u2019s typical of remainer campaigners and you should be quite ashamed, I\u2019m afraid. UPDATE: Originally, based on the PA report, I said the caller was David Nicol, a consultant urologist. But in fact he was David Nicholl, a consultant neurologist. I\u2019ve corrected that now. Downing Street has a new dog after Boris Johnson and his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, took delivery of a rescue puppy, the Press Association reports. The Jack Russell \u2013 which has yet to be named \u2013 was carried into Number 10 to meet its new owners this morning. The rescue dog came from the Friends of Animals Wales charity, which said the \u201cgorgeous pup will be living his best life with Carrie and the prime minister at their Downing Street home\u201d. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: They are a fantastic charity run by volunteers who work around the clock to make a difference to animals. The prime minister has always been a passionate supporter of animal welfare and has always believed that animals should always get the right start in life. That\u2019s why the government has taken such significant action in this area, and that obviously includes introducing Lucy\u2019s Law. Earlier today Jeremy Corbyn suggested that Labour would back an early election any circumstances (see 12.04pm and 12.06pm) - even though Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, told the Andrew Marr Show yesterday that the party had been thinking \u201clong and hard\u201d about the risk of Boris Johnson calling a general election for after a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. On the World at One Jenny Chapman, a shadow Brexit minister (ie, a member of Starmer\u2019s team), said that if a general election were scheduled to take place after a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, Labour would not support it. She explained: Our mission here is to to prevent no deal. We do want a general election ... Our mission is very clear, and it is about preventing no deal. If that means that a general election cannot happen at that particular point, then stopping no deal must come first ... This isn\u2019t for the benefit of the Labour party. This is about preventing mass unemployment. Asked if this meant Labour could vote against an early election, Chapman replied: Theoretically. But more likely having a general election becomes one of the few ways that we are able to prevent no deal. Labour says it is confident there is a majority for the planned bill designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Assuming that the bill passes, and assuming that it is robust enough to do what it is meant to do, in those circumstances the Labour objection to an election after 31 October might no longer apply. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the easiest way to get around the rule saying the next election should not take place until 2022 (five years after the last one) would be for two-thirds of MPs to vote for an early election. Alternatively, the government could lose a vote of no confidence, and an election would take place if no alternative government won a confidence vote within 14 days. Alternatively, the government could pass a new bill to amend the FTPA to allow an early election. But, given that Boris Johnson only has a majority of one, and some Tories oppose a no-deal Brexit, he would not be able to use any of these mechanisms to call an early election without assistance from Labour. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, says the SNP would back an early election - provided it took place before 31 October. Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (prime minister), has said that he expects to have a meeting with Boris Johnson next week. He told RTE that he was always willing to listen to any proposal from the British PM, but that he had yet to hear of a convincing alternative to the backstop. He explained: The backstop is a means to an end. It is there to ensure that we continue to have frictionless trade north and south, that there is no physical infrastructure, no checks, no controls, no tariffs. We want that to continue to be the case. It has been the case since 1992, we want that to continue. Of course, I would listen to any proposals that the British prime minister may have to achieve that by an alternative means and we provide for alternative arrangements in the joint political declaration. The difficulty is that anything we have seen so far when it comes to alternative arrangements do something very different. They just manage a border, they facilitate tariffs, they facilitate checks, they facilitate controls but try to do it in a way that is invisible and unobtrusive, and that is better than nothing but it is not the outcome that we want to achieve. Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the European council\u2019s legal service whose views are generally an accurate reflection of Brussels\u2019 thinking, said last week that Britain was heading for \u201ca really deep political and probably a deep constitutional crisis\u201d. Following Michael Gove\u2019s refusal this weekend to rule out ignoring any law passed by parliament to stop no deal, Piris has now warned that the \u201cdivisive effect\u201d of Brexit means democracy and the rule of law in Britain are slipping. The Guardian\u2019s Jennifer Rankin reckons Boris Johnson\u2019s controversial decision to prorogue parliament will make it harder for the EU27 to agree a Brexit deal, partly because they do not want to be seen to be rewarding that kind of behaviour. This is from a Number 10 source, The PM is hosting all Tory MPs at Number 10 this evening. He is taking the opportunity to see cabinet as well \u2013 the cabinet calling notice should have gone out \u2013 and they will discuss the government\u2019s response to MPs seeking to take control of the legislative agenda away from the government and handing it to the opposition and Corbyn without the consent of the people. The view is that tomorrow\u2019s possible vote is an expression of confidence in the government\u2019s negotiating position to secure a deal and will be treated as such. These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. The vice-president of the European parliament has said she thinks it is unlikely that there will be a new Brexit deal at the next European council summit on 17 October. Mairead McGuinness said the EU would not succumb to threats from the UK and that Boris Johnson\u2019s approach \u201cto take back control in a more boisterous way\u201d than Theresa May was not the way to \u201cyield results\u201d. In an interview with RTE Radio\u2019s Sean O\u2019Rourke programme the Irish MEP confirmed talks were intensifying in Brussels, but she said they should not mischaracterised as renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement. Under the process, Michel Barnier would need to get a new mandate from 27 EU leaders, and in the present febrile atmosphere there was no prospect of change, she told RTE. She said: I don\u2019t see why [the EU would compromise] because, if you look at what that would involve, it would be mean that the democratically elected leaders of Europe would yield to a very unhelpful pressure that the British prime minister is heaping upon them, almost threatening that: \u2018Look, we are going either way and you are going to have to deal with us.\u2019 McGuinness said she believed Johnson\u2019s preferred option was no deal. Boris Johnson has called a unexpected meeting of the cabinet today at 5pm, multiple Whitehall sources have confirmed. The prime minister is then expected to address Conservative MPs at a summer garden party in Downing Street. The scheduling of the meeting has sent the rumour mill in Westminster into overdrive about the possibility that the government will set out plans for an snap general election this week. Though no plans have been confirmed, senior rebel sources believe that Johnson could move as early as Wednesday this week, with a motion tabled the following day which would require the support of two-thirds of MPs. A vote on the snap poll would come with a commitment that polling day would be before October 31 - though the date would ultimately be in the control of the government. A Scottish court has refused leave to appeal against a judge\u2019s decision last week to reject an application for an emergency ban on Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament last week. On Friday Lord Doherty, sitting in the court of session in Edinburgh, refused a request by lawyers for 75 anti-Brexit MPs and peers for an interim suspension and interim interdict, or injunction, of the prime minister\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. In a compromise move, Doherty instead brought forward a full hearing on the main legal case against prorogation from Friday this week to tomorrow. Joanna Cherry, the Scottish National party MP leading the group drawn from most of Westminster\u2019s opposition parties and coordinated by the Good Law Project, said on Friday that was a victory. Despite that, the group\u2019s legal team applied earlier this morning for leave to appeal Doherty\u2019s refusal to grant that emergency ban. Cherry\u2019s lawyers wanted to greatly speed up the appeal process because they expect Doherty will support the UK government\u2019s case that Johnson\u2019s move is legal tomorrow, which will require an urgent appeal at the court of session on Thursday. They worry they could lose time to get the case heard by the supreme court before next Monday, when prorogation could take effect. The Scottish judiciary tweeted that their application had been denied, and the case will go to a full hearing tomorrow as scheduled. Labour sources are playing down the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn backing an early general election without the legislation blocking a no-deal Brexit on the statute book, saying they are \u201cconvinced\u201d that there is a majority for this bill. From Sky\u2019s Sam Coates Labour sources are not contesting the Sky report saying Jeremy Corbyn would back an early election in all circumstances (see 12.06pm) - which would include MPs failing to pass the bill ruling out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, and which could also include a general election scheduled for after 31 October. \u201cWe are the opposition and we always want a general election,\u201d a source said. Here is the full text of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech. And this is what he said about the sequencing of the anti no-deal Brexit legislation and then a general election. So, first we must come together to stop no deal. This week could be our last chance. We are working with other parties to do everything necessary to pull our country back from the brink. Then we need a general election. When a government finds itself without a majority the solution is not to undermine democracy. The solution is to let the people decide, and call a general election. This implies that the no-deal legislation would have to be passed before Labour could support an early election. But, when pressed on this point at his Q&amp;A (see 12.04pm) and after (see 12.06pm), Corbyn did not rule out backing an early general election with no deal still on the table. This is from Sky\u2019s Kate McCann, who was listening to the Jeremy Corbyn speech in Salford. We may or may not get some clarification from Corbyn\u2019s office later as to whether or not this is the party\u2019s official position. In the past, officials have sometimes had to \u201cclarify\u201d remarks that Corbyn has made unscripted to journalists. Corbyn has now finished his Q&amp;A. Here is the main line. Corbyn rejected Tony Blair\u2019s call for Labour to avoid backing an early general election in favour of pushing for a referendum instead. In a speech this morning Blair said an early election could favour Boris Johnson, because of Corbyn\u2019s unpopularity. (See 10.51am.) Corbyn said Labour wanted MPs to pass legislation designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, and that he wanted a general election to follow. But he would not say what he would do if the legislation failed, or if Johnson tried to call a general election before the bill became law, or if Johnson proposed an election before 31 October. For an election to take place under the Fixed-Terms Parliaments Act, Labour would almost certainly have to vote in favour, or at least abstain. In the past No 10 sources have hinted that Johnson might try to trigger a general election to take place after the UK leaves the EU on 31 October \u2013 a proposal that Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, indicated yesterday Labour would find impossible to support. But Labour would find it much harder to oppose any election scheduled for before 31 October. Q: What would you say to Labour leave supporters? Corbyn says there were leave voters and remain voters at the weekend protests. People are alarmed at the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. He says there were many reasons for people voting leave. But no one voted leave to lose their jobs, or to secure a sweetheart deal favouring the US. So he will fight the next election on his transformative agenda, he says. He says if the PM continues with his dictatorial approach, Labour will oppose him all the way. If the PM has lost the support of parliament, it is time for that government to go. Q: Will Labour back Tory rebels if they propose legislation to prevent no deal? Corbyn says he has met the leaders of other opposition parties, apart from the Democratic Unionist party. He will work with them to stop a no-deal Brexit. He wrote to all MPs opposed to no deal asking them to back him. He says in another \u201c28 hours or so\u201d we will see what Labour is backing (ie, the text of the rebel bill). Q: Would you back a general election if it meant the UK might leave the EU without a deal on 31 October? Corbyn, who took all three questions in one go (as he usually does at press conferences), did not specifically address this question when he answered. Corbyn is now taking questions. Q: If there were a second referendum, would Labour back a Labour leave option? Q: Tony Blair says you should block a general election. But it sounds like you want one. Would you back one at any time? Corbyn says he will do everything possible to stop a no-deal Brexit. A vote of no confidence is still on the table. It is not an either/or, he says. He says he wants a general election. Labour would propose a referendum, with remain one option, and another decided by parliament. Corbyn says MPs must come together to stop a no-deal Brexit. He says Labour is working with other parties to achieve that. After that, there must be a general election, he says. He says a general election is the democratic way forward. Corbyn says he wants general election after legislation blocking no-deal gets passed. Corbyn says Labour will end austerity and invest in all regions of the country. Corbyn says when services like a library, or a Sure Start centre, close, that \u201csaps the spirit from the area\u201d. Councillors go through horrors trying to work out how they can protect services, given the extent of government cuts, he says. Corbyn says Labour will have a green industrial revolution, by retrofitting houses, thereby creating jobs and saving energy at the same time. Corbyn says the north needs a full Crossrail service. It should no longer be held back by poor transport infrastructure, he says. Corbyn says Labour has a serious plan to get the economy working in every region of the country. It includes a \u00a3250bn national transformation fund that will be based outside London, he says. He says Boris Johnson has announced a \u00a33.6bn towns fund. Labour\u2019s national transformation fund is 70 times bigger, he says. He also says Labour will use regional banks to devolve economic power. He says for years politicians have argued that the economy is beyond economic control. That is an idea that favours the super-rich. But it is not true. Through democracy, you can change in whose interests the economy works, he says. He says Labour will extend workplace democracy. Corbyn is listing various sectors of the economy that would be hammered by a no-deal Brexit. He says the Tories favour those who lend and speculate over those who make things. That is why hedge fund managers are \u201ccalling the shots\u201d under Boris Johnson. Corbyn says, with the lenders and speculators in charge, wealth and opportunity are not shared. We have the worst regional inequality in Europe, he says. Corbyn says the food industry says a no-deal Brexit will lead to food shortages. The government denies this, he says. But who do you trust? he asks. Those who work in the industry? Or Boris Johnson, who has never worked in the industry. Corbyn says a no-deal Brexit would be a Trump-deal Brexit. A no-deal Brexit is really a Trump-deal Brexit, leading to a one-sided US trade deal that will put us at the mercy of Donald Trump and the big American corporations. The pally enthusiasm of the US president for Britain\u2019s new prime minister only underlines that in Boris Johnson Trump has found a compliant British leader who will dance to his tune. Corbyn says he is not willing to accept this. Corbyn says the demonstrations at the weekend showed people will not accept Boris Johnson trying to close down parliament. He says the government is being run by a \u201cphoney populist cabal\u201d. Labour would never ignore parliament in this manner, he says. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. He starts by praising Rebecca Long-Bailey as a \u201cbrilliant\u201d MP. (It is widely assumed she is the Corbynites\u2019 favoured candidate for next Labour leader.) Corbyn says the shadow cabinet will today be finalising its plans for avoiding a no-deal Brexit. He says where he is speaking is not far from the site of the Peterloo massacre. We should never forget that people died in the struggle for democracy, he says. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary and MP for Salford and Eccles, is now introducing Jeremy Corbyn at the Labour event. The Jeremy Corbyn speech is due to start soon. There is a live feed at the top of this blog. Corbyn is in Salford, where is he also chairing a shadow cabinet meeting. The self-described alternative arrangements commission, chaired by former ministers Greg Hands and Suella Braverman, has increased its campaign to get its July report on potential solutions for the Irish border accepted by the EU, London and Dublin. \u201cEverybody needs to remember that a vote for a Brexit deal did actually pass in parliament earlier this year. The Brady amendment, calling for alternative arrangements to the Irish backstop, had a majority of 16,\u201d the commission said in a statement announcing updates to its report. It went on: The reality is that the clock is now ticking rapidly towards a no-deal on October 31st. We ask that all sides, including the British government, the EU and the Irish government, come together and use our tools to agree a new withdrawal agreement. Braverman, a Brexiter, briefed the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his principle adviser Stephanie Riso on Friday. In its new report, the commission proposes a series of changes to the political declaration that accompanied the withdrawal agreement including a \u201cclear commitment\u201d that \u201cprovisions relating to building on the backstop and the single customs territory are removed\u201d. It also states that the government\u2019s aim is no longer \u201cfrictionless trade\u201d with the EU but \u201cas frictionless as possible trade\u201d and that the political declaration needs to clearly state that a free trade agreement is the ultimate \u201cend destination\u201d. Other new proposals for the declaration include a commitment to ensure the EU \u201cdoes not introduce hostile new rules\u201d in any transition period. And it wants changes to ensure the UK\u2019s sovereign defence and security, including the \u201cfive eyes\u201d intelligence alliance, is protected. Here are the key points from Tony Blair\u2019s speech. I cannot find a text of it online yet, but it will probably appear on his foundation\u2019s website at some point. Blair said Boris Johnson wanted an early election because it would be a \u201ctrap\u201d for Labour. Rather than voting for an early election, MPs should insist on a referendum, he said: If parliament cannot agree, then the right way to consult the people is not through a general election but through a referendum. That means, as MPs from different parties have agreed, that there should not be a motion of no confidence but rather legislation preventing no deal. Should the government seek an election, it should be refused in favour of a referendum. It is counterintuitive for opposition parties to refuse an election. But in this exceptional case, it is vital they do so as a matter of principle, until Brexit is resolved. Brexit is an issue which stands on its own, was originally decided on its own and should be reconsidered on its own. The Brexiteers are laying a trap, to seem as if pushed into an election, whilst actively preparing for one. Blair said Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s unpopularity would make an election more appealing to Johnson. [The Brexiters] know there are two issues in British politics not one: Brexit; and the Corbyn leadership. It is the interplay between these two issues that has shaped and defined British politics over the past 3-4 years. Boris Johnson knows that if no-deal Brexit stands on its own as a proposition, it might well fail. But if he mixes up the Brexit question with the Corbyn question in a general election, he could succeed, despite a majority being against a no-deal Brexit, because some may fear a Corbyn premiership more. Blair acknowledged that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit as an alternative might also make some people more likely than otherwise to vote for Corbyn. But he said that Corbyn should recognise an election as \u201cthe elephant trap it is\u201d and he said Corbyn had acted \u201cresponsibly\u201d in making legislation to rule out no deal a priority this week, not a confidence vote. He went on: Leave aside what is fair or unfair: no opposition leader or party with these poll ratings has won an election. The 2017 result has inoculated the Labour party against a realistic assessment of where it stands. To be sure, an election is a risk for the Tories. Each Tory candidate will have to sign up to no deal. The Brexit party is a one man unpredictable band. Scotland will be very tough. But my bet is the Brexit party will collapse to them. The Labour party at present will struggle; a resurgent Lib Dems will do well, but not well enough to govern. The opposition vote will split. Under our system that delivers a comfortable Tory majority. Blair suggested he was surprised that Johnson did not realise people would question the legitimacy of a no-deal Brexit. Does no one presently in government, particularly those cabinet members who used to protest against the irresponsibility of such a course, understand the consequence of doing this in circumstances where a large part of the country will regard it as illegitimate? Democracy depends on a shared sense of legitimacy in decision making. Legitimacy is not the same as agreement with government. Governments do things people dislike. But outside of the political fringes, most people accept their right to do them. This is now a crisis of legitimacy. No one in government even pretends to address these anxieties. He said Brexit was difficult to resolve because there were at least three different versions of it. Not once have our nation\u2019s leadership explained to the public why Brexit has been so difficult to resolve, which is because there are at least three different versions of it \u2013 hard, soft and no-deal and all are vastly different in their implications. He said the Brexit debate was so bitter because it was about values and identity, and not just about the EU. Brexit has become so bitter because Brexit is not simply about a decision to leave the EU. It is about culture, identity, values, generation. The essence is not about trade. It is about who we are as a nation in the 21st century. Normally questions of identity play out over time, by evolution, or by staggered points of development in successive elections. But the holding of the referendum turned this into a moment of revolution. It forced us to confront a division, perhaps better unconfronted. On the one side are those who feel Britain as they know it is being cast aside, the things they like about Britain disappearing, and in their place, petty political correctness, bureaucratic obsessions, magnified and exemplified by Europe, and, above all, obedience to the god of multi-culturalism at the expense of \u2018our own culture\u2019 ... Those of us on the other side ... we look at Europe today and see 70 years of peace and relative stability. He suggested the second world war was casting \u201ca long shadow over the British psyche\u201d which was not helpful: [Pro-Brexit] Britain imagines a parallel with the second world war, a period of our history which, rightly, makes us proud. Read the speeches of the Brexiteers and they are replete with references to this feat of glory. But it casts a long shadow over the British psyche. It creates a longing to live the moment again, to see each new circumstance through the lens of its narrative, a life and death struggle between us and those who would harm us, where against all odds we triumph, a series of Darkest Hours from which we emerge to the sunlit uplands. It is not just Tory MPs planning to support the legislation intended to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October who are criticising Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to threaten rebels with the withdrawal of the whip. This is what Charles Walker, a Brexiter Tory and acting co-chair of the Conservative 1922 Committee, told the Daily Telegraph about Johnson\u2019s strategy. Walker said: I say, as a committed Brexiteer and acting co-chair of the 1922, that talk of purging good Conservatives, who were serving in government up until late July, from our ranks is extremely unpleasant and the idea is one that must be resisted. On the Today programme this morning Nick Boles, the former Conservative MP who now sits as an independent having left the party over its hard Brexit policies, said he thought his old party was dead because the \u201chard right\u201d had taken over. Asked if the Tory party was finished, he said: Yes. The hard right has taken over the Conservative party. The Conservative party has fallen prey to an almost religious obsession with the hardest form of Brexit. Boles also said that there were \u201csome people in the Conservative party who are willing to sell their principles at a pretty low price in exchange for a job in the cabinet despite what they\u2019ve said previously about a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Tony Blair is now taking questions. There is a live feed of the event here. One of the arguments Boris Johnson makes for leaving the EU by 31 October at the latest is that voters are fed up with the Brexit crisis. They just want the whole thing over, he argues, so that the government can focus on other issues, such as health and crime. It is an argument that probably resonates with many people. In his speech on Brexit this morning Tony Blair, the former Labour prime minister, said this was not a good reason for pressing ahead. He said: It has suited [the Brexiters] to ride a wave of \u2018just do it\u2019 emotion, born of public impatience. You\u2019re bored of Brexit. I\u2019m bored of Brexit. We all are. But no serious political leader would suggest that we should take a decision of this magnitude by an effluxion of patience. HuffPost has a preview of the Blair speech here. I\u2019ll post a full summary when I\u2019ve seen the text, but the BBC\u2019s Chris Mason has some excerpts. Here is a Press Association list of members of the cabinet who have defied the government whip this year - sustaining Philip Hammond\u2019s claim that Boris Johnson is being \u201cstaggeringly hypocritical\u201d. (See 8.52am.) Boris Johnson, prime minister: Voted against Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal in first two votes Dominic Raab, foreign secretary: Voted against May\u2019s Brexit deal in first two votes Priti Patel, home secretary: Voted against May\u2019s Brexit deal in all three votes Grant Shapps, transport secretary: Voted against May\u2019s Brexit deal in first two votes Theresa Villiers, environment secretary: Voted against May\u2019s Brexit deal in all three votes Esther McVey, housing minister: Voted against May\u2019s Brexit deal twice Amber Rudd, work and pensions secretary: Abstained in vote on ruling out no-deal Brexit in all circumstances in March, despite government MPs being under orders to vote against Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the Commons: Voted against May\u2019s Brexit deal in first two votes The Tory rebels planning to vote for legislation intended to block a no-deal Brexit on 31 October don\u2019t actually have a leader - Philip Hammond, Sir Oliver Letwin and Rory Stewart are all key players - but they do have a nickname, the Gaukeward squad, making David Gauke, the former justice secretary, at least their eponymous figurehead. On the Today programme this morning Gauke said he thought Boris Johnson was trying to orchestrate an early election. (See 8.52am.) Here are some other lines from his interview. Gauke said he thought there would be a 95% chance of a no-deal Brexit if efforts to legislate to block such a scenario failed in the Commons this week. He said: Frankly, there\u2019s not a credible plan coming from the government to be able to leave with a deal on October 31. I would say it\u2019s a 95% chance, to be honest, that if parliament does not act this week that we will leave without a deal on October 31. He said he had written to Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, asking the government to confirm that it would comply with any legislation passed this week. His letter was triggered by Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, refusing to confirm yesterday that the government would obey such a law. Gauke said: The rule of law is hugely important to this country and I am concerned by some of the briefings that have been put out by the government suggesting that they won\u2019t comply with the law, and I think Michael was equivocal on that question yesterday. I think it would be very helpful if the government could clarify that they believe in the rule of law. That\u2019s why I\u2019m writing to the attorney general and also the lord chancellor [Robert Buckland], who has particular responsibility for this, just to get confirmation that this government believes in the rule of law, that it will comply with the law, and if legislation is properly passed it will be complied with. Good morning. With MPs returning to the House of Commons tomorrow, and the Brexit confrontation between Boris Johnson\u2019s government and parliament set to climax in MPs trying to pass legislation this week to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, last night Johnson escalated hostilities by, as Jessica Elgot puts it, threatening to \u201cblow up his own parliamentary majority and withdraw the whip from dozens of Conservative MPs if they back plans to stop no-deal Brexit\u201d. Here is the full story. Some of those Tory MPs planning to vote with the opposition to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October are not backing down. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, posted this on Twitter at the weekend, after Johnson\u2019s plan was first revealed in the Sun. David Gauke, the former justice secretary, told the Andrew Marr Show yesterday that he would continue with his rebellion and last night the former Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt backed him. Rory Stewart, the former international development secretary, also said he was willing to lose the whip over this issue. Yesterday Johnson also cancelled a meeting planned for today with the rebels. On the Today programme this morning Gauke said the PM was acting as if he wanted to lose the key votes this week so that he could trigger a general election. Gauke explained: It\u2019s a very odd way [of trying to win round rebel MPs]. Normally there would be plenty of cajoling, friends in the cabinet would be phoning up saying: \u2018Come on, why won\u2019t you support the government, give them a bit more time.\u2019 None of that is happening. The usual operational isn\u2019t particularly happening. It does seem to me that they\u2019re almost goading people into voting against the government because I think their strategy, to be honest, is to lose this week and then seek a general election, having removed those of use who are not against Brexit, not against leaving the European Union, but believe we should do so with a deal. Gauke\u2019s analysis seems very reasonable, and it is in line with what many commentators are saying (for example, see this blogpost from the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, and this one from Robert Peston, her opposite number at ITV), but of course under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act calling an election is no longer straightforward. Johnson could only do it with opposition support and that would only be forthcoming if the timing of the election did not make a no-deal Brexit inevitable. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, gives a speech on a no-deal Brexit at a Hope not Hate event in Liverpool. 9.30am: Tony Blair, another former Labour prime minister, gives a speech on Brexit. As HuffPost reports, he will say Labour should avoid the \u201celephant trap\u201d of a snap general election that could be used to ram through a no-deal Brexit. 11am: Jeremy Corbyn gives a speech in Salford. As Jessica Elgot reports, he will argue that this week\u2019s parliamentary confrontation is a \u201cbattle of the many against the few who are hijacking the referendum result to shift even more power and wealth towards those at the top\u201d. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although mostly I will be focusing on Brexit. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up late afternoon. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Dave Prentis General secretary, Unison \u2022 In your analysis of the government\u2019s education proposals (More money, more discipline, higher salaries \u2013 the Tories are hoping to win back voters, 28 August), you wisely ask how much will make its way into headteachers\u2019 budgets.
