But as a report from the Data Justice Lab <a href=\"https://datajustice.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/data-scores-as-governance-project-report2.pdf\" title=\"\">observed</a>, in the \u201ccontext of deskilling and resource limitations in the public sector, the results of data analytics may significantly constrain and guide decision-making\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s one thing for Amazon to entice me to read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jan/21/jordan-peterson-self-help-author-12-steps-interview\" title=\"\">Jordan Petersen</a> or Twitter to push me to follow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/piersmorgan\" title=\"\">Piers Morgan</a>.

The fact that these systems are already in place \u201cwill serve as a rationale for their continued existence and a means to foreclose debate\u201d.

A report by Sky News\u2019s Rowland Manthorpe, based on research by Cardiff University\u2019s Data Justice Lab, revealed that at least 53 local authorities and almost a third of UK police forces are using \u201cpredictive algorithms\u201d to determine how to intervene in everything from traffic management to benefits sanctions. Bristol city council\u2019s integrated analytics hub, for instance, uses data on benefits, school attendance, crime, teenage pregnancy and much more to give people a \u201crisk score\u201d that is then used to flag cases for social work intervention. For local authorities, such algorithms provide cheap solutions in an age of severely reduced budgets. Their advocates insist that there is nothing to worry about, as computers never make the final decision \u2013 they simply aid humans. But as a report from the Data Justice Lab observed, in the \u201ccontext of deskilling and resource limitations in the public sector, the results of data analytics may significantly constrain and guide decision-making\u201d. It\u2019s one thing for Amazon to entice me to read Jordan Petersen or Twitter to push me to follow Piers Morgan. It\u2019s quite another for public authorities to use similar algorithms, fed with a mountain of sensitive personal data, to determine who may commit crime or be at risk of abuse. Such data practices, according to the Cardiff University report, \u201chave become normalised before there has been a chance for broader public discussion\u201d. The fact that these systems are already in place \u201cwill serve as a rationale for their continued existence and a means to foreclose debate\u201d. Isn\u2019t it time to have that debate before it\u2019s too late? \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

We are being invited to condemn a 19-year-old who has just given birth in difficult circumstances. No thought is given to how this will affect the baby\u2019s life trajectory and feelings about the UK, let alone a troubled and troubling young woman.</p> <p>The moment we create a \u201cmonster\u201d we avoid the actions needed to aid child and teenage development. The 16-year-old now being called a monster for the awful rape and murder of a six-year-old turns out to have caused concerns from the age of six. At the same time, we cut children\u2019s services.

When the headteacher responded to questions concerning one of his staff, Father David Pearce, about allegations of abuse and said: \u201cYou can be rest assured he will seek absolution for his sins\u201d, he was reflecting a view that sins are matters of faith to be decided on religious grounds rather than crimes to be decided in a secular court of law.</p> <p>What we need to see from all religious authorities is a clear recognition that when a crime is committed and, importantly, covered up, it is not just a sin to be absolved by canonical law or any other \u201cin-house\u201d procedure, but is in fact a crime, plain and simple.<br><strong>Professor David Stephens</strong><br>Brighton<br></p> <h2>Back to the old House</h2> <p>The debate about how Churchill should be judged has missed something very relevant. In 1943, faced with a House of Commons destroyed by bombing, he argued firmly for a complete reinstatement of the old House, citing particularly the value of the adversarial politics we know so well, and the dangers of an amphitheatre in which shades of opinion could be shown. It is interesting to note that Lady Astor urged him to look not to the past but to the future, but with no success.</p> <p>Today we have the EU pleading with our leaders to compromise and find common ground, failing to understand that in the present climate those are dirty words. One wonders what Churchill would make of the behaviour of the Commons today; and how the nation would now be governed if other counsels had prevailed. An interesting game: picture where today\u2019s MPs would sit in a semicircular house.<br><strong>Derek Long</strong><br>Liverpool<br></p> <h2>Baez still brilliant and timely<br></h2> <p>Kate Kellaway\u2019s revelatory interview with Joan Baez inspired me to travel to Manchester for her farewell concert (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/24/joan-baez-interview-whistle-down-the-wind-farewell-tour-folk-music-protest-songs\" title=\"\">Q&amp;A</a>, The New Review). With remarkable stamina and passion undimmed, and despite suffering from a heavy cold, Joan sang movingly through her back pages, focusing unapologetically on her very personal interpretations of Bob Dylan\u2019s great 1960s anthems.</p> <p>However, for me, the highlight was her stirring rendition of Woody Guthrie\u2019s Deportee from the 1940s. Guthrie had been incensed by radio reports of a plane crash in California that described the dozens of Mexican migrant workers who died as \u201cjust deportees\u201d.</p> <p>As Joan pointed out with feeling, the song is just as relevant today in Trump\u2019s America.<br><strong>Mike Pender</strong><br>Cardiff<br></p> <h2>An architect for our times<br></h2> <p>Frank Gehry may or may not be \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest architect\u201d (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/24/frank-gehry-at-90-still-taking-risks-interview-rowan-moore\" title=\"\">Gehry at 90</a>\u201d, The New Review).

Gemma Munday, Youth for Change London EC1 We create our own monsters Congratulations to Sonia Sodha for her thoughtful article on Shamima Begum, which summarises the dangers when politicians behave in a non-reflective way (\u201cPut yourself in Shamima Begum\u2019s shoes before you damn her out of hand\u201d, Comment). We are being invited to condemn a 19-year-old who has just given birth in difficult circumstances. No thought is given to how this will affect the baby\u2019s life trajectory and feelings about the UK, let alone a troubled and troubling young woman. The moment we create a \u201cmonster\u201d we avoid the actions needed to aid child and teenage development. The 16-year-old now being called a monster for the awful rape and murder of a six-year-old turns out to have caused concerns from the age of six. At the same time, we cut children\u2019s services. Monsters are not born but co-created. Dr Valerie Sinason London NW3 Sins, yes, but crimes too The sex abuse allegations at St Benedict\u2019s school in Ealing, west London, raise fundamental questions about how religious and secular authorities confront and deal with \u201csin\u201d (\u201cHead of Catholic order failed to tell police of sexual abuse\u201d, News). When the headteacher responded to questions concerning one of his staff, Father David Pearce, about allegations of abuse and said: \u201cYou can be rest assured he will seek absolution for his sins\u201d, he was reflecting a view that sins are matters of faith to be decided on religious grounds rather than crimes to be decided in a secular court of law. What we need to see from all religious authorities is a clear recognition that when a crime is committed and, importantly, covered up, it is not just a sin to be absolved by canonical law or any other \u201cin-house\u201d procedure, but is in fact a crime, plain and simple. Professor David Stephens Brighton Back to the old House The debate about how Churchill should be judged has missed something very relevant. In 1943, faced with a House of Commons destroyed by bombing, he argued firmly for a complete reinstatement of the old House, citing particularly the value of the adversarial politics we know so well, and the dangers of an amphitheatre in which shades of opinion could be shown. It is interesting to note that Lady Astor urged him to look not to the past but to the future, but with no success. Today we have the EU pleading with our leaders to compromise and find common ground, failing to understand that in the present climate those are dirty words. One wonders what Churchill would make of the behaviour of the Commons today; and how the nation would now be governed if other counsels had prevailed. An interesting game: picture where today\u2019s MPs would sit in a semicircular house. Derek Long Liverpool Baez still brilliant and timely Kate Kellaway\u2019s revelatory interview with Joan Baez inspired me to travel to Manchester for her farewell concert (Q&amp;A, The New Review). With remarkable stamina and passion undimmed, and despite suffering from a heavy cold, Joan sang movingly through her back pages, focusing unapologetically on her very personal interpretations of Bob Dylan\u2019s great 1960s anthems. However, for me, the highlight was her stirring rendition of Woody Guthrie\u2019s Deportee from the 1940s. Guthrie had been incensed by radio reports of a plane crash in California that described the dozens of Mexican migrant workers who died as \u201cjust deportees\u201d. As Joan pointed out with feeling, the song is just as relevant today in Trump\u2019s America. Mike Pender Cardiff An architect for our times Frank Gehry may or may not be \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest architect\u201d (\u201cGehry at 90\u201d, The New Review). However, what can be said of him is that he produces irrational architecture that fits perfectly with the irrational times we live in. Paul Notley London W4",
