Here are their full statements:</p> \n  <p>In a point of order, Barclay told the Commons:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is the second time the House has considered a wide variety of options for a way forward, it has once again failed to find clear majority for any of the options. And yet, the result of the House\u2019s decision on Friday not to endorse the withdrawal agreement means that the default legal position is that the UK will leave the EU in just 11 days\u2019 time.</p> \n   <p>To secure any further extension, the government will have to put forward a credible proposition to the EU as to what we will do with that extra time. This House has continuously rejected leaving without a deal, just as it has rejected not leaving at all. Therefore, the only option is to find a way through which allows the UK to leave with a deal.</p> \n   <p>The government continues to believe that the best course of action is to do so as soon as possible. If the House were to agree a deal this week it may still be possible to avoid holding European Parliamentary elections.</p> \n   <p>Mr Speaker, cabinet will meet in the morning to consider the results of tonight\u2019s votes and how we should proceed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Corbyn said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On a point of order, it is disappointing that no solution has won a majority this evening but I remind the House that the prime minister\u2019s unacceptable deal has been overwhelmingly rejected three times.</p> \n   <p>The margin of defeat for one of the options tonight was very narrow indeed and the prime minister\u2019s deal has been rejected by very large majorities on three occasions.</p> \n   <p>If it is good enough for the prime minister to have three chances at her deal, then I suggest that possibly the House should have a chance to consider again the options that we had before us today, in a debate on Wednesday, so that the House can succeed where the prime minister has failed; in presenting a credible economic relationship with Europe for the future that prevents us crashing out with no deal.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ca29554e4b08334583663cf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-01T22:50:19.468Z\">11.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some reaction from the business world: The national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, <strong>Mike Cherry</strong>, denounces this evening\u2019s votes as \u201cyet another failure of our political process\u201d.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Many small businesses will be thoroughly exasperated at yet another day of total stalemate. You couldn\u2019t run a business like this.</p> \n   <p>We will look to tomorrow\u2019s cabinet meeting to see leadership in coming up with realistic and swift plans to find a resolution that can win a majority in the House of Commons and agreement from the EU.</p> \n   <p>A last-minute, unplanned no-deal exit on 12 April must be avoided.

However, the decision of the Labour leadership not to support the motion is unforgivable and a damning indictment of the party.</p> \n   <p>Given everything we now know, the best way forward to break the Brexit impasse is to put the decision back to the people in a second EU referendum \u2013 and both a referendum and revoking Article 50 must be part of the next steps in this process.</p> \n   <p>People in Scotland have been ignored throughout the Brexit process. Any pretence that Scotland is treated as an equal partner in the UK has gone out the window. Whatever happens now it is clear that the only way to properly protect Scotland\u2019s interests is with independence.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Liz Saville Roberts</strong>, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster leader, is another to direct her rhetorical fire at the Labour frontbench and is backing the revocation of article 50 if a no-deal Brexit appears inevitable<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The broken Westminster system is continuing to fail the people it\u2019s meant to represent. With 11 days before we crash out of the EU, MPs must now realise we need the safety net of cancelling Brexit.</p> \n   <p>By forcing their MPs to vote against the article 50 revocation \u2018safety net\u2019, the Labour party helped the Tories increase the chances of a disastrous \u2018no deal\u2019 exit. They must now realise the error of their ways and help us put in place the insurance policy of stopping Brexit altogether if, in the next few days, a \u2018no deal\u2019 exit looks inevitable. </p> \n   <p>I also must express my disappointment with the 24 Labour MPs who voted against a People\u2019s Vote. They made the difference, they stopped a People\u2019s Vote being delivered tonight. If they had backed it, as is supposedly their party\u2019s policy, we would be looking at a very different route forward.</p> \n   <p>Instead, it looks like we are confined to repeating this process again, as the broken politics of Westminster continues to deliver disappointment for all.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ca28fe6e4b0b4d18bde452c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-01T22:39:44.371Z\">11.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The SNP MP, <strong>Joanna Cherry</strong>, whose amendment to revoke article 50 came bottom of the table, said she would now move away from trying to fix UK issues and focus on Scotland.

I know many people suspect it\u2019s because because Labour couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for a motion in the name of someone from the SNP.</p> \n   <p>Labour has put a dreadful, incompetent, hopeless Tory government in a stronger position.

Her colleague, <strong>Chuka Umunna</strong>, goes yet further:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The logical thing in this circumstance would be to put the prospect of leaving the EU with a customs union to the British people in a People\u2019s Vote with the option to remain.</p> \n   <p>At the moment, there doesn\u2019t seem to be support in the House for a general election because it won\u2019t resolve any of the Brexit chaos, it just delays making a decision.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And the leader of the Liberal Democrats, <strong>Vince Cable</strong>, agrees with both of them, saying:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>While none of the propositions passed this evening, Parliament has again given a clear steer on the direction we should take. 280 MPs, 12 more than last week, voted for a People\u2019s Vote.</p> \n   <p>In the absence of an alternative consensus option, the prime minister should now move to put her withdrawal agreement to the public, with the option to remain in the EU. This has the best chance of commanding a majority, combining those who favour the deal, with those who favour a referendum.</p> \n   <p>A fourth meaningful vote without a referendum attached will be a meaningless and fruitless exercise.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-04-01T22:47:29.649Z\">at 11.47pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ca28e19e4b0347f70e77c87\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-01T22:25:32.237Z\">11.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The EU has ruled it out over and over again but the former Brexit minister and deputy chairman of the hard Brexit-supporting European Research Group, <strong>Steve Baker, </strong>is saying the prime minister should go back to Brussels to renegotiate the deal.

They face the choice between no deal and no Brexit, unless they can go to this forthcoming European Council and table the legal text with the kind of changes which I and others have been setting out.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He says those changes would include replacing the backstop with \u201calternative arrangements\u201d, limiting the length of the implementation period and removing references to the formation of a single customs territory.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If the EU won\u2019t move then it will be necessary to move out of the EU with no withdrawal agreement.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The former foreign office minister, <strong>Alistair Burt</strong>, says <strong>Theresa May</strong> would not allow a no-deal Brexit to take place. He has said:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The prime minister has made it very clear on a number of occasions she is very concerned about a no deal.

Tonight it did whip its MPs to vote in favour, in a move that should make a big difference to the result.</p> \n  <p>During the debate Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said that the text of the Boles amendment had changed over the last five days, which partly explained what Labour had changed its position. </p> \n  <p>The latest version of the amendment is on <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmagenda/OP190401.pdf\">today\u2019s order paper.</a> Last week\u2019s version is <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmagenda/OP190327.pdf\">here.</a></p> \n  <p>Here are the four key changes.</p> \n  <p>1) The new version says the customs arrangement that the government should negotiate with the EU should include \u201calignment with the union customs code and an agreement on commercial policy, and which includes a UK say on future EU trade deals\u201d. Giving the UK a say on future EU trade deals (an optimistic request, if it is going to involve anything more than token consultation), is a specific Labour demand.</p> \n  <p>2) The new version says the new agreement with the EU must include \u201ca legally binding joint instrument\u201d saying the new arrangements would cause the backstop to be superseded.</p> \n  <p>3) The new version says the political declaration must include \u201crelevant protocols relating to frictionless agri-food trade across the UK/EU border\u201d.</p> \n  <p>4) A paragraph in the old version suggesting restrictions on EEA migrants coming to the UK has been dropped. Last week\u2019s text said the government should:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>develop and bring to this house proposals for full and fair enforcement of the rule that EEA migrants must be \u201cgenuinely seeking work\u201d and have \u201csufficient resources not to become a burden on the UK\u2019s social assistance system\u201d, in accordance with the immigration (European Economic Area) regulations 2006.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ca27161e4b08334583662e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-01T20:21:47.277Z\">9.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the light of the Tory Brexiter Andrew Bridgen saying this evening most Tories members want a \u201cmanaged no-deal\u201d (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/apr/01/brexit-latest-live-news-indicative-votes--brexiters-dismiss-customs-union-plan-as-unacceptable-as-mps-prepare-for-more-indicative-votes-live-new?page=with:block-5ca2671ee4b0b4d18bde43ea#block-5ca2671ee4b0b4d18bde43ea\">8.34pm), </a>it is worth pointing out that the European commission said on Friday that such a thing was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/mar/29/brexit-debate-latest-developments-live-news-may-at-risk-of-fresh-defeat-as-mps-debate-withdrawal-agreement-for-third-time-live-news?page=with:block-5c9e475ee4b0833458364760#block-5c9e475ee4b0833458364760\">not on offer.</a></p> \n  <p>And Bridgen was not quite right when he said the vast majority of Tory activists and members and supported a managed no-deal.

But they\u2019re unlikely to command a stable majority in parliament unless they are attached to much longer extension that allows enough time for them to be properly scrutinised and negotiated \u2013 while not precluding a new public vote.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>She also said she would only vote for a softer form of Brexit if it were tied to a second referendum.

Until now the party has called for the UK to remain aligned to the single market, but not a full member like Norway, partly on the grounds that single market membership would involve the UK accepting free movement.</p> \n  <p>But last week Labour encouraged its MPs to back the common market 2.0 plan in the first round of indicative votes on Wednesday, without formally whipping in favour. The plan was defeated, but 143 of Labour\u2019s 245 MPs voted in favour.</p> \n  <p>Common market 2.0 would involve the UK staying in the single market, and having a customs union arrangement with the EU. Effectively it is the same as what is known as Norway plus.</p> \n  <p>Thornberry said she did not know exactly how Labour would whip on the plan today, but she said it encouraged its MPs to back the plan last Wednesday, and that the same would happen again.</p> \n  <p>She stressed the need for compromise.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We find ourselves at the 11th hour, or perhaps the 59th minute of the 11th hour, trying to pull something together because of the manifest failure of the government.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think it would really shatter the party. I\u2019ve said that before. I\u2019m not sure what would happen ... It would be a clear breach of our manifesto promises. It would leave us heading into a position where, instead of taking back control, we had surrendered more control. I think that across the country there would be furious anger, and in particular in the Conservative party ...</p> \n   <p>I think what is at stake now is democracy for everyone. When people vote, does that vote count for anything? Because if we don\u2019t leave the European Union, having asked the public to decide, then the very legitimacy of democracy is on the table. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked what would happen if May did embrace the customs union idea, Baker replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m hoping not to reach that point. As a Conservative member of parliament, I would expect always to vote with the government in a confidence motion.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But, when pressed, he went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At this point I can foresee no circumstances while, as a Conservative MP, I voted against the government in a confidence motion. But we are approaching the point where the stakes are now so very high, and so transcend party politics and what this country is about, and the fundamental British value that political power rests on consent, that I think these things are coming onto the table.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Baker was clearly referring to the possibility that he could resign the Tory whip to vote against the government in a confidence motion.</p> \n  <p>Any vote of this kind would involve Baker voting with Labour even though Labour is committed to keeping the UK in the customs union for good. That sounds illogical, but Baker might be working on the assumption that losing a confidence vote could lead to May being replaced as PM by a Tory Brexiter, or that a confidence vote would stop the government legislating for a customs union Brexit, leading to the UK dropping out of the EU with no deal.</p> \n  <p>Baker\u2019s vote on its own would not make a difference. But almost 30 ERG Tories feel about as strongly about this as Baker, and if just half of them were to join him in voting with Labour in a confidence motion, they could bring down May.</p> \n  <p>A few months ago <strong>Nick Boles,</strong> another Tory, suggested that <a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/tory-former-minister-nick-boles-threatens-to-vote-against-government-if-it-seeks-no-deal-brexit-1-5823890\">he was willing to vote against the PM in a confidence motion for the opposite reason \u2013 to stop a no-deal Brexit.</a> At the time <strong>Anna Soubry</strong> said she would be willing to join him in this, but since then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/dec/18/brexit-latest-theresa-may-cabinet-no-deal-planning-tory-pro-europeans-more-likely-to-abandon-may-in-confidence-vote-than-brexiters-claims-rees-mogg-politics-live?page=with:block-5c191de2e4b072dc52e5f75b#block-5c191de2e4b072dc52e5f75b\">she has left the party anyway to join the Independent Group.</a></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e82fd0f3185071d762053d39ec8acc1c1008a82\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e82fd0f3185071d762053d39ec8acc1c1008a82/96_0_1027_616/1000.png\" alt=\"Steve Baker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Baker</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-04-01T14:10:22.905Z\">at 3.10pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ca1f472e4b0b4d18bde3edf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-01T11:42:21.581Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The SNP will vote for the common market 2.0 option tonight if it is put to a vote, the BBC\u2019s <strong>Liz Rawlings</strong> reports.

The spokesman would not say whether the government was planning to get MPs to vote on the withdrawal agreement again by incorporating it into the EU withdrawal agreement bill, and getting MPs to vote on that this week, or whether it was planning to offer MPs a choice between May\u2019s deal and the winner of the indicative votes process, but reporters were left with the impression that the second option was more probable.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman implicitly rejected <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47768884\">the chief whip\u2019s claim that the government should have been clearer after the 2017 general election about the need to go for a softer Brexit</a>.</strong> Stressing that he did not accept the term softer Brexit, the spokesman said May had repeatedly stressed the need to bring the country together in the Brexit process. The spokesman also refused to say whether the PM accepted Julian Smith\u2019s claim that May\u2019s ministers had displayed the \u201cworst example of ill discipline in cabinet in British political history\u201d. That was a judgment for historians, the spokesman said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman appeared to rule out the idea of proroguing parliament for a short period of time.</strong> Some MPs have floated this as a possibility, either to stop MPs legislating to stop a no-deal Brexit, or to allow the government to sidestep the Speaker\u2019s ruling about not putting the same proposition to a vote twice in one parliamentary session. Referring to the possibility of parliament being prorogued, the spokesman said the government had \u201cno intention of involving the Queen\u201d in the process. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman also played down suggestions that, if MPs were to legislate for a softer Brexit against the wishes of the PM, the government could ask the Queen not to grant the bill royal assent</strong>.

All four of the proposals brought to the Commons on Monday evening failed to gain a majority. The cabinet will meet on Tuesday morning to discuss the way forward, with the Brexit secretary warning that the UK is hurtling towards a no-deal scenario. The European Parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, said a hard Brexit was becoming \u201cnearly inevitable\u201d. The prospect of a general election also loomed larger, with one Downing Street adviser saying it was being discussed. The aide said the idea of May leading the Tories into a snap election being \u201ctested\u201d and was viewed by some as \u201cthe least worst option\u201d. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, demanded that Parliament be given a further chance, claiming a solution was near. Various second referendum-supporting MPs claimed they were the single best supported group in the Commons. After the refusal of his party colleagues to back his compromise, the Tory MP, Nick Boles, said he would no longer take the whip. In an emotional speech shortly after learning the result of the indicative votes, Boles said the Conservatives had refused to compromise. If you\u2019d like to read a little more, my colleagues Heather Stewart, Jessica Elgot and Rowena Mason have the full story: These tweets from my colleague, Jessica Elgot, paint a picture of a Parliament united only in acrimony this evening: Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, will hold Brexit talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Tuesday. The bilateral meeting in Paris comes ahead of talks between Varadkar and the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, who is due to visit Dublin on Thursday. A spokesman for the Irish government has said the meetings were a demonstration of strong and unwavering EU solidarity with Ireland over Brexit: The Taoiseach and President Macron will take stock of the latest developments in Westminster, and discuss the scenarios which may arise, including the possibility of a request for an extension, or ratification of the withdrawal agreement, in advance of the extraordinary meeting of the European Council on 10 April. Earlier, we brought you brief summaries of the responses of both the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay (see: 10.08pm), and the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn (see: 10.09pm). Here are their full statements: In a point of order, Barclay told the Commons: This is the second time the House has considered a wide variety of options for a way forward, it has once again failed to find clear majority for any of the options. And yet, the result of the House\u2019s decision on Friday not to endorse the withdrawal agreement means that the default legal position is that the UK will leave the EU in just 11 days\u2019 time. To secure any further extension, the government will have to put forward a credible proposition to the EU as to what we will do with that extra time. This House has continuously rejected leaving without a deal, just as it has rejected not leaving at all. Therefore, the only option is to find a way through which allows the UK to leave with a deal. The government continues to believe that the best course of action is to do so as soon as possible. If the House were to agree a deal this week it may still be possible to avoid holding European Parliamentary elections. Mr Speaker, cabinet will meet in the morning to consider the results of tonight\u2019s votes and how we should proceed. Corbyn said: On a point of order, it is disappointing that no solution has won a majority this evening but I remind the House that the prime minister\u2019s unacceptable deal has been overwhelmingly rejected three times. The margin of defeat for one of the options tonight was very narrow indeed and the prime minister\u2019s deal has been rejected by very large majorities on three occasions. If it is good enough for the prime minister to have three chances at her deal, then I suggest that possibly the House should have a chance to consider again the options that we had before us today, in a debate on Wednesday, so that the House can succeed where the prime minister has failed; in presenting a credible economic relationship with Europe for the future that prevents us crashing out with no deal. Some reaction from the business world: The national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, Mike Cherry, denounces this evening\u2019s votes as \u201cyet another failure of our political process\u201d. Many small businesses will be thoroughly exasperated at yet another day of total stalemate. You couldn\u2019t run a business like this. We will look to tomorrow\u2019s cabinet meeting to see leadership in coming up with realistic and swift plans to find a resolution that can win a majority in the House of Commons and agreement from the EU. A last-minute, unplanned no-deal exit on 12 April must be avoided. But prolonged uncertainty will leave the UK\u2019s millions of small firms unable to plan, invest or grow. Those who have managed the expense and resources of planning contingencies face mounting costs the longer this chaos continues. The Westminster leader of the SNP, Ian Blackford, shares Cherry\u2019s anger with Labour, saying a second EU referendum must now be the priority. The SNP\u2019s priority is to stop the Brexit chaos and the catastrophic consequences it will have on Scotland and the UK\u2019s economy, jobs and living standards. The public vote motion received the biggest number of votes in favour in Parliament and it is now clear that the only way to break the Brexit impasse is by bringing this back to the people \u2013 with remain on the ballot paper. It is also welcome to see growing support across the parties for the SNP\u2019s motion to revoke article 50 to avoid a no-deal Brexit outcome. However, the decision of the Labour leadership not to support the motion is unforgivable and a damning indictment of the party. Given everything we now know, the best way forward to break the Brexit impasse is to put the decision back to the people in a second EU referendum \u2013 and both a referendum and revoking Article 50 must be part of the next steps in this process. People in Scotland have been ignored throughout the Brexit process. Any pretence that Scotland is treated as an equal partner in the UK has gone out the window. Whatever happens now it is clear that the only way to properly protect Scotland\u2019s interests is with independence. Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster leader, is another to direct her rhetorical fire at the Labour frontbench and is backing the revocation of article 50 if a no-deal Brexit appears inevitable The broken Westminster system is continuing to fail the people it\u2019s meant to represent. With 11 days before we crash out of the EU, MPs must now realise we need the safety net of cancelling Brexit. By forcing their MPs to vote against the article 50 revocation \u2018safety net\u2019, the Labour party helped the Tories increase the chances of a disastrous \u2018no deal\u2019 exit. They must now realise the error of their ways and help us put in place the insurance policy of stopping Brexit altogether if, in the next few days, a \u2018no deal\u2019 exit looks inevitable. I also must express my disappointment with the 24 Labour MPs who voted against a People\u2019s Vote. They made the difference, they stopped a People\u2019s Vote being delivered tonight. If they had backed it, as is supposedly their party\u2019s policy, we would be looking at a very different route forward. Instead, it looks like we are confined to repeating this process again, as the broken politics of Westminster continues to deliver disappointment for all. The SNP MP, Joanna Cherry, whose amendment to revoke article 50 came bottom of the table, said she would now move away from trying to fix UK issues and focus on Scotland. Expressing fury with Labour for whipping against her option she has said: I don\u2019t know why they whipped against because when I spoke to Keir Starmer he was unable to give any kind of coherent explanation. I know many people suspect it\u2019s because because Labour couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for a motion in the name of someone from the SNP. Labour has put a dreadful, incompetent, hopeless Tory government in a stronger position. From now on, my principal focus will be on how best to protect Scotland from this chaos. Earlier, the People\u2019s Vote campaigner, Bridget Phillipson, was making the point that a confirmatory vote was the best supported option (see: 11.09pm). Her colleague, Chuka Umunna, goes yet further: The logical thing in this circumstance would be to put the prospect of leaving the EU with a customs union to the British people in a People\u2019s Vote with the option to remain. At the moment, there doesn\u2019t seem to be support in the House for a general election because it won\u2019t resolve any of the Brexit chaos, it just delays making a decision. And the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Vince Cable, agrees with both of them, saying: While none of the propositions passed this evening, Parliament has again given a clear steer on the direction we should take. 280 MPs, 12 more than last week, voted for a People\u2019s Vote. In the absence of an alternative consensus option, the prime minister should now move to put her withdrawal agreement to the public, with the option to remain in the EU. This has the best chance of commanding a majority, combining those who favour the deal, with those who favour a referendum. A fourth meaningful vote without a referendum attached will be a meaningless and fruitless exercise. The EU has ruled it out over and over again but the former Brexit minister and deputy chairman of the hard Brexit-supporting European Research Group, Steve Baker, is saying the prime minister should go back to Brussels to renegotiate the deal. He has told the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme: When the Cabinet meet tomorrow they have got some very hard choices to make. They face the choice between no deal and no Brexit, unless they can go to this forthcoming European Council and table the legal text with the kind of changes which I and others have been setting out. He says those changes would include replacing the backstop with \u201calternative arrangements\u201d, limiting the length of the implementation period and removing references to the formation of a single customs territory. If the EU won\u2019t move then it will be necessary to move out of the EU with no withdrawal agreement. The former foreign office minister, Alistair Burt, says Theresa May would not allow a no-deal Brexit to take place. He has said: The prime minister has made it very clear on a number of occasions she is very concerned about a no deal. She\u2019s said that for no deal to happen we would have to have express consent in the House of Commons. I hope we don\u2019t have a general election because I don\u2019t see what a general election would do to resolve the situation, it leaves the decisions that still have to be made until after the election. Of course, May\u2019s stated position has also been that \u201cno deal\u201d would be better than a \u201cbad deal\u201d. The Labour MP, Stephen Kinnock, who tabled the common market 2.0 option alongside Nick Boles and others, says MPs have taken a step towards no deal. It\u2019s very messy. I just wish we could come up with something that could win tonight. The common market has picked up a lot of support and I think we have definitely taken a step towards no deal. In the end, it comes down to the prime minister: I think she has to drop her red lines and move towards the single market and customs union because she knows that with these numbers she\u2019s easily over the line. The Tory MP and former attorney general, Dominic Grieve, is unperturbed by the second failure to find an alternative path that MPs can support. It may appear tedious but I always thought when we started this process it was going to take several goes to get there. Now we need to start talks about whether some of these concepts can be merged. It\u2019s obvious there\u2019s a preferred route by Parliament for a customs union and some form of regulatory alignment ... and a large number for holding a referendum. That\u2019s the way forward, but if we\u2019re going to get there that\u2019s going to require those promoting a customs union to vote for a referendum and vice versa. The prime minister\u2019s deal has no special magic over and above the rest \u2013 the awful, difficult truth is her deal has commanded less support than the deals we have been looking at this evening. Bridget Phillipson, the Labour MP who campaigns with the People\u2019s Vote campaign, says that, while it could not gain a majority, a confirmatory vote was the best supported of the options presented to the Commons. Parliament has also briefly examined whether alternative Brexit options might be better than the one the prime minister has so often proposed. Although there are merits in both a customs union and a Norway-style deal, both would be very far from what was promised in 2016. We now need a longer extension to the article 50 process, so that we can kick the tyres of these proposals properly, as well as ensure any proposal carries the support of all those MPs like myself who want the public to have the final say. It would be a mistake for Parliament to impose any deal on the people, now that we know it cannot meet the expectations raised for Brexit. As such, a confirmatory referendum should not be judged as one option jostling for support in this crisis, but as a sensible compromise solution to this crisis. Here is the Guardian\u2019s guide to how MPs voted on the four amendments. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. These are from the Sun\u2019s Brussels correspondent, Nick Gutteridge. This is how the parties voted on Nick Boles\u2019 common market 2.0 amendment. (Labour MPs were being whipped to vote in favour; the Tories had a free vote, although cabinet ministers had to abstain.) For common market 2.0 Labour: 185 Conservatives: 33 SNP: 32 Independents: 5 Plaid Cymru: 4 Lib Dems: 2 Total: 261 Against common market 2.0 Conservatives: 228 Labour: 25 Independents: 14 DUP: 10 Lib Dems: 4 Green: 1 Total: 282 The 37 Conservative MPs to support Ken Clarke\u2019s customs union amendment were: Richard Benyon (Newbury), Nick Boles (Grantham and Stamford), Steve Brine (Winchester), Robert Buckland (South Swindon), Alistair Burt (North East Bedfordshire), Alex Chalk (Cheltenham), Kenneth Clarke (Rushcliffe), Alberto Costa (South Leicestershire), Jonathan Djanogly (Huntingdon), Alan Duncan (Rutland and Melton), Tobias Ellwood (Bournemouth East), Mark Field (Cities of London and Westminster), Vicky Ford (Chelmsford), Luke Graham (Ochil and South Perthshire), Richard Graham (Gloucester), Damian Green (Ashford), Stephen Hammond (Wimbledon), Richard Harrington (Watford), Oliver Heald (North East Hertfordshire), Nick Herbert (Arundel and South Downs), Margot James (Stourbridge), Jeremy Lefroy (Stafford), Oliver Letwin (West Dorset), Paul Masterton (East Renfrewshire), Anne Milton (Guildford), Andrew Mitchell (Sutton Coldfield), Nicky Morgan (Loughborough), Robert Neill (Bromley and Chislehurst), Sarah Newton (Truro and Falmouth), Guy Opperman (Hexham), Mark Pawsey (Rugby), Victoria Prentis (Banbury), Antoinette Sandbach (Eddisbury), Nicholas Soames (Mid Sussex), Caroline Spelman (Meriden), Rory Stewart (Penrith and The Border), Edward Vaizey (Wantage). And the 10 Labour MPs who defied the whip and voted against the Clarke amendment were: Ronnie Campbell (Blyth Valley), Stephen Hepburn (Jarrow), Kate Hoey (Vauxhall), John Mann (Bassetlaw), Siobhain McDonagh (Mitcham and Morden), Anna McMorrin (Cardiff North), Owen Smith (Pontypridd), Jo Stevens (Cardiff Central), Graham Stringer (Blackley and Broughton), Paul Williams (Stockton South). Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, says a no-deal Brexit (which is what they mean in Brussels by the term \u201chard Brexit\u201d) has become \u201cnearly inevitable\u201d. From my colleague Patrick Wintour Mark Francois, the Tory Brexiter, seems to be rather fond of \u201cUp Yours\u201d as a salutation. Perhaps it\u2019s the Brexit motto ... This is from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh. This is how the parties voted on the customs union amendment. (Labour MPs were being whipped to vote in favour; the Tories had a free vote, although cabinet ministers had to abstain.) For customs union Labour: 230 Conservatives: 37 Independent: 5 Lib Dems: 1 Total: 273 Against customs union Conservatives: 236 Independents: 14 DUP: 10 Labour: 10 Lib Dems: 5 Green: 1 Total: 276 You can read the detailed division results here. Labour\u2019s Peter Kyle says Stephen Barclay should have shown more humility. If there is not majority for any proposition, then minorities have to come together, he says. Vicky Ford, a Conservative, says the PM\u2019s deal got more votes last week than any of the options did today. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, says the UK will now leave the EU without a deal in 11 days\u2019 time unless the PM acts. Yet MPs have voted to rule out a no-deal Brexit. He says he wants to know if Theresa May intends to make a statement announcing that she will write to the EU asking for another article 50 extension. Julian Lewis, a Tory Brexiter, says 157 Tories voted last week in favour of a no-deal Brexit. Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, says his customs union did not get a majority because some people\u2019s vote supporters would not back it because they only wanted to back a second referendum. And some MPs would not back it because they wanted common market 2.0, even though they would have been happy with the customs union plan too, he says. He says he sometimes thinks this house is not very good at doing politics. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, says there would be a big majority if MP were allowed to vote on backing May\u2019s deal subject to a referendum. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, says the only proposition that has got a majority in the Commons is the Brady amendment. Nick Boles, the Conservative MP behind the common market 2.0 amendment, says he regrets to announce that his amendment has failed. That is because his party refused to compromise, he says. He says as a result he will refuse to sit in the Commons as a Conservative. I have given everything to an attempt to find a compromise that can take this country out of the European Union while maintaining our economic strength and our political cohesion. I accept I have failed. I have failed chiefly because my party refuses to compromise. I regret therefore to announce I can no longer sit for this party. Two weeks ago Boles resigned from his local association after they disagreed with what he was doing in the Commons to block a no-deal Brexit. At the time he said he wanted to carry on taking the Conservative whip in the Commons. But now he has quit the whip too. Nick Boles says he is resigning the Tory whip because of the party\u2019s unwillingness to compromise. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says a vast majority of Scottish MPs voted to stay in the single market, and voted for a second referendum. He says the voices of Scottish MPs are being ignored. The day is coming when Scotland will gain its independence, he says. Jeremy Corbyn says if May can put her deal to the house three times, the other options should get a third chance too. He says May\u2019s plan has been rejected. And one of the options tonight was only defeated very narrowly, he says. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, says no solution has won a majority. But the Commons can still avoid a no-deal Brexit, and avoid having to hold European elections, by voting for the PM\u2019s deal this week. John Bercow, the Speaker, is reading out the results of the indicative votes ballot now. MPs had to vote on four of the amendments on the order paper. C - Ken Clarke\u2019s for a customs union The Tory former chancellor Ken Clarke\u2019s customs union plan requires any Brexit deal to include, as a minimum, a commitment to negotiate a \u201cpermanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union with the EU\u201d. This was defeated by the smallest margin in the first round, falling just six votes short. For: 273 Against: 276 Majority against: 3 D - Nick Boles\u2019 for common market 2.0 Tabled by the Conservatives Nick Boles, Robert Halfon and Dame Caroline Spelman, Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock and Lucy Powell plus the SNP\u2019s Stewart Hosie. The motion proposes UK membership of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) and European Economic Area. It allows continued participation in the single market and a \u201ccomprehensive customs arrangement\u201d with the EU after Brexit \u2013 including a \u201cUK say\u201d on future EU trade deals \u2013 would remain in place until the agreement of a wider trade deal that guarantees frictionless movement of goods and an open border in Ireland. For: 261 Against: 282 Majority against: 21 E - Peter Kyle\u2019s for a confirmatory public vote It has been drawn up by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson. This motion would require a public vote to confirm any Brexit deal passed by parliament before its ratification. This option, tabled last time by the Labour former foreign secretary Dame Margaret Beckett, polled the highest number of votes although it was defeated by 295 votes to 268. For: 280 Against: 292 Majority against: 12 G - Joanna Cherry\u2019s for revoking article 50 in the face of no-deal Brexit The SNP MP Joanna Cherry joins Grieve and MPs from other parties with this plan to seek an extension to the Brexit process, and if this is not possible then parliament will choose between either no deal or revoking article 50. An inquiry would follow to assess the future relationship likely to be acceptable to Brussels and have majority support in the UK. For: 191 Against: 292 Majority against: 101 This is from the Conservative MP James Heappey. The division bells are ringing in the Commons. That means the results of the indicative votes will be announced in 10 minutes. Last week Labour unofficially encouraged its MPs to vote for the Nick Boles common market 2.0 amendment, but it did not formally back it. Tonight it did whip its MPs to vote in favour, in a move that should make a big difference to the result. During the debate Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said that the text of the Boles amendment had changed over the last five days, which partly explained what Labour had changed its position. The latest version of the amendment is on today\u2019s order paper. Last week\u2019s version is here. Here are the four key changes. 1) The new version says the customs arrangement that the government should negotiate with the EU should include \u201calignment with the union customs code and an agreement on commercial policy, and which includes a UK say on future EU trade deals\u201d. Giving the UK a say on future EU trade deals (an optimistic request, if it is going to involve anything more than token consultation), is a specific Labour demand. 2) The new version says the new agreement with the EU must include \u201ca legally binding joint instrument\u201d saying the new arrangements would cause the backstop to be superseded. 3) The new version says the political declaration must include \u201crelevant protocols relating to frictionless agri-food trade across the UK/EU border\u201d. 4) A paragraph in the old version suggesting restrictions on EEA migrants coming to the UK has been dropped. Last week\u2019s text said the government should: develop and bring to this house proposals for full and fair enforcement of the rule that EEA migrants must be \u201cgenuinely seeking work\u201d and have \u201csufficient resources not to become a burden on the UK\u2019s social assistance system\u201d, in accordance with the immigration (European Economic Area) regulations 2006. In the light of the Tory Brexiter Andrew Bridgen saying this evening most Tories members want a \u201cmanaged no-deal\u201d (see 8.34pm), it is worth pointing out that the European commission said on Friday that such a thing was not on offer. And Bridgen was not quite right when he said the vast majority of Tory activists and members and supported a managed no-deal. They do, but as this ConservativeHome survey suggests, even more of them, 75%, want a pure no-deal, more than the 70% who want a managed no-deal. Like Sajid Javid (see 6.51pm), Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has used Twitter to explain why he is opposed to the UK staying in the customs union. In the Commons the sitting resumed a few minutes ago. But then the government pulled five motions relating to secondary legislation that were on the order paper (four of them Brexit-related), and a motion relating to membership of the Scottish affairs committee went through on the nod. So there was no debate. John Bercow, the Speaker, then suspended proceedings again until we get the results of the votes. The Commons authorities are saying that could be at 10.30pm. Andrew Bridgen, the hardline Tory Brexiter, told Channel 4 News earlier that Theresa May had had \u201cone chance to save the Conservative party\u201d by backing a no-deal Brexit next week. He said: The prime minister has the choice. She has got over half the parliamentary party, the vast majority of our volunteers and members in the country and our supporters supporting a managed no-deal Brexit on April 12 which would end the uncertainty for business and get us out of the European Union. I don\u2019t have confidence in Mrs May but she has one chance to save the Conservative Party, to save our democracy and get us out of the EU. The indicative votes debate is now over. John Bercow, the Speaker, is telling MPs that they have half an hour to cast their vote, on paper in the division lobbies. The sitting of the Commons is now suspended for half an hour. At 8.30pm MPs will return to debate two standing orders (one relating to animals, and one relating to trade). The results of the ballot will be announced once they have been counted, probably after 10pm. Vicky Ford, a Conservative, says she will back the custom union amendment. Being in a customs union is not the same as being in the customs union, she says. She says the UK would be out of the common agricultural policy and out of the common fisheries policy. Labour\u2019s Chris Ruane is speaking in the debate now. He says politics is the art of compromise. He says he will be voting for all four options, and he urges other MPs to do the same. Anne Main, a Conservative, says the UK is very unlikely to have control over its immigration policy under the common market 2.0 plan. Robert Halfon, the Conservative and one of the main supporters of the common market 2.0, says common market 2.0 would be a workers\u2019 Brexit. It would safeguard workers\u2019 rights. It would also avoid the need for the backstop, because it could be implemented before the end of the transition period. And it is a unifying Brexit, he says, because it has the support of MPs from across the Commons. Sammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, says the DUP will not be voting for any of the amendments on the order paper tonight. They do not safeguard the union, he claims, and they do not deliver Brexit. On the PM programme earlier Nadhim Zahawi, the children\u2019s minister, said that any Brexit proposal that gains a majority in tonight\u2019s vote should be put up against Theresa May\u2019s plan in a head-to-head contest. He said: I would like the option that parliament comes up with put up against the prime minister\u2019s deal. I am confident that the prime minister\u2019s deal would win the day. I\u2019m not sure they will agree on anything tonight but if they do and we put it up against the prime minister\u2019s deal, the prime minister\u2019s deal would be infinitely better. At the Number 10 lobby briefing this morning the prime minister\u2019s spokesman implied that May was seriously considering this option. (See 12.12pm.) The defence minister Tobias Ellwood told Channel 4 News he thought MPs were coalescing around a customs union. \u201cI think that\u2019s where we are heading towards,\u201d he said. When it was put to him that this would go against the Conservative party manifesto, he said: When you put your deal through three times and colleagues and others have not supported it, but you still want to honour the referendum result itself, you still want to get out of Europe, then something small has to give. In this case it probably is going to end up being the customs union. In his speech a few minutes ago, explaining why Labour was backing the common market 2.0 amendment, Keir Starmer said that amendment had been revised since last week (when Labour was not formally backing it) and that it now had more detail about the form of the customs union envisaged. He said there were still differences between the amendment and Labour\u2019s position. But it was a \u201ccredible proposition\u201d, he said. As the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire reports, Jeremy Corbyn has written to Labour MPs about tonight\u2019s votes. Corbyn\u2019s letter makes it clear that Labour is now backing the common market 2.0 plan because it agrees with every aspect of it. He says Labour is still pushing for its Brexit plan, but that it is backing common market 2.0 because aspects of both plans overlap and it wants to \u201cbreak the deadlock\u201d and find \u201cconsensus\u201d. The Conservative Ed Vaizey is speaking now. He says he will vote for the customs union amendment and the common market 2.0 amendment. He says he is alarmed that some of his colleagues want a no-deal Brexit. The fact is that too many of our colleagues have decided that they are the self-appointed interpreters of Brexit and that anything that gets in their way must be stopped. Starmer says Labour will not be backing Cherry\u2019s amendment. Joanna Cherry intervenes to ask what Starmer what Labour\u2019s working-class voters will think if the UK crashed out with a no-deal Brexit because Labour did not back her amendment. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is speaking now. He says Labour is whipping its MPs to support amendments C (the customs union one), D (the common market 2.0 one) and E (the second referendum one). He says Labour\u2019s preference is the approach it set out in a letter to Theresa May in January, saying it wanted single market alignment. But he says that the common market 2.0 has similarities with what Labour is proposing, and that is what the party is supporting it. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is speaking in the debate now. The Conservative Ed Vaizey asks if it is true that a letter signed by 170 Tory MPs has gone to Theresa May urging her to opt for a no-deal Brexit. Has Barclay signed it? Barclay says he has not signed the letter. He says he sees the PM most days, and tells her what he thinks when they meet. As Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall reports, the Tory Brexiter Crispin Blunt has signalled that he would consider voting against the government in a confidence motion to stop Theresa May implementing a customs union. His fellow Brexiter Steve Baker issued the same threat earlier. (See 1.19pm.) Dame Caroline Spelman, the Conservative pro-European, is speaking in the debate. She says the Conservative party manifesto said the party would take the UK out of \u201cthe\u201d customs union. But the Clarke amendment talks about negotiating \u201ca\u201d customs union with the EU, she says. She says that there is a difference, and she will be backing the Clarke amendment. Sajid Javid, the home secretary and a leading contender in the forthcoming Conservative leadership contest, has used Twitter to stress his opposition to a customs union. That is what Chris Grayling was saying this morning too. See 9.39am. The Conservative MP Huw Merriman has just finished speaking in the debate. He confirmed he would vote for the second referendum amendment (which was the Beckett amendment last week, but which has now metamorphosed into the Kyle amendment). He voted for it last week too. Officials have been given the green light to begin preparations for European elections in May as a \u201ccontingency\u201d measure, the Press Association reports. David Lidington, effectively the deputy prime minister, said returning officers would be reimbursed by Whitehall for \u201creasonable\u201d expenses incurred to prepare for the May 23 poll, which takes place almost three years after the UK voted to leave the European Union. The UK would be required to take part in the elections if a delay to Brexit is sought by the government. Lidington stressed that \u201cit remains the intention for the UK to leave the EU with a deal and not take part in the European parliamentary elections in May\u201d. But in a letter to the Electoral Commission, he said: I am able to confirm that Cabinet Office will reimburse reasonable spending by returning officers on contingency preparations for European parliament elections. Advice issued to returning officers, the local officials responsible for running elections around the country, said that the rejection of Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement by MPs on Friday meant \u201cthe opportunity to guarantee that the UK would not participate in EP elections has been removed\u201d, the Press Association reports. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative pro-European, is speaking now. Referring to the meeting in his constituency on Friday night, where activists passed a motion of no confidence in him because of his opposition to Brexit, he says he found himself using the government\u2019s own figures to explain the administrative cost to business of a hard Brexit (\u00a313bn). Yet people professing to be supporters of the government and his party accused him of lying, he says. Back in the debate, John Bercow, the Speaker, says 40 backbenchers want to speak in the debate. They will not all get called, he says. The debate will run until 8pm. The customs union and common market 2.0 amendments both have nothing to say about whether article 50 would need to be extended again, and if so, for how long. Both amendments imply that adapting the prime minister\u2019s deal would be relatively straightforward, and that therefore there would be no need for a long Brexit delay, but they are not specific, and Ken Clarke and Nick Boles did not particularly address this issue in their speeches. The People\u2019s Vote campaign thinks MPs are ignoring the need for a long article 50 extension, which is something that would be necessary for its preferred option, a second referendum, to become possible. It has put out this statement making that point from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett. She said: Theresa May has failed three times to get her deal through parliament and force it on the British people: which is why MPs are now, at long last, looking at other forms of Brexit that could off-set some of the damage to our economy. But such alternatives are still bound to leave millions of voters disappointed or disillusioned because any version of Brexit will break many of the promises made in the last referendum, cause real costs to our economy or to our sovereignty, and continue the chaos of endless negotiations. I\u2019m happy to vote for options like a customs union today because they deserve proper scrutiny. But they\u2019re unlikely to command a stable majority in parliament unless they are attached to much longer extension that allows enough time for them to be properly scrutinised and negotiated \u2013 while not precluding a new public vote. She also said she would only vote for a softer form of Brexit if it were tied to a second referendum. She said: In the end, MPs will probably decide on some version of a Brexit deal to avoid a \u2018no deal\u2019 departure. But I \u2013 and many other MPs \u2013 will only support it on condition that the British people get to decide on it too. A people\u2019s vote is not an option in the Brexit crisis, it is the solution to the crisis. Here is an extract from the Extinction Rebellion news release about their protest. Today 11 activists from Extinction Rebellion stripped off in the House of Commons public gallery in an attempt to draw politicians\u2019 attention to the climate and ecological crisis. Two of the group wore full grey body paint and elephant masks to bring the message that politicians neglect of the climate crisis has become an \u2018elephant in the room\u2019. Inspired by the suffragettes\u2019 protest in the same building over 100 years ago, activists glued their hands to surfaces in the public gallery. Mark \u00d8vland, 35, said: \u201cWe are impelled to act in this way because the most important and pressing issue of our time is being flagrantly and recklessly ignored by our government and media. By undressing in parliament, we are putting ourselves in an incredibly vulnerable position, highlighting the vulnerability that all of us share in the face of environmental and societal breakdown. There is an elephant in the room and it is demanding attention.\u201d The SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry is speaking now. Her amendment would ensure that, if the UK were one day away from a no-deal Brexit, the government would have to get parliament to vote in favour. If MPs voted against, the PM would have to revoke article 50 immediately, and hold an inquiry into whether an alternative Brexit might be acceptable to the UK and the EU. The Extinction Rebellion protest is now over, but Cherry can\u2019t resist another joke. Her amendment would ensure the PM did not go \u201cnaked into the negotiating chamber\u201d, she says. If naked climate change protesters are your thing, Extinction Rebellion has tweeted some more pictures of the activists in the public gallery. They glued themselves to the glass, apparently. The glass screen was installed a few years ago because security officials started to worry about the risk of someone throwing something like anthrax into the Commons chamber. At the time no one imagined it would get used quite in this manner. Boles says, under his plan, as a member of Efta, the UK would be able to apply an emergency brake to restrict free movement if necessary. And he says this can be applied on a regional basis. Boles welcomes the fact that the SNP are backing his amendment. He says it is the compromise of choice for the Commons. Nick Boles, the Conservative MP, is speaking now in favour of his common market 2.0. He says constituents will breathe \u201ca deep sigh of relief\u201d if MPs can support one of the plans on the order paper. Anna Soubry, the former Tory who now sits as an Independent Group MP, says Boles\u2019 motion only talks about changing the political declaration. Yet the customs union one refers to changing the withdrawal agreement too. She says that would make Boles\u2019 amendment non-binding. A future government could ignore it, she says. Boles says his amendment also says that the common market 2.0 plan must be included in legislation, in the EU withdrawal agreement bill. You can read the text of all the amendments on the order paper (pdf). From the Conservative MP James Heappey Labour\u2019s Peter Kyle is still speaking in the debate. He is trying not to get distracted by the disturbance in the public gallery, although he could not resist a joke about \u201cthe naked truth\u201d. Justine Greening, the Tory backbencher also in favour of a second referendum, got in on the act with an intervention about \u201cfleshing out\u201d an argument. Making the case for a referendum, he says there have been two examples of confirmatory referendums in recent years; the referendum after the Good Friday agreement, and the one for an alternative vote. The Tory Brexiter Nigel Evans asks Kyle how he squares supporting a second referendum with the Labour manifesto, which said Labour backed the referendum result. Kyle says the Labour manifesto was published two and a half weeks after he was selected as a candidate. And the Chequers plan was not published until two and a half years after the referendum, he says. From the Tory MP Ed Vaizey Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has effectively confirmed that her party will abstain on the common market 2.0 amendment. Speaking at a press conference in Belfast earlier this afternoon, she said her party would take a final decision after the Speaker\u2019s selection of amendments was announced. But she said there would be \u201cno surprises\u201d in the party\u2019s position. Last week the DUP abstained on common market 2.0 Foster also denied claims that the DUP MPs were split 7-3 split, with three of them in favour of Theresa May\u2019s deal. \u201cNo, there\u2019s no splits within the Democratic Unionist party,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure where that\u2019s coming from.\u201d Asked if the DUP would accept a softer Brexit if it was without a backstop, she said: We have a very simple way of judging all of this. It\u2019s what will protect the Union and what will respect the referendum result and that\u2019s always been our position. We have been very clear about our one red line and that remains the position. It\u2019s of no surprise to anyone that the Union will always be our first priority and that still remains the case. Labour\u2019s Peter Kyle is speaking in the Commons now. But there seems to be some distraction. He has just said MPs should look away. These are from the BBC\u2019s Andrew Sinclair. I\u2019m watching the debate on the TV feed and cannot see what is happening in the gallery because it is never televised. Clarke says people say, under a customs union, the UK would not be able to strike its own trade deals. But it would be able to strike trade deals on services, he says. He says he thinks he has been involved in more trade deals than anyone else in the Commons. That is not boasting, he says. It is just a consequences of his \u201clongevity\u201d. He says tariffs are not the big issue in trade deals any more. What matters are regulations, he says. In the coalition government he led on the EU-US trade deal, he says. He says it is wrong to think the Americans might tighten agricultural standards in response to pressure from the UK. The US won\u2019t take any notice, he says, because the agricultural lobby in the US is extremely powerful. The Brexit process has been a \u201cshambles\u201d, he says. \u201cToday we have got to start to bring that to an end.\u201d He describes his amendment \u201cas the basic, obvious beginning\u201d. Last week the DUP voted against Clarke\u2019s customs union amendment. Clarke says he does not understand why. Under his plan, there would be no tariffs and no rules-of-origin checks. He says the backstop would become \u201cirrelevant\u201d and \u201csuperfluous\u201d. The SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry says her party cannot support Clarke\u2019s customs union amendment because it does not include free movement. Having free movement is important for the Scottish economy, she says. Clarke says people\u2019s vote supporters will not do their cause any good if they vote for their plan but refuse to vote for his too, in the hope that they can drive support for it down. Clarke is refusing to take interventions. He criticises Brexiters for filibustering earlier, taking away the time available for this debate. In the 1970s MPs used to sit all night to debate much less important issues, he says. He says he is not advocating going back to those days, but he says he is fed up of seeing MPs being given just three minutes to make a speech because people want to leave for dinner at 7pm. Referring to his own customs union amendment, Clarke says he thinks the public would favour the UK staying in the economic union, but leaving the political part of the EU. Ken Clarke, the Conservative pro-European, is opening the debate. He says he hopes that one or two options will finally get a majority. MPs should vote, not just for one option, but for any option they can support, he says. He says they need to discover what compromise MPs can accept. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, has described all four options being voted on tonight as remain options. That is because two of them, C and D, are for a soft version of Brexit, and the other two, E and G, could lead to Brexit being halted. (See 5pm.) The business motion was passed by a majority of 45, not 50, as I wrongly said earlier. Sorry about that. John Bercow, the Speaker, announces he has selected four amendments. C - Ken Clarke\u2019s for a customs union The Tory former chancellor Ken Clarke\u2019s customs union plan requires any Brexit deal to include, as a minimum, a commitment to negotiate a \u201cpermanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union with the EU\u201d. This was defeated by the smallest margin in the first round, falling just six votes short. On 27 March, MPs voted against this option by 271 t0 265. D - Nick Boles\u2019 for common market 2.0 Tabled by the Conservatives Nick Boles, Robert Halfon and Dame Caroline Spelman, Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock and Lucy Powell plus the SNP\u2019s Stewart Hosie. The motion proposes UK membership of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) and European Economic Area. It allows continued participation in the single market and a \u201ccomprehensive customs arrangement\u201d with the EU after Brexit \u2013 including a \u201cUK say\u201d on future EU trade deals \u2013 would remain in place until the agreement of a wider trade deal that guarantees frictionless movement of goods and an open border in Ireland. On 27 March, MPs voted against this option by 283 to 189. E - Peter Kyle\u2019s for a confirmatory public vote It has been drawn up by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson. This motion would require a public vote to confirm any Brexit deal passed by parliament before its ratification. This option, tabled last time by the Labour former foreign secretary Dame Margaret Beckett, polled the highest number of votes although it was defeated by 295 votes to 268. On 27 March, MPs voted against this option by 295 to 268. G - Joanna Cherry\u2019s for revoking article 50 in the face of no-deal Brexit The SNP MP Joanna Cherry joins Grieve and MPs from other parties with this plan to seek an extension to the Brexit process, and if this is not possible then parliament will choose between either no deal or revoking article 50. An inquiry would follow to assess the future relationship likely to be acceptable to Brussels and have majority support in the UK. On 27 March, MPs voted against this option by 293 to 184. The Letwin business motion has been passed by 322 votes to 277 - a majority of 45. MPs are now voting on the business motion. Last week, when MPs voted on the business motion ahead of the first indicative votes debate, the government was defeated by a majority of 44. There were 33 Tories voting against the whip. Kate Hoey, the Labour Brexiter, is speaking now. She says she has \u201cvery grave concerns\u201d about the Letwin process. In the Commons the debate on the business motion is still going ahead. Jacob Rees-Mogg is speaking now, and another Tory Brexiter, Sir Bernard Jenkin, also spoke against the business motion earlier. Rees-Mogg is not exactly being brief. It sounds a bit like a filibuster, as if the Brexiters are keen to use up the time that could be devoted to the main debate. Sir Bill Cash made the same point about suspending standing order 14 being a \u201cconstitutional revolution\u201d (see 4.06pm) in the indicative votes debate last week. After that, the former Lib Dem MP David Howarth got in touch to ask whether this was the same Bill Cash who, nine years ago, was in favour of the idea. While Gordon Brown was prime minister a committee chaired by the then Labour MP Tony Wright recommended some sweeping changes to the way that the Commons operates. Some of the ideas, such as the election of select committee chairs, were adopted. But one of the proposals, for the establishment of a house business committee to decide what gets debated every week in the Commons, has never been implemented. Ministers, who currently decide Commons business for themselves (apart from on days like today) considered the idea too radical. In February 2010, when MPs debated the Wright reforms, Cash backed them strongly. Speaking during an intervention, he said Serious consideration should be given to whether the executive should control the standing orders ... We should return to the practice when parliament was really vibrant, as a former clerk of the house clearly indicated in a recent article, and that the Speaker, not the executive, should have control over the standing orders. And in his main speech he said: The independence of the backbencher is absolutely fundamental to the working of the house. That is why I appreciate, and will vote for, the proposals in the report. In my evidence to the committee, I described the working of parliament as a sham. A great deal of it is a sham, because so much of its work is driven by decisions that are taken outside parliament ... About 150 years ago, there were only about four standing orders; in fact, they were not standing orders but Speaker\u2019s rules. There are now between 160 and 170 standing orders, which have been imposed by the executive through what is effectively an elective dictatorship. The powers and freedoms of back benchers are being restricted by the imposition of more and more standing orders. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, is speaking in the debate now. He says the Letwin procedure, allowing MPs to take control of the government business on any given day, is a \u201cconstitutional revolution\u201d. He says standing order 14, saying government business should take precedence, is important. Governments are elected, and they are accountable to the voters, he says. He says Britain operates on the basis of parliamentary government, not government by parliament. Gareth Snell, the Labour MP who is more sympathetic to Brexit than many of his colleagues, says Letwin should explain what he wants to use Wednesday\u2019s business for. He says Letwin is \u201cdaisy-chaining\u201d every time he gets on of these debates \u2013 adding a clause taking control of the Commons business for one further day in the future. He says Letwin should tell MPs what his plans are, and for how long this will go on. Sir Edward Leigh, the Tory Brexiter, says the business motion debate might be the most interesting part of the day because procedure has become all-important. He says tonight MPs will probably whittle the options down to one, with a majority, the customs union plan. He says Oliver Letwin will then produce a bill obliging the government to do this. Letwin is seen shaking his head. Leigh says the Commons is on the cusp of losing control, and seeing MPs vote for a permanent customs union. He says MPs should vote for the PM\u2019s deal instead. MPs are now debating the business motion for the indicative votes process. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, told MPs that the government would be voting against it, because it was opposed in principle to the idea of the government having to cede control of the Commons business. As well as setting out the arrangements for today\u2019s debate, the business motion (which is on the order paper), says Wednesday should be set aside for indicative votes business, not for government business. In the Commons the Tory Brexiter Richard Drax has just used a point of order to make a personal statement. Drax voted for the PM\u2019s withdrawal agreement on Friday, having voted against it at the first meaningful vote (MV1) and MV2. But, he told MP, on reflection he realised he had \u201cnot been true to myself\u201d. He said that he wished he had not voted for the deal, and that he regretted letting down the DUP. He also said he hopes that John Bercow, the Speaker, would not allow the government to bring the deal back for a fourth vote. Bercow responded by saying that he did not know what Drax was going to say when he called him, but that Drax was a \u201cperson of integrity\u201d and a \u201cman of principle\u201d. On Thursday Bercow said that one of the reasons why it was wrong to let the government hold repeat votes on the same issue was because it meant MPs having to repeatedly face the same difficult decisions. His comments about Drax this afternoon will be seen as further evidence that he takes this argument seriously. UPDATE: Here is some video of Drax speaking. George Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor who now edits the Evening Standard, thinks that there will soon be an election or a referendum. In the editor\u2019s reply slot in the Evening Standard, he tells a reader: I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re astounded. The MPs have been unable to come up with a successful exit plan from the EU because there isn\u2019t one. We can refuse to acknowledge the trade-offs between sovereignty, prosperity and security \u2013 and then blame the politicians for failing to deliver an impossible task. Or we can, as a country, face the truth that all forms of Brexit make Britain poorer, less secure and less influential. If that\u2019s the price the majority of the public is willing to pay then, fine, we\u2019re a democracy. It looks like they\u2019ll soon get a chance to have their say in an election or referendum. These are from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. These are from the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope. Nick Boles, the Conservative MP who has tabled the common market 2.0 amendment, has welcomed Labour\u2019s decision to whip in favour of it. These are from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn. Theresa May\u2019s warring cabinet ministers will once again be instructed to boycott Monday night\u2019s indicative votes, as MPs make a second attempt to coalesce around an alternative to her Brexit deal, my colleague Heather Stewart reports. Labour has confirmed that, if the common market 2.0 amendment is selected, it will whip its MPs to vote in favour. Commons market 2.0 is now the preferred way of describing what used to be called Norway plus. That suggests the party is shifting its stance towards staying in the single market, and accepting free movement, as Emily Thornberry was hinting earlier (see 2.12pm), although it will be important to see what clarifications are offered from the front bench during the debate. (Remember, last week the party backed the Beckett/second referendum amendment, while saying publicly it did not agree with every aspect of what it was proposing.) Commenting on today\u2019s votes, a party spokesman said: In line with our policy, we\u2019re supporting motions to keep options on the table to prevent a damaging Tory deal or no deal, build consensus across the house to break the deadlock and deliver an outcome that can work for the whole country. More on Labour and the single market. (See 2.12pm.) These are from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, gave a hint on the World at One that Labour is relaxing its opposition to the UK remaining in the EU\u2019s single market after Brexit. Until now the party has called for the UK to remain aligned to the single market, but not a full member like Norway, partly on the grounds that single market membership would involve the UK accepting free movement. But last week Labour encouraged its MPs to back the common market 2.0 plan in the first round of indicative votes on Wednesday, without formally whipping in favour. The plan was defeated, but 143 of Labour\u2019s 245 MPs voted in favour. Common market 2.0 would involve the UK staying in the single market, and having a customs union arrangement with the EU. Effectively it is the same as what is known as Norway plus. Thornberry said she did not know exactly how Labour would whip on the plan today, but she said it encouraged its MPs to back the plan last Wednesday, and that the same would happen again. She stressed the need for compromise. We find ourselves at the 11th hour, or perhaps the 59th minute of the 11th hour, trying to pull something together because of the manifest failure of the government. And people need to compromise. And when asked if that meant Labour was now willing to accept freedom of movement, she replied: What we are trying to do is trying to pull the House of Commons together, and what we are trying to do that will get maximum support, because we don\u2019t accept Theresa May\u2019s deal and we don\u2019t want no deal. So we are trying to do that. The presenter, Sarah Montague, said Thornberry seemed to be saying yes without saying yes. The Tory Brexiter Steve Baker, who was one of the 34 Conservative MPs who voted against Theresa May\u2019s Brexit agreement on Friday, has suggested that he would resign the party whip and vote with Labour against the government in a confidence motion if May came out in favour of the UK staying in the customs union. Some ministers, like the justice secretary David Gauke, are actively pushing for this as a resolution to the Brexit crisis, on the grounds that a majority of MPs might back May\u2019s Brexit deal if it were tied to a customs union (Labour\u2019s policy). But Baker, who is deputy chairman of the European Research Group, which represents the Tories pushing for a harder Brexit, told the BBC\u2019s Politics Live (not to be confused with the real thing) that this would \u201cshatter\u201d the Conservative party. He said: I think it would really shatter the party. I\u2019ve said that before. I\u2019m not sure what would happen ... It would be a clear breach of our manifesto promises. It would leave us heading into a position where, instead of taking back control, we had surrendered more control. I think that across the country there would be furious anger, and in particular in the Conservative party ... I think what is at stake now is democracy for everyone. When people vote, does that vote count for anything? Because if we don\u2019t leave the European Union, having asked the public to decide, then the very legitimacy of democracy is on the table. Asked what would happen if May did embrace the customs union idea, Baker replied: I\u2019m hoping not to reach that point. As a Conservative member of parliament, I would expect always to vote with the government in a confidence motion. But, when pressed, he went on: At this point I can foresee no circumstances while, as a Conservative MP, I voted against the government in a confidence motion. But we are approaching the point where the stakes are now so very high, and so transcend party politics and what this country is about, and the fundamental British value that political power rests on consent, that I think these things are coming onto the table. Baker was clearly referring to the possibility that he could resign the Tory whip to vote against the government in a confidence motion. Any vote of this kind would involve Baker voting with Labour even though Labour is committed to keeping the UK in the customs union for good. That sounds illogical, but Baker might be working on the assumption that losing a confidence vote could lead to May being replaced as PM by a Tory Brexiter, or that a confidence vote would stop the government legislating for a customs union Brexit, leading to the UK dropping out of the EU with no deal. Baker\u2019s vote on its own would not make a difference. But almost 30 ERG Tories feel about as strongly about this as Baker, and if just half of them were to join him in voting with Labour in a confidence motion, they could bring down May. A few months ago Nick Boles, another Tory, suggested that he was willing to vote against the PM in a confidence motion for the opposite reason \u2013 to stop a no-deal Brexit. At the time Anna Soubry said she would be willing to join him in this, but since then she has left the party anyway to join the Independent Group. The SNP will vote for the common market 2.0 option tonight if it is put to a vote, the BBC\u2019s Liz Rawlings reports. Last week the SNP abstained on common market 2.0, which was defeated by a majority of 94. The German government says it wants to allow British citizens to travel to Germany without a visa even in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In a five-page letter sent to Germany\u2019s federal states at the end of last week, the country\u2019s interior ministry endorsed EU proposals to allow Brits to enter the Schengen area visa-free when making short trips. The proposal, which is designed as a guideline for administrations in Germany\u2019s 16 states, refrained from offering advice on how to treat Britons visiting for longer periods. Britons already based in Germany would have to apply for a residence permit if the country crashed out of the EU without a deal, the letter stated. However, the interior ministry advised federal states to automatically guarantee residency rights to Britons during a transition period, and announced plans for a law that would make it easier for British pensioners or low earners to meet the requirements for a permit. I\u2019m just back from the No10 lobby briefing. It would be wrong to pretend that we came away with any great insights into Theresa May\u2019s Brexit strategy for this week, but there were a few clues. Downing Street refused to say when or if May would bring her withdrawal agreement back to the Commons for a fourth vote this week. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said a motion would have to go down on the order paper the day before a vote, implying that tomorrow has been ruled out as an option. (The indicative votes results won\u2019t be announced until around 10pm tonight, and No 10 wants to see the outcome of that debate before deciding what to do next.) The spokesman would not say whether the government was planning to get MPs to vote on the withdrawal agreement again by incorporating it into the EU withdrawal agreement bill, and getting MPs to vote on that this week, or whether it was planning to offer MPs a choice between May\u2019s deal and the winner of the indicative votes process, but reporters were left with the impression that the second option was more probable. The spokesman implicitly rejected the chief whip\u2019s claim that the government should have been clearer after the 2017 general election about the need to go for a softer Brexit. Stressing that he did not accept the term softer Brexit, the spokesman said May had repeatedly stressed the need to bring the country together in the Brexit process. The spokesman also refused to say whether the PM accepted Julian Smith\u2019s claim that May\u2019s ministers had displayed the \u201cworst example of ill discipline in cabinet in British political history\u201d. That was a judgment for historians, the spokesman said. The spokesman appeared to rule out the idea of proroguing parliament for a short period of time. Some MPs have floated this as a possibility, either to stop MPs legislating to stop a no-deal Brexit, or to allow the government to sidestep the Speaker\u2019s ruling about not putting the same proposition to a vote twice in one parliamentary session. Referring to the possibility of parliament being prorogued, the spokesman said the government had \u201cno intention of involving the Queen\u201d in the process. The spokesman also played down suggestions that, if MPs were to legislate for a softer Brexit against the wishes of the PM, the government could ask the Queen not to grant the bill royal assent. The spokesman said he had not heard anyone suggest that idea. Downing Street played down prospects of the prime minister calling a general election, saying she did not believe that would be in the national interest. The spokesman refused to say how government MPs would be whipped to vote in the indicative votes debate this afternoon. The spokesman responded to claims from the head of Siemens in the UK that Brexit has turned the country into a laughing stock (see 10.05am) by saying that the PM understood that business wanted certainty and that she was working hard to get MPs to back her deal. But the spokesman would not respond to the comment from Germany\u2019s Europe minister about Brexit being a \u201cbig shitshow\u201d. (See 10.30am.) Chuka Umunna, the former Labour MP who is now the spokesman for the Independent Group of MPs, told Sky\u2019s All Out Politics this morning that his group was in favour of amendments calling for a second referendum. He said the Independent Group voted against the customs union plan in the first indicative votes debate last week. He explained: Our view is, this has got to go back to the people ... Ultimately the best deal that is available to the UK is the one we currently have now. We think people should have the option to choose that. A customs union, or even a single market model, come nowhere close to what our existing deal does for the British economy. I\u2019m off to the No 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am. Steve Baker, the deputy chairman of the European Research Group and one of the hardline Brexiters who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal on Friday, has posted a thread on Twitter dismissing claims that the Brexiters have refused to compromise since 2016. He was responding to Julian Smith, the chief whip, telling the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg in an interview for her Brexit documentary that the government should have pushed for a softer Brexit after the 2017 election. Bloomberg have filed a story on the comments from the German deputy foreign minister, Michael Roth. The Reuters intro is worth quoting in full. European exasperation over the chaos in Brexit talks descended into profanity and name-calling, as Germany\u2019s deputy foreign minister said the UK government consists mostly of clueless boarding-school graduates. And here are the key points. Roth described Brexit as \u201ca big shitshow\u201d. Speaking at a Social Democratic party event in Berlin on Saturday, he said: Brexit is a big shitshow, I say that now very undiplomatically ... I don\u2019t know if William Shakespeare could have come up with such a tragedy, but who will foot the bill? Roth dismissed the UK cabinet as members of an out-of-touch elite. He said 90% of the cabinet had \u201cno idea how workers think, live, work and behave\u201d and that it would not be these politicians \u201cborn with silver spoons in their mouths, who went to private schools and elite universities\u201d who would suffer from Brexit. This is from Sky\u2019s Darren McCaffrey. I will post more on this when I can find a fuller version of the quotes. The UK chief of the German manufacturing group Siemens also said Brexit was turning Britain into a laughing stock, my colleague Graeme Wearden reports. In an open letter published on Politico, J\u00fcrgen Maier said the political rows and deadlock over Brexit were wrecking the UK\u2019s reputation for business stability. Maier said: Brexit is exhausting our business and wrecking the country\u2019s tremendous reputation as an economic powerhouse. The UK\u2019s historic stable political climate has facilitated huge investments from companies like Siemens over the years, and we are at risk of losing that critical pillar of economic stability. I know this view is held by many of my colleagues leading businesses here too ... The world is watching, and where the UK used to be a beacon for stability, we are now becoming a laughing stock. I personally can no longer defend the action of our parliament when reporting to my managing board, making it hard to win support for finely balanced investment decisions that in the end have an impact on UK jobs, innovation and the competitiveness of our activities here. Good morning. We\u2019ve got the second indicative votes debate late (IV2) and those MPs pushing for a softer Brexit will be hoping that there is a majority for an alternative approach, such as the plan for a customs union championed by the Tory pro-European Ken Clarke. Here is my colleague Rajeev Syal\u2019s overnight round-up of yesterday\u2019s developments on Brexit. And here is a guide to the possible options that could be put to a vote this evening. But this morning cabinet Brexiters have been restating their opposition to the idea of the government ever backing a customs union, even if a majority of MPs were in favour. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph (paywall) Chris Grayling, a leading figure in the leave campaign, said being in a customs union with the EU would allow a country like Lithuania to have more influence over UK trade policy than the UK itself (because Lithuania is one of the EU member states deciding EU trade policy, which the UK would have to accept). Grayling told the paper: Are we really going to accept the situation where the government of Lithuania has more power over our trading relationship with the Commonwealth than our government does? That is the reality of the customs union. And this morning Liz Truss, who voted to remain in 2016 but now favours leaving, told the Today programme she did not think a customs union was the way forward. She told the programme: It\u2019s not clear to me that going softer is the way to command support. If you look at the parliamentary arithmetic now, it\u2019s not clear that something like a customs union actually commands support. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Sajid Javid, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 3.30pm: MPs begin debating the business motion for the indicative votes debate. That could run until 6pm. MPs will then start the proper debate, which will run until 8pm. 4.30pm: MPs hold a debate in Westminster Hall on the petition calling for article 50 to be revoked. There won\u2019t be a vote. 8pm: MPs vote on the indicative votes proposals selected by the Speaker. They will be voting on paper. The results will be announced at some point after 9.30pm. Today I will be focusing exclusively on Brexit and, as usual, I will be covering the breaking news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cBelieve in Britain\u201d, say leavers\u2019 posters outside parliament. What sort of belief, as things fall apart? While Brexit voting consumed Westminster last Friday, another austerity tragedy slipped by unnoticed. In Hastings the doors shut for the last time on a day centre that was life support, comfort and company for 60 old people. I met Rose, Mary and Sal, who had sat together for years, and were now to be separated. Some of those ejected from the Isabel Blackman Centre will stay home alone. Some will soon go to expensive residential care, in the absence of the centre\u2019s daily respite for their partners. Expect many to be in A&amp;E more often, along with others of the 1.8 million older people denied care. Some 54,000 older people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/06/age-uk-50000-elderly-have-died-waiting-for-social-care-package\" title=\"\">died waiting for a care package</a> last year, according to Age UK. In East Sussex seven local care centres have shut. The council is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/03/local-council-funding-crisis-east-sussex-cuts-services\" title=\"\">near bankrupt</a>, due to cuts. As the Isabel Blackman Centre shut, the new minister for loneliness, Tracey Crouch, was not there to say goodbye to Rose, Mary and Sal.</p> <p>I left to catch the train back for the next episode of the Westminster psycho-drama, to see the MPs consumed by the furies, ambitions and panics of another Brexit vote. These things are linked. \u201cBelieve in Britain\u201d? The real patriotic cause is to save us all from Brexit, from the damage any variety of Brexit will do, as the grip of austerity inevitably tightens following departure. Closing day centres wasn\u2019t on the side of that notorious leave bus, of course.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many fear that a referendum will just be too divisive, but there\u2019s no other peaceful resolution on offer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Comforting talk of \u201ccompromise\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d Brexit is everywhere. But don\u2019t be lulled into hoping for any such thing: there is no \u201cmiddle way\u201d; out is out. Don\u2019t be soothed by the thought that a customs union would be better than the prime minister\u2019s hard red lines. Don\u2019t listen to the siren calls for customs union combined with single market membership. Closer ties of this kind, of course, feel better to remainers, but it\u2019s a delusion to imagine they ease the path ahead. Because they don\u2019t, unless confirmed by a public vote.</p> <p>Consider the future with realism: peace will not break out if a softened Brexit is hauled over the line by a bullied Commons majority. Remember what comes next: in short order we shall have a Brexiteering prime minister selected by a handful of Tory party members in shires and suburbs. He \u2013 it will be a he \u2013 will negotiate the real trade deal aiming for the hardest possible Brexit denouement. If the withdrawal deal eventually included the customs union, this new leader, along with his Brexit paratroopers and the pro-Brexit press would fight against it at every opportunity. Every time a new edict emerges from Brussels over which we had no say, they will lie about it, misrepresent it and stir up anti-EU fever.</p> <p>Coming soon is an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/29/eu-bans-widely-used-pesticide-over-safety-concerns\" title=\"\">EU ban on the pesticide chlorothalonil</a>: farmers are already protesting. Vassalage! Brexiters will side with farmers or anyone unhappy with any EU rule. Watch them campaign to cut all final ties, escape the Brussels \u201cyoke\u201d and regulations over which we have no say. And unfortunately, given our new lack of political influence in Brussels, they will have a point.</p> <p>Obsessive Brexiters will never give up. Fear of that intransigence has made some remainers too ready to compromise. Remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/27/brexit-latest-news-live-debate-indicative-votes--to-vote-on-alternative-votes-as-speculation-mounts-may-could-announce-plans-to-quit-live-news?page=with:block-5c9be548e4b0347f70e74e28#block-5c9be548e4b0347f70e74e28\" title=\"\">160 of them voted</a> before for a no-deal outcome, despite EU warnings that there\u2019s no such thing as an \u201corderly\u201d no deal. These MPs know it would mean lorry queues, empty-shelf panic-buying and a medicines crisis. Even worse, it would mean the UK unilaterally breaking an international treaty, the Good Friday agreement, by causing a hard border. We would become a rogue state defaulting on our debts. The Brexiters cleverly call this a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/04/lie-clean-break-brexit-politicians-britain\" title=\"\">clean Brexit</a>\u201d, but it\u2019s a very dirty one; an insanely irresponsible dash for an illusory pure Brexit. The jubilation of Trump and Putin would know no bounds. But if fear of that is what makes some choose compromise, be reassured no deal can\u2019t happen. Enough sensible MPs crossing every party line will do whatever it takes, including, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/16/david-gauke-expresses-grave-concerns-about-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">David Gauke</a> suggests, bringing down their own government to stop it.</p> <p>Nor should the lure of compromise tempt Labour into becoming the Brexit enabler: it will pay a high price if it backs any Brexit without the support of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/31/labour-may-call-fresh-vote-of-no-confidence-in-theresa-may\" title=\"\">public vote</a>. A soft Brexit stitched up in parliament will only prolong the culture war. Only the public can finally end the Brexit mania, but the choice put to voters must be fair. If the choice is only a \u201csoft\u201d customs union or remain, there would be a mighty stink from the leavers. Theresa May\u2019s deal may not be hard enough for them, but it\u2019s certainly not soft: the ballot paper choice must be her deal or remain.</p> <p>It\u2019s true that those supporting a people\u2019s vote may be too sanguine in their hopes of remain winning a referendum. Analysts such as Prof Robert Ford are raining on their parade. While his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/mar/30/how-do-brexit-voters-feel-about-the-eu-now\" title=\"\">polling suggests a move towards remain</a>, now 54:46 ahead, he finds few changing their minds. He describes remain support as \u201cnarrow and fragile\u201d, relying on abstainers turning out, while campaign \u201csymbols, slogans and slip-ups\u201d could swing the outcome either way.</p> <p>Many fear that a referendum will just be too divisive, but there\u2019s no other peaceful resolution on offer. Both sides will fight on without it. If the customs union version is put to the vote, the risk is that voters choose it as a fictitious \u201ccompromise\u201d, making Brexit more likely. Yet most bad effects of Brexit will still follow, with a final trade deal that could be as hard as Canadian rocks. Moreover, the customs union only covers goods \u2013 20% of our economy, not the remaining <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/europe/uk-eu-trade/\" title=\"\">80% bound up in services</a>. Above all, a customs union Brexit will leave the angry Brexiters banging on about vassalage forever.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/01/jeremy-corbyn-labour-peoples-vote-fight-far-right\">Jeremy Corbyn needs to get behind the people\u2019s vote to fight the far right | Rachel Shabi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is no compromising with Brexiters. Only the public can end the debate, either choosing an actual Brexit deal laid before them, or coming to the conclusion that there is no deal better than the one we have. The mood music of a pro-EU campaign needs to reflect the warmth of our neighbours, the affection they have shown in making it as easy as they can for us to stay, despite the hordes of Faragist bores and boors we sent to abuse them daily in the European parliament. As for prospective Euro-elections in May, don\u2019t fear them but seize the chance to send better neighbours to Brussels this time.</p> <p>And afterwards, if we remain, don\u2019t let another good crisis go to waste. We wasted the 2008 crash by \u201cspaffing cash up the wall\u201d of banks instead of economy-building with Keynesian state spending. There are good crisis lessons to take from this Brexit fiasco: building up regional power and finance; taking social injustice seriously; civilising Westminster by opening its doors with proportional representation. Don\u2019t let go of the new sovereignty parliament has won from the over-mighty executive \u2013 and warmly embrace and promote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/31/michael-heseltine-britain-stepping-down-world-pre-eminence\" title=\"\">the good the European Union brings us</a>.</p> <p>The doors slamming shut on that day centre in Hastings felt like a symbol, a signal and a warning. If Brexit happens, under a Brextreme prime minister, there will be a lot more of that and little of the kind of politics that could make us \u201cBelieve in Britain\u201d. This is not the moment to wobble and compromise: any Brexit is a bad Brexit and it can still be stopped.</p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Closer ties of this kind, of course, feel better to remainers, but it\u2019s a delusion to imagine they ease the path ahead. Because they don\u2019t, unless confirmed by a public vote. Consider the future with realism: peace will not break out if a softened Brexit is hauled over the line by a bullied Commons majority. Remember what comes next: in short order we shall have a Brexiteering prime minister selected by a handful of Tory party members in shires and suburbs. He \u2013 it will be a he \u2013 will negotiate the real trade deal aiming for the hardest possible Brexit denouement. If the withdrawal deal eventually included the customs union, this new leader, along with his Brexit paratroopers and the pro-Brexit press would fight against it at every opportunity. Every time a new edict emerges from Brussels over which we had no say, they will lie about it, misrepresent it and stir up anti-EU fever. Coming soon is an EU ban on the pesticide chlorothalonil: farmers are already protesting. Vassalage! Brexiters will side with farmers or anyone unhappy with any EU rule. Watch them campaign to cut all final ties, escape the Brussels \u201cyoke\u201d and regulations over which we have no say. And unfortunately, given our new lack of political influence in Brussels, they will have a point. Obsessive Brexiters will never give up. Fear of that intransigence has made some remainers too ready to compromise. Remember 160 of them voted before for a no-deal outcome, despite EU warnings that there\u2019s no such thing as an \u201corderly\u201d no deal. These MPs know it would mean lorry queues, empty-shelf panic-buying and a medicines crisis. Even worse, it would mean the UK unilaterally breaking an international treaty, the Good Friday agreement, by causing a hard border. We would become a rogue state defaulting on our debts. The Brexiters cleverly call this a \u201cclean Brexit\u201d, but it\u2019s a very dirty one; an insanely irresponsible dash for an illusory pure Brexit. The jubilation of Trump and Putin would know no bounds. But if fear of that is what makes some choose compromise, be reassured no deal can\u2019t happen. Enough sensible MPs crossing every party line will do whatever it takes, including, as David Gauke suggests, bringing down their own government to stop it. Nor should the lure of compromise tempt Labour into becoming the Brexit enabler: it will pay a high price if it backs any Brexit without the support of a public vote. A soft Brexit stitched up in parliament will only prolong the culture war. Only the public can finally end the Brexit mania, but the choice put to voters must be fair. If the choice is only a \u201csoft\u201d customs union or remain, there would be a mighty stink from the leavers. Theresa May\u2019s deal may not be hard enough for them, but it\u2019s certainly not soft: the ballot paper choice must be her deal or remain. It\u2019s true that those supporting a people\u2019s vote may be too sanguine in their hopes of remain winning a referendum. Analysts such as Prof Robert Ford are raining on their parade. While his polling suggests a move towards remain, now 54:46 ahead, he finds few changing their minds. He describes remain support as \u201cnarrow and fragile\u201d, relying on abstainers turning out, while campaign \u201csymbols, slogans and slip-ups\u201d could swing the outcome either way. Many fear that a referendum will just be too divisive, but there\u2019s no other peaceful resolution on offer. Both sides will fight on without it. If the customs union version is put to the vote, the risk is that voters choose it as a fictitious \u201ccompromise\u201d, making Brexit more likely. Yet most bad effects of Brexit will still follow, with a final trade deal that could be as hard as Canadian rocks. Moreover, the customs union only covers goods \u2013 20% of our economy, not the remaining 80% bound up in services. Above all, a customs union Brexit will leave the angry Brexiters banging on about vassalage forever. There is no compromising with Brexiters. Only the public can end the debate, either choosing an actual Brexit deal laid before them, or coming to the conclusion that there is no deal better than the one we have. The mood music of a pro-EU campaign needs to reflect the warmth of our neighbours, the affection they have shown in making it as easy as they can for us to stay, despite the hordes of Faragist bores and boors we sent to abuse them daily in the European parliament. As for prospective Euro-elections in May, don\u2019t fear them but seize the chance to send better neighbours to Brussels this time. And afterwards, if we remain, don\u2019t let another good crisis go to waste. We wasted the 2008 crash by \u201cspaffing cash up the wall\u201d of banks instead of economy-building with Keynesian state spending. There are good crisis lessons to take from this Brexit fiasco: building up regional power and finance; taking social injustice seriously; civilising Westminster by opening its doors with proportional representation. Don\u2019t let go of the new sovereignty parliament has won from the over-mighty executive \u2013 and warmly embrace and promote the good the European Union brings us. The doors slamming shut on that day centre in Hastings felt like a symbol, a signal and a warning. If Brexit happens, under a Brextreme prime minister, there will be a lot more of that and little of the kind of politics that could make us \u201cBelieve in Britain\u201d. This is not the moment to wobble and compromise: any Brexit is a bad Brexit and it can still be stopped. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Semi-naked climate change protesters interrupted a House of Commons Brexit debate and glued their hands to the glass of the public gallery, spending almost 20 minutes with their buttocks facing the chamber. MPs attempted to continue the debate during the peaceful protest by 11 activists from Extinction Rebellion, though several made coded mentions to the protest in their speeches. Protesters had slogans daubed on their chests, including \u201cfor all life\u201d and \u201cSOS\u201d and two more wore grey body paint and elephant masks, which the group said referred to climate change as \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d. Police cleared the public gallery in the House of Commons and then removed the protesters individually, some of whom were carried out by officers. The police later said 12 people had been arrested \u201cfor outraging public decency\u201d. The protest began during a speech by the Labour MP Peter Kyle, who was arguing in favour of his motion to add a confirmatory Brexit referendum. The Tory MP Justine Greening congratulated Kyle for \u201cfleshing out his arguments very well indeed\u201d and Kyle in turn thanked the Conservative MP Steve Brine for a \u201ccheeky intervention\u201d. The Conservative Nick Boles congratulated Kyle for delivering his speech \u201cwith a certain amount of distraction\u201d and quipped that many of his Tory colleagues appeared to be missing from the benches around him including \u201ca noted naturist\u201d. Boles was referring to the Brexiter MP Bernard Jenkin \u2013 who enjoys nudism as a private hobby. In a point of order, the Conservative MP Nigel Evans said the House of Commons had dealt well with \u201ca distraction, not a disruption to our proceedings\u201d and thanked thanked police and Commons officials. The Speaker, John Bercow, also thanked officials after the protesters were removed. \u201cWe just press on with the debate, that is what we are here to do,\u201d he said, to cheers in the chamber. In a statement after the protest, one of the activists, Mark Ovland, said climate change was being \u201cflagrantly and recklessly ignored by our government and media\u201d and the group wanted to draw attention to the crisis during the debate on Brexit. \u201cBy undressing in parliament, we are putting ourselves in an incredibly vulnerable position, highlighting the vulnerability that all of us share in the face of environmental and societal breakdown,\u201d he said.

During the 1960s and 70s there was a realisation that junior doctors\u2019 hours were not acceptable and some progress was made to deal with the problem: we are now seeing a return to the bad old days. John Hurdley (Consultant anaesthetist, retired thank God), Birmingham \u2022 We owe our gratitude and thanks to Dr Joanna Poole for compiling and submitting her dossier of over 400 accounts of \u201cpetty tortures\u201d that our colleagues have endured in their work environments. Although these accounts are shocking, they are sadly not surprising. We stand in support of all colleagues today who wish to speak out about any mistreatment they have suffered in order to provide patient care. We share concerns that these issues occur in hospital-based settings, and also in primary care. There are colleagues from all levels of seniority: trainees, salaried doctors and partners who anonymously voice concerns about culture and working conditions. Such accounts are not surprising. As a system, we are at breaking point and the numbers speak for themselves. We are saddened by the volume of evidence that has been collected to date about the culture of bullying, inhumane treatment and disrespect for humanity that permeates throughout the NHS in both primary and secondary care. More is being done to promote and drive wellbeing initiatives, but without serious culture change we risk potentiating the recruitment and retention crisis. We will support any colleagues who wish to come forward, either to share with us their story or who are in need of support. We are your college and we will endeavour to work for you. Dr A Sen Mukherjee Wellbeing lead, First5 committee, Royal College of GPs \u2022 Your report on the treatment of trainee doctors describes treatment of employees that amounts to a serious breach of the employer\u2019s duty under section 2 of the Health and Safety at Work Act (HSWA). In other workplaces, less serious breaches than those described lead to enforcement action by the HSE, including prosecutions of serious or repeat offenders, because breach of these duties is a criminal offence. If the NHS regulators lack the power to enforce HSWA, they should call on the HSE or the police to act on their behalf, before someone dies through their inaction.

At a time when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/16/hate-crime-brexit-terrorist-attacks-england-wales\" title=\"\">hate crime</a> against all minority communities is rising, and when far-right extremism is a growing problem, they simply must not be allowed to get away with it.</p> \n<p>Just over two weeks ago, people around the world were left heartbroken and scared when 50 innocent people were murdered in a terrorist attack in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/christchurch-shooting\" title=\"\">Christchurch, New Zealand</a>, for no reason other than their faith.</p> \n<p>This horrific attack was motivated by Islamophobia and anti-Muslim sentiment. But, sadly, these views are no longer held by extremists alone. Over recent years, they have crept into mainstream society and political debate. Everyone who cares about protecting our diversity and liberal, inclusive societies must act immediately to stamp it out.</p> \n<p>There is no denying that here in Britain the Conservative party has a particular problem with Islamophobia. Just last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/24/tory-islamophobia-row-15-suspended-councillors-quietly-reinstated\" title=\"\">15 suspended Conservative councillors</a> were quietly reinstated, despite evidence showing they had posted or shared Islamophobic or racist material.

It sends a message that it is totally acceptable to mock women who wear a burqa, and that blatantly anti-Muslim racist abuse deserves a slap on the wrist at most.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May and the Conservative party are refusing to take the action needed to tackle the growing problem of Islamophobia and anti-Muslim sentiment among Tory members and politicians, and in our wider society. At a time when hate crime against all minority communities is rising, and when far-right extremism is a growing problem, they simply must not be allowed to get away with it. Just over two weeks ago, people around the world were left heartbroken and scared when 50 innocent people were murdered in a terrorist attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, for no reason other than their faith. This horrific attack was motivated by Islamophobia and anti-Muslim sentiment. But, sadly, these views are no longer held by extremists alone. Over recent years, they have crept into mainstream society and political debate. Everyone who cares about protecting our diversity and liberal, inclusive societies must act immediately to stamp it out. There is no denying that here in Britain the Conservative party has a particular problem with Islamophobia. Just last week, 15 suspended Conservative councillors were quietly reinstated, despite evidence showing they had posted or shared Islamophobic or racist material. And, in December, a Conservative party complaints panel found that Boris Johnson\u2019s comparison of women wearing burqas to letterboxes and bank robbers had been \u201crespectful\u201d. The impact this has on ordinary British Muslims cannot be overstated. It sends a message that it is totally acceptable to mock women who wear a burqa, and that blatantly anti-Muslim racist abuse deserves a slap on the wrist at most. It has left communities across Britain feeling insecure and afraid of what the future might hold. I have personally been subjected to abuse based on my faith by people at all levels of the Conservative party. Several Conservative members and councillors have been suspended or arrested or have faced legal action as a result of Islamophobic abuse directed at me, and I have never received an explanation let alone an apology for the openly Islamophobic campaign the party ran against me in London in 2016.

      "body": "<p>Last week, under a process unique in a thousand years of parliamentary history, MPs had the opportunity to discover \u201cthe will of parliament\u201d. Today it will be repeated. Instead of voting to decide between mutually exclusive proposals on Brexit, MPs had a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/alternative-brexit-options-what-will-john-bercow-select-for-indicative-votes\" title=\"\">series of indicative votes</a>.</p> <p>It was supposed to break the deadlock by allowing MPs to say not only what they wanted, but what they would be prepared to accept when it comes to Brexit. Most rational people had long since realised that the prime minister\u2019s deal would not get a majority. So the idea was that indicative votes actually gave MPs the opportunity to secure a majority for something, but only if they honestly voted for all the proposals that they could accept, instead of only voting for the one or two proposals that they most wanted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2019/mar/27/how-did-your-mp-vote-in-the-indicative-votes\">How did your MP vote in the indicative votes?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I found the experience refreshing. Normally I am clear beforehand about which single proposal in a binary choice I am going to vote for. With the indicative votes I had the chance to vote for lots of things. I didn\u2019t have to rank them in order, I just had to say whether I could live with them. Anything I really could not accept, I could vote against. During the course of the debate I found myself changing my decision. I had originally decided to vote against the European Economic Area with a customs union proposal. It respects the referendum technically by leaving the EU, and it delivers the benefits of a customs union, but the membership of the single market means we would not have control over money, borders and laws in a way that most people who voted to leave would find unacceptable. But my colleague <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2019/01/lucy-powell-common-market-2-0-can-break-the-brexit-deadlock/\" title=\"\">Lucy Powell</a> MP made an excellent speech that made me realise that even though I did not favour it, I could live with it. So I changed my decision and did not vote against. I treated the indicative process as a mechanism to deliver an outcome that most of us could live with.</p> <p>Looking at the way many other MPs actually voted, that now seems almost touchingly naive. What I did not expect was that some people would vote against positions they actually supported in order to game the system and try to get their number one choice to the top of the list. I, of course, knew Anna Soubry\u2019s top option was to have a second referendum. She does not want to leave the EU and wants to reverse the result of the referendum so of course I expected her to vote to have a second referendum on any deal and to revoke article 50. That is fair and proper. What I had not expected was that she would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2019/mar/27/how-did-your-mp-vote-in-the-indicative-votes#table\" title=\"\">vote against</a> the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/alternative-brexit-options-what-will-john-bercow-select-for-indicative-votes\" title=\"\">Clarke/Benn amendment</a> on a customs union. She and many of her colleagues in the Independent Group are on the record as supporting a customs union, indeed they were signatories to the customs union <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2018/jul/17/did-your-mp-back-the-customs-union-amendment-new-clause-18\" title=\"\">amendments to the trade bill</a> and the customs bill. They did not even abstain. They voted against something they had always previously supported. The public may wonder if some old scores were being settled or whether tribal loyalties were preventing some MPs from voting for options they might have favoured if only they had been put forward by a different source.</p> <p>On the whole I believe Labour MPs came out of the process with great credit. They entered into the spirit of the indicative process and were prepared to vote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2019/mar/27/how-did-your-mp-vote-in-the-indicative-votes#table\" title=\"\">in favour of more options</a> than any other political party or group. Personally I emerged as less amenable than most of my Labour colleagues (only voting in favour of three options and abstaining on two). But on average Labour MPs were willing to vote for four or five options out of the eight available. </p> <p>The most astonishing fact of the indicative vote process however, is how difficult Conservatives found it to vote in favour of anything at all.

      "bodyText": "Last week, under a process unique in a thousand years of parliamentary history, MPs had the opportunity to discover \u201cthe will of parliament\u201d. Today it will be repeated. Instead of voting to decide between mutually exclusive proposals on Brexit, MPs had a series of indicative votes. It was supposed to break the deadlock by allowing MPs to say not only what they wanted, but what they would be prepared to accept when it comes to Brexit. Most rational people had long since realised that the prime minister\u2019s deal would not get a majority. So the idea was that indicative votes actually gave MPs the opportunity to secure a majority for something, but only if they honestly voted for all the proposals that they could accept, instead of only voting for the one or two proposals that they most wanted. I found the experience refreshing. Normally I am clear beforehand about which single proposal in a binary choice I am going to vote for. With the indicative votes I had the chance to vote for lots of things. I didn\u2019t have to rank them in order, I just had to say whether I could live with them. Anything I really could not accept, I could vote against. During the course of the debate I found myself changing my decision. I had originally decided to vote against the European Economic Area with a customs union proposal. It respects the referendum technically by leaving the EU, and it delivers the benefits of a customs union, but the membership of the single market means we would not have control over money, borders and laws in a way that most people who voted to leave would find unacceptable. But my colleague Lucy Powell MP made an excellent speech that made me realise that even though I did not favour it, I could live with it. So I changed my decision and did not vote against. I treated the indicative process as a mechanism to deliver an outcome that most of us could live with. Looking at the way many other MPs actually voted, that now seems almost touchingly naive. What I did not expect was that some people would vote against positions they actually supported in order to game the system and try to get their number one choice to the top of the list. I, of course, knew Anna Soubry\u2019s top option was to have a second referendum. She does not want to leave the EU and wants to reverse the result of the referendum so of course I expected her to vote to have a second referendum on any deal and to revoke article 50. That is fair and proper. What I had not expected was that she would vote against the Clarke/Benn amendment on a customs union. She and many of her colleagues in the Independent Group are on the record as supporting a customs union, indeed they were signatories to the customs union amendments to the trade bill and the customs bill. They did not even abstain. They voted against something they had always previously supported. The public may wonder if some old scores were being settled or whether tribal loyalties were preventing some MPs from voting for options they might have favoured if only they had been put forward by a different source. On the whole I believe Labour MPs came out of the process with great credit. They entered into the spirit of the indicative process and were prepared to vote in favour of more options than any other political party or group. Personally I emerged as less amenable than most of my Labour colleagues (only voting in favour of three options and abstaining on two). But on average Labour MPs were willing to vote for four or five options out of the eight available. The most astonishing fact of the indicative vote process however, is how difficult Conservatives found it to vote in favour of anything at all. On the Guardian spreadsheet the Conservative MPs can be easily identified by the sea of red \u201cagainsts\u201d next to their names. On average Conservatives voted against six or seven options out of the eight available, with very few abstentions. Some, such as Mel Stride and Charles Walker, could not find it in themselves even to abstain on a single option, but voted against all eight. Surely the public had a right to expect better? This was supposed to be a process in which MPs placed the interest of the country first. Where they said yes to all the things they could accept in a spirit of reasonable compromise. For some MPs it appears to have turned into a high-stakes exercise in games theory. We did not find out \u201cthe will of parliament\u201d \u2013 what we found instead was the wilfulness of MPs. If parliament is to find a path through the Brexit mess today, then MPs need to stop playing the system, pay no attention to the names or parties of the proposer and seconders and ask themselves honestly \u201cCould I bear to put up with this sort of deal?\u201d Then and only then might we reclaim the right to call ourselves representatives of the will of the people. \u2022 Barry Gardiner is shadow secretary of state for international trade, energy and climate change.
