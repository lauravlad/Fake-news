Germany may say it has been resolved but what counts is international law.\u201d</p> <p>Greeks suffered hugely at the hands of Hitler\u2019s forces, enduring what Germany\u2019s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, recently described on a visit to Greece as \u201cunimaginable\u201d horrors.</p> <p>Tens of thousands were killed in reprisals as Greeks mounted what historians would later hail as a heroic resistance against the Wehrmacht [Nazi armed forces], with entire villages being wiped out between 1941 and 1944.</p> <p>By the time the occupation ended, an estimated 300,000 people had died from famine and the country\u2019s Jewish community had been almost entirely obliterated.</p> <p>The prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has raised the issue more persistently than any other to date.</p> <p>Despite criticism of political opportunism as European polls near, Greek MPs this week backed a resolution calling for the government to pursue demands for \u20ac300bn in damages following debate on the findings of an all-inclusive parliamentary inquiry into the German occupation. The findings have been described as the first complete reading of Nazi atrocities in Greece.</p> <p>In its report \u2013 compiled after in-depth research of records obtained from US national archives and Russia \u2013 the cross-party committee estimated that \u20ac11bn was owed for an interest-free \u201coccupation loan\u201d forcibly extracted by German forces.</p> <p>Gold holdings, seized from the country\u2019s central bank in 1943, were used to fund Germany\u2019s campaign in north Africa. A further \u20ac288bn, it said, remained outstanding for the destruction Greece sustained during the war.</p> <p>Berlin has long argued that recompense was delivered when, under a bilateral accord, it paid Athens DM115m in 1960.</p> <p>But addressing the Greek parliament, Sia Anagnostopoulou, the minister who will be heading the compensation campaign, described the reimbursement as inadequate.</p> <p>\u201cThe agreement did not take into account the occupation loan or reparations \u2026 they concerned individuals, victims of the Nazis,\u201d she said, adding that the Netherlands had received a much greater sum despite having \u201cone-hundredth\u201d of the total number of victims of Greece.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an issue here with the German people and the German government with whom we are friend and allies, and we must not forget that.\u201d</p> <p>Leftist MPs have long claimed that Greece\u2019s brutal wartime experience delayed its development as a modern European state.</p> <p>The issue of war crimes reignited with renewed passion with the eruption of Greece\u2019s debt crisis in late 2009 when Germany, as Europe\u2019s paymaster, imposed punishing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/28/greece-moves-towards-ending-austerity-with-rise-to-minimum-wage\">austerity measures </a>as the price of emergency loans to keep the insolvent country afloat.</p> <p>At its height, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was depicted in Greece in Nazi garb, wearing a swastika armband, with many Greeks drawing comparisons to the time when they lost sovereignty under Nazi rule.</p> <p>Although Tsipras has since tempered his rhetoric, forging visibly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/10/angela-merkel-on-victory-tour-visit-to-athens\">warm relations with the German leader</a>, the question of war debt is likely to gain traction as Greece gears up for general elections later this year.</p> <p>Prior to Athens exiting its third and final bailout last summer, officials say it would have been \u201cnonsensical\u201d to have raised the issue.</p> <p>Indicative of the emotions Nazi-era crimes are still prone to elicit, within hours of the vote in the Greek parliament, the MP in charge of Warsaw\u2019s reparations campaign announced that Poland should follow suit.</p> <p>Greek compensation claims pale by comparison. Warsaw was razed to the ground by the Nazis after an abortive uprising in which 200,000 civilians died. The lives of 6 million Poles \u2013 including 3 million Polish Jews \u2013 were lost. Poland, which also faces parliamentary elections this year, has since demanded \u20ac800bn in war debts it insists it is still owed by Germany.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 22 April 2019. Due to an editing error an earlier version incorrectly translated Wehrmacht as \u201cGerman army\u201d.</p>",

Germany may say it has been resolved but what counts is international law.\u201d Greeks suffered hugely at the hands of Hitler\u2019s forces, enduring what Germany\u2019s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, recently described on a visit to Greece as \u201cunimaginable\u201d horrors. Tens of thousands were killed in reprisals as Greeks mounted what historians would later hail as a heroic resistance against the Wehrmacht [Nazi armed forces], with entire villages being wiped out between 1941 and 1944. By the time the occupation ended, an estimated 300,000 people had died from famine and the country\u2019s Jewish community had been almost entirely obliterated. The prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has raised the issue more persistently than any other to date. Despite criticism of political opportunism as European polls near, Greek MPs this week backed a resolution calling for the government to pursue demands for \u20ac300bn in damages following debate on the findings of an all-inclusive parliamentary inquiry into the German occupation. The findings have been described as the first complete reading of Nazi atrocities in Greece. In its report \u2013 compiled after in-depth research of records obtained from US national archives and Russia \u2013 the cross-party committee estimated that \u20ac11bn was owed for an interest-free \u201coccupation loan\u201d forcibly extracted by German forces. Gold holdings, seized from the country\u2019s central bank in 1943, were used to fund Germany\u2019s campaign in north Africa. A further \u20ac288bn, it said, remained outstanding for the destruction Greece sustained during the war. Berlin has long argued that recompense was delivered when, under a bilateral accord, it paid Athens DM115m in 1960. But addressing the Greek parliament, Sia Anagnostopoulou, the minister who will be heading the compensation campaign, described the reimbursement as inadequate. \u201cThe agreement did not take into account the occupation loan or reparations \u2026 they concerned individuals, victims of the Nazis,\u201d she said, adding that the Netherlands had received a much greater sum despite having \u201cone-hundredth\u201d of the total number of victims of Greece. \u201cThere is an issue here with the German people and the German government with whom we are friend and allies, and we must not forget that.\u201d Leftist MPs have long claimed that Greece\u2019s brutal wartime experience delayed its development as a modern European state. The issue of war crimes reignited with renewed passion with the eruption of Greece\u2019s debt crisis in late 2009 when Germany, as Europe\u2019s paymaster, imposed punishing austerity measures as the price of emergency loans to keep the insolvent country afloat. At its height, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was depicted in Greece in Nazi garb, wearing a swastika armband, with many Greeks drawing comparisons to the time when they lost sovereignty under Nazi rule. Although Tsipras has since tempered his rhetoric, forging visibly warm relations with the German leader, the question of war debt is likely to gain traction as Greece gears up for general elections later this year. Prior to Athens exiting its third and final bailout last summer, officials say it would have been \u201cnonsensical\u201d to have raised the issue. Indicative of the emotions Nazi-era crimes are still prone to elicit, within hours of the vote in the Greek parliament, the MP in charge of Warsaw\u2019s reparations campaign announced that Poland should follow suit. Greek compensation claims pale by comparison. Warsaw was razed to the ground by the Nazis after an abortive uprising in which 200,000 civilians died. The lives of 6 million Poles \u2013 including 3 million Polish Jews \u2013 were lost. Poland, which also faces parliamentary elections this year, has since demanded \u20ac800bn in war debts it insists it is still owed by Germany. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 April 2019. Due to an editing error an earlier version incorrectly translated Wehrmacht as \u201cGerman army\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>We can all list our favourite reasons why the Brexit promised in the pale dawn sunlight of June 2016 has not turned out to be a walk in the park or even a final date with EU destiny. But whatever we now think of the outcome of the referendum, we are all trapped in the old Indian saying about the banyan tree \u2013 under its shade little new can grow. Sometimes, I miss my role writing about politics of the kind that was not just about meaningful(ish) votes, all-or-nothing dates leading to the next cliff edge, scoldings from EU leaders, and whether Theresa May is on her way out, only to be there the next week and off on another walking holiday.</p> <p>One day political archaeologists will dig into the frozen tundra and find the remains of government activity preserved under the permafrost. It might well start with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/hs2\" title=\"\">HS2</a>, which was once a glorious project slashing commuting times to Birmingham, with vague promises of what it might achieve for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/the-northerner/2013/jul/04/hs2-high-speed-rail-benefits-the-north\" title=\"\">the North</a>\u201d. (Westminster has a terminology as inexact as Narnia for areas outside the south-east.) Now, unnoticed by all but high-speed train-spotters, the project\u2019s completion cost, date, capacity, speed and even where it should terminate in London are in question. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/05/sir-terry-morgan-resigns-as-chairman-of-crossrail-and-hs2\" title=\"\">Sir Terry Morgan</a>, the outgone chairman, has described the price tag as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.building.co.uk/news/nobody-knows-how-much-hs2-will-cost-admits-ousted-chair/5097485.article\" title=\"\">guesstimate</a>\u201d. New sums suggest the cost might rise from \u00a356bn to nearly twice that amount, before we add on trains and power costs.</p> <p>Overseeing vast infrastructure projects on the taxpayers\u2019 behalf is the bread and butter of government \u2013 and yet they feel peripheral to the daily slog of Brexitology. A minister at the heart of the fray describes the effect on politicians as \u201cliving with hyper stimulation\u201d \u2013 unable to catch breath or resources to deal with anything that is not to do with avoiding backstops, meeting deadline dates and keeping up with parliamentary procedure.</p> <p>Few prizes await those who bash on with tricky projects, try to streamline clunky civil service operations or pursue an unpopular argument with colleagues to make an idea better (or, as in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/25/grayling-accused-of-trying-to-hold-brexit-ferry-trial-in-private\" title=\"\">Chris Grayling Brexit ferries fiasco</a>, fend off the worst).</p> <p>Occasionally, something urgent forces its way onto the agenda, most recently the spike in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/knifecrime\" title=\"\">knife crime</a>. On this subject, May and the home secretary, Sajid Javid, have had some sensible stuff to say. Both back the view of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/05/met-police-chief-cressida-dick-violent-knife-crime-officer-cuts-linked\" title=\"\">Cressida Dick</a>, the shrewd chief of the Met, who has looked closely at what allows violent street crime to thrive in some parts of London and be better controlled in others. She believes that a judicious use of stop and search is warranted, but that it is by no means the full story in reducing stabbings. The government\u2019s stance is evolving from an over-reliance on tough, instant measures to the recognition, as May herself put it at a recent knife-crime summit, that \u201cwe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/02/kentish-town-stabbing-investigation-after-man-killed\" title=\"\">cannot simply arrest ourselves</a> out of this problem\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0054a820a6940fbaa3c318f59bad96376cb62407\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0054a820a6940fbaa3c318f59bad96376cb62407/167_47_2793_1676/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The universities minister Chris Skidmore is striving to give military veterans and care-givers better access to higher education\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The universities minister Chris Skidmore is striving to give military veterans and care-givers better access to higher education.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Javid picked up the theme in his \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/15/sajid-javid-i-could-have-had-a-life-of-crime\" title=\"\">it could have been me</a>\u201d speech on delinquency. It was eloquent and, in essence, a pitch for more support from the backbenches against the bigger rolling leadership bandwagon of the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and self-exiled Brexiter, Boris Johnson. But any shift in approach to serious matters loses traction as political attention shifts back to how to fight European elections that were never meant to take place.

      "bodyText": "We can all list our favourite reasons why the Brexit promised in the pale dawn sunlight of June 2016 has not turned out to be a walk in the park or even a final date with EU destiny. But whatever we now think of the outcome of the referendum, we are all trapped in the old Indian saying about the banyan tree \u2013 under its shade little new can grow. Sometimes, I miss my role writing about politics of the kind that was not just about meaningful(ish) votes, all-or-nothing dates leading to the next cliff edge, scoldings from EU leaders, and whether Theresa May is on her way out, only to be there the next week and off on another walking holiday. One day political archaeologists will dig into the frozen tundra and find the remains of government activity preserved under the permafrost. It might well start with HS2, which was once a glorious project slashing commuting times to Birmingham, with vague promises of what it might achieve for \u201cthe North\u201d. (Westminster has a terminology as inexact as Narnia for areas outside the south-east.) Now, unnoticed by all but high-speed train-spotters, the project\u2019s completion cost, date, capacity, speed and even where it should terminate in London are in question. Sir Terry Morgan, the outgone chairman, has described the price tag as a \u201cguesstimate\u201d. New sums suggest the cost might rise from \u00a356bn to nearly twice that amount, before we add on trains and power costs. Overseeing vast infrastructure projects on the taxpayers\u2019 behalf is the bread and butter of government \u2013 and yet they feel peripheral to the daily slog of Brexitology. A minister at the heart of the fray describes the effect on politicians as \u201cliving with hyper stimulation\u201d \u2013 unable to catch breath or resources to deal with anything that is not to do with avoiding backstops, meeting deadline dates and keeping up with parliamentary procedure. Few prizes await those who bash on with tricky projects, try to streamline clunky civil service operations or pursue an unpopular argument with colleagues to make an idea better (or, as in the Chris Grayling Brexit ferries fiasco, fend off the worst). Occasionally, something urgent forces its way onto the agenda, most recently the spike in knife crime. On this subject, May and the home secretary, Sajid Javid, have had some sensible stuff to say. Both back the view of Cressida Dick, the shrewd chief of the Met, who has looked closely at what allows violent street crime to thrive in some parts of London and be better controlled in others. She believes that a judicious use of stop and search is warranted, but that it is by no means the full story in reducing stabbings. The government\u2019s stance is evolving from an over-reliance on tough, instant measures to the recognition, as May herself put it at a recent knife-crime summit, that \u201cwe cannot simply arrest ourselves out of this problem\u201d. Javid picked up the theme in his \u201cit could have been me\u201d speech on delinquency. It was eloquent and, in essence, a pitch for more support from the backbenches against the bigger rolling leadership bandwagon of the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and self-exiled Brexiter, Boris Johnson. But any shift in approach to serious matters loses traction as political attention shifts back to how to fight European elections that were never meant to take place. If this is the case for subjects of this salience, imagine the sheer desuetude of policy areas that are not always front of mind but which affect huge numbers of lives. When I bumped into Chris Skidmore, the amiable universities minister, he looked pretty amazed that anyone outside the sector was interested in his thinking on the day job, rather than the next vote in the Commons or May\u2019s longevity.

So long as they are identified mainly by where they stand on Brexit, how they voted in the last battles of attrition over indicative votes (which are, we should remember, not binding on the government, let alone on the EU\u2019s negotiators), the less reason they have to get interested in deep reforms or fresh ideas. The other victim of this situation is May herself, reduced to the role of single-issue PM. Did she mean to attend to the \u201cburning injustices\u201d in society she highlighted in her 2018 conference speech?

Part of the problem is that the conditions for fruitful public debate involve many elements, some of which may seem contradictory: a willingness to be robust in one\u2019s critique while also being charitable in interpreting our opponents; refusing to portray opponents as simply \u201cevil, pernicious and wicked\u201d while also not ignoring that which is so; being committed to free speech but also to a kind of speech that allows debate to flourish. Balancing such elements, especially in societies as polarised and fragmented as ours, is difficult. I am not so sanctimonious as to imagine that I often don\u2019t fail to do so myself, or that I don\u2019t fall into tribal thinking. But for all of us, such failure only makes urgent the need to view debate not as a means of eliciting outrage but as a process that might change minds. Including one\u2019s own. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",
