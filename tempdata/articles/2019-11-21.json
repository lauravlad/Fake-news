      "bodyText": "The first ever election leaders\u2019 debate focusing on the climate crisis will be broadcast by Channel 4 next week, with the prime minister the only major party leader set to be absent. Channel 4 News said it was awaiting confirmation from Boris Johnson as to whether he would take part and could place an empty chair in the place of the PM if he declines to attend. The campaigners Possible \u2013 who have been pushing for a leaders\u2019 head-to-head on the climate emergency \u2013 said it was a historic moment which put global heating front and centre of the election campaign. Max Wakefield, the director of Possible, said: \u201cWith poll after poll showing huge demand for emergency action from the political parties this has to be our first climate election. \u201cIt\u2019s in the prime minister\u2019s hands to make this happen, show leadership on the defining issue of our time \u2013 and prove he\u2019s ready to take on the challenge if elected.\u201d Earlier this week leaders from all the main opposition parties wrote to Johnson urging him to take part in any televised debate on the environmental emergency before the election. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, the Scottish National party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, the Liberal Democrats leader, Jo Swinson, and the co-leaders of the Green party, Jonathan Bartley and Si\u00e2n Berry, argued that the public had a right to know what political leaders intended to do to avoid \u201cthe irreversible impacts of environmental breakdown\u201d. All have agreed to take part in next week\u2019s debate. In the letter they stated: \u201cThe climate and nature emergencies threaten everything we hold dear; the jobs we do, the health service we rely on, the houses we live in and the food that we grow and eat. The public are right to look to us, their politicians, for leadership. The ambition of our response must match the scale of the challenge.\u201d The Conservatives, whose environmental record was condemned by leading climate scientists and former government advisers this week, told Possible that Johnson would not participate because he did not want environmental issues to be \u201csiloed\u201d. The Tory party has been approached for comment. The idea of a televised climate debate has gained widespread support since it was launched by school strikers, students and pensioners\u2019 groups earlier this month. More than 500 scientists \u2013 including Sir David King, a key government adviser on the climate crisis until 2017 \u2013 have backed the plan. Beccy Speight, the RSPB\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe must have the opportunity to scrutinise those vying to be our next prime minister on how they will deliver action at the unprecedented scale required.\u201d In the past two weeks, the campaign has also received support from more than 70 organisations with a total membership of more than 10 million, including the Women\u2019s Institute, the National Trust and the National Education Union. And more than 188,000 people have signed a petition supporting Possible\u2019s campaign. The climate emergency has been forced up the political agenda in the past year as growing evidence of the crisis \u2013 from floods to wildfires, record temperatures to melting ice \u2013 has become impossible to ignore. In the UK, hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren have taken to the streets to demand action and Extinction Rebellion protests have brought large parts of London to a standstill.",

The Brexit party leader, a friend of the US president, is due to make the announcement in Westminster on Friday as his party launches its version of an election manifesto. Described as a \u201ccontract with the British people\u201d, the party\u2019s focus on the environment with the support of the US may be part of an attempt to broaden its appeal to voters beyond those looking to vote for a hard form of Brexit. Speaking to the Guardian, Farage said the UK should become the face of a worldwide UN initiative. \u201cThe UK should spearhead a global initiative at the United Nations to plant billions of trees around the world and I have every confidence Britain would get support from the American administration on this,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s true that an area the size of Devon and Cornwall is removed from the Amazon every year, then we have a lot of work to do \u2013 and quickly.\u201d Farage is also pledging to ensure Britain recycles all of its own waste and to make it illegal for it to be exported overseas to be burned, buried or dumped at sea.

Farage, who recently secured a rare interview with the US president on his LBC radio show, is said to be keen to work with Trump on pushing environmental policies. Farage\u2019s Brexit party has had a difficult start to the campaign after its formal offer to the Tories of an electoral alliance was rebuffed by Boris Johnson. After coming under pressure not to split the vote among those on the right and in favour of Brexit, Farage pulled out candidates in 317 Tory-won seats. He had hoped the government would give him a free shot at Labour-won seats in return, but this was also rejected by Johnson.

It was such an odd response to the scandal engulfing Prince Andrew \u2013 so stiff, so forelock-tugging, so initially lacking in sympathy towards the teenage girls abused by the prince\u2019s late friend Jeffrey Epstein \u2013 that it stuck in the mind long after the televised leaders\u2019 debate ended.

Frankly the foreign secretary\u2019s response on the BBC Breakfast Show on Wednesday that \u201cno one gives a toss\u201d indicates just how much scorn the Tory party has for both the concerns of the people of this country and the rule of law. The Twitter stunt was a deliberate attempt by the national campaign HQ of a political party to mislead the public and a clear breach of electoral law. I have written to the regulatory body, the Electoral Commission, to remind them that the action clearly breaches section 143 of the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act 2000 and have asked that they seek an assurance from the Tory party that it would not repeat the behaviour.

As Jeremy Corbyn was proud to state, this was the most radical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/labour-manifesto-to-slap-11bn-tax-on-oil-and-gas-firms-to-fund-green-plan\">Labour party manifesto</a> in years.</p> <p>One of the questions asked at the document\u2019s launch was if Labour wanted to turn the clock back to the 1970s. Actually, the inspiration was more Clement Attlee in 1945 than Tony Benn 30 years later. Labour\u2019s starting point, as at the end of the second world war, was that something has gone fundamentally wrong with free-market capitalism and only a socialist transformation can put things right.</p> <p>So, as in 1945, there were plans for a big expansion of the state\u2019s role, both through renationalisation and much tighter regulation of the way business operates.</p> <p>But Labour\u2019s <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/manifesto/\">manifesto </a>was not just a throwback to the days of the Berlin airlift and Ealing comedies; it had a modern populist twist. There was an attempt to draw a dividing line between the people and a corporate/financial/media-owning elite, between the billionaires and those struggling to get by, between the top 5% who will pay more income tax and the 95% who will get a whole bunch of things for free. Labour has learned some lessons from the rightwing populists: identify your enemies, channel anger at a rigged system, offer painless solutions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/21/labour-manifesto-election-corbyn\">Labour\u2019s electrifying manifesto should jolt this election into life | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The contrast between Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto and the platform on which Tony Blair fought and won the 1997 general election could hardly be starker. Under Blair, Labour accepted the broad thrust of market reforms introduced by the Conservatives in the previous 18 years. It used means testing to target financial support to those deemed to need it most. And it spent its first two years in office sticking to the Major government\u2019s tough spending plans because it thought economic credibility came first.</p> <p>Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, are in a completely different place. They want to break with the status quo rather than work within it. They favour universalism over means testing. They also don\u2019t accept their plans have to be given the thumbs up from the City before they can be implemented. If the plan for a radical transformation of the British economy works, as Corbyn and McDonnell are convinced it will, the credibility will follow.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s political strategy is clear: get the election debate off Brexit and on to ground where it is more comfortable: the pledge to raise the national minimum wage to \u00a310 an hour for everyone; the big increases in education spending; free personal care for the over-65s; the abolition of tuition fees and the reintroduction of student maintenance grants. Corbyn thinks that if he can neutralise Brexit, there is still time to close the opinion poll gap with the Tories.</p> <p>That\u2019s certainly what happened in 2017 when voters tired of hearing Theresa May parrot her \u201cstrong and stable\u201d mantra. The hope is that they will become equally weary this time of listening to Boris Johnson say: \u201cGet Brexit done.\u201d</p> <p>If it can get the campaign off Brexit, Labour thinks the public will be receptive to the sort of radical, and expensive, agenda it is proposing, providing the message is couched in the right way. </p> <p>Although there have been clear signs in recent years that voters are suffering from austerity fatigue, public trust in politicians is at a record low. To reassure a sceptical public that it can deliver on its promises, the manifesto was accompanied by a document detailing how its \u00a383bn of day-to-day spending increases would be matched pound for pound by tax increases.</p> <p>These costings are already coming under intense scrutiny. All parties fear the judgment of the Institute for Fiscal Studies when they unveil their manifestos and the response from the thinktank\u2019s director Paul Johnson was quick and damning: it was not credible to expect companies and the rich to foot the bill for such a big increase in the size of the state. </p> <p>Labour had a radical manifesto in 2017 and has an even more radical programme this time. The copycat behaviour of the Conservatives, including pledges to raise the minimum wage and abandon cuts in corporation tax to fund higher NHS spending, shows how Labour has moved the dial on austerity and the economy more generally. </p> <p>But Labour didn\u2019t win the last election and, as things stand ,is not on course to win this one. The next three weeks will see whether voters believe team Corbyn can painlessly deliver the changes they want to see.</p>",

One of the questions asked at the document\u2019s launch was if Labour wanted to turn the clock back to the 1970s. Actually, the inspiration was more Clement Attlee in 1945 than Tony Benn 30 years later. Labour\u2019s starting point, as at the end of the second world war, was that something has gone fundamentally wrong with free-market capitalism and only a socialist transformation can put things right. So, as in 1945, there were plans for a big expansion of the state\u2019s role, both through renationalisation and much tighter regulation of the way business operates. But Labour\u2019s manifesto was not just a throwback to the days of the Berlin airlift and Ealing comedies; it had a modern populist twist. There was an attempt to draw a dividing line between the people and a corporate/financial/media-owning elite, between the billionaires and those struggling to get by, between the top 5% who will pay more income tax and the 95% who will get a whole bunch of things for free. Labour has learned some lessons from the rightwing populists: identify your enemies, channel anger at a rigged system, offer painless solutions. The contrast between Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto and the platform on which Tony Blair fought and won the 1997 general election could hardly be starker. Under Blair, Labour accepted the broad thrust of market reforms introduced by the Conservatives in the previous 18 years. It used means testing to target financial support to those deemed to need it most. And it spent its first two years in office sticking to the Major government\u2019s tough spending plans because it thought economic credibility came first. Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, are in a completely different place. They want to break with the status quo rather than work within it. They favour universalism over means testing. They also don\u2019t accept their plans have to be given the thumbs up from the City before they can be implemented. If the plan for a radical transformation of the British economy works, as Corbyn and McDonnell are convinced it will, the credibility will follow. Labour\u2019s political strategy is clear: get the election debate off Brexit and on to ground where it is more comfortable: the pledge to raise the national minimum wage to \u00a310 an hour for everyone; the big increases in education spending; free personal care for the over-65s; the abolition of tuition fees and the reintroduction of student maintenance grants. Corbyn thinks that if he can neutralise Brexit, there is still time to close the opinion poll gap with the Tories. That\u2019s certainly what happened in 2017 when voters tired of hearing Theresa May parrot her \u201cstrong and stable\u201d mantra. The hope is that they will become equally weary this time of listening to Boris Johnson say: \u201cGet Brexit done.\u201d If it can get the campaign off Brexit, Labour thinks the public will be receptive to the sort of radical, and expensive, agenda it is proposing, providing the message is couched in the right way. Although there have been clear signs in recent years that voters are suffering from austerity fatigue, public trust in politicians is at a record low. To reassure a sceptical public that it can deliver on its promises, the manifesto was accompanied by a document detailing how its \u00a383bn of day-to-day spending increases would be matched pound for pound by tax increases. These costings are already coming under intense scrutiny. All parties fear the judgment of the Institute for Fiscal Studies when they unveil their manifestos and the response from the thinktank\u2019s director Paul Johnson was quick and damning: it was not credible to expect companies and the rich to foot the bill for such a big increase in the size of the state. Labour had a radical manifesto in 2017 and has an even more radical programme this time. The copycat behaviour of the Conservatives, including pledges to raise the minimum wage and abandon cuts in corporation tax to fund higher NHS spending, shows how Labour has moved the dial on austerity and the economy more generally. But Labour didn\u2019t win the last election and, as things stand ,is not on course to win this one. The next three weeks will see whether voters believe team Corbyn can painlessly deliver the changes they want to see.",

The crisis demands swift action, but it isn\u2019t right to load the costs of the climate emergency on to the nurse, the builder or the energy worker.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo a Labour government will ensure the big oil and gas corporations that profit from heating up our planet will shoulder and pay their fair share of the burden with a just transition tax.\u201d</p> \n<p>The windfall tax is one of the most striking policies in Labour\u2019s manifesto, and follows a string of significant announcements during the general election campaign, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/15/free-broadband-essential-uk-compete-john-mcdonnell-labour-policy-openreach\">Free broadband for all</a>, paid for by taxing tech multinationals and part-nationalising BT.</p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/20/labour-targets-renters-with-pledge-of-100000-council-houses-a-year\">A pledge to build 150,000 council and social homes</a> a year by the end of the parliament.</p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/11/labour-pledge-we-would-give-six-years-of-free-study-for-adults\">Six years of free training for adults</a> and 1,000 new Sure Start centres.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>With Boris Johnson pressing home the Tories\u2019 message that he will \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, Labour has been keen to shift the election debate to domestic policies \u2013 including its determination to tackle the climate crisis.</p> \n<p>Corbyn has also repeatedly underlined his determination to take on big business, deliberately putting himself on the side of \u201cthe many\u201d, against \u201cthe most powerful people in Britain\u201d.</p> \n<p>The proceeds of the new tax would go towards adapting the economy to tackle the climate crisis, including retraining workers from the oil and gas industries and investing in green technologies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-young-voters\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-young-voters&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-young-voters</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>As expected, Labour\u2019s migration policy is significantly less liberal than the open borders motion passed at its conference in Brighton.</p> \n<p>The relevant passage says: \u201cIf we remain in the EU, freedom of movement will continue. If we leave, it will be subject to negotiations, but we recognise the social and economic benefits that free movement has brought both in terms of EU citizens here and UK citizens abroad \u2013 and we will seek to protect those rights.\u201d</p> \n<p>Labour is also publishing a separate \u201cgrey book\u201d alongside its manifesto, to show how it will fund its promises.</p> \n<p>It detailed tax increases worth \u00a382bn a year. These would include a \u00a39bn a year tax on financial transactions \u2013 the buying and selling of shares.</p> \n<p>Higher earners would also face tax increases, with those paid more than \u00a380,000 subject to a 45p rate, and a new \u201csuper-rich\u201d rate of 50p for those earning more than \u00a3125,000.</p> \n<p>Many of the new costs will fall on business, with income from dividends and capital gains being taxed at the same rate of income, for example.</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s trade union supporters have insisted that its ambition of making progress towards net zero carbon emissions by 2030 must be backed by strong protection for workers \u2013 including the creation of 1 million jobs in green industries.</p> \n<p>The windfall tax may prove controversial in Scotland, where Labour faces a tough battle against the Scottish National party, and where many voters have long felt they never benefited sufficiently from the country\u2019s natural resources.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/21/tories-no-deal-brexit-plans-damage-uk-economy-oecd-eu\">UK growth will dip to 1% even if no-deal Brexit avoided, warns OECD</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The decision to focus the \u201cjust transition fund\u201d partly on retraining oil and gas workers appears to be aimed at assuaging some of those concerns.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has launched the most radical Labour manifesto in decades, promising an \u201cinvestment blitz\u201d that would leave no corner of the UK untouched and welcoming the hostility of billionaires, big business and dodgy landlords. Speaking at an upbeat event at Birmingham City University, where students and activists leaned over balconies adorned with banners setting out Labour\u2019s policies, Corbyn urged the public to vote for \u201chope\u201d at the general election in three weeks\u2019 time. At the centre of the manifesto, called It\u2019s Time for Real Change, is a large increase in public investment, funded by taxes on corporations and top earners. The Labour leader called it \u201ca manifesto full of popular policies that the political establishment has blocked for a generation\u201d, and it appeared significantly more radical than the party\u2019s 2017 programme. Corbyn insisted that, as Labour has promised in 2017, there would be no tax rises for 95% of earners, with only those on incomes of more than \u00a380,000 being affected. \u201cYou can have this plan for real change, because you don\u2019t need money to buy it: you just need a vote,\u201d he said. A Labour government would also give public sector workers a 5% pay rise next year, helping to offset the impact of the 1% pay cap that has been in place for several years, the manifesto says. One key revenue-raiser is an \u00a311bn windfall tax on oil and gas companies which would create a \u201cjust transition fund\u201d to help shift the UK towards a green economy without causing mass job losses. The one-off tax would be calculated according to an assessment of each firm\u2019s past contribution to the climate crisis, Labour said, and could be paid over a number of years. The total is 10 times the \u00a31.1bn the Treasury expects to raise from the oil and gas sector this year. Corbyn said: \u201cWe can no longer deny the climate emergency. We can see it all around us, as the recent floods in Yorkshire and the east Midlands have shown. We have no time to waste. The crisis demands swift action, but it isn\u2019t right to load the costs of the climate emergency on to the nurse, the builder or the energy worker. \u201cSo a Labour government will ensure the big oil and gas corporations that profit from heating up our planet will shoulder and pay their fair share of the burden with a just transition tax.\u201d The windfall tax is one of the most striking policies in Labour\u2019s manifesto, and follows a string of significant announcements during the general election campaign, including: Free broadband for all, paid for by taxing tech multinationals and part-nationalising BT. A pledge to build 150,000 council and social homes a year by the end of the parliament. Six years of free training for adults and 1,000 new Sure Start centres. With Boris Johnson pressing home the Tories\u2019 message that he will \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, Labour has been keen to shift the election debate to domestic policies \u2013 including its determination to tackle the climate crisis. Corbyn has also repeatedly underlined his determination to take on big business, deliberately putting himself on the side of \u201cthe many\u201d, against \u201cthe most powerful people in Britain\u201d. The proceeds of the new tax would go towards adapting the economy to tackle the climate crisis, including retraining workers from the oil and gas industries and investing in green technologies. As expected, Labour\u2019s migration policy is significantly less liberal than the open borders motion passed at its conference in Brighton. The relevant passage says: \u201cIf we remain in the EU, freedom of movement will continue. If we leave, it will be subject to negotiations, but we recognise the social and economic benefits that free movement has brought both in terms of EU citizens here and UK citizens abroad \u2013 and we will seek to protect those rights.\u201d Labour is also publishing a separate \u201cgrey book\u201d alongside its manifesto, to show how it will fund its promises. It detailed tax increases worth \u00a382bn a year. These would include a \u00a39bn a year tax on financial transactions \u2013 the buying and selling of shares. Higher earners would also face tax increases, with those paid more than \u00a380,000 subject to a 45p rate, and a new \u201csuper-rich\u201d rate of 50p for those earning more than \u00a3125,000. Many of the new costs will fall on business, with income from dividends and capital gains being taxed at the same rate of income, for example. Labour\u2019s trade union supporters have insisted that its ambition of making progress towards net zero carbon emissions by 2030 must be backed by strong protection for workers \u2013 including the creation of 1 million jobs in green industries. The windfall tax may prove controversial in Scotland, where Labour faces a tough battle against the Scottish National party, and where many voters have long felt they never benefited sufficiently from the country\u2019s natural resources. The decision to focus the \u201cjust transition fund\u201d partly on retraining oil and gas workers appears to be aimed at assuaging some of those concerns. Corbyn said: \u201cNorth Sea oil and gas workers have powered this country for decades, often working under dangerous conditions. We won\u2019t hang them out to dry.\u201d In 1997, the New Labour government imposed a windfall tax on utilities companies, which were perceived to have made excess profits in the years after privatisation. The proceeds were used to fund welfare-to-work policies. Labour said \u00a311bn was an estimate and the final figure would be based on an assessment of the cost of the retraining and investments in green technologies. Output from the North Sea peaked in 1999, but the industry is likely to argue that the tax would accelerate its decline.",

The fact that Corbyn represents a form of socialism that is anathema to almost all traditional labour voters, coupled with the general desire of most people, just to get on with their lives, free of politics, and the endless round of ego busting media dominated noise that represents political debate these days, and there is only one feasible outcome. A Tory landslide \u2013 and it will be Corbyn\u2019s fault. cominguproses \u2018A sorry mess of easy promises\u2019 In 2017 I thought Corbyn made a fair degree of sense and whilst I doubted the speed of change he wanted was deliverable his goals were laudable. Listening to his speech I can only hear a series of empty promises. Apparently Corbyn is either going to nationalise the Japanese owned car industry or set up a nationalised UK manufacturer from scratch. How else can he ensure electric cars are made in the UK? At the moment, all European models (apart from Minis) will be made in Europe (they\u2019ve never had a UK presence) to maximise economy of scale savings from supplying Europe wide. Honda has already declined to make electric cars in the UK, They prefer to do it in Japanese factories and take advantage of the declining EU/Japan import tariff. Whether Brexit happens or not, the UK isn\u2019t going to be a major site for electric powered cars. We don\u2019t even own any intellectual property. This is just a sorry mess of easy promises, which are undeliverable in the real world. Bickb21",

But British elections are regional and multi-party now, and there are plenty of swing constituencies in the London commuter belt where disgruntled voters have seized their chance to reshape Britain\u2019s government in the past \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/10/surrey-commuters-marginal-voters-election-tories-guildford\" title=\"\">may do so again</a> this time.</p> <p>Traditionally, when Labour wins a majority in parliament it wins seats in counties such as Hertfordshire, Essex and Kent. Tony Blair won <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Parliamentary_constituencies_in_Hertfordshire#Results\" title=\"\">five out of 11</a> in Hertfordshire in 1997. But in 2017, Labour did not win a single seat in the county. Only an exceptionally obdurate Labour optimist can expect Jeremy Corbyn to improve on that on 12 December.</p> <p>Yet plenty of these commuter-belt seats are up for grabs in 2019. That\u2019s especially true of the areas closer to London, where younger families have migrated from the metropolis over the years in search of better housing and a greener lifestyle while still commuting into the capital. Many also voted to remain in the EU. Among them were three seats that face important election contests: Beaconsfield, South West Hertfordshire and St Albans.</p> <p>Labour has no chance of winning any of the three. Beaconsfield and South West Hertfordshire are in play because their former Tory MPs, Dominic Grieve and Gauke, thrown out of the parliamentary party by Boris Johnson for opposing a hard Brexit, are running as independents, while St Albans is a major target seat for the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Daisy Cooper. Having spent time on the campaign trail in all three seats this week, I think it is clear that the official Tory candidates are genuinely under threat in all of them. But it is also clear that the Tories will not lose without determined and large-scale tactical voting.</p> <p>Right now, there is no common pattern. Yet uncertainty about how to make tactical voting work is widespread. This partly reflects the lack of information, which several websites and campaigns are now seeking to correct. But it also reflects a deeper cultural tension between the centre left and centre right, in which it is genuinely hard to persuade adherents of one tradition to vote tactically for the other, even though the substantive differences between them are sometimes small. Even among the reasonable and respectful voters whom Gauke invokes, tribal loyalties can be tenacious.</p> <p>Cooper knows this at first-hand better than most. The former campaigns director for Hacked Off was widely expected to take remain-backing St Albans for the Lib Dems in 2017 and to oust the Tory, Anne Main, a hardline leaver who narrowly survived a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8198888.stm\" title=\"\">deselection attempt</a> in 2009 after an expenses row. But Cooper <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Albans_(UK_Parliament_constituency)#Elections_in_the_2010s\" title=\"\">fell short on 32%</a>, largely because the Labour vote held up at 23%.</p> <p>On the doorstep with Cooper this week as she canvassed undecideds, it was hard to believe she will fail a second time. \u201cI\u2019m going to vote Lib Dem because I\u2019m a remainer,\u201d said Caroline, a former Labour supporter. This was a constant refrain. Stopping Brexit was by far the most common topic on the doorstep. If the Tories are to lose St Albans next month, Labour voters are going to have to vote for Cooper in greater numbers than they did two years ago.</p> <p>Round the M25 in the Buckinghamshire seat of Beaconsfield, Grieve\u2019s challenge is to persuade enough of the nearly 37,000 people who supported him as a Tory in 2017 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/09/dominic-grieve-campaign-trail-beaconsfield\" title=\"\">back him as an independent</a>. \u201cCorbyn is the bogeyman,\u201d Grieve told me. \u201cThere\u2019s an anxiety about somehow letting Labour come through and win.\u201d</p> <p>Judging by his reception from commuters outside Gerrards Cross station on the coldest morning of the year so far, however, plenty have overcome any such anxiety. Support for Grieve\u2019s anti-Brexit stand was overwhelming. \u201cThank you for your integrity,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a principled man,\u201d and \u201cI can finally vote for someone who puts the national interest first\u201d were just some of the accolades he received in the frosty dawn. \u201cAfter a session like that, I think we might just do it,\u201d Grieve told me later, over breakfast in a local cafe. He surely can.</p> <p>Grieve is helped by the fact that in Beaconsfield the Liberal Democrats have stood down and endorsed him. Up the road in South West Hertfordshire, Gauke is not so fortunate. His campaign has had to start from scratch. The word here is that the local Lib Dems were prepared to give Gauke a clear run but that Jo Swinson and the national leadership overruled them, partly on the grounds that they did not want to do too many deals with former Conservatives. In practice, though, there is no sign yet of a Lib Dem effort there, and Gauke gets a supportive reaction from shoppers in Berkhamsted. The former Labour MP for Barnsley East, Michael Dugher, who lives locally, is backing Gauke too.</p> <p>These are just three Conservative-held seats. Yet they stand for many others. Voters in such seats who want to stop Johnson from getting a majority, or who yearn for Britain to remain in Europe, have to get real about their options. If Labour cannot win these seats \u2013 and at present it cannot \u2013 then it is right to vote for the opponent with the best chance. This is not a time for political piety, prissiness or pride. It\u2019s about facing the Brexit danger \u2013 and taking the one real chance of preventing it.</p> <p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p>",

They want a better choice.\u201d It is often said that UK general elections are won and lost in the English Midlands. But British elections are regional and multi-party now, and there are plenty of swing constituencies in the London commuter belt where disgruntled voters have seized their chance to reshape Britain\u2019s government in the past \u2013 and may do so again this time. Traditionally, when Labour wins a majority in parliament it wins seats in counties such as Hertfordshire, Essex and Kent. Tony Blair won five out of 11 in Hertfordshire in 1997. But in 2017, Labour did not win a single seat in the county. Only an exceptionally obdurate Labour optimist can expect Jeremy Corbyn to improve on that on 12 December. Yet plenty of these commuter-belt seats are up for grabs in 2019. That\u2019s especially true of the areas closer to London, where younger families have migrated from the metropolis over the years in search of better housing and a greener lifestyle while still commuting into the capital. Many also voted to remain in the EU. Among them were three seats that face important election contests: Beaconsfield, South West Hertfordshire and St Albans. Labour has no chance of winning any of the three. Beaconsfield and South West Hertfordshire are in play because their former Tory MPs, Dominic Grieve and Gauke, thrown out of the parliamentary party by Boris Johnson for opposing a hard Brexit, are running as independents, while St Albans is a major target seat for the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Daisy Cooper. Having spent time on the campaign trail in all three seats this week, I think it is clear that the official Tory candidates are genuinely under threat in all of them. But it is also clear that the Tories will not lose without determined and large-scale tactical voting. Right now, there is no common pattern. Yet uncertainty about how to make tactical voting work is widespread. This partly reflects the lack of information, which several websites and campaigns are now seeking to correct. But it also reflects a deeper cultural tension between the centre left and centre right, in which it is genuinely hard to persuade adherents of one tradition to vote tactically for the other, even though the substantive differences between them are sometimes small. Even among the reasonable and respectful voters whom Gauke invokes, tribal loyalties can be tenacious. Cooper knows this at first-hand better than most. The former campaigns director for Hacked Off was widely expected to take remain-backing St Albans for the Lib Dems in 2017 and to oust the Tory, Anne Main, a hardline leaver who narrowly survived a deselection attempt in 2009 after an expenses row. But Cooper fell short on 32%, largely because the Labour vote held up at 23%. On the doorstep with Cooper this week as she canvassed undecideds, it was hard to believe she will fail a second time. \u201cI\u2019m going to vote Lib Dem because I\u2019m a remainer,\u201d said Caroline, a former Labour supporter. This was a constant refrain. Stopping Brexit was by far the most common topic on the doorstep. If the Tories are to lose St Albans next month, Labour voters are going to have to vote for Cooper in greater numbers than they did two years ago. Round the M25 in the Buckinghamshire seat of Beaconsfield, Grieve\u2019s challenge is to persuade enough of the nearly 37,000 people who supported him as a Tory in 2017 to back him as an independent. \u201cCorbyn is the bogeyman,\u201d Grieve told me. \u201cThere\u2019s an anxiety about somehow letting Labour come through and win.\u201d Judging by his reception from commuters outside Gerrards Cross station on the coldest morning of the year so far, however, plenty have overcome any such anxiety. Support for Grieve\u2019s anti-Brexit stand was overwhelming. \u201cThank you for your integrity,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a principled man,\u201d and \u201cI can finally vote for someone who puts the national interest first\u201d were just some of the accolades he received in the frosty dawn. \u201cAfter a session like that, I think we might just do it,\u201d Grieve told me later, over breakfast in a local cafe. He surely can. Grieve is helped by the fact that in Beaconsfield the Liberal Democrats have stood down and endorsed him. Up the road in South West Hertfordshire, Gauke is not so fortunate. His campaign has had to start from scratch. The word here is that the local Lib Dems were prepared to give Gauke a clear run but that Jo Swinson and the national leadership overruled them, partly on the grounds that they did not want to do too many deals with former Conservatives. In practice, though, there is no sign yet of a Lib Dem effort there, and Gauke gets a supportive reaction from shoppers in Berkhamsted. The former Labour MP for Barnsley East, Michael Dugher, who lives locally, is backing Gauke too. These are just three Conservative-held seats. Yet they stand for many others. Voters in such seats who want to stop Johnson from getting a majority, or who yearn for Britain to remain in Europe, have to get real about their options. If Labour cannot win these seats \u2013 and at present it cannot \u2013 then it is right to vote for the opponent with the best chance. This is not a time for political piety, prissiness or pride. It\u2019s about facing the Brexit danger \u2013 and taking the one real chance of preventing it. \u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist",
