      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson broke cover on Monday night, vowing he would never reveal the events that led to the police being called to the home of his partner Carrie Symonds last week, after neighbours reported a loud row between the couple. Amid mounting criticism that the frontrunner in the Conservative leadership campaign has been dodging public scrutiny, Johnson is now understood to be rolling out a \u201cmedia blitz\u201d for the coming days, beginning with five closely controlled events on Tuesday, in an attempt to defy accusations that he is in hiding. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, in his first televised interview since his campaign kicked off more than four weeks ago, a defiant Johnson said it would be \u201cunfair\u201d on his family to comment on his private life. \u201cI do not talk about stuff involving my family, my loved ones. And there\u2019s a very good reason for that. That is that, if you do, you drag them into things that, really is, is, in a way that is not fair on them,\u201d he said. Johnson refused to be drawn when accused by Kuenssberg of trying to \u201chave it both ways\u201d after multiple news outlets published a photograph on Monday of him and a smiling Symonds sitting in the Sussex countryside. His team denies the picture was set up and released by them. He defended his Brexit plan to renegotiate a deal with the European Union, but admitted he could not rip up the entire withdrawal agreement, something which some Conservative Eurosceptics have said they believed he was planning to do. Johnson claimed issues including the Irish border would be tackled \u201con the other side of 31 October during what\u2019s called the implementation period\u201d but then was forced to agree that the UK would not be entitled to such an implementation period without signing up to the current withdrawal agreement. His rival for the leadership, Jeremy Hunt, has called for Johnson to face further scrutiny on his Brexit plan and answer questions about the police visit to his home, calling him a \u201cbottler\u201d for refusing to attend a Sky News debate this week. Meanwhile, four Conservative party sources have told the Guardian that Johnson\u2019s campaign team had raised concerns about the extent of media access to the 16 Conservative hustings at a meeting on Friday. However, the party chairman, Brandon Lewis, insisted there must be a livestream of each event. The Guardian spoke to two sources present at the meeting who said objections had been raised by James Wharton, Johnson\u2019s campaign manager, about the media access to the hustings, including questioning why a pool camera had been invited to film proceedings. However, Johnson\u2019s team said they did not make any such demands, insisting all organisational aspects were a matter for Conservative campaign headquarters. A source close to Johnson said there was \u201cno objection from us about allowing media into the hustings \u2013 and of course they are invited to all\u201d. Wharton declined to comment. Another Conservative source said Johnson\u2019s campaign had objected to the media access arrangements for the hustings, but Lewis had insisted at the meeting that the hustings must be allowed to be broadcast and covered properly by the press. After Johnson said he would not take part in a planned Sky News debate with Hunt on Tuesday night, the channel cancelled the programme. It is understood Johnson declined to take part in Sky\u2019s debate because of terms agreed for an ITV debate next week, which the broadcaster has asked be the first head-to-head debate. However, Hunt\u2019s camp pointed out that Johnson had declined all television debates until Conservative members had already begun returning their ballot papers. \u201cBottler Boris and his complacent campaign have shown they can\u2019t trust their candidate to turn up and perform,\u201d a source close to Hunt\u2019s campaign said. A source in Johnson\u2019s team rebuffed claims the ITV debate would be taking place after Tory members had voted, calling it \u201cprime voting time\u201d for when members would be sending back their postal ballots. MP Marcus Fysh, one of Johnson\u2019s supporters, said Hunt\u2019s criticism was ridiculous: \u201cHe is certainly not a coward, as was said by his opponent today in a very negative way.\u201d Hunt also joined calls for Johnson to explain why police were called to his home, saying his rival \u201cneeds to show he can answer difficult questions\u201d. The intervention by the foreign secretary followed cabinet ministers, backbenchers and a major party donor in demanding Johnson speak out about the loud, late-night altercation with Carrie Symonds, which was heard by several neighbours. Police attended the property but left after receiving reassurances from both the individuals in the flat that they were safe. John Griffin, the taxi tycoon who has given \u00a34m to the Tories over the last six years, expressed concerns about the morality of the favourite to become prime minister. \u201cWe deserve an explanation about that row, and he has to handle it properly. He can\u2019t assume that we are going to support him when he has not explained every detail,\u201d he said. Griffin, a Brexiter and founder of Addison Lee, expressed concerns about Johnson\u2019s morality and said he should also come clean about his previous behaviour, including his responsibilities to his children. Johnson has four children by his estranged wife, Marina Wheeler, and a child with a woman with whom he had an affair. However, he has been dogged by unproven claims that he has at least one more child. Johnson has refused to comment. \u201cEach of his children need his love and attention. But he needs to show that he has given it to them. He cannot say that it is irrelevant. It is highly relevant. It is one of the ways you measure a person,\u201d Griffin said. Griffin called for Johnson to address allegations that he had had extramarital affairs and had treated women in those relationships badly. In a tweet on Monday, Hunt said: \u201cThis contest isn\u2019t about personal lives but if you want to lead this country you have to show up and answer questions on your plans for Britain.\u201d Hunt has made a raft of media appearances and spent Monday visiting businesses in the West Country. The foreign secretary, who secured the endorsement of defence secretary Penny Mordaunt, a Brexiter, will promise on Tuesday to create a \u00a315bn \u201cwar chest\u201d of spending on defence rising to 2.5% of GDP in the next five years, up from its current 2%. Hunt said it would show Britain was a \u201cself-confident country ready to defend its interests and values as we embark on an exciting post-Brexit future\u201d.",

He had been either invisible or deliberately sober to the point of dullness, when his usual primary draw to Tory members is a self-created sense of optimism and fun. Much is also made of his supposed broad appeal to the electorate, evidenced by two terms as London mayor.</p>\n    <p>His bizarre claim to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/mesmerising-boris-johnsons-bizarre-model-buses-claim-raises-eyebrows\">make model cardboard buses</a> has raised eyebrows. In most political contests, Johnson\u2019s character \u2013 he has lost more than one job for lying, and has a complex and opaque personal life \u2013 would be a big issue, but among the Tory faithful he seemingly receives a free pass. It remains to be seen what impact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/22/neighbour-who-called-police-over-boris-johnson-row-goes-public\">late-night police visit</a> will have on his chances.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has promised to push for a new deal while insisting the UK will leave the EU come what may on 31 October, even if it involves no deal. While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate, Johnson said only that it was 'eminently feasible', although he then went on to tell TalkRadio that the 31 October deadline was 'do or die'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members. Johnson\u2019s camp insist it would be part of a wider \u2013 and so far unknown \u2013 package of tax changes.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Public spending</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has said relatively little, beyond promising a fairly small increase in schools funding, as well as talking about the need to roll out fast broadband across the country. Johnson has generally hinted he would loosen the purse strings, but given his prior fondness for big-ticket projects \u2013 London\u2019s cancelled garden bridge, the mooted 'Boris island' airport \u2013 perhaps expect more of a focus on infrastructure projects than services.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Climate and environment</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is unlikely to be a big issue for Conservative party members, and Johnson has not said much on this beyond confirming his general support for the new government target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Foreign policy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Also unlikely to be a big issue among Tory members, beyond vague platitudes on 'global Britain', it could be a weak spot for Johnson given his poor performance as foreign secretary. He was seen as something of a joke by diplomats \u2013 both UK and foreign \u2013 and is likely to face more questioning over his gaffe about the jailed British-Iranian woman&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe\">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe</a></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterwalker\"><b>Peter Walker</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Political correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s tactic throughout the contest so far has been to keep out of the spotlight, reducing the risk of slip-ups. Instead of submitting himself to questions from journalists, proxies such as Priti Patel and Liz Truss have been dispatched to make the case for his Brexit policy for him, preventing the embarrassment of being directly asked questions about his character and instances where he has fallen short of the truth.</p> \n<p>The strategy is for the entire focus to be on his pledge to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October, pitching him as tougher on this issue than Jeremy Hunt to the highly Eurosceptic Tory selectorate.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/23/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnson-a-question-of-character\">The Guardian view on Boris Johnson: a question of character | Editorial</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There will be something of a shift now towards Johnson appearing more in the public eye, with stage-managed events and photo opportunities, now that he needs to cement his lead with the 160,000 Conservative members who make the final choice.</p> \n<p>However, the campaign\u2019s tactics of keeping Johnson on a tight leash remain unchanged, especially since the Guardian\u2019s revelation that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/21/police-called-to-loud-altercation-at-boris-johnsons-home\">police were called to a loud late-night altercation</a> between him and his partner, Carrie Symonds, last week. Police were called to the flat they share by concerned neighbours, but left after being reassured both individuals were safe.</p> \n<p>A mysterious photograph of Johnson sitting at a garden table in the Sussex countryside next to his smiling girlfriend emerged on Monday, which his campaign team deny was set up and released by them. But so far, he has refused to comment on the incident itself, saying party members do not want to know about \u201cthat sort of thing\u201d.</p> \n<p>While the campaign is keen to address Hunt\u2019s accusation that Johnson is a \u201cbottler\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/23/boris-johnson-faces-growing-pressure-to-comment-on-row-with-partner\">afraid of being grilled by hostile journalists</a>, there is an overriding desire to prevent further furores that could erode his commanding lead over the next four weeks.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"23caf334-d396-4f7e-85b3-af46137a6e37\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p><strong>Personal style</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His style is notably technocratic, with few rhetorical flourishes and an emphasis on his consensual approach and long record as a minister, notably during more than five years as health secretary, a traditional graveyard of ministerial careers. Hunt\u2019s attempts to talk up a backstory as an 'underestimated' entrepreneur can fall flat given he is also the son of an admiral and was head boy at Charterhouse.

      "bodyText": "The Boris Johnson submarine is starting to surface, according to his campaign team, after weeks beneath the radar dodging debates and refusing television interviews. They claim a \u201cmedia blitz\u201d is about to start that will see Johnson become much more visible with four weeks to go until he potentially enters No 10 as prime minister. On Monday night the BBC broadcast his first TV interview of his campaign, although many of his answers to Laura Kuenssberg were the same as those he gave to similar questions at his launch four weeks ago. He will attend at least five campaign events in London and Surrey on Tuesday, including an afternoon tea, door-knocking and a speech to 200 members at a horticultural society. But will the general media be allowed to come along? It is not an open invitation. Johnson\u2019s tactic throughout the contest so far has been to keep out of the spotlight, reducing the risk of slip-ups. Instead of submitting himself to questions from journalists, proxies such as Priti Patel and Liz Truss have been dispatched to make the case for his Brexit policy for him, preventing the embarrassment of being directly asked questions about his character and instances where he has fallen short of the truth. The strategy is for the entire focus to be on his pledge to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October, pitching him as tougher on this issue than Jeremy Hunt to the highly Eurosceptic Tory selectorate. There will be something of a shift now towards Johnson appearing more in the public eye, with stage-managed events and photo opportunities, now that he needs to cement his lead with the 160,000 Conservative members who make the final choice. However, the campaign\u2019s tactics of keeping Johnson on a tight leash remain unchanged, especially since the Guardian\u2019s revelation that the police were called to a loud late-night altercation between him and his partner, Carrie Symonds, last week. Police were called to the flat they share by concerned neighbours, but left after being reassured both individuals were safe. A mysterious photograph of Johnson sitting at a garden table in the Sussex countryside next to his smiling girlfriend emerged on Monday, which his campaign team deny was set up and released by them. But so far, he has refused to comment on the incident itself, saying party members do not want to know about \u201cthat sort of thing\u201d. While the campaign is keen to address Hunt\u2019s accusation that Johnson is a \u201cbottler\u201d afraid of being grilled by hostile journalists, there is an overriding desire to prevent further furores that could erode his commanding lead over the next four weeks. One veteran Conservative strategist who has worked on several past leadership campaigns said Johnson\u2019s low-profile strategy \u2013 advised unofficially by election guru Lynton Crosby \u2013 was the right one if he wanted to ensure he got to No 10. \u201cThere is no perfect formula but as a rule of thumb, if you\u2019re the frontrunner, you minimise the risks,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would you take risks if you are leading \u2013 in Boris\u2019s case by the best part of two to one with the voters? The electorate of 160,000 are split mostly in favour of a no-deal Brexit so in this situation he needs to not drop the ball. Or as Tony Blair once described it, \u2018take the Ming vase across the marble floor\u2019.\u201d He said the only moment when Johnson might have to emerge more comprehensively was if polling told him he was obviously losing ground to Hunt with Tory members \u2013 but that stage had not yet been reached. Johnson\u2019s supporters are defensive about his keeping away from scrutiny and insist 16 hustings across the country with members constitutes a huge amount of openness, as well as an ITV head-to-head debate scheduled for next week. Eddie Hughes, a Conservative MP supporting Johnson for the leadership, said it was \u201ctoo early for people to judge his level of engagement\u201d, and it was clear that he would do set-piece interviews and debates as the contest went on. But Hunt\u2019s team have sensed weakness in this area, branding his opponent a \u201ccoward\u201d over Johnson\u2019s newfound camera-shyness. Their strategy is the exact opposite: trying to gain maximum exposure for their candidate in the hope that Conservative members will get the jitters about Johnson and see their man as a safer, more sensible alternative. Steve Brine, a Conservative MP and one of Hunt\u2019s campaign organisers, said it benefited the foreign secretary to debate alongside Johnson as much as possible. \u201cThe first hustings event on the weekend was an eye-opener for many but I don\u2019t think it was for many MPs,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was Boris Johnson doing what he does, although even I was surprised he asked the interviewer how long was left.

News that the process was being started came before what had been intended to be a significant shadow cabinet meeting, but which senior Labour sources now say is unlikely to shift the party\u2019s policy any closer to a full-throated remain stance. In parliament on Monday, Corbyn made clear that Labour would try to force the next prime minister to put their Brexit plans \u201cback to the people\u201d. In response to a statement from Theresa May about last week\u2019s European council meeting,he asked the prime minister: \u201cIn her view, what would be worse: crashing out with no deal in October, or putting this issue back to the people for a final say?\u201cWhoever the next prime minister is, they will barely hold the support of this house, so they certainly have no mandate to force a disastrous hard-right Brexit on this country.

Several shadow cabinet members emerged from last week\u2019s meeting with the clear impression that a decision would be made about Labour\u2019s Brexit stance on Tuesday, after Corbyn had consulted trades union general secretaries. Corbyn\u2019s deputy, Tom Watson, said: \u201cWe had a long discussion last week and we all decided we were going to take a decision at the shadow cabinet.

Tensions at the top of the party exploded into the open after Labour\u2019s disastrous showing in last month\u2019s European elections, with Watson and the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, pushing openly for a shift in the party\u2019s stance.

In <a href=\"https://www.snp.org/nicola-sturgeons-speech-at-the-law-society-of-scotland/\">a speech to mark the 20th anniversary of devolution,</a> she ridiculed the traditional English claim that first-past-the-post delivers strong and stable government. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Perhaps most importantly of all, the Scottish parliament was always envisaged as a place where parties would have to seek compromise and consensus. The use of proportional representation in elections is the key reason for that. </p> <p>By contrast, the first past the post system used at Westminster is clearly unsuited to an age of multi-party politics. And the claim that used to be made for it was that it delivered strong and stable government. Nobody looking to Westminster at present would make that case.</p> <p>The emphasis on consensus at Holyrood is even reflected in the design of the parliament. MSPs sit in a horseshoe. At Westminster, MPs face each other- in a chamber designed to keep them two swords\u2019 lengths apart. </p> <p>I don\u2019t want to idealise the Scottish parliament too much. Anybody who watches first minister\u2019s questions will know that consensus has limits. </p> <p>Parties at Holyrood seek political advantage and argue strongly against each other \u2013 of course we do. But we also get a lot done. And we consistently work together. All of the legislative successes I\u2019ve mentioned had the support of more than one party. Several were passed unanimously. </p> <p>And it\u2019s hard not to look at Westminster \u2013 and particularly the deadlock that exists over Brexit \u2013 without thinking that these cultural differences have real consequences. The UK government\u2019s consistent inability to reach out to parties other than the DUP has been striking. And that\u2019s maybe partly because confrontation \u2013 not compromise \u2013 is inherent in the UK parliament\u2019s design, traditions and working methods. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b481b496a51b2bb5cf2e9d6d09db6b4c55fa0869\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b481b496a51b2bb5cf2e9d6d09db6b4c55fa0869/289_17_2090_1254/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sturgeon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Sturgeon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-24T16:52:33.416Z\">at 5.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d10f8af8f080e828514e9e6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-24T16:37:14.297Z\">5.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hunt would be better than Johnson at dealing with 3am emergency call, says Lidington</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of Hillary Clinton\u2019s most striking adverts in the 2008 US presidential election campaign asked voters who they would want answering the phone at 3am in the White House in a crisis. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">David Lidington,</strong> Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, who is now backing Jeremy Hunt, has been asking the same question. Speaking to reporters in Edinburgh, where he has been attending a Law Society of Scotland, he said the key issue for Tories in choosing a new leader should be who would be best best for security.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When I\u2019ve tried to weigh up in my mind the criteria. It seems to me first is which man is going to be better to shoulder the security responsibilities that come with the job of prime minister.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lidington said prime ministers had to consider how to respond to terror attacks and hostage situations. He went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister will have to take those decisions often under severe time pressure and almost inevitably on the basis of intelligence evidence that is by it\u2019s very nature going to be incomplete.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked who would deal best with these situations, Lidington said he would choose Hunt. Then, asked if he was saying Johnson did not have the temperament to be PM, Lidington replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am not implying anything \u2026 I am saying very clearly from having worked with both of them in cabinet \u2026 In my judgement Jeremy is the one who is best equipped to deal with the 3am call.</p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ_z9Tpdl9A\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aZ_z9Tpdl9A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Hillary Clinton 3am ad.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Lidington also criticised Johnson for avoiding the media.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it\u2019s wrong and it\u2019s also unwise for him to duck out of interviews and debates. </p> <p>We\u2019re choosing not just a party leader, we\u2019re choosing a prime minister, so I think the country is entitled to know what both the candidates for that office would have as their priorities and how they would go about discharging those responsibilities.

The police did attend the flat, and left after being satisfied that all was well. <strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg</strong>, the Tory Brexiter, was typical of the those criticising the neighbours when he said this morning that they were \u201cCorbynista curtain-twitchers\u201d. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/24/tory-leadership-latest-boris-johnson-jeremy-hunt-calls-boris-johnson-a-coward-for-dodging-tv-debates-and-interviews-live-news?page=with:block-5d1094d08f082364d7cf0070#block-5d1094d08f082364d7cf0070\">10.35am.)</a></p> <p>Speaking in the Commons on a point of order, the Labour MP <strong>Jess Phillips</strong>, who ran refuges for the Women\u2019s Aid Federation before entering parliament, said she was \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d this weekend to hear MPs suggesting that incidents like this were just private family matters. She went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m certain that in almost any circumstance people in this house don\u2019t believe that that is the case. However, I guess they had their priorities elsewhere when they went out to say it.

The request to the EU would have to come from the PM. A responsible PM might make such a request in the event of a pending general election, to keep options for whoever won, but if Boris Johnson were in this position in September, he would probably argue that he was elected party leader and prime minister on a mandate to deliver Brexit by 31 October come what may.</p> <p>I\u2019m afraid the monarch has not had the power to sack the prime minister, and appoint another one, for at least a century, and probably longer.

As a concession to the Treasury and the business department, which wanted a more open regime, it was agreed that this threshold would be subject to consultation.</p> <p><strong>Sajid Javid,</strong> the home secretary, has now published<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/home-secretary-asks-independent-migration-experts-to-advise-on-future-salary-thresholds\"> details of that consultation </a>\u2013 and his announcement strongly applies that the salary thresholds in the white paper are going to be abandoned. He is also floating the idea of having different salary thresholds for different areas of the country. This is from the Home Office news release.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The home secretary Sajid Javid has today asked the migration advisory committee to review and advise on salary thresholds for the future immigration system, which will start to take effect from 2021.</p> <p>The migration advisory committee previously recommended that we should retain the existing minimum salary thresholds in the future immigration system, which includes paying experienced workers at least \u00a330,000, and new entrants (including recent graduates) at least \u00a320,800.</p> <p>The home secretary has asked the migration advisory committee to consider how future salary thresholds should be calculated, the levels of salary thresholds, whether there is a case for regional salary thresholds for different parts of the UK, and whether there should be exceptions to salary thresholds, for example because they\u2019ve newly started the occupation or because they work in an occupation in shortage. </p> </blockquote> <p>A final decision would be taken by the next Tory MP (assuming the Conservatives stay in power). But Javid will be making this announcement knowing that both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are much more relaxed about immigration than May. </p> <p>Variable salary thresholds for different parts of the UK would be a policy with particular significance for Scotland, which is much more dependent on immigration than other parts of the UK. The SNP-led Scottish government has for years been saying it should have control over immigration policy in Scotland. At an event last week<strong> Nicola Sturgeon,</strong> Scotland\u2019s first minister, said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/18/tory-leadership-bbc-debate-boris-johnson-voting-results-gets-fresh-boost-as-leadsom-gives-her-support-live-news?page=with:block-5d092fc68f08374cc5790a9c#block-5d092fc68f08374cc5790a9c\">getting more power over immigration would be her top demand in terms of extending devolution</a>.

We have already heard the Tory MPs Dominic Grieve and Ken Clarke say they would vote against a Conservative government in a no-confidence debate to stop no deal, and MPs like Philip Hammond and Rory Stewart have hinted they might do the same. In an interview for the BBC, <strong>Tobias Ellwood</strong>, a defence minister, has said that in total about a dozen Tories would be willing to back a no-confidence motion in these circumstances. The government currently has a working majority, with the DUP, of around four, and so 12 Tories could easily bring down the new PM. Asked about Tory MPs supporting the \u201cnuclear option\u201d, denying the government Commons support to prevent no-deal, Ellwood said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe that absolutely is the case. </p> <p>I think a dozen or so members of parliament would be on our side, would be voting against supporting a no-deal and that would include ministers as well as backbenchers.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong>, Johnson\u2019s rival for the Conservative leadership, has been citing this as one reason why a Johnson administration could quickly collapse. Hunt has been doing a round of interviews this morning and he told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Johnson] is going to come to power on a very fragile coalition of people like Matt Hancock who wants no deal taken off the table, and Mark Francois who wants no deal.</p> <p>Sometimes in politics you can fudge and get away with it but in the case of Brexit you are going to have to make decisions immediately, and that very fragile coalition will collapse immediately when you have to make those decisions. </p> <p>If that happens we won\u2019t have another leadership contest, we will have Jeremy Corbyn in No 10 and there won\u2019t be any Brexit at all.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hunt also argued that this was why Johnson needed to stop dodging media scrutiny and agree to more TV debates, like the one planned by Sky tomorrow night (which Johnson is boycotting). <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-is-a-coward-says-jeremy-hunt-wdt7v6qpm\">In an article in the Times (paywall)</a> this morning Hunt said Johnson was being a coward. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Boris has done just one interview on Today in the past year. I have done 16. He has not appeared on The Andrew Marr Show this year and his one broadcast interview of this campaign, with World at One, was arranged with just 10 minutes\u2019 notice so Mark Mardell had no time to prepare questions. And now he is refusing point blank to do TV debates. Pathetically, within hours of getting through to the final two he \u201cchallenged\u201d me to the ITV debate.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has used a statement to the Commons to restate his call for any Brexit deal agreed by parliament to be put to the public in a second referendum. (See 4.07pm.) David Lidington, the de facto deputy prime minister, has said he would trust Jeremy Hunt more than Boris Johnson to deal with a 3am emergency facing No 10. (See 5.37am.) Full police support would be needed for officials if they tried to go into nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to do Brexit checks, one of the authors of a report on alternative arrangements to the Irish border backstop has been told. Migrants coming to the UK could face varying minimum salary thresholds depending on where they live under proposals put out for review by the home secretary, Sajid Javid. Conservatives have stepped up warnings that a Boris Johnson premiership could lead to the collapse of the government if the leadership frontrunner attempts to pursue no deal. Boris Johnson does speak to Steve Bannon, Nigel Farage has said, increasing the pressure on the Conservative leadership frontrunner to explain his links to Donald Trump\u2019s controversial former campaign manager. Labour plans to give the Bank of England powers to help check the readiness of City firms to cut carbon emissions and invest responsibly to tackle the climate emergency, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has said. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, also spoke at the Law Society of Scotland conference. In a speech to mark the 20th anniversary of devolution, she ridiculed the traditional English claim that first-past-the-post delivers strong and stable government. She said: Perhaps most importantly of all, the Scottish parliament was always envisaged as a place where parties would have to seek compromise and consensus. The use of proportional representation in elections is the key reason for that. By contrast, the first past the post system used at Westminster is clearly unsuited to an age of multi-party politics. And the claim that used to be made for it was that it delivered strong and stable government. Nobody looking to Westminster at present would make that case. The emphasis on consensus at Holyrood is even reflected in the design of the parliament. MSPs sit in a horseshoe. At Westminster, MPs face each other- in a chamber designed to keep them two swords\u2019 lengths apart. I don\u2019t want to idealise the Scottish parliament too much. Anybody who watches first minister\u2019s questions will know that consensus has limits. Parties at Holyrood seek political advantage and argue strongly against each other \u2013 of course we do. But we also get a lot done. And we consistently work together. All of the legislative successes I\u2019ve mentioned had the support of more than one party. Several were passed unanimously. And it\u2019s hard not to look at Westminster \u2013 and particularly the deadlock that exists over Brexit \u2013 without thinking that these cultural differences have real consequences. The UK government\u2019s consistent inability to reach out to parties other than the DUP has been striking. And that\u2019s maybe partly because confrontation \u2013 not compromise \u2013 is inherent in the UK parliament\u2019s design, traditions and working methods. One of Hillary Clinton\u2019s most striking adverts in the 2008 US presidential election campaign asked voters who they would want answering the phone at 3am in the White House in a crisis. David Lidington, Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, who is now backing Jeremy Hunt, has been asking the same question. Speaking to reporters in Edinburgh, where he has been attending a Law Society of Scotland, he said the key issue for Tories in choosing a new leader should be who would be best best for security. When I\u2019ve tried to weigh up in my mind the criteria. It seems to me first is which man is going to be better to shoulder the security responsibilities that come with the job of prime minister. Lidington said prime ministers had to consider how to respond to terror attacks and hostage situations. He went on: The prime minister will have to take those decisions often under severe time pressure and almost inevitably on the basis of intelligence evidence that is by it\u2019s very nature going to be incomplete. Asked who would deal best with these situations, Lidington said he would choose Hunt. Then, asked if he was saying Johnson did not have the temperament to be PM, Lidington replied: I am not implying anything \u2026 I am saying very clearly from having worked with both of them in cabinet \u2026 In my judgement Jeremy is the one who is best equipped to deal with the 3am call. Lidington also criticised Johnson for avoiding the media. I think it\u2019s wrong and it\u2019s also unwise for him to duck out of interviews and debates. We\u2019re choosing not just a party leader, we\u2019re choosing a prime minister, so I think the country is entitled to know what both the candidates for that office would have as their priorities and how they would go about discharging those responsibilities. So I hope he thinks again and I hope he does agree to take part. Over the weekend a lot of Boris Johnson supporters have been criticising the couple who alerted first the police, and then the Guardian, after they heard Johnson having a furious row with his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, in her flat, involving loud screaming, shouting and banging. The police did attend the flat, and left after being satisfied that all was well. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, was typical of the those criticising the neighbours when he said this morning that they were \u201cCorbynista curtain-twitchers\u201d. (See 10.35am.) Speaking in the Commons on a point of order, the Labour MP Jess Phillips, who ran refuges for the Women\u2019s Aid Federation before entering parliament, said she was \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d this weekend to hear MPs suggesting that incidents like this were just private family matters. She went on: I\u2019m certain that in almost any circumstance people in this house don\u2019t believe that that is the case. However, I guess they had their priorities elsewhere when they went out to say it. What that has led to is that all the women\u2019s charities in this country have today had to issue a statement to assert that of course people should call the police, of course people should gather evidence where they can, and of course people should try and intervene. Because the message that came from this house ... was people should not try to help. Please, Mr Speaker, will you assert that domestic abuse is never just a domestic, it is never a personal family matter. Today\u2019s Evening Standard editorial claims that Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, has told Theresa May that she should only advise the Queen to appoint Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt as her successor if she is confident that they can command a majority in the Commons. Earlier this month Downing Street gave a briefing implying that May could delay her resignation if she thought that a successor like Johnson would not command the confidence of the Commons. Subsequently Number 10 said that the prime minister\u2019s spokesman\u2019s comments had been misunderstood, and that May would definitely be going as soon as the new Tory leader was elected. But what if it were to look as though a new leader like Johnson would lose an immediate confidence vote? Unfortunately the cabinet manual, which is the nearest thing the UK has to a constitutional rulebook, does not explain what should happen in a scenario exactly like this. But, as a recent report (pdf) from the public administration and constitutional affairs points out, the manual does imply that, if a PM loses a confidence vote, he or she is \u201cunder a duty not to resign unless and until it is clear another person commands the confidence of the house\u201d. In the Commons Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, asked May if she agreed that the new prime minister should come to the Commons before the summer recess to explain his Brexit plan, and to show that he had the confidence of the house. But May said this would be a matter for the next PM. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant asks if the new prime minister will address the Commons about Brexit within a week of taking office. It would be a disgrace if he waited until September, he says. May says this is not a matter for her. May suggests new prime minister may not face questions from MPs until September. Under a draft timetable for the announcement of the Tory leadership election winner, May\u2019s final PMQs and the start of recess, the new prime minister would take office the night before recess, meaning he probably would not face MPs for the first time until September. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Wesminster, also invited Theresa May to criticise Boris Johnson for suggesting that the UK would be able to negotiate changes to the backstop during the transition period. May did not really respond to this point when Jeremy Corbyn raised it, but she did second time round. Responding to Blackford, she said David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, refuted this claim in a tweet at the weekend. This is what Jeremy Corbyn said in his response to Theresa May about no deal: The two Tory leadership candidates are still saying that if they can\u2019t renegotiate the backstop \u2013 which the EU leaders said was not possible last week \u2013 then they would pursue a no-deal exit. Will the prime minister tell us, whether she believes no deal should be on the table as a viable option? And, in her view, what would be worse: crashing out with no deal in October, or putting this issue back to the people for a final say? And this is what Corbyn said Boris Johnson, and about a second referendum: Neither of the Tory leadership candidates have a credible plan. One even claims we can crash out on WTO terms and still trade without tariffs ... The former foreign secretary also told us that under his no-deal plan he could, and I quote, \u2018solve the problem of free movement of goods in the context of the free trade agreement \u2026 that we\u2019ll negotiate in the implementation period\u2019. Mr Speaker, can the prime minister confirm that if there is no deal there will not be an implementation period? It is deeply worrying that those who seek to lead this country have no grip on reality. The prime minister said the council reiterated its wish to avoid a \u2018disorderly Brexit\u2019. I\u2019m not sure they will have been reassured by the statements of her potential successors. Labour put forward a plan that could bring this country back together, but the prime minister refused to compromise. Whoever the next prime minister is, they will barely hold the support of this House, so they certainly have no mandate to force a disastrous hard-right Brexit on this country. And I make it clear that Labour will work across the House to block no deal. But whatever Brexit plan the new Tory leader comes up with, after three long years of failure, they should have the confidence to go back to the people on a deal agreed by parliament. May is responding to Corbyn. She says he asked about Brexit and the Tory leadership election, which were subjects that did not come up at the EU summit. But she says no deal is \u201cthe default option\u201d. She says she wanted to leave the EU on 29 March. If Labour had voted for it, \u201cwe would already be out.\u201d She says she had voted for a deal three times, while Corbyn had voted against the deal, increasing the chance of no deal. She says the Tories are not divorced from reality; the person most divorced from reality is Corbyn himself, who wants to follow the Venezuelan economic model, she claims. Corbyn asks May if she agrees with Boris Johnson that it would be possible to negotiate a solution to the backstop during the transition. He says Labour will work with other MPs to block no deal. And he ends by saying the government should let the public decide on Brexit. Whatever Brexit plan the new Tory leader comes up with, after three long years of failure they should have the confidence to go back to the people on a deal agreed by parliament. Turning to Brexit, Corbyn says there have been three wasted years since the vote to leave the EU. And we will soon be on our third prime minister, he says. He says Theresa May wasted time appealing to the wilder extremes in her party, instead of reaching out across the Commons. Does she accept it was a mistake to legitimise the idea of no deal? Does May believe no deal should be on the table as a viable option? What would be worse? Crashing out in October? Or putting it back to the people for a final say? Corbyn implies a second referendum would be preferable to a no-deal Brexit. He asks May to confirm the UK would not be ready to crash out in October. Back in the Commons, Jeremy Corbyn is responding to Theresa May. He starts by saying it is 10 years since John Bercow became Speaker. \u201cCongratulations on the first 10 years,\u201d he says. He also sends his best wishes to John Prescott. And then he turns to Iran. Last week the world was only minutes away from a US-Iran war, he says. He says the Iran nuclear deal should be defended. Turning back to migration for a moment, Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury who currently seems to be spending much of her time acting as Boris Johnson\u2019s chief media spokesperson, has warmly welcomed Sajid Javid\u2019s decision to review income thresholds for immigrants after Brexit. Theresa May starts by wishing John Prescott a full recovery. She says the EU summit focused on climate change, disinformation, the EU\u2019s external relations, and what the EU calls its \u201ctop jobs\u201d. She says she was there because the UK has agreed to continue contributing fully to EU discussions while it remains a member. Theresa May is about to make a Commons statement on last week\u2019s EU summit. She may get quite a lot of questions about Brexit but, unless she decides to comment on the Brexit plans being floated by her two potential successors (which seems unlikely), it is hard to see what she might say that will qualify as news. Here are two questions from below the line on a topic that is the subject of much chatter at Westminster at the moment \u2013 how the timing of a no-confidence vote might interact with the article 50 process. It is not easy to answer these questions, because the article 50 process is unprecedented \u2013 no other country has every used article 50 to leave the EU \u2013 and the UK has never seen a no-confidence vote lead to a general election under the procedure set out in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. But it is possible that a no-confidence vote in September, followed by a 14-day wait to see if a new government could win a vote of confidence, followed by the calling of an election, which would have to take place 25 working days after the dissolution of parliament, would leave little or no time for the UK to request an article 50 extension before the 31 October deadline. There is no provision for parliament to request an article 50 extension. The request to the EU would have to come from the PM. A responsible PM might make such a request in the event of a pending general election, to keep options for whoever won, but if Boris Johnson were in this position in September, he would probably argue that he was elected party leader and prime minister on a mandate to deliver Brexit by 31 October come what may. I\u2019m afraid the monarch has not had the power to sack the prime minister, and appoint another one, for at least a century, and probably longer. And she does not have the power to request an article 50 extension, even if she wanted one. Labour is to examine the readiness of City firms to cut carbon emissions and invest responsibly to tackle the climate emergency, the shadow chancellor John McDonnell said this morning. As my colleague Philip Inman reports, a review into City practices and how investments can be directed to promote technologies that cut carbon emissions will report by October as part of the party\u2019s support for policies tied to the green industrial revolution. Speaking to City executives in central London, McDonnell said he also wanted the Bank of England to help monitor the City\u2019s progress towards lower carbon emissions. This new responsibility would be on top of Labour\u2019s plan to make the central bank also adopt policies that will boost the productivity of British firms. Theresa May still has a month left to serve as prime minister, but already her policy agenda is being shredded. A relative hardliner in Tory terms on immigration, she pushed hard for a high salary threshold for skilled workers coming to the UK after Brexit and, when the government\u2019s white paper on immigration was published in December, it proposed a rule saying migrants would have to be earning \u00a330,000 a year to qualify as a skilled worker for a five-year visa. As a concession to the Treasury and the business department, which wanted a more open regime, it was agreed that this threshold would be subject to consultation. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, has now published details of that consultation \u2013 and his announcement strongly applies that the salary thresholds in the white paper are going to be abandoned. He is also floating the idea of having different salary thresholds for different areas of the country. This is from the Home Office news release. The home secretary Sajid Javid has today asked the migration advisory committee to review and advise on salary thresholds for the future immigration system, which will start to take effect from 2021. The migration advisory committee previously recommended that we should retain the existing minimum salary thresholds in the future immigration system, which includes paying experienced workers at least \u00a330,000, and new entrants (including recent graduates) at least \u00a320,800. The home secretary has asked the migration advisory committee to consider how future salary thresholds should be calculated, the levels of salary thresholds, whether there is a case for regional salary thresholds for different parts of the UK, and whether there should be exceptions to salary thresholds, for example because they\u2019ve newly started the occupation or because they work in an occupation in shortage. A final decision would be taken by the next Tory MP (assuming the Conservatives stay in power). But Javid will be making this announcement knowing that both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are much more relaxed about immigration than May. Variable salary thresholds for different parts of the UK would be a policy with particular significance for Scotland, which is much more dependent on immigration than other parts of the UK. The SNP-led Scottish government has for years been saying it should have control over immigration policy in Scotland. At an event last week Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said that getting more power over immigration would be her top demand in terms of extending devolution. She also revealed that, at the recent D-day commemoration event, Johnson was joking with her about what might be needed to \u201cbuy you guys off\u201d (ie to quash the demand for independence). Jeremy Hunt has stepped up his criticism of Boris Johnson for avoiding media scrutiny in the Tory leadership campaign, calling it \u201cdisrespectful\u201d, as another minister said Johnson could be brought down by his own MPs if he pushed for a no-deal Brexit. Boris Johnson\u2019s refusal to face public scrutiny as he runs for the Conservative party leadership has prompted Sky News to cancel a televised debate this week. John Griffin, one of the Conservative party\u2019s most generous donors, has joined a growing chorus of demands for Boris Johnson to explain why police were called to his home after an altercation with his partner. The People\u2019s Vote campaign has criticised plans published by the Alternative Arrangements Commission for an alternative to the backstop as unworkable. In a statement responding to the report (see 12.27pm) issued by People\u2019s Vote, the Labour MP Owen Smith said: The idea of trying to replace the Northern Ireland backstop with so-called \u2018alternative arrangements\u2019 has already been tested to destruction. There is no political will to do so from either Ireland, the rest of the EU or most importantly the people of Northern Ireland, particularly those living on or near the border. This new report does nothing to address that crucial underlying point. Talk of vague \u2018technological solutions\u2019, special economic zones or checks away from the border still fail to meet the basic test for a durable solution to this intractable problem. It needs to have the consent of both the people of Northern Ireland and of the Republic of Ireland \u2013 those who it will affect the most. And it\u2019s clear it doesn\u2019t have that consent on either side of the border. The Alternative Arrangements Commission is nothing more or less than a desperate attempt to make a square peg fit into a round hole in order to try and hold the warring factions of the Conservative party together. The future of Northern Ireland is too important to be treated like this. The only way to a deliver a lasting and stable solution to this problem is to give the public the final say. The Brexit party is to launch a formal legal challenge against the result of this month\u2019s Peterborough byelection, where it was narrowly beaten by Labour, claiming that allegations of corruption connected to postal votes need to be investigated. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has put forward the prospect of a coalition with the Conservative party to ensure the UK leaves the EU without a deal, and offered Johnson his support following his row with his partner. Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s head of communications, has dismissed allegations that misuse of the social network influenced the EU referendum result. The former deputy prime minister John Prescott has been admitted to hospital after having a stroke, prompting messages of support from current and former Labour leaders. This is from Jeremy Corbyn. Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, has reaffirmed his willingness to vote against the government in a no-confidence debate to stop a no-deal Brexit. Asked about this possible scenario on The World at One, he said: It depends on the circumstances at the time and what whoever is prime minister is putting forward as the policy he is going to pursue. But I am not going to vote in favour of a government that says it is going to pursue policies which are totally incompatible with everything the Conservative party has stood for under all those prime ministers for the decades that I have been in parliament. Here is a source from the Jeremy Hunt camp responding to the news that Sky has cancelled the leaders\u2019 debate planned for tomorrow because Boris Johnson has refused to attend. (See 11.07am.) The source said: Bottler Boris and his complacent campaign have shown they can\u2019t trust their candidate to turn up and perform. David Henig, the former civil servant who now heads the UK Trade Policy Project, has written a Twitter thread with a good commentary on the Alternative Arrangements Commission conference. (See 12.27pm and 12.35pm.) It starts here. Today\u2019s Evening Standard, which is backing Boris Johnson for the Conservative party leadership, is splashing on a story based on a picture apparently showing Johnson making up with his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds. My colleague Owen Jones thinks that, in the light of the way the Johnsonites have been complaining about \u201cCorbynista curtain-twitchers\u201d and the like (see 10.35am), this is an example of hypocrisy. These are from my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll, who has been attending the Alternative Arrangements Commission conference this morning. Shanker Singham is a member of the commission, and a pro-Brexit trade expert. As my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports, the Alternative Arrangements Commission, which was set up to look at ways of managing the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit to avoid the need for the backstop (which would effectively keep the UK in the customs union), has published an interim report today. There is a 35-page summary here (pdf), and the full 203-page interim report is here (pdf). On the Today programme this morning Greg Hands, the former international trade minister and one of the co-chairs of the commission, said the ideas in the report were a viable alternative to the backstop. He said he thought it would be possible to negotiate this with the EU before 31 October, although he said it would take up to two to three years to introduce these alternative arrangements. He went on: We think it is possible to have this. We will be publishing next month an alternative arrangements protocol that could be inserted either into the withdrawal agreement or into any new form of Brexit that might be negotiated by the next UK prime minister. Hands accepted that, for traders in Ireland, his plans would not amount to \u201cno change\u201d from the status quo. But the proposals would avoid a hard border, he said. The Brexit party is to launch a formal legal challenge against the result of this month\u2019s Peterborough byelection, where it was narrowly beaten by Labour, alleging that allegations of corruption connected to postal votes need to be investigated. Nigel Farage, the party leader, insisted the challenge was about more than the loss to Labour by 683 votes, saying the wider use of postal votes was open to abuse and needed to be investigated. Speaking at a press conference in London, he said: I know people will say, \u2018Oh, but it\u2019s sour grapes.\u2019 It isn\u2019t. Actually, as far as I\u2019m concerned, this is about a lot more than Peterborough. It is about a system that is wide open to corruption, to intimidation, to bribery, to abuse on a whole number of levels. I have mentioned this a number of times in the past. The party plans to issue a petition under the 1983 Representation of the People Act, which allows election results to be challenged retrospectively for reasons including errors or corruption connected to the polling. Such challenges are rare, with the last successful one coming in 2010, when the Labour minister Phil Woolas was ejected from his Oldham East and Saddleworth constituency after a specially convened election court upheld a complaint that Woolas had knowingly lied about his Lib Dem opponent. One of the Conservative party\u2019s most generous donors has joined a growing chorus of demands for Boris Johnson to explain why police were called to his home after an altercation with his partner. As my colleague Rajeev Syal reports, John Griffin, the taxi tycoon who has given \u00a34m to the Tories over the last six years, has expressed concerns about the morality of the favourite to become prime minister and called on him to explain the circumstances of a furious row with his partner, Carrie Symonds. Boris Johnson has not generally been giving interviews since the Tory leadership contest formally started two weeks ago but a large number of his supporters have been touring the broadcast studios speaking on his behalf, with varying degrees of effectiveness. One has been the Tory Brexiter Marcus Fysh. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire show, Fysh said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d for Jeremy Hunt to call Johnson a coward for avoiding TV debates. (See 9.18am.) Fysh said: [Johnson] is certainly not a coward, as was said by his opponent today in a very negative way. That\u2019s a ridiculous assertion to make. In the interview, which was broadcast before Sky News announced it intended to cancel tomorrow\u2019s debate (see 11.07am), Fysh also said \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d when asked if he thought Johnson should take part in the event. But he said he did not think Johnson needed to attend because he would be taking part in hustings \u201cpretty much every day\u201d for the next month. John Prescott, who was deputy prime minister for 10 years during Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government, is recovering from a stroke, his family have said in a statement. Jeremy Corbyn was due to be meeting union leaders this morning, ahead of a shadow cabinet meeting tomorrow where Labour will decide whether to firm up its support for a second referendum and remain. Corbyn has already said that the party would put any Brexit deal to a second referendum, but he has not committed Labour to backing remain, or committed the party to making remain a general election pledge. Ahead of today\u2019s meeting, the People\u2019s Vote campaign has released a poll from YouGov of almost 2,000 trade unionists showing that, by a wide margin, they want a second referendum and want Labour to campaign for remain. Here are some of the findings. The polls show that rank-and-file trade union members: Support staying in the EU by a margin of 71 to 29% if there is a new referendum. Back having a people\u2019s vote by 64 to 33%. Support for such a final say referendum rises to 78% with just 17% opposed among trade unionists who voted Labour in the last general election. Want Labour to campaign for the UK to stay in the EU by a three-to-one margin of 60 to 21% \u2013 rising to 74 to 10% among the party\u2019s 2017 voters. Commenting on the results, the Labour MP Jo Stevens, secretary of the trade union group of Labour MPs and a People\u2019s Vote supporter, said: Labour\u2019s official position is still too far behind that of our party members and voters, not to mention grassroots trade unionists who are the bedrock of our movement. When Jeremy Corbyn meets with trade union general secretaries, I hope he hears the strong message from working people, trade union members up and down the country, that we want a people\u2019s vote just like his constituents do in Islington \u2013 because now, more than ever, we need those voices to be heard. I\u2019m back in the office. And good news \u2013 the Palace of Westminster is not burning down. The fire alarm was a test. Earlier I said that Sky News was planning a TV debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt tomorrow, but that Johnson was refusing to take part. (See 9.18am.) But Sky News has now said it will cancel tomorrow\u2019s event if Johnson refuses to participate and will challenge him instead to attend a debate a week today. In his LBC phone-in this morning, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, strongly criticised the neighbours who recorded Boris Johnson and his girlfriend Carrie Symonds having a furious row in her flat and who contacted the police because of their concerns, before alerting the Guardian. Rees-Mogg dismissed them as \u201cCorbynista curtain-twitchers\u201d. Asked about the incident, he said: I think it\u2019s absolutely dreadful. I think the idea that snooping neighbours are recording what is going on for political advantage and then Class War protesters are coming to politicians\u2019 front doors \u2013 which happened to me as well \u2013 is not a good place for politics to be. I think politicians should feel safe and unmolested in their homes. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an unreasonable thing to ask for ... And snoopers are always unattractive. Corbynista curtain-twitchers are not attractive. (I\u2019ve got to leave the office for a while because the fire alarm is going off, in what seems to be a regular Monday morning test. Hopefully I\u2019ll be back in about 20 minutes.) Sir Nicholas Soames, the Conservative former minister, has been tweeting critically about Boris Johnson this morning. But Nadine Dorries, a strong Johnson supporter, has been tweeting a message of support. Here is an extract from Boris Johnson\u2019s Telegraph column today (paywall) where he reasserts his determination to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October. He says: We are just over four months away from the date on which, by law, we must leave the EU; and this time we are not going to bottle it. We are not going to fail. This time we are not going to shrink in fear from the exit, as we have on the last two occasions. We are going to show all the mettle, the creativity and the energy of this amazing nation. We are going to focus all our efforts on honouring that single great promise \u2013 and we are going to come out of the EU on October 31. Presumably this is not one of those Johnson columns that the Telegraph would describe as \u201cclearly comically polemical\u201d and something that \u201ccould not be reasonably read as a serious, empirical, in-depth analysis of hard factual matters\u201d, which was the Telegraph response to the Independent Press Standards Organisation when a reader complained about Johnson making a false claim about Brexit public opinion in one of his columns earlier this year. In his regular Daily Telegraph column this morning Boris Johnson, the favourite in the Tory leadership contest, reaffirms his commitment (seen as wobby by some) to deliver Brexit by 31 October in all circumstances. He declares four times that the UK will leave the EU by that date. But this morning we\u2019ve heard fresh evidence as to why Johnson could find delivering a no-deal Brexit by 31 October impossible. We have already heard the Tory MPs Dominic Grieve and Ken Clarke say they would vote against a Conservative government in a no-confidence debate to stop no deal, and MPs like Philip Hammond and Rory Stewart have hinted they might do the same. In an interview for the BBC, Tobias Ellwood, a defence minister, has said that in total about a dozen Tories would be willing to back a no-confidence motion in these circumstances. The government currently has a working majority, with the DUP, of around four, and so 12 Tories could easily bring down the new PM. Asked about Tory MPs supporting the \u201cnuclear option\u201d, denying the government Commons support to prevent no-deal, Ellwood said: I believe that absolutely is the case. I think a dozen or so members of parliament would be on our side, would be voting against supporting a no-deal and that would include ministers as well as backbenchers. Jeremy Hunt, Johnson\u2019s rival for the Conservative leadership, has been citing this as one reason why a Johnson administration could quickly collapse. Hunt has been doing a round of interviews this morning and he told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: [Johnson] is going to come to power on a very fragile coalition of people like Matt Hancock who wants no deal taken off the table, and Mark Francois who wants no deal. Sometimes in politics you can fudge and get away with it but in the case of Brexit you are going to have to make decisions immediately, and that very fragile coalition will collapse immediately when you have to make those decisions. If that happens we won\u2019t have another leadership contest, we will have Jeremy Corbyn in No 10 and there won\u2019t be any Brexit at all. Hunt also argued that this was why Johnson needed to stop dodging media scrutiny and agree to more TV debates, like the one planned by Sky tomorrow night (which Johnson is boycotting). In an article in the Times (paywall) this morning Hunt said Johnson was being a coward. He said: Boris has done just one interview on Today in the past year. I have done 16. He has not appeared on The Andrew Marr Show this year and his one broadcast interview of this campaign, with World at One, was arranged with just 10 minutes\u2019 notice so Mark Mardell had no time to prepare questions. And now he is refusing point blank to do TV debates. Pathetically, within hours of getting through to the final two he \u201cchallenged\u201d me to the ITV debate. I willingly accepted even though it was scheduled for three weeks later, after most members have received their postal votes and after many of them will have voted ... The first debate that Boris has been invited to will be on Sky News tomorrow evening. I\u2019ll be there. So don\u2019t be a coward Boris, man up and show the nation you can cope with the intense scrutiny the most difficult job in the country will involve. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter and chair of the European Research Group, holds an LBC phone-in. 9.35am: Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, speaks at a conference where an interim report from the Alternative Arrangements Commission, which is looking at alternatives to the backstop, is being published. 10.30am: Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, holds a press conference on postal votes. 11am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech on the economy and Labour\u2019s plans for sustainable investment. 11.20am: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, gives a speech to the Law Society of Edinburgh. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime, and another when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Within these areas there would be free movement of goods and people, meaning no checks.</p> \n<p>The report was welcomed by many critics of Brexit in Northern Ireland but was described as three years too late.</p> \n<p>Former Tory defence secretary Michael Fallon said the UK should have acted more responsibly at the start. \u201cWe should have made a much more generous offer to Ireland immediately after the referendum,\u201d because it was most impacted by the vote.</p> \n<p>Sources at the EU said that the AAC was not a government organisation and the backstop remained the only solution on the table.</p> \n<p>It added however it would stand by this agreement to work on alternative solutions, which meet the same objectives in the withdrawal agreement.</p> \n<p>Neil McDonnell, the chief executive of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprise Association (Isme), commended Singham for engaging on the detail but said the report would have been far better if it came in March or April 2016, before the EU referendum.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt would have shown voters this was not a binary decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThe beauty of this report is it shows the complete bedlam that will be caused by Brexit.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said the debate about alternative arrangements was like \u201can internal conversation among Brexiters\u201d, and many still did not understand the costs that Brexit checks would add for ordinary businesses, operating on margins sometimes of less than 1%.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to hear all this stuff is feasible in five years if we are all out of business by then,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>McDonnell told a special <a href=\"https://www.prosperity-uk.com/aaclondonagenda/\">conference</a> on the Irish border on Monday that 80% of Northern Ireland micro-businesses \u2013 those that employ fewer than 10 people \u2013 export only to the Republic of Ireland, and could be adversely affected by the cost of customs and other checks.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b146305d-32c1-4dc9-9f4d-b60ce025264f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal it would by default, become a \u201cthird country\u201d, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods. This has also been referred to by government ministers as an \"Australia-style deal\". Australia does not have a free trade agreement with the EU.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Sceptics in the audience also questioned the cost, the legality and the support the EU or Irish government would offer for alternative proposals.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are no solutions offered for VAT, state aid or providing market access.

      "bodyText": "Full police support would be needed for officials if they tried to go into nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to do Brexit checks, one of the authors of a report on alternative arrangements to the Irish border backstop has been told. Shanker Singham said he was given this advice by a community representative recently when in the Creggan estate in Derry, where the journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead in April. Singham is the chairman of the alternative arrangements commission (AAC) technical group, which published a 200-page report on Monday examining options for keeping the Irish border invisible after Brexit. The AAC has made eight recommendations for alternative arrangements, which it says could be ready within three years. If correct and accepted by the EU it would mean the backstop would not be needed after 2022. Singham said he was able to assure the Derry communities that one of the AAC\u2019s central proposals was to create special economic zones stretching to 30 miles (48km) either side of the border. Within these areas there would be free movement of goods and people, meaning no checks. The report was welcomed by many critics of Brexit in Northern Ireland but was described as three years too late. Former Tory defence secretary Michael Fallon said the UK should have acted more responsibly at the start. \u201cWe should have made a much more generous offer to Ireland immediately after the referendum,\u201d because it was most impacted by the vote. Sources at the EU said that the AAC was not a government organisation and the backstop remained the only solution on the table. It added however it would stand by this agreement to work on alternative solutions, which meet the same objectives in the withdrawal agreement. Neil McDonnell, the chief executive of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprise Association (Isme), commended Singham for engaging on the detail but said the report would have been far better if it came in March or April 2016, before the EU referendum. \u201cIt would have shown voters this was not a binary decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThe beauty of this report is it shows the complete bedlam that will be caused by Brexit.\u201d He said the debate about alternative arrangements was like \u201can internal conversation among Brexiters\u201d, and many still did not understand the costs that Brexit checks would add for ordinary businesses, operating on margins sometimes of less than 1%. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to hear all this stuff is feasible in five years if we are all out of business by then,\u201d he said. McDonnell told a special conference on the Irish border on Monday that 80% of Northern Ireland micro-businesses \u2013 those that employ fewer than 10 people \u2013 export only to the Republic of Ireland, and could be adversely affected by the cost of customs and other checks. Sceptics in the audience also questioned the cost, the legality and the support the EU or Irish government would offer for alternative proposals. \u201cThere are no solutions offered for VAT, state aid or providing market access. Why would the EU drop the backstop, which guarantees the things it wants to guarantee, and rely on this approach instead?\u201d said Stephen Kelly, the chief executive of Manufacturing Northern Ireland. \u201cWhy would border communities prefer this increased hive of enforcement, the greater intrusion of HMRC and others, when there could be none?\u201d Seamus Leheny, the Northern Ireland policy manager at the Freight Transport Association, said the proposals to create a common rulebook on food for the island of Ireland and Britain was \u201casking a lot of big asks from the Irish government\u201d as it would be asking Dublin to give up some EU membership benefits. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly creative but it has a lot of complex questions still to answer,\u201d he said. Singham said the AAC did not get engagement from the Irish government, which has said the backstop will remain on the table even if the UK crashes out of the EU as it is the only alternative to current arrangements that is acceptable. Singham said the AAC had spoken to 50 stakeholder groups in Northern Ireland since the end of April, along with 50 parliamentarians across the spectrum.",

By the morning of 24 June, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mwolferobinson/status/1141719981425659904\">11 others</a> scheduled to speak had also withdrawn (Lola Olufemi, Waithera Sebatindira, Malia Bouattia, Sahar Al-Faifi, Dilly Hussain, Hussein Kesvani, Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff, Paula Akpan, Lauren Booth and Madiha Raza). We did not do so because we oppose the festival itself. I have previously performed poetry there and believe the BLF has done invaluable work for the local community through years of grassroots engagement centred on BME people. However, I chose not to participate this year when I found out the festival was a beneficiary of a fund called <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-a-stronger-britain-together\">Building a Stronger Britain Together (BSBT)</a>. This fund comes from the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/counter-extremism-strategy\">Counter-Extremism Strategy</a> (CES) and it is this strategy, this fund, and this connection that I and others oppose.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bradford\u2019s predominantly Pakistani, Muslim population has long been looked at through a lens of criminality</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The government\u2019s website describes BSBT as \u201cfunding and support for groups involved in counter-extremism projects in their communities\u201d, and it was used <a href=\"https://www.bradfordlitfest.co.uk/statement-withdrawal-speakers-years-festival/\">to fund some of BLF\u2019s pre-festival programmes</a> engaging local Muslim women on their aspirations and literacy. While I am sure the programmes were beneficial to participants, it is highly problematic to suggest that the people the projects engage are at risk of becoming extremists due solely to their identity. It is rooted in the <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0306396812454984\">counter-radicalisation thesis</a> that suggests that since <em>any</em> Muslim could become violent, all Muslims require monitoring. It reduces Muslims to subjects requiring de-radicalisation.</p> <p>Bradford\u2019s predominantly Pakistani, Muslim population has long been looked at through a lens of criminality. Not only does BSBT look at the community through that same lens but it also entails a level of information collection, because it requires reporting on outcomes. There is no guarantee how that information is used or stored.</p> <p>BSBT requires recipients to show \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-a-stronger-britain-together\">demonstrable outcomes which provide a positive alternative to extremist voices</a>\u201d, thus framing the festival as less of a community-centred space of art and discussion and more as a deliberate, targeted strategy \u2013 one that insinuates that Muslim women\u2019s educational and literacy levels correlate to extremism. Counter-extremism works largely to hide the material conditions that disenfranchise people, which may lead them to express grievances violently \u2013 including austerity, poverty, structural racism, Islamophobia and more. A government could seek to change these rather than funnelling money into an apparatus that approaches Muslims as a suspect community living in a vacuum.</p> <p>This is particularly pernicious in the austerity context, where government has pulled money from arts and culture and cut local council budgets so that spaces such as libraries and community centres are on the decline. It means counter-extremism becomes one of very few pots of funding that groups such as BLF feel they can draw on to create those missing spaces. This makes organisations dependent on counter-extremism funding. We refuse to give credibility to the idea there is demand for such funds. Some have argued that we should express this opinion <em>at </em>the festival, but this counter-extremism strategy would only gain more credibility if it could be said dissenting voices were given space to speak under its banner. I refuse to normalise it as an acceptable way to work with marginalised Muslim communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/20/six-pull-out-bradford-literature-festival-counter-extremism-funding\">Six pull out of Bradford festival over counter-extremism funding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With others who have withdrawn, I want to expose the pernicious way counter-extremism works.

      "bodyText": "Suhaiymah Manzoor-Khan: I\u2019m boycotting the festival because of its counter-extremism funding Three days ago I shared a public statement explaining my withdrawal from the Bradford literature festival 2019. By the morning of 24 June, 11 others scheduled to speak had also withdrawn (Lola Olufemi, Waithera Sebatindira, Malia Bouattia, Sahar Al-Faifi, Dilly Hussain, Hussein Kesvani, Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff, Paula Akpan, Lauren Booth and Madiha Raza). We did not do so because we oppose the festival itself. I have previously performed poetry there and believe the BLF has done invaluable work for the local community through years of grassroots engagement centred on BME people. However, I chose not to participate this year when I found out the festival was a beneficiary of a fund called Building a Stronger Britain Together (BSBT). This fund comes from the government\u2019s Counter-Extremism Strategy (CES) and it is this strategy, this fund, and this connection that I and others oppose. The government\u2019s website describes BSBT as \u201cfunding and support for groups involved in counter-extremism projects in their communities\u201d, and it was used to fund some of BLF\u2019s pre-festival programmes engaging local Muslim women on their aspirations and literacy. While I am sure the programmes were beneficial to participants, it is highly problematic to suggest that the people the projects engage are at risk of becoming extremists due solely to their identity. It is rooted in the counter-radicalisation thesis that suggests that since any Muslim could become violent, all Muslims require monitoring. It reduces Muslims to subjects requiring de-radicalisation. Bradford\u2019s predominantly Pakistani, Muslim population has long been looked at through a lens of criminality. Not only does BSBT look at the community through that same lens but it also entails a level of information collection, because it requires reporting on outcomes. There is no guarantee how that information is used or stored. BSBT requires recipients to show \u201cdemonstrable outcomes which provide a positive alternative to extremist voices\u201d, thus framing the festival as less of a community-centred space of art and discussion and more as a deliberate, targeted strategy \u2013 one that insinuates that Muslim women\u2019s educational and literacy levels correlate to extremism. Counter-extremism works largely to hide the material conditions that disenfranchise people, which may lead them to express grievances violently \u2013 including austerity, poverty, structural racism, Islamophobia and more. A government could seek to change these rather than funnelling money into an apparatus that approaches Muslims as a suspect community living in a vacuum. This is particularly pernicious in the austerity context, where government has pulled money from arts and culture and cut local council budgets so that spaces such as libraries and community centres are on the decline. It means counter-extremism becomes one of very few pots of funding that groups such as BLF feel they can draw on to create those missing spaces. This makes organisations dependent on counter-extremism funding. We refuse to give credibility to the idea there is demand for such funds. Some have argued that we should express this opinion at the festival, but this counter-extremism strategy would only gain more credibility if it could be said dissenting voices were given space to speak under its banner. I refuse to normalise it as an acceptable way to work with marginalised Muslim communities. With others who have withdrawn, I want to expose the pernicious way counter-extremism works. We don\u2019t want BLF to stop running, we want it to continue, but in such a way that the local community\u2019s trust is not breached, art is not securitised, our concerns are properly met and acknowledged, and the government\u2019s agenda is resisted so that funds relating to arts and culture, not policing and counter-extremism, are what prop up an important festival like this. \u2022 Suhaiymah Manzoor-Khan is an author, spoken-word poet and educator Saima Mir: Boycotting the festival is like withholding bread while we wait for cake When I was young, I believed the good fight was fought bare-knuckled.

Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate, Johnson said only that it was 'eminently feasible', although he then went on to tell TalkRadio that the 31 October deadline was 'do or die'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members. Johnson\u2019s camp insist it would be part of a wider \u2013 and so far unknown \u2013 package of tax changes.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Public spending</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has said relatively little, beyond promising a fairly small increase in schools funding, as well as talking about the need to roll out fast broadband across the country. Johnson has generally hinted he would loosen the purse strings, but given his prior fondness for big-ticket projects \u2013 London\u2019s cancelled garden bridge, the mooted 'Boris island' airport \u2013 perhaps expect more of a focus on infrastructure projects than services.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Climate and environment</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is unlikely to be a big issue for Conservative party members, and Johnson has not said much on this beyond confirming his general support for the new government target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Foreign policy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Also unlikely to be a big issue among Tory members, beyond vague platitudes on 'global Britain', it could be a weak spot for Johnson given his poor performance as foreign secretary.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Hunt has stepped up his criticism of Boris Johnson for avoiding media scrutiny in the Tory leadership campaign, calling it \u201cdisrespectful\u201d, as another minister said Johnson could be brought down by his own MPs if he pushed for a no-deal Brexit. Tobias Ellwood, the junior defence minister, said it was possible that the decision by Johnson actively to seek no deal could push some Conservatives to support a no-confidence motion against his government. \u201cI believe that absolutely is the case,\u201d Ellwood told the BBC. \u201cI think a dozen or so members of parliament would be on our side, would be voting against supporting a no deal and that would include ministers as well as backbenchers.\u201d Following a hugely difficult weekend for the Johnson campaign, dominated by questions about why police were called to his home after an argument with his partner, Carrie Symonds, allies of the former foreign secretary sought to fight his corner. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who supported Johnson after abandoning his own leadership bid, said it was \u201cnonsense\u201d to accuse the frontrunner of avoiding scrutiny, saying he was taking part in dozens of Conservative hustings events. Priti Patel, the former international development secretary and another leading Johnson supporter, told the BBC that Johnson was facing \u201ca very clear, politically motivated series of attacks\u201d over the incident on Thursday night at the London home he shares with Symonds. Johnson has refused to comment on the circumstances of a furious row that led one neighbour to record some of the shouting from inside his flat, and informed the Guardian about the incident. Other neighbours said they had considered calling police. \u201cThe very prospect of someone taping someone in their private home, frankly, tells me that is politically motivated,\u201d Patel said. \u201cAnd that is not the type of behaviour that you would expect in our country. It\u2019s the type of behaviour associated with the old Eastern Bloc.\u201d Patel said such incidents were \u201cvery much there to deflect upon the fact he is a Brexit candidate\u201d. She said: \u201cQuite frankly this has now become very much, I think, remain versus leave, and a personal attack and campaign against Boris.\u201d Speaking earlier to Sky News, Hunt declined to comment on the incident with Symonds, saying only: \u201cHe\u2019s got to decide what he says about his private life.\u201d But Hunt was scathing about Johnson\u2019s decision to avoid almost all media interviews and debates, calling it \u201cvery disrespectful to Conservative party members\u201d. Johnson has agreed to take part in an ITV event on 9 July, by which point party members will have received their ballots. But he is avoiding a planned Sky debate on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m saying that it is cowardice, frankly, not to appear in head-to-head debates against me,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cYou can\u2019t become prime minister without answering questions about the decisions you\u2019re going to have to take almost immediately you get through the door of No 10. My worry is that Boris has got a coalition of people like Matt Hancock, who want no deal taken off the table, and Mark Francois, who wants no deal \u2013 that coalition will dissolve very, very quickly indeed when he has to take some actual decisions. \u201cSometimes in politics you can fudge, but on Brexit you can\u2019t. There are going to have to be decisions, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s very important that the new prime minister has a mandate from having spelled out exactly what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d Hunt also accused Johnson of appearing willing to \u201cslink through the back door\u201d of No 10 by \u201cpathetically\u201d evading questioning. \u201cDon\u2019t be a coward, Boris, man up,\u201d he wrote in Monday\u2019s edition of the Times. Warnings such as those from Ellwood about no-confidence motions made proper scrutiny all the more necessary, Hunt argued: \u201cIn that situation, is he going to have an election in order to get a majority in parliament for a no-deal Brexit? I think Conservative party members need to know the answer to those questions.\u201d Defending Johnson on BBC1\u2019s Breakfast, Hancock said the dozen-plus party hustings and other events amounted to \u201cendless and constant scrutiny\u201d. Hancock added: \u201cOf course, the question of whether Boris\u2019s private life is private is, perfectly reasonably, up to him. I don\u2019t think anybody would like their conversations late at night to be listened in to and snooped on by a neighbour.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Hunt has joined calls for Boris Johnson to explain why police were called to his home after an argument with his partner by warning that his Conservative leadership rival \u201cneeds to show he can answer difficult questions\u201d. The foreign secretary followed cabinet ministers, backbenchers and a major party donor in demanding that the frontrunner to succeed Theresa May speak out about the loud, late-night altercation with his partner, Carrie Symonds, which was heard by several neighbours. Hunt intervened as Johnson came under pressure on several fronts: \u2022 Two other cabinet ministers demanded that Johnson explain what happened on Friday. \u2022 A senior member of the 1922 Committee called for \u201copenness\u201d from anyone standing to be prime minister. \u2022 A party donor expressed concerns about the argument, saying it would damage their long-term prospects. Hunt\u2019s comment over Johnson\u2019s refusal to engage with the media will be seen as a coded reference to his opponent\u2019s appearance at Saturday\u2019s leadership race hustings, in which he stonewalled persistent questions about the incident, which took place early on Friday. The former mayor of London is due to take part in a digital hustings with Tory party members on Monday and has refused to say if he will face Hunt in a televised Sky News debate on Tuesday. Hunt suggested Johnson shied away from scrutiny, telling Sky News: \u201cThis is an audition to be prime minister of the UK \u2026 If Boris is refusing to answer questions in the media, refusing to do live debates then of course people are thinking: just who are we going to get as PM?\u201d Hunt also accused Johnson of appearing willing to \u201cslink through the back door\u201d of No 10 by \u201cpathetically\u201d evading questioning. \u201cDon\u2019t be a coward Boris, man up,\u201d he wrote in Monday\u2019s edition of the Times. The story emerged after a neighbour told the Guardian he had been so concerned by a loud, late-night altercation between Johnson and Symonds that he had felt obliged to call the police. Other neighbours confirmed the argument took place and said they had been concerned by its intensity.

I think that if you are standing for the role of prime minister, the nation has a reasonable expectation that this kind of issue [around personal behaviour] must be cleared up,\u201d he said. One Tory donor, who has given more than \u00a3500,000, told the Guardian that the issue was damaging the party. \u201cWe are a laughing stock,\u201d he said. Gove, the environment secretary and a rival of Johnson, declined to make any comment on the issue, but did not rule out doing so in the future. \u201cI think it is best if I say nothing at this stage,\u201d he said. Police confirmed they were called to the couple\u2019s south London flat after an argument was heard by neighbours, who reported slamming and banging, and added that at one point Symonds could be heard telling Johnson to \u201cget off me\u201d and \u201cget out of my flat\u201d. A poll conducted at the weekend showed support for Johnson had fallen sharply following the incident. His eight-point lead earlier in the week had fallen to three points behind Hunt.

Penn, a playwright, said he acted only as a last resort and that he was speaking out because he was concerned by the \u201cbizarre and fictitious allegations\u201d made about him and his wife. Several Tory MPs have criticised the actions of Penn and claimed that his complaint was politically motivated because his partner has expressed hostility on social media towards Johnson. According to the Mail, Symonds described the recordings as a \u201cpolitical stitch up\u201d. But Penn has said they were motivated only by concern for the welfare of those in the flat. Dame Vera Baird, who will become the next victims\u2019 commissioner of England and Wales on Monday, told the Guardian that neighbours were right to contact the police with their concerns. \u201cI am in no doubt at all that given what they [the neighbours] said they heard, they should have done what they did \u2013 knock on the door, and try and offer any personal help, and then, when they got no reply, call the police.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods. This has also been referred to by government ministers as an \"Australia-style deal\". Australia does not have a free trade agreement with the EU.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Morgan and Hands say in the foreword to the report that the interim recommendations reflect the commission\u2019s commitment to find solutions \u201ccompatible with any of the potential Brexit outcomes\u201d including the current withdrawal agreement.</p> \n<p>The report found that any alternative arrangements must recognise \u201cthe supremacy of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement\u201d (GFA) and the preservation of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/travelling-in-the-common-travel-area-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/travelling-within-the-common-travel-area-and-the-associated-rights-of-british-and-irish-citizens-if-there-is-no-brexit-deal\">the common travel area</a>.</p> \n<p>They should also recognise the need for a trade policy in the UK that is independent of the EU, and the need to ensure east-west trade flows as easily as possible.</p> \n<p>The report also states that all future proposals \u201cmust be based on consent\u201d, one of the central tenets of the GFA and a recognition of the two heritages in Northern Ireland.

      "bodyText": "Alternative arrangements for keeping the Irish border open in the event of a no-deal Brexit or the collapse of future trade talks with the EU could be up and running within three years, a report concludes. The interim report by a non-government organisation calling itself the Alternative Arrangements Commission will be unveiled at a special conference on the Irish border in London on Monday. Their conclusions suggest that the UK would only need the Irish border backstop contained in the withdrawal agreement until 2022, if work on such arrangements started today. Backed by remain-voting Conservative party MPs Nicky Morgan and Greg Hands, the report makes eight interim recommendations following consultation with business, politicians and economic experts, including commercial interests in Northern Ireland. It suggests special economic zones \u201ccovering frontier traffic and national security offer potentially valuable solutions\u201d which it said would respect the realities of the border. The report addresses key issues including the vexed question of health checks on any live animals, animal or plant produce crossing the border, including milk, pigs and sheep. The report says \u201csanitary and phytosanitary (SPS)\u201d tests could be carried out by mobile units away from the border. This would require politicians in the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) to accept checks on farms and in food-production plants and related facilities, something they have opposed so far. Among the other recommendations are the creation of a multi-tier trusted trader programme for large and small companies, with exemptions for small companies. This was proposed by the government in August 2017 and dismissed by the EU. One of the major challenges for the EU and the UK in keeping the border invisible is the issue of standards on food and food processing currently governed by EU regulations. Under mandatory EU rules checks have to be done at the border at special inspection posts with facilities for lab testing and refrigeration to guard against cross-border infection on everything from salmonella to mad cow disease. Such are the rules that in the event of no deal, the EU milk from Northern Ireland will not be permissible in cheese, butter or infant formula made south of the border from day one, potentially devastating the dairy sector which sends 30% of its milk to the republic. Morgan and Hands say in the foreword to the report that the interim recommendations reflect the commission\u2019s commitment to find solutions \u201ccompatible with any of the potential Brexit outcomes\u201d including the current withdrawal agreement. The report found that any alternative arrangements must recognise \u201cthe supremacy of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement\u201d (GFA) and the preservation of the common travel area. They should also recognise the need for a trade policy in the UK that is independent of the EU, and the need to ensure east-west trade flows as easily as possible. The report also states that all future proposals \u201cmust be based on consent\u201d, one of the central tenets of the GFA and a recognition of the two heritages in Northern Ireland. Common all-island regimes should continue and where possible \u201cbuilt upon\u201d. Special arrangements such as special economic zones and common SPS regimes could \u201cpotentially span not only the island of Ireland\u201d but also Britain with a common rule book, like the Australia-New Zealand Food Safety Area. The report suggests such an arrangement would allow Ireland to break the EU\u2019s common rule book if the UK diverged from EU standards and regulations. This would, for instance, apply if the UK decided to do a trade deal with the US enabling chlorinated chicken to enter the country. This, it notes, would need checks in harbours, ports and airports in Northern Ireland to protect the entire island of Ireland, but this should be a decision for the Northern Ireland assembly. This scenario is predicated on Ireland having a side deal with the EU for a common rule book on the two countries and suggests Ireland would have the unilateral power to deviate from this, even though the EU is based on a system of rules that apply to all member states and not just one. Last October the DUP rejected any checks at ports or airports in Northern Ireland, arguing it would cut the region off from the rest of the UK, while the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, struck a similar position saying the government would \u201cnever ever allow a border down the Irish Sea\u201d. And last week the government finally released a mapping exercise which showed the extent to which the border issue impacted non-trade issues with 142 issues including healthcare for heart patients. The commission was set up by Prosperity UK, an organisation created in 2017 that describes itself as an independent platform bringing together business, academics and policymakers to look constructively at the UK\u2019s future outside the EU. It said it welcomed the opportunity for feedback so it could \u201crefine\u201d its recommendations. Northern Ireland Retail Consortium director, Aodh\u00e1n Connolly aid economic freezones would create borders within borders. He expressed scepticism about how the alternative arrangements could comply with the December 2017 joint commitment between the EU and the UK to avoid \u201ca hard border, including any infrastructure or related checks and controls\u201d. \u201cThe solutions proffered add complexity and costs that will make business in NI less competitive and in some cases unviable. But with all that said this is a step forward and it provides some much needed informed debate on the issue,\u201d he added.",
