He masturbated himself while masturbating them. About one month later, as he passed one of the boys in a corridor of the church, Pell pushed the boy against a wall and forcefully squeezed his genitals.</p> \n<p>The allegations had been the prosecution\u2019s to prove. Many of the witnesses called were now elderly. Former choirboys who gave evidence struggled to remember details about the choir procession and the church layout more than two decades after the fact.

Guilty was their response to all five charges after just over three days of deliberation. A courtroom that included about eight journalists, a Jesuit priest, a former Australian ambassador to the Vatican, and a handful of abuse advocates and Pell supporters sat stunned by the magnitude and import of those words.</p> \n<p>Cardinal George Pell was guilty. On every count.</p> \n<h2><strong>Two trials \u2013 one verdict</strong></h2> \n<p>The trial in Melbourne, described as the \u201ccathedral trial\u201d, was not Pell\u2019s first.</p> \n<p>In August he faced the county court on the same charges he was eventually convicted of. That trial lasted for almost five weeks and resulted in a hung jury. A mistrial was declared, with several of the jurors in tears as the forewoman told the court\u2019s chief judge, Peter Kidd, they could not come to either a unanimous or a majority 11-to-one verdict.</p> \n<p>A retrial began in November 2018 with a strict suppression order in place preventing any reporting of both the previous case and the retrial. That was because Pell faced further, separate, charges known as the \u201cswimmers trial\u201d in a case due to be heard this April.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/dec/14/suppression-orders-australia-why-you-cant-read-what-you-may-want-to\">Suppression orders are common</a> in child sexual abuse cases and this was no different. The order was lifted after so-called tendency evidence prosecutors were relying on using in the swimmers trial was on Friday deemed inadmissible by Kidd<strong>. </strong>Their chances of successfully prosecuting the case were significantly impeded, and on Tuesday they announced that the trial would be dropped. The suppression on the cathedral trial was then lifted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"75b41936-8257-417b-a18c-15b26c04b2a4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lr6v9QGhNeU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It can now be revealed that Pell was convicted of four charges of an indecent act on a child under the age of 16, and one charge of sexual penetration of a child under 16.</p> \n<p>The prosecution, led by the crown barrister Mark Gibson, said those acts had occurred some time in the second half of 1996 after mass at the Melbourne cathedral, within months of Pell\u2019s inauguration as archbishop.</p> \n<p>Two choirboys had finished their singing duties and decided to have some fun, the court heard. They slipped away from the choir procession as it exited the cathedral shortly after completing mass at noon, and made their way back into the building through the south-side entry. They walked down a corridor leading to the sacristies \u2013 the private rooms, off limits to the public, and used by priests and the archbishop to robe and disrobe in.</p> \n<p>In the sacristy they found sacramental wine in an unlocked wooden cupboard, and each took a few swigs.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were excited, feeling mischievous,\u201d the complainant, who cannot be named, told the court. \u201cI\u2019d never been in this room before.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was then that Pell walked in, still in his robes.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe was alone. He planted himself in the doorway and said something like, \u2018What are you doing in here?\u2019 or \u2018You\u2019re in trouble,\u2019\u201d the complainant said. \u201cThere was this moment where we all just sort of froze, and then he undid his trousers or his belt, like he started moving underneath his robes.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pell pulled out his penis and approached the other boy, grabbing his head.</p> \n<p>The complainant asked Pell, \u201cCan you let us go? We didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI could see his [the boy\u2019s] head being lowered towards his [Pell\u2019s] genitalia,\u201d the complainant recalled. \u201cThen he sort of started squirming, he was struggling. His head was being controlled and it was down near archbishop Pell\u2019s genitals. I was no more than a couple of metres away.\u201d</p> \n<p>This took place for about a minute or two. Pell stopped and turned to the complainant.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd then he put his penis into my mouth. Archbishop Pell was standing, he was erect, and he pushed it into my mouth. He instructed me to undo my pants and take off my pants, and I did that. And then he started touching my genitalia. Archbishop Pell was touching himself on his penis with his other hand.\u201d</p> \n<p>When it was over the complainant, in shock, pulled up his pants. The boys left the room and tried to rejoin the procession before returning their robes.</p> \n<p>About a month later, again after Sunday solemn mass, Pell passed the complainant in a corridor of the church and attacked. He pushed the boy against a wall and forcefully squeezed his genitals through his choir robes.</p> \n<p>\u201cNothing was said,\u201d the complainant said. \u201cIt was all within a matter of seconds.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>\u2018Pell has terrified me my whole life\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>The media and public were barred from being present during the complainant\u2019s evidence, as is standard in sexual assault cases to protect the victim from reliving their trauma in front of an audience.</p> \n<p>But his police statement, made in June 2015, and his evidence to the court via video link were quoted throughout the trial. The other boy involved died in 2014 from a heroin overdose. He never reported the abuse to police.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"08383f99dce592c0588ea6e75d114ebbec875a1d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08383f99dce592c0588ea6e75d114ebbec875a1d/0_0_4293_2863/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the media surround Pell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the media surround Pell after his first court appearance in July 2017.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Castro/AAP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The surviving complainant said it had taken him two decades to go to police because he had immediately pushed the attack to the \u201cdarkest recesses\u201d of his mind. Being in the choir was a condition of the complainant\u2019s competitive scholarship to attend St Kevin\u2019s College, an elite independent school in the affluent inner-Melbourne suburb of Toorak. His parents were going through a divorce, and his losing the scholarship would upset them.</p> \n<p>\u201cI knew a scholarship could be given or taken away even at that age,\u201d he told the court. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want to lose that. It meant so much to me and my family. And what would I do if I said such a thing about an archbishop?</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s something I carried with me the whole of my life. I refrained from telling anyone. I was young and didn\u2019t really know what had happened to me.

I\u2019ve been struggling with this a long time \u2026 and my ability to be here. Because I think Pell has terrified me my whole life \u2026 he was [later] in the Vatican. He was an extremely, presidentially powerful guy who had a lot of connections.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prosecutors said the complainant was a believable witness who provided reliable evidence. They said the overall evidence from choirboys, altar servers, the choir master and master of ceremonies, Charles Portelli, about the layout of the church, and whether Pell would have the opportunity to offend, fitted with the complainant\u2019s account rather than discredited it.</p> \n<h2><strong>\u2018You wouldn\u2019t hang a chicken on this evidence\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>Pell\u2019s defence was led by Robert Richter, a formidable defence barrister with a booming voice, known for his sometimes theatrical interrogation style. Previously he has successfully represented notorious underworld figures, and his legal team is estimated to have cost Pell about $50,000 a day.</p> \n<p>Richter told the jurors that the offences could not and did not happen.</p> \n<p>He said the case against Pell was made up of improbabilities, which could only lead jurors to finding that the alleged offences were \u201cimpossible\u201d and defied common sense.</p> \n<p>They were the product of \u201cfantasy\u201d, Richter said, because Pell had never been alone during mass while he was archbishop of Melbourne.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>How would he know the other boy wouldn\u2019t be running out of the room, raising the alarm or running away in tears?</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Robert Richter, defence barrister</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Richter told the jurors Pell was always surrounded by people and accompanied by Portelli during Sunday solemn mass, which he described as a \u201cproduction\u201d involving dignitaries, congregants and tourists. This made it impossible that Pell could have abused two boys unnoticed, Richter said.</p> \n<p>After mass Pell would often stand on the church steps, meeting and greeting parishioners, witnesses confirmed. Portelli would then accompany him to the sacristies to help him disrobe. Some former church staff told the court the sacristy would be bustling after mass, with altar servers locking away precious vessels and chalices.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like the Queen, I suppose, the Queen when she is robed is never unattended, she\u2019s not expecting to dress and get undressed on her own \u2026 there are always attendants and it\u2019s that sort of situation,\u201d Richter said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"947d86161c7a9e0c2bc8fbea48e3f18b327c3be6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/947d86161c7a9e0c2bc8fbea48e3f18b327c3be6/0_90_1916_2393/801.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Richter\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Richter, Pell\u2019s high-profile defence barrister, outside court in March last year.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Con Chronis/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Why would Pell risk abusing two boys in his first months in the high-profile role as Melbourne\u2019s archbishop, argued Richter and his assistant, the defence barrister Ruth Shann.</p> \n<p>It was a time when the Catholic church was embroiled in scandal. Notorious paedophile priests including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/31/paedophile-priest-gerald-ridsdale-sentenced-to-11-more-years-in-jail\">Gerald Ridsdale</a> \u2013 once a friend of Pell\u2019s \u2013 had by then been convicted of more than 70 charges of abusing children.</p> \n<p>Once anointed as archbishop in August 1996, Pell took action to address the scandals by announcing the Melbourne Response, the Catholic archdiocese of Melbourne\u2019s program to address child sexual abuse allegations. The program has since been widely criticised by abuse survivors and their families.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cb860109-e486-4b5e-9d6b-3696132efce6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b3qwjGIEq8g?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Nonetheless, Richter said, Pell was a man doing his best to tackle abuse and would not have risked his reputation by abusing two boys at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral as a new archbishop.</p> \n<p>In the retrial, Richter resorted to using a PowerPoint presentation during his closing address to drill his point home, a move that surprised many in the courtroom. One slide flashed on the screen that simply read: \u201cOnly a madman would attempt to rape two boys in the priests sacristy immediately after Sunday solemn mass.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kidd allowed the PowerPoint, but barred Richter from using a video animation during his closing address, saying it risked leading the jury to believe that what was being shown was fact, and new evidence was not allowed to be shown during closing addresses.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"748754de-fed9-430a-9da5-9339488169ad\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(February 25, 1941)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Pell is born in the Victorian town of Ballarat.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(February 25, 1972)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Pell returns as a parish priest to Ballarat, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/04/ronald-mulkearns-bishop-accused-of-child-sex-abuse-cover-up-dies\">abuse is widespread</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(February 25, 1973)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Pell&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/20/ballarat-prepares-for-child-sexual-abuse-inquiry-while-cardinal-pell-stays-away\">lives with the paedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale</a>.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(February 25, 1993)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Pell supports Ridsdale at a court appearance for child sex offences.

      "bodyText": "It was at 3.45pm on Tuesday 11 December that Cardinal George Pell, one of Pope Francis\u2019s most trusted officials and the third most senior Catholic in the world, found out that he would, in all likelihood, be going to jail. Room 4.3 at the county court in Melbourne was silent as the jury foreman delivered the verdict which \u2013 now that a strict suppression order on the case has been lifted \u2013 will send shockwaves across the global Catholic congregation. Pell, the Vatican treasurer, was guilty of sexually assaulting two boys. As each of the five charges was read out, and as each time the foreman of the jury confirmed his guilt, Pell sat in the dock, head bowed, staring forward, nodding his head slightly. Despite the cardinal\u2019s assertions that the charges against him were a series of \u201cderanged falsehoods\u201d, despite having brought together a formidable defence team led by the high-profile and expensive barrister Robert Richter QC, and with the crux of the prosecution\u2019s case hinging on the evidence of just one complainant, the jury was unanimous. They believed the complainant\u2019s account that some time in December 1996, after presiding over Sunday solemn mass at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral as archbishop of Melbourne, Pell forced his penis into the mouth of two 13-year-old boys. He masturbated himself while masturbating them. About one month later, as he passed one of the boys in a corridor of the church, Pell pushed the boy against a wall and forcefully squeezed his genitals. The allegations had been the prosecution\u2019s to prove. Many of the witnesses called were now elderly. Former choirboys who gave evidence struggled to remember details about the choir procession and the church layout more than two decades after the fact. To convict Pell, the jury had to believe without doubt that the complainant was reliable and honest. They did. Guilty was their response to all five charges after just over three days of deliberation. A courtroom that included about eight journalists, a Jesuit priest, a former Australian ambassador to the Vatican, and a handful of abuse advocates and Pell supporters sat stunned by the magnitude and import of those words. Cardinal George Pell was guilty. On every count. Two trials \u2013 one verdict The trial in Melbourne, described as the \u201ccathedral trial\u201d, was not Pell\u2019s first. In August he faced the county court on the same charges he was eventually convicted of. That trial lasted for almost five weeks and resulted in a hung jury. A mistrial was declared, with several of the jurors in tears as the forewoman told the court\u2019s chief judge, Peter Kidd, they could not come to either a unanimous or a majority 11-to-one verdict. A retrial began in November 2018 with a strict suppression order in place preventing any reporting of both the previous case and the retrial. That was because Pell faced further, separate, charges known as the \u201cswimmers trial\u201d in a case due to be heard this April. Suppression orders are common in child sexual abuse cases and this was no different. The order was lifted after so-called tendency evidence prosecutors were relying on using in the swimmers trial was on Friday deemed inadmissible by Kidd. Their chances of successfully prosecuting the case were significantly impeded, and on Tuesday they announced that the trial would be dropped. The suppression on the cathedral trial was then lifted. It can now be revealed that Pell was convicted of four charges of an indecent act on a child under the age of 16, and one charge of sexual penetration of a child under 16. The prosecution, led by the crown barrister Mark Gibson, said those acts had occurred some time in the second half of 1996 after mass at the Melbourne cathedral, within months of Pell\u2019s inauguration as archbishop. Two choirboys had finished their singing duties and decided to have some fun, the court heard. They slipped away from the choir procession as it exited the cathedral shortly after completing mass at noon, and made their way back into the building through the south-side entry. They walked down a corridor leading to the sacristies \u2013 the private rooms, off limits to the public, and used by priests and the archbishop to robe and disrobe in. In the sacristy they found sacramental wine in an unlocked wooden cupboard, and each took a few swigs. \u201cWe were excited, feeling mischievous,\u201d the complainant, who cannot be named, told the court. \u201cI\u2019d never been in this room before.\u201d It was then that Pell walked in, still in his robes. \u201cHe was alone. He planted himself in the doorway and said something like, \u2018What are you doing in here?\u2019 or \u2018You\u2019re in trouble,\u2019\u201d the complainant said. \u201cThere was this moment where we all just sort of froze, and then he undid his trousers or his belt, like he started moving underneath his robes.\u201d Pell pulled out his penis and approached the other boy, grabbing his head. The complainant asked Pell, \u201cCan you let us go? We didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d \u201cI could see his [the boy\u2019s] head being lowered towards his [Pell\u2019s] genitalia,\u201d the complainant recalled. \u201cThen he sort of started squirming, he was struggling. His head was being controlled and it was down near archbishop Pell\u2019s genitals. I was no more than a couple of metres away.\u201d This took place for about a minute or two. Pell stopped and turned to the complainant. \u201cAnd then he put his penis into my mouth. Archbishop Pell was standing, he was erect, and he pushed it into my mouth. He instructed me to undo my pants and take off my pants, and I did that. And then he started touching my genitalia. Archbishop Pell was touching himself on his penis with his other hand.\u201d When it was over the complainant, in shock, pulled up his pants. The boys left the room and tried to rejoin the procession before returning their robes. About a month later, again after Sunday solemn mass, Pell passed the complainant in a corridor of the church and attacked. He pushed the boy against a wall and forcefully squeezed his genitals through his choir robes. \u201cNothing was said,\u201d the complainant said. \u201cIt was all within a matter of seconds.\u201d \u2018Pell has terrified me my whole life\u2019 The media and public were barred from being present during the complainant\u2019s evidence, as is standard in sexual assault cases to protect the victim from reliving their trauma in front of an audience. But his police statement, made in June 2015, and his evidence to the court via video link were quoted throughout the trial. The other boy involved died in 2014 from a heroin overdose. He never reported the abuse to police. The surviving complainant said it had taken him two decades to go to police because he had immediately pushed the attack to the \u201cdarkest recesses\u201d of his mind. Being in the choir was a condition of the complainant\u2019s competitive scholarship to attend St Kevin\u2019s College, an elite independent school in the affluent inner-Melbourne suburb of Toorak. His parents were going through a divorce, and his losing the scholarship would upset them. \u201cI knew a scholarship could be given or taken away even at that age,\u201d he told the court. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want to lose that. It meant so much to me and my family. And what would I do if I said such a thing about an archbishop? \u201cIt\u2019s something I carried with me the whole of my life. I refrained from telling anyone. I was young and didn\u2019t really know what had happened to me. I didn\u2019t know what it was, if it was normal.\u201d In his police statement, the complainant said he remembered Pell as \u201cbeing a big force in the place\u201d. \u201cHe emanated an air of being a powerful person. I\u2019ve been struggling with this a long time \u2026 and my ability to be here. Because I think Pell has terrified me my whole life \u2026 he was [later] in the Vatican. He was an extremely, presidentially powerful guy who had a lot of connections.\u201d Prosecutors said the complainant was a believable witness who provided reliable evidence. They said the overall evidence from choirboys, altar servers, the choir master and master of ceremonies, Charles Portelli, about the layout of the church, and whether Pell would have the opportunity to offend, fitted with the complainant\u2019s account rather than discredited it. \u2018You wouldn\u2019t hang a chicken on this evidence\u2019 Pell\u2019s defence was led by Robert Richter, a formidable defence barrister with a booming voice, known for his sometimes theatrical interrogation style. Previously he has successfully represented notorious underworld figures, and his legal team is estimated to have cost Pell about $50,000 a day. Richter told the jurors that the offences could not and did not happen. He said the case against Pell was made up of improbabilities, which could only lead jurors to finding that the alleged offences were \u201cimpossible\u201d and defied common sense. They were the product of \u201cfantasy\u201d, Richter said, because Pell had never been alone during mass while he was archbishop of Melbourne. Richter told the jurors Pell was always surrounded by people and accompanied by Portelli during Sunday solemn mass, which he described as a \u201cproduction\u201d involving dignitaries, congregants and tourists. This made it impossible that Pell could have abused two boys unnoticed, Richter said. After mass Pell would often stand on the church steps, meeting and greeting parishioners, witnesses confirmed. Portelli would then accompany him to the sacristies to help him disrobe. Some former church staff told the court the sacristy would be bustling after mass, with altar servers locking away precious vessels and chalices. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like the Queen, I suppose, the Queen when she is robed is never unattended, she\u2019s not expecting to dress and get undressed on her own \u2026 there are always attendants and it\u2019s that sort of situation,\u201d Richter said. Why would Pell risk abusing two boys in his first months in the high-profile role as Melbourne\u2019s archbishop, argued Richter and his assistant, the defence barrister Ruth Shann. It was a time when the Catholic church was embroiled in scandal. Notorious paedophile priests including Gerald Ridsdale \u2013 once a friend of Pell\u2019s \u2013 had by then been convicted of more than 70 charges of abusing children. Once anointed as archbishop in August 1996, Pell took action to address the scandals by announcing the Melbourne Response, the Catholic archdiocese of Melbourne\u2019s program to address child sexual abuse allegations. The program has since been widely criticised by abuse survivors and their families. Nonetheless, Richter said, Pell was a man doing his best to tackle abuse and would not have risked his reputation by abusing two boys at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral as a new archbishop. In the retrial, Richter resorted to using a PowerPoint presentation during his closing address to drill his point home, a move that surprised many in the courtroom. One slide flashed on the screen that simply read: \u201cOnly a madman would attempt to rape two boys in the priests sacristy immediately after Sunday solemn mass.\u201d Kidd allowed the PowerPoint, but barred Richter from using a video animation during his closing address, saying it risked leading the jury to believe that what was being shown was fact, and new evidence was not allowed to be shown during closing addresses. The madman theory Pell was not mad, Richter told the jurors, but he would have to be if he had sexually assaulted two boys. \u201cThe next aspect of the madman theory is there is nothing to prevent one boy running screaming from the room while the other is under attack,\u201d he told them. \u201cHow would Pell know that was not going to happen? How would he know the other boy wouldn\u2019t be running out of the room, raising the alarm or running away in tears?\u201d If Pell really wanted to abuse two boys, Richter added, he would have taken them to his private office after discovering them in the sacristy, where he could attack them behind a locked door. Richter told jurors it was unfathomable that the boys would not have spoken to each other or anyone else about the abuse afterwards . \u201cIt makes no sense because it did not happen,\u201d Richter said. It also made no sense that two boys could \u201cnick off\u201d from a procession and sneak back into the church unnoticed by other choirboys, church staff or adults. \u201cThe prosecution case is cherry picking bits of evidence saying, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s possible to do this, it\u2019s possible that this happened.\u2019 The crown case is built on speculation. You would not hang a chicken on that, let alone decide a man\u2019s fate.\u201d But some of the choirboys gave evidence that the procession after mass was not always orderly and that they might not have noticed two of their number slipping away. Boys were keen to disrobe and leave. One choirboy said that once the choir had processed outside and reached a certain point, it was \u201cgame on\u201d. Another former choirboy said once the procession had passed through the outside gate, children would relax and move out of line. Gibson, the crown barrister, said no one remembered two boys \u201cnicking off\u201d because nobody had noticed them leave. It would only be remembered as a remarkable event had someone seen it, he said. But Richter told jurors that even if two children managed to sneak back into the church after mass and enter the sacristy unseen, the sacristy would have been a \u201chive of activity\u201d, and the long-serving sacristan Max Potter would have been there. They would have been caught, he said. He also told jurors to consider that Australia had no extradition treaty with the Vatican, and that Pell had returned to Australia to face trial of his own accord. The drama of the court The battle between the defence and prosecution \u2013 between Richter and Gibson \u2013 gripped not only those in court, but also some outside. That Pell was the most high-profile person in the Vatican to be charged with such offences at the time of his arrest was inescapable. Barristers from unrelated cases being heard in other courtrooms came in to listen. Throughout the first trial Pell sat in the dock, often writing notes as evidence was given. By the retrial in November, the notepad was largely gone, he was no longer able to sit and stand as the jury exited and entered owing to a knee problem, and he was using a walking cane to get around. After a couple of former church staff who gave evidence shook hands with Pell on their way out of the courtroom during the first trial, it was ordered that future witnesses walk to and from the stand, avoiding the dock \u2013 to prevent any interaction that might influence the jurors. When the court adjourned each day for lunch, Pell sat with his legal team, guarded by security staff, in a tiny meeting room adjacent to the courtroom, eating sausage rolls, milkshakes and sandwiches. He did not venture outside during breaks. Jurors were selected from 250 people who came into the court during the empanelment process. Kidd was concerned that it would be difficult to find a group of impartial people who did not have biases towards or against Pell or the church. There were concerns about not having the requisite 12 for a verdict if jurors became sick during the lengthy five-week trial, leading to 14 jurors being selected. Before jury deliberations, two jurors were balloted off. Four women and eight men remained, among them a church pastor and a secondary school teacher. It was always going to be a tough case to prove. Not only were prosecutors grappling with the passage of time, but before he died in 2014 the other alleged victim told his mother he was never sexually abused. Prosecutors called about two dozen witnesses throughout the trial, many of them former choirboys, who had to try to conjure memories from their childhood and teenage years. Their responses to questioning were often \u201cI don\u2019t remember\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t recall\u201d. It meant that the prosecution pinned its case against Pell almost entirely on the evidence of one person \u2013 the complainant. The summation In his succinct but powerful closing remarks, Gibson asked the jury to consider how the complainant would have known the layout of the priest\u2019s sacristy, and that there were wooden panels, a storage cupboard, a kitchenette and sacramental wine in there. It was not a place choirboys were allowed to enter. Yet the complainant was able to describe the room. \u201cYou might ask yourselves how would he know that unless he was in there,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cHow does he know about the concealed alcove area without actually being there? How does he know it\u2019s a storage-kitchenette kind of thing and there being a wood-panelled area if he\u2019s not been in there? \u201cHow does [the complainant] know that that was where the wine was kept?\u201d He asked jurors to consider the overall impression the complainant left them with. \u201cDid he strike you as an honest witness? In our submission he was not a person indulging in a fantasy or inventing things to a point where he now believes his own inventive mind. He was simply someone telling it how it was and is. A person genuinely recounting events experienced as a 13-year-old through the eyes of a 34-year-old.\u201d \u2018Not a trial of the Catholic church\u2019 For his part, Richter told jurors that this was a trial of a high-profile man who should not be be forced to take the blame for the failings of the organisation he helped to lead. \u201cYou would have had to live on the moon to not be aware of it,\u201d Richter had told jurors. \u201cArchbishop Pell was portrayed as the Darth Vader of the Catholic church.\u201d The failings of the Catholic church and accusations that church leaders failed children, combined with Pell\u2019s profile, was \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d, he said. But he added: \u201cThis is not a trial of the Catholic church. Cardinal Pell is not here to answer for failings of various clerics. This is a trial of Cardinal Pell for performing abominable acts.\u201d Kidd, a judge respected by both parties who was firm and thorough throughout the trial, told the jurors from the start: \u201cYou, of course, will always bear in mind it\u2019s for the prosecution to prove its case \u2026 from beginning to end. And the defence does not need to prove anything.\u201d In his directions to jurors before they retired to deliberate, Kidd told them to keep in mind that Pell\u2019s defence team were at a significant forensic disadvantage because so much time had passed. \u201cThis is not an opportunity to make Cardinal Pell a scapegoat for the failures of the Catholic church,\u201d Kidd told them. \u201cYou may believe all, none or some of the witnesses\u2019 evidence. Don\u2019t look for hints from me. I\u2019m not going to give you any. I absolutely assure you of that. My role is not to express a view one way or another about the guilt or not of the accused man.\u201d In the end the jury\u2019s view was clear. After the verdict, and as shock spread throughout the room, Kidd thanked the jurors for their service. \u201cI for one strongly believe in the jury system, I think it\u2019s really important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly challenging, especially in an intense case like this.\u201d He agreed to allow Pell to undergo knee reconstruction surgery, but said the cardinal would be remanded in custody when he returned to court for sentencing on 27 February. Throughout the trial Pell was driven in a private car, with a police escort waiting each day to quickly whisk him inside and back out. His next police escort will be to prison.",

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales land and environment court has extended the injunction preventing demolition of Allianz stadium at Moore Park until 8 March when Justice Nicola Pain will bring down her ruling deciding its fate. The case, brought by community group Local Democracy Matters, is seeking to delay the stadium demolition and has argued that the government has failed to follow its own planning rules. The decision means hard demolition cannot occur before 8 March and could be delayed further depending on the final decision, which is likely to be delivered on the same day. Infrastructure NSW indicated during the hearing it wanted to start work on removing the roof of the stadium soon. The Berejiklian government had hoped to begin demolition of the Allianz stadium ahead of the state election on 23 March. It has already begun stripping out seats even though the design for the new $730m stadium is yet to get through the planning process. Labor has accused the government of trying to lock in the decision to knock down the stadium before the election. It has said that if it wins government it will make the Sydney Sports and Cricket Ground Trust borrow the funds rather than spend taxpayer\u2019s money and has suggested refurbishment might be a more appropriate option. The decision has been deeply unpopular with Sydneysiders who have criticised the spending as profligate when schools and hospitals are in need of upgrades. The stadium was opened in 1988 and is just 30 years old but the trust says it is not up to standard and requires a safety upgrade. Local Democracy Matters spokesman Chris Maltby welcomed the injunction especially as there had been discussion in recent days in the case about removing the stadium\u2019s roof. \u201cIts excellent that we have got this far,\u201d he said and welcomed Waverley Council\u2019s decision to join the legal challenge. \u201cThe main issue here is will the government uphold its own planning laws.\u201d Maltby said the outcome was not necessarily dependent on the outcome of the case. \u201cWe hope the decision will be revisited in the backwash of the election: $700 and something million to build a stadium of the same size on the same site is just a terrible waste of money,\u201d he said.",

In contrast, men who put in the same hours are no more likely to exhibit signs of the condition, researchers say. They suggest this could be because women face a \u201cdouble burden\u201d of very long hours spent in their job on top of domestic chores, which they tend to do much more of than male partners. Both men and women who work on most or all weekends are more likely to become depressed than those who only work during the week, the research also found. The results are based on data from more than 20,000 British adults taking part in Understanding Society: the UK household longitudinal study, which has been tracking family life and society since 2009. Women who work at least 55 hours a week had 7.3% more likelihood of symptoms of depression than those who worked between 35 and 40 hours. Women were also likelier than men to display signs of debilitating low moods linked to working on Saturday and Sunday, though both were affected (4.6% and 3.4% more likely). \u201cWomen in general are more likely to be depressed than men, and this was no different in the study,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Gill Weston, a PhD student at University College London. \u201cIndependent of their working patterns, we also found that workers with the most depressive symptoms were older, on lower incomes, smokers, in physically demanding jobs, and who were dissatisfied with work.\u201d Two-thirds of men work at weekends compared with half of women, according to the study, which has been published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.

TV, radio, posters, billboards and huge banners unfurled over public buildings urged the population to get out and vote.

It crystallises the status quo rather than making changes.\u201d</p> <p>In Cuba\u2019s last referendum on a constitution in 1976, during the Cold War, 98% of ballots voted \u201cyes\u201d.</p> <p>Voting on the island is optional though strongly encouraged by the state and nosy neighbours. Cuba does not allow international observers to monitor its elections but citizens are allowed to watch the vote count at local polling stations.</p> <p>The new constitution reaffirms the Communist Party as the only legitimate political party on the island, defines access to health and education as fundamental rights, and claims that humans can only \u201creach full dignity\u201d through \u201csocialism and communism\u201d.</p> <p>But there are also big changes. The new constitution introduces presidential term limits and enshrines the right to legal representation upon arrest.</p> <p>The document also gives constitutional backing to cautious pro-market reforms carried out since 2011. Private property is recognised, the rights of multinationals investing with the state are strengthened, and the market is recognised as a fact of life.</p> <p>Analysts estimate that one million Cubans now work in the private sector.</p> <p>Emily Morris, an economist from University College London, said the new constitution might open the path to stronger labour rights for those working in the island\u2019s non-state sector.</p> <p>\u201cWorker exploitation is already happening in the private sector,\u201d she said. \u201cBut recognising private enterprise could be a step forward by facilitating improved regulation of relationships between employers and employees.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cubans have overwhelmingly ratified a new constitution that reaffirms that socialism on the island is \u201cirrevocable\u201d while also legalising modest economic reforms instituted over the last decade. But in an unprecedented display of ballot-box dissent on the Communist-ruled island, more than 700,000 people voted \u201cno\u201d to the new founding document. 86.85% of those who voted answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question, \u201cDo you ratify the new constitution of the Republic\u201d. 9% of voters opposed ratification and 4.15% spoiled or left ballots blank. Turnout was 84.4% The state had campaigned hard prior to the vote, casting a \u201cyes\u201d vote as an act of patriotism and a vote for the Revolution. TV, radio, posters, billboards and huge banners unfurled over public buildings urged the population to get out and vote. Even the electric ticker boards on buses chugging along Havana\u2019s main thoroughfares read \u201cI Vote Yes\u201d (\u201cYo Voto S\u00ed\u201d). But the state was met with a surprisingly forceful challenge from an unofficial campaign against the new constitution. Evangelical churches concerned that the new constitution would create a pathway towards gay marriage hung banners reading \u201cmarriage: man + woman\u201d from church walls, while religious activists daubed posters on lamp posts \u2013 a direct challenge to the state\u2019s monopoly on public space. Although pastors did not explicitly call for a \u201cno\u201d vote, analysts say the church campaign mobilised non-religious, socially conservative sectors of the population to vote against the new constitution. And while state media gave no airtime or column inches to critical voices, #I\u2019mVotingNo (#YoVotoNo) hashtags were trending on Facebook. While older citizens said they voted to support the government, a younger generation of Cubans, particularly those living in the cities, are more daring. Cuban journalist M\u00f3nica Rivero, 29, said: \u201cI think the new constitution is too conservative. It crystallises the status quo rather than making changes.\u201d In Cuba\u2019s last referendum on a constitution in 1976, during the Cold War, 98% of ballots voted \u201cyes\u201d. Voting on the island is optional though strongly encouraged by the state and nosy neighbours. Cuba does not allow international observers to monitor its elections but citizens are allowed to watch the vote count at local polling stations. The new constitution reaffirms the Communist Party as the only legitimate political party on the island, defines access to health and education as fundamental rights, and claims that humans can only \u201creach full dignity\u201d through \u201csocialism and communism\u201d. But there are also big changes. The new constitution introduces presidential term limits and enshrines the right to legal representation upon arrest. The document also gives constitutional backing to cautious pro-market reforms carried out since 2011. Private property is recognised, the rights of multinationals investing with the state are strengthened, and the market is recognised as a fact of life. Analysts estimate that one million Cubans now work in the private sector. Emily Morris, an economist from University College London, said the new constitution might open the path to stronger labour rights for those working in the island\u2019s non-state sector. \u201cWorker exploitation is already happening in the private sector,\u201d she said. \u201cBut recognising private enterprise could be a step forward by facilitating improved regulation of relationships between employers and employees.\u201d",

She was asked by Channel 4 News if there would be no option to remain on a Labour-backed second referendum. She replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No, no, no, no. What I\u2019m saying is that we would have a referendum on whatever deal it is that may or may not pass through Parliament and we would be saying to people: \u2018Do you want this, or do you want to remain?\u2019</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked on which side she would be in that referendum, she said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s no secret I think that it\u2019s in Britain\u2019s interests for us to remain in the European Union. I\u2019ve always thought so and I continue to think so. And so, if there is a vote of that sort, I would certainly be campaigning for us to remain.</p> </blockquote> <p>She added: \u201cyeah, of course\u201d when asked if, in that case, she would be on the same side of the referendum campaign as her party leader, <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong>. And, asked to clarify if she was saying explicitly that Corbyn would campaign to remain in the European Union, Thornberry said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If it\u2019s a choice between a disastrous Tory Brexit or no deal and remaining, then that is what we will have to do.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c744e38e4b0cc09362e34d1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-25T20:23:04.117Z\">8.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Similar to the Lib Dems, the SNP is calling on Corbyn to explicitly confirm that remain would be an option in a Labour-backed second referendum.

Today the pressure mounted further, with deputy leader Tom Watson talking of setting up a social democratic grouping, and Momentum\u2019s chair, Jon Lansman, openly criticising the leadership over antisemitism. It seems to have finally jolted Corbyn into action. A deepening divide between shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Corbyn over a range of issues has been brewing, but failure to back the Kyle/Wilson plan would be the breaking point for many in Labour, with frontbenchers among those poised to resign. MPs have shown me an avalanche of emails from local party members resigning over Corbyn\u2019s Brexit feebleness.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/25/labour-brexit-jeremy-corbyn-public-vote-remain\">At last, Jeremy.

It almost seems as if Labour will only back a People\u2019s Vote when it is too late.</p> <p>For all that we know, Labour may not even back a referendum that includes the option to remain, despite it having up to a 10-point lead in the most recent polls. This is yet another attempt to cover up the cracks created by its internal divisions, but more prevarication won\u2019t do that.</p> <p>Labour has already given up valuable time for navel gazing when it should and could have been working constructively across party lines to deliver the solution that so many want to see.</p> <p>Again, this week, Labour will push for its failed renegotiation option.

And we will be calling for legislation to underpin this mandate.</p> <p>We will also be backing the Cooper-Letwin amendment to rule out a no deal outcome.

For me it is absolutely clear that there is no majority in the House of Commons to approve a deal.

Here is an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Davis] was, for a long time, Theresa May\u2019s \u2018favourite minister.

He believes he could \u2013 and perhaps should \u2013 lead the Conservative party. He lost out to David Cameron in 2005 following a leadership campaign that featured women in tight T-shirts captioned, \u2018It\u2019s DD for me.\u2019 Right now, he won\u2019t make any predictions about the leadership. Does he have the credentials? \u2018Yes. And if this were an application for a job as a chief executive, I would probably win it. But it isn\u2019t. And that isn\u2019t the way the decision is done.\u2019</p> </blockquote> <p>In news terms, the most interesting line in the extract is his admission that he is not certain that Theresa May will be able to survive another year as leader. Here is another extract from the interview, conducted by <strong>Charlotte Edwardes.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>By December, May stood on the brink of a no-confidence vote from her party after the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee received the requisite number of letters from MPs. Davis was widely tipped to take over. Did he put in a letter to the 1922 Committee? \u2018No.\u2019 He couldn\u2019t, he says, be that disloyal. Does she have another year? He sighs. \u2018I\u2019ve no idea.

But in a speech this evening its director general, Huw Evans, will go further than before, saying no deal would be \u201can unforgivable act of economic and social self-harm\u201d. According to an extract released in advance, he will tell the ABI annual dinner:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A no-deal outcome would be an unforgivable act of economic and social self-harm. It would mean leaving the world\u2019s single biggest trading block overnight with nothing but WTO rules to replace it.</p> <p>This would be wholly inadequate and unprecedented. None of the EU\u2019s 20 largest trading partners trade with the EU on solely WTO terms; they all have deeper agreements in place. And the WTO framework itself is designed to provide a mechanism for states to resolve trade disputes \u2013 it is not designed to be a safety net for the world\u2019s fifth largest economy leaving the world\u2019s biggest trading block. Nor do its rules guarantee market access for the services which make up four fifths of the UK economy. This matters because the EU is - by a very long distance - the largest export market for the UK insurance and long-term savings industry. </p> <p>As an industry we have done everything possible to prepare for no deal, including transferring an estimated 29m insurance contracts and the establishment of nearly 40 EU subsidiaries and branches to minimise disruption to customers. But we still believe very strongly that a conscious decision to opt for no deal would be an act of economic recklessness our great country would live to regret with WTO rules offering little to no protection against the consequences. As a last resort, if the only alternative to no deal is some form of short delay to Brexit, then delay we should.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c73d7f6e4b00307e95aa0d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-25T11:58:33.596Z\">11.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from Euronews\u2019 <strong>Darren McCaffrey</strong> on the meeting between Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, in Sharm El Sheikh this morning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DarrenEuronews/status/1100000281872470016\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NEW: May-Juncker meeting described as constructive and good progress was made. <br>Work should be finished before the March summit.<br>Tomorrow Barnier meets May\u2019s team in Brussels.</p>&mdash; Darren McCaffrey (@DarrenEuronews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarrenEuronews/status/1100000281872470016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 25, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"277e8388ebf110920994201516eb049505eea669\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/277e8388ebf110920994201516eb049505eea669/0_178_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May holding a bilateral meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker (seated) in Sharm El Sheikh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May holding a bilateral meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker (seated) in Sharm El Sheikh</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c73d674e4b00307e95aa0ce\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-25T11:53:49.678Z\">11.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Senior Scottish Liberal Democrats are open to a future merger with the Independent Group (TIG) of MPs, providing it establishes its liberal credentials and holds together as a cohesive force, senior sources have said.</p> <p>Another key issue for senior Lib Dems in Scotland is replacing Vince Cable as UK party leader: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/07/vince-cable-step-down-lib-dem-leader-brexit-resolved-stopped\">Cable has already indicated he will step down after May\u2019s local elections and EU withdrawal,</a> but dissatisfaction at what his seen as his lacklustre leadership is growing.</p> <p>Deeply frustrated that under Cable the party has failed to exploit Labour and Tory divisions over Brexit, and their right- and left-wards drift, some want a leadership contest quickly. Jo Swinson, the MP for East Dunbartonshire, is touted as a leading contender to replace him, as is Ed Davey, the former energy secretary.</p> <p>Speculation about which Scottish politicians, particularly at Holyrood, might defect to TIG has intensified. It is not thought either Kezia Dugdale, the former Scottish Labour leader, nor Ian Murray, the Labour MP for Edinburgh South, are minded to jump first.</p> <p>After originally being in coalition government with Labour during the first two Scottish parliaments, from 1999 to 2007, the Lib Dems are now Holyrood\u2019s smallest party, behind the Greens, with five MSPs.</p> <p>The party suffered badly from the voter backlash at Nick Clegg\u2019s coalition with David Cameron at Westminster, losing all but one of its Commons seats, but recovered in the 2017 snap general election to take four Westminster seats.</p> <p>A pact between TIG and the Lib Dems at Westminster is seen as a logical first step. Some Scottish Lib Dem MSPs, who met for their spring conference in Hamilton last Friday, think their party is the most obvious suitor for TIG at Holyrood, and should merge en masse later this year.</p> <p>Others are cautious, citing nervousness about the unknowns \u2013 few Lib Dems activists know the MPs who make up TIG - but nevertheless excitement at the arrival of a new centrist party. One suggested some Lib Dems might baulk at working with the Sheffield MP Angela Smith, given Labour\u2019s bruising campaigns against them in the city.</p> <p>A source said the key questions were about funding; personalities; a coherent policy platform and seeing how Brexit unfolded. Even so, the bias is towards an eventual merger. \u201cThere is huge potential but we have an awful lot to find out first,\u201d he said. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c73d4fee4b0ac8d72de7d6c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-25T11:48:54.311Z\">11.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Office for National Statistics has released figures this morning on <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsofhomelesspeopleinenglandandwales/localauthorityestimates2013to2017\">the number of deaths of homeless people in England and Wales by local authority area. </a>As you would expect, it says that areas with the highest deprivation have many more deaths relative to their population (nine times as many, to be precise) as the least disadvantaged areas.</p> <p>Here are the five areas with the highest numbers of deaths of homeless people, per head of population, in the five years covered by the data.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6122f2e14ca66b6687bb456d23d72896a65f37b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6122f2e14ca66b6687bb456d23d72896a65f37b/0_0_795_552/500.png\" alt=\"Areas with highest numbers of deaths of homeless people\" width=\"500\" height=\"347\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Areas with highest numbers of deaths of homeless people</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c73d3e9e4b0cc09362e3006\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-25T11:40:17.688Z\">11.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d30dda302cb47faad6dab65a9a8a1de1a05d1229\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d30dda302cb47faad6dab65a9a8a1de1a05d1229/0_193_3427_2057/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May meeting Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, at the EU-Arab summit at Sharm El Sheikh this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May meeting Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, at the EU-Arab summit at Sharm El Sheikh this morning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c73d35fe4b00307e95aa0bd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-25T11:38:14.808Z\">11.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Brexit should be delayed, my colleague <strong>Simon Jenkins</strong> writes in an article for Guardian Opinion. \u201cToday\u2019s parliament well mirrors the nation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is implacably split.

Lansman, who is Jewish, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I do think we have a major problem and it always seems to me that we underestimate the scale of it. I think it is a widespread problem. I think it is now obvious that we have a much larger number of people with hardcore antisemitic opinions which unfortunately is polluting the atmosphere in a lot of constituency parties and in particular online. We have to deal with these people.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lansman said the extent of the problem in the party was partly a reflection of its size - 300,000 new members joined after Corbyn became leader - and partly a reflection of its age profile. He explained: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are conspiracy theorists in many parts of the political spectrum, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s exclusive to the Labour party.</p> <p>The Tory party is a smaller party and an elderly party and the role of social media in fomenting and spreading some of the poison is therefore more of a problem in the Labour party.</p> </blockquote> <p>But he said he did not accept the claim from Luciana Berger, who left Labour to join the Independent Group last week largely because of the antisemitic abuse she has received, that Labour was \u201cinstitutionally antisemitic\u201d.</p> <p>And Lansman also said he did not agree with the suggestion from Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/24/tom-watson-corbyn-needs-to-understand-labour-must-change-antisemitism-crisis\">Corbyn should personally review some antisemitism complaints himself.</a> Lansman said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Jeremy Corbyn has been an anti-racist campaigner all his life, I have known him for decades and I do absolutely believe in his commitment to eradicate that.</p> <p>I think he is overseeing the party\u2019s battle against antisemitism.

There has been speculation that they could choose a leader. <strong>Chuka Umunna</strong>, the former Labour MP, said yesterday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/24/chuka-umunna-urges-voters-to-back-independent-group\">he wanted to play \u201cthe biggest role\u201d in the group</a>, so by the end of the day he could be a leader - although not a party leader, because TIG are not a party yet.</p> <p><strong>Jo Swinson</strong>, the Lib Dem deputy leader, told the today programme that her party (which, coincidentally, also has 11 MPs) wanted to work with the new group. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think we need to be working together with the Independent Group MPs but we need to find a 2019 way of doing that and I\u2019m open-minded about how that looks. I want to approach this with a very very open mind, potentially to have radical change. It is not very often we get a moment to break up the broken political system and we have that moment now.</p> </blockquote> <p>She also suggested the the Lib Dems could agree a pact with the new group that would see them not standing candidates against each other. When asked if this was an option, she replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t think we should be taking any of these things off the table ...</p> <p>I will welcome anyone to the Liberal Democrats who shares my liberal values, and obviously I want more people to join the Lib Dems. </p> <p>But I am not going to be petty about this and suggest that I am not going to work with somebody who shares many of my values just because for whatever reason they don\u2019t feel that they can join my party.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6479f3ecaa8b7e4fd0c2691027fe0929dc2257bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6479f3ecaa8b7e4fd0c2691027fe0929dc2257bb/1554_91_2792_1675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jo Swinson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jo Swinson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c73a81ee4b0cc09362e2eaa\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-25T09:12:41.170Z\">9.12am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Theresa May increasingly likely to accept article 50 extension, minister suggests</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May is under growing pressure to agree to extend article 50. Perhaps the clearest evidence that she is coming close to embracing the idea came from May herself yesterday, when she told reporters on her plane as she flew out to the EU-Arab summit in Sharm El Sheikh that \u201cit\u2019s still within our grasp to leave the EU by the 29 March.\u201d She used to assert as fact, without qualification, that Britain would be out at the end of March. Now it is just \u201cwithin our grasp\u201d - a phrase more typically applied to political aspirations that have little chance of being realised, like ending child poverty.</p> <p>But this morning there are three more developments suggesting that May is getting ever closer to embracing the need to extend article 50.</p> <p><strong>1) <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/02/24/exclusive-brexit-will-delayed-two-months-plans-considered-theresa/\">The Daily Telegraph (paywall) reports that Number 10 has drawn up contingency plans to extend article 50 for two months. </a></strong>In a story that is not being denied by government sources, who point out that you would expect the government to have contingency plans for all eventualities,<strong> Steven Swinford </strong>and <strong>Anna Mikhailova</strong> report:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Brexit will be delayed for up to two months <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/02/24/theresa-may-delays-brexit-vote-fortnight-refuses-censure-ministers/\">under plans being considered by Theresa May to extend Article 50</a>, the Telegraph has learned.</p> <p>Downing Street officials have drawn up a series of options in a bid to avoid resignations by ministers determined to support a backbench bid to take no deal off the table this week ...</p> <p>While the Downing Street plans do not specify the length of the extension, ministers believe it will be no longer than two months - avoiding the need for the UK to participate in European parliament elections.</p> <p>On Wednesday the Commons will vote on a backbench bill tabled by Yvette Cooper, a senior Labour MP, that would force Mrs May to request an extension of Article 50 if a deal has not been reached by March 13.</p> <p>The prime minister could avert a rebellion by Tory MPs and a Commons defeat by committing to requesting a Brexit delay herself, although in doing so risks alienating Eurosceptic Tory MPs. \u201cIt\u2019s very finely balanced,\u201d a source said.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1099789548597452801\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">TELEGRAPH: May draws up plans to delay Brexit by 2 months <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomorrowspaperstoday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tomorrowspaperstoday</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/DUN7vjh4Co\">pic.twitter.com/DUN7vjh4Co</a></p>&mdash; Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1099789548597452801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 24, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>2) The Conservative MP Simon Hart, with the support of members of the Brexit Delivery Group (Tories who want to deliver Brexit, while avoiding no deal), has drawn up an amendment for the Brexit vote on Wednesday that would allow MPs to vote for a plan to avoid no deal without having to pass a new law, as the Yvette Cooper amendment proposes.</strong> This would be more acceptable to Number 10 than Cooper, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56d4dbde-385b-11e9-b856-5404d3811663\">the FT reports (paywall):</a><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Under the proposal, which is set to be tabled as an amendment on Wednesday, the government would be legally obliged to offer MPs the option of requesting an extension in the article 50 exit process beyond March 29. EU leaders have said they are likely to agree to some form of extension, but Mrs May has said she will not ask for one. </p> <p>A counterproposal, led by Conservative MPs Simon Hart and Andrew Percy, would delay Brexit day to May 23, the start of the European parliament elections, if parliament in Westminster has not approved a deal by March 12. </p> <p>In an email to 50 members of the Brexit Delivery Group of moderate Tory MPs, Mr Hart said the amendment \u201ccould offer some colleagues who have indicated they might support Letwin-Cooper a way out, whilst also removing the danger of a crashing out at the end of March without a deal\u201d. </p> <p>The plan seeks to avoid \u201cthe constitutional upheaval\u201d of the Cooper amendment, and therefore win Downing Street\u2019s support. But as a result, it does not set out legislative moves to tie the government\u2019s hands. \u201cIt is just an expression of opinion,\u201d said Sir Oliver. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3) Tobias Ellwood, a defence minister and one of those Tories in government who has hinted that he would vote for Cooper to avoid the risk of a no-deal Brexit, told the Today programme this morning that he thought May might announce an article 50 extension herself.</strong> May was \u201clistening\u201d to the concerns of MPs about no deal, he said. Asked if she could announce an article 50 extension after her return from talks with other EU leaders in Egypt, he replied: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You need to wait and hear what she has to say when she gets back. </p> <p>That, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m encouraging that to happen because it\u2019s not in anybody\u2019s interest to see no deal.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also said that May should be willing to defy Tory Brexiters in the European Research Group on this point. (The ERG think it would be a mistake to rule out a no-deal Brexit.) Ellwood said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[May] has done her utmost to appease the ERG. The referendum itself was done with them in mind, the article 50 letter was sent with them in mind, the motions have been delayed and written with the ERG in mind. </p> <p>It\u2019s now important for them to fall in line. We would not be having this conversation about no deal if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that, I\u2019m afraid, there\u2019s been a bloc voice in our party that has hindered the prime minister getting this across the line. </p> <p>She may get the necessary concessions and legal agreements concerning the backstop, but, ultimately, the clock is ticking down. If we cannot get this deal across the line, we are facing the prospect of having to extend.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ellwood\u2019s interview gave some journalists the impression that he knew more about what might happen than he was actually letting on.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a summary of the evening\u2019s events: Labour announced the party would back a second referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the EU if the prime minister declined to adopt its Brexit stance. The party said it would table an amendment on Tuesday that, if passed, would require Theresa May to adhere to its five tests. It also said it would back moves to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Should that be rejected by MPs, as is expected, Labour said it would back a second referendum. The party said it would \u201cput forward or support an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit\u201d. Amid some confusion over what would be on offer in that referendum, the Labour frontbencher Emily Thornberry said voters would be given the option of remaining in the EU or rubberstamping May\u2019s deal. Thornberry said both she and Jeremy Corbyn would be campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU under those circumstances. You can read a summary of the day\u2019s earlier events here. We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now, so thanks for reading and for the comments. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleague Jessica Elgot has the full story: Here\u2019s a little more on those comments from the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry. She was asked by Channel 4 News if there would be no option to remain on a Labour-backed second referendum. She replied: No, no, no, no. What I\u2019m saying is that we would have a referendum on whatever deal it is that may or may not pass through Parliament and we would be saying to people: \u2018Do you want this, or do you want to remain?\u2019 Asked on which side she would be in that referendum, she said: It\u2019s no secret I think that it\u2019s in Britain\u2019s interests for us to remain in the European Union. I\u2019ve always thought so and I continue to think so. And so, if there is a vote of that sort, I would certainly be campaigning for us to remain. She added: \u201cyeah, of course\u201d when asked if, in that case, she would be on the same side of the referendum campaign as her party leader, Jeremy Corbyn. And, asked to clarify if she was saying explicitly that Corbyn would campaign to remain in the European Union, Thornberry said: If it\u2019s a choice between a disastrous Tory Brexit or no deal and remaining, then that is what we will have to do. Similar to the Lib Dems, the SNP is calling on Corbyn to explicitly confirm that remain would be an option in a Labour-backed second referendum. Its Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said: Scotland did not vote for Brexit and we must not be dragged out of the EU against our will. Remaining is by far the best deal of all \u2013 and it is the only way to protect jobs and living standards. The Labour frontbencher, Emily Thornberry, has said remain should be an option on a second referendum and, more than that, Labour would campaign for it. The Conservative party chairman, Brandon Lewis, has said Corbyn\u2019s position makes it clear the Labour leader wants to \u201cbetray the will of the British people and ignore the biggest democratic vote in our nation\u2019s history\u201d. Corbyn\u2019s Labour have ripped up their promise to respect the referendum result and are now pursuing a divisive second referendum that would take us back to square one. Once again it\u2019s clear: Jeremy Corbyn is using Brexit to play his own political games. Instead of working to thwart Brexit at this critical stage, Jeremy Corbyn should put the country\u2019s interest before his party\u2019s \u2013 by backing a deal that respects and delivers on the result of the referendum. The Guardian columnist, Polly Toynbee, is welcoming of Corbyn\u2019s announcement this evening \u2013 but urges him now to go the whole hog. The defection of eight Labour MPs seems to have had a big effect, breaking the obstinacy of the leadership team. Today the pressure mounted further, with deputy leader Tom Watson talking of setting up a social democratic grouping, and Momentum\u2019s chair, Jon Lansman, openly criticising the leadership over antisemitism. It seems to have finally jolted Corbyn into action. A deepening divide between shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Corbyn over a range of issues has been brewing, but failure to back the Kyle/Wilson plan would be the breaking point for many in Labour, with frontbenchers among those poised to resign. MPs have shown me an avalanche of emails from local party members resigning over Corbyn\u2019s Brexit feebleness. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Brexit spokesman, Hywel Williams, has accused Jeremy Corbyn of having to be \u201cdragged kicking and screaming\u201d towards a second referendum with remain as an option. But still, the Labour frontbench can\u2019t bring itself to do so without pointless, time-wasting conditions. It almost seems as if Labour will only back a People\u2019s Vote when it is too late. For all that we know, Labour may not even back a referendum that includes the option to remain, despite it having up to a 10-point lead in the most recent polls. This is yet another attempt to cover up the cracks created by its internal divisions, but more prevarication won\u2019t do that. Labour has already given up valuable time for navel gazing when it should and could have been working constructively across party lines to deliver the solution that so many want to see. Again, this week, Labour will push for its failed renegotiation option. Its intransigence is exasperating. We can only hope then, that its promise of backing a \u2018public vote\u2019 \u2013 that includes the option to remain \u2013 will be a real one come the meaningful vote next month. While Williams is not the only person to express reservations about what options would be on a Corbyn-backed referendum, it is worth reading his comments in the context of the previous post \u2013 as well as this one. The chairman of the Leave Means Leave campaign group, John Longworth, described the Labour move as a \u201ccowardly decision from a man who should never be trusted with the premiership of this country\u201d. He said: Jeremy Corbyn claims he\u2019s upholding \u2018conference policy\u2019 by supporting a public vote \u2013 Mr Corbyn, your Labour MPs were not voted for upon this basis. Your Labour voters did not vote for you upon this basis. Almost 40% of them voted to leave the EU in 2016 and back in 2017 you made a pledge in your manifesto to honour this result. As we noted earlier, Corbyn\u2019s announcement today is consistent with Labour\u2019s conference motion from last September. And it is for precisely that reason that Luciana Berger, one of the MPs who resigned from Labour last week, is unimpressed by it: Another of them, Angela Smith, was somewhat more upbeat, saying she would be delighted if Labour backed a second referendum with remain as an option and telling Sky News Corbyn\u2019s move \u201clooks like a very positive development\u201d. Corbyn is addressing the meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party, where similar concerns are being raised: There has been some discussion about whether or not Labour\u2019s second referendum, should it come to pass, would include remain as an option. It\u2019s worth noting at this point that the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has consistently backed such a move \u2013 including as recently as last month, when he told a Fabian Society event: I don\u2019t think it is any secret I firmly believe there should be a remain option \u2013 and there has to be a genuine leave option. The Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, has said he will work with Labour on the plan \u2013 but made clear any referendum must include that remain option. We have long argued it is the right and logical thing to do for the people to have the final say on Brexit. We welcome any MPs who share this crucial aim. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, also welcomed Corbyn\u2019s move, saying: It is the right decision for London \u2013 and for the whole country \u2013 to give the public their say for the first time on a final Brexit deal. I hope members of parliament will support this move, which is vital to protect jobs and growth. The prime minister must now withdraw article 50 to prevent Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal within weeks and to give us time to sort out her mess. Corbyn said Labour\u2019s action is consistent with a motion the party backed at its party conference in September last year. This seems to be correct. Here\u2019s the relevant section of the composite motion: Should parliament vote down a Tory Brexit deal or the talks end in no deal, conference believes this would constitute a loss of confidence in the government. In these circumstances, the best outcome for the country is an immediate general election that can sweep the Tories from power. If we cannot get a general election, Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote. If the government is confident in negotiating a deal that working people, our economy and communities will benefit from they should not be afraid to put that deal to the public. Labour has said this evening that the second referendum portion of its move is aimed at preventing Theresa May from forcing through either her deal as it stands or no deal \u2013 not necessarily at stopping Brexit in any form. If the prime minister were to adopt a Brexit stance Labour felt it could back, there would be no push for a second referendum. The shadow Brexit secretary put it like this: The prominent remain-supporting Labour MP, David Lammy, has welcomed the move. Lammy, who campaigns for a second referendum with the People\u2019s Vote group, said: Even if MPs can agree some sort of deal, it would be wrong to force it on the British people when we now know so many of the promises made in 2016 have been broken and any deal will be worse than the one we\u2019ve already got inside the EU. These are dangerous times for the Labour party and our country. Jeremy Corbyn is today taking the first step to reunite our party by showing he is listening to our voters and members on this, the biggest issue of our time. But it is also crucial when food prices are already rising and car manufacturers are scrapping investment that we provide the clarity needed to plan for the future. Here\u2019s the full text of the amendment Corbyn intends to table on Tuesday: That this house instructs ministers (a) to negotiate with the EU for changes to the political declaration to secure: i. A permanent and comprehensive customs union with the EU; ii. Close alignment with the single market underpinned by shared institutions and obligations; iii. Dynamic alignment on rights and protections; iv. Commitments on participation in EU agencies and funding programmes, including in areas such as the environment, education, and industrial regulation; and v. Unambiguous agreement on the detail of future security arrangements, including access to the European Arrest Warrant and vital shared databases; (b) To introduce primary legislation to give statutory effect to this negotiating mandate Corbyn says Labour\u2019s move will be two-pronged. He will first seek to force Theresa May to adopt his party\u2019s approach to Brexit by tabling an amendment to the government\u2019s motion. His five demands are, in his words: A permanent and comprehensive customs union with the EU. Close alignment with the single market underpinned by shared institutions and obligations. Dynamic alignment on rights and protections. Commitments on participation in EU agencies and funding programmes, including in areas such as the environment, education, and industrial regulation. Unambiguous agreements on the detail of future security arrangements, including access to the European Arrest Warrant and vital shared databases. And he also plans to announce his support for an amendment taking no deal off the table to the parliamentary Labour Party this evening, as well as saying Labour will \u201cput forward or support an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit\u201d. He\u2019ll tell Labour MPs: The prime minister is recklessly running down the clock, in an attempt to force MPs to choose between her botched deal and a disastrous no deal. We cannot and will not accept. Last week, after our visit to talk to EU officials and leaders in Brussels and Madrid, no one can be in any doubt Labour\u2019s alternative Brexit plan is serious and credible. We are convinced our alternative, which puts jobs and living standards first, could command support in the House of Commons, bring people who voted leave and remain together, and be negotiated with the EU. That\u2019s why we will be putting down an amendment in parliament this week setting out Labour\u2019s plan: For a comprehensive customs union with a UK say; close alignment with the single market; guarantees on rights and standards; protection for Britain\u2019s role in EU agencies; and a security agreement which guarantees access to the European arrest warrant and vital shared databases. And we will be calling for legislation to underpin this mandate. We will also be backing the Cooper-Letwin amendment to rule out a no deal outcome. One way or another, we will do everything in our power to prevent no deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May\u2019s overwhelmingly rejected deal. That\u2019s why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, says the party will seek a second referendum to prevent what he calls a \u201cdamaging Tory Brexit\u201d. Hello, Kevin Rawlinson here, taking over from Andrew Sparrow because... Theresa May will not get her Brexit deal through the Commons, Donald Tusk has warned, leaving the UK with the option of \u201ca chaotic Brexit\u201d or an extension of its membership of the EU beyond 29 March. As Daniel Boffey and Rajeev Syal report, the European council president, to quell \u201cspeculation\u201d, disclosed that, during private talks with the prime minister at a summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, he had walked through the legal process that would need to be followed to delay Brexit. Tusk said it was not the EU\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d to extend the two-year negotiation but that it was now evident to him that it was the \u201crational solution\u201d in light of the prime minister\u2019s failure to corral a majority behind the deal. Downing Street has said it will publish previously unseen cabinet papers setting out the dangers of a no-deal Brexit. (See 4.11am.) Chris Grayling has been accused of trying to conduct large parts of a trial over the \u00a314m Brexit ferry fiasco in private, against the principle of open justice, the high court has heard. Britain\u2019s insurers are to warn that a no-deal Brexit would be an \u201cunforgivable act of economic and social self-harm\u201d, arguing that a delay to the process would be preferable to leaving the EU without an agreement. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, has refused to tell MPs if he contacted the Bangladeshi government before deciding to remove British citizenship from Shamima Begum. During Home Office questions, he defended his decision and said it would not leave the 19-year-old - who joined Islamic State in Syria in 2015 - stateless despite Bangladesh saying there is \u201cno question\u201d of her being allowed into the country. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has told MPs in an oral statement a that after Brexit the UK will seek to maintain 43 existing EU trade remedy measures, but drop the remaining 66. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has told MPs he will take personal charge of monitoring and logging abuse and threats made by members, effectively creating a parallel disciplinary process. Labour has a much larger number of members who hold \u201chardcore antisemitic opinions\u201d than previously thought, Momentum\u2019s founder has said. The UK is to ban membership of or support for Hezbollah\u2019s political wing, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, has announced, as he accused the Lebanese Islamist movement of destabilising the Middle East. The Conservative MP Dan Poulter has won substantial libel damages from the Sunday Times after it published claims that he had sexually assaulted three female MPs. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Sarah Newton, the minister for disabled people, has apologised after it emerged an extra 30,000 ill and disabled benefit claimants could have been underpaid. As the Press Association reports, Newon told the Commons the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) now believes 210,000 people could be due arrears payments as a result of failings linked to the transfer of people from older incapacity benefits to Employment and Support Allowance (Esa), an increase from the previous estimate of 180,000. She said she \u201cwished this had never happened\u201d but officials are \u201cworking at pace\u201d to ensure people receive the cash they are entitled to. This is from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. The government is being urged to end \u201cfailed\u201d privatised probation contracts and bring them back into public ownership, the Press Association reports. Three trade unions have written to the justice secretary, David Gauke, urging him to \u201cabandon\u201d the contracts when they run out next year. Unison, the GMB and Napo highlighted the recent collapse of Working Links, which had three contracts, saying the government should have stepped in when it was clear the company was in trouble. This is from Stefan Rousseau, the Press Association\u2019s chief political photographer. Readers sometimes ask how much Brexit has already cost the UK. The People\u2019s Vote campaign has partially answered that, with research published today saying the costs include a \u00a340bn+ annual hit to the economy, at least \u00a314bn a year in lost tax revenues, and an extra \u00a3404 a year cost to the average household, caused by the impact of inflation on bills. Gavin Shuker, the former Labour MP, will be the convener of the new Independent Group of MPs, but not its leader, ITV\u2019s Carl Dinnen reports. The government may promise its assessment of the impact of a no-deal Brexit promised to Anna Soubry (see 11.07am) as early as tomorrow, HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh reports. Anne Marie Morris, a Tory Brexiter, told the World at One that she thought Theresa May would end up proposing a Brexit involving the UK staying in a customs union with the EU. Morris said she would be \u201chorrified\u201d if this happened. She explained: In my view, the prime minister is frankly listening to herself and her close advisers. Theresa is her own woman - we\u2019ve all seen that - and she is determined to deliver what she wants. I\u2019ll be brutally honest, what I believe she wants is a customs union. My real fear is that what she will do is when she continues to fail - which she almost inevitably was going to, because Europe will not deliver - to get a deal with Europe, she will come back and say \u2018The only thing left, chaps, is a customs union\u2019. I would be horrified and I do not want that left to the last minute. The 11 MPs who belong to the Independent Group held their first private meeting as a group at Westminster this afternoon. We have not had a read-out yet from what they discussed, although it is understood that they were not planning to elect a leader. On the World at One Michael Heseltine, the former deputy prime minister and one of the most prominent pro-Europeans in the Conservative party, said that cabinet ministers like Amber Rudd should be willing to resign to prevent a no-deal Brexit. That is what he would do, he said. He went on: I believe it is in the national interest that they should. Every indication of this battle - which is so serious and so prolonged - is that the right wing will not compromise and the only way to bring a measure of balance to it is to play the same ruthless game that they are playing. You have to ask yourself why you are in politics. What\u2019s it for? What do you believe in? What sort of person are you? Overwhelmingly for me, the answer has to be \u2018I have views about this country, I have a philosophy and approach, I believe in certain principles and they - whilst usefully combined often with the Conservative party - are supreme and on this issue I cannot go along with the tactics and techniques being used to try to blackmail us into a bad deal for Britain\u2019. Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, has written to all the party\u2019s MPs and peers to say that from now on he will be \u201clogging and monitoring\u201d all complaints of anti-Semitic abuse and bullying, the Press Association reports. In an email, Watson asked Labour parliamentarians to inform him of any complaints of antisemitism so he can ensure that they are shared with Jeremy Corbyn and other leading figures. He said that any concerns about antisemitism should be raised with the party\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby. But he added: As your deputy leader, I am deeply alarmed at the amount of abuse that colleagues are receiving from within the party. In order to properly assess and monitor the scale of the problem, I would like to see any issue or complaint you raise with the general secretary. From now on, my team will be logging and monitoring all complaints. I will ensure that this information is shared with both Jeremy, the shadow cabinet and colleagues on the national executive committee. Last week was originally supposed to be a Commons recess, but the government cancelled the half-term parliamentary break, seemingly because Downing Street concluded that the public would take a dim view of MPs being away while the Brexit crisis was unresolved. During the week no significant debates took place. But the cancelled recess still cost the taxpayer up to \u00a3400,000, CityAM\u2019s Owen Bennett reports. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, is taking questions in the Commons. Earlier today he announced that he was banning Hezbollah. Here is my colleague Patrick Wintour\u2019s story with the full details. According to ITV\u2019s Robert Peston, ministers minded to vote for the Yvette Cooper amendment are not impressed by reports that Theresa May will try to buy them off with the promise of a vote for a two-month article 50 extension. (See 2.31pm.) My initial assessment was that this probably would be enough to hobble Cooper, but I may be wrong. A lot will depend on what May actually says (and how she handles questions like, \u2018And what will happen if there is still no deal by the end of May?\u2019) We will find out more when May makes a statement in the Commons on Brexit tomorrow. According to Joe Murphy and Nicholas Cecil in the latest Evening Standard splash, Theresa May will promise MPs that they will get the chance to vote for an article 50 extension if the Commons does not pass a Brexit deal by 12 March. They report: The prime minister is set to bow to cabinet rebels by promising a new Commons vote on delaying Brexit. Downing Street is privately offering to make time for a vote in a fortnight allowing for a two-month delay beyond March 29 in return for them calling off a rebellion on Wednesday. A postponement of Britain\u2019s withdrawal would be a humiliating climbdown for Theresa May, whose spokesman continued to insist this morning that it was \u201cnot something she wants to do\u201d. But a top cabinet minister warned that it was not \u201cacceptable\u201d to risk crashing out. This effectively amounts to Downing Street accepting the Simon Hart amendment. (See 9.12am.) Why would Number 10 agree to this, when May clearly believes that extending article 50 on its own would not solve her Brexit dilemma? (See 1.57pm.) Well, because if she did not, there would be a very strong chance of MPs passing the Yvette Cooper amendment on Wednesday. And if government ministers voted for it, as many have suggested they would, May would either have to sack them en masse, or accept that she had lost control of her government. If the Standard is right (and it normally is), and May does make this offer, the majority for the Cooper amendment would probably evaporate. In fact, since Cooper would have achieved much of what she wanted, the amendment could even end up getting pulled. Tory Brexiters are unhappy about any talk of extending article 50. But they are much more alarmed by Cooper than by Hart, because Cooper would enable MPs to pass legislation blocking a no-deal Brexit that could become a Trojan horse for a lengthy article 50 extension, or conceivably (because the bill could be amended) another referendum. Here are the main points from Theresa May\u2019s press conference. May said that MPs could be asked to approve a revised Brexit deal before it has been agreed with the EU. Asked if EU leaders would have to agree changes to the withdrawal deal first, or if the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d could come first, she replied: On the procedural point, it is possible to do it either way. This is significant because it allows her to sidestep what would otherwise be a procedural quandary: MPs will only vote for the deal if there are changes, but the EU will only agree changes if it knows that they will be enough to secure a majority in the Commons. May\u2019s answer makes the scenario being floated earlier by Tom McTague (see 11.24am) sound ever more plausible. She refused to say whether or not she would sack ministers who vote for the Cooper amendment on Wednesday. (See 1.17pm.) It is thought that a dozen or more ministers, including some in cabinet, could defy the whip and vote for the amendment, which is designed to allow MPs to legislate to block a no-deal Brexit. Asked if she would force ministers to resign if they wanted to vote for the amendment, May refused to engage with the question, saying that at this point it is not even clear what amendments will be called. (Anyone who seriously thinks the Cooper amendment won\u2019t get has a poor understanding of John Bercow, the speaker.) May also refused to answer a question about whether the passing of the Cooper amendment could increase the chances of her deal being approved by 12 March. (See 1.15pm.) She refused to say whether, in the event of MPs not passing her deal, she would opt for no deal, or an extension of article 50. May said she had encountered \u201ca real determination\u201d amongst EU leaders to achieve a deal. In her opening remarks she said: Of course, I\u2019ve also had the opportunity to discuss Brexit while I\u2019ve been here. I held good meetings with President Tusk, Prime Minister Conte, Chancellor Merkel, Prime Minister Rutte, President Juncker and the taoiseach. There is still more work to do, and my team will be in Brussels tomorrow working on the legally binding assurances that the UK Parliament needs in relation to the backstop. But what I have sensed in all of my conversations with my fellow leaders both here in Sharm El Sheikh and in recent days is a real determination to find a way through which allows the UK to leave the EU in a smooth and orderly way with a deal. She restated her opposition to delaying article 50, saying \u201ca delay in this process does not deliver a decision in parliament\u201d. She said: An extension to article 50, a delay in this process, doesn\u2019t deliver a decision in parliament, it doesn\u2019t deliver a deal. All it does is precisely what the word \u2018delay\u2019 says. Any extension of article 50 isn\u2019t addressing the issues. She restated her belief that achieving Brexit by 29 March was \u201cwithin our grasp\u201d. As stated earlier (see 9.12am), this implicitly accepts a much higher degree of uncertainty about Brexit happening on time than May has previously acknowledged. She refused to say when the UK would allow direct flights to Sharm El Sheikh to continue. May\u2019s press conference is over. \u201cHighlights\u201d is not exactly the word, but I will post a summary of the main things she said in a moment. Q: If ministers want to vote for the Cooper amendment, will they have to resign? May says she has not tabled the motion yet. MPs do not know what it will say, and they do not know what amendments will be called. When the meaningful vote takes place, MPs will have to decide if they want Brexit to happen \u201cin a smooth and orderly way\u201d. May refuses to say ministers will be sacked if they vote for the Cooper amendment. Q: Would it not be helfpul for you to have the Cooper amendment in place, so that MPs are incentivised to vote for your deal on 12 March, before MPs vote (under the Cooper plan) to extend article 50. May says the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d she has promised could come before 12 March. It does not have to be on that date, she says. She says she hopes MPs will vote for a deal. May says she is working to deliver what parliament asked her to - to address the concerns about the backstop. She says her team will be back in Brussels tomorrow. She says it is within her grasp to get a deal by 29 March. (I think you can guess where this is going ...) Q: [From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston] None of your ministers think you can get a deal through by 29 March. Why are you so resistant to delaying article 50? May says a delay does not deliver a deal. All it does is what the word \u201cdelay\u201d says. She says she thinks it is \u201cwithin our grasp\u201d to get a deal by 29 March. She repeats the phrase. That is where all her energies are focused. On Brexit, she says she has had good meetings with EU leaders here. She says the British team will hold further talks in Brussels tomorrow. She says she has found a real determination to ensure that UK can leave the EU with a deal. Theresa May is speaking now. She starts by talking about the non-Brexit discussions she has had at the summit. Theresa May is due to give her own press conference in Sharm El Sheikh in the next few minutes. This is what Donald Tusk said in full when he was asked about the possibility of article 50 being extended. He said: In order to put an end to speculation, I can say first of all that Prime Minister May and I discussed yesterday a lot of issues, including the legal and procedural context of a potential extension. For me it is absolutely clear that there is no majority in the House of Commons to approve a deal. We will face an alternative: a chaotic Brexit, or extension. The less time there is until the 29 March, the greater is the likelihood of an extension. And this is an objective fact; not our intention, not our plan, but an objective fact. I believe that in the situation we are in an extension would be a rational solution. But Prime Minister May still believes that she is able to avoid this scenario. And I can assure you, and I did it also yesterday during my meeting with Prime Minister May, that no matter in which scenario it will be, all the [EU] 27 will show maximum understanding and goodwill. I have listened to the tape several times, and it is clear to me that Tusk said: \u201cFor me it is absolutely clear that there is no majority in the House of Commons to approve a deal.\u201d But it also sounded as if he intended to say: \u201cFor me it is absolutely clear that if there is no majority in the House of Commons to approve a deal, we will face an alternative\u201d etc etc. Tusk confirms he has discussed extending article 50 with May. He says EU would favour an article 50 extension as a \u201crational solution\u201d if a Brexit deal is not passed soon. Tusk\u2019s comments are little more than a statement of the obvious. But until now he and the European commission have been reluctant to discuss the possibility of article 50 being extended in public, and so the fact that he has decided to endorse the idea in public is significant. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, is speaking at the press conference now. Asked about the possibility of an article 50 extension, he says at the moment there is no majority in the Commons for a deal. If there is no deal, there would have to be an extension, or a no-deal Brexit, he says. He says the closer we get to 29 March, the more likely an extension becomes. That would be a \u201crational solution\u201d, he says. He says the EU would show \u201cunderstanding\u201d. Extending article 50 to avoid no-deal Brexit would be \u201crational\u201d, Donald Tusk says. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, says he has had three meetings with Theresa May, the most recent this morning. \u201cWe are making good progress\u201d, he says. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, has given an interview to Tatler. It has published a short extract on its website, and it is clear that the full text is unlikely to diminish his reputation for having one of the most colossal egos in Westminster. Here is an extract. [Davis] was, for a long time, Theresa May\u2019s \u2018favourite minister. I am eclectic,\u2019 he goes on. \u2018People call me right-wing but I\u2019m neither right nor left. I\u2019m all over the shop. Confused would be a better description.\u2019 Not that confused. He believes he could \u2013 and perhaps should \u2013 lead the Conservative party. He lost out to David Cameron in 2005 following a leadership campaign that featured women in tight T-shirts captioned, \u2018It\u2019s DD for me.\u2019 Right now, he won\u2019t make any predictions about the leadership. Does he have the credentials? \u2018Yes. And if this were an application for a job as a chief executive, I would probably win it. But it isn\u2019t. And that isn\u2019t the way the decision is done.\u2019 In news terms, the most interesting line in the extract is his admission that he is not certain that Theresa May will be able to survive another year as leader. Here is another extract from the interview, conducted by Charlotte Edwardes. By December, May stood on the brink of a no-confidence vote from her party after the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee received the requisite number of letters from MPs. Davis was widely tipped to take over. Did he put in a letter to the 1922 Committee? \u2018No.\u2019 He couldn\u2019t, he says, be that disloyal. Does she have another year? He sighs. \u2018I\u2019ve no idea. Probably.\u2019 The main press conference to mark the conclusion of the EU-Arab summit is starting now. There is a live stream here. Brexit was not officially on the agenda, but Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, and Donald Tusk, the European council president, are speaking, and it is possible that they will give it a mention. If they do, I will cover it here. Mark Rutte, prime minister of a small European country that would be badly affected by a no-deal Brexit, said this morning that the UK and the EU were \u201csleepwalking\u201d towards that outcome. (See 11.12am.) But Leo Varadkar, prime minister of another small EU country, but the one most at risk from Brexit, said this morning that he did not think no deal would happen, RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly reports. Like most business organisations, the Association of British Insurers has repeatedly spoken out in public about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit. But in a speech this evening its director general, Huw Evans, will go further than before, saying no deal would be \u201can unforgivable act of economic and social self-harm\u201d. According to an extract released in advance, he will tell the ABI annual dinner: A no-deal outcome would be an unforgivable act of economic and social self-harm. It would mean leaving the world\u2019s single biggest trading block overnight with nothing but WTO rules to replace it. This would be wholly inadequate and unprecedented. None of the EU\u2019s 20 largest trading partners trade with the EU on solely WTO terms; they all have deeper agreements in place. And the WTO framework itself is designed to provide a mechanism for states to resolve trade disputes \u2013 it is not designed to be a safety net for the world\u2019s fifth largest economy leaving the world\u2019s biggest trading block. Nor do its rules guarantee market access for the services which make up four fifths of the UK economy. This matters because the EU is - by a very long distance - the largest export market for the UK insurance and long-term savings industry. As an industry we have done everything possible to prepare for no deal, including transferring an estimated 29m insurance contracts and the establishment of nearly 40 EU subsidiaries and branches to minimise disruption to customers. But we still believe very strongly that a conscious decision to opt for no deal would be an act of economic recklessness our great country would live to regret with WTO rules offering little to no protection against the consequences. As a last resort, if the only alternative to no deal is some form of short delay to Brexit, then delay we should. This is from Euronews\u2019 Darren McCaffrey on the meeting between Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, in Sharm El Sheikh this morning. Senior Scottish Liberal Democrats are open to a future merger with the Independent Group (TIG) of MPs, providing it establishes its liberal credentials and holds together as a cohesive force, senior sources have said. Another key issue for senior Lib Dems in Scotland is replacing Vince Cable as UK party leader: Cable has already indicated he will step down after May\u2019s local elections and EU withdrawal, but dissatisfaction at what his seen as his lacklustre leadership is growing. Deeply frustrated that under Cable the party has failed to exploit Labour and Tory divisions over Brexit, and their right- and left-wards drift, some want a leadership contest quickly. Jo Swinson, the MP for East Dunbartonshire, is touted as a leading contender to replace him, as is Ed Davey, the former energy secretary. Speculation about which Scottish politicians, particularly at Holyrood, might defect to TIG has intensified. It is not thought either Kezia Dugdale, the former Scottish Labour leader, nor Ian Murray, the Labour MP for Edinburgh South, are minded to jump first. After originally being in coalition government with Labour during the first two Scottish parliaments, from 1999 to 2007, the Lib Dems are now Holyrood\u2019s smallest party, behind the Greens, with five MSPs. The party suffered badly from the voter backlash at Nick Clegg\u2019s coalition with David Cameron at Westminster, losing all but one of its Commons seats, but recovered in the 2017 snap general election to take four Westminster seats. A pact between TIG and the Lib Dems at Westminster is seen as a logical first step. Some Scottish Lib Dem MSPs, who met for their spring conference in Hamilton last Friday, think their party is the most obvious suitor for TIG at Holyrood, and should merge en masse later this year. Others are cautious, citing nervousness about the unknowns \u2013 few Lib Dems activists know the MPs who make up TIG - but nevertheless excitement at the arrival of a new centrist party. One suggested some Lib Dems might baulk at working with the Sheffield MP Angela Smith, given Labour\u2019s bruising campaigns against them in the city. A source said the key questions were about funding; personalities; a coherent policy platform and seeing how Brexit unfolded. Even so, the bias is towards an eventual merger. \u201cThere is huge potential but we have an awful lot to find out first,\u201d he said. The Office for National Statistics has released figures this morning on the number of deaths of homeless people in England and Wales by local authority area. As you would expect, it says that areas with the highest deprivation have many more deaths relative to their population (nine times as many, to be precise) as the least disadvantaged areas. Here are the five areas with the highest numbers of deaths of homeless people, per head of population, in the five years covered by the data. Brexit should be delayed, my colleague Simon Jenkins writes in an article for Guardian Opinion. \u201cToday\u2019s parliament well mirrors the nation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is implacably split. It cannot make up its mind on how to leave the EU next month. So it should just stop, calm down and think.\u201d Here is Politico Europe\u2019s Tom McTague on the Mark Rutte interview. (See 11.12am.) And here is McTague on what might happen next. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, has told the BBC that the UK is \u201csleepwalking\u201d towards a no-deal Brexit, Laura Kuenssberg reports. Anna Soubry, who left the Conservatives last week to join the Independent Group, has said she is considering taking contempt proceedings against the government if she does not get cabinet papers setting out the dangers of a no-deal Brexit by Wednesday. She tabled an amendment calling for the publication for the Brexit debate two weeks ago. It was expected to pass, and she only withdrew it when the Brexit minister, Chris Heaton-Harris, gave her a verbal assurance from the despatch box that the material would be published. Today Soubry told the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire show that she had not yet seen the no-deal report. She went on: This minister, with the agreement of the government, said \u2018We will give you these papers\u2019. These papers are really, really important. What they show is an impartial, honest appraisal of the grave dangers to our country in trade and economic terms if we leave without a deal. We believe that the public have a right to see those papers. At the moment, I am putting my faith in good ministers who were promising that what I need will be delivered in time for Wednesday\u2019s debate. That\u2019s the critical thing, because it will inform MPs. If not for devolution Scotland might have been independent by now, Tony Blair has said. As the Press Association reports, the former prime minister suggested that without his party offering the devolution referendum in 1997 the country could have left the UK. In an interview with Holyrood magazine, Blair said he believed devolution had been \u201cessentially a success\u201d as Scotland remained within the UK and any regrets he had were over not considering more ways to increase cultural alignment between the two. He went on: Having said that, I think people forget that there was a huge amount of pressure for devolution as an alternative to independence and if we hadn\u2019t offered that alternative, you might have had an independent Scotland by now. Ultimately, I think we overestimated, for sure, the degree to which devolution would quash independence, that\u2019s correct ... But I think were it not for Brexit now, probably the mood in Scotland would be less in favour of independence than for some time. I\u2019m not saying it will happen, because I still think there are very strong arguments against it, and obviously I\u2019m not in favour of it, even after Brexit, if we do Brexit. But you know, I think when I said this before people criticised it, but it seems to me absolutely bloody obvious - if Scotland is in favour of staying in Europe, and you wrench the UK out of Europe, then yep, people who are arguing for independence are going to have another dimension to their argument. It doesn\u2019t mean to say I agree with it, but it\u2019s bound to have an impact. These are from the BBC\u2019s Ros Atkins, who has been interviewing the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, at the EU-Arab summit in Sharm El Sheikh. This is what the Press Association has filed from the government briefing about Theresa May\u2019s meeting with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, this morning. The prime minister is meeting European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday as part of her talks with EU leaders in Sharm El Sheikh, a senior UK government official said. The official said May had a \u201cgood, friendly\u201d 45-minute meeting with Merkel on the fringes of the EU-League of Arab States summit they are attending. The PM and Merkel discussed Brexit and the UK parliament, as well as issues like Syria, the official said. The issue of extending article 50 came up briefly in the meeting, and May reiterated that the UK wanted to leave the EU with a deal on the scheduled date of March 29, the official said. Referring to the PM\u2019s meeting with Merkel, the UK government official said: \u201cThey did discuss Brexit, they discussed UK parliament, things that have been happening in UK parliament, things that are happening this week. \u201cThey spent a decent amount of time talking about foreign policy as well as Brexit.\u201d The official said the issue of extending article 50 came up \u201cfleetingly\u201d, adding \u201cit really wasn\u2019t a focus\u201d. Here is my colleague Matthew Weaver\u2019s story on Tobias Ellwood, the defence minister, hinting that Theresa May could back an extension of article 50. Jon Lansman, the Momentum founder and member of Labour\u2019s national executive committee who is one of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s most long-standing allies, told the Today programme this morning that he thought Labour had underestimated the extent of antisemitism on the party. Lansman, who is Jewish, said: I do think we have a major problem and it always seems to me that we underestimate the scale of it. I think it is a widespread problem. I think it is now obvious that we have a much larger number of people with hardcore antisemitic opinions which unfortunately is polluting the atmosphere in a lot of constituency parties and in particular online. We have to deal with these people. Lansman said the extent of the problem in the party was partly a reflection of its size - 300,000 new members joined after Corbyn became leader - and partly a reflection of its age profile. He explained: There are conspiracy theorists in many parts of the political spectrum, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s exclusive to the Labour party. The Tory party is a smaller party and an elderly party and the role of social media in fomenting and spreading some of the poison is therefore more of a problem in the Labour party. But he said he did not accept the claim from Luciana Berger, who left Labour to join the Independent Group last week largely because of the antisemitic abuse she has received, that Labour was \u201cinstitutionally antisemitic\u201d. And Lansman also said he did not agree with the suggestion from Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, that Corbyn should personally review some antisemitism complaints himself. Lansman said: Jeremy Corbyn has been an anti-racist campaigner all his life, I have known him for decades and I do absolutely believe in his commitment to eradicate that. I think he is overseeing the party\u2019s battle against antisemitism. I\u2019m not sure about him taking personal responsibility for cases. I think if he did that, some people might argue that that would be inappropriate. The 11 MPs in the new Independent Group are holding their first private group meeting in Westminster later today. There has been speculation that they could choose a leader. Chuka Umunna, the former Labour MP, said yesterday that he wanted to play \u201cthe biggest role\u201d in the group, so by the end of the day he could be a leader - although not a party leader, because TIG are not a party yet. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem deputy leader, told the today programme that her party (which, coincidentally, also has 11 MPs) wanted to work with the new group. She said: I think we need to be working together with the Independent Group MPs but we need to find a 2019 way of doing that and I\u2019m open-minded about how that looks. I want to approach this with a very very open mind, potentially to have radical change. It is not very often we get a moment to break up the broken political system and we have that moment now. She also suggested the the Lib Dems could agree a pact with the new group that would see them not standing candidates against each other. When asked if this was an option, she replied: I don\u2019t think we should be taking any of these things off the table ... I will welcome anyone to the Liberal Democrats who shares my liberal values, and obviously I want more people to join the Lib Dems. But I am not going to be petty about this and suggest that I am not going to work with somebody who shares many of my values just because for whatever reason they don\u2019t feel that they can join my party. Theresa May is under growing pressure to agree to extend article 50. Perhaps the clearest evidence that she is coming close to embracing the idea came from May herself yesterday, when she told reporters on her plane as she flew out to the EU-Arab summit in Sharm El Sheikh that \u201cit\u2019s still within our grasp to leave the EU by the 29 March.\u201d She used to assert as fact, without qualification, that Britain would be out at the end of March. Now it is just \u201cwithin our grasp\u201d - a phrase more typically applied to political aspirations that have little chance of being realised, like ending child poverty. But this morning there are three more developments suggesting that May is getting ever closer to embracing the need to extend article 50. 1) The Daily Telegraph (paywall) reports that Number 10 has drawn up contingency plans to extend article 50 for two months. In a story that is not being denied by government sources, who point out that you would expect the government to have contingency plans for all eventualities, Steven Swinford and Anna Mikhailova report: Brexit will be delayed for up to two months under plans being considered by Theresa May to extend Article 50, the Telegraph has learned. Downing Street officials have drawn up a series of options in a bid to avoid resignations by ministers determined to support a backbench bid to take no deal off the table this week ... While the Downing Street plans do not specify the length of the extension, ministers believe it will be no longer than two months - avoiding the need for the UK to participate in European parliament elections. On Wednesday the Commons will vote on a backbench bill tabled by Yvette Cooper, a senior Labour MP, that would force Mrs May to request an extension of Article 50 if a deal has not been reached by March 13. The prime minister could avert a rebellion by Tory MPs and a Commons defeat by committing to requesting a Brexit delay herself, although in doing so risks alienating Eurosceptic Tory MPs. \u201cIt\u2019s very finely balanced,\u201d a source said. 2) The Conservative MP Simon Hart, with the support of members of the Brexit Delivery Group (Tories who want to deliver Brexit, while avoiding no deal), has drawn up an amendment for the Brexit vote on Wednesday that would allow MPs to vote for a plan to avoid no deal without having to pass a new law, as the Yvette Cooper amendment proposes. This would be more acceptable to Number 10 than Cooper, the FT reports (paywall): Under the proposal, which is set to be tabled as an amendment on Wednesday, the government would be legally obliged to offer MPs the option of requesting an extension in the article 50 exit process beyond March 29. EU leaders have said they are likely to agree to some form of extension, but Mrs May has said she will not ask for one. A counterproposal, led by Conservative MPs Simon Hart and Andrew Percy, would delay Brexit day to May 23, the start of the European parliament elections, if parliament in Westminster has not approved a deal by March 12. In an email to 50 members of the Brexit Delivery Group of moderate Tory MPs, Mr Hart said the amendment \u201ccould offer some colleagues who have indicated they might support Letwin-Cooper a way out, whilst also removing the danger of a crashing out at the end of March without a deal\u201d. The plan seeks to avoid \u201cthe constitutional upheaval\u201d of the Cooper amendment, and therefore win Downing Street\u2019s support. But as a result, it does not set out legislative moves to tie the government\u2019s hands. \u201cIt is just an expression of opinion,\u201d said Sir Oliver. 3) Tobias Ellwood, a defence minister and one of those Tories in government who has hinted that he would vote for Cooper to avoid the risk of a no-deal Brexit, told the Today programme this morning that he thought May might announce an article 50 extension herself. May was \u201clistening\u201d to the concerns of MPs about no deal, he said. Asked if she could announce an article 50 extension after her return from talks with other EU leaders in Egypt, he replied: You need to wait and hear what she has to say when she gets back. That, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m encouraging that to happen because it\u2019s not in anybody\u2019s interest to see no deal. He also said that May should be willing to defy Tory Brexiters in the European Research Group on this point. (The ERG think it would be a mistake to rule out a no-deal Brexit.) Ellwood said: [May] has done her utmost to appease the ERG. The referendum itself was done with them in mind, the article 50 letter was sent with them in mind, the motions have been delayed and written with the ERG in mind. It\u2019s now important for them to fall in line. We would not be having this conversation about no deal if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that, I\u2019m afraid, there\u2019s been a bloc voice in our party that has hindered the prime minister getting this across the line. She may get the necessary concessions and legal agreements concerning the backstop, but, ultimately, the clock is ticking down. If we cannot get this deal across the line, we are facing the prospect of having to extend. Ellwood\u2019s interview gave some journalists the impression that he knew more about what might happen than he was actually letting on. This is from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh. And this is from PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am (UK time): Theresa May\u2019s press spokesman is due to brief journalists on May\u2019s meetings with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, this morning on the margins of the EU-Arab summit in Sharm El Sheikh. 10am: The Bank of England holds a press conference. 1.30pm (UK time): May holds a press conference. 2.30pm: Sajid Javid, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on the Brexit debate, and any further fall-out from last week\u2019s defections from Labour and the Conservative party. I will post a summary at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

The fixtures come thick but not that fast. If they can finish off Schalke in two weeks\u2019 time and get past Swansea in the FA Cup there is one obvious logjam to come. Between 6 April and 24 April City would play six high-pressure games in 19 days, a run that goes: FA Cup semi; Champions League quarter-final (first leg); Crystal Palace away; Champions League quarter-final (second leg); Tottenham at home; Manchester United away.</p> <p>Get through another flurry around the Champions League semi-finals and the season ends in fairly orderly fashion. Brighton away is the final Premier League fixture on 12 May. The FA Cup final is on 18 May. The distant prospect of a Champions League final would round things off on the first day of June.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The United treble team in 1999 played seven games in 26 days.

By comparison Manchester United\u2019s treble-winning season 20 years ago finished on 26 May, with United required to tie up three trophies in the final 10 days.</p> <p>That United team played seven games in 26 days from the start of May. Should City get as far, they would end with four games in 28 days. Where does the advantage lie? United carried all before them in a glorious adrenal rush, with no time to look down or feel any fear. Could there be another kind of difficulty in that \u201ccold time\u201d between fixtures?</p> <p>There are some more positive lessons to be learned along the way. United had seven different goalscorers in their last seven games, the burden shared as the line approached. And it is here that City also have deeper gears.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/25/kepa-chelsea-carabao-cup-final-maurizio-sarri\">Kepa farce distracted his teammates and disrespected the entire game | Richard Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The only really worrying note is the injury sustained on Sunday by Fernandinho. John Stones\u2019s return from his hamstring twang will also be vital: Vincent Kompany is a great club servant but isolated against a player like Eden Hazard he wheels around like a passenger ferry with a wonky rear thruster these days.</p> <p>On the plus side Bernardo Silva is in excellent shape, all non-stop ferreting intelligence on and off the ball. Left-back has looked like a problem but Oleksandr Zinchenko was magnificent at Wembley. Sergio Ag\u00fcero is in his absolute pomp right now. Raheem Sterling has five goals and four assists in 10 games, a man running hot at just the right time.</p> <p>Comparisons are of course odious \u2013 and indeed meaningless given the complete re-gearing of every part of football\u2019s surfaces from year to year. But with 20 games to win them all, the question will naturally be asked as to where such an achievement would rank.</p> <p>Some will point to the thinning out at the very top, the fact fewer clubs are winning more trophies generally. But it would be incorrect to belittle this as a bought success, a triumph devalued by the extreme amounts of money involved.</p> <p>For a start nobody wins anything these days without spending. That much is a given. Secondly this is above all a City team marked out by the more human elements. To miss the fact Guardiola has improved almost every one of his players, that the team has a system and a way of playing that is thrillingly well-grooved, that City have resisted the urge simply to buy ready-made world stars, is to miss the basic beauty of sport altogether.</p> <p>The one area lacking is some sense of internal, organic growth. Every sporting triumph lacks a little something without an element of home-made talent. United\u2019s treble winners had seven academy products playing regularly in the first team. The greatest British European triumph of all, Celtic in 1967, saw Jock Stein pick a team drawn entirely from the Glasgow districts. City remains a portable project, all outsourced parts, and one that has yet to spawn a regular home-grown City player since the Abu Dhabi takeover. Such is the way of modern football elsewhere too. For now Sunday\u2019s cup final leaves this fine City team 20 games from a sporting feat that will most likely prove beyond them but which has never felt quite so close at hand.</p>",

So, for now, let\u2019s just take a moment to dream. Straight away City have an advantage on timing. The fixtures come thick but not that fast. If they can finish off Schalke in two weeks\u2019 time and get past Swansea in the FA Cup there is one obvious logjam to come. Between 6 April and 24 April City would play six high-pressure games in 19 days, a run that goes: FA Cup semi; Champions League quarter-final (first leg); Crystal Palace away; Champions League quarter-final (second leg); Tottenham at home; Manchester United away. Get through another flurry around the Champions League semi-finals and the season ends in fairly orderly fashion. Brighton away is the final Premier League fixture on 12 May. The FA Cup final is on 18 May. The distant prospect of a Champions League final would round things off on the first day of June. It is an unusually well spaced-out endgame, and a favourable turn for any club caught in the familiar English slog through the spring. By comparison Manchester United\u2019s treble-winning season 20 years ago finished on 26 May, with United required to tie up three trophies in the final 10 days. That United team played seven games in 26 days from the start of May. Should City get as far, they would end with four games in 28 days. Where does the advantage lie? United carried all before them in a glorious adrenal rush, with no time to look down or feel any fear. Could there be another kind of difficulty in that \u201ccold time\u201d between fixtures? There are some more positive lessons to be learned along the way. United had seven different goalscorers in their last seven games, the burden shared as the line approached. And it is here that City also have deeper gears. The only really worrying note is the injury sustained on Sunday by Fernandinho. John Stones\u2019s return from his hamstring twang will also be vital: Vincent Kompany is a great club servant but isolated against a player like Eden Hazard he wheels around like a passenger ferry with a wonky rear thruster these days. On the plus side Bernardo Silva is in excellent shape, all non-stop ferreting intelligence on and off the ball. Left-back has looked like a problem but Oleksandr Zinchenko was magnificent at Wembley. Sergio Ag\u00fcero is in his absolute pomp right now. Raheem Sterling has five goals and four assists in 10 games, a man running hot at just the right time. Comparisons are of course odious \u2013 and indeed meaningless given the complete re-gearing of every part of football\u2019s surfaces from year to year. But with 20 games to win them all, the question will naturally be asked as to where such an achievement would rank. Some will point to the thinning out at the very top, the fact fewer clubs are winning more trophies generally. But it would be incorrect to belittle this as a bought success, a triumph devalued by the extreme amounts of money involved. For a start nobody wins anything these days without spending. That much is a given. Secondly this is above all a City team marked out by the more human elements. To miss the fact Guardiola has improved almost every one of his players, that the team has a system and a way of playing that is thrillingly well-grooved, that City have resisted the urge simply to buy ready-made world stars, is to miss the basic beauty of sport altogether. The one area lacking is some sense of internal, organic growth. Every sporting triumph lacks a little something without an element of home-made talent. United\u2019s treble winners had seven academy products playing regularly in the first team. The greatest British European triumph of all, Celtic in 1967, saw Jock Stein pick a team drawn entirely from the Glasgow districts. City remains a portable project, all outsourced parts, and one that has yet to spawn a regular home-grown City player since the Abu Dhabi takeover. Such is the way of modern football elsewhere too. For now Sunday\u2019s cup final leaves this fine City team 20 games from a sporting feat that will most likely prove beyond them but which has never felt quite so close at hand.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has finally thrown his party\u2019s weight behind a second EU referendum, backing moves for a fresh poll with remain on the ballot paper if Labour should fail to get its own version of a Brexit deal passed this week. The decision to give the party\u2019s backing to a second referendum follows a concerted push by the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, and the deputy leader, Tom Watson, who fear any further delay could have led to more defections to the breakaway Independent Group (TIG), whose members all back a second referendum. Although the move has delighted MPs who are backing the People\u2019s Vote campaign, Corbyn is likely to face determined opposition from dozens of MPs in leave seats if the party whips to back a second referendum, including a significant number of frontbenchers. The former shadow minister Lucy Powell said she believed at least 25 MPs would vote against any whip to back a second referendum, meaning that it would face an uphill struggle to pass the Commons without significant Conservative support. A private briefing sent to Labour MPs on Monday night and seen by the Guardian makes it clear that Labour\u2019s policy would be to include remain as an option in any future referendum. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said that any referendum would need to have a credible leave option and remain,\u201d the briefing said. \u201cObviously at this stage that is yet to be decided and would have to be agreed by parliament.\u201d The briefing also makes it clear that the party would not support no deal being included on the ballot paper. \u201cThere\u2019s no majority for a no-deal outcome and Labour would not countenance supporting no deal as an option,\u201d the briefing says. \u201cWhat we are calling for is a referendum to confirm a Brexit deal, not to proceed to no deal.\u201d The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, indicated on Monday evening that both she and Corbyn would campaign for remain if there were a future public vote. \u201cWe would have a referendum on whatever deal it is that may or may not pass through parliament and we would be saying to people: \u2018Do you want this, or do you want to remain?\u2019\u201d she told Channel 4 News. Thornberry said she \u201cwould certainly be campaigning for us to remain\u201d in those circumstances and, when asked if Corbyn shared that view, she added: \u201cIf it\u2019s a choice between a disastrous Tory Brexit or no deal, and remaining, then that is what we will have to do.\u201d The redrawing of Labour\u2019s objectives is likely to stem any fresh flood of resignations to TIG, whose members include the former Labour MPs Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie as well as the ex-Tory MP Anna Soubry, all key figures in the People\u2019s Vote movement. Corbyn told MPs the party would back a fresh poll as a final resort in order to stop \u201ca damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country\u201d. Speaking to MPs on Monday night, a week after seven MPs who backed a referendum quit the party, Corbyn said Labour would first table its own version of a Brexit deal, including a permanent customs union. That amendment is set to be tabled to the government\u2019s Brexit motion on Wednesday, when Labour will also whip to back another amendment tabled by Yvette Cooper and the Tory Oliver Letwin, which would legislate for a delay to the UK\u2019s exit date in order to avoid no deal. May is expected to make a last-ditch attempt to avoid a serious cabinet rebellion over that amendment this week. The Guardian reported last week that at least four cabinet ministers and almost a dozen junior ministers and many others on the government payroll were ready to rebel and vote for the measure. The prime minister\u2019s most likely option is a pledge to let MPs vote on delaying Brexit if the withdrawal deal does not pass by 12 March, though Cooper and Letwin\u2019s backers have suggested they will reject that approach. Party sources said Labour would not introduce or back any amendment for a second referendum this week, but see the crunch point at the next opportunity \u2013 likely to be the next meaningful vote on the Brexit deal that May has promised to hold by 12 March. It is highly unlikely Labour\u2019s amendment on its own Brexit deal will pass on Wednesday, making it almost inevitable the party will move to back another referendum. Corbyn told MPs that Labour \u201ccannot and will not accept\u201d May running down the clock towards no deal. \u201cOne way or another, we will do everything in our power to prevent no deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May\u2019s overwhelmingly rejected deal,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country.\u201d Yet recriminations came from leave-supporting Labour MPs almost immediately in the private meeting on Monday night. John Mann, a Brexit supporter, said the decision to back a second referendum would cost Labour in the Midlands and the north. \u201cThe price will stop you being prime minister,\u201d he told the meeting. Outside the meeting, the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said he had \u201cdeep reservations\u201d about the possibility of a second referendum and suggested it would not pass the House of Commons. \u201cI think it would be deeply divisive. It has a corrosive impact on the sovereignty of parliament and it is not clear to me still what should be on the ballot paper,\u201d he said. It is understood that about a dozen shadow ministers could consider their positions if Labour whips MPs to back a second referendum. Those who vocally oppose a second referendum include the shadow justice minister Gloria de Piero, the shadow housing minister Melanie Onn and shadow education minister Tracy Brabin as well as backbenchers including Caroline Flint, Gareth Snell and Lisa Nandy. Seventeen Labour MPs, including eight shadow ministers, voted against or abstained on Cooper\u2019s previous amendment to extend article 50 last month. Future Labour support for a second referendum could come in the form of backing for a proposed amendment to the meaningful vote proposed by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson. That proposal would approve May\u2019s deal subject to a fresh referendum, though senior Labour officials are thought to be uneasy about backing any amendment that endorses the Tory Brexit deal.",

But the group is still keen to secure the backing of cabinet ministers and junior ministers who have threatened to defy the government whip.</p> <p>Three cabinet ministers \u2013 Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark \u2013 threw down the gauntlet to May at the weekend as they urged her to remove the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. It is understood they are all planning to listen carefully to what May has to offer on Tuesday, raising the possibility that they will back away from having to resign or be sacked. One alternative is that May offers a free vote to allow ministers to vote for the Cooper-Letwin amendment without having to leave their government positions.</p> <p>Three other ministers have urged May to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. Writing in the Daily Mail, Richard Harrington, Claire Perry and Margot James said the government should extend article 50 to avoid leaving with no agreement on 29 March. The paper also claimed that 15 ministers would be ready to resign to stop no deal. </p> <p>May insisted on Tuesday that she did not want a delay to Brexit but it was discussed in meetings with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/25/chaotic-brexit-or-extension-article-50-donald-tusk\">Donald Tusk</a>, the European council president, at a summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.</p> <p>\u201cAn extension to article 50, a delay in this process, doesn\u2019t deliver a decision in parliament, it doesn\u2019t deliver a deal,\u201d she said at a separate press conference. \u201cAll it does is precisely what the word \u2018delay\u2019 says.

I\u2019ve had a real sense from the meetings I\u2019ve had here and the conversations I\u2019ve had in recent days that we can achieve that deal. It\u2019s within our grasp to leave with a deal on 29 March and that\u2019s where all of my energies are going to be focused.\u201d</p> <p>However, even some of her most loyal supporters in parliament told the Guardian that a delay to Brexit was \u201cpretty much inevitable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no way we would get the legislation through in time now anyway. It\u2019s not really clear why she is still insisting we can. What we need is some pitch-rolling for a short delay,\u201d one MP said.</p> <p>Backers of the Cooper-Letwin amendment said it was still crucial to make sure a no-deal Brexit is ruled out this week.</p> <p>Antoinette Sandbach, a Conservative MP who supports the Cooper-Letwin amendment, said: \u201cNo deal must be ruled out this week. Anything else is frankly irresponsible for people trying to plan businesses and their lives.\u201d</p> <p>Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general under David Cameron, said the suggestion of a short, time-limited delay to Brexit if May\u2019s deal does not pass was \u201cabsolutely not good enough\u201d.</p> <p>Nick Boles, writing in the Evening Standard, said it was \u201cthe last chance saloon\u201d and warned his colleagues not to fall for the prime minister\u2019s concession if it falls short of ruling out a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>Some supporters of May\u2019s deal in parliament \u2013 known as the Brexit delivery group \u2013 had planned to table a rival amendment in favour of a time-limited delay but they are not confident of enough support for it to be chosen and may not pursue it.</p> <p>Among European politicians, several warned that time was running out and reflected gloomily on May\u2019s chances of winning enough support from hardline Eurosceptic Tories and the Democratic Unionist party to get her deal through parliament. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/24/theresa-may-postpones-meaningful-vote-on-final-brexit-deal\">delaying the meaningful vote on the deal</a>, previously scheduled for this week, May has said she will return to the Commons on 12 March to put it to MPs.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/25/chaotic-brexit-or-extension-article-50-donald-tusk\">Donald Tusk, the European Council president, warned</a> that May was unlikely to get her revised deal through the House of Commons as it currently stands, leaving the UK with the option of \u201ca chaotic Brexit\u201d or an extension of its membership of the EU beyond 29 March.</p> <p>The European council president revealed that he and the prime minister had walked through the legal process that would need to be followed to delay Brexit.</p> <p>As she seeks to shorten the timetable for approval of a Brexit deal before 29 March, May signalled it could be possible for MPs to vote on an agreement before it has been formally approved on 22 March by the EU.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be possible to do it either way and I would hope that we have that meaningful vote by the 12th,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is due to re-engage with the British team, including Downing Street\u2019s senior Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, in Brussels on Tuesday.</p> <p>The two sides are drafting text that puts previous assurances of the temporary nature of the backstop, contained in letters from Tusk and Juncker late last year, into a legally-binding form.</p> <p>The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, who also met May for talks in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, said he feared that the UK was \u201csleepwalking\u201d to a no-deal Brexit. He warned May that the EU was determined to avoid granting a short extension only to have to repeatedly revisit the issue due to a lack of direction in London.</p>",

May is expected to make a last-ditch attempt to avoid a cabinet rebellion, before a vote on Wednesday on a cross-party amendment laid by the Tory Oliver Letwin and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper that would in effect rule out a no-deal scenario. The prime minister\u2019s most likely option is a pledge to let MPs vote on delaying Brexit for a short time if she does renegotiate her withdrawal deal and win support for it before 12 March. However, those leading efforts to get a no-deal Brexit taken off the table said the proposal was \u201cabsolutely not good enough\u201d, as they urged cabinet and junior ministers threatening to resign over the issue to hold their nerve. They believe they have enough promises from MPs to pass the Cooper-Letwin amendment, especially now the Labour frontbench has pledged its support. But the group is still keen to secure the backing of cabinet ministers and junior ministers who have threatened to defy the government whip. Three cabinet ministers \u2013 Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark \u2013 threw down the gauntlet to May at the weekend as they urged her to remove the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. It is understood they are all planning to listen carefully to what May has to offer on Tuesday, raising the possibility that they will back away from having to resign or be sacked. One alternative is that May offers a free vote to allow ministers to vote for the Cooper-Letwin amendment without having to leave their government positions. Three other ministers have urged May to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. Writing in the Daily Mail, Richard Harrington, Claire Perry and Margot James said the government should extend article 50 to avoid leaving with no agreement on 29 March. The paper also claimed that 15 ministers would be ready to resign to stop no deal. May insisted on Tuesday that she did not want a delay to Brexit but it was discussed in meetings with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Donald Tusk, the European council president, at a summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. \u201cAn extension to article 50, a delay in this process, doesn\u2019t deliver a decision in parliament, it doesn\u2019t deliver a deal,\u201d she said at a separate press conference. \u201cAll it does is precisely what the word \u2018delay\u2019 says. Any extension of article 50 isn\u2019t addressing the issues. \u201cWe have it within our grasp. I\u2019ve had a real sense from the meetings I\u2019ve had here and the conversations I\u2019ve had in recent days that we can achieve that deal. It\u2019s within our grasp to leave with a deal on 29 March and that\u2019s where all of my energies are going to be focused.\u201d However, even some of her most loyal supporters in parliament told the Guardian that a delay to Brexit was \u201cpretty much inevitable\u201d. \u201cThere is no way we would get the legislation through in time now anyway. It\u2019s not really clear why she is still insisting we can. What we need is some pitch-rolling for a short delay,\u201d one MP said. Backers of the Cooper-Letwin amendment said it was still crucial to make sure a no-deal Brexit is ruled out this week. Antoinette Sandbach, a Conservative MP who supports the Cooper-Letwin amendment, said: \u201cNo deal must be ruled out this week. Anything else is frankly irresponsible for people trying to plan businesses and their lives.\u201d Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general under David Cameron, said the suggestion of a short, time-limited delay to Brexit if May\u2019s deal does not pass was \u201cabsolutely not good enough\u201d. Nick Boles, writing in the Evening Standard, said it was \u201cthe last chance saloon\u201d and warned his colleagues not to fall for the prime minister\u2019s concession if it falls short of ruling out a no-deal Brexit. Some supporters of May\u2019s deal in parliament \u2013 known as the Brexit delivery group \u2013 had planned to table a rival amendment in favour of a time-limited delay but they are not confident of enough support for it to be chosen and may not pursue it. Among European politicians, several warned that time was running out and reflected gloomily on May\u2019s chances of winning enough support from hardline Eurosceptic Tories and the Democratic Unionist party to get her deal through parliament. After delaying the meaningful vote on the deal, previously scheduled for this week, May has said she will return to the Commons on 12 March to put it to MPs. Meanwhile, Donald Tusk, the European Council president, warned that May was unlikely to get her revised deal through the House of Commons as it currently stands, leaving the UK with the option of \u201ca chaotic Brexit\u201d or an extension of its membership of the EU beyond 29 March. The European council president revealed that he and the prime minister had walked through the legal process that would need to be followed to delay Brexit. As she seeks to shorten the timetable for approval of a Brexit deal before 29 March, May signalled it could be possible for MPs to vote on an agreement before it has been formally approved on 22 March by the EU. \u201cIt would be possible to do it either way and I would hope that we have that meaningful vote by the 12th,\u201d she said. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is due to re-engage with the British team, including Downing Street\u2019s senior Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, in Brussels on Tuesday. The two sides are drafting text that puts previous assurances of the temporary nature of the backstop, contained in letters from Tusk and Juncker late last year, into a legally-binding form. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, who also met May for talks in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, said he feared that the UK was \u201csleepwalking\u201d to a no-deal Brexit. He warned May that the EU was determined to avoid granting a short extension only to have to repeatedly revisit the issue due to a lack of direction in London.",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of youth climate activists marched on Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s Washington office and 42 of them were arrested by police, according to organizers. The protesters \u2013 who planned for the arrests \u2013 were led with their hands behind their backs to a police bus as supporters chanted: \u201cWhich side are you on now? Which side are you on?\u201d They filled the Republican leader\u2019s office and the hallway outside, with constituents from his home state of Kentucky telling stories about poverty and their fears of the human cost of climate change. The group, the Sunrise Movement, which included high schoolers, demanded to talk to McConnell about the Green New Deal (GND), a proposal introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey. The GND would radically reduce greenhouse gases and try to lessen social inequity. Republicans have condemned it, and some Democrats have said it is not feasible in the 10-year timeframe proposed. McConnell has said the Senate will vote on the proposal, in a move that could put centrist Democrats in a difficult position. The Sunrise Movement called McConnell\u2019s plans for a vote a \u201cshameful ploy\u201d. They say he has fought any action to stall global warming. A staffer greeted the group and took down contact information. Protesters from Kentucky said they have repeatedly sought meetings with McConnell. Robert Steurer, a spokesman for McConnell, said: \u201cAs with all Kentuckians visiting DC, we welcomed them to the office today. It\u2019s worth noting that two weeks before, Senator McConnell had already announced that he will be bringing the Green New Deal up for a vote in the US Senate. Also last week, Senator McConnell\u2019s state director met with a group of students from the organization in the Louisville office to discuss the issue.\u201d One protester from Kentucky, Jenny Bencomo-Suarez, yelled inside McConnell\u2019s office: \u201cHe has not answered a damn voicemail.\u201d She said: \u201cHe has consistently denied access to us \u2013 access to resources, access to jobs, living wages, healthcare and the right to sustain ourselves in a livable, breathable future.\u201d Destine Rigsby, a 17-year-old from Louisville, said of McConnell, who did not appear: \u201cYou line your pockets while we die in floods and choke on the air we breathe, yet you don\u2019t even have the decency to look us in the eyes.\u201d Last week, California Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein faced criticism over her response to a group of children and teenagers from Sunrise who were also asking her to support the GND. A video of the incident went viral on Twitter after Feinstein appeared to lecture the youngsters. The group later accused her of reacting \u201cwith smugness + disrespect\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Tom Watson has said he will take personal charge of antisemitism and bullying complaints made by MPs to bring them to the attention of the Labour leadership, telling colleagues he will hold the party\u2019s management of the complaints to account. In a separate attempt to stop further defections, the Guardian understands that Labour could delay the start of re-election battles. Labour is set to put back the start of the formal MP selection process, due to begin in a few weeks, which could have led to vast numbers of MPs facing deselection. The party\u2019s governing national executive committee was expecting a paper to approve the start of the process at its next meeting in March, but this is now expected to be delayed for fear that imminent deselection fights will prompt dozens more MPs to quit the party. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to further antagonise,\u201d a party source said. In an email sent before Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s appearance at a meeting of MPs on Monday night, Watson promised to work on the bullying problem. One Labour source described the step as \u201ceffectively creating a parallel disciplinary process\u201d. Watson said he and his team would now be \u201clogging and monitoring all complaints\u201d so he could raise them himself with the leadership and with the NEC. He has called on Corbyn to tackle \u201ca crisis for the soul of the Labour party\u201d or risk many more defections to the Independent Group after nine MPs quit the party last week, with at least three citing antisemitism and bullying as their main motivation. Watson, who has challenged Corbyn directly to be more robust, was also critical on Sunday of Labour\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby. \u201cVery patently, the Jennie Formby reforms have not been adequate. They have not succeeded,\u201d Watson said in an interview with BBC One\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. Watson said in his email, seen by the Guardian: \u201cOver recent weeks a number of colleagues have shared their frustration that incidents of antisemitic, racist abuse and bullying have not been dealt with in an adequate and timely manner or that colleagues have not been informed of the outcome of party investigations. \u201cIn response to these concerns, I requested that the general secretary improve procedures by appointing a named member of staff that could be a point of contact for colleagues to raise cases and be updated on progress. Jennie Formby was very clear that she sees it as her responsibility to be your point of contact.\u201d Watson said MPs should email Formby directly but requested that he also be shown any complaints submitted to her so that he could track their progress. \u201cAs your deputy leader I am deeply alarmed at the amount of abuse that colleagues are receiving from within the party,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to properly assess and monitor the scale of the problem, I would like to see any issue or complaint you raise with the general secretary. From now on my team will be logging and monitoring all complaints.

The complaints he had forwarded included Labour members sending tweets linking Hitler and the Rothschilds, accusing Jews of murdering children and questioning whether Jewish MPs and councillors had \u201chuman blood\u201d. All of the cases had been raised by Watson or other Labour MPs over a period of several months, but no action had been reported back to those who had raised the complaints, he said. Earlier on Monday, Jon Lansman, chair of the leftwing grassroots group Momentum and an NEC member, said antisemitism was a far more widespread problem in the party than he had previously realised and said he felt \u201cregret, sadness and some shame\u201d at the decision of the Jewish MP Luciana Berger to quit the party.",

But sources at the European parliament insisted Chauprade had no access to confidential documents that typically include reports from EU foreign embassies to Brussels or negotiating objectives for EU trade deals. \u201cAssistants and trainees to MEPs do not have access to confidential documents,\u201d a source said. \u201cIn fact, Mr Chauprade himself has never had access to confidential documents.\u201d A typical trainee would have free access to committee rooms and the plenary debating chamber, to attend events that are usually live-streamed. Peskov\u2019s daughter could also attend some private meetings, such as the monthly gathering of the EFDD group, which is usually chaired by Farage. MEPs can choose to hire interns from non-EU countries as long as the trainee meets residence requirements. Chauprade said: \u201cThe European parliament claims it is against racism but all your hear from its Europhile members is anti-Americanism jingoism and conspiratorial Russophobia.\u201d The French MEP, who once described Russia as \u201cthe hope of the world against new totalitarianism\u201d, was a prominent supporter of Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea. He was part of a team of election monitors working for a pro-Kremlin organisation that declared the disputed referendum in 2014 free and fair.",

      "bodyText": "Karren Brady has quit as chair of Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail empire and faced immediate questions over what she knew of alleged sexual and racial harassment by the disgraced business tycoon. Brady walked away after two years in the job and a fortnight after she vowed to remain in her post out of a \u201csense of duty\u201d to look out for the firm\u2019s staff, including her daughter, who works on Topshop\u2019s social media accounts. The Labour MP Jess Phillips called on Brady, 49, to \u201canswer to what went on under her watch\u201d following claims that Green\u2019s company paid two staff about \u00a31m each to settle sexual harassment and racial abuse claims. The allegations include that the billionaire groped a female employee and told a black executive that his \u201cproblem\u201d was that he was still \u201cthrowing spears in the jungle\u201d. Two other female employees received hundreds of thousands of pounds each after alleging that Green had grabbed one woman by the face and put another in a headlock. Brady, a Conservative peer, was chair of Taveta Investments, the company that ultimately owns the Green family empire of Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins outlets. A star of The Apprentice and campaigner for \u201cstrong female leadership\u201d, Brady quit following mounting pressure to speak out against Green. She refused to explain why she had resigned. Taveta also announced the resignation of the non-executive director Sharon Brown, an experienced retail executive. Phillips, the MP for Birmingham Yardley, who sits on the women and equalities committee and backbench business committee, said: \u201cKarren Brady will still have to answer to what went on under her watch and so she should, but it is Green who is ultimately responsible and, like always, it feels like powerful men can get away with anything.\u201d Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said Brady \u201chas decided she can\u2019t defend the indefensible\u201d. Green, 66, who was described by a committee of MPs as the \u201cthe unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d for his role in the collapse of BHS, has said he \u201ccategorically\u201d denies any \u201cunlawful sexual or racist behaviour\u201d. The Dragon\u2019s Den star Duncan Bannatyne had described Brady as a \u201chypocrite\u201d for continuing to work for Green despite using her high profile to attack \u201cserial predators\u201d such as the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, the actor Kevin Spacey and the former minister Michael Fallon. \u201cI think it\u2019s disgusting that she\u2019s on the payroll of a billionaire who hasn\u2019t got a great history with women,\u201d Bannatyne said this month. Brady had refused to quit, saying two weeks ago: \u201cI hope you would agree that walking away is the easy thing to do; staying in the role and ensuring the company is robust going forward is much harder.\u201d Brady, who has built a reputation as one of the UK\u2019s most prominent and successful female business leaders, has a track record of publicly shaming powerful men accused of sexual harassment. She denounced Weinstein as \u201ca serial predator with such colossal amounts of power that people think they have no choice but to put up with grotesque advances if they want a career in Hollywood\u201d. In her column for the Sun, she said: \u201cWhat Michael Fallon [who resigned as defence secretary in 2017 over inappropriate flirtation], Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey [who is accused of sexually harassing actors] are accused of abusing their power in an organisation to get someone to do something they don\u2019t want to do, or tolerate something they don\u2019t like. \u201cLots of men are asking: \u2018When is it appropriate to touch a colleague?\u2019 If you are in doubt, how about \u2026 NEVER?\u201d In another column, she wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s not just film. There is a Harvey Weinstein in every industry \u2013 the man at the top who abuses their power, who has no respect for women, who thinks women owe him something and it is a perfectly reasonable trade-off to exchange sex for work.\u201d Brady has not spoken about the allegations against Green. In her book Strong Woman, she said: \u201cHe is without doubt the most dynamic, the most energetic, the most relentless businessperson I have ever come across, a whirlwind of energy and ideas.\u201d Bannatyne said on Monday that Brady \u201cshould be answering questions about what she knew of the alleged non-disclosure agreements\u201d. Green appointed Brady as chair of Taveta in 2017 with a mandate to \u201cbeef up corporate oversight\u201d and \u201csort out\u201d corporate governance problems. She has been on the board of Taveta, which is controlled by Green\u2019s wife, Tina, since 2010.

      "bodyText": "The global economy faces escalating risks from rising levels of corporate debt, with companies around the world needing to repay or refinance as much as $4tn (\u00a33.1tn) over the next three years, according to the OECD. Sounding the alarm over the scale of the debt mountain built up over the past decade since the last financial crisis, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that global company borrowing has ballooned to reach $13tn by the end of last year \u2013 more than double the level before the 2008 crash. Nearly the equivalent of the entire US Federal Reserve balance sheet \u2013 roughly $4tn \u2013 will need to be repaid or refinanced over the coming years, the report said. However, the task is complicated by cooling economic growth from trade tensions and a slower rate of expansion in China, potentially hindering the ability of firms to generate the income to repay the loans. Financial market investors have grown increasingly concerned that high debt levels in the US could turn a looming slowdown for the world\u2019s largest economy into a full-blown recession. High debt levels in several other nations as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates has also rattled financial markets in recent months. According to research from the Economist Intelligence Unit, a potential meltdown in the US bond market is the second biggest risk to the world economy after the US-China trade standoff, amid a combination of global economic headwinds \u201cmore wide-ranging and complex than at any point since the great recession\u201d. The International Monetary Fund has previously warned of gathering \u201cstorm clouds\u201d for the world economy, including from trade tensions and heightened levels of debt \u2013 particularly in China. Corporate borrowing levels have rapidly accelerated over the past decade amid rock-bottom interest rates from major central banks, after they cut borrowing costs in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis in order to avert the last recession turning into another great depression. Central banks have, however, begun to raise interest rates once more, raising the risk that some companies could run into difficulty keeping up with repayments. Compared with annual average borrowing in the corporate bond markets worth $864bn during the years leading up the crisis, the OECD said that between 2008 and 2018 the global average skyrocketed to $1.7tn per year. Chinese company debt in particular has rapidly accelerated, raising alarm bells as the level of corporate borrowing soared to reach $2.8tn by the end of 2018, up by as much as 395% compared to a decade ago. The OECD warned that the share of the lowest-quality bonds \u2013 sold by less financially resilient companies to bond market investors \u2013 stood at 54%, a historical high. Central bankers have also become increasingly worried over the rapid growth in US leveraged loans \u2013 lending to already highly indebted companies \u2013 in recent months. \u201cIn the case of a downturn, highly leveraged companies would face difficulties in servicing their debt, which in turn, through lower investment and higher default rates, could amplify the effects of a downturn,\u201d the OECD report said. The Economist Intelligence Unit said there was a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d that the US debt burden would turn the next economic downturn into a recession. \u201cIn this scenario, a US recession would exacerbate a global slowdown, with countries affected by declining US demand for goods and investment.\u201d There are, however, hopes that the current debt pile can be managed safely. The Fed has adopted a more cautious stance in recent months as concerns intensify over the health of the global economy. The Fed had increased rates to a range between 2.25% and 2.5% as recently as December, in the ninth such move since late 2015. Indications of the potential future direction of US interest rates may become clearer on Tuesday and Wednesday, when Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, appears before the US Congress.

It was his fourth prison sentence in the past 25 years and, as the Guardian revealed in September, the man who was described in court as an \u201cindustrial-scale child molester\u201d is also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/06/jailed-football-coach-barry-bennell-may-face-further-abuse-charges\" title=\"\">facing the possibility of another criminal trial</a> involving nine more complainants alleging child rape. As of January last year, at least 97 people \u2013 though the number is now thought to be beyond 100 \u2013 had reported Bennell on the back of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/16/andy-woodward\" title=\"\">the interview Andy Woodward</a>, the former Crewe footballer, gave to the Guardian in November 2016, detailing the years of abuse he suffered in the club\u2019s youth system.</p> <p>As well as Gradi, Bowler, Palin and Hughes, Crewe\u2019s then assistant academy director, Terry McPhillips, now manager of Blackpool, and the then kit-man, John Fleet, state among hundreds of pages of evidence that they had never heard any rumour, innuendo or complaints relating to Bennell.</p> <p>Others at Crewe did have concerns, however. Many of Bennell\u2019s victims have stated there was persistent talk at Crewe about his relationship with the boys and the club\u2019s former managing director, Hamilton Smith, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/25/crewe-barry-bennell-former-board-member\" title=\"\">alleged he tried to warn his boardroom colleagues</a> after receiving a complaint. Ken Barnes, formerly Manchester City\u2019s chief scout, told the 1997 Dispatches documentary Soccer\u2019s Foul Play that Bowler\u2019s predecessor, Norman Rowlinson, had rung him on one occasion because Crewe \u201chad one or two reports of him [Bennell] mucking about with kids\u201d. Gradi, whose association with Crewe goes back to 1983, including 24 years and more than 1,200 games as manager, says in his evidence he can remember only one of Bennell\u2019s players leaving Crewe in \u201codd circumstances\u201d and defends the club\u2019s policy to let boys stay overnight with their coaches.</p> <p>As well as his usual salary, Bennell was paid an extra \u00a35 a night per boy in expenses to accommodate them, with up to 12 youngsters sleeping at a house he had turned into a \u201cchildren\u2019s paradise\u201d. Bennell would show them horror films and had arcade machines, a pool table, a juke box, a monkey, two Pyrenean dogs, an Alsatian named after Zico and even a puma he had bought from Poole zoo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0fde68d215e464f8e62f2179b79e28f404a2c37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0fde68d215e464f8e62f2179b79e28f404a2c37/0_123_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dario Gradi has been suspended by the Football Association since December 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dario Gradi has been suspended by the Football Association since December 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Focus Images Ltd/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe simple fact that Bennell had boys staying with him was not out of ordinary for this club,\u201d Gradi writes. \u201cI had (and still have on occasions) boys staying with me and indeed all my coaches have boys staying with them from time to time. One has to appreciate the nature of this club. We do not have endless resources and our boys are often brought through the ranks and stay with the club out of personal loyalty.\u201d</p> <p>As one example, Gradi referenced one youth-team player, who later played for Liverpool and England, who would stay at his own house at weekends and \u201cstayed with Crewe for many years\u201d despite other clubs trying to tempt him away. The player in question is understood to be Danny Murphy, who joined Crewe on schoolboy terms and eventually moved to Liverpool, aged 20, for \u00a31.5m. Crewe no longer operate this practice, in line with modern safeguarding rules.</p> <p>\u201cIt has served us well over the years if myself and my coaches build up a rapport with players,\u201d Gradi writes. \u201cI recently heard a story that one of my player\u2019s mothers had been approached by the chief scout of a leading Premiership side, based in London, who stated that her son would be better looked after if he went [there]. The boy\u2019s mother queried whether or not the manager would be cooking his tea on a Friday and Saturday night and personally bringing him home on a Sunday? When the answer was in the negative the mother thanked the scout for his interest but stated that her son would be staying with Crewe.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cI have a pool table and table football at home but no video games and no special [children\u2019s] bathrobes. I have no horror films and personally can\u2019t stand horror films. I have certainly never watched television with my arms around any boys.\u201d</p> <p>Palin would not let her own son train with Bennell, according to evidence from one witness to the FA\u2019s ongoing inquiry, and makes it clear in a statement from November 2003 that she was uncomfortable in his presence. \u201cI have to say that at the time I did not like him. I cannot put my finger upon what it was that caused me to dislike him. He was just one of those people who, on occasions, one takes an instantaneous dislike to.\u201d</p> <p>Gradi, however, was such an admirer of Bennell he supplied a character reference on behalf of his former colleague when the man he appointed in 1985 was arrested during a tour with the Stone Dominoes youth team to Florida nine years later. Gradi\u2019s initial information was that the rape allegation was \u201csour grapes\u201d from a disgruntled player.</p> <p>\u201cThe first time I believed the allegations was when I went to the local Spa and bumped into the mother of another boy who had been with us. His friend, who had come to us from Manchester City, had apparently told his parents about Bennell, but no complaint had ever been made to either me or this club.\u201d He adds: \u201cUntil this case came along I was fairly confident that I knew everything that was going on around the club.\u201d</p> <p>The only complaint about Bennell, according to Gradi, related to the coach\u2019s \u201cauthoritarian streak\u201d and one occasion when the youth team were made to \u201cwalk home from the countryside after a poor game\u201d. Bowler refers to the same incident, believed to relate to a match at Manchester United when Bennell dropped off a minibus of teenagers at Beeston Castle, 15 miles from Crewe, pointed them in the wrong direction and told them to find their own way back. Several hitch-hiked.</p> <p>\u201cI seem to recall there had been a complaint from a father of one of these boys,\u201d Bowler writes. \u201cI spoke to Dario Gradi about it and Barry Bennell was, to the best of my recollection, reprimanded.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I gleaned that Barry Bennell was a well-respected coach in the Manchester area and that was good enough for me</p> <footer> <cite>Dario Gradi</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bowler, who has been on the board since 1979, adds: \u201cI would prefer to be able to produce written documentation confirming this [reprimand] was the case but the simple fact of the matter is that we are talking about the mid-1980s to early-1990s and the reality is the documented procedures that are now in place for the protection of minors were not in place at that time.</p> <p>\u201cI do not believe there was the same amount of awareness of the dangers posed by sexual predators such as Barry Bennell.

      "bodyText": "Evidence supplied by Dario Gradi related to the Barry Bennell scandal can be revealed by the Guardian and includes an admission that he encouraged the culture at Crewe Alexandra for coaches to invite boys to stay overnight, or even take them on holidays abroad, and that he did not make detailed background checks on the man who has been described as one of the most persistent paedophiles in British criminal history. Gradi, suspended by the Football Association since December 2016, states that he never had any suspicions about his youth-team coach during seven years as colleagues and indicates that one of the reasons why Crewe did not seek a reference from Manchester City, Bennell\u2019s previous club, was because they were trying to poach him on the quiet. Bennell\u2019s behaviour at City had led to at least one complaint, as well as attracting concern all the way up to boardroom level, but Crewe apparently took the strategic decision not to ask. \u201cBennell had a talent for recruiting and keeping good-quality players,\u201d Gradi writes. \u201cNo references were checked with Manchester City, who I cannot imagine would have been particularly enamoured at the prospect of me poaching one of their sources of youth-team players.\u201d In a nine-page statement Gradi admits that when the first allegations about Bennell surfaced he, as manager, sided with the man who is now serving a 30-year prison sentence for raping and molesting boys from the junior set-ups of both clubs. He also states that Bennell\u2019s sudden departure from Crewe in 1992 had nothing to do with the relationship between his coach and the boys in his team. \u201cI have only ever sacked one person at Crewe and that was Barry Bennell,\u201d Gradi writes. \u201cI ultimately sacked him for failing to accept specific instructions regarding a coaching session on the pitch before a game.\u201d Gradi does not elaborate on what the instructions were, or seem certain about which game it was, adding that it was \u201cagainst Liverpool, I think\u201d. Legal documents seen by the Guardian from a previously unreported 2004 civil hearing reveal that Crewe had destroyed all their files relating to Bennell. \u201cThere are no records available,\u201d states the secretary, Gill Palin, one of the key figures in the Football Association\u2019s ongoing independent inquiry. \u201cIt was my standard practice in those days only to keep documents for a couple of years after a person had left the club. They would then be destroyed to make space.\u201d Malcolm Hughes, then the club\u2019s educational welfare officer, admits in a two-page statement that \u201csome of Barry Bennell\u2019s actions could have raised suspicions\u201d and the chairman, John Bowler, acknowledges that Crewe did not fully appreciate the dangers of football being used as a means for a paedophile to prey on young boys. As an insight into how calculating and devious Bennell was, it transpires he was personally responsible for the appointment of Hughes \u2013 almost certainly a ploy by Bennell to make it look as though he and Crewe regarded the welfare of the children as a priority. Yet Hughes makes the candid admission that in his early years at Crewe he had only a limited understanding of safeguarding issues. \u201cI certainly did not have the level of awareness that I currently have about the opportunities and potential for child sexual abuse and a need to monitor and check members of staff,\u201d he writes. Bennell was branded \u201cthe devil incarnate\u201d and \u201csheer evil\u201d by a judge after being convicted last year of 50 specimen charges relating to 12 boys from the junior systems of Crewe and Manchester City from 1979 to 1991. It was his fourth prison sentence in the past 25 years and, as the Guardian revealed in September, the man who was described in court as an \u201cindustrial-scale child molester\u201d is also facing the possibility of another criminal trial involving nine more complainants alleging child rape. As of January last year, at least 97 people \u2013 though the number is now thought to be beyond 100 \u2013 had reported Bennell on the back of the interview Andy Woodward, the former Crewe footballer, gave to the Guardian in November 2016, detailing the years of abuse he suffered in the club\u2019s youth system. As well as Gradi, Bowler, Palin and Hughes, Crewe\u2019s then assistant academy director, Terry McPhillips, now manager of Blackpool, and the then kit-man, John Fleet, state among hundreds of pages of evidence that they had never heard any rumour, innuendo or complaints relating to Bennell. Others at Crewe did have concerns, however. Many of Bennell\u2019s victims have stated there was persistent talk at Crewe about his relationship with the boys and the club\u2019s former managing director, Hamilton Smith, has alleged he tried to warn his boardroom colleagues after receiving a complaint. Ken Barnes, formerly Manchester City\u2019s chief scout, told the 1997 Dispatches documentary Soccer\u2019s Foul Play that Bowler\u2019s predecessor, Norman Rowlinson, had rung him on one occasion because Crewe \u201chad one or two reports of him [Bennell] mucking about with kids\u201d. Gradi, whose association with Crewe goes back to 1983, including 24 years and more than 1,200 games as manager, says in his evidence he can remember only one of Bennell\u2019s players leaving Crewe in \u201codd circumstances\u201d and defends the club\u2019s policy to let boys stay overnight with their coaches. As well as his usual salary, Bennell was paid an extra \u00a35 a night per boy in expenses to accommodate them, with up to 12 youngsters sleeping at a house he had turned into a \u201cchildren\u2019s paradise\u201d. Bennell would show them horror films and had arcade machines, a pool table, a juke box, a monkey, two Pyrenean dogs, an Alsatian named after Zico and even a puma he had bought from Poole zoo. \u201cThe simple fact that Bennell had boys staying with him was not out of ordinary for this club,\u201d Gradi writes. \u201cI had (and still have on occasions) boys staying with me and indeed all my coaches have boys staying with them from time to time. One has to appreciate the nature of this club. We do not have endless resources and our boys are often brought through the ranks and stay with the club out of personal loyalty.\u201d As one example, Gradi referenced one youth-team player, who later played for Liverpool and England, who would stay at his own house at weekends and \u201cstayed with Crewe for many years\u201d despite other clubs trying to tempt him away. The player in question is understood to be Danny Murphy, who joined Crewe on schoolboy terms and eventually moved to Liverpool, aged 20, for \u00a31.5m. Crewe no longer operate this practice, in line with modern safeguarding rules. \u201cIt has served us well over the years if myself and my coaches build up a rapport with players,\u201d Gradi writes. \u201cI recently heard a story that one of my player\u2019s mothers had been approached by the chief scout of a leading Premiership side, based in London, who stated that her son would be better looked after if he went [there]. The boy\u2019s mother queried whether or not the manager would be cooking his tea on a Friday and Saturday night and personally bringing him home on a Sunday? When the answer was in the negative the mother thanked the scout for his interest but stated that her son would be staying with Crewe.\u201d He adds: \u201cI have a pool table and table football at home but no video games and no special [children\u2019s] bathrobes.

Though the driver (Tony Vallelonga, played by Viggo Mortensen) is a former bouncer, and the passenger (Don Shirley, played by Ali) a concert pianist, it\u2019s Mortensen who is centre-stage, and received a nomination for best actor. Though Ali did win an Oscar, it was in the supporting actor category. The movie is written by Vallelonga\u2019s real-life son and the award was accepted on stage by its white-dominated producers.</p> <p>The movie, set in the early 1960s, much of it in the racially segregated southern states, fits almost perfectly into the Hollywood template. That is, black movies should be set a long time in the past, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/12/lost-plot-race-hollywood\" title=\"\">when things were really bad for black folk</a>, so the audience can leave with a nice warm feeling: \u201cHaven\u2019t we come a long way? Aren\u2019t we doing so well today?\u201d</p> <p>Their enduring message is that racism is all about bigots who beat up black people and shout \u201cnigger\u201d. Everyone who doesn\u2019t do that is some kind of woke hero. There\u2019s never any lesson for modern audiences on how they may be perpetuating racism, or be blind to its subtleties. For Green Book read: Selma, Fences, Loving. Even the more enlightened movies (Moonlight, If Beale Street Could Talk) can leave the audience feeling, \u201cGee, it must be miserable being black!\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s why it was so great to see Peele\u2019s Get Out break the mould in 2017 (the white girlfriend\u2019s creepy white friends all told the central black character, \u201cYou know, I voted for Obama\u201d). Building on this, last year\u2019s standout movie was Black Panther. Its celebration of black culture, and African-ness, has catapulted the spirit of Wakanda through the black diaspora.</p> <p>Above all, what makes Green Book such a bad choice is that it\u2019s a full 30 years since its road trip predecessor, Driving Miss Daisy, scooped the best picture Oscar. That similarly saccharine take on racism \u2013 this time using a white passenger and black driver \u2013 at least had the excuse that the world was far more ignorant then. Does Hollywood really consider a crude re-run the best it can do? It sends a message that, three decades on, it has learned nothing.</p> <p>\u2022 Joseph Harker is a deputy Opinion editor</p>",

Though the driver (Tony Vallelonga, played by Viggo Mortensen) is a former bouncer, and the passenger (Don Shirley, played by Ali) a concert pianist, it\u2019s Mortensen who is centre-stage, and received a nomination for best actor. Though Ali did win an Oscar, it was in the supporting actor category. The movie is written by Vallelonga\u2019s real-life son and the award was accepted on stage by its white-dominated producers. The movie, set in the early 1960s, much of it in the racially segregated southern states, fits almost perfectly into the Hollywood template. That is, black movies should be set a long time in the past, when things were really bad for black folk, so the audience can leave with a nice warm feeling: \u201cHaven\u2019t we come a long way? Aren\u2019t we doing so well today?\u201d Their enduring message is that racism is all about bigots who beat up black people and shout \u201cnigger\u201d. Everyone who doesn\u2019t do that is some kind of woke hero. There\u2019s never any lesson for modern audiences on how they may be perpetuating racism, or be blind to its subtleties. For Green Book read: Selma, Fences, Loving. Even the more enlightened movies (Moonlight, If Beale Street Could Talk) can leave the audience feeling, \u201cGee, it must be miserable being black!\u201d That\u2019s why it was so great to see Peele\u2019s Get Out break the mould in 2017 (the white girlfriend\u2019s creepy white friends all told the central black character, \u201cYou know, I voted for Obama\u201d). Building on this, last year\u2019s standout movie was Black Panther. Its celebration of black culture, and African-ness, has catapulted the spirit of Wakanda through the black diaspora. Above all, what makes Green Book such a bad choice is that it\u2019s a full 30 years since its road trip predecessor, Driving Miss Daisy, scooped the best picture Oscar. That similarly saccharine take on racism \u2013 this time using a white passenger and black driver \u2013 at least had the excuse that the world was far more ignorant then. Does Hollywood really consider a crude re-run the best it can do? It sends a message that, three decades on, it has learned nothing. \u2022 Joseph Harker is a deputy Opinion editor",

      "bodyText": "A former staffer on Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign has filed a federal lawsuit against the president, claiming he kissed her without consent. Alva Johnson, the director of outreach and coalitions in Alabama in 2016, said in the federal lawsuit that Trump made the nonconsensual advance on 24 August 2016 in Tampa, Florida. Johnson said Trump \u201cgrasped her hand and did not let go\u201d and kissed her on the corner of her mouth as she turned slightly away when she saw his lips coming towards hers. \u201cThe forced and unwanted kiss was deeply offensive to Ms Johnson,\u201d the lawsuit says, adding that she suffered \u201cemotional distress, psychological trauma, humiliation, embarrassment, loss of dignity, invasion of privacy and other damages\u201d. The Washington Post, which first reported details of the lawsuit, quoted Johnson as saying: \u201cI immediately felt violated because I wasn\u2019t expecting it or wanting it. I can still see his lips coming straight for my face.\u201d In a statement to the newspaper, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders dismissed Johnson\u2019s allegation as \u201cabsurd on its face\u201d. Sanders said: \u201cThis never happened and is directly contradicted by multiple highly credible eye witness accounts.\u201d Johnson filed the lawsuit in Florida on Monday, seeking damages for emotional pain and suffering. The Post said the lawsuit \u201calso alleges the campaign discriminated against Johnson, who is black, by paying her less than her white male counterparts\u201d. A spokesman for the Trump campaign denied the claim. Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct by numerous women, claims which he denies. In October 2016, a month before election day, the Post reported on a video tape recorded behind the scenes of the Access Hollywood NBC TV show, in which Trump was heard to boast of how his fame allowed him to make aggressive approaches to women. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star they let you do it,\u201d Trump said in the recording, which was made in 2005. \u201cYou can do anything.\u201d Unaware that a microphone was on, Trump said of one woman: \u201cI did try and fuck her, she was married.\u201d He also told show host Billy Bush that when he met beautiful women, he felt entitled to \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d. At the time, Trump said: \u201cAnyone who knows me knows these words don\u2019t reflect who I am. I said it. I am wrong. I apologize.\u201d At the time of the alleged incident, Johnson\u2019s main job with the Trump campaign was to manage a fleet of recreational vehicles that served as traveling offices throughout Florida. According to the lawsuit, Trump visited one of these RVs in Tampa before a rally there, when the unwanted kiss took place. \u201cHe told her he knew she had been on the road for a long time and that she had been doing a great job. He also told Ms Johnson that he would not forget about her, and that he was going to take care of her,\u201d Johnson claims in the lawsuit. Among those who allegedly witnessed the incident was Pam Bondi, at the time Florida\u2019s attorney general and a Trump supporter. The lawsuit contends that Bondi \u201cglanced at Ms Johnson and smiled\u201d after the alleged unwanted kiss. Bondi did not immediately respond on Monday to an email seeking comment. Following Johnson\u2019s sexual misconduct allegations, Trump\u2019s defenders are likely to point to a recently sealed lawsuit involving the former campaign worker. The Post reported that in September 2018, three months after Johnson hired the Washington DC attorney Hassan Zavareei to handle the Trump case, Johnson \u201cmoved to seal a years-old court case in which two family members had briefly sought a temporary restraining order against her\u201d. The restraining order was brought against Johnson in 2006. According to the Post, Johnson\u2019s half-sister alleged that Johnson had been calling another sister\u2019s school and falsely claiming that the teenager was using drugs. The family members withdrew the petition three weeks later. Zavareei said: \u201cThese false allegations came in the context of a family dispute that was resolved amicably years ago. \u201cMs Johnson\u2019s family stands firmly behind her pursuit of justice against Donald Trump for the sexual assaults he has committed against Ms Johnson and so many other women over the course of decades.\u201d",

So, why can\u2019t the bowlers have personalised balls as well? All of them shall be submitted to the officials for checks and be with the umpire during the matches - but the players can chose which of them to bowl with during the match and shuffle between them throughout (there will be a limit of five)! As long as the ball is spherical, not hollow from inside, and meeting a logical standard when it comes to the shine, they should be allowed to use their own balls and have their own touches on it (shine, not overtly picked seams, and coatings assisting spinners). It will clear the air about ball tampering, obtaining reverse swing, and bringing back into prominence the finger spinners like the ones from yesteryears, while restoring the balance to the limited overs games we so desperately need in these times of savage hitting. What do you think?\u201d</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s certainly a novel idea, but wouldn\u2019t work, IMHO, because of two main factors. The degradation of the ball is such a sacred thing and there\u2019s no need to redress that in the interests of \u2018fairness\u2019 between bat and ball. There\u2019s no doubt that the batters have an advantage in the short forms of the game these days, but the last thing that cricket needs is another overhaul.

He\u2019s been poor for maybe the last 10 innings, but nobody doubts the man\u2019s talent, and he needs some time in the middle before the World Cup. </p> \n  <p>I would persevere and if you need to drop Hales into the team during the ODI series against Pakistan in a home series before the home World Cup, so be it. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-25T13:27:55.867Z\">at 1.27pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c73e996e4b00307e95aa19e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-25T13:13:11.601Z\">1.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The pitch looks like an absolute belter</strong>.

It\u2019s still raining and perhaps a little heavier than it has been for much of the day. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they called it in the next 20 minutes or so. An email! \u201cRe the list of good things, loved your list, especially the NHS, although I think you\u2019ve missed warm woollen mittens,\u201d writes William Hargreaves. I\u2019m more of a fingerless gloves man myself, the go-to hand accessories for the erstwhile football reporter. And just to emphasise that point about the National Health Service: I\u2019m fortunate enough to have had very little interaction with the NHS in my near 40 years but every time that I have \u2013 including earlier today actually \u2013 they\u2019ve been absolutely brilliant. It\u2019s a wonderful, wonderful thing full of wonderful, wonderful people, that those of us in the UK should cherish and protect. Nothing to do with cricket, obviously, but it\u2019s raining so I don\u2019t care. They did manage to get a game in in Mumbai earlier today, with England Women losing to their India counterparts by seven wickets. It\u2019s turning into a bit of a chastening series for Heather Knight\u2019s side. Just to update you on the weather out in Grenada \u2026 it\u2019s still raining. So it\u2019s beginning to look a little bleak \u2013 if we don\u2019t get play within the hour, we won\u2019t get play at all. Things That Are Good dept. Simon Longstaffe: \u201cJust got some tickets to see Doves at the Royal Albert Hall\u2026\u201d Brian Withington: \u201cIn no particular order: Abbey Road medley, reading Catch-22 at fifteen, buttered crumpet thins, The Detectorists, Wes Anderson directing (especially Rushmore), Jon Anderson singing on Awaken, Jimmy Anderson swinging the Ashes.\u201d Damian Walsh: \u201cRe. Feeling good. Am being driven towards Madrid and although the bumps in the road make this email difficult to type the setting sun glinting off the snow a 100 metres above us makes everything worthwhile.\u201d The covers remain on and it\u2019s still raining in St George\u2019s. The cut-off for play, Ian Ward tells us, is 7.02pm GMT so we\u2019ve got about an hour an a half to see some play otherwise we\u2019re scuppered. I know there has been a lot of time and effort ploughed into the creation of The Hundred but I reckon there\u2019s a genuine case for all limited overs cricket being replaced by competitive Sweet Carolining. 5.13pm GMT: The good news: Umpires say we\u2019ll start a 30-overs-a-side game at 5.35pm GMT. 5.14pm GMT: The immediate bad news: it begins raining again and the covers come back on. So it\u2019s as you were. Another Good Thing: the covers are coming off. Though they\u2019ve been hokey-cokeying for much of the day so let\u2019s not get our hopes up too much. Hello all. Well, this has been a bit rubbish hasn\u2019t it? No prospect of any play for at least half an hour. Best case scenario is a game of 25-or-so overs a side I reckon. So to balance out the bad here are some things that are good: Tea (both cups of and the meal) Those early Wallace and Gromit animations before it all got a bit much Late Super Furry Animals Early REM Chips Train journeys where you get a table for four all to yourself. The NHS Feel free to send me yours and let\u2019s see if we can lift the mood. Not a ball has been bowled, but hope remains for some play in Grenada. John Ashdown is here to guide you through the rest of the day. Thanks for all your emails and tweets. Enjoy! 12.30pm GMT has come and gone and the promised update is that there is no update. It\u2019s still raining and shows no sign of abating. \u201cAlthough there\u2019s no cricket at present, Grenada does feature one of the best webcam views in the world courtesy of Phil and Helen at Dive Grenada (I\u2019ve been there four times and they are nice enough to deserve the view!). Try the link. Hoping for play later but doesn\u2019t look too promising to me.\u201d That\u2019s from Jeff Chapman. That webcam link has had over 1.6m views and is loosely helpful for showing the state of the skies. Just had to pull the blinds down at Guardian HQ in London, because THE SUN IS TOO BRIGHT. The world is a cruel place, sometimes. Not at this rate, he isn\u2019t. A fabulous performance from India\u2019s women has seen them thrash England earlier today. India have won the ODI series and can complete a whitewash on Thursday in the final match. Update on today\u2019s play: the covers have come off and gone back on again. We\u2019ll have an update from officials at the ground at 4.30pm GMT, which is 12.30pm local time. A couple more suggestions \u2026 \u201cThe best celebration has to be Phil Edmonds,\u201d emails Dave Brown. \u201cIf I remember correctly it was one of nonchalant indifference.\u201d \u201cHas to be Freddie Flintoff\u2019s down on one knee arms spread, or the alternate standing arms spread both in 2009,\u201d emails Darren Howells. \u201cClassic and indulgent.\u201d \u201cI quite like the Merv Hughes full on lick of the cricket ball,\u201d emails Chris Moore. \u201cCan\u2019t remember who was on at the other end, but they may have wished for a sanitiser spray.\u201d That, and more, is nicely covered in this fine article. It also has some fine info below the line, although I can\u2019t say for sure how much of it is true. Good fun, though. Jack Russell\u2019s multiply-used teabag -- he dranks 20 cups a day too -- was the least of his eccentricities, which included wearing the same floppy hat, even though it was falling apart (he also would heat it in an oven, for what purposes I forget), blindfolding teammates before driving them to his house (because he didn\u2019t want them to know where he lived) -- he always drove wearing a sleeping bag with the bottom cut out too -- living off baked beans for an entire tour, requiring that his lunchtime wheetabix be soaked for exactly eight minutes, and self-flagellation if he\u2019d had a bad day behind the stumps. The covers are coming off \u2026 the covers are going back on. More action than a laundromat in Grenada, but we\u2019re no closer to seeing any cricket. Soz. Complete with \u2018Man-genta\u2019 gag over Lee\u2019s pink shirt. As we\u2019re on the subject of Cottrell, what is your favourite signature move/celebration in cricket? Billy Bowden had a few, Imran Tahir just runs around (my colleague Nick Miller refers to him as the Filippo Inzaghi of cricket) and then there\u2019s the Brett Lee lawnmower. What are your favourites, and why? Email me, tweet me. Please. michael.butler@theguardian.com or @michaelbutler18. Will be interesting to see how England combat Cottrell today. The left-arm quickie was unlucky not to be given man of the match in the second ODI after taking five wickets \u2013 owing to young Hetmyer\u2019s century \u2013 and he will be full of confidence going into today\u2019s play. Couple of interesting stats for England batsman since January 2017: their average to right-hand seamers is 39.95, but just 25.28 against the lefties. That is a significant difference, and much more than other sides, who tend to see a three-four run difference between right and left. It\u2019s not. The covers are back on. We will only have light in Grenada until 6pm local time (10pm GMT) because there aren\u2019t any floodlights at Queen\u2019s Park. I\u2019m sure that they will reduce the interval between the innings, but as this delay goes on, we will lose further overs. So play will start at 3.20pm, with each side playing 45 overs. Let\u2019s hope that\u2019s the last of the rain. GET READY FOR CRICKET GUYS. There\u2019s a bit of blue sky hovering on the horizon but the covers are still on in Grenada. If you want to kill some time, why not read this from Emma John? If you are a quick reader, or EXTREMELY idle at work, have a bang on this. \u201cAfternoon Michael,\u201d writes Brian Withington. \u201cWelcome to the OBO. Can I gushingly share my man love for Rob Keys as a very welcome addition to the Sky team. I think he and Nasser are excellent individually and quite entertaining together. Long overdue time to pension off the Gower, Botham and Willis tribute act methinks.\u201d Have to agree with you Brian. And Tymal Mills was also very interesting to listen to in the Sky Studio, particularly talking about his run-up and the seam position. Gary Naylor, in defence of Bairstow. Fielding, or the lack of it, has been hugely influential in this series. West Indies have dropped seven chances to England\u2019s two, although that drop of Gayle on nine in the first ODI nearly proved very costly. \u201cGood afternoon Michael, and welcome,\u201d writes Ben Powell. \u201cDismayed to read that the line-ups are about to \u201cdrop\u201d (I\u2019ll hazard a guess that most OBOers aren\u2019t millennials). The only thing that drops around here is the once dependable Jos Buttler. Honk!\u201d And with that, here we are. I\u2019ve got some bad news. The covers are back on, which means we\u2019re going to start losing overs. \u201cHello Michael, I\u2019m not sure you should be debarring all doubt about Jonny Bairstow\u2019s talent,\u201d writes Geoff Wignall. \u201cThat he has talent is obvious but I\u2019d certainly question whether it\u2019s equal to his reputation. The weaknesses in his technique remain unaddressed in his thirtieth year. I suspect his ability is very much in line with his record - good but not great and in recent times generally quite moderate.\u201d It will be interesting to see how England adapt to losing Stokes from their bowling attack. Just five out-and-out bowlers in the side, so do not be surprised to see Root taking a few middle overs alongside Plunkett. It seems like a smart play with the moisture in the air and on the track. Morgan also confirms that Alex Hales is going to come in at No 3 in place of Ben Stokes, who rolled his ankle yesterday in training. He insists it\u2019s just a precaution, I wonder if that was another footy injury. The other change is a fit again Chris Woakes coming in for Tom Curran. Jason Holder says he would have done the same thing, but is still optimistic of victory. The West Indies are unchanged from the side that beat England on Friday. Abhijato Sensarma has sent in a proposal. \u201cI had an idea looking at the different bats smack the ball to all parts of the ground during the series so far.\u201d As long as the bats meet certain regulations, they can be personalised by the batsmen. So, why can\u2019t the bowlers have personalised balls as well? All of them shall be submitted to the officials for checks and be with the umpire during the matches - but the players can chose which of them to bowl with during the match and shuffle between them throughout (there will be a limit of five)! As long as the ball is spherical, not hollow from inside, and meeting a logical standard when it comes to the shine, they should be allowed to use their own balls and have their own touches on it (shine, not overtly picked seams, and coatings assisting spinners). It will clear the air about ball tampering, obtaining reverse swing, and bringing back into prominence the finger spinners like the ones from yesteryears, while restoring the balance to the limited overs games we so desperately need in these times of savage hitting. What do you think?\u201d It\u2019s certainly a novel idea, but wouldn\u2019t work, IMHO, because of two main factors. The degradation of the ball is such a sacred thing and there\u2019s no need to redress that in the interests of \u2018fairness\u2019 between bat and ball. There\u2019s no doubt that the batters have an advantage in the short forms of the game these days, but the last thing that cricket needs is another overhaul. The product is fine as it is. Bumble is out on the pitch and seems to think it will be a better wicket to bat on second. The covers have been on there all night and all morning and could be a bit more unpredictable for the first innings. The covers are coming off! Hopefully we\u2019ll have the toss and team news with you imminently. While we\u2019ve been waiting, Mark Wood has been describing \u2013 in that fine north-east lilt \u2013 how he has recently adjusted his run up to extend it by around about a third. For somebody that throws them down at 90mph+, the short run up was doing a lot of wear and tear to his body. He also revealed that the reason he originally had a short run up was because he used to zig-zag his way to the crease, and keeping it short was a way to minimise that. You can read Ali Martin\u2019s preview of today\u2019s game right here. There also some news on the West Indies side of things. Andre Russell won\u2019t be involved today, but will be available for the fourth and fifth ODIs. Andre Russell has been added to the West Indies squad for the last two matches of the one-day series against England. The 30-year-old played the last of 52 ODIs seven months ago but now has the chance to make a late push for World Cup selection. Russell, who has recently completed a stint in the Pakistan Super League, will be available for the fourth game in Grenada on Wednesday and the concluding fixture in St Lucia. Some news, courtesy of Press Association. Former South Africa international AB De Villiers has signed to play for Middlesex in this season\u2019s Vitality T20 Blast. De Villiers, who retired from all forms of international cricket last May, will be available for Middlesex\u2019s first seven T20 Blast matches and, if they qualify, could return for the latter stages of the competition. The 35-year-old averaged 50.66 from 114 Tests, added to a remarkable one-day international average of 53.50 from his 228 matches. De Villiers boasts the record for the fastest ODI century, from just 31 balls against West Indies in 2015. \u201cI have always wanted to play county cricket, and I am very much looking forward to joining Middlesex for the Vitality Blast, said De Villiers. \u201cPlaying at Lord\u2019s is always a wonderful privilege, and I\u2019m looking forward to the match at Richmond, a beautiful ground in south-west London. That will be a great experience.\u201d The South African\u2019s devastating domestic T20 strike rate of 148.85 will make him an exciting addition to a Middlesex squad who have struggled in the Blast. They finished bottom of the South Group last season and have named former West Indies coach Stuart Law as their head coach in all formats \u2013 meaning Daniel Vettori leaves his role at the helm of the T20 side. Our first email, from John Starbuck. \u201cMichael, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve done the OBO very often, so welcome from all us readers. If Hales plays, I suspect Jonny Bairstow will the be the one to luck out as not sufficiently disciplined for an opener, but you could say that of plenty of people in recent years.\u201d Thanks for the welcome John. I\u2019m not sure that Hales and discipline go hand in hand but yes, Bairstow is one of the names that could miss out here. I\u2019d like to see him continue in the side. He\u2019s been poor for maybe the last 10 innings, but nobody doubts the man\u2019s talent, and he needs some time in the middle before the World Cup. I would persevere and if you need to drop Hales into the team during the ODI series against Pakistan in a home series before the home World Cup, so be it. The pitch looks like an absolute belter. There\u2019s some grass on the surface, which was not the case in Barbados and should slow the pace a little here. The rain might slow the outfield, so I doubt if we\u2019ll see scores of 350/360. Looks like we\u2019re going to see a delay on the start time, it\u2019s spitting a little in Grenada\u2019s capital. Sky\u2019s Rob Key and Nick Knight are huddled under an umbrella on the outfield, speculating on the team news for England. They seem to think that Chris Woakes will play and are speculating that Alex Hales might be given a game today. Nothing confirmed though, we\u2019ll have the confirmed line-ups as soon as they drop. The irony of course being that in Grenada there are some light showers, although we\u2019re not sure if that will knock back the first ball. The covers are on and the toss has been delayed. Still these are the pictures from the nets session yesterday. Looks alright, doesn\u2019t it? These pictures also. From last night. As somebody that spent yesterday\u2019s glorious afternoon in London lying on the sofa watching Manchester United v Liverpool and the Carabao Cup final with the curtains drawn, I am counting this ODI as my outdoor time. I\u2019ve got suncream and a hat on and am ready to take any of your email and tweets: michael.butler@theguardian.com or @michaelbutler18. #content India\u2019s women thrashed England by seven wickets today in the second ODI to win the series and the hosts have a chance to complete a whitewash on Thursday. Ouch. The English don\u2019t wear the favourites tag particularly lightly. It\u2019s much better to be the chaser, the underdog, to expect little and then revel in genuine surprise and joy if anything comes of it. Just look at Olivia Coleman, her rise from Numberwang and being buried in a ball-pit by Mark to global acclaim is exactly the sort of feel-good story that 2019 needs. If only her husband could cry. Please cry, husband! The opening two lines of her Oscar acceptance speech was just about how every England cricket fan felt watching the second ODI on Friday. But whilst there were some poor performances for the best one-day side in the world, the overriding feeling was one of triumph for the West Indies. The atmosphere at the Kensington Oval in Barbados was electric, and few could argue that the Windies didn\u2019t deserve the win. The star of the show was Sheldon Cottrell and his 5-46 \u2013 his saluting celebration (a nod to his time as a private in the Jamaican Defence Force) and body-juddering joy a perfect mixture of choreographed timing and raw emotion and a good metaphor for the Windies\u2019 performance in general. If that was a raucous Friday night in Barbados, it is unlikely that we will see the same ambiance on a Monday morning in Grenada, but let\u2019s hope the cricket is as good. We\u2019ve got an earlier start time today on account of there being no floodlights at the Queen\u2019s Parkground. First ball at 1.30pm GMT or if you\u2019re lucky enough to be in Grenada: 9.30am.",

Beyond the nuts and bolts of the facts of life, these are issues that require well-informed and sensitive handling: sexual orientation, gender identity, self-harm, FGM and abuse are deeply personal and difficult subjects to tackle in a classroom. That said, it is good to see a Conservative government turning its face so strongly against the homophobia of the past, by promoting a diverse understanding of human sexuality; and a relief to see a cross-party consensus emerge in our divided parliament in support of a humane and progressive direction for education.",

This may be because they consider it to be some protection from the view that many of your readers would otherwise take when reading their assertions, but it is essentially irrelevant. The vast majority of the UK Jewish community has made its view of Mr Corbyn clear. So too has the public in various opinion polls. He is not trusted on antisemitism, first because he has not acted against it and because his own actions are, at least, concerning. Second, because those claiming to speak about antisemitism in his name do so without reproach or disassociation.</p> <p>The Labour party has, previously, been a force for good in promoting anti-racism, as the authors acknowledge. Sadly, that is no longer the case. It has never been the case, anywhere, that a party which could not root out antisemitism from its midst, tolerated those accusing Jews of manufacturing it, and lost the trust of the Jewish community, ever governed fairly, decently or competently. Antisemitism is corruption, and corruption spreads.</p> <p>We also disagree with the authors\u2019 apparent belief that the ability to criticise Israel is critical to the debate on antisemitism. The Labour party\u2019s adoption of the IHRA definition marks its acceptance of the fact that criticism of Israel must not involve antisemitism, and that there is a wide range of acceptable criticism that does not. The discredited argument that antisemitism is invented by Jews to protect Israel is antisemitic. So is criticism of Israel outside the IHRA guidelines and definition. Both of these things should be outwith the scope of mainstream, tolerant debate.</p> <p>Suggesting a permissible link between the Labour leadership\u2019s attitude to British Jews and Israel is both wrong and shameful. There is no basis to refuse to reproach or reject the antisemites we refer to above. The leadership\u2019s failure to do so makes Jews part of the \u201cfew\u201d, who the Labour party expressly reject.</p> <p>That Labour is so mistrusted on the issue is uncomfortable and sad. But it must be said. And in saying it, we do not speak as Jews, but as citizens of this country. Antisemitism is not a Jewish problem. It is a problem for Jews.<br><strong>Dr Scott Aaron</strong><br><strong>Benjy Aarons-Richardson</strong><br><strong>Stacey Abendstern</strong><br><strong>Celia Abery</strong><br><strong>Michael

      "bodyText": "We write in response to the letter you published on 21 February, asserting that Jeremy Corbyn was a crucial ally in the fight against bigotry and reaction and that a Labour government would be a powerful force against antisemitism. The signatories to that letter plainly feel the need to rely on their Judaism to bolster its content. This may be because they consider it to be some protection from the view that many of your readers would otherwise take when reading their assertions, but it is essentially irrelevant. The vast majority of the UK Jewish community has made its view of Mr Corbyn clear. So too has the public in various opinion polls. He is not trusted on antisemitism, first because he has not acted against it and because his own actions are, at least, concerning. Second, because those claiming to speak about antisemitism in his name do so without reproach or disassociation. The Labour party has, previously, been a force for good in promoting anti-racism, as the authors acknowledge. Sadly, that is no longer the case. It has never been the case, anywhere, that a party which could not root out antisemitism from its midst, tolerated those accusing Jews of manufacturing it, and lost the trust of the Jewish community, ever governed fairly, decently or competently. Antisemitism is corruption, and corruption spreads. We also disagree with the authors\u2019 apparent belief that the ability to criticise Israel is critical to the debate on antisemitism. The Labour party\u2019s adoption of the IHRA definition marks its acceptance of the fact that criticism of Israel must not involve antisemitism, and that there is a wide range of acceptable criticism that does not. The discredited argument that antisemitism is invented by Jews to protect Israel is antisemitic. So is criticism of Israel outside the IHRA guidelines and definition. Both of these things should be outwith the scope of mainstream, tolerant debate. Suggesting a permissible link between the Labour leadership\u2019s attitude to British Jews and Israel is both wrong and shameful. There is no basis to refuse to reproach or reject the antisemites we refer to above. The leadership\u2019s failure to do so makes Jews part of the \u201cfew\u201d, who the Labour party expressly reject. That Labour is so mistrusted on the issue is uncomfortable and sad. But it must be said. And in saying it, we do not speak as Jews, but as citizens of this country. Antisemitism is not a Jewish problem. It is a problem for Jews.

BSGR denied any wrongdoing and responded by filing <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/guinea-mining-simandou/bsgr-pushes-ahead-with-arbitration-against-guinea-over-simandou-mining-rights-idUSL5N0RB45320140910\">a notice of dispute</a> at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.</p> <p>On Monday, BSGR said it would drop its claim on Simandou after reaching an agreement with the Guinea government in which the two parties will withdraw outstanding actions related to the dispute. The agreement, if implemented, should remove one obstacle to the mine being developed and is expected also to allow investment in the separate Zogota iron ore deposit nearby, in which BSGR remains interested.</p> <p>In a statement, BSGR said: \u201cFollowing this agreement, BSGR relinquishes its claims on blocks 1 and 2 of Simandou and both parties waive all outstanding procedures.\u201d</p> <p>Steinmetz and BSGR have attracted their fair share of controversy over the past five years.

      "bodyText": "The mining group controlled by the controversial tycoon Beny Steinmetz is to walk away from a massive iron ore project in Guinea as part of an agreement that settles a long-running corruption dispute with the west African nation. Development of Simandou \u2013 one of the world\u2019s biggest iron deposits, containing billions of tonnes of high-grade ore \u2013 has been hindered by years of legal wrangling as well as the enormous cost of the required infrastructure, estimated at more than $20bn (\u00a315bn). Guinea had levelled corruption allegations at Steinmetz\u2019s BSG Resources (BSGR) and stripped the company of its rights to the Simandou blocks and the smaller Zogota concession. BSGR denied any wrongdoing and responded by filing a notice of dispute at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. On Monday, BSGR said it would drop its claim on Simandou after reaching an agreement with the Guinea government in which the two parties will withdraw outstanding actions related to the dispute. The agreement, if implemented, should remove one obstacle to the mine being developed and is expected also to allow investment in the separate Zogota iron ore deposit nearby, in which BSGR remains interested. In a statement, BSGR said: \u201cFollowing this agreement, BSGR relinquishes its claims on blocks 1 and 2 of Simandou and both parties waive all outstanding procedures.\u201d Steinmetz and BSGR have attracted their fair share of controversy over the past five years. Having seen BSGR stripped of its Guinea mining rights is 2014, Steinmetz was arrested in his home country of Israel in 2016 over claims that he arranged for bribes to be paid to gain access to Simandou. Steinmetz has denied any wrongdoing. A company spokesman said he did not know if the Israel investigation is ongoing. BSGR, which voluntarily entered administration last year to protect itself from legal disputes related to a project in Guinea, also indicated that it hopes to be involved in efforts by new investors to develop the Zogota iron ore deposit in the near future. It refused to comment on whether any future involvement at the Zogota site was part of the settlement agreement or if the company would now come out of administration. Rival mining firms are also showing an interest in investing in Zogota, possibly as part of a deal involving BSGR. One of them is Niron Metals, which is headed by Sir Mick Davis, chief executive of the Conservative party and the former boss of the mining group Xstrata. A spokesman for Niron said: \u201cThe announcement [that Guinea and BSRG have agreed to settle their legal claims] has paved the way for the creation of an effective mining partnership between Niron and the government to mine this deposit. The company looks forward to bringing this to fruition subject the satisfactory settlement of all disputes between the parties.\u201d Guinea\u2019s mines minister, Abdoulaye Magassouba, told Reuters: \u201cWe are pleased there\u2019s been an amicable resolution of the dispute with BSGR, particularly since Guinea will recuperate the world-class deposit of Simandou\u2019s blocks 1 and 2.\u201d",

With other innovative gallerists such as Henry Rothschild and Pan Henry, he had an instinct for the handmade and how it could enrich life. His gallery, which from 1966 was in Meer Street, then from 1983 in Chapel Street, showed pots along with wood, glass, weaving and pictures. The displays, put together by Peter\u2019s partner, Guido Marchini, a textile designer, were memorably elegant, so much so that the potter Lucie Rie said she had never seen her work look as good as it did in her exhibition at the gallery in 1983.

Dean has been redirected from fourth official duties in Tottenham\u2019s game at Chelsea on Wednesday to avoid potential for further conflict with the Spurs manager.

      "body": "<p>In the video that went viral in October last year, Ayishat Akanbi sits in a sunny park, dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and plastic-rimmed glasses with her dreadlocks piled on her head. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DoubleDownNews/videos/283034889216494/\">The problem with wokeness</a>, she explains, is that social justice awareness can turn into \u201coppression Olympics\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s a daring topic. As Akanbi tells Guardian Australia ahead of her appearance at <a href=\"https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/all-about-women\">All About Women</a>: \u201cWith wokeness we\u2019re speaking from a place of emotion, which is why things can get as drastic and dramatic as they do.\u201d And yet, respect has amassed around Akanbi precisely because of her rational approach and unfazed cool. Backlash? What backlash?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/24/ade-samuel-at-the-start-of-my-career-i-received-lots-of-nos\">Ade Samuel: 'At the start of my career, I received lots of nos'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A personal audience with Akanbi can be used to one\u2019s advantage. Despite using Twitter as her daily mouthpiece, the London-based cultural commentator, celebrity stylist and DJ has never put a foot wrong online, not unless she\u2019s secretly hired one of those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/21/internet-shaming-lindsey-stone-jon-ronson\">digital management reputation</a> companies that make Google results disappear. So when interviewing her, honing in on her thoughts about how to maintain integrity in the age of self-promotion should surely be the priority.</p> <p>Akanbi laughs modestly at this. \u201cI think of social media like a stage,\u201d she offers. \u201cIf I had the audience of 20 people, what would I want to say? That\u2019s what informs me about what I share online. I tend to think that if things resonate with people, then they will find it. I\u2019m very scared of having things that exist in the world that I can\u2019t stand behind.\u201d</p> <p>Early on in life, Akanbi realised she was interested in psychology, specifically the psychology of clothing and how it can influence public perception. She grew up in the English town of Southampton, to a Nigerian Muslim mother who struggled to understand the way her daughter played with her look.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8de7f029474c17300103717a3b0ad287a89f91fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8de7f029474c17300103717a3b0ad287a89f91fd/365_724_4887_6103/801.jpg\" alt=\"Celebrity stylist, DJ and cultural commentator Ayishat Akanbi\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I often find people want to mediate what I said, or they want it to fit a certain agenda.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vicky Grout/Sydney Opera House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI never really understood the mainstream concepts of what it meant to be a woman,\u201d Akanbi says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ever traditionally feminine and you couldn\u2019t necessarily box it into: \u2018Oh, she\u2019s a tomboy.\u2019 I just wasn\u2019t in the race, you know? I always had a somewhat more eccentric style, and I noticed that it made a world of different types of people have an interest in me \u2013 the types that I wouldn\u2019t necessarily imagine would have an interest.\u201d</p> <p>When Akanbi moved into styling, she wanted to give others that opportunity, particularly black urban artists who she felt were being overlooked. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s something about my look that was inviting, or not intimidating. That\u2019s what I wanted to try out with other people, to see how much of it is about skin colour or some form of \u2018ism\u2019, and how much of it is about people needing signifiers that make them feel comfortable.\u201d</p> <p>Since 2010, Akanbi has forged a career around the intersection of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/individualism/\">style and social ideology</a>. She\u2019s styled some of the biggest names on the British urban music scene, including Labrinth and Dizzee Rascal, and has worked on campaigns for Nike, Reebok and Adidas as well as collaborating with the Tate Modern, the Design Museum, the Barbican and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum.</p> <p>Her opinions have made her a popular pundit on mainstream news programs, but she prefers to control the narrative via broadcasting on the internet, which she calls \u201cthe people\u2019s revolution\u201d. She\u2019s had her own web show \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgeJP73oUKE&amp;t=11s\">All About Ayishat</a> \u2013 and has debated issues with other bright young things on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeHFpaLCk30&amp;t=987s\">Subjectivity TV</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI often find people want to mediate what I said, or they want it to fit a certain agenda, so using the internet is a way of taking some ownership of how I\u2019m perceived,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat happens is, if I have a comment around women that highlights, maybe, some of their subjugation, then people think I have their brand of feminism. And then, sometimes, I might critique women for things that I perceive to be unhelpful. And then people are quick to say, \u2018Oh, are you an anti-feminist?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She laughs. \u201cI do tell Twitter quite often that I\u2019m a problematic person. And to be fair, my problematic ideas are my favourite ones. Because they feel the most genuine.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BuLhHuiF6Ro/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "In the video that went viral in October last year, Ayishat Akanbi sits in a sunny park, dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and plastic-rimmed glasses with her dreadlocks piled on her head. The problem with wokeness, she explains, is that social justice awareness can turn into \u201coppression Olympics\u201d. It\u2019s a daring topic. As Akanbi tells Guardian Australia ahead of her appearance at All About Women: \u201cWith wokeness we\u2019re speaking from a place of emotion, which is why things can get as drastic and dramatic as they do.\u201d And yet, respect has amassed around Akanbi precisely because of her rational approach and unfazed cool. Backlash? What backlash? A personal audience with Akanbi can be used to one\u2019s advantage. Despite using Twitter as her daily mouthpiece, the London-based cultural commentator, celebrity stylist and DJ has never put a foot wrong online, not unless she\u2019s secretly hired one of those digital management reputation companies that make Google results disappear. So when interviewing her, honing in on her thoughts about how to maintain integrity in the age of self-promotion should surely be the priority. Akanbi laughs modestly at this. \u201cI think of social media like a stage,\u201d she offers. \u201cIf I had the audience of 20 people, what would I want to say? That\u2019s what informs me about what I share online. I tend to think that if things resonate with people, then they will find it. I\u2019m very scared of having things that exist in the world that I can\u2019t stand behind.\u201d Early on in life, Akanbi realised she was interested in psychology, specifically the psychology of clothing and how it can influence public perception. She grew up in the English town of Southampton, to a Nigerian Muslim mother who struggled to understand the way her daughter played with her look. \u201cI never really understood the mainstream concepts of what it meant to be a woman,\u201d Akanbi says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ever traditionally feminine and you couldn\u2019t necessarily box it into: \u2018Oh, she\u2019s a tomboy.\u2019 I just wasn\u2019t in the race, you know? I always had a somewhat more eccentric style, and I noticed that it made a world of different types of people have an interest in me \u2013 the types that I wouldn\u2019t necessarily imagine would have an interest.\u201d When Akanbi moved into styling, she wanted to give others that opportunity, particularly black urban artists who she felt were being overlooked. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s something about my look that was inviting, or not intimidating. That\u2019s what I wanted to try out with other people, to see how much of it is about skin colour or some form of \u2018ism\u2019, and how much of it is about people needing signifiers that make them feel comfortable.\u201d Since 2010, Akanbi has forged a career around the intersection of style and social ideology. She\u2019s styled some of the biggest names on the British urban music scene, including Labrinth and Dizzee Rascal, and has worked on campaigns for Nike, Reebok and Adidas as well as collaborating with the Tate Modern, the Design Museum, the Barbican and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. Her opinions have made her a popular pundit on mainstream news programs, but she prefers to control the narrative via broadcasting on the internet, which she calls \u201cthe people\u2019s revolution\u201d. She\u2019s had her own web show \u2013 All About Ayishat \u2013 and has debated issues with other bright young things on Subjectivity TV. \u201cI often find people want to mediate what I said, or they want it to fit a certain agenda, so using the internet is a way of taking some ownership of how I\u2019m perceived,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat happens is, if I have a comment around women that highlights, maybe, some of their subjugation, then people think I have their brand of feminism. And then, sometimes, I might critique women for things that I perceive to be unhelpful. And then people are quick to say, \u2018Oh, are you an anti-feminist?\u2019\u201d She laughs. \u201cI do tell Twitter quite often that I\u2019m a problematic person. And to be fair, my problematic ideas are my favourite ones. Because they feel the most genuine.\u201d Now 30, Akanbi was born at the dawn of the internet, which marked the death of the fashion tribes that once flourished in London \u2013 buffalo, goth, new romantic and rude boys/girls among them. In 2019, fashion trends are immediate and global. She sees the same looks on dance floors in Nigeria and London. This breaking-down of cultural borders leads to cries of cultural appropriation, which is something she avoids weighing in on. \u201cIt\u2019s potentially something you can claim when, let\u2019s say, a designer was to make some form of Ghanaian-style dress and then says that they started that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut when we go back in history, so much was shared by so many different cultures, such as dreadlocks.\u201d The media, she says, has inherent biases about non-western cultures, which are then internalised by people from those cultures. \u201cNow the tables seem to have been turned and there are a lot more white people who are clearly seeing that there isn\u2019t only one way to be beautiful. I can\u2019t not see the good in that. So a white girl with braids doesn\u2019t offend me.\u201d Akanbi is now working on a book to give her online ideas some breathing space, but she\u2019ll always be a stylist.

In the build-up to the 2019 NRL campaign, that hurt has been inflicted by a group of players who clearly believed they operated outside the bounds of what is deemed tolerable by society and the game. The damage has also been done by an administration that has for far too long resorted to cheap rhetoric over real action and clubs that have, for the most part, palmed responsibility for their players off to the league. The result is a situation where St George Illawarra player Jack de Belin, accused of aggravated sexual assault, has not stood down or been stood down by either his club or the league with those charges pending. It is a position few view as acceptable. The day of reckoning that has long been coming to an administration more focused on populism than policy has finally arrived, and the ARLC is reportedly set to review its disciplinary policy regarding players charged with serious crimes against women this week. Rugby league, of course, should stand against violence against women \u2013 it should stand against violence full-stop \u2013 but taking such a position before judicial proceedings are completed can be problematic, given the acceptance that a person is innocent until proven guilty. The moral justification for passing new guidelines to allow a player facing these kind of serious charges to be stood down are clear, but there are reputational reasons to consider too. The NRL should not and cannot put up with this behaviour. It is the right and proper thing to stand down a player accused of serious criminal behaviour. The league should also be protecting its own reputation. The two go hand-in-hand and can no longer be separated. As such, the NRL needs to be clear with its public messaging at this point. The moral stance can be underscored when investigations are complete, trials are finalised, and verdicts are reached.

      "bodyText": "Labor remains ahead of the Coalition in the latest Guardian Essential poll, which suggests voters like social spending more than they like tax concessions, but points to mixed views on the medical evacuations bill. The new survey, which puts Labor in front of the Coalition on the two-party-preferred measure 52% to 48%, comes as Scott Morrison will confirm on Tuesday his government will greenlight a commitment of up to $1.38bn for the long-mooted expansion of the Snowy Hydro scheme as part of the government\u2019s attempted climate change pivot. While Malcolm Turnbull had telegraphed spending of $2bn for his pet project, adding 2,000MW of new generation capacity, Morrison will pledge up to $1.38bn in an equity investment, with the remainder of the project to be financed by Snowy Hydro Limited. A feasibility study for the project in 2017 predicted the total cost could be up to $4.5bn. \u201cSnowy 2.0 will inject the energy supply and reliability of our electricity market needs, helping cut costs to families and businesses and cut Australia\u2019s emissions,\u201d Morrison said ahead of Tuesday\u2019s announcement. With the prime minister focusing on climate, Labor will press ahead on Tuesday with its rolling response to the Hayne royal commission into the banks, allocating $120m from its proposed banking \u201cfairness\u201d fund to boost the number of financial rights lawyers from 40 to 240 across Australia. The new poll of 1,085 respondents puts the Coalition\u2019s primary vote on 38% and Labor\u2019s on 37%, with the Greens on 9%, Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation on 6% and support for \u201cothers\u201d and independents on 10%. The latest two-party-preferred result, which is consistent with this week\u2019s Newspoll, suggests a tightening in the political contest between the major parties. The Guardian Essential survey a fortnight ago, which followed the final report of the banking royal commission, put Labor ahead of the government 55% to 45%. A month ago, the two-party-preferred result was the same as this fortnight. With the Coalition sharpening its negative campaigning on Labor\u2019s tax measures and on border protection as the election draws closer, voters were asked a number of questions about tax policy and about the medical evacuations bill passed during the parliamentary last sitting. The largest group in the survey, 38%, said the medical evacuations bill struck the right balance between strong borders and humane treatment, while 15% said it did not go far enough to protect people in offshore detention, and 30% felt it would weaken Australia\u2019s borders. The sample split again over whether the passage of the bill would influence their vote at the coming election. Just over a quarter of the group said it would, with this cohort predominantly \u201cother\u201d voters (36%), Liberal/National voters (32%) and men (30%). In this group, 57% were of the view that the new protocols weakened Australia\u2019s borders, and 19% felt the procedures did not protect the wellbeing of people in offshore detention sufficiently. Another chunk of the sample, 35%, reported the package would have a moderate influence at the election, including 18-34 year olds (47%), women (38%), and Greens voters (38%). Thirty eight per cent said the issue would have no influence on their vote, with those most likely to say this being voters aged over 55 (44%), Labor voters (42%) and those aged 35-54 (40%). On tax, over half of the sample (53%) were more likely to support closing off loopholes and concessions and directing the revenue towards funding for schools, hospitals and other social programs. That principle had majority support among men, women and most age groups except for people over 55, although support from this cohort remained at 48%. A majority of the sample (68%) expressed a preference for investing in social and community housing over the preservation of negative gearing concessions (32%). A majority again (61%) nominated funding universal access to early learning for three- and four-year-olds over continuing tax credits for \u201cpeople with shares who do not pay any income tax\u201d (39%), and increasing the Newstart allowance was a more popular idea than continuing \u201cto allow people to split incomes through family trusts to minimise tax\u201d. Asked which was the better party on tax policy, Labor was seen as best for first-homebuyers, pensioners and workers earning up to $150,000 per year, while the government was seen as the best party for property investors, people who use family trusts, self-funded retirees and workers earning more than $150,000 per year. Morrison has branded Labor the party of higher taxes, but voters perceptions of that are mixed. Thirty-five per cent agrees Labor will increase taxes while 22% disagree and 43% are either neutral or don\u2019t know, and 37% agree with a statement that taxes will always be higher under Labor while 23% disagree and 40% are either neutral or don\u2019t know. Voters were asked to rank the issues they felt the government should address over the next 12 months. Top of the list was improving the health system (31% of the sample placed it in their top three), reducing utility bills (31%) and creating jobs and reducing unemployment (28%). A focus on the fate of refugees, and the imperative of combatting international crime and terrorism, was much further down the list of priorities. Six per cent put refugees and fighting terror in their top three issues.",

The multinational company qualified for climate funding to help pay for the fossil fuel plant at its Gove Peninsula bauxite mine despite the generator being commissioned before the fund opened. It is one of several fossil fuel developments by large companies registered with the fund, which the then prime minister Tony Abbott introduced to pay farmers and businesses to cut greenhouse gases below what they otherwise would have been. Environmentalists and academics are calling for the scheme to be scrapped or narrowed so it does not support fossil fuel projects and includes a tougher test of whether developments would have gone ahead without public money. National emissions have risen each year since the fund was introduced with an initial $2.55bn four years ago. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced on Monday the fund would be renamed and receive an extra $2bn over a decade, or $200m a year.

The names of the first three daughters are April, May and June. What\u2019s the name of the fourth daughter?</em></p> <p><strong>Solution</strong></p> <p>Anna, of course! Yes, it\u2019s an old chestnut\u2026</p> <p>2) <em>Two men marry each other\u2019s mothers. What is the relationship between their sons?</em></p> <p><strong>Solution</strong></p> <p>They are uncle/nephew to each other. This puzzle dates from the eighth century, and is the earliest of this type of kinship riddle.</p> <p>(I\u2019d also accept the answer posted below the line, which said the relationship would be \u201cquite strained.\u201d)</p> <p>Let\u2019s call the protagonists Man 1 and Man 2, who have mums Mum 1 and Mum 2. The couples are therefore Man 1 and Mum 2, and Man 2 and Mum 1. If the first couple have Son A, and the second couple have Son B, then Son A is half-brother to Man 2, and thus half-uncle to Son B, who is Man 2\u2019s son. It\u2019s easier to see when drawn as a family tree.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3a1c070e2f96a15033ac61c952defda9c92e531\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3a1c070e2f96a15033ac61c952defda9c92e531/324_275_1082_649/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>3) <em>A certain man had great grandchildren, yet none of his grandchildren had any children. How come?</em></p> <p><strong>Solution</strong></p> <p>The question talks about great grandchildren, not great-grandchildren. The hyphen makes all the difference. The grandchildren were great, top, brilliant and awesome, but childless.</p> <p>4) <em>What\u2019s the smallest possible number of people in a family group that contains a grandfather, a grandmother, two fathers, two mothers, four children, three grandchildren, one brother, two sisters, two sons, two daughters, one father-in-law, one mother-in-law and one daughter-in-law?</em></p> <p><strong>Solution</strong></p> <p>Seven. Three siblings (two girls and a boy), their parents, and the father\u2019s parents. Again, it is easier to see when drawn as a family tree.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41ddfb05bb845f076cb62a28e4fea2bdcec76cf2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41ddfb05bb845f076cb62a28e4fea2bdcec76cf2/379_283_1016_609/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>5) <em>On one day my friend Olivia has her birthday.

      "bodyText": "Earlier today I set you the following five puzzles. 1) Anna\u2019s father has four daughters. The names of the first three daughters are April, May and June. What\u2019s the name of the fourth daughter? Solution Anna, of course! Yes, it\u2019s an old chestnut\u2026 2) Two men marry each other\u2019s mothers. What is the relationship between their sons? Solution They are uncle/nephew to each other. This puzzle dates from the eighth century, and is the earliest of this type of kinship riddle. (I\u2019d also accept the answer posted below the line, which said the relationship would be \u201cquite strained.\u201d) Let\u2019s call the protagonists Man 1 and Man 2, who have mums Mum 1 and Mum 2. The couples are therefore Man 1 and Mum 2, and Man 2 and Mum 1. If the first couple have Son A, and the second couple have Son B, then Son A is half-brother to Man 2, and thus half-uncle to Son B, who is Man 2\u2019s son. It\u2019s easier to see when drawn as a family tree. 3) A certain man had great grandchildren, yet none of his grandchildren had any children. How come? Solution The question talks about great grandchildren, not great-grandchildren. The hyphen makes all the difference. The grandchildren were great, top, brilliant and awesome, but childless. 4) What\u2019s the smallest possible number of people in a family group that contains a grandfather, a grandmother, two fathers, two mothers, four children, three grandchildren, one brother, two sisters, two sons, two daughters, one father-in-law, one mother-in-law and one daughter-in-law? Solution Seven. Three siblings (two girls and a boy), their parents, and the father\u2019s parents. Again, it is easier to see when drawn as a family tree. 5) On one day my friend Olivia has her birthday. Two days later it is the birthday of her elder twin, Oliver. Please explain. Solution Oliver was born on March 1 on a plane flying eastwards over the Pacific. A few seconds later the plane crosses the International Date Line, and Olivia is born. She is thus born on February 28, making her the \u2018younger\u2019 sister with a calendar birth date one day before her brother\u2019s. On leap years, however, Olivia will celebrate her birthday two calendar days before her older twin. I hope you enjoyed today\u2019s puzzles. I\u2019ll be back in two weeks.

      "bodyText": "Chris Grayling has been accused of trying to conduct large parts of a trial over the \u00a314m Brexit ferry fiasco in private, against the principle of open justice, the high court has heard. The transport secretary is being sued by Eurotunnel over the allegedly unlawful award of a government contract to Seaborne Freight, a company with no ships, and two other ferry companies, in a case due to start on Friday. Lawyers for Eurotunnel told the high court on Monday that the minister was trying to keep the majority of documents in relation to the contract out of the public domain. They said they did not know his reasons but argued that if Grayling was trying to avoid adverse publicity or embarrassment then this was not legally justifiable. \u201cIt appears \u2026 that the secretary of state is seeking to maintain extensive claims to confidentiality in relation to large numbers of disclosed documents and appears to intend that large parts, if not all, of the trial should be held in private,\u201d Eurotunnel said in a submission. The company\u2019s lawyers said Grayling\u2019s approach was unjustified and they reminded lawyers for the Department for Transport (DfT) that the judge Mr Justice Fraser had previously told them the court was \u201cnot a marketing or PR department for any litigant and the principle of open justice is an important one\u201d. Eurotunnel claimed Grayling\u2019s \u201cconduct in this case is far removed from that which would be expected by a responsible [public body] defendant engaged in high profile and urgent litigation\u201d. The lawyers told the judge it was clear the vast majority of the material that had been disclosed to them about the Seaborne contract was not confidential and should be available for public scrutiny. \u201cIt may be that the material is perceived by government to be profoundly embarrassing and it would naturally prefer that it is not in the public domain. That would be, of course, an entirely irrelevant consideration in relation to matters of confidentiality,\u201d the lawyers for Eurotunnel said. The DfT was ordered to review all 8,000 documents that had been disclosed in the case and to return to court by 4.30pm on Thursday with its legal justification for its desired confidentiality. Eurotunnel, which operates the Channel tunnel, is arguing that ferry contracts totalling \u00a3108m were awarded to Seaborne and two other firms through a \u201csecretive and flawed\u201d procurement process. Grayling cancelled the contract with Seaborne this month after it emerged that the company had no contract with the ports involved in the proposed new ferry route between Ramsgate and Ostend. The DfT said it could not comment on ongoing proceedings. In its submissions to the court, it said the scale of disclosure was far greater than anticipated, running to 10,000 documents. It said the burden of disclosure was far greater on the defendant and the process was \u201cextremely time consuming\u201d given the necessary reviews, before submission, of legally and personally sensitive data. The DfT argued it would make the documents available confidentially until the documents relevant to the trial were identified. It said that the legitimate need for confidentiality could not be jettisoned simply because the trial was fast-tracked.",

Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB led the way, gaining almost 0.9% amid relief that Fitch has left its credit rating unchanged. Germany\u2019s DAX rose by 0.5%, and the French CAC picked up 0.35%, as industrial groups and technology firms benefitted from trade war d\u00e9tente. The FTSE 100 only gained five points, or 0.07%, though. It was partly dragged down by falling energy company shares (hit by the drop in the oil price). Davod Madden of CMC Markets has picked out some of the key moves today: Persimmon shares are in the red after it was reported over the weekend that it might be stripped of its \u2018help to buy\u2019 status. The home builder has benefited greatly from the government scheme which assists first-time buyers get onto the property ladder. Persimmon has been subject to complaints in relation to property standards and the government is reviewing which companies will be allowed participate in the scheme after 2021, and investors are worried Persimmon might be excluded. The stock gapped lower this morning, and while it holds below the 200-day moving average at 2,370p, its outlook should remain negative. Associated British Foods confirmed that Primark\u2019s first-half like-for-like sales dropped by 2%, and analysts were expecting a 1.6% decline. Total revenue increased by 4% for the period, but traders were expecting 4.8% growth. The firm performed well in Spain, France and Italy, but underperformed in Germany. Total UK Primark sales ticked up 2% and the US operation performed \u2018strongly\u2019, and full-year guidance remains unchanged. The stock has been in decline since November, and a break below 2,200p might bring the 2,000p region into play. Provident Financial has knocked back a \u00a31.3 billion offer from Non-Standard Finance. Provident described the move as highly \u2018opportunistic\u2019, and they felt the bid does not reflect the company\u2019s true value. The share price of Provident Financial sold-off greatly in 2017, and hasn\u2019t recovered, and Provident feel the bid would be undervalue the firm. Neil Wilson of Markets.com also senses the US stock market is reaching a crunch moment....but will the rally subside, or crack on? One upbeat tweet does not a trade deal make. While Donald Trump insisted that \u201csubstantial progress\u201d has been made with China, we still don\u2019t know what - if any - concessions Beijing has made. And with both sides keen to get a deal, some US hardliners fear the president might let the Chinese officials off too easily. The Financial Times suspects this could lead to a backlash, saying: Among the biggest unanswered questions is the extent to which China has offered any meaningful concessions on some of its core economic policies that US negotiators have been seeking to reverse. On Sunday, Mr Trump justified his decision to keep negotiations alive and not proceed with higher tariffs by citing \u201csubstantial progress\u201d on structural issues such as China\u2019s pervasive use of industrial subsidies or the protection of American intellectual property from theft or forced transfer. Yet there is scant evidence that Beijing has offered to make a big change in course, or to provide a mechanism to assure Washington that it will stick by any commitments. \u201cI don\u2019t think any agreement will resolve the underlying problem,\u201d said Wang Wen, executive dean of the Chongyang Institute, a think-tank under Renmin University. \u201cThe difference is very great and so we can only approach it bit by bit. This time we can only sketch the broad outlines. More here: Donald Trump risks political backlash as deal grows more likely Stocks are sneaking a little higher on Wall Street now, putting the Dow Jones industrial average 200 points higher at 26,233 points (up 0.8% today). The tech-focused Nasdaq is up 1%, on hopes that technology companies will be spared higher tariffs on Chinese-made components. Donald Trump has returned to one of his favourite hobbies - tweeting about the stock market: He\u2019s right, too. The Dow closed at 18,259 points on 7th November 2016, before the Trump\u2019s shock victory over Hillary Clinton was announced. Trump\u2019s subsequent tax cuts programme then helped to pump up the market, with companies announcing share buyback programmes and higher dividends. GE (now up 11%) and Danaher (+7.4%) are leading the Wall Street risers, thanks to their bioscience deal. They\u2019re followed by hard drive maker Western Digital (+4.8%) and chipmaker AMD (+4%), with retailer Macy\u2019s and tiremaker Goodyear (both +3.1%) close behind. This is keeping the S&amp;P 500 at a three-month high, following the Chinese market\u2019s best day since 2015. Randeep Somel, Director of Global Equities at M&amp;G, believes we could see further gains - if presidents Trump and Xi sign off a deal soon. Should the talks conclude positively it will likely be received positively by global markets particularly those sectors and companies that are reliant on global trade; from Boeing and Apple in the US, global shipping companies, to semiconductor manufacturers in China. The Chinese market will likely see the most positive reaction as there are signs the domestic economy is slowing down and this uncertainty disappearing will likely be a welcome stimulant. Both sides reacted positively to the latest rounds of talks but did comment that bilateral trade deals are \u201ccomplicated and arduous.\u201d With the 2020 elections in the US approaching, President Trump will have the added impetus of wanting to show the American electorate that he has delivered on trade policy. The US stock market has nearly recovered all last autumn\u2019s losses, thanks to its rally this year. Market analyst David Jones suggests this could lead to volatility -- will traders be tempted to cash profits, or will they decide the worst is over and pile into equities? Industrial groups and tech firms are leading the rally in New York, as trade war optimism ripples across Wall Street. Shares in GE have surged by 13% after it agreed to sell its biopharmaceutical business to rival conglomerate Danaher in a $21.4bn all-cash deal. Ding Ding! The New York stock market has hit a fresh three and a half-month high at the start of trading. Shares are rallying across Wall Street, following the news that president Donald Trump has dropped his threat to raise tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports from 10% to 25% on March 1st. The S&amp;P 500 index has gained 0.6%, or 16 points, to 2,809 - its highest level since early November. The Dow is up 174 points, or 0.67%, to 26,205. Neil MacKinnon, global macro economist at VTB Capital, says the financial markets are enjoying a Happy Monday (a change from the bellyaches at the end of 2018). Trump\u2019s decision to extend the deadline for a trade deal is largely reponsible, MacKinnon says: There is also talk of a summit at some point between the US and China, at which an agreement over trade can be reached. The US-China trade dispute has been a drag on the global economy and world trade for over a year and Asian export growth has slumped. Now a key negative for both the global economy and global markets looks as though it is being removed. In addition, geopolitical risk is mitigated by the Trump-Kim Summit in Hanoi on Wednesday. If a trade deal is achieved, then the risks of a global recession should recede, MacKinnon adds: A US-China trade agreement might trigger a recovery in demand and investment as a key uncertainty is removed. Cambridge University economist Helen Thompson points out that the oil price is already lower than during previous Trump attacks on Opec - a sign that the global economy has slowed. US crude oil has fallen sharply since Donald Trump urged OPEC to relax - and stop cutting production. A barrel of New York light crude is now changing hands at $55.96 per barrel, down 2.5% from $57.53 earlier today. Traders are calculating that White House will encourage the oil cartel to keep the pumps open. Crude oil prices have risen by roughly a quarter during 2019, after Opec agreed to cut production. So will Trump\u2019s latest twitter blast have a major impact? Analysts aren\u2019t sure, as Bloomberg explains: \u201cWe might see a less aggressive stance on supply cuts from the Saudis -- this might stop them from cutting deeper,\u201d said Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS Group AG in Zurich. \u201cBut I still think Saudi Arabia has the incentive to see higher oil prices, and deliver the cuts agreed in December,\u201d when OPEC and its partners agreed to remove 1.2 million barrels a day. Today\u2019s tweet is the eighth time that @realdonaldtrump has challenged Opec to take action to lower the oil price, points out analyst John Kemp: Warren Buffett has also brushed aside the idea that wealthy people would flee America if they faced a higher tax burden. In a refreshing blast of realism, Buffett tells CNBC that most rich people, if they were sane, would rather be taxed half of their wealth and stay in the US rather than leave and keep the lot. The wealthy are under-taxed relative to the rest of the population. Buffett also points out that America\u2019s finances are \u201cout of whack\u201d right now, with the Trump White House running a one trillion dollar deficit during a time of growth. The solution - spend less, or tax more. Veteran investor Warren Buffett has welcomed Donald Trump\u2019s decision to to extend negotiations with China, rather than impose higher tariffs on half its exports to the US. Speaking on CNBC, Buffett said he was \u201crelieved\u201d there is a chance that a deeper trade war can be avoided, saying it would be \u201cbad for China, and bad for us\u201d. Buffett hopes that the two sides will work out \u201csomething sensible\u201d that they can both accept, rather than descend into damaging protectionism, saying Negotiations are tough, this is a big deal to both countries, and to some extent you\u2019re playing a game of chicken.... Donald Trump is awake, and tweeting that Opec should chill out. What has prompted this? Well, US crude oil prices have risen over $57 per barrel in recent days, for the first time since November. Brent crude has hit a three-month high around $\u00a367/barrel, which will push up transport and heating costs. That follows OPEC\u2019s recent decision to cut supply; US sanctions against Iran and Venezuela\u2019s oil exports have also hit supply, putting upward pressure on crude. Trump\u2019s tweet is already hitting prices.... The cost of the UK phone hacking scandal continues to climb. Reach, the publisher of the Mirror, Express and Star newspapers, has set aside another \u00a35m to cover \u201chistorical legal issues\u201d. That takes its total provision to \u00a375.5m. Reach blames \u201cincreased legal fees for the claimants\u2019 lawyers\u201d for this latest increase, which follows an extra \u00a37.5m announced in June. You could fill a dinner party with celebrities who have sued Reach, saying their voicemail messages were wrongfully intercepted by its journalists. Elizabeth Hurley, Sadie Frost, Jeffrey Archer, Patsy Kensit, Denise van Outen, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Kevin Keegan, Charles Clarke (ex-home secretary) Les Dennis, Natasha Kaplinsky, Steve McFadden, Danielle Lloyd, Jennifer Ellison, Dwight Yorke and Andrew Cole have all reached settlements with the company over phone hacking. Reach also announced a jump in revenues, following the takeover of the Express and Star. But it posted a pre-tax loss of \u00a3120m last year, after taking a \u00a3200m writedown on the value of its goodwill, publishing rights and titles. It put some of the blame on Brexit, saying: \u201cThis reflects the more challenging than expected trading environment for advertising revenue generated locally and the short term uncertainty arising from the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union.\u201d In other news, UK property magnate Hammerson is in talks to sell off more than \u00a3900m of property after being hit by the crisis in Britain\u2019s retail sector. Hammerson, which owns shopping centres including Birmingham\u2019s Bullring and London\u2019s Brent Cross, has been burned by the wave of store closures and company collapses. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: Among Hammerson\u2019s tenants are Patisserie Valerie, which went into administration last month but was saved from closure by a management buyout backed by an Irish private equity firm, as well as House of Fraser and New Look. Both resorted to company voluntary arrangement to avoid insolvency, which forced the firms to close a string of stores and seek rent cuts from their landlords. Back in Beijing, government officials have said a US-China trade deal is getting closer.... Reuters has the details: The Chinese government\u2019s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, told a forum in Beijing on Monday that the talks had made \u201csubstantive progress\u201d, providing positive expectations for the stability of bilateral ties and global economic development, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said. China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary that the goal of an agreement was getting \u201ccloser and closer\u201d, but also warned that negotiations would get more difficult as they approached the final stages. \u201cThe emergence of new uncertainty cannot be ruled out, and the long-term nature, complexity, and difficulty of China-U.S. trade frictions must be clearly recognized,\u201d Xinhua said. The post-Brexit derivatives deal hammered out by the US and the UK should be welcomed by the City - here\u2019s the latest reaction: Just in: The UK and the US have reached an agreement to ensure that derivatives trading can continue between the two countries after Brexit. The deal means that City banks and clearing houses will be free to provide services to US clients as they do today, under existing EU rules. This continuity could protect a massively important part of London\u2019s financial sector, as it braces for Brexit disruption. It follows negotiations between the Bank of England, City watchdog the FCA, and regulators at America\u2019s Commodity Futures Trading Commission. BoE governor Mark Carney says the deal will provide continuity, and avoid the fragmentation of the derivatives market - which could raise costs and financial risk. Derivatives contracts are pegged to the value of an underlying asset, allowing companies to protect themselves against falls in commodity prices, for example, or currency fluctuations. The derivatives market is worth trillions of pounds per year, many contracts settled in London. CFTC chairman Christopher Giancarlo is in London to announce the deal, which he says is important to the high streets of Britain and the main streets of America. What happens in global derivatives markets has a material impact for the man or the woman on the Clapham Omnibus, the Santa Monica freeway or the Tokyo subway. Derivatives markets influencing the price and availability of heating on homes, the rates on home mortgages, and the return on people\u2019s savings, Giancarlo adds. Share in European carmakers have jumped by over 1.5% this morning, to their highest level since last November. Many EU auto firms have factories in China and/or the US, so would have suffered from increased tariffs on imports between the two countries. Here\u2019s our news story on Karren Brady\u2019s departure from Taveta: Newsflash: Baroness Karren Brady has resigned as chair of the company behind Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail empire, Taveta Investments. Non-executive director Sharon Brown is also leaving. Here\u2019s the statement from Taveta. \u201cTaveta would like to announce that Karren Brady and Sharon Brown (in their respective capacities as non-executive chairman and non-executive director) have resigned from its board. Taveta thanks them for their contribution and wishes them well for the future. Taveta is in active discussions with individuals who have significant relevant experience and expects to make a further announcement as to the composition of its board shortly. The board of the Taveta group\u2019s main operating company, Arcadia Group Limited (under the chairmanship of group CEO, Ian Grabiner), and the boards of all the other trading companies within the group remain both unchanged and committed to the group\u2019s strategy for the benefit of all stakeholders.\u201d Earlier this month Baroness Brady said she felt a \u201csense of duty\u201d to Taveta\u2019s staff to remain in her post, following allegations against Green published by the Daily Telegraph. With just 32 days to go until Brexit Day, UK businesses are becoming increasingly - and understandably - anxious. The finance director of Associated British Foods has warned that it\u2019s \u201cunbelievable\u201d that a no-deal Brexit is still on the table. John Bason told Reuters that a hard Brexit would be \u2018irresponsible\u2019, saying: \u201cFor it even to be contemplated - a hard Brexit where you\u2019ve got no arrangement with your major trading partners and when we\u2019re so reliant on them for the food supply chain - I find it unbelievable. \u201cThe consequences of getting this wrong for people are major and I want people to understand that. With Theresa May delaying the Meaningful Vote on Brexit, again, speculation is building this morning that the UK\u2019s departure could be delayed. The Telegraph is reporting that Brexit could be postponed by up to two months, while we\u2019ve heard that EU officials could offer a delay until 2021. Our politics liveblog is tracking all the action: Britain\u2019s housebuilders are bucking the trend this morning, as they slide to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. Persimmon has slumped by almost 7%, after it emerged the company could lose its right to sell houses under the Help to Buy scheme. Government insiders say housing secretary James Brokenshire is \u201cincreasingly concerned\u201d by Persimmon\u2019s behaviour - from complaints over quality of its homes to the row over the huge bonuses paid to CEO Jeff Fairburn. Persimmon has boosted its profits thanks to the Help to Buy scheme (which helps new customers onto the property ladder). So if Brokenshire decides to red-card Persimmon, it could have a major impact on its bottom line. The prospect of a government clampdown has hurt rival housebuilders; Taylor Wimpey are down 3%, with Barratt down 2.5%. Wall Street is expected to hit a new 2019 high when trading resumes in New York in under six hours time. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: With the Asian markets surging to a 5 month high in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s comments, the Dow Jones is set to hit its own 26100-plus, 3 and a half-month peak when it opens later this afternoon.Yet the European indices weren\u2019t anywhere near as giddy, perhaps held back by the ongoing lack of clarity over what exactly is going to happen with Brexit. China\u2019s stock market has been through a wild year -- falling steadily in 2018, before surging back in 2019. Germany\u2019s DAX index has jumped 0.6% in early trading, as Frankfurt traders welcome the ceasefire in the trade war. Germany\u2019s economy hasn\u2019t grown since last summer, with exports suffering from trade disruption, so its manufacturers will be hoping that Trump and Xi sign off an agreement soon. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has jumped by 20 points in early trading to 7198, as the relief rally reaches Europe. Mining group Glencore is the top riser, up 2%. Demand for its iron ore and coal reserves will rise if a trade war is averted. Financial groups Prudential (+1.8%) and Standard Chartered (1.5%), which both have strong exposure to Asia, are close behind. Virtually every stock on China\u2019s CSI300 index rose today, with financial stocks and technology companies leading the sizzling rally. Scores of stocks were suspended after jumping more than 10%, which is the largest gain allowed by Chinese regulators. Tai Hui of J.P. Morgan Asset Management takes a cautious line, saying: \u201cThe latest news may not offer a significant boost to start the week. Nonetheless, it helps to underpin positive investor sentiment.\u201d The US-China trade war has been a big culprit behind the recent slowdown in the global economy, so there should be widespread relief that it isn\u2019t about to get any worse. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, argues that economic and political pressures forced Donald Trump to give China more time to reach a trade deal. He writes: The trade dispute has been a painful one for both countries and the world, especially since it occurred when the economic cycle approached a peak. While China wants to prevent a hard landing, President Trump wants to fulfill one of his key campaign promises to correct the trade deficit. However, to support his re-election bid, Trump needs to avoid dragging down the U.S. economy and thus announce a deal, even though it might not look like a perfect one. Equity markets in mainland China were the main beneficiaries of Trump\u2019s announcement on extending the 1 March deadline. The blue-chip CSI 300 Index surged 4% today, hitting its highest level since June 2018; it has entered a bull market, rising more than 23% from January lows. The Chinese Yuan also strengthened 0.4%, reaching a 7-month high. The improved appetite for risk has provided a boost for high beta currencies like the Australian and New Zealand Dollars, with both rising 0.3% during Asia trade. Elsewhere, the reaction has been muted, with the Euro, Pound and Yen moving in very tight ranges. Turnover on the Chinese stock exchanges has been huge today, after president Trump removed the threat of raising tariffs at the end of this month. The turnaround in the Chinese stock market this year is quite something, even before today\u2019s surge: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A fragile truce has broken out in the US-China trade war, sending investors in Asia into a share-buying flurry. Overnight, president Donald Trump announced he was extending the deadline on increasing tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports beyond 1st March. That removes the risk that the trade war between Washington and Beijing escalates further, dragging the world into a deeper slowdown. So why the change of heart? According to Trump, there has been \u201csubstantial progress\u201d between the two sides, following high-level talks between officials in recent weeks. The president also dangled the possibility that he might sign off a deal when he meets with China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping. We don\u2019t know when this Trump-Xi summit might take place. And there\u2019s a suspicion that Trump has blinked, by kicking his own deadline down the road. As Sue Trinh of Royal Bank of Canada puts it: Nothing has been confirmed and we think it will be impossible for China to conform to US demands on substantive core issues. But that\u2019s for another day. But in the short term, relief is coursing through the markets, particularly in Asia. China\u2019s main equities indices have surged by almost six percent, to an eight-month high. This means China\u2019s stock market has gained almost 20% since the start of the year, putting it officially into a Bull Market, as it recovers much of its shocking losses in 2018. Traders are clearly hopeful that Washington and Beijing can put months of quarrelling, and tit-for-tat tariffs, behind then. My colleague Martin Farrer explains: China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency echoed Trump\u2019s comments and said the two sides \u201ccame a step closer to realising the important consensus reached\u201d by Trump and Xi Jinping when they agreed to a trade war truce in December. The delegations agreed to \u201ccarry out follow-ups in accordance with the instructions of the two heads of state\u201d. The delay in tariffs was the clearest sign yet of a breakthrough the two sides have sought since calling a 90-day truce in a trade war last year. It will likely be cheered by markets as a sign of an end to the year-long dispute that has disrupted commerce worth hundreds of billions of dollars of goods and slowed global economic growth. Other Asia-Pacific markets have also rallied, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index up 0.5% and Japan\u2019s Topix gaining 0.7%. European stocks are expected to pick up the baton, with the FTSE 100 called up 0.35%. Otherwise, the economic calendar looks rather bare today. But we do get results from Associated British Food (which owns Primark), media group Reach, and distribution giant Bunzl.",

      "body": "<p>\u2018What\u2019s Spike Lee going to have to say about this?\u201d That was the first question on many minds after the initial shock of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/25/green-book-wins-oscar-for-best-picture-2019\" title=\"\">Green Book winning the best picture Oscar</a>. We were just waiting for a reaction shot of Lee, applauding resignedly at history repeating itself. It was nearly 30 years ago that Lee was in a similar situation, when the anodyne, feelgood civil rights film Driving Miss Daisy won best picture, while Lee\u2019s exhilarating Do the Right Thing went home empty-handed. Green Book was this year\u2019s Driving Miss Daisy. While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/26/blackkklansman-review-spike-lee-blistering-return-to-form\" title=\"\">Lee\u2019s considerably more confrontational BlacKkKlansman</a> \u2013 also nominated for best picture \u2013 didn\u2019t go home empty-handed, it must have felt like insult added to injury. According to the reporter Andrew Dalton, Lee was \u201cvisibly angry\u201d at the announcement, \u201cwaving his arms in disgust and appearing to try to storm out of the Dolby theatre before he was stopped at the doors\u201d.</p> <p>Ironically, at first glance, Green Book and BlacKkKlansman have much in common. Both are set in the recent past and tackle US racism via a reluctant friendship between a black man and a white man. But where Green Book falls firmly into the category you could call \u201cIsn\u2019t it great how we\u2019re not as racist as we used to be\u201d movies, BlacKkKlansman concludes the opposite. Its sting-in-the-tail coda \u2013 footage from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/12/charlottesville-far-right-crowd-with-torches-encircles-counter-protest-group\" title=\"\">the 2017 white-nationalist march in Charlottesville</a>, North Carolina, cheered on by the Ku Klux Klan \u2013 is a reminder that the US is every bit as racist as it used to be.

This time, at least, he received the Oscar for best adapted screenplay \u2013 and used his acceptance speech to inject a dose of bubble-bursting realism into a ceremony that seemed hell-bent on eradicating it. Lee invoked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blackhistorymonth\" title=\"\">Black History Month</a>, the genocide of Native Americans and the 400th anniversary of his ancestors arriving on American shores, \u201cstolen from mother Africa and brought to Jamestown, Virginia\u201d.

Javier Bardem mentioned walls and borders (in Spanish) when presenting best foreign film to Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, for example, while Rami Malek spoke of his own and Freddie Mercury\u2019s immigrant backgrounds.

      "bodyText": "\u2018What\u2019s Spike Lee going to have to say about this?\u201d That was the first question on many minds after the initial shock of Green Book winning the best picture Oscar. We were just waiting for a reaction shot of Lee, applauding resignedly at history repeating itself. It was nearly 30 years ago that Lee was in a similar situation, when the anodyne, feelgood civil rights film Driving Miss Daisy won best picture, while Lee\u2019s exhilarating Do the Right Thing went home empty-handed. Green Book was this year\u2019s Driving Miss Daisy. While Lee\u2019s considerably more confrontational BlacKkKlansman \u2013 also nominated for best picture \u2013 didn\u2019t go home empty-handed, it must have felt like insult added to injury. According to the reporter Andrew Dalton, Lee was \u201cvisibly angry\u201d at the announcement, \u201cwaving his arms in disgust and appearing to try to storm out of the Dolby theatre before he was stopped at the doors\u201d. Ironically, at first glance, Green Book and BlacKkKlansman have much in common. Both are set in the recent past and tackle US racism via a reluctant friendship between a black man and a white man. But where Green Book falls firmly into the category you could call \u201cIsn\u2019t it great how we\u2019re not as racist as we used to be\u201d movies, BlacKkKlansman concludes the opposite. Its sting-in-the-tail coda \u2013 footage from the 2017 white-nationalist march in Charlottesville, North Carolina, cheered on by the Ku Klux Klan \u2013 is a reminder that the US is every bit as racist as it used to be. Green Book finished with a wishful, small-scale racial truce; BlacKkKlansman delivered a harder, less convenient truth. At the awards ceremony, Lee served a similar function to his movie. This time, at least, he received the Oscar for best adapted screenplay \u2013 and used his acceptance speech to inject a dose of bubble-bursting realism into a ceremony that seemed hell-bent on eradicating it. Lee invoked Black History Month, the genocide of Native Americans and the 400th anniversary of his ancestors arriving on American shores, \u201cstolen from mother Africa and brought to Jamestown, Virginia\u201d. He ended on an unambiguously current note: \u201cThe 2020 presidential election is around the corner. Let\u2019s all mobilise, let\u2019s all be on the right side of history. Make the moral choice between love versus hate. Let\u2019s do the right thing!\u201d Inevitably, Donald Trump tweeted back, complaining about Lee\u2019s \u201cracist hit on your president\u201d and listing his own (self-identified) achievements for African Americans, as if there were any question over whose word African-American voters would trust more. Lee was not quite a lone voice in referencing politics at the Oscars, even if others did it more obliquely. Javier Bardem mentioned walls and borders (in Spanish) when presenting best foreign film to Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, for example, while Rami Malek spoke of his own and Freddie Mercury\u2019s immigrant backgrounds. But the memo for this year\u2019s Oscars seemed to read: \u201cPolitical correctness: fine; actual politics: no, thanks.\u201d In an Academy more hesitant than ever about what it is supposed to do or be, politics is now seen as a ratings loser. This is especially true after 2018\u2019s ceremony, in which the presenter, Jimmy Kimmel, and various award-winners spoke directly about racism, gun control, sexual abuse, women\u2019s rights, immigration and, of course, Trump.

In 2015, while receiving an honorary Oscar at the Governors\u2019 awards at the height of the #OscarSoWhite debacle, Lee told his audience of Hollywood heavyweights: \u201cEverybody in here probably voted for Obama, but when I go to offices I don\u2019t see no black folks except for the brother man at the security.\u201d The industry needed to have a serious conversation about diversity, he warned. \u201cYou better get smart, because your workforce should reflect what this country looks like.\u201d If the Academy thought they had brought Lee on side with the honorary gong, for his contributions to film-making, they were mistaken: Lee went on to boycott the Oscar ceremony proper a few months later, in protest at the lack of African-American nominees.

It is enough, it has been calculated, to pave over the entire city of Manchester. A more modest 3 million tonnes of concrete will be needed to construct the Hinckley B nuclear power station in Somerset, and the proposed new runway at Heathrow will require one million tonnes. Cement, the key component of concrete and one of the most widely used manmade materials, is now the cornerstone of global construction. It has shaped the modern environment, but its production has a massive footprint that neither the industry nor governments have been willing to address. Because of the heat needed to decompose rock and the natural chemical processes involved in making cement, every tonne made releases one tonne of C02, the main greenhouse warming gas. Including the new Crossrail line through London, the building of Britain\u2019s four largest current construction projects will, if completed, together emit more than 10m tonnes of CO2 \u2013 roughly the same amount as a city the size of Birmingham, or what 19 million Malawians emit in a year.

      "bodyText": "Tony Pike, the hotelier who epitomised the hedonism of the holiday clubbing island Ibiza, has died at the age of 85. He had been suffering from prostate and skin cancer. His death was announced on his Facebook page, Pikes Ibiza, accompanied by the message \u201cYour legend will never die\u201d. Pike founded the Pikes Hotel in San Antonio in 1978. It went on to became a much-mythologised venue for raucous parties and a favourite hangout for celebrities. Pike was described by the Guardian last year as the \u201cringmaster for 30 years of celebrity debauchery\u201d. The hotel secured its reputation as the centre of the Ibiza party scene when it featured in a video of the 1983 Wham! hit Club Tropicana. A bare-chested Pike appears at the start of the video in a straw hat welcoming guests to the pool side of his establishment before George Michael sings about a place where you can \u201cbrush shoulders with the stars\u201d. The hotel also hosted an infamously bawdy 41st birthday party for Freddie Mercury in 1987. The guests included Grace Jones and Julio Iglesias. Pike, recalling the party, said: \u201cMoney was no object. Freddie sought sanctuary in the hotel and wanted a party to remember. When I asked him about the budget he just laughed and said there was none. \u201cWe could freeze the swimming pool and have skating elephants if we wanted. He just wanted it to be wild.\u201d In 2008, Pike sold the hotel to its current owners, Ibiza Rocks. In 2017 he published his account of the running the hotel in his book, Mr Pikes: The Story Behind The Ibiza Legend. Celebrities who enjoyed Pike\u2019s hospitality were quick to pay tribute. Norman Cook, aka Fatboy Slim, tweeted that Pike was \u201clarger than life and twice as entertaining\u201d. The actor Leo Gregory said on Instagram: \u201cFrom my early days on the island staying at Pikes, where he got me out of a scrape or two, to the last time I saw him in December he was always full of life, love and mischief.\u201d The Twitter account for the Ministry of Sound nightclub described Pike as an \u201cIbiza icon\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>A Grenfell survivor is taking legal action against Kensington and Chelsea council, claiming it failed to provide her with permanent housing more than 20 months after the fire.</p> <p> Helen Gebremeskel and her daughter Lulya, 14, are claiming the borough has failed to implement its own policies for rehousing survivors in the case of her and her daughter. Both mother and daughter have been diagnosed with PTSD following the tower block fire, which claimed 72 lives.</p> <p>Gebremeskel led other survivors down the stairs wrapped in wet towels. She often took the stairs so was more familiar with them than some of the other survivors. They encountered horrific scenes as they left the building, including seeing the bodies of some of those who had died while trying to escape.</p> <p>She became separated from Lulya, who was rescued by a firefighter. For hours after she escaped, Gebremeskel did not know where her daughter was or whether she was alive.

      "bodyText": "A Grenfell survivor is taking legal action against Kensington and Chelsea council, claiming it failed to provide her with permanent housing more than 20 months after the fire. Helen Gebremeskel and her daughter Lulya, 14, are claiming the borough has failed to implement its own policies for rehousing survivors in the case of her and her daughter. Both mother and daughter have been diagnosed with PTSD following the tower block fire, which claimed 72 lives. Gebremeskel led other survivors down the stairs wrapped in wet towels. She often took the stairs so was more familiar with them than some of the other survivors. They encountered horrific scenes as they left the building, including seeing the bodies of some of those who had died while trying to escape. She became separated from Lulya, who was rescued by a firefighter. For hours after she escaped, Gebremeskel did not know where her daughter was or whether she was alive. Her daughter was taken to hospital and placed in an induced coma for 10 days because of cyanide poisoning from the fire. Mother and daughter were housed in a hotel for 11 months after the fire in June 2017 and are in temporary accommodation. The council has offered Gebremeskel and her daughter permanent accommodation in blocks of flats with lifts. \u201cWe cannot live in a block after what we went through,\u201d said Gebremeskel. \u201cI have asked for a house, which some of the other survivors have got.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> \n<p>We landed yesterday, but today was the first proper day of Oscar activities, with a screening of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2018/oct/26/black-sheep-the-black-teenager-who-made-friends-with-racists-video\">Black Sheep</a> for Academy voters at the Museum of Tolerance in Beverly Hills. The MoT is an LA institution dedicated to raising awareness of discrimination and attracts a liberal older audience who love to ask questions. They surrounded us afterwards, many wanting to check that I was OK now. The film is about a time in my life 15 years ago when I moved to an estate in Essex to escape racism and violence and found even more of it out there. I\u2019m a film-maker myself but when I met the director, Ed Perkins, we decided it was better to make a documentary where I could tell my story straight to camera.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e8a9bc5c9fd523de2d221b94b271b078970acbf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e8a9bc5c9fd523de2d221b94b271b078970acbf/0_0_2448_3264/750.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>When people come up to me after screenings, they seem to need that confirmation that, after the upset the last 27 minutes on screen has provoked in them, everything is alright now. People\u2019s reactions to the film can be intense.</p> \n<p>The screenings are strange events \u2013 you\u2019re campaigning for votes, but not really allowed to say you are: you have to stay coy and cool. Voting ends tomorrow, and then maybe we can relax a bit.</p> \n<p>Tomorrow\u2019s highlight will be meeting up with the fashion designer Ozwald Boateng to get my Oscars suit. This is the kind of unexpected thing that being nominated gets you.</p> \n<h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> \n<p>Tonight our team attended the official Oscars documentary event where each team of documentary nominees across features and shorts gets five minutes to talk about their film and show a clip from it. Ed and producer Jonathan were first up.</p> \n<p>This is when the reality of being nominated really hits, with a sudden deluge of glamour and prompting thoughts of who you want to meet. I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll meet Spike Lee. Apparently he knows about the film.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4799bfcce5616011b8bdbd44178779684d9047a2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4799bfcce5616011b8bdbd44178779684d9047a2/0_0_1536_2048/750.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Documentaries aren\u2019t glamorous, they\u2019re often hard grinds. Yet this very personal story is now the reason behind a whirlwind of attention for me. Cameras are being shoved in my face and I\u2019m being asked questions like \u201cWhat do you want to get out of this week?\u201d The honest answer is to have a bit of a break, eat some good food, have some fun and meet some new people. That didn\u2019t seem to be the answer the camera people wanted \u2026 they\u2019d have preferred me to shout: \u201cTO WIN!\u201d</p> \n<p>We took a lot of photos with giant statues of the gold Oscar man, pulling a variety of silly (and occasionally serious) faces. There\u2019s something strange about seeing the iconic figure up close. His kitschy pose is everywhere and the more you look at it, especially on gigantic replica statues, the weirder it seems. We tried to mimic his pose \u2013 you just can\u2019t get it right.</p> \n<h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> \n<p>A quieter day that meant me my girlfriend, who\u2019s here from Canada, could look for some of LA\u2019s best Nigerian food. This is a hiatus period between the end of voting and all the bigger pre-ceremony glitz. You hear about the big gifting parties, where stars are offered absurd free things and vouchers for beauty services \u2026 but those companies aren\u2019t so interested in the short documentary nominees. But we want to find a way to get some free Hollywood swag, it feels like it should be part of the Oscars experience.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cf2a9fb5fb4ba7e293135d2523f14c28d6fc60c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cf2a9fb5fb4ba7e293135d2523f14c28d6fc60c/0_296_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>It was a grey day and felt like the glamour had gone away for a bit after the excitement of last night. But in the evening, we did a screening at Soho House on the Sunset Strip and got an amazing view of LA from up high. As usual, the Q&amp;A after felt emotionally intense. We were asked a lot of questions about what the film says about the state of Britain, which is a lot to ask about something that\u2019s just my own personal story. Reliving this hard experience over and over again in such short succession is really hard.</p> \n<p>We talked about how the ceremony would work and realise we didn\u2019t know who was sitting where. Then we went to the party for all the shorts nominees in a little bar.

That and Free Solo.</p> \n<p>Today was also the last Q&amp;A we\u2019ll do for a while, at the International Documentary Association DocuDay event. I\u2019m relieved we won\u2019t have to do this again for a while \u2013 there\u2019s only so many times in one week you can say the same things. We were on the panel with two other shorts in consideration and the Q&amp;A went by in a flash.

It all feels so real.</p> \n<p>People keep telling us we have a good chance, but it\u2019s almost impossible to predict with the shorts awards. Voters don\u2019t talk very much about them, they don\u2019t have the publicity campaigns of the longer films and they\u2019re a lot less political. But you can get excited about the positive predictions. Whatever happens tomorrow, it\u2019s just amazing to be here in this surreal bubble.

It\u2019s like nothing else I\u2019ve ever done.

Then we met downstairs in the hotel and took a load of photos. It was a warm day and the photos we took by the pool were very Californian \u2013 we all looked transformed, like we really were part of the world of Hollywood stars. When you arrive at the Dolby Theater for the event, you feel even more like that. As soon as you get close, there\u2019s streets closed, and when you get out the car, you\u2019re thrown into a world of high-intensity organisation as everyone congratulates you, tells you to get moving, and pushes you towards the red carpet.</p> \n<p>The group was split straight away, with me, Ed and Jonathan going in the lane for the main red carpet and the rest of our team taken away from the press scrum. It\u2019s a strange situation. Our publicist takes us from interview to interview in the tiered banks of hundreds of press representatives all squashed in, while crowds of members of the public sit in rows of bleachers watching us. We got there early so we were probably part of the initial disappointment before the real stars arrived.</p> \n<p>Finally, after about two hours, we were on our way into the theatre itself, and there the reality of where you are properly hits: loads of giant Oscar statues, loads of beautifully dressed people and a giant staircase taking you up to the bars and the seats. This feels like proper old-school Hollywood glamour and everyone is loving it. Celebrities are everywhere, and you\u2019re constantly trying to figure out who these vaguely familiar faces belong to. I loved it, seeing so many of my idols around me. I spoke to Spike Lee and Barry Jenkins, who were really nice. There\u2019s an incredible magical vibe in the room.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/25/red-carpet-fashion-oscars-2019\">Red-carpet fashion at Oscars 2019: 'A bright pink confetti explosion'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For the ceremony itself, we were down on the ground floor, close to all the action.

      "bodyText": "Monday We landed yesterday, but today was the first proper day of Oscar activities, with a screening of Black Sheep for Academy voters at the Museum of Tolerance in Beverly Hills. The MoT is an LA institution dedicated to raising awareness of discrimination and attracts a liberal older audience who love to ask questions. They surrounded us afterwards, many wanting to check that I was OK now. The film is about a time in my life 15 years ago when I moved to an estate in Essex to escape racism and violence and found even more of it out there. I\u2019m a film-maker myself but when I met the director, Ed Perkins, we decided it was better to make a documentary where I could tell my story straight to camera. When people come up to me after screenings, they seem to need that confirmation that, after the upset the last 27 minutes on screen has provoked in them, everything is alright now. People\u2019s reactions to the film can be intense. The screenings are strange events \u2013 you\u2019re campaigning for votes, but not really allowed to say you are: you have to stay coy and cool. Voting ends tomorrow, and then maybe we can relax a bit. Tomorrow\u2019s highlight will be meeting up with the fashion designer Ozwald Boateng to get my Oscars suit. This is the kind of unexpected thing that being nominated gets you. Tuesday Tonight our team attended the official Oscars documentary event where each team of documentary nominees across features and shorts gets five minutes to talk about their film and show a clip from it. Ed and producer Jonathan were first up. This is when the reality of being nominated really hits, with a sudden deluge of glamour and prompting thoughts of who you want to meet. I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll meet Spike Lee. Apparently he knows about the film. Documentaries aren\u2019t glamorous, they\u2019re often hard grinds. Yet this very personal story is now the reason behind a whirlwind of attention for me. Cameras are being shoved in my face and I\u2019m being asked questions like \u201cWhat do you want to get out of this week?\u201d The honest answer is to have a bit of a break, eat some good food, have some fun and meet some new people. That didn\u2019t seem to be the answer the camera people wanted \u2026 they\u2019d have preferred me to shout: \u201cTO WIN!\u201d We took a lot of photos with giant statues of the gold Oscar man, pulling a variety of silly (and occasionally serious) faces. There\u2019s something strange about seeing the iconic figure up close. His kitschy pose is everywhere and the more you look at it, especially on gigantic replica statues, the weirder it seems. We tried to mimic his pose \u2013 you just can\u2019t get it right. Wednesday A quieter day that meant me my girlfriend, who\u2019s here from Canada, could look for some of LA\u2019s best Nigerian food. This is a hiatus period between the end of voting and all the bigger pre-ceremony glitz. You hear about the big gifting parties, where stars are offered absurd free things and vouchers for beauty services \u2026 but those companies aren\u2019t so interested in the short documentary nominees. But we want to find a way to get some free Hollywood swag, it feels like it should be part of the Oscars experience. It was a grey day and felt like the glamour had gone away for a bit after the excitement of last night. But in the evening, we did a screening at Soho House on the Sunset Strip and got an amazing view of LA from up high. As usual, the Q&amp;A after felt emotionally intense. We were asked a lot of questions about what the film says about the state of Britain, which is a lot to ask about something that\u2019s just my own personal story. Reliving this hard experience over and over again in such short succession is really hard. We talked about how the ceremony would work and realise we didn\u2019t know who was sitting where. Then we went to the party for all the shorts nominees in a little bar. It was intimate, and a good way to speak to some non-documentary people. Thursday We know the big parties have started now because we keep reading about them \u2013 but how you get invited when you\u2019re in one of the smallest categories is another question. Polite requests to party organisers are met with a firm rebuke: no, the lists closed weeks ago. Lady Gaga probably doesn\u2019t have this trouble.

It seems that Kepa Arrizabalaga isn\u2019t cut from quite the same cloth and when the Chelsea goalkeeper was substituted by Maurizio Sarri shortly before the end of Sunday\u2019s Worthington Cup final, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/24/sarri-kepa-subsitution-chelsea-manchester-city\">he brazenly refused to leave the field</a>. As his manager Maurizio Sarri ranted, raved, kicked water bottles, gesticulated wildly and briefly threatened to storm out of the arena in a volcanic funk, Kepa stood his ground in a scarcely credible act of insubordination that would earn most workplace drones the sack for gross misconduct.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/24/kepa-chelsea-sarri-carabao-cup-final-manchester-city\">Kepa\u2019s shootout mutiny emblematic of Sarri\u2019s sinking ship at Chelsea | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sadly for Sarri, however, Kepa isn\u2019t just any old workplace drone, but one who happens to be the most expensive in his particular position, despite his passable impersonation of a hologram of himself as Sergio Ag\u00fcero took one of the penalties that would eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/24/chelsea-manchester-city-carabao-cup-match-report\">win Manchester City the cup</a>. Eager to play down their player\u2019s appalling behaviour and convey the impression their manager hadn\u2019t just suffered a very public humiliation, the Stamford Bridge branch of the politburo went into overdrive and the version of events spun to hacks in the immediate aftermath of the game bore little relationship to the events they had just seen unfold.</p> <p>\u201cIt was misunderstood,\u201d said Kepa. \u201cIn no moment was it my intention to disobey or anything like that with the boss. He thought I couldn\u2019t continue, and \u2013 fundamentally \u2013 I was trying to say that physically I was fine.\u201d Fundamentally as anything, by shouting \u201cNo!\u201d repeatedly, waving dismissively and leaving his fellow goalkeeper Willy Cabellero hanging conspicuously by the sideline like a giant fluorescent lime. \u201cIt was a big misunderstanding because I understood the keeper had cramp and was unable to go to penalties but it was not cramp and he could go to the penalties,\u201d said Sarri, whose story didn\u2019t stand up to the mildest scrutiny of anyone present and in possession of eyes.</p> <p>Having been so publicly undermined by one of his troops, commanding officer Sarri would be well within his rights to demand the soldier in question be given a dishonourable discharge by Chelsea\u2019s top brass. With the chances of that being precisely zero, it is instead the Italian who is likely to be handed his papers, among them one marked \u201cDo One\u201d before too long.

      "bodyText": "SARRI STATE OF AFFAIRS The Fiver didn\u2019t get where it is today without toeing the company line. If The Man says \u201cjump\u201d, we ask how high. If The Man says \u201cthump\u201d, we ask how hard. And if The Man says \u201cscrump\u201d, we\u2019ll make for the nearest orchard and steal every apple in sight. If attempting to ingratiate yourself with the boss through general obsequiousness, kow-towing and forelock-tugging were Olympic sports, The Fiver would be a fixture on the top step of the podium dedicating our victory to the gaffer. It seems that Kepa Arrizabalaga isn\u2019t cut from quite the same cloth and when the Chelsea goalkeeper was substituted by Maurizio Sarri shortly before the end of Sunday\u2019s Worthington Cup final, he brazenly refused to leave the field. As his manager Maurizio Sarri ranted, raved, kicked water bottles, gesticulated wildly and briefly threatened to storm out of the arena in a volcanic funk, Kepa stood his ground in a scarcely credible act of insubordination that would earn most workplace drones the sack for gross misconduct. Sadly for Sarri, however, Kepa isn\u2019t just any old workplace drone, but one who happens to be the most expensive in his particular position, despite his passable impersonation of a hologram of himself as Sergio Ag\u00fcero took one of the penalties that would eventually win Manchester City the cup. Eager to play down their player\u2019s appalling behaviour and convey the impression their manager hadn\u2019t just suffered a very public humiliation, the Stamford Bridge branch of the politburo went into overdrive and the version of events spun to hacks in the immediate aftermath of the game bore little relationship to the events they had just seen unfold. \u201cIt was misunderstood,\u201d said Kepa. \u201cIn no moment was it my intention to disobey or anything like that with the boss. He thought I couldn\u2019t continue, and \u2013 fundamentally \u2013 I was trying to say that physically I was fine.\u201d Fundamentally as anything, by shouting \u201cNo!\u201d repeatedly, waving dismissively and leaving his fellow goalkeeper Willy Cabellero hanging conspicuously by the sideline like a giant fluorescent lime. \u201cIt was a big misunderstanding because I understood the keeper had cramp and was unable to go to penalties but it was not cramp and he could go to the penalties,\u201d said Sarri, whose story didn\u2019t stand up to the mildest scrutiny of anyone present and in possession of eyes. Having been so publicly undermined by one of his troops, commanding officer Sarri would be well within his rights to demand the soldier in question be given a dishonourable discharge by Chelsea\u2019s top brass. With the chances of that being precisely zero, it is instead the Italian who is likely to be handed his papers, among them one marked \u201cDo One\u201d before too long. He may have lost his dignity, but his legacy of smoking fags, shouting a lot and being ridiculously stubborn will always endure. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI\u2019ve never come across the situation I\u2019ve got at the moment. We\u2019re having physios and medical people from abroad telling us what we can do with him when he is our player. He obviously listens to his physios, his medical people and Tom, Dick and Harry from abroad\u201d \u2013 Neil \u201cTo hell with the EU\u201d Warnock isn\u2019t a fan of Victor Camarasa\u2019s foreign medical bods, even if they have very British names. RECOMMENDED LISTENING The latest edition of Football Weekly will be somewhere around here. FIVER LETTERS \u201cReading the Fiver missive of 25 January, I caught the Sarri quote about Chelsea rediscovering their mojo after their Fizzy Cup win over Spurs \u2013 \u201cthe players had stopped having fun on the pitch\u201d honked he and The Fiver simultaneously. Surely Kepa can\u2019t be lambasted for taking his words to heart on Sunday?\u201d \u2013 Gerry Rickard. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see that Kepa has already mastered the art of the celebrity non-apology, apology with his \u201cI regret the way the end of the match has been portrayed\u201c. It seems that Elton John and Bernie Taupin were right in 1976 on their classic album Blue Moves and Sarri Seems to be the Hardest Word\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis.

Another piece of heartening news: Kosovo\u2019s games in the upcoming Under-17 European Championships have been moved from Spain to the suitably neutral Switzerland, on the basis that the Spanish government doesn\u2019t recognise \u201cthe national symbols [flag and anthem] of Kosovo.\u201d Manuel Pellegrini has bought five jumbo rolls of bubble wrap off Amazon and will use them to keep Manuel Lanzini safe from harm. \u201cWe must be careful with him,\u201d sssshhhhhed Pellegrini, about the forward who is just returning from cruciate ligament knack. Mike Dean has been redirected from fourth official duties for Tottenham\u2019s game against Chelsea on Wednesday in a bid to prevent Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino getting fresh and funky with him again. Having booked into the Do One health spa for an unspecified spell, former Leicester City manager Claude Puel resisted the urge to say \u201cGoodbye Puel world\u201d in his farewell statement and said, instead, it had been an honour. And in yet another example of the lefty liberal loony pinko lefty anti-Brexit lefty media conspiracy, the BBC has announced it will be showing England Women\u2019s SheBelieves Cup games, which starts in the USA!

Almost 30 years later, he and another father, Barry Devonside, whose son Christopher, 18, was killed at Hillsborough, gave evidence at Preston crown court on Monday at the manslaughter trial of David Duckenfield, the South Yorkshire police chief superintendent in command of the match. Hicks recalled telling a senior police officer that he could see the central \u201cpens\u201d, 3 and 4, of the Leppings Lane terrace were very full and that \u201cthings are going badly wrong\u201d. Asked by Christine Agnew QC, for the prosecution, about the officer\u2019s response, Hicks recalled: \u201cHe told me: \u2018Shut your fucking prattle.\u2019\u201d As he grew increasingly concerned, Hicks said, he saw Victoria being carried up out of pen 3.

Devonside criticised a police officer who met him at the gymnasium. \u201cHe talked to me as though I was the dirt on his shoes,\u201d Devonside said. \u201cHe more or less shouted at me.\u201d He said he spent five hours going to hospital, then to two mortuaries, before finally returning to the gymnasium at 11pm, where he identified his son. \u201cChris had been there all of that time,\u201d he said. Stephen Allen, a Liverpool fan who was a Metropolitan police officer at the time, gave evidence about the \u201cvery intense\u201d force of the crush in pen 3, people \u201cshouting in agony\u201d and screaming, then his efforts to pull people out of two piles of dead bodies at the front of the pen. Duckenfield, 74, denies gross negligence manslaughter in relation to 95 of the people who were killed. Graham Mackrell, 69, the Sheffield Wednesday club secretary and safety officer at the time of the disaster, denies breaching a condition of Hillsborough\u2019s safety certificate, and breaching a duty under the Health and Safety Act. The trial continues.",

The club that called upon Jesus Christ in jeans, a bodybuilding dwarf, a man laying an egg, a two-headed motorbike rider, Getafe Tinder, and a melancholic monster to try to fill their ground, a catalogue of commercials that didn\u2019t always succeed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/jan/25/sid-lowe-la-%20liga-getafe\">in cramming the Coliseum</a>, might just have stumbled upon the best way to pack the place: by getting teams such as Manchester City, Juventus and Bayern Munich to come to town. Bayern Munich have been here before \u2013 in the Uefa Cup a decade ago \u2013 but City haven\u2019t. Nor have Juve Inter, Liverpool or Dortmund. Because Getafe haven\u2019t been <em>here</em> before either.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, goals from Jaime Mata and Jorge Molina helped Getafe defeat Rayo Vallecano 2-1 in one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/sep/11/clasico-leganes-getafe-la-liga-spanish-football\">first division\u2019s 20 Madrid derbies</a> to go fourth. It was early and there were other games to come, the chance to lose that place, but by the end of the weekend Getafe were still there and by the end of the season, they might be too: Sevilla, beaten by Barcelona, are two points behind and slipping, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/03/sevilla-pablo-%20machin-la-liga\">no longer competitors</a>; Valencia, who have drawn 15 times, are six points behind; Real Betis trail by three; and no one expected Alav\u00e9s, just two points off, to be there then or to stay there now. Abelardo Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s team are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/oct/08/alaves-beautiful-madness-real-madrid-pressure-julen-lopetegui-la-liga-football\">this season\u2019s great overachievers</a> \u2013 or they would be if it wasn\u2019t for Getafe.</p> \n<p>Getafe have the division\u2019s third smallest average attendance at 9,874, only above Eibar (5,416) <a href=\"https://www.marca.com/futbol/primera-division/2018/12/28/5c23c01f46163fcdb98b458d.html\">and Huesca (4,733)</a>, and most people ignore them, when they\u2019re not sneering at them. On Saturday one of the two big non-sports newspapers didn\u2019t bother sending a match reporter \u2013 perhaps it was too far away \u2013 while the other gave it barely 100 words, but this is huge.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1099285617895239681\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">| GOAL! | <br><br>Jaime Mata opens the scoring for Getafe! <br><br>Nine goals in his last 12 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LaLiga?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LaLiga</a> games \ud83d\udd25 <a href=\"https://t.co/oITID1TLo7\">pic.twitter.com/oITID1TLo7</a></p>\u2014 Eleven Sports (@ElevenSports_UK) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1099285617895239681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 23, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1099300202324873218\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">| GOAL! | <br><br>Getafe are back in front! <br><br>Fine work from Portillo sent Mata through, who squared for Molina \ud83d\udc4f <a href=\"https://t.co/0pt7iJMSyn\">pic.twitter.com/0pt7iJMSyn</a></p>\u2014 Eleven Sports (@ElevenSports_UK) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1099300202324873218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 23, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>All 11 of Getafe\u2019s players on Saturday \u2013 all 13, counting the substitutes \u2013 cost \u20ac4.2m and over half of that went on a single player, Dakonam Djene. Lionel Messi makes almost that much in a month. And they have the sixth smallest salary limit in La Liga, at \u20ac39.25m. That\u2019s a budget one <em>16th</em> of Barcelona\u2019s, at \u20ac632.97m. Madrid\u2019s limit is \u20ac566.53m, Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s \u20ac293m, Valencia\u2019s \u20ac164.69m, Sevilla\u2019s \u20ac163m and Villarreal\u2019s \u20ac109m. You have to go down another 10 teams to reach Getafe in that table.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to Europe,\u201d the fans chanted as the final minutes slipped away. Some of their players have been there before, if only for a handful of games, but this is not a team built to be where it is. More of Getafe\u2019s players have experience of relegation than Europe and most have played more seasons in the second division than the first. Their goalkeeper, David Soria, wasn\u2019t wanted by Sevilla; centre-back Leandro Cabrera joined from relegation-bound Cotrone in Italy; right back Damian Su\u00e1rez arrived off the back of two relegations in a row; central midfielder Nemanja Maksimovic wasn\u2019t wanted by Valencia and, alongside him, Flamini didn\u2019t have a team. To their right, Dimitri Foulquier spent last season at Granada, Watford <em>and</em> Strasbourg. And as for their strike force, Mata is playing his first season in <em>Primera</em> and most people thought that 36-year-old Molina had definitively left his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/21/jorge-%20molina-road-to-verge-europe-getafe-la-liga\">first division days behind him</a>.</p> \n<p>Their manager, Jose Bordal\u00e1s, has been coaching for 25 years but he is in only his second season in <em>Primera</em>. He took Alcorc\u00f3n to the play-offs and Alav\u00e9s to promotion but, much like many of his players, he was seen as a man who was all well and good in the second division but not suited to the first and it wasn\u2019t until he brought Getafe up that he had the chance to compete in <em>Primera</em> himself. Once there, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/04/jose-bordalas-brings-%20life-to-getafe-as-intense-approach-reaps-rewards\">he proved those prejudices wrong</a>: when he took over, Getafe were second bottom of the second division, but they went up, finished eighth in their first season and are now fourth. This is the best Getafe in history, and Molina has become the oldest player to reach 10 league goals since Ferenc Puskas.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Put bluntly, opponents testify to how bloody hard it is to beat them</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>No wonder Getafe\u2019s fans again chanted for Molina <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/21/jorge-molina-road-to-%20verge-europe-getafe-la-liga\">to get a Spain call-up</a>, but it\u2019s not just him; it\u2019s all of them. This is a team defined by solidity and solidarity. There was something about the way that Mata, who had scored a brilliant first and was sent clean through by a wonderful pass from Francisco Portillo, rolled the ball into Molina to score the second which summed it up. They both have 10 now: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OptaJose/status/1099303091059523587\">no Spaniard has more</a>. \u201cThere are no egos in this team,\u201d Molina insisted afterwards. And, asked if he would pick Molina for Spain, Antunes replied: \u201cIf I was the national team manager, I\u2019d take the entire Getafe squad. You don\u2019t get to see it, but the soul that we put into every session is the <em>hostia</em>.\u201d The <em>hostia</em> is the holy host, the consecrated bread: the business, in other words. Unbelievable. Which neatly defines what this team are doing.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe work to the limit, and you can see that in the games: we play the way we train,\u201d Antunes added. In games, you see the influence of a manager for whom, as one player puts it, every defeat is a \u201cdeath\u201d: intelligent, analytical and exceptionally demanding. His team is tough, aggressive, direct, everyone clear about their role. But there has been a growing irritation at Getafe over suggestions that they\u2019re dirty, masters of the dark arts, and they have good reason to feel that way: there\u2019s much more to it, greater variety than many admit. \u201cA team of thugs doesn\u2019t reach sixth in the league,\u201d <a href=\"https://elpais.com/deportes/2019/01/25/actualidad/1548417350_368152.html\">Jorge Molina said</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"307647a27665533ab3f1d82a554012d91bc6aa39\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/307647a27665533ab3f1d82a554012d91bc6aa39/0_226_5760_3457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Getafe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rayo Vallecano\u2019s defender Jordi Amat is closed down by Jaime Mata, left, and Damian Su\u00e1rez of Getafe.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: V\u00edctor Lerena/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>They don\u2019t reach fourth, either. It was a month ago when Molina said that and Getafe are even higher now. \u201cToo good,\u201d Mata called it. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this, that\u2019s for sure. Bordal\u00e1s\u2019s contract doesn\u2019t include a bonus for reaching the Champions League: no one thought it necessary. And yet it is a genuine possibility now. The season is two-thirds of the way in and there was something about the way they won this game that suggests they can hold on: a security about them, a sense of control. Put bluntly, opponents testify to how bloody hard it is to beat them.</p> \n<p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m dreaming of Europe; who wouldn\u2019t be?\u201d Antunes said. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t achieved anything yet, not even survival.\u201d Like his full-back, a 31-year-old signed for \u20ac500,000 from Dynamo Kyiv, another footballer recovered for the cause and the third most expensive player on the pitch this weekend, Bordal\u00e1s was trying not to get carried away. But he couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cWe have 39 points; that\u2019s a lot of points,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go and we know there are teams with far, far greater potential than ours.

He also provided a superb, soft assist for Luis Su\u00e1rez to score the fourth.

      "bodyText": "Die meister, die besten, les grandes equipes, the Getafe?! You can almost hear the needle scratch. It is 13 years since Mathieu Flamini played in a Champions League final but he might get the chance to play in the competition again. The man who helped find a way of turning waste into renewable energy has helped turn Getafe into one of the best teams on the continent. Just over a year after turning up for a trial, a 33-year-old biochemical pioneer released by Crystal Palace who hadn\u2019t played football for six months, the former Arsenal midfielder could be returning to the biggest stage of all \u2013 and with the most unlikely of clubs. Just look at the league table. Now look again. Yes, that really is Getafe in a Champions League place. Not even the Zombie Porn got them this excited. The club that called upon Jesus Christ in jeans, a bodybuilding dwarf, a man laying an egg, a two-headed motorbike rider, Getafe Tinder, and a melancholic monster to try to fill their ground, a catalogue of commercials that didn\u2019t always succeed in cramming the Coliseum, might just have stumbled upon the best way to pack the place: by getting teams such as Manchester City, Juventus and Bayern Munich to come to town. Bayern Munich have been here before \u2013 in the Uefa Cup a decade ago \u2013 but City haven\u2019t. Nor have Juve Inter, Liverpool or Dortmund. Because Getafe haven\u2019t been here before either. On Saturday, goals from Jaime Mata and Jorge Molina helped Getafe defeat Rayo Vallecano 2-1 in one of the first division\u2019s 20 Madrid derbies to go fourth. It was early and there were other games to come, the chance to lose that place, but by the end of the weekend Getafe were still there and by the end of the season, they might be too: Sevilla, beaten by Barcelona, are two points behind and slipping, no longer competitors; Valencia, who have drawn 15 times, are six points behind; Real Betis trail by three; and no one expected Alav\u00e9s, just two points off, to be there then or to stay there now. Abelardo Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s team are this season\u2019s great overachievers \u2013 or they would be if it wasn\u2019t for Getafe. Getafe have the division\u2019s third smallest average attendance at 9,874, only above Eibar (5,416) and Huesca (4,733), and most people ignore them, when they\u2019re not sneering at them. On Saturday one of the two big non-sports newspapers didn\u2019t bother sending a match reporter \u2013 perhaps it was too far away \u2013 while the other gave it barely 100 words, but this is huge. All 11 of Getafe\u2019s players on Saturday \u2013 all 13, counting the substitutes \u2013 cost \u20ac4.2m and over half of that went on a single player, Dakonam Djene. Lionel Messi makes almost that much in a month. And they have the sixth smallest salary limit in La Liga, at \u20ac39.25m. That\u2019s a budget one 16th of Barcelona\u2019s, at \u20ac632.97m. Madrid\u2019s limit is \u20ac566.53m, Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s \u20ac293m, Valencia\u2019s \u20ac164.69m, Sevilla\u2019s \u20ac163m and Villarreal\u2019s \u20ac109m. You have to go down another 10 teams to reach Getafe in that table. \u201cWe\u2019re going to Europe,\u201d the fans chanted as the final minutes slipped away. Some of their players have been there before, if only for a handful of games, but this is not a team built to be where it is. More of Getafe\u2019s players have experience of relegation than Europe and most have played more seasons in the second division than the first. Their goalkeeper, David Soria, wasn\u2019t wanted by Sevilla; centre-back Leandro Cabrera joined from relegation-bound Cotrone in Italy; right back Damian Su\u00e1rez arrived off the back of two relegations in a row; central midfielder Nemanja Maksimovic wasn\u2019t wanted by Valencia and, alongside him, Flamini didn\u2019t have a team. To their right, Dimitri Foulquier spent last season at Granada, Watford and Strasbourg. And as for their strike force, Mata is playing his first season in Primera and most people thought that 36-year-old Molina had definitively left his first division days behind him. Their manager, Jose Bordal\u00e1s, has been coaching for 25 years but he is in only his second season in Primera. He took Alcorc\u00f3n to the play-offs and Alav\u00e9s to promotion but, much like many of his players, he was seen as a man who was all well and good in the second division but not suited to the first and it wasn\u2019t until he brought Getafe up that he had the chance to compete in Primera himself. Once there, he proved those prejudices wrong: when he took over, Getafe were second bottom of the second division, but they went up, finished eighth in their first season and are now fourth. This is the best Getafe in history, and Molina has become the oldest player to reach 10 league goals since Ferenc Puskas. No wonder Getafe\u2019s fans again chanted for Molina to get a Spain call-up, but it\u2019s not just him; it\u2019s all of them. This is a team defined by solidity and solidarity. There was something about the way that Mata, who had scored a brilliant first and was sent clean through by a wonderful pass from Francisco Portillo, rolled the ball into Molina to score the second which summed it up. They both have 10 now: no Spaniard has more. \u201cThere are no egos in this team,\u201d Molina insisted afterwards. And, asked if he would pick Molina for Spain, Antunes replied: \u201cIf I was the national team manager, I\u2019d take the entire Getafe squad. You don\u2019t get to see it, but the soul that we put into every session is the hostia.\u201d The hostia is the holy host, the consecrated bread: the business, in other words. Unbelievable. Which neatly defines what this team are doing. \u201cWe work to the limit, and you can see that in the games: we play the way we train,\u201d Antunes added. In games, you see the influence of a manager for whom, as one player puts it, every defeat is a \u201cdeath\u201d: intelligent, analytical and exceptionally demanding. His team is tough, aggressive, direct, everyone clear about their role. But there has been a growing irritation at Getafe over suggestions that they\u2019re dirty, masters of the dark arts, and they have good reason to feel that way: there\u2019s much more to it, greater variety than many admit. \u201cA team of thugs doesn\u2019t reach sixth in the league,\u201d Jorge Molina said. They don\u2019t reach fourth, either. It was a month ago when Molina said that and Getafe are even higher now. \u201cToo good,\u201d Mata called it. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this, that\u2019s for sure. Bordal\u00e1s\u2019s contract doesn\u2019t include a bonus for reaching the Champions League: no one thought it necessary. And yet it is a genuine possibility now. The season is two-thirds of the way in and there was something about the way they won this game that suggests they can hold on: a security about them, a sense of control. Put bluntly, opponents testify to how bloody hard it is to beat them. \u201cOf course I\u2019m dreaming of Europe; who wouldn\u2019t be?\u201d Antunes said. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t achieved anything yet, not even survival.\u201d Like his full-back, a 31-year-old signed for \u20ac500,000 from Dynamo Kyiv, another footballer recovered for the cause and the third most expensive player on the pitch this weekend, Bordal\u00e1s was trying not to get carried away. But he couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cWe have 39 points; that\u2019s a lot of points,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go and we know there are teams with far, far greater potential than ours. We lack things that other teams have but we make up for that by competing and enjoying it. We\u2019re making a lot of people happy: no one thought we would be here. In football good moments come around only rarely, and our fans have had bad moments, so let them dream. You should always dream.\u201d Talking points \u2022 Lionel Messi scored his 50th hat-trick, going all the way back to this one 12 years ago. He also provided a superb, soft assist for Luis Su\u00e1rez to score the fourth. He carried a not-all-that-good Barcelona to victory at the Sanchez Pizju\u00e1n, and in doing so he might just have carried them to another league title. Not quite single-handed, but about as single-handed as it gets. \u2022 \u00c1lvaro Morata stuck his finger in his ear, drew a TV screen with his fingers and, giggling, called for the VAR. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know if we could celebrate,\u201d Diego Simeone admitted afterwards, but Morata already was, his tongue wedged in his cheek. \u2022 Levante were good, but lost. Real Madrid were not, but won. They got two penalties, the second so surreal as to be almost funny. Casemiro took off, untouched, and \u201cwon\u201d the penalty. Gareth Bale took it, scored, and refused to be touched. \u2022 The assist for Huesca\u2019s equaliser at Espanyol. Woof!",

Students are expected to lead fresh demonstrations on Tuesday after several days of angry protests that began on Friday when tens of thousands of people took to the streets in towns and villages across the country, including the capital. It is rare for protests to be tolerated by authorities, particularly in Algiers, where demonstrations have been banned since 2001. On Sunday, hundreds of people demonstrated in Algiers as police sprayed teargas, brought in water cannon and rounded up protesters, an AFP journalist on the ground reported. State radio journalists complained of a blackout imposed on media coverage. Bouteflika, 81, has been in office since 1999, but he is in ill-health and has been seen in public only a handful of times since suffering a stroke in 2013.

Policed fired teargas to block a march on the presidential palace in Algiers, prompting demonstrators to respond by throwing stones, international news agencies reported. State media have been silent on the protests and national radio journalists at the weekend complained they were being prevented from reporting on the opposition to Bouteflika. In an unsigned letter to management, they attacked the \u201cdecision by the hierarchy to ignore\u201d the rallies and deplored the skewing of coverage in favour of the president.

The previous highest recorded temperature in February had been 19.7C in London in 1998.</p> <p>It is the first time temperatures have exceed 20C during winter, according to a Met Office official.

She added: \u201cI like spending an afternoon in the sunshine as much as anyone, but it\u2019s impossible to shake the feeling that this isn\u2019t right.

      "bodyText": "The UK is experiencing its warmest February day on record and some of the highest temperatures ever recorded in winter, according to forecasters. Temperatures in Trawsgoed, Wales, reached 20.3C, (68.5F) on Monday morning and rose to 20.6C in the afternoon. The previous highest recorded temperature in February had been 19.7C in London in 1998. It is the first time temperatures have exceed 20C during winter, according to a Met Office official. The weather starkly contrasts with the beginning of the month, when sub-zero temperatures were recorded across the country. The Met Office\u2019s chief meteorologist, Steve Willington, emphasised that the gap was notable, saying: \u201cBy the weekend we could see temperatures almost 10 degrees higher than what we might normally expect at this time of year, so there will certainly be a spring-like feel in the air across the country. \u201cNorth-western parts of the UK will be wet and windy at times this week, but settled conditions will spread to all parts of the country by the weekend, bringing plenty of sunshine and unseasonably mild temperatures that could well compete with current February temperature records.\u201d Responding to the Met Office reports, the Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, said the warmer temperatures were concerning. She added: \u201cI like spending an afternoon in the sunshine as much as anyone, but it\u2019s impossible to shake the feeling that this isn\u2019t right. After last year\u2019s unprecedented global heatwave and last month\u2019s deadly temperatures in Australia, our baseline perception of what\u2019s normal is shifting. \u201cWe are living through climate breakdown and, instead of taking urgent action, ministers carry on as if nothing has changed. The government must wake up to this crisis, urgently declare a climate emergency and introduce a \u2018Green New Deal\u2019 to provide a green job to everyone who wants one and transform our economy to prevent climate catastrophe.\u201d A Met Office representative said that temperatures in Wales were affected by local geography, with southerly winds rising over the east of the Welsh mountains and warming while descending down the other side in west Wales. The country is experiencing warmer temperatures in general this week. London reached 19.8C on Monday \u2013 also the highest temperature recorded in February since records began. This time last year there was widespread snowfall across the country between late February and March and some areas of the country were hit by blizzards. Bob Ward, of the centre for climate change economics and policy at the London School of Economics, said that while warmer temperatures are often welcomed, they can be deadly. \u201cPeople may find it very pleasant to be in warmer temperatures but they must also remember that it\u2019s the same trend that saw hundreds of people die last summer as a result of overheating. \u201cOver the last five years we also had two record wet winters during which there was severe flooding.

The North Korean\u2019s leader\u2019s moratorium on testing began even before the two leaders\u2019 first summit in Singapore last June, and followed the successful test of a thermonuclear weapon and two launches of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in 2017.

Although the majority decision by the international court of justice in The Hague is only advisory, the unambiguous clarity of the judges\u2019 pronouncement is a humiliating blow to Britain\u2019s prestige on the world stage. The case was referred to the court, which hears legal submissions over international boundary disputes, after an overwhelming vote in 2017 in the UN assembly in the face of fierce opposition from a largely isolated UK. Delivering judgment, the president of the ICJ, Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf, said the detachment of the Chagos archipelago in 1965 from Mauritius had not been based on a \u201cfree and genuine expression of the people concerned\u201d. \u201cThis continued administration constitutes a wrongful act,\u201d he added. \u201cThe UK has an obligation to bring to an end its administration of the Chagos archipelago as rapidly as possible and that all member states must co-operate with the United Nations to complete the decolonization of Mauritius.\u201d Judge Yusuf, who is a Somali, said the process of separating the Chagos Islands from Mauritius during decolonisation in the 1960s constituted an \u201cunlawful detachment\u201d and was a \u201cwrongful act\u201d.

The UN general assembly is now expected to deal with the question of the resettlement of the Chagos Islanders who have been expelled. The judgment represents a significant defeat for the UK on virtually every point it contested in the hearing last September. By a majority of 13 to one, the court found that the decolonisation of Mauritius had not been lawfully completed and that it must be completed \u201cas rapidly as possible\u201d.

It would be presumptuous to guess the reaction of Gordon Banks, were he still alive, to the behaviour of Kepa Arrizabalaga in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday but it\u2019s hard to imagine any footballer of his generation not being appalled by the young Basque\u2019s display of insubordination, for which he belatedly apologised on Monday evening.</p> \n<p>It is not just the orientation of the Wembley pitch from north-south to east-west that has been radically modified since Banks enjoyed his finest hour on the turf now so arrogantly desecrated by Arrizabalaga\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/24/sarri-kepa-subsitution-chelsea-manchester-city\" title=\"\">refusal to accept his substitution</a>. Chelsea\u2019s payment of \u00a371.6m to bring the 24-year-old to the Premier League, and the wages of \u00a370m that he is due to receive over the seven years of his contract, belong to a different planet from the one inhabited by a man whose career began in the era of the \u00a320 maximum wage.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/24/kepa-chelsea-sarri-carabao-cup-final-manchester-city\">Kepa\u2019s shootout mutiny emblematic of Sarri\u2019s sinking ship at Chelsea | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is possible to have some sympathy for the psychological strain imposed on young men set apart by sudden wealth without feeling that it can be used to justify Arrizabalaga\u2019s response to seeing the electronic board with his number on it in the closing moments of extra time against Manchester City. Link that to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/22/maurizio-sarri-chelsea-bell-tolls-carabao-cup-manchester-city\" title=\"\">problems behind the scenes</a> at Stamford Bridge, and the crescendo of questions about the squad\u2019s faith in their head coach, and you have the ingredients of a belief that he could face down authority and get away with it.</p> \n<p>Nobody comes well out of this except the referee, whose remit does not extend to enforcing a manager\u2019s wishes on the field. Jon Moss allowed the sudden conflagration to burn itself out, and then got on with a shootout, which almost came as an anticlimax.</p> \n<p>You could say that if Arrizabalaga felt he was not injured badly enough to prevent him taking part in the shootout, then he had every right to insist on continuing to do the job for which he had been picked. (Afterwards he compounded the offence by claiming that he had exaggerated his injury in order to give his team a respite). But not every substitution \u2013 these days, not even the majority \u2013 is enforced by injury. The system was introduced to avoid something like Roy Dwight\u2019s broken leg reducing Nottingham Forest to 10 men early in the 1959 FA Cup final, but it evolved long ago into a sophisticated weapon of tactical rearrangement. And why should what goes for, say, a playmaker be any different for a goalkeeper?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dc854b1a-10dc-499a-a8e0-9af12d09dc63\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gRct77aJ4Co?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Had Maurizio Sarri always planned to bring on Willy Caballero for the shootout, it would have made very good sense. The Argentinian keeper saved three penalties for Manchester City against Liverpool in the final of the same competition three years ago, and after moving to Chelsea he saved the first penalty in a successful shootout against Norwich City in the FA Cup third round last season.

      "bodyText": "Just two weeks ago we were mourning the death of England\u2019s greatest goalkeeper, a man who did his job without fuss. It would be presumptuous to guess the reaction of Gordon Banks, were he still alive, to the behaviour of Kepa Arrizabalaga in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday but it\u2019s hard to imagine any footballer of his generation not being appalled by the young Basque\u2019s display of insubordination, for which he belatedly apologised on Monday evening. It is not just the orientation of the Wembley pitch from north-south to east-west that has been radically modified since Banks enjoyed his finest hour on the turf now so arrogantly desecrated by Arrizabalaga\u2019s refusal to accept his substitution. Chelsea\u2019s payment of \u00a371.6m to bring the 24-year-old to the Premier League, and the wages of \u00a370m that he is due to receive over the seven years of his contract, belong to a different planet from the one inhabited by a man whose career began in the era of the \u00a320 maximum wage. It is possible to have some sympathy for the psychological strain imposed on young men set apart by sudden wealth without feeling that it can be used to justify Arrizabalaga\u2019s response to seeing the electronic board with his number on it in the closing moments of extra time against Manchester City. Link that to the problems behind the scenes at Stamford Bridge, and the crescendo of questions about the squad\u2019s faith in their head coach, and you have the ingredients of a belief that he could face down authority and get away with it. Nobody comes well out of this except the referee, whose remit does not extend to enforcing a manager\u2019s wishes on the field. Jon Moss allowed the sudden conflagration to burn itself out, and then got on with a shootout, which almost came as an anticlimax. You could say that if Arrizabalaga felt he was not injured badly enough to prevent him taking part in the shootout, then he had every right to insist on continuing to do the job for which he had been picked. (Afterwards he compounded the offence by claiming that he had exaggerated his injury in order to give his team a respite). But not every substitution \u2013 these days, not even the majority \u2013 is enforced by injury. The system was introduced to avoid something like Roy Dwight\u2019s broken leg reducing Nottingham Forest to 10 men early in the 1959 FA Cup final, but it evolved long ago into a sophisticated weapon of tactical rearrangement. And why should what goes for, say, a playmaker be any different for a goalkeeper? Had Maurizio Sarri always planned to bring on Willy Caballero for the shootout, it would have made very good sense. The Argentinian keeper saved three penalties for Manchester City against Liverpool in the final of the same competition three years ago, and after moving to Chelsea he saved the first penalty in a successful shootout against Norwich City in the FA Cup third round last season. During his time as a City player Caballero would have become familiar with the penalty\u2011taking habits of many of Chelsea\u2019s opponents on Sunday. That alone would have been a valid reason for bringing him on at the end of extra time, even though Arrizabalaga had helped Chelsea to keep a clean sheet for 120 minutes. Football, particularly as conceived by men such as Sarri and Pep Guardiola, who watched events with amazement from the other dugout, is increasingly about the identification and deployment of specialised talents. But since the young goalkeeper had twice required treatment, apparently for cramp, in the closing stages of extra time, there seemed to be no other decision to be made. Many years ago, Goalkeepers Are Crazy was the title of a collection of Brian Glanville\u2019s football-themed short stories.

The second, and more important, would be that his little psychodrama disrupted his teammates\u2019 focus in a moment when at least five of them would need every ounce of available coolness.

Only those very close to her, including her highly supportive family, knew that she identified as a woman.

Shane wasn\u2019t ready to tour or to appear on TV. And because she had been out of the limelight so long, and was unschooled in the ways of modern media, her record company suggested she do only a handful of interviews. I was lucky enough to conduct <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/23/trans-pioneer-jackie-shane-i-dont-bow-down-i-do-not-get-down-on-my-knees\">one for the Guardian</a>. As interviews go, it was both fascinating and strange. Going in, there were ground rules. All her interviews were to be done on the phone, and they were to last no more than half an hour. While that first edict held, the second did not. We wound up talking for more than twice the allotted time, a good thing considering the fact that, for a while, I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to get her to answer a single question. The \u201cinterview\u201d began with a long, out-of-nowhere speech, in which she railed against drugs and the coarseness of human behavior in general. She was barreling ahead, listening to her own inner voice. I felt shut out, and resentful, but, as her speech ran on, I began to understand the likely cause. Imagine the gut confidence it took to be Jackie Shane. Imagine how much of the world\u2019s ignorance and noise you have to shut out, and how strong in yourself you have to be to do so. In that light, her distance seemed logical, if not inevitable. I\u2019m also happy to report that, after about 15 minutes, she began to let my questions in, answering them with candor and conviction. Throughout our talk, it was clear that her boldness \u2013 partly a strategy, partly a product of her gifts \u2013 had served her well. \u201cEven in school, the other kids accepted me,\u201d she said. \u201cSo did their parents. There was something about me that drew them in.\u201d</p> <p>She credited her confidence to her grandparents and to her mother. \u201cThey understood me,\u201d she said, adding the caveat that \u201csome adults were afraid of me because I was intelligent. I thought for myself.\u201d</p> <p>Her brio even allowed her to stand up to the less enlightened teachings of her local church, where she began performing as a child. \u201cI told them, I will sing, but when the minister comes on to do his bit, I leave,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d</p> <p>Shane joined her first secular band at 13 as a drummer before moving to lead vocals. Eventually, racism caused her to leave the Jim Crow south. \u201cOther entertainers told me: \u2018You\u2019ll never make it here,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cYou have talent, you\u2019re attractive.

By the early 60s, they were regulars on the club-packed Yonge Street of Toronto. On YouTube, you can see a choice Shane performance from that era of Walkin\u2019 The Dog on a TV show named Night Train. Her demeanor is courtly, her delivery cleverly measured. A representative from the all-powerful Ed Sullivan show was impressed enough to ask her to appear there, but Shane turned them down flat. \u201cHis scout came and said: \u2018You\u2019re going to have to do this without makeup,\u2019\u201d she explained. \u201cI said: \u2018Please stuff it.\u2019 Ed Sullivan looks like something Dr Frankenstein had a hand in. He\u2019s going to tell me what to do?\u201d</p> <p>She also turned away Berry Gordy and the folks at Atlantic. \u201cI\u2019ve never really wanted to record,\u201d she told me. \u201cI get my charge from performing in front of people. That\u2019s my energy.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, most of her recordings were cut live. Her in-concert covers of songs such as Cruel, Cruel World and Money display a rich vibrato, which can sound like Nina Simone, and a tense shout, worthy of prime Michael Jackson. She also proved herself a master at extended stage patter. In one long, and hilarious, speech she talked about stepping out with some chicken (a well-known term in the gay world for a young lover). Even so, the pronouns she used to address her romantic partners in the songs were those of women, something that would have provided vital cover at the time, even in the most accepting environments.

He also said that he hoped that she would perform in the next year. Shane told me she wanted to do so as well, but she was very concerned about doing it right.</p> <p>That was the only time I felt a flash of doubt cross her mind.</p> <p>It\u2019s sad that Shane will never get the chance to perform in an era when she was being recognized as a retroactive role model.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/25/karren-brady-quits-chair-philip-green-taveta\">Karren Brady</a> has succeeded in arenas dominated by largely unreconstructed men. She is widely referred to as the \u201cfirst lady of football\u201d for her quarter-of-a-century career running Birmingham City and then West Ham United. A supporter of David Cameron and George Osborne, the 49-year-old is one of just 206 women in the House of Lords (out of a total of 783 peers).</p> <p>She has also famously advised Lord Sugar on The Apprentice, as well as Simon Cowell and the former pornographer David Sullivan. It was Sullivan who gave Brady her first big break in 1993 when she convinced him to buy Birmingham City out of receivership. He installed her as chief executive when she was just 23, but told her she would have to be twice as good as a man to run the club, to which Brady replied: \u201cWell that\u2019s not difficult.\u201d</p> <p>During her first press conference at Birmingham, she was asked for her vital statistics.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/apr/10/1\"> </a>And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/apr/10/1\">early on at the club</a>, a player commented: \u201cI can see your tits in that shirt.\u201d Brady replied: \u201cWell, don\u2019t worry, when I sell you to Crewe you won\u2019t be able to see them from there, will you?\u201d. Three days later she sold him. \u201cIt was the best deal I ever did,\u201d she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/25/karren-brady-ive-never-walked-away-from-anything-and-im-not-going-to-start-now\">told the Guardian last year</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/25/karren-brady-quits-chair-philip-green-taveta\">Karren Brady quits as chair of Philip Green\u2019s retail group</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1997 she became the youngest boss of a listed UK company when Birmingham City floated on the London Stock Exchange. Sullivan bought the club for \u00a3700,000 in 1993, and sold it for \u00a382m in 2009. Much of Brady\u2019s wealth is thought to date back to the sale of the club. By the time she left, 75% of senior management at the club were women.</p> <p>She moved to West Ham, where she is vice-chair under the owners Sullivan and David Gold. Rumours have suggested she is actually an Arsenal supporter, but Brady\u2019s website says she \u201cis not an Arsenal fan, and her footballing loyalties have only ever lay with the two clubs she has represented\u201d.</p> <p>Brady grew up in Edmonton, north London, near Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s ground. Her Irish father, Terry, was a self-made Rolls-Royce-driving millionaire, having worked in property and printing. Her Italian mother, Rita, was a full-time mum. She was sent to an all-girls\u2019 Catholic boarding school, which she hated. \u201cYou do what you\u2019re told, you wear what you\u2019re told, you eat what you\u2019re told, you go to bed when you\u2019re told,\u201d she said last year. \u201cI was sick of being told what to do. The one thing I wanted was independence. And I realised to have that independence, you needed financial independence.\u201d After passing nine O-levels, she left to join the sixth form of a former all-boys\u2019 school \u2013 one of only six girls.</p> <p>A lifelong Conservative supporter, Brady introduced the then chancellor George Osborne at the Tory party conference in 2013. She was subsequently appointed as the government\u2019s small business ambassador. A year later she became a Conservative life peer. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bit like any industry that has never marketed itself to women,\u201d she has said of politics. \u201cA bit like football.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time she built up a series of business interests, including in 2017 accepting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Philip_Green\" title=\"Sir Philip Green\">Sir Philip Green</a>\u2019s offer to become chair of his family\u2019s Taveta Investments company, which owns <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_Group\" title=\"Arcadia Group\">Arcadia Group</a> including the Topshop and Miss Selfridge brands. Her brief was to \u201cbeef up corporate oversight\u201d and \u201csort out\u201d corporate governance issues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a <a href=\"http://www.karrenbrady.com/\">vocal campaigner for women in business</a>, Brady has come under increasing pressure to speak out over allegations of racial and sexual harassment made against Green. He denies the allegations. Dragons Den\u2019s Duncan Bannatyne has described her continued employment at Taveta as \u201cdisgusting\u201d.</p> <p>Two weeks ago Brady said she would stay at the company out of duty to Arcadia\u2019s employees, including her daughter <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/5542290/karren-brady-daughter-sophia-peschisolido-model-age/\">Sophia Peschisolido</a>, who is a model. \u201cI hope you would agree that walking away is the easy thing to do; staying in the role and ensuring the company is robust going forward is much harder,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Brady, who writes a weekly column for the Sun and tweets using the account <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karren_brady?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Lady Karren Brady</a>, has not commented on her decision to stand down from Taveta.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Karren Brady has succeeded in arenas dominated by largely unreconstructed men. She is widely referred to as the \u201cfirst lady of football\u201d for her quarter-of-a-century career running Birmingham City and then West Ham United. A supporter of David Cameron and George Osborne, the 49-year-old is one of just 206 women in the House of Lords (out of a total of 783 peers). She has also famously advised Lord Sugar on The Apprentice, as well as Simon Cowell and the former pornographer David Sullivan. It was Sullivan who gave Brady her first big break in 1993 when she convinced him to buy Birmingham City out of receivership. He installed her as chief executive when she was just 23, but told her she would have to be twice as good as a man to run the club, to which Brady replied: \u201cWell that\u2019s not difficult.\u201d During her first press conference at Birmingham, she was asked for her vital statistics. And early on at the club, a player commented: \u201cI can see your tits in that shirt.\u201d Brady replied: \u201cWell, don\u2019t worry, when I sell you to Crewe you won\u2019t be able to see them from there, will you?\u201d. Three days later she sold him. \u201cIt was the best deal I ever did,\u201d she told the Guardian last year. In 1997 she became the youngest boss of a listed UK company when Birmingham City floated on the London Stock Exchange. Sullivan bought the club for \u00a3700,000 in 1993, and sold it for \u00a382m in 2009. Much of Brady\u2019s wealth is thought to date back to the sale of the club. By the time she left, 75% of senior management at the club were women. She moved to West Ham, where she is vice-chair under the owners Sullivan and David Gold. Rumours have suggested she is actually an Arsenal supporter, but Brady\u2019s website says she \u201cis not an Arsenal fan, and her footballing loyalties have only ever lay with the two clubs she has represented\u201d. Brady grew up in Edmonton, north London, near Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s ground. Her Irish father, Terry, was a self-made Rolls-Royce-driving millionaire, having worked in property and printing. Her Italian mother, Rita, was a full-time mum. She was sent to an all-girls\u2019 Catholic boarding school, which she hated. \u201cYou do what you\u2019re told, you wear what you\u2019re told, you eat what you\u2019re told, you go to bed when you\u2019re told,\u201d she said last year. \u201cI was sick of being told what to do. The one thing I wanted was independence. And I realised to have that independence, you needed financial independence.\u201d After passing nine O-levels, she left to join the sixth form of a former all-boys\u2019 school \u2013 one of only six girls. A lifelong Conservative supporter, Brady introduced the then chancellor George Osborne at the Tory party conference in 2013. She was subsequently appointed as the government\u2019s small business ambassador. A year later she became a Conservative life peer. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bit like any industry that has never marketed itself to women,\u201d she has said of politics. \u201cA bit like football.\u201d At the same time she built up a series of business interests, including in 2017 accepting Sir Philip Green\u2019s offer to become chair of his family\u2019s Taveta Investments company, which owns Arcadia Group including the Topshop and Miss Selfridge brands. Her brief was to \u201cbeef up corporate oversight\u201d and \u201csort out\u201d corporate governance issues. As a vocal campaigner for women in business, Brady has come under increasing pressure to speak out over allegations of racial and sexual harassment made against Green. He denies the allegations. Dragons Den\u2019s Duncan Bannatyne has described her continued employment at Taveta as \u201cdisgusting\u201d. Two weeks ago Brady said she would stay at the company out of duty to Arcadia\u2019s employees, including her daughter Sophia Peschisolido, who is a model. \u201cI hope you would agree that walking away is the easy thing to do; staying in the role and ensuring the company is robust going forward is much harder,\u201d she said. Brady, who writes a weekly column for the Sun and tweets using the account Lady Karren Brady, has not commented on her decision to stand down from Taveta.",

Anti-hero Comstock &amp; posh friend Ravelston are like old friends now and it\u2019s always a pleasure to \u201cmeet up\u201d with them again. I first read it when I was a little younger than Gordon is in the book and, like him, felt \u201crather moth-eaten\u201d even back then. I\u2019m still not sure, come the end, if I feel happy for him or not, but sure as hell always enjoy the journey on the way there.

However, using prose that is terse and bullet hard, Beverly creates a novel that is more than a tale of gangsters on a road trip but that explores an America that is alien to its inhabitants. I really enjoyed this book, becoming increasingly involved in the story of the protagonist, East, a young man starting to discover the person that he wants to be and the life that he wants to live. The sort of look that, once finished, you want to dive back in and read again.</p> </blockquote> <p>Rosewater by Tana Thompson has wowed <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3446866\">bluefairy</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Wow, this was a stunning book and one I wholeheartedly enjoyed. Set in Nigeria in 2066 (with flashbacks over the main characters life) it shows a world which has had an alien life form crash to earth in London. This alien life form released fungal spores into the atmosphere which in turn has changed some humans to be \u2018sensitives\u2019 and can \u2018read\u2019 the resultant xenosphere. Rosewater is a town which has grown up around an alien dome. It\u2019s very well written, pacy and has engaging characters and concepts. Highly recommended and I can\u2019t wait for the next book to be released next month.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lionel Asbo by Martin Amis has delighted <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4515468\">vermontlogger</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve stayed away from most of Martin Amis, too much unrelieved intensity for my taste, but this was great - a raucous, hilarious novel set at the busy intersection of low-life criminality and tabloid voyeurism, the language buzzing throughout, and the last pages loaded with meaning. What a rip.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Redeeemed, the final instalment in Tim Pear\u2019s West Country trilogy has been a highlight for <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4813196\">safereturndoubtful</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The highlight of my reading in the last few days has been the final instalment in his West Country trilogy, Tim Pears\u2019s The Redeemed . In all three novels there are wonderful, memorable scenes; the images Pears creates of rural England in the early part of the century are powerfully evocative and a reminder that life could be tough and brutal, as well as the beauty in the nature that is described so well. <br>Having looked forward to this for a year now, and enjoyed it greatly, the only regret I have is that it may have been better to read them one after the other directly.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cA beautiful hardback edition\u201d of Madeline Miller\u2019s Circe has charmed <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2565880\">RickLondon</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Miller is a born storyteller and like Mary Renault before her, really transports you back to the ancient world. This is a fresh, feminist version of the story, from Circe\u2019s viewpoint, and even though I know the basic outline of the story and where it is going, I\u2019m gripped.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve started reading Murakami\u2019s Hear the Wind Sing,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13764657\">orie1227</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As its his first book (albeit only translated into English a couple of years ago), he\u2019s included a really interesting introduction giving a bit of a summary of how he got into writing, and what his writing process is (or at least what it was in the early stages of his career).</p> <p>What I found fascinating about this is he quickly found his writing style to be too expressive-almost as if he had too much to say-so he switched to writing in English due to his more limited vocabulary, before then translating it back into Japanese.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always really enjoyed his simple, clean, crisp writing style-opening a Murakami always feels a bit like a palate cleanser in my reading schedule-and it makes so much more sense now, knowing how he writes.</p> <p>I\u2019m not normally one for reading the intros in books, but thought that was worth sharing!</p> </blockquote> <p>Yes it was worth sharing.

In all three novels there are wonderful, memorable scenes; the images Pears creates of rural England in the early part of the century are powerfully evocative and a reminder that life could be tough and brutal, as well as the beauty in the nature that is described so well. Having looked forward to this for a year now, and enjoyed it greatly, the only regret I have is that it may have been better to read them one after the other directly. \u201cA beautiful hardback edition\u201d of Madeline Miller\u2019s Circe has charmed RickLondon: Miller is a born storyteller and like Mary Renault before her, really transports you back to the ancient world. This is a fresh, feminist version of the story, from Circe\u2019s viewpoint, and even though I know the basic outline of the story and where it is going, I\u2019m gripped. \u201cI\u2019ve started reading Murakami\u2019s Hear the Wind Sing,\u201d says orie1227: As its his first book (albeit only translated into English a couple of years ago), he\u2019s included a really interesting introduction giving a bit of a summary of how he got into writing, and what his writing process is (or at least what it was in the early stages of his career). What I found fascinating about this is he quickly found his writing style to be too expressive-almost as if he had too much to say-so he switched to writing in English due to his more limited vocabulary, before then translating it back into Japanese. I\u2019ve always really enjoyed his simple, clean, crisp writing style-opening a Murakami always feels a bit like a palate cleanser in my reading schedule-and it makes so much more sense now, knowing how he writes. I\u2019m not normally one for reading the intros in books, but thought that was worth sharing! Yes it was worth sharing. All such comments are. Interesting links about books and reading A lovely big article by Margaret Drabble on Anthony Burgess. \u201cIt is an excellent piece of writing.\u201d An 1845 review of Narrative Of The Life OF Frederick Douglass. Pat Barker on the art of fiction in the Paris Review. Michael Hofmann on UK politics. Depressing, but so eloquently depressing. The art of the twist ending.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May will not get her Brexit deal through the Commons, Donald Tusk has warned, leaving the UK with the option of \u201ca chaotic Brexit\u201d or an extension of its membership of the EU beyond 29 March. The European council president, to quell \u201cspeculation\u201d, disclosed that, during private talks with the prime minister at a summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, he had walked through the legal process that would need to be followed to delay Brexit. Tusk said it was not the EU\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d to extend the two-year negotiation but that it was now evident to him that it was the \u201crational solution\u201d in light of the prime minister\u2019s failure to corral a majority behind the deal. Shortly after Tusk spoke at a press conference together with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, at the end of the first EU-League of Arab states summit, May said they had had a good meeting but insisted that she remained opposed to any delay. \u201cAn extension to article 50, a delay in this process, doesn\u2019t deliver a decision in parliament, it doesn\u2019t deliver a deal,\u201d she said at a separate press conference. \u201cAll it does is precisely what the word \u2018delay\u2019 says. Any extension of article 50 isn\u2019t addressing the issues. \u201cWe have it within our grasp. I\u2019ve had a real sense from the meetings I\u2019ve had here and the conversations I\u2019ve had in recent days that we can achieve that deal. \u201cIt\u2019s within our grasp to leave with a deal on 29 March and that\u2019s where all of my energies are going to be focused.\u201d May refused to say she would sack ministers if they vote on Wednesday for an amendment tabled by former Labour and Conservative cabinet ministers Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin, which would instruct May to seek an extension of article 50 if she does not have a deal ratified by 13 March. \u201cNo one knows what [the motion] will say yet,\u201d she said when asked directly if ministers could lose their jobs. She signalled that it would be possible for MPs to vote on a withdrawal deal before it has been formally approved on 22 March by the EU. \u201cIt would be possible to do it either way and I would hope that we have that meaningful vote by the 12th,\u201d she said. Earlier, Juncker spoke of \u201cgood progress\u201d in drafting additional legal assurances about the temporary nature of the Irish backstop, following his meeting with May at the summit in Egypt. But Tusk offered a far more sombre analysis of the domestic political position facing May, given the EU\u2019s refusal to reopen the withdrawal agreement, or to set a time-limit or unilateral exit mechanism on the Irish backstop. \u201cI can say first of all that Prime Minster May and I discussed yesterday a lot of issues, including the legal and procedural context of a potential extension,\u201d Tusk told reporters. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s absolutely clear that there is no majority in the House of Commons to approve a deal. \u201cWe will face an alternative: a chaotic Brexit or extension.

And I can assure you, and I did it yesterday in my meeting with Prime Minister May, that no matter in which scenario we will be, all the 27 will show maximum understanding and goodwill.\u201d The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is due to re-engage with the British team, including Downing Street\u2019s senior Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins, and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, in Brussels on Tuesday. The two sides are drafting text that puts previous assurances of the temporary nature of the backstop, contained in letters from Tusk and Juncker late last year, into a legally-binding form. The political declaration is being upgraded potentially to include further UK commitments on workers\u2019 rights, and a document detailing the context in which a technological fix for the Irish border could supercede the all-UK customs union envisaged in the backstop is being worked upon. \u201cThe president and the prime minister agreed on the need to conclude this work in time before the European council on 21 March,\u201d an official said after Juncker\u2019s meeting with May. After delaying the meaningful vote on the deal, scheduled for this week, May has said she will return to the Commons on 12 March to put it to MPs. Tusk, however, expressed the doubts widely felt in EU capitals about the chances of the package winning over rebellious MPs in the Conservative party, and the Democratic Unionist party.

For the past six months, and in particular the past six weeks, the question was: would this year\u2019s Oscars be so butt-clenchingly, fist-gnawingly, eye-rollingly, hair-tearingly bad that the whole shebang would have to be burned in a garbage fire of shame?</p> \n<p>Unlike the Chinese, the Oscars has always foolishly resisted naming its individual years, leaving their distinguishing signifiers to be decided by the merciless press and public. Thus, the 2012 Oscars was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2012/feb/28/angelina-jolie-right-leg-oscar\" title=\"\">the Year of Angelina\u2019s Leg</a>.

The 2017 Oscars \u2013 well, let\u2019s just say \u201cenvelope\u201d and leave it there.</p> \n<p>Even before the year started, 2019 looked like it was the Year of Oscars\u2019 Nervous Breakdown. Let\u2019s have a quick recap of the Academy Awards\u2019 bewildering screw-ups over the past 12 months, shall we? First, in an attempt to stop the decline in TV ratings, the Academy announced it was introducing a new category, best popular film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/06/oscars-popular-film-category-suspended\" title=\"\">then it announced that it wasn\u2019t</a>. Then it announced Kevin Hart was hosting, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/10/kevin-hart-not-returning-to-host-oscars\" title=\"\">then it announced he wasn\u2019t</a>. Then it said the winners of some categories would not be announced on TV, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/16/oscars-drop-plan-for-ad-break-presentations-after-industry-outcry\" title=\"\">then it decided against that, too</a>. Those of us who were outraged that Bohemian Rhapsody and Green Book were nominated for best film instead of the indescribably superior Leave No Trace and You Were Never Really Here (both ignored by the Academy and both, coincidentally, or maybe not, directed by women), consoled ourselves with the thought that the Academy would probably reverse ferret on that, too, possibly mid-ceremony.</p> \n<p>It wasn\u2019t just the Oscars that were over, but everything around them, too. The Vanity Fair party, for so long the night\u2019s golden ticket, was deemed last week <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/style/vanity-fair-oscar-party.html\" title=\"\">to be \u201cpast its prime\u201d by the New York Times</a>. It had become, the article alleged, a bloated, overly corporate, anachronistic warhorse that allowed in \u2013 good God! \u2013 \u201ccivilians\u201d. Vanity Fair, it has to be said, did not help itself by giving the NYT such quotes as: \u201cWe\u2019re finding additional media opportunities we can monetise that come out of the party.\u201d (Woo hoo, party on!) Instead, the coolest Oscars\u2019 night\u2019s parties are now deemed to be the ones hosted by actual celebrities, such as Madonna\u2019s long-running one and Jay-Z\u2019s new upstart. Proving that it may be pass\u00e9, but can still muster up A-list-level huffiness, Vanity Fair reportedly disinvited the NYT\u2019s reporter.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b1f93de3-99af-41aa-b8a8-b3e3b1f4edb4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HhNcrIi0cs8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Salting the wound, US Vogue\u2019s March issue is, the cover declared, a celebration of how California became \u201cthe centre of everything\u201d, from art to fertility treatments. One industry that barely gets a mention, however, is movies, with a pop star (Justin Bieber) and model (Hailey Baldwin) given the cover. Inside, a fashion shoot celebrating \u201ca new generation of Hollywood talents\u201d stars Kendall Jenner, suggesting that the only screen stars that matter these days are the ones on Instagram. And given Jenner has a jaw-dropping 104 million followers on Instagram \u2013 four times the number of people who watched the Oscars last year \u2013 maybe that\u2019s true.</p> \n<p>Apologies for the obvious point, but Vanity Fair and the Oscars are facing the same problem, which is a changing media world. Of course Vanity Fair needs to monetise its party: as with nearly all magazines, its sales figures are dropping. Similarly, the Oscars viewing figures have been in a death spiral for years, which is why the Academy keeps trying to jazz it up and cut the running time. And sure, these quick-fix ideas of logos and populist categories are ham-fisted and desperate, but the media ARE desperate. Then people hate these changes and then the organisations panic. As a result, neither the Oscars nor the Vanity Fair party have managed to stop their own decline or maintain their credibility. I think this is called being stuck between a rock and a flatline.</p> \n<p>To get to the Dolby theatre, which is where the Oscars is held, you have to pass a gazillion souvenir stands, all selling fantasies of Hollywood\u2019s golden era: Marilyn Monroe masks, Alfred Hitchcock postcards. All big cities indulge in a certain amount of self-mythology, but Los Angeles\u2019s self-love is frankly masturbatory, and never more so than on Oscars night, when viewers are repeatedly told we are witnessing the biggest night in movies with the most elite of celebrities. And yet the first person I spot in the Dolby is Marie Kondo, a woman who has forged a remarkable career for herself by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/04/tidying-up-with-marie-kondo-review-tv-destined-for-the-bin-bag-of-shame\" title=\"\">simply telling people to throw out their crap</a>. Just to emphasise how much the world has changed from the days of Monroe and Hitchcock, Kondo turns out to be the most elite person I meet all night, because she is forbidden from talking to anyone. \u201cShe\u2019s here with Access Hollywood so she can\u2019t give quotes. But you can have a selfie,\u201d her translator explains.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5617b5a07cc40ee51e2e2f323447a5cb9c7b8678\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5617b5a07cc40ee51e2e2f323447a5cb9c7b8678/0_126_1536_1920/800.jpg\" alt=\"Hadley Freeman with Marie Kondo at the Oscars.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hadley Freeman with Marie Kondo at the Oscars.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hadley Freeman</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Helen Mirren, happily, can give quotes when I find her in the theatre atrium.

Oh no, I\u2019m going home to get in my jimjams,\u201d she hoots, trailing off into the auditorium.</p> \n<p>By this point, I\u2019ve been hanging out in the atrium for two hours and no one who has passed \u2013 Glenn Close, Regina King, Jordan Peele \u2013 has caused too much of a stir. But suddenly there is a palpable thrill in the air and I turn around to see why: it\u2019s Chadwick Boseman and Michael B Jordan, arriving simultaneously and high fiving one another, to the delight of a million camera phones. So excited is everyone by the Black Panther guys that they don\u2019t even notice the person skulking in behind them, who happens to be Daniel Craig. Sorry, James Bond, but there are new movie heroes in town.</p> \n<p>When the Academy mooted the idea of a best popular film category, it was widely (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/18/oscar-popular-film-shape-water-hadley-freeman\" title=\"\">but not entirely</a>) derided as a way to give Black Panther a big award without having to give it the biggest award. Given what did actually get the biggest award on Sunday night (we\u2019ll get to that in a tick), I wonder if people still feel quite so down on the popular film idea, especially given Black Panther\u2019s obvious popularity. No other film was applauded quite so enthusiastically as Black Panther in the auditorium, with people leaping to their feet every time it got a trophy. Which brings me to the biggest change of the night.</p> \n<p>Before the Oscars, I had thought that, if it felt different from usual, it would be because (for the first time in decades) it didn\u2019t have a host. And yes, that did give the ceremony a disjointed feel, while also helping it to clip along at a nice speed. But, in fact, the biggest change was how how un-white and un-male it was. Women swept the documentary categories (\u201cI can\u2019t believe a film about menstruation just won an Oscar!\u201d shouted Raykha Zehtabchi, director of Period. End of Sentence) as well as best animated short (\u201cTo all the nerdy girls out there who hide behind your sketchbooks, don\u2019t be afraid to tell your story,\u201d Bao\u2019s director, Domee Shi, said in her speech). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2019/feb/25/olivia-colmans-oscars-speech-this-is-genuinely-quite-stressful-video\" title=\"\">Olivia Colman gave, unquestionably, the speech of the night</a>, while Lady Gaga definitively disproved A Star Is Born\u2019s weird implication to the contrary and showed she truly is the talented one of her and Bradley Cooper when they performed Shallow together.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"09d6475f-9a67-454b-af61-a4a853cc71ce\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GMd1RIvQuNw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Both supporting Oscars went to black actors (Regina King and Mahershala Ali), making Ali the first black man to get two supporting Oscars. Spike Lee finally got his dues, if not enough of them. And while Rami Malek\u2019s best actor Oscar was clearly ludicrous, there was compensation to be found in the thought that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/25/oscar-winner-rami-malek-bohemian-rhapsody-freddie-mercury-the-first-best-actor-of-arab-heritage\" title=\"\">he\u2019s the first Arab-American to win that award</a>, even if he made as much of an acknowledgement of this as he did of the Aids crisis that killed Freddie Mercury, which is to say barely any at all. A Mexican director got best director for the fifth time in six years. The 2019 Oscars looked something close to modern and I briefly wondered whether the event might modernise itself naturally and thereby broaden its appeal without clumsy interventions from the Academy. But then Green Book \u2013 a movie that thinks it\u2019s easier to cure racism than snobbery \u2013 won best picture, reminding us all that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/25/spike-lee-on-green-book-oscar-win-ref-made-bad-call\" title=\"\">Oscars won\u2019t evolve without a fight</a>.</p> \n<p>Over at the Vanity Fair party, which used to be styled to look like a cosy private club, but is now so big it feels like being in an impossibly crowded airport hangar, the first person I see is Instagram star and \u201cjoke curator\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/07/josh-ostrovsky-fat-jew-jon-ronson-instagram\" title=\"\">Josh Ostrovsky, AKA the Fat Jew</a>.

      "bodyText": "The question was not: would the Oscars be bad this year? For the past six months, and in particular the past six weeks, the question was: would this year\u2019s Oscars be so butt-clenchingly, fist-gnawingly, eye-rollingly, hair-tearingly bad that the whole shebang would have to be burned in a garbage fire of shame? Unlike the Chinese, the Oscars has always foolishly resisted naming its individual years, leaving their distinguishing signifiers to be decided by the merciless press and public. Thus, the 2012 Oscars was the Year of Angelina\u2019s Leg. The 2006 Oscars was the Year Crash Beat Brokeback (which was widely deemed to be the worst-ever best film decision \u2013 until this Sunday night). The 2017 Oscars \u2013 well, let\u2019s just say \u201cenvelope\u201d and leave it there. Even before the year started, 2019 looked like it was the Year of Oscars\u2019 Nervous Breakdown. Let\u2019s have a quick recap of the Academy Awards\u2019 bewildering screw-ups over the past 12 months, shall we? First, in an attempt to stop the decline in TV ratings, the Academy announced it was introducing a new category, best popular film, then it announced that it wasn\u2019t. Then it announced Kevin Hart was hosting, then it announced he wasn\u2019t. Then it said the winners of some categories would not be announced on TV, then it decided against that, too. Those of us who were outraged that Bohemian Rhapsody and Green Book were nominated for best film instead of the indescribably superior Leave No Trace and You Were Never Really Here (both ignored by the Academy and both, coincidentally, or maybe not, directed by women), consoled ourselves with the thought that the Academy would probably reverse ferret on that, too, possibly mid-ceremony. It wasn\u2019t just the Oscars that were over, but everything around them, too. The Vanity Fair party, for so long the night\u2019s golden ticket, was deemed last week to be \u201cpast its prime\u201d by the New York Times. It had become, the article alleged, a bloated, overly corporate, anachronistic warhorse that allowed in \u2013 good God! \u2013 \u201ccivilians\u201d. Vanity Fair, it has to be said, did not help itself by giving the NYT such quotes as: \u201cWe\u2019re finding additional media opportunities we can monetise that come out of the party.\u201d (Woo hoo, party on!) Instead, the coolest Oscars\u2019 night\u2019s parties are now deemed to be the ones hosted by actual celebrities, such as Madonna\u2019s long-running one and Jay-Z\u2019s new upstart. Proving that it may be pass\u00e9, but can still muster up A-list-level huffiness, Vanity Fair reportedly disinvited the NYT\u2019s reporter. Salting the wound, US Vogue\u2019s March issue is, the cover declared, a celebration of how California became \u201cthe centre of everything\u201d, from art to fertility treatments. One industry that barely gets a mention, however, is movies, with a pop star (Justin Bieber) and model (Hailey Baldwin) given the cover. Inside, a fashion shoot celebrating \u201ca new generation of Hollywood talents\u201d stars Kendall Jenner, suggesting that the only screen stars that matter these days are the ones on Instagram. And given Jenner has a jaw-dropping 104 million followers on Instagram \u2013 four times the number of people who watched the Oscars last year \u2013 maybe that\u2019s true. Apologies for the obvious point, but Vanity Fair and the Oscars are facing the same problem, which is a changing media world.

      "bodyText": "Andy Robertson believes Liverpool should start \u201crespecting ourselves\u201d by using how Manchester United and Bayern Munich set up against them as a mark of how highly they are rated. Liverpool\u2019s 0-0 draw at Old Trafford on Sunday meant they missed a chance to pull three points ahead of Manchester City with 11 matches remaining. Robertson pointed to how United and Bayern attempted to stymie them and wants this to be an inspiration the next time it occurs. The Champions League last-16 opening leg against the German club at Anfield last Tuesday was also a goalless draw. \u201cBig teams like Bayern and Manchester United are full of world-class stars and they changed their way of playing to try to stop us,\u201d the left-back told Liverpool\u2019s website. \u201cWe need to take that as a mark of respect and not shy away from it, stand up to that and show them why there is respect. These big teams are showing us respect but maybe we need to start respecting ourselves.\u201d The draw on Sunday was disrupted by an injury-strewn first half during which United\u2019s manager, Ole Gunner Solskj\u00e6r, had to make all three of his allowed substitutions, as Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata and Ander Herrera sustained hamstring problems. Klopp had to take Roberto Firmino off because of a sore ankle. Robertson said: \u201cFour substitutions in the first half is unheard of in a game like that. We need to deal with that better because the game still was on and when the game stopped it kind of killed our momentum. \u201cA point at Old Trafford is never a bad result.

In the strongest warning on Brexit yet from the Association of British Insurers (ABI), the industry body\u2019s director general, Huw Evans, will say in a speech on Monday evening that \u201cleaving the world\u2019s single biggest trading block overnight with nothing but WTO [World Trade Organization] rules to replace it \u2026 would be wholly inadequate and unprecedented\u201d. Speaking at the ABI\u2019s annual dinner at Drapers\u2019 Hall in the City of London, attended by the bosses of major insurers, senior politicians and regulators, Evans will add: \u201cNone of the EU\u2019s 20 largest trading partners trade with the EU on solely WTO terms; they all have deeper agreements in place.\u201d The EU is by far the largest export market for the UK insurance and long-term savings industry, Evans will say. The ABI has previously warned that millions of car and travel policies could be in limbo if there is no transition deal. Leaving the EU without a deal would mean that from April Britons driving in mainland Europe and Ireland will have to carry a motor insurance green card. His remarks will come as latest figures reveal the UK insurance industry has a \u00a316.7bn export surplus, with more than a third of this consisting of trade with the EU.

Derivatives are financial contracts widely used by companies to manage risks, ranging from hedging against changes in central bank interest rates to fluctuations in commodity prices. Brexit threatens to unpick trading in the UK, even with the US, as City banks currently operate under EU rules while Britain is a member of the bloc. Under the steps announced by the Bank of England, the Financial Conduct Authority and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, firms working in the US and the UK will continue to meet the requirements required to operate in both countries, even if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.

      "body": "<p>One week ago, when we launched our campaign for president, I asked people from across the country to sign up to be part of an unprecedented grassroots campaign. The response from the American people has been historic.</p> <p>In six days, more than one million people have answered the call. Americans from every single congressional district in the country have signed up to help lead a movement that is not only about defeating Donald Trump, the most dangerous president in modern American history, but about creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice.</p> <p>This task will not be easy. Today, we have more income and wealth inequality than at any time since the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/02/08/wealth-concentration-returning-levels-last-seen-during-roaring-twenties-according-new-research/?utm_term=.8ec2359febab\">1920s</a>, and the three wealthiest Americans <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2017/11/09/the-3-richest-americans-hold-more-wealth-than-bottom-50-of-country-study-finds/\">own more wealth</a> than the bottom half of our country.</p> <p>Despite relatively low unemployment, millions of people work <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t16.htm\">multiple jobs</a> because they earn <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/data/#/?subject=wage-percentiles&amp;r=*\">starvation wages</a>, <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/246134/uninsured-rate-rises-four-year-high.aspx\">34 million</a> Americans have no health insurance, and we pay the <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/sites/default/files/documents/___media_files_publications_issue_brief_2017_oct_sarnak_paying_for_rx_ib_v2.pdf\">highest prices</a> in the world for prescription drugs.</p> <p>Shamefully, we treat our most vulnerable people with disdain. We have the highest rate of <a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/inequality/poverty-rate.htm\">childhood poverty</a> of almost any major nation and a dysfunctional and unaffordable childcare system. While many Republicans want to cut Social Security, about half of older Americans have <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-15-419\">no retirement savings</a>.</p> <p>And, in the midst of all of that, we have a president who is a pathological liar, a fraud, racist, sexist, xenophobe, religious bigot and someone who is moving this country in an authoritarian direction.</p> <p>To be successful in creating a government and economy that works for the many, we will have to take on powerful special interests that dominate our economic and political life \u2013 Wall Street, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the military-industrial-complex, the private-prison industry and multinational corporations. These special interests have extraordinary power, and they will spend enormous sums of money to maintain the status quo and their wealth.</p> <p>The only way we will defeat Donald Trump and the special interests that support him is with a grassroots movement \u2013 the likes of which has never been seen in American history. We must stand together \u2013 women and men, black, white, Latino, Native American, Asian American, gay and straight, young and old, native born and immigrant \u2013 to address the challenges we face as a nation.</p> <p>At a time when our infrastructure is crumbling and we have an affordable housing crisis, we can create millions of good paying jobs rebuilding our country. Together, we can raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour, provide pay equity for women and guarantee all workers paid family and medical leave.</p> <p>We cannot afford to wait any longer to address the existential threat of climate change. We must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels toward energy efficiency and sustainable energy, creating millions of jobs in the process.</p> <p>While we spend almost <a href=\"https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/health-spending-u-s-compare-countries/#item-average-wealthy-countries-spend-half-much-per-person-health-u-s-spends\">twice as much</a> per capita on health care as any nation, our health outcomes are <a href=\"https://interactives.commonwealthfund.org/2017/july/mirror-mirror/\">worse</a> and life expectancy is in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/us-life-expectancy-declines-again-a-dismal-trend-not-seen-since-world-war-i/2018/11/28/ae58bc8c-f28c-11e8-bc79-68604ed88993_story.html?utm_term=.7f2261265553\">decline</a>. It is time for us to join every other major country and guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege, through a Medicare-for-all program.</p> <p>Unbelievably, Americans are saddled with <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/05/pf/college/student-loan-stats/index.html\">$1.5tn</a> in student loan debt and many young people can\u2019t afford the cost of college. We must lower the egregious level of student debt and make public colleges and universities tuition-free.</p> <p>The United States has the <a href=\"http://www.prisonstudies.org/highest-to-lowest/prison-population-total?field_region_taxonomy_tid=All\">highest incarceration rate</a> in the world and African Americans are incarcerated at more than <a href=\"https://www.naacp.org/criminal-justice-fact-sheet/\">five times</a> the rate of white people. Our job is to end the destructive \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d eliminate private prisons and cash bail and bring about major police department reform.</p> <p>Instead of demonizing undocumented immigrants as our current president has done, we should fight for comprehensive immigration reform, a path toward citizenship, immediate legal status for the young people eligible for the Daca program and a humane policy for those at the border who seek asylum.</p> <p>At a time when women\u2019s rights are under attack at the local, state and federal level, we must defend a woman\u2019s right to control her own body.</p> <p>To confront the epidemic of gun violence, we need to take on the NRA, expand background checks, end the gun show loophole and ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons.</p> <p>And finally, we must end Trump\u2019s support for authoritarian leaders. We need a foreign policy which focuses on democracy, human rights, world peace, global wealth inequality, climate change and massive corporate tax evasion.</p> <p>In 2016, our campaign began the political revolution. The ideas we fought for, which then were considered \u201cradical\u201d or \u201cextreme,\u201d are now supported by a majority of Americans. Now, it is time to defeat Donald Trump, complete that revolution and implement the vision we fought for.</p> <ul> <li><p>Bernie Sanders is a US Senator from Vermont</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "One week ago, when we launched our campaign for president, I asked people from across the country to sign up to be part of an unprecedented grassroots campaign. The response from the American people has been historic. In six days, more than one million people have answered the call. Americans from every single congressional district in the country have signed up to help lead a movement that is not only about defeating Donald Trump, the most dangerous president in modern American history, but about creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice. This task will not be easy. Today, we have more income and wealth inequality than at any time since the 1920s, and the three wealthiest Americans own more wealth than the bottom half of our country. Despite relatively low unemployment, millions of people work multiple jobs because they earn starvation wages, 34 million Americans have no health insurance, and we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Shamefully, we treat our most vulnerable people with disdain. We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major nation and a dysfunctional and unaffordable childcare system. While many Republicans want to cut Social Security, about half of older Americans have no retirement savings. And, in the midst of all of that, we have a president who is a pathological liar, a fraud, racist, sexist, xenophobe, religious bigot and someone who is moving this country in an authoritarian direction. To be successful in creating a government and economy that works for the many, we will have to take on powerful special interests that dominate our economic and political life \u2013 Wall Street, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the military-industrial-complex, the private-prison industry and multinational corporations. These special interests have extraordinary power, and they will spend enormous sums of money to maintain the status quo and their wealth. The only way we will defeat Donald Trump and the special interests that support him is with a grassroots movement \u2013 the likes of which has never been seen in American history. We must stand together \u2013 women and men, black, white, Latino, Native American, Asian American, gay and straight, young and old, native born and immigrant \u2013 to address the challenges we face as a nation. At a time when our infrastructure is crumbling and we have an affordable housing crisis, we can create millions of good paying jobs rebuilding our country. Together, we can raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour, provide pay equity for women and guarantee all workers paid family and medical leave. We cannot afford to wait any longer to address the existential threat of climate change. We must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels toward energy efficiency and sustainable energy, creating millions of jobs in the process. While we spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as any nation, our health outcomes are worse and life expectancy is in decline. It is time for us to join every other major country and guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege, through a Medicare-for-all program. Unbelievably, Americans are saddled with $1.5tn in student loan debt and many young people can\u2019t afford the cost of college. We must lower the egregious level of student debt and make public colleges and universities tuition-free. The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world and African Americans are incarcerated at more than five times the rate of white people. Our job is to end the destructive \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d eliminate private prisons and cash bail and bring about major police department reform. Instead of demonizing undocumented immigrants as our current president has done, we should fight for comprehensive immigration reform, a path toward citizenship, immediate legal status for the young people eligible for the Daca program and a humane policy for those at the border who seek asylum. At a time when women\u2019s rights are under attack at the local, state and federal level, we must defend a woman\u2019s right to control her own body. To confront the epidemic of gun violence, we need to take on the NRA, expand background checks, end the gun show loophole and ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons. And finally, we must end Trump\u2019s support for authoritarian leaders. We need a foreign policy which focuses on democracy, human rights, world peace, global wealth inequality, climate change and massive corporate tax evasion. In 2016, our campaign began the political revolution. The ideas we fought for, which then were considered \u201cradical\u201d or \u201cextreme,\u201d are now supported by a majority of Americans. Now, it is time to defeat Donald Trump, complete that revolution and implement the vision we fought for. Bernie Sanders is a US Senator from Vermont",

In 2017, 21 homeless people died in the city, three more than in Birmingham and four more than in Liverpool. Overall, 136 people died in London \u2013 which is made up of 33 local authorities \u2013 including 17 deaths in Lambeth and 15 in Camden, according to the estimates. The figures show that the relative poverty of an area is closely linked to the number of rough sleeper deaths. The most deprived areas had about nine times more deaths of homeless people relative to their population than the least disadvantaged areas, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) found. The figures follow last December\u2019s estimate that 597 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2017 and a total of 2,627 had died in the five years from 2014. Official rough sleeping counts in Manchester have soared from seven people in 2010 to 123 in 2018 and, in common with many other cities, it has become highly visible, with numerous people bedding down in city centre doorways and underpasses. Manchester has one of the highest rough sleeping rates in the country, and one homeless man who has lost two friends has even been running homelessness tours to increase awareness. But smaller towns recorded the highest numbers of homeless deaths per head of population. Blackburn with Darwen, in Lancashire, appeared in the five highest rates in four of the five years from 2014, and in 2017 it had the highest rate in England and Wales, with nine deaths on record. The next highest rate was in Oxford, followed by Camden, Barrow-in-Furness and Canterbury. The Guardian revealed last month that at least four homeless people had died in Oxford since November, and this month the body of another suspected rough sleeper was found in a churchyard. An estimated 10 homeless people died in Oxford in 2017, according to the ONS, and 33 in the five years from 2014. The situation in Oxford has sparked widespread public anger and last week the city council asked the Oxfordshire Safeguarding Adults Board to review whether serious harm experienced by people with care and support needs was down to neglect or abuse and whether this could have been predicted or stopped. In December Aron Gibson, 37, died in a McDonald\u2019s in Cornmarket, in Oxford city centre. Four days later Czeslaw Mazak, 36, who slept rough and often without a tent, was found dead near a city centre nightclub, and there were two deaths in housing projects funded by the government\u2019s rough sleeper initiative: Sharron Maasz, 44, who died on 21 January and a 50-year-old man who died on 29 January. A man in his 60s was also found in St Frideswide churchyard and died on 5 February. Responding to the new figures, Jon Sparkes, chief executive of the homeless charity Crisis, said it was \u201cshameful that hundreds of people across England and Wales with nowhere to turn have died while homeless\u201d. \u201cGovernments must ensure local authorities, particularly in the most deprived areas, have the appropriate funding to conduct reviews into the death of every person who has died while homeless, to prevent more people from dying needlessly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must also make sure that when people do become homeless, they are rehoused quickly, and with the support they need to keep their homes, whether it\u2019s help to find employment, mental health support or drug and alcohol services.\u201d The ONS said: \u201cThese new estimates are important because of the need for high-quality health intelligence to inform local homelessness strategies and the most appropriate provision of services.\u201d The housing secretary, James Brokenshire, said the data \u201cwill support us in our mission to end rough sleeping for good\u201d. \u201cEvery death on our streets is one too many and it is simply unacceptable to see lives cut short this way,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are investing \u00a31.2bn to tackle homelessness and have bold plans backed by \u00a3100m to end rough sleeping for good. Councils have used this funding to create an additional 1,750 beds and 500 rough sleeping support staff.\u201d He highlighted figures published last month that showed a small fall in rough sleeping across England and Wales for the first time in eight years, albeit with increases in major cities. Some councils have said that they were encouraged by the ministry of housing to use a snapshot street count rather than estimates that are also based on other information, leading to concerns of undercounting. \u201cI am also committed to ensuring independent reviews into the deaths of rough sleepers are conducted, where appropriate, so that important lessons are learned \u2013 and I will be holding local authorities to account in doing just that,\u201d said Brokenshire.",

      "bodyText": "Liam Adams, the brother of the former Sinn F\u00e9in president Gerry Adams, has died in custody while serving a 16-year sentence for raping his own daughter. The 63-year-old had cancer and was moved from Maghaberry prison to a hospice in Belfast this month. The Northern Ireland Prison Service said he died on Monday morning and his next of kin had been informed. The former IRA member was convicted in 2013 for raping and sexually assaulting his daughter \u00c1ine between 1977 and 1983 when she was aged between four and nine. The case piled pressure on Gerry Adams to explain why he did not alert authorities when he learned of the abuse in 1987. Liam Adams admitted the abuse to his brother in 2000 and went on to work in youth clubs, including one in west Belfast, the constituency of Gerry Adams, who was then an MP. \u00c1ine said the politician brushed off her request to keep her father away from children. \u201cGerry told me that was Liam\u2019s way of trying to make up to the community for what he done to me.\u201d The Sinn F\u00e9in leader gave his first statement to the Police Service of Northern Ireland about the abuse in 2007. When the case led to a subsequent prosecution and public outcry, the Sinn F\u00e9in leader accused political opponents of exploiting a family tragedy and said child abuse was \u201cabove politics\u201d. Sinn F\u00e9in and the IRA have faced additional criticism in a separate case involving Maria Cahill, who said she was repeatedly raped by a senior IRA member and that the republican movement covered it up. Adams, who stepped down as Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s leader last year, made no immediate comment on Monday. He reportedly visited his brother at the hospice this month. After a lengthy attempt to avoid extradition from the Republic of Ireland, Liam Adams, a former Sinn F\u00e9in activist from west Belfast, was found guilty in Belfast crown court of 10 offences against his daughter. Now called Aine Dahlstrom and aged 45, she waived her anonymity to highlight the case. Gerry Adams disclosed in 2009 that his father, Gerry Adams Sr, had \u201cemotionally, physically and sexually\u201d abused members of their family.",

      "body": "<p>The mysterious offshore purchaser of a stake in the Evening Standard has been unveiled as a Saudi businessman with ties to the country\u2019s state-owned bank.</p> <p>Sultan Mohamed Abuljadayel bought a third of the news outlet\u2019s parent company from Evgeny Lebedev, the son of a Russian oligarch, for \u00a325m at the end of last year, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc322db6-385e-11e9-b72b-2c7f526ca5d0\">according to the FT</a>. A spokesperson for the Evening Standard did not dispute that Abuljadayel was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/30/mystery-offshore-investor-takes-20-share-in-evening-standard-evgeny-lebedev\">behind the purchase</a>, which was made through a company registered in the Cayman Islands.</p> <p>The confirmation of Saudi investment in London\u2019s main newspaper, which is edited by the former Conservative chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/20/george-osborne-defends-new-job-as-evening-standard-editor\">George Osborne</a> and distributes 860,000 copies a day for free across the capital, comes as scrutiny is growing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/oct/19/independent-deal-with-saudi-publisher-back-under-spotlight\">Middle Eastern investments in British media outlets</a>.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia and its regional allies in the United Arab Emirates are locked in a regional battle with their fellow Gulf state Qatar, with all sides spending substantial sums of money on lobbying and media influence campaigns in London and Washington DC. Concerns have been raised about Saudi investment in media outlets given the country\u2019s weak record on human rights and press freedoms.</p> <p>Abuljadayel previously bought around a third of the Independent, which is also controlled by Lebedev, two years ago. Since then the Independent has launched an <a href=\"https://www.independentarabia.com/\">Arabic-language spin-off edition</a>, which operates under the British news outlet\u2019s brand but is edited and run by a Saudi media company with close links to the royal family.</p> <p>Lebedev has taken an interest in the war in Yemen, posing on Instagram with Saudi-backed militias while accompanying Evening Standard journalists on a visit to the country, which resulted in a lengthy piece on the Middle East conflict in the newspaper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BihQpLoA-95/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "The mysterious offshore purchaser of a stake in the Evening Standard has been unveiled as a Saudi businessman with ties to the country\u2019s state-owned bank. Sultan Mohamed Abuljadayel bought a third of the news outlet\u2019s parent company from Evgeny Lebedev, the son of a Russian oligarch, for \u00a325m at the end of last year, according to the FT. A spokesperson for the Evening Standard did not dispute that Abuljadayel was behind the purchase, which was made through a company registered in the Cayman Islands. The confirmation of Saudi investment in London\u2019s main newspaper, which is edited by the former Conservative chancellor George Osborne and distributes 860,000 copies a day for free across the capital, comes as scrutiny is growing of Middle Eastern investments in British media outlets. Saudi Arabia and its regional allies in the United Arab Emirates are locked in a regional battle with their fellow Gulf state Qatar, with all sides spending substantial sums of money on lobbying and media influence campaigns in London and Washington DC. Concerns have been raised about Saudi investment in media outlets given the country\u2019s weak record on human rights and press freedoms. Abuljadayel previously bought around a third of the Independent, which is also controlled by Lebedev, two years ago. Since then the Independent has launched an Arabic-language spin-off edition, which operates under the British news outlet\u2019s brand but is edited and run by a Saudi media company with close links to the royal family. Lebedev has taken an interest in the war in Yemen, posing on Instagram with Saudi-backed militias while accompanying Evening Standard journalists on a visit to the country, which resulted in a lengthy piece on the Middle East conflict in the newspaper. Very little is known about Abuljadayel, a Saudi banker with connections to NCB Capital, a division of a bank ultimately controlled by the Saudi government. He had no track record in the UK media industry before his 2017 investment in the Independent. On official paperwork, Abuljadayel said he made the first investment in a personal capacity, although at the time it was made clear that his backing was connected to a plan to open Arabic and Urdu-language editions of the Independent. Abuljadayel\u2019s latest investment in Lebedev Holdings, the Evening Standard\u2019s parent company, was made through a Cayman Islands company, which obscured the Saudi\u2019s role and instead led to feverish speculation about the identity of the investor. A spokesperson for the Evening Standard said: \u201cLebedev Holdings Ltd is a private holding company and as such we never comment publicly on our individual shareholders.\u201d The latest investment brings the Saudi\u2019s total expenditure on stakes in Lebedev-controlled media businesses to about \u00a350m, a substantial investment in the struggling British media industry. Both the Evening Standard and the Independent were separately sold for \u00a31 each in 2009 and 2010 to the Lebedev family, which is headed by Alexander Lebedev, a KGB agent turned businessman, and his 38-year-old son Evgeny. Although the Evening Standard remains influential and retains a substantial audience across the capital, its business model is struggling owing to the long-term decline in print advertising. Last year it recorded a loss of \u00a310m.",

      "body": "<p>Scepticism about the use of vaccines for children has risen across Europe in line with votes for populists, according to a study, which proposes that public health officials should track populist parties in opinion polls as a proxy signal for vaccine hesitancy.</p> <p>Big surges in the number of measles cases and deaths map to countries where populist parties have become prominent \u2013 in particular, Greece, Italy and France.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/21/measles-cases-at-highest-for-20-years-in-europe-as-anti-vaccine-movement-grows\">Measles cases at highest for 20 years in Europe, as anti-vaccine movement grows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckz004\">paper, in the European Journal of Public Health</a>, says there is an underlying link between anti-establishment politics and vaccine hesitancy. </p> <p>\u201cIt seems likely that scientific populism is driven by similar feelings to political populism \u2013 ie profound distrust of elites and experts by disenfranchised and marginalised parts of the population,\u201d writes the author, Jonathan Kennedy from Queen Mary University of London.</p> <p>As there is a lack of monitoring surveys of attitudes toward vaccines, the researchers argue the performance of populist parties could instead be used to alert public health bodies to rising levels of scepticism.</p> <p>\u201cSupport for populist parties could be used as a proxy for vaccine hesitancy, at least in the western European context, with an increase in support being a signal for public health actors to be vigilant,\u201d the paper says.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/21/rightwing-populists-ride-wave-of-mistrust-of-vaccine-science\">A Guardian investigation in December</a> showed growing concern about the impact of populism on public confidence in vaccines, revealing that measles cases in Europe were at a 20-year high, with 60,000 cases and 72 deaths. The suspicions and rhetoric of anti-vaccination groups have been adopted by some populist politicians, for instance in Italy where the parliament last year passed a law to end compulsory vaccines for children in state schools. Shortly afterwards, the law was repealed because of the \u201cemergency\u201d caused by soaring measles cases.</p> <p>The study mapped findings from the Vaccine Confidence Project, carried out for the European commission, with votes for populist parties in 14 western European countries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/scatterplot-zip/giv-39022lWDVIFrmAOK/\" data-alt=\"Vaccines study\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/scatterplot-zip/giv-39022lWDVIFrmAOK/\">Vaccines study</a> </figure>  <p>It found a strong correlation between votes for populist parties and doubts that vaccines work.</p> <p>\u201cThe higher the level of populist votes in a country, the greater the proportion of the population that believe vaccines are not effective,\u201d says the paper. A correlation was also found between voting for populists and believing that vaccination was not important. The UK and Denmark had a higher proportion of people voting for populist parties (Ukip, the BNP and the Danish People\u2019s party) compared with those who had doubts about vaccines than other countries.</p> <p>The study focused on the 2014 European parliament election results, but looked also at the results of the previous national parliamentary election in each country and found the link between voting for populist parties and vaccine hesitancy was even more clear.</p> <p>\u201cWe talk about populism and what happens in politics,\u201d said Kennedy, citing Brexit and the difficulties in Greece, \u201cbut when you look at what is behind the rise of populism, it is the broad trend of lack of trust in elites and experts. That impacts on academia and public health and issues like climate change and vaccine scepticism.\u201d</p> <p>The study groups together populist parties on the right and the left of politics for their anti-establishment message, which, when it comes to vaccines, appears to translate into an anti-science, anti-public health institutions and anti-pharma message.</p> <p>In the US, President Donald Trump has backed the anti-vaxxers, supporting the discredited theory that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine can cause autism, and inviting the author of the hypothesis, Andrew Wakefield, to his inaugural ball. But not all the distrust of the establishment is from the right, says Kennedy.</p> <p>\u201cGreece has the highest per capita level of measles in western Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a long history of why Greeks don\u2019t trust the state. It goes back to the Ottoman occupation.</p> <p>\u201cThe trouble is we do need to have some basic trust in experts to survive as a human society,\u201d he said. To prevent measles outbreaks, it is necessary to have 95% of children vaccinated. \u201cWe need the state to protect those who cannot be vaccinated because of compromised immune systems.</p> <p>\u201cThe WHO talks about vaccines preventing 2 to 3 million deaths every year. It is very clear that they have a benefit to human society.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Scepticism about the use of vaccines for children has risen across Europe in line with votes for populists, according to a study, which proposes that public health officials should track populist parties in opinion polls as a proxy signal for vaccine hesitancy. Big surges in the number of measles cases and deaths map to countries where populist parties have become prominent \u2013 in particular, Greece, Italy and France. The paper, in the European Journal of Public Health, says there is an underlying link between anti-establishment politics and vaccine hesitancy. \u201cIt seems likely that scientific populism is driven by similar feelings to political populism \u2013 ie profound distrust of elites and experts by disenfranchised and marginalised parts of the population,\u201d writes the author, Jonathan Kennedy from Queen Mary University of London. As there is a lack of monitoring surveys of attitudes toward vaccines, the researchers argue the performance of populist parties could instead be used to alert public health bodies to rising levels of scepticism. \u201cSupport for populist parties could be used as a proxy for vaccine hesitancy, at least in the western European context, with an increase in support being a signal for public health actors to be vigilant,\u201d the paper says. A Guardian investigation in December showed growing concern about the impact of populism on public confidence in vaccines, revealing that measles cases in Europe were at a 20-year high, with 60,000 cases and 72 deaths. The suspicions and rhetoric of anti-vaccination groups have been adopted by some populist politicians, for instance in Italy where the parliament last year passed a law to end compulsory vaccines for children in state schools. Shortly afterwards, the law was repealed because of the \u201cemergency\u201d caused by soaring measles cases. The study mapped findings from the Vaccine Confidence Project, carried out for the European commission, with votes for populist parties in 14 western European countries. It found a strong correlation between votes for populist parties and doubts that vaccines work. \u201cThe higher the level of populist votes in a country, the greater the proportion of the population that believe vaccines are not effective,\u201d says the paper. A correlation was also found between voting for populists and believing that vaccination was not important. The UK and Denmark had a higher proportion of people voting for populist parties (Ukip, the BNP and the Danish People\u2019s party) compared with those who had doubts about vaccines than other countries. The study focused on the 2014 European parliament election results, but looked also at the results of the previous national parliamentary election in each country and found the link between voting for populist parties and vaccine hesitancy was even more clear. \u201cWe talk about populism and what happens in politics,\u201d said Kennedy, citing Brexit and the difficulties in Greece, \u201cbut when you look at what is behind the rise of populism, it is the broad trend of lack of trust in elites and experts. That impacts on academia and public health and issues like climate change and vaccine scepticism.\u201d The study groups together populist parties on the right and the left of politics for their anti-establishment message, which, when it comes to vaccines, appears to translate into an anti-science, anti-public health institutions and anti-pharma message. In the US, President Donald Trump has backed the anti-vaxxers, supporting the discredited theory that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine can cause autism, and inviting the author of the hypothesis, Andrew Wakefield, to his inaugural ball. But not all the distrust of the establishment is from the right, says Kennedy. \u201cGreece has the highest per capita level of measles in western Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a long history of why Greeks don\u2019t trust the state. It goes back to the Ottoman occupation. \u201cThe trouble is we do need to have some basic trust in experts to survive as a human society,\u201d he said. To prevent measles outbreaks, it is necessary to have 95% of children vaccinated. \u201cWe need the state to protect those who cannot be vaccinated because of compromised immune systems. \u201cThe WHO talks about vaccines preventing 2 to 3 million deaths every year. It is very clear that they have a benefit to human society.\u201d",

But later that day Burnley put out a statement <a href=\"https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/2019/january/two-games-moved-for-tv/\" title=\"\">confirming that was indeed the case</a>: we were playing Newcastle on the Tuesday instead.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/25/pick-team-least-annoying-tophy-season\">Time to pick the least annoying team to support as trophy season begins | Scott Murray</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The reason for the change will come as little surprise to supporters who travel up and down the country to watch their team play \u2013 a broadcaster got involved. In this case it was BT Sport, which had a slot to fill after Manchester City v West Ham, which it had scheduled to show on Tuesday, had to be pushed back by 24 hours as a consequence of City\u2019s involvement in the Carabao Cup final. BT Sport could have chosen to show live coverage of another of the games taking place that evening \u2013 Cardiff v Everton, Huddersfield v Wolves, Leicester v Brighton \u2013 but instead shifted Newcastle v Burnley from its Wednesday slot.</p> <p>Asked to explain the decision, a spokesman for BT Sport said it could not show Leicester v Brighton as it had \u201calready maxed out our Leicester picks\u201d, but there were no reasons for not showing either of the other games, with the spokesman adding: \u201cWhen making game selections we will always aim to choose the strongest game available for us.\u201d In other words, Newcastle v Burnley was moved because, as a game which at the time was a genuine \u2018relegation six-pointer\u2019, it made commercial sense to do so.</p> <p>It is often the way and unlikely to change given the influence broadcasters who pay to show live football in this country \u2013 BT Sport, Sky Sports and BBC \u2013 have on scheduling. But something can be done to help affected supporters, and that is what finally appears to be happening.</p> <p>Following two years of campaigning by the shadow sports minister, Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, the government announced this month that it had agreed to work with the Premier League, British Transport Police and the rail companies to create a policy that would lead to people being able to purchase a train ticket to watch a game in this country that remains valid even if the game is moved. Allin-Khan calls it the Fans\u2019 Fare travel scheme and, having received the backing of more than 100 supporters\u2019 groups and the Football Supporters\u2019 Federation, she will discuss it further with the transport minister, Andrew Jones, at a meeting on Tuesday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90ddcf2a39d4dbd6a3f364c06641c2e8884b772c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90ddcf2a39d4dbd6a3f364c06641c2e8884b772c/572_718_5044_3026/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A TransPennine Express train crossing the viaduct at Brownhill, Dobcross.

The 42-year-old will also outline how it could work in practice.</p> <p>\u201cThe [match-going] ticket could be bought online like any other rail ticket,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cThe person buying it would need proof they are doing so to watch live football but that could be something as simple as a code issued by their club. In this day and age, a digital system to help with the necessary identification should be straightforward enough.\u201d</p> <p>The FSF shares Allin-Khan\u2019s belief that supporters should be involved in the discussions regarding the new rail policy and has called for its scope to be extended beyond the top flight. As Malcolm Clarke, the FSF\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cThere are almost as many EFL and National League games moved for TV as Premier League.\u201d</p> <p>The organisation\u2019s chief executive, Kevin Miles, also has an idea regarding how the policy could work in practice: a supporters\u2019 railcard. \u201cYou apply for it at the start of a season, perhaps through a membership scheme, and supporters display it alongside their original rail ticket whenever they undertake a journey caused by their team\u2019s match being rearranged,\u201d he said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve had to buy brand new tickets and apply for a refund on the original ones. As things stand, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll get it</p> <footer> <cite>James Longworth, Burnley supporter</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another possibility is the system used in regions across Germany, such as Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia, whereby a person\u2019s match ticket is also their ticket for use of transport in that area and remains so even if the match is rearranged. Whether that could work across Britain is hard to say but it is at least a potential solution to an undoubted problem.</p> <p>Watching live football on these shores can be expensive and one way to keep costs down is by purchasing rail tickets in advance. The earlier they are booked the cheaper they are, hence Longworth organising his and his friends\u2019 a month before Burnley\u2019s trip to St James\u2019 Park. And he got a decent price: \u00a3190 for six return tickets. Ultimately, it proved a waste of time and money.</p> <p>\u201cWe booked the tickets with TransPennine Express and couldn\u2019t exchange them for ones on the same train a day earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve had to buy brand new tickets and apply for a refund on the original ones. As things stand, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p> <p>There will be other fans, of Newcastle as well as Burnley, who have been hit in the same way, while other match-goers will have similar tales \u2013 including, almost certainly, followers of Leicester and Crystal Palace after their contest at the King Power Stadium on Saturday had been <a href=\"https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2019/january/time-change-for-two-palace-fixtures/\" title=\"\">moved from a 3pm to a 5.30pm kick-off</a> by BT Sport late last month and again because of its need to fill a slot created by Manchester City\u2019s involvement in the Carabao Cup final. </p> <p>BT Sport describes the process of scheduling fixtures as \u201cextremely complex\u201d, and although that is no doubt true there does at times appear to be a poor level of planning, and decision making, by the broadcasters, with a knock-on blow felt by those who help make \u201cthe product\u201d what it is. As Longworth put it: \u201cIt\u2019s match-going fans who generate the atmosphere that makes English football so watchable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe welcome this issue being addressed,\u201d said Miles. \u201cIt\u2019s a longstanding one that has got worse as more games have been televised across more kick-off times. Not for the first time, supporters feel they are being taken advantage of.\u201d</p>",

BT Sport could have chosen to show live coverage of another of the games taking place that evening \u2013 Cardiff v Everton, Huddersfield v Wolves, Leicester v Brighton \u2013 but instead shifted Newcastle v Burnley from its Wednesday slot. Asked to explain the decision, a spokesman for BT Sport said it could not show Leicester v Brighton as it had \u201calready maxed out our Leicester picks\u201d, but there were no reasons for not showing either of the other games, with the spokesman adding: \u201cWhen making game selections we will always aim to choose the strongest game available for us.\u201d In other words, Newcastle v Burnley was moved because, as a game which at the time was a genuine \u2018relegation six-pointer\u2019, it made commercial sense to do so. It is often the way and unlikely to change given the influence broadcasters who pay to show live football in this country \u2013 BT Sport, Sky Sports and BBC \u2013 have on scheduling. But something can be done to help affected supporters, and that is what finally appears to be happening. Following two years of campaigning by the shadow sports minister, Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, the government announced this month that it had agreed to work with the Premier League, British Transport Police and the rail companies to create a policy that would lead to people being able to purchase a train ticket to watch a game in this country that remains valid even if the game is moved. Allin-Khan calls it the Fans\u2019 Fare travel scheme and, having received the backing of more than 100 supporters\u2019 groups and the Football Supporters\u2019 Federation, she will discuss it further with the transport minister, Andrew Jones, at a meeting on Tuesday. \u201cAs a football fan, I know how frustrating it is when you organise rail travel to a game only for the date of that game to be changed,\u201d said Allin-Khan, who in her meeting with Jones will call for supporters to be part of the discussion process for the new rail policy. The 42-year-old will also outline how it could work in practice. \u201cThe [match-going] ticket could be bought online like any other rail ticket,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cThe person buying it would need proof they are doing so to watch live football but that could be something as simple as a code issued by their club. In this day and age, a digital system to help with the necessary identification should be straightforward enough.\u201d The FSF shares Allin-Khan\u2019s belief that supporters should be involved in the discussions regarding the new rail policy and has called for its scope to be extended beyond the top flight. As Malcolm Clarke, the FSF\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cThere are almost as many EFL and National League games moved for TV as Premier League.\u201d The organisation\u2019s chief executive, Kevin Miles, also has an idea regarding how the policy could work in practice: a supporters\u2019 railcard. \u201cYou apply for it at the start of a season, perhaps through a membership scheme, and supporters display it alongside their original rail ticket whenever they undertake a journey caused by their team\u2019s match being rearranged,\u201d he said. Another possibility is the system used in regions across Germany, such as Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia, whereby a person\u2019s match ticket is also their ticket for use of transport in that area and remains so even if the match is rearranged. Whether that could work across Britain is hard to say but it is at least a potential solution to an undoubted problem. Watching live football on these shores can be expensive and one way to keep costs down is by purchasing rail tickets in advance. The earlier they are booked the cheaper they are, hence Longworth organising his and his friends\u2019 a month before Burnley\u2019s trip to St James\u2019 Park. And he got a decent price: \u00a3190 for six return tickets. Ultimately, it proved a waste of time and money. \u201cWe booked the tickets with TransPennine Express and couldn\u2019t exchange them for ones on the same train a day earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve had to buy brand new tickets and apply for a refund on the original ones. As things stand, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll get it.\u201d There will be other fans, of Newcastle as well as Burnley, who have been hit in the same way, while other match-goers will have similar tales \u2013 including, almost certainly, followers of Leicester and Crystal Palace after their contest at the King Power Stadium on Saturday had been moved from a 3pm to a 5.30pm kick-off by BT Sport late last month and again because of its need to fill a slot created by Manchester City\u2019s involvement in the Carabao Cup final. BT Sport describes the process of scheduling fixtures as \u201cextremely complex\u201d, and although that is no doubt true there does at times appear to be a poor level of planning, and decision making, by the broadcasters, with a knock-on blow felt by those who help make \u201cthe product\u201d what it is. As Longworth put it: \u201cIt\u2019s match-going fans who generate the atmosphere that makes English football so watchable.\u201d \u201cWe welcome this issue being addressed,\u201d said Miles. \u201cIt\u2019s a longstanding one that has got worse as more games have been televised across more kick-off times. Not for the first time, supporters feel they are being taken advantage of.\u201d",

The newspaper accepted there was no truth to its claims that the politician, who is also a practicing doctor, had put his hand up the skirts of colleagues. The allegations were made in two Sunday Times articles published at the height of the #MeToo scandal in late 2017, during which several MPs were accused of inappropriate behaviour. The articles were based on accusations made by Andrew Bridgen, a fellow Conservative MP, who alleged he had gone to the Tory whips office about Poulter in 2010 and that no action had been taken. The articles prompted the Conservative party to launch an internal investigation into Poulter. It dismissed the accusations and said there was no reliable evidence to support the complaint since no female MPs had made any complaint about Poulter to the party, with the case instead relying on claims made by Bridgen. Poulter, a former junior health minister who is now a backbencher, launched legal proceedings against the newspaper to clear his name. The Sunday Times initially argued it had not claimed Poulter was guilty of sexual assault but was simply reporting the accusations against the Tory MP. However, the high court later ruled that the stories implied Poulter was guilty of sexual assault, prompting the newspaper to settle and admit that the claims were false and should not have been published.

We start with Amelia reading the Delmore Schwartz poem Calmly We Walk through This April\u2019s Day, as Hays observes \u2013 then we switch to the back seat of Hoyt\u2019s car.</p> <h2>\u2018You got in the car. You know what this is about\u2019</h2> <p>We find out Hoyt was in the army during the Korean war, and that his CCTV camera captured Hays and West\u2019s car following Harris James off the Hoyt property. Hays won\u2019t tell the truth when pushed by Hoyt, who is drinking and seems on edge. Hays turns the tables and tries to pin Hoyt down with the information they\u2019ve discovered \u2013 Dan O\u2019Brien, James being in Las Vegas when Lucy overdosed. But Hoyt isn\u2019t daft. There was a GPS tracker in James\u2019 car and he has the coordinates of his last location. He\u2019ll reveal that location to interested parties, he says, unless Hays stops the investigation. Hays reluctantly accepts, but just wants to know what happened: \u201cDo I look like a man with answers?\u201d replies Hoyt, exasperated.</p> <p>In 2015, West and Hays are quizzing James\u2019 wife about his one-eyed pal. Apparently, Watts AKA Mr June stopped by the James residence a few weeks after the cops killed him and asked about Julie Purcell and whether or not James had found her. He introduced himself as Julius \u2013 Julius Watts, West bets. The pair head to the Hoyt house and find the pink room. It\u2019s untouched and shows a picture \u2013 apparently drawn by Julie of her, Watts and \u2018Queen Isabel\u2019. West\u2019s old pal at the DMZ got him an address for Watts, and the ageing detectives pay a visit. He\u2019s been waiting for them, he says. He was the man in the car. \u201cY\u2019all here to kill me?\u201d he asks. No, they want answers.</p> <p>He\u2019s known Hoyt since he started in the chicken trade, then eventually became close to the family and helped raise Isabel. Things changed after her husband and daughter were killed in an accident. She became dependent on lithium. Julie comes into the mix when Isabel spots her at a family picnic and wants her to become a surrogate for her own daughter. Watts approaches Lucy to ask if it\u2019s OK for Isabel to play with Julie, with Will along for the ride \u2013 and a fee, which Lucy collected. Will\u2019s death was an accident, according to Watts. Isabel had stopped taking her medicine and thought Julie was her own daughter, Mary. During a game of hide and seek with Will, she tussled with him and he slipped, banged his head on a rock. Watts placed him in the cave. He called Harris James to plant the evidence and cover up the crime. Isabel drugged Julie with lithium to confuse her. Watts helped Julie escape when she had grown up, while Isabel killed herself. In 1997, \u2018Mary July\u2019 turned up in a convent. She had HIV and died within a few months of being in the clinic, a sister tells us. Watts doesn\u2019t want to live with the truth any more, he says. He either wants them to kill him or arrest him. They refuse to do either. He needs to live with his part in it.</p> <h2>\u2018Let\u2019s put this thing down. It\u2019s not ours\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c475257c4cd7b1473445414bf263ef9d97529f03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c475257c4cd7b1473445414bf263ef9d97529f03/0_0_5196_3118/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Furious ...West and Hays in a stand-off.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Furious ... West is angry at Hays for chucking away his career.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Home Box Office (HBO)/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1980, we find out what cost Hays his first shot at a career. A newspaper piece said a source close to the investigation cast doubt on the original conviction. Amelia used Hays, it seems, and he won\u2019t do what his superiors want and disown her account and the report. West is furious. He\u2019s as angry at Hays for choosing Amelia over him as he is at him chucking away his career. Hays and Amelia meet up to discuss the article. He gives Amelia her things in a box; it looks like the end. \u201cYou\u2019re the asshole,\u201d Hays says. She used him, and after 12 years of grafting he\u2019s answering public information queries. He feels worked over. They meet again at the veterans bar. Amelia wants to see if he meant what he said earlier. He\u2019s sorry and wants to marry her.</p> <p>A decade later, Hays and Amelia meet in a bar to discuss what happened the night he murdered James and what happened with Hoyt. She thinks he\u2019s having an affair; he tells her his career imploded because of what he told her in 1980. He doesn\u2019t want to give her more information. What\u2019s more, he believes their whole marriage is intertwined in the Purcell case. They never really knew each other, says Amelia. They\u2019ve drifted apart, she adds. He became trapped in the army and then the police. They should both quit, says Hays. Amelia can write books about other cases, and Hays can do \u201calmost anything,\u201d according to his wife. It\u2019s a beautiful moment, but doesn\u2019t feel like the end of their story. Meanwhile, West gets into an epic bar brawl and is befriended by a dog in what is possibly the worst moment in the whole series.</p> <h2>The end</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e833d8556c691d9b7fa6ab5c28aa3572e08893d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e833d8556c691d9b7fa6ab5c28aa3572e08893d/0_346_5196_3118/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will Henry continue the Hays fascination with the Purcell story?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Henry continue the Hays fascination with the Purcell story?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Home Box Office (HBO)/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hays and West are going to live together. Becca is coming to visit and things seem sorted. But Hays has one more case to solve. At the convent, old man Hays and old man West met a groundskeeper named Mike. That\u2019s the same boy Amelia taught back in 1980, who now has his own child named Lucy. He took Julie\u2019s death particularly hard, but met her again when she came to live at the convent and he was a young man working there as his father had done. A vision of Amelia tells Hays that Julie didn\u2019t actually die. The nuns protected her, making up her death to make the trail go cold. When Hays tracks down Julie, he forgets why he\u2019s there and Henry and Becca come to pick him up. Henry finds the address his father wrote down \u2013 could he continue the Hays fascination with the Purcell story? We won\u2019t find out this series as the family all congregate for dinner and we get an overly simplistic happy ending.</p> <h2>Notes and observations</h2> <p>\u2022 Getting Michael Rooker to play Hoyt was a nice move. Grisly, stubborn and always quietly menacing, he fit the bill nicely.</p> <p>\u2022 Did anyone else think Rust Cohle might have been in that car instead of Watts? Would have made things a bit more interesting.</p> <p>\u2022 West doing a Chuck Norris in the bar was excellent. But that dog, can we talk about that dog? At one point I genuinely thought it was going to start talking to him. A very strange scene.</p> <p>\u2022 Did you spot that the nun at the 2015 convent was the runaway Julie knew from earlier in the season? She knew about Ms Isabel and about the forces out to find Julie.</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cYou deserved better than this,\u201d was a quote that could be applied to a lot of things in this series. It was the first good piece of TV in 2019, but it was a long way from great. I found myself cringing at points in this final episode. It just felt too straightforward.</p> <p>Thank you all for your contributions. I hope I\u2019ve guided you through events like Hays in a Vietnamese jungle. I\u2019ve added that Cassandra Wilson song to the Spotify playlist \u2013 thanks for everyone who subscribed. Let me know any suggestions to songs that fit the themes and I\u2019ll stick them on there too.</p>",

Watts helped Julie escape when she had grown up, while Isabel killed herself. In 1997, \u2018Mary July\u2019 turned up in a convent. She had HIV and died within a few months of being in the clinic, a sister tells us. Watts doesn\u2019t want to live with the truth any more, he says. He either wants them to kill him or arrest him. They refuse to do either. He needs to live with his part in it. \u2018Let\u2019s put this thing down. It\u2019s not ours\u2019 In 1980, we find out what cost Hays his first shot at a career. A newspaper piece said a source close to the investigation cast doubt on the original conviction. Amelia used Hays, it seems, and he won\u2019t do what his superiors want and disown her account and the report. West is furious. He\u2019s as angry at Hays for choosing Amelia over him as he is at him chucking away his career. Hays and Amelia meet up to discuss the article. He gives Amelia her things in a box; it looks like the end. \u201cYou\u2019re the asshole,\u201d Hays says. She used him, and after 12 years of grafting he\u2019s answering public information queries. He feels worked over. They meet again at the veterans bar. Amelia wants to see if he meant what he said earlier. He\u2019s sorry and wants to marry her. A decade later, Hays and Amelia meet in a bar to discuss what happened the night he murdered James and what happened with Hoyt. She thinks he\u2019s having an affair; he tells her his career imploded because of what he told her in 1980. He doesn\u2019t want to give her more information. What\u2019s more, he believes their whole marriage is intertwined in the Purcell case. They never really knew each other, says Amelia. They\u2019ve drifted apart, she adds. He became trapped in the army and then the police. They should both quit, says Hays. Amelia can write books about other cases, and Hays can do \u201calmost anything,\u201d according to his wife. It\u2019s a beautiful moment, but doesn\u2019t feel like the end of their story. Meanwhile, West gets into an epic bar brawl and is befriended by a dog in what is possibly the worst moment in the whole series. The end Hays and West are going to live together. Becca is coming to visit and things seem sorted. But Hays has one more case to solve. At the convent, old man Hays and old man West met a groundskeeper named Mike. That\u2019s the same boy Amelia taught back in 1980, who now has his own child named Lucy. He took Julie\u2019s death particularly hard, but met her again when she came to live at the convent and he was a young man working there as his father had done. A vision of Amelia tells Hays that Julie didn\u2019t actually die. The nuns protected her, making up her death to make the trail go cold. When Hays tracks down Julie, he forgets why he\u2019s there and Henry and Becca come to pick him up. Henry finds the address his father wrote down \u2013 could he continue the Hays fascination with the Purcell story? We won\u2019t find out this series as the family all congregate for dinner and we get an overly simplistic happy ending. Notes and observations \u2022 Getting Michael Rooker to play Hoyt was a nice move. Grisly, stubborn and always quietly menacing, he fit the bill nicely. \u2022 Did anyone else think Rust Cohle might have been in that car instead of Watts? Would have made things a bit more interesting. \u2022 West doing a Chuck Norris in the bar was excellent. But that dog, can we talk about that dog? At one point I genuinely thought it was going to start talking to him. A very strange scene. \u2022 Did you spot that the nun at the 2015 convent was the runaway Julie knew from earlier in the season? She knew about Ms Isabel and about the forces out to find Julie. \u2022 \u201cYou deserved better than this,\u201d was a quote that could be applied to a lot of things in this series. It was the first good piece of TV in 2019, but it was a long way from great. I found myself cringing at points in this final episode. It just felt too straightforward. Thank you all for your contributions. I hope I\u2019ve guided you through events like Hays in a Vietnamese jungle. I\u2019ve added that Cassandra Wilson song to the Spotify playlist \u2013 thanks for everyone who subscribed. Let me know any suggestions to songs that fit the themes and I\u2019ll stick them on there too.",

There are doubts, however, in EU capitals about the chances of MPs being won over by the extra guarantees, with discussions taking place over the length of the extension that Brussels might grant the UK should a request be received. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, expressed the EU\u2019s determination to avoid granting a short extension only to have to repeatedly revisit the issue due to a lack of direction in London.

Over the weekend, three cabinet minsters demanded the prime minister stop using the threat of a no-deal Brexit as a negotiating tactic. On Wednesday, an amendment is due to be tabled by former Labour and Conservative cabinet ministers Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin, which would instruct May to seek an extension of article 50 if she does not have a deal ratified by 13 March. May is due to update the Commons on Brexit on Tuesday after her return from the talks with other EU leaders in Egypt. Asked if she could announce an extension to article 50, Ellwood said: \u201cYou need to wait and hear what she has to say when she gets back.\u201d Pressed to clarify whether he knew a delay would be announced, Ellwood said: \u201cThat I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m encouraging that to happen because it is not in anybody\u2019s interest to see no deal affecting Britain in the way that we are talking about.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\ufeffTensions between Cyprus and Turkey over energy could soon come to a head, with ExxonMobil apparently poised to announce a significant natural gas find off the divided island\u2019s southern coast.</p> <p>After more than three months of deep-water exploration in the eastern Mediterranean, the US firm is expected to unveil findings this week in what is being described as a seminal moment in the race to tap potentially profitable underwater resources.</p> <p>Charles Ellinas, an industry expert and former head of Cyprus\u2019s national hydrocarbons company, said: \u201cAll the seismic data suggests that enough has been found to excite ExxonMobil to continue exploration. Potentially there could be great reserves.\u201d</p> <p>But stakes could not be higher in the region. Amid escalating friction over the potential offshore energy find, Turkey has declared it will dispatch its own drilling ships to the area, a year after deploying gunboats to stop the Italian company Eni exploring for offshore wealth at the behest of Greek Cypriots.</p> <p>Last week Ankara said natural resources in the eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean, where tensions have also risen with Greece, remained \u201ca strategic goal and national issue\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn the coming days we will start drilling with two ships around Cyprus,\u201d said the Turkish foreign minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, ratcheting up the rhetoric. \u201cLet those who come to the region from far away, and their companies, see that nothing can be done in that region without us. Nothing can be done in the Mediterranean without Turkey; we will not allow it.\u201d</p> <p>Gas fields were first discovered in waters off Cyprus in 2011. ExxonMobil, one of five international oil companies exploring around the island, has focused on Block 10, adjacent to Egypt\u2019s giant Zohr field, which is believed to be the most promising of all the licensed areas.</p> <p>If unlocked, the deposits beneath the seabed could radically reshape energy geopolitics and \u2013 western politicians hope \u2013 ultimately lessen Europe\u2019s reliance on Russia for gas.</p> <p>In ethnically split Cyprus, the prospect of an energy bonanza is also seen as a potential game changer that could help reconcile the island\u2019s rival Greek and Turkish communities.</p> <p>\u201cIf there is a big find, there\u2019ll be big stakes backed up by a huge American company,\u201d said Hubert Faustmann, a professor of history and political science at the University of Nicosia. \u201cIt could be a blessing that will help end the seemingly intractable Cyprus problem. Even without a solution, there will be a lot of pressure to allow exploitation of the hydrocarbons.\u201d</p> <p>But with Ankara disputing Nicosia\u2019s maritime jurisdiction in seas riven with competing claims over boundaries \u2013 and increasingly incensed over energy agreements the island has signed with Greece, Israel and Egypt \u2013 a major discovery could also trigger other dynamics.<strong> </strong>In the worst-case scenario, military conflict could break out, analysts believe.</p> <p>\u201cThe situation is escalating rather than de-escalating because Turkey is determined to stop exploitation of any resources in Cyprus\u2019 exclusive economic zone (EEZ) without its consent and if Turkish Cypriots don\u2019t also benefit from them,\u201d Faustmann said.</p> <p>Although experts caution that the reserves\u2019 commerciality is still far from assured, an air of optimism has filled Nicosia\u2019s colonial-era presidential palace.

      "bodyText": "\ufeffTensions between Cyprus and Turkey over energy could soon come to a head, with ExxonMobil apparently poised to announce a significant natural gas find off the divided island\u2019s southern coast. After more than three months of deep-water exploration in the eastern Mediterranean, the US firm is expected to unveil findings this week in what is being described as a seminal moment in the race to tap potentially profitable underwater resources. Charles Ellinas, an industry expert and former head of Cyprus\u2019s national hydrocarbons company, said: \u201cAll the seismic data suggests that enough has been found to excite ExxonMobil to continue exploration. Potentially there could be great reserves.\u201d But stakes could not be higher in the region. Amid escalating friction over the potential offshore energy find, Turkey has declared it will dispatch its own drilling ships to the area, a year after deploying gunboats to stop the Italian company Eni exploring for offshore wealth at the behest of Greek Cypriots. Last week Ankara said natural resources in the eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean, where tensions have also risen with Greece, remained \u201ca strategic goal and national issue\u201d. \u201cIn the coming days we will start drilling with two ships around Cyprus,\u201d said the Turkish foreign minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, ratcheting up the rhetoric. \u201cLet those who come to the region from far away, and their companies, see that nothing can be done in that region without us. Nothing can be done in the Mediterranean without Turkey; we will not allow it.\u201d Gas fields were first discovered in waters off Cyprus in 2011. ExxonMobil, one of five international oil companies exploring around the island, has focused on Block 10, adjacent to Egypt\u2019s giant Zohr field, which is believed to be the most promising of all the licensed areas. If unlocked, the deposits beneath the seabed could radically reshape energy geopolitics and \u2013 western politicians hope \u2013 ultimately lessen Europe\u2019s reliance on Russia for gas. In ethnically split Cyprus, the prospect of an energy bonanza is also seen as a potential game changer that could help reconcile the island\u2019s rival Greek and Turkish communities. \u201cIf there is a big find, there\u2019ll be big stakes backed up by a huge American company,\u201d said Hubert Faustmann, a professor of history and political science at the University of Nicosia. \u201cIt could be a blessing that will help end the seemingly intractable Cyprus problem. Even without a solution, there will be a lot of pressure to allow exploitation of the hydrocarbons.\u201d But with Ankara disputing Nicosia\u2019s maritime jurisdiction in seas riven with competing claims over boundaries \u2013 and increasingly incensed over energy agreements the island has signed with Greece, Israel and Egypt \u2013 a major discovery could also trigger other dynamics. In the worst-case scenario, military conflict could break out, analysts believe. \u201cThe situation is escalating rather than de-escalating because Turkey is determined to stop exploitation of any resources in Cyprus\u2019 exclusive economic zone (EEZ) without its consent and if Turkish Cypriots don\u2019t also benefit from them,\u201d Faustmann said. Although experts caution that the reserves\u2019 commerciality is still far from assured, an air of optimism has filled Nicosia\u2019s colonial-era presidential palace. Some officials go as far as to speak of the European Union\u2019s easternmost member becoming a \u201cnew Kuwait\u201d, enriched by its role as a gas-producing hub. \u201cIf it is a substantial reserve, a lot of things are going to change,\u201d said the government spokesman Prodromos Prodromou, conceding that underwater resources could be decisive in breaking the impasse in talks to reunify the island. \u201cA find of some magnitude could act as an incentive for Turkey to discuss a solution and compromise, but it is true the reaction could also be negative. [Turkey\u2019s president] Erdo\u011fan is unpredictable.\u201d Cyprus has been partitioned between Turks in the north and a majority Greek population in the south since a short-lived coup, inspired by Athens and aimed at union with Greece, sparked Ankara to order a full-scale invasion in 1974. After seizing the island\u2019s northern third, up to 40,000 Turkish troops were stationed in the enclave, and Turkish Cypriots unilaterally proclaimde independence in 1981.

      "body": "<p>The first goal arrived after 17 seconds, the last in the 101st minute. There were six in total, including a gorgeous left-foot finish by Matteo Politano and an even better <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1099779849340796928\">free-kick from Luis Muriel</a>. Fiorentina\u2019s 3-3 draw with Inter was endless drama: featuring an own goal, two penalties and some glorious football \u2013 from Radja Nainggolan\u2019s volleyed assist through to Federico Chiesa\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1099760911471001601\">goose down-soft cushioning touch</a>.</p> \n<p>All of which was overshadowed by the Video Assistant Referee.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/25/borussia-dortmund-bundesliga-leaders-win-again-leverkusen-football\">Dogged Dortmund go back to the future and find a way to win again | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>We ought not to blame Michael Fabbri. The official in the VAR booth was only doing his job in a match packed with tight calls. Still, it felt as though a tone was set on the second goal. Matias Vecino pulled Inter level at 1-1 in the sixth minute \u2013 after Stefan De Vrij had deflected the ball into his own net \u2013 but the restart was delayed by a further three as Fabbri made sure there had been no offside in the build-up.</p> \n<p>The long pause provoked impatient whistles, but what followed would aggravate the home crowd far more. After Politano put Inter in front, the visitors were handed an opportunity to extend their advantage at the start of the second half.</p> \n<p>Although the referee, Rosario Abisso, missed it in real-time, replays showed Edimilson Fernandes raising his arm to a Marcelo Brozovic free-kick. Fabbri alerted his colleague, and a penalty was awarded following a pitchside review. Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107 converted from 12 yards.</p> \n<p>Fiorentina, to their credit, refused to yield. Muriel and Marko Pjaca were quickly sent on in place of Marco Benassi and Giovanni Simeone, reinvigorating the attack. The former player was right at the thick of things in the 60th minute, taking a pass from Jordan Veretout near the penalty spot before being dispossessed. The ball ran to Cristiano Biraghi, who buried a shot into the roof of the net.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Celebrations were stifled by another review. Once again, the process dragged on for too long. Finally, Abisso ruled the goal out. Replays showed that Muriel had fouled Danilo D\u2019Ambrosio, following through into the defender\u2019s shin as he attempted to shoot on the turn.</p> \n<p>For spectators watching on TV, the evidence was clear. There was no such transparency available to most inside the ground. Muriel\u2019s sensational free-kick brought Fiorentina back into the game at 3-2, but a sense of injustice continued to prevail, right up until the home team won a penalty of their own in the sixth minute of injury time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1099779849340796928\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">| GOAAAAL! |<br><br>WHAT A STRIKE! \ud83d\udd25<br><br>Luis Muriel scores a screamer of a free kick for Fiorentina \ud83c\udfaf <a href=\"https://t.co/mG5exvDaGZ\">pic.twitter.com/mG5exvDaGZ</a></p>\u2014 Eleven Sports (@ElevenSports_UK) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1099779849340796928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 24, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>It was a poor decision. Chiesa\u2019s cross had struck D\u2019Ambrosio flush on the chest, before maybe skimming off his shoulder from there. Fabbri once more advised Abisso to take a second look. The referee did, before defiantly sticking with his initial call.</p> \n<p>Inter\u2019s bench was livid. Coaches and substitutes had caught the replay on the pitchside monitor. But Jordan Veretout stayed calm to convert the penalty, a mere five minutes after it had been awarded. It was the latest that any goal had been scored in a Serie A match since Opta started keeping records in 2004. De Vrij\u2019s own-goal opener was the fastest.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1099788663196667907\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">| \ud83d\ude31 |<br><br>Fiorentina are given a penalty in the 99th minute!<br><br>Jordan Veretout tucks it away to end the game 3-3, what a game! \ud83d\ude2f <a href=\"https://t.co/TOjtMtWC3O\">pic.twitter.com/TOjtMtWC3O</a></p>\u2014 Eleven Sports (@ElevenSports_UK) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1099788663196667907?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 24, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>At full-time, Roberto Gagliardini \u2013 an unused substitute for Inter \u2013 rushed onto the pitch to confront Abisso with a further replay on his phone. Luciano Spalletti repeated the words \u201ca clear chest\u201d over and over in post-match interviews.</p> \n<p>Stefano Pioli was, unsurprisingly, able to reflect more calmly. The Fiorentina manager suggested that he would not have given either penalty but observed that this is a season in which handball decisions come easily. His team, as he reminded us, had been penalised for a ball that barely brushed the fingers of Vitor Hugo when they faced Inter for the first time back in September.</p> \n<p>Most poignant might have been his observation that this was a match \u201cWhere we played little and watched a lot of VAR.\u201d The fact that a penalty could be awarded so deep into injury time was an indication of how greatly this game was disrupted already by the various VAR interventions.</p> \n<p>Opinions on the use of technology remain fiercely divided. There are those who resent the disruption to the game, and those who believe that delays can be tolerated as long as the final outcome is correct.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n  <br>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The greatest frustrations will always arise on occasions such as this, when even a lengthy review failed to ensure that justice was done. As Spalletti pointed out, these are moments that impact careers. \u201cWith a result like this, tomorrow, people will be back to talking about \u2018Spalletti is on his way out; this guy is coming in [to replace him as manager], or that other guy,\u2019\u201d he protested. \u201cI\u2019m 60 years old, these are fundamental matches, the results are decisive.\u201d</p> \n<p>On balance of play, a draw felt fair, but that is not how we decide football matches. Inter had been on course for a fifth consecutive victory across all competitions, as well as their first away triumph over Fiorentina since 2014.</p> \n<p>A win would have maintained their advantage over Milan and Roma in the chase for Champions League places. Instead, the gap to the Rossoneri, in fourth, is down to two points. Roma are just one behind that, in fifth. Fiorentina lost ground, too, in their efforts to claim a Europa League spot.</p> \n<p>Both teams played well enough through phases of this game to believe that their respective targets remain achievable. They each also conceded three goals. The vexation with VAR is justified, yet it is still true that not all mistakes were beyond their control.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YdmZ7PtZfc\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-YdmZ7PtZfc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 The Mauro Icardi saga continues to roll on for Inter, with Politano mimicking the Argentinian\u2019s hands-behind-ears celebration after his goal. Ivan Perisic appeared to take umbrage, slapping one hand away and exchanging a few words with his team-mate though, in truth, nobody really knows what was said and it looked to me like a situation open to over-interpretation. Wanda Nara made sure the incident wasn\u2019t missed, however, bringing it up on her evening appearance on Tiki Taka. \u201cThere are many injustices in football,\u201d she said. \u201cLike Fiorentina\u2019s penalty, Perisic\u2019s behaviour after Politano\u2019s goal, or keeping Icardi at home with all this pain that he has.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 Massimiliano Allegri kept his glass half full, insisting he was content with a 1-0 win over Bologna that maintained Juventus\u2019s 13-point advantage over Napoli going into their head-to-head next weekend. Fans might have been hoping for more of a reaction following the midweek defeat by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Bologna, 18th in the table, albeit reinvigorated by the recent appointment of Sinisa Mihajlovic as manager, had more possession and three times as many shots as the champions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRIvku1SAoc\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kRIvku1SAoc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 A fifth consecutive clean sheet for Torino, but also one of their best performances going forward this season as they beat Atalanta 2-0.

      "bodyText": "The first goal arrived after 17 seconds, the last in the 101st minute. There were six in total, including a gorgeous left-foot finish by Matteo Politano and an even better free-kick from Luis Muriel. Fiorentina\u2019s 3-3 draw with Inter was endless drama: featuring an own goal, two penalties and some glorious football \u2013 from Radja Nainggolan\u2019s volleyed assist through to Federico Chiesa\u2019s goose down-soft cushioning touch. All of which was overshadowed by the Video Assistant Referee. We ought not to blame Michael Fabbri. The official in the VAR booth was only doing his job in a match packed with tight calls. Still, it felt as though a tone was set on the second goal. Matias Vecino pulled Inter level at 1-1 in the sixth minute \u2013 after Stefan De Vrij had deflected the ball into his own net \u2013 but the restart was delayed by a further three as Fabbri made sure there had been no offside in the build-up. The long pause provoked impatient whistles, but what followed would aggravate the home crowd far more. After Politano put Inter in front, the visitors were handed an opportunity to extend their advantage at the start of the second half. Although the referee, Rosario Abisso, missed it in real-time, replays showed Edimilson Fernandes raising his arm to a Marcelo Brozovic free-kick. Fabbri alerted his colleague, and a penalty was awarded following a pitchside review. Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107 converted from 12 yards. Fiorentina, to their credit, refused to yield. Muriel and Marko Pjaca were quickly sent on in place of Marco Benassi and Giovanni Simeone, reinvigorating the attack. The former player was right at the thick of things in the 60th minute, taking a pass from Jordan Veretout near the penalty spot before being dispossessed. The ball ran to Cristiano Biraghi, who buried a shot into the roof of the net. Celebrations were stifled by another review. Once again, the process dragged on for too long. Finally, Abisso ruled the goal out. Replays showed that Muriel had fouled Danilo D\u2019Ambrosio, following through into the defender\u2019s shin as he attempted to shoot on the turn. For spectators watching on TV, the evidence was clear. There was no such transparency available to most inside the ground. Muriel\u2019s sensational free-kick brought Fiorentina back into the game at 3-2, but a sense of injustice continued to prevail, right up until the home team won a penalty of their own in the sixth minute of injury time. It was a poor decision. Chiesa\u2019s cross had struck D\u2019Ambrosio flush on the chest, before maybe skimming off his shoulder from there. Fabbri once more advised Abisso to take a second look. The referee did, before defiantly sticking with his initial call. Inter\u2019s bench was livid. Coaches and substitutes had caught the replay on the pitchside monitor. But Jordan Veretout stayed calm to convert the penalty, a mere five minutes after it had been awarded. It was the latest that any goal had been scored in a Serie A match since Opta started keeping records in 2004. De Vrij\u2019s own-goal opener was the fastest. At full-time, Roberto Gagliardini \u2013 an unused substitute for Inter \u2013 rushed onto the pitch to confront Abisso with a further replay on his phone. Luciano Spalletti repeated the words \u201ca clear chest\u201d over and over in post-match interviews. Stefano Pioli was, unsurprisingly, able to reflect more calmly. The Fiorentina manager suggested that he would not have given either penalty but observed that this is a season in which handball decisions come easily. His team, as he reminded us, had been penalised for a ball that barely brushed the fingers of Vitor Hugo when they faced Inter for the first time back in September. Most poignant might have been his observation that this was a match \u201cWhere we played little and watched a lot of VAR.\u201d The fact that a penalty could be awarded so deep into injury time was an indication of how greatly this game was disrupted already by the various VAR interventions. Opinions on the use of technology remain fiercely divided. There are those who resent the disruption to the game, and those who believe that delays can be tolerated as long as the final outcome is correct. The greatest frustrations will always arise on occasions such as this, when even a lengthy review failed to ensure that justice was done. As Spalletti pointed out, these are moments that impact careers. \u201cWith a result like this, tomorrow, people will be back to talking about \u2018Spalletti is on his way out; this guy is coming in [to replace him as manager], or that other guy,\u2019\u201d he protested. \u201cI\u2019m 60 years old, these are fundamental matches, the results are decisive.\u201d On balance of play, a draw felt fair, but that is not how we decide football matches. Inter had been on course for a fifth consecutive victory across all competitions, as well as their first away triumph over Fiorentina since 2014. A win would have maintained their advantage over Milan and Roma in the chase for Champions League places. Instead, the gap to the Rossoneri, in fourth, is down to two points. Roma are just one behind that, in fifth. Fiorentina lost ground, too, in their efforts to claim a Europa League spot. Both teams played well enough through phases of this game to believe that their respective targets remain achievable. They each also conceded three goals. The vexation with VAR is justified, yet it is still true that not all mistakes were beyond their control. Talking points \u2022 The Mauro Icardi saga continues to roll on for Inter, with Politano mimicking the Argentinian\u2019s hands-behind-ears celebration after his goal. Ivan Perisic appeared to take umbrage, slapping one hand away and exchanging a few words with his team-mate though, in truth, nobody really knows what was said and it looked to me like a situation open to over-interpretation. Wanda Nara made sure the incident wasn\u2019t missed, however, bringing it up on her evening appearance on Tiki Taka. \u201cThere are many injustices in football,\u201d she said. \u201cLike Fiorentina\u2019s penalty, Perisic\u2019s behaviour after Politano\u2019s goal, or keeping Icardi at home with all this pain that he has.\u201d \u2022 Massimiliano Allegri kept his glass half full, insisting he was content with a 1-0 win over Bologna that maintained Juventus\u2019s 13-point advantage over Napoli going into their head-to-head next weekend. Fans might have been hoping for more of a reaction following the midweek defeat by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Bologna, 18th in the table, albeit reinvigorated by the recent appointment of Sinisa Mihajlovic as manager, had more possession and three times as many shots as the champions. \u2022 A fifth consecutive clean sheet for Torino, but also one of their best performances going forward this season as they beat Atalanta 2-0. Andrea Belotti is yet to score a goal in 2019, yet his drought has not prevented Walter Mazzarri\u2019s side from climbing level with this weekend\u2019s opponents in joint-sixth. \u2022 Another week, another goal for Krzysztof Piatek. Across Europe\u2019s top five leagues, only Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Leo Messi, and Cristiano Ronaldo are outpacing him this season.",

Despite <a href=\"http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/the-green-new-deal-has-strong-bipartisan-support/\">polls</a> showing broad bipartisan support for a Green New Deal, McConnell hopes his ploy will divide Democrats and boost the GOP talking point that the plan is fiscally irresponsible.</p> <p>While McConnell and other critics seem to think that they can defeat the Green New Deal by repeating a tired mantra \u2013 \u201c<em>we can\u2019t afford to do it</em>\u201d \u2013 the real question is: <em>how can we afford not to?</em> Without bold action to tackle climate change, toxic pollution and economic and racial inequity, our society will only see rising fiscal burdens. A Green New Deal would not only help us avoid mounting costs \u2013 it also would stimulate broad-based demand in the economy by investing in real drivers of economic prosperity: workers and communities. That\u2019s in stark contrast to the GOP\u2019s expensive recent policy priority \u2013 the nearly $2tn tax cuts of 2018 \u2013 which did little more than enrich stateless mega-corporations and the wealthiest investors.</p> <p>A Green New Deal is first and foremost about justice \u2013 prioritizing working people, communities of color and others who bear the brunt of stagnant wages, polluted air and water, and climate impacts. It\u2019s about acting at the speed and scale that equity and science demand. But if opponents want to debate the plan\u2019s straight economic merits, Green New Deal backers should welcome the opportunity. The plan is also about fiscal foresight.</p> <p>While some people talk about the costs of climate change as far-off hypotheticals, there\u2019s growing evidence that costs are already here. On 6 February, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA released <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news/2018-was-4th-hottest-year-on-record-for-globe\">findings</a> that climate change impacts in 2018 directly resulted in 247 deaths and $91bn in damages. The longer-term fiscal implications are also becoming clearer. In November, 13 US federal agencies reported that, under current emissions trajectories, the US economy would bear more than <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/11/24/18109883/climate-report-2018-national-assessment\">$500bn per year</a> in costs due to labor and agricultural losses, sea level rise and extreme weather impacts by the end of the century. This annual half-trillion-dollar burden didn\u2019t account for many unpredictable second-order costs of climate change, like the implications of mass forced migrations driven by water scarcity and flooding. These are risks that the Pentagon has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/31/pentagon-ranks-global-warming-destabilising-force\">highlighting for a decade</a>.</p> <p>A Green New Deal would help to seriously reduce climate pollution and cut these long-term liabilities, whether by supporting a transition to 100% clean energy, expanding access to clean public transportation, or spurring innovation in clean manufacturing. While some impacts of climate change are now inevitable, a Green New Deal also would help communities mitigate costly damage by investing in urban green spaces to prevent flooding, restoring wetlands to buffer hurricanes, protecting houses from forest fires, and shielding coastlines from sea level rise. In addition to supporting community resilience, this would reduce long-run costs for the federal government and for the states and municipalities that tend to shoulder the biggest burdens in emergencies.</p> <p>Of course, a Green New Deal isn\u2019t just about managing risks \u2013 it\u2019s also about creating economic opportunities. The plan would create millions of jobs with family-sustaining wages for workers whose inflation-adjusted pay hasn\u2019t budged since the 1970s. Whether replacing lead pipes, weatherizing homes, manufacturing components for light rail, or rehabilitating damaged ecosystems, a Green New Deal would put money in the pockets of the workers who are most impacted by rising economic inequality. Given that low-income workers tend to spend more of their available money than the wealthy, this targeted effort to boost working class wages would strengthen growth, reduce the income gap, and ultimately improve the nation\u2019s economic fundamentals.</p> <p>Even people who deny the <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/secular-stagnation/\">evidence</a> that inequality is slowing economic growth must admit that a Green New Deal would address other long-term liabilities. The plan would invest in the kinds of infrastructure upgrades that <a href=\"https://www.ajot.com/news/poll-shows-strong-bipartisan-support-for-broad-infrastructure-initiative\">nearly everyone</a> agrees are needed \u2013 not only to create good jobs, slash pollution and build community resilience, but also to support economic growth. Renewal of our energy, water and transportation infrastructure is long overdue \u2013 and today\u2019s low borrowing costs make the investment all the more prudent. Looking to the long-term, a Green New Deal also would spur innovation and growth in advanced manufacturing through policies like \u201cBuy Clean\u201d that direct tax dollars for public projects to the most efficient, least polluting forms of production.</p> <p>Contrast these forward-looking investments with a spending deal that many opponents of a Green New Deal so ardently championed: the Republican tax cuts of 2018. While backers of the GOP tax package billed it as a vision of fiscal responsibility \u2013 a program that would \u201cpay for itself\u201d according to the treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin \u2013 the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the deal will now add <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/382319-gop-tax-law-will-add-19-trillion-to-debt-cbo\">$1.9tn</a> to the national debt over a decade.</p> <p>And it\u2019s not as if this money has gone toward solving real challenges.

      "bodyText": "Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s decision to enter an electoral pact with a party of ultranationalist extremists has drawn rare criticism from an influential pro-Israel group in the US. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), which has generally given unflinching support to the Israeli leader during his 13 years in power, called the Jewish Power party \u201cracist and reprehensible\u201d. Aipac, which receives Netanyahu as a celebrity, with adoring crowds at conferences, joined a chorus of condemnation worldwide from Jewish and Zionist groups shocked by the agreement with the far-right party. Netanyahu helped orchestrate the merger last week of Jewish Power with another ultranationalist ally, Jewish Home, that would give him a better chance of forming a majority government in an election on 9 April. Aipac retweeted a statement by the American Jewish Committee, another major pro-Israel advocacy group. Although not mentioning Netanyahu by name, it warned that Jewish Power might conceivably enter government under the new deal. \u201cThe views of Otzma Yehudit are reprehensible,\u201d it said, using the group\u2019s Hebrew name. \u201cThey do not reflect the core values that are the very foundation of the State of Israel.\u201d It added that it would be up to Israel\u2019s elections commission to decide if the party could run. A former long-time Aipac official, David Kreizelman, said the group \u201cvery rarely\u201d comments on domestic Israeli politics. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty major. It\u2019s a very strong statement,\u201d he said. Jewish Power\u2019s leaders are ideological successors to Meir Kahane, a US-born rabbi who served one term in parliament 1984. His Kach movement was later banned by Israel and the US under anti-terrorism laws. He advocated for a Jewish theocracy, the expulsion of millions of Palestinians and a ban on sex and marriage between Jews and Arabs. After moving to the US and setting up the militant Jewish Defense League, he was imprisoned for bombmaking and later assassinated in 1990 by an Egyptian-born American gunman. The FBI regards the Jewish Defense League as a rightwing terrorist group after two members attempted to bomb a California mosque. Key Israeli figures in Jewish Power include Baruch Marzel, who has said homosexuality is \u201ca disease of choice\u201d, and Benzi Gopstein, the leader of a pro-segregation group that fights against Jews marrying non-Jews. Another, Itamar Ben Gvir, an attorney who defends Israeli settlers implicated in violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, was convicted in 2007 for inciting racism after holding signs at a protest reading: \u201cExpel the Arab enemy.\u201d In a recent interview, he said Arabs who are \u201cloyal to the state\u201d are welcome. \u201cBut those who are not must be expelled.\u201d A recent poll suggested the alliance might receive as many as five seats in the 120-seat Knesset. Netanyahu has defended his merger as a way to form a rightwing coalition in April and accused his critics of \u201chypocrisy and double standards\u201d. As well as more progressive Zionist groups, who frequently attack Netanyahu, the deal was criticised by more conservative pro-Israel organisations. The Zionist Federation of Australia said it did not typically comment on the internal political machinations of Israel but added: \u201cElectoral gains should never justify sacrificing the very values underpinning the Jewish atate that we, as Diaspora Jewry, are proud to support.\u201d Under Israel\u2019s political system, which strongly favours multi-party coalition governments, the merger will guarantee Netanyahu allies in exchange for two cabinet positions if he wins. Running for a fifth term, the 69-year-old leader has been faced with a growing threat from the former army chief Benny Gantz, whose chances of defeating Israel\u2019s second-longest serving premier have risen after he allied with centrist parties. Gantz said the prime minister was damaging \u201cour important relationship with US jews\u201d. \u201cThe rare reaction by Aipac, an organisation that does not usually touch on internal Israeli politics, proves that Benjamin Netanyahu has once again crossed ethical red lines just to keep his seat while causing serious harm to Israel\u2019s image,\u201d he tweeted. An analysis in the right-leaning Jerusalem Post newspaper, however, said the crisis between Israel and Aipac was being overplayed. \u201cThe next time [Aipac] goes to meet a senator or congressman to lobby for additional funding for Israeli missile-defense projects, it might be asked about Otzma. It needed to take a moral stand now,\u201d it read. It noted that despite the criticism, Aipac announced two days later that it was honoured Netanyahu would address its annual meeting in Washington next month. The piece went on to say: \u201cMore concerning was that Netanyahu showed the world that almost nothing is off-limits in achieving the goal of remaining in power.\u201d",

The business end of the campaign is a period of giddy expectation for supporters of the big boys, though it\u2019s rarely as thrill-packed for fans whose lovable rabble have descended into jaded mid-table irrelevance, without so much as the faint threat of relegation to keep the juices flowing. Thing is, you\u2019ve got to get your kicks somehow. So once again, it\u2019s that time of year when fans across the land hold their nose, take a deep breath, and hitch their wagon to another star.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/25/ten-talking-points-from-the-weekend-football\">Premier League, Carabao Cup and Continental Cup: 10 talking points</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Or, to put it more accurately, decide whose success in the Premier League, FA Cup and Championship would be the least annoying, least unpalatable, least injurious to the central nervous system. Those from the old school will immediately demur, recoiling at the very idea of searching out any result other than their own. But this is not adultery. Or even vicarious glory-hunting. You\u2019re going to be reading about the exploits of all the winners throughout the spring, the summer, and in some cases forever more. It\u2019s only natural that your instinct pursues the path of least resistance. The heart doesn\u2019t want what it doesn\u2019t want.</p> <p>Tribal loyalties will dictate some decisions; you\u2019d have to assume the majority of Old Trafford denizens will be hoping Tottenham taste Premier League glory come May. But what about the genuine neutral who\u2019d struggle to express a preference from the trio of clubs chasing the title? Assuming such a person exists, the subconscious kicks into gear, whereupon vague feelings, half-formed opinions and minor crushes are invested with way more importance than is strictly warranted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps they quite admire the clinical modernity of Pepball, don\u2019t mind the heart-on-the-sleeve passion of J\u00fcrgen Klopp or are fairly impressed by the cheery relentlessness of Son Heung-min. Perhaps they mildly despise the influence of petrodollars, are slightly put off by lachrymose showtune singalongs or would rather not spend all next season listening to Manchester United fans bait their rivals, high on life, whacked off their noggins on schadenfreude. As we\u2019ve known since 23 June 2016, previously insignificant beefs and long-dormant petty personal prejudices, suddenly revived and blown out of all proportion, inform everything nowadays.</p> <p>But this needn\u2019t be a wholly negative pursuit. Plump for a favourite in the title race and you\u2019ll be rewarded with a mild buzz of righteousness should your selection prevail. If that team capitulates in widescreen style \u2013 just like you know your lot would, too \u2013 you\u2019ll feel a warm inclusive glow upon realising crushing failure is not your preserve alone. And what\u2019s that pleasant head rush? Why, it\u2019s thundering indifference, of course. You\u2019ve enjoyed all the benefits of mild distraction during the run-in, but suffered none of the searing existential pain when it all went mammaries-up. You had no real skin in the game. There\u2019s nothing like gambling with house money.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In an ideal world Wembley will host a Swansea-Millwall FA Cup final</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The neutral can be even more generous of spirit as the FA Cup nears its denouement. Unless you want City to win a quadruple to irritate their cross-town rivals, a legitimate stance in some neighbourhoods, surely nobody sound of mind will be cheering for either Manchester team to win it. After all, five of the eight clubs remaining in the competition have never won the famous old pot. Take your pick, though in an ideal world Wembley hosts a Swansea-Millwall final. The reasons for this are three-fold: there hasn\u2019t been a winner from the second tier since West Ham in 1980; Swansea have never reached an FA Cup final; and Millwall have never won a major trophy. Therefore, the Lions to beat the Swans by the odd goal in seven, please.</p> <p>Not that supporting the underdog needs to be the default setting. Of the teams vying for promotion from the Championship, Bristol City stand out. The Robins have enjoyed two brief spells in the top flight. The most recent is mainly remembered for the brazenly uneventful eking-out of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/feb/25/world-cup-25-stunning-moments-no3-germany-austria-1982-rob-smyth\" title=\"\">\u201cDisgrace of Gij\u00f3n\u201d</a>-style draw with Coventry in 1977 that ensured the survival of both teams at the expense of a furious Sunderland. City\u2019s first stint saw them finish second, but that was in 1907, so our neutral may conclude another shot at the big time is long overdue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/24/kepa-chelsea-sarri-carabao-cup-final-manchester-city\">Kepa\u2019s shootout mutiny emblematic of Sarri\u2019s sinking ship at Chelsea | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But who goes up with them?

They\u2019re also the best team in the division, if the way they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/02/leeds-united-norwich-city-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">systematically dismantled Leeds</a> recently is anything to go by. But they\u2019ve had a fair few cracks at the top flight lately. Leeds, by contrast, have suffered more than enough; ditto fellow fallen giants Nottingham Forest. All fair-minded neutrals \u2013 and so many are fair-minded about Leeds \u2013 would love to see these two back, adding extra big-game glamour to the Premier League. Also, we\u2019d be three steps closer to replicating the old First Division of the Football 79 album, a most agreeable realignment of the stars. (Your first-ever Panini album contains all the definitive top-flight clubs, too, right?)</p> <p>Hands up: chances are you consider all of the above to be arrant poppycock. But then that\u2019s the whole point. Your inner neutral will have good reasons of its own and be cranking into gear right about now. Here\u2019s hoping they maintain you, maybe even generate a frisson of excitement, while your true loves amble aimlessly toward the season\u2019s end.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This weekend marked the start of trophy-lifting season in England. The business end of the campaign is a period of giddy expectation for supporters of the big boys, though it\u2019s rarely as thrill-packed for fans whose lovable rabble have descended into jaded mid-table irrelevance, without so much as the faint threat of relegation to keep the juices flowing. Thing is, you\u2019ve got to get your kicks somehow. So once again, it\u2019s that time of year when fans across the land hold their nose, take a deep breath, and hitch their wagon to another star. Or, to put it more accurately, decide whose success in the Premier League, FA Cup and Championship would be the least annoying, least unpalatable, least injurious to the central nervous system. Those from the old school will immediately demur, recoiling at the very idea of searching out any result other than their own. But this is not adultery. Or even vicarious glory-hunting. You\u2019re going to be reading about the exploits of all the winners throughout the spring, the summer, and in some cases forever more. It\u2019s only natural that your instinct pursues the path of least resistance. The heart doesn\u2019t want what it doesn\u2019t want. Tribal loyalties will dictate some decisions; you\u2019d have to assume the majority of Old Trafford denizens will be hoping Tottenham taste Premier League glory come May. But what about the genuine neutral who\u2019d struggle to express a preference from the trio of clubs chasing the title? Assuming such a person exists, the subconscious kicks into gear, whereupon vague feelings, half-formed opinions and minor crushes are invested with way more importance than is strictly warranted. Perhaps they quite admire the clinical modernity of Pepball, don\u2019t mind the heart-on-the-sleeve passion of J\u00fcrgen Klopp or are fairly impressed by the cheery relentlessness of Son Heung-min. Perhaps they mildly despise the influence of petrodollars, are slightly put off by lachrymose showtune singalongs or would rather not spend all next season listening to Manchester United fans bait their rivals, high on life, whacked off their noggins on schadenfreude. As we\u2019ve known since 23 June 2016, previously insignificant beefs and long-dormant petty personal prejudices, suddenly revived and blown out of all proportion, inform everything nowadays. But this needn\u2019t be a wholly negative pursuit. Plump for a favourite in the title race and you\u2019ll be rewarded with a mild buzz of righteousness should your selection prevail. If that team capitulates in widescreen style \u2013 just like you know your lot would, too \u2013 you\u2019ll feel a warm inclusive glow upon realising crushing failure is not your preserve alone. And what\u2019s that pleasant head rush? Why, it\u2019s thundering indifference, of course. You\u2019ve enjoyed all the benefits of mild distraction during the run-in, but suffered none of the searing existential pain when it all went mammaries-up. You had no real skin in the game. There\u2019s nothing like gambling with house money. The neutral can be even more generous of spirit as the FA Cup nears its denouement. Unless you want City to win a quadruple to irritate their cross-town rivals, a legitimate stance in some neighbourhoods, surely nobody sound of mind will be cheering for either Manchester team to win it. After all, five of the eight clubs remaining in the competition have never won the famous old pot. Take your pick, though in an ideal world Wembley hosts a Swansea-Millwall final. The reasons for this are three-fold: there hasn\u2019t been a winner from the second tier since West Ham in 1980; Swansea have never reached an FA Cup final; and Millwall have never won a major trophy. Therefore, the Lions to beat the Swans by the odd goal in seven, please. Not that supporting the underdog needs to be the default setting. Of the teams vying for promotion from the Championship, Bristol City stand out. The Robins have enjoyed two brief spells in the top flight. The most recent is mainly remembered for the brazenly uneventful eking-out of an \u201cDisgrace of Gij\u00f3n\u201d-style draw with Coventry in 1977 that ensured the survival of both teams at the expense of a furious Sunderland. City\u2019s first stint saw them finish second, but that was in 1907, so our neutral may conclude another shot at the big time is long overdue. But who goes up with them? In broad historical terms, Norwich are the next smallest of the competing bunch. They\u2019re also the best team in the division, if the way they systematically dismantled Leeds recently is anything to go by. But they\u2019ve had a fair few cracks at the top flight lately. Leeds, by contrast, have suffered more than enough; ditto fellow fallen giants Nottingham Forest. All fair-minded neutrals \u2013 and so many are fair-minded about Leeds \u2013 would love to see these two back, adding extra big-game glamour to the Premier League. Also, we\u2019d be three steps closer to replicating the old First Division of the Football 79 album, a most agreeable realignment of the stars. (Your first-ever Panini album contains all the definitive top-flight clubs, too, right?) Hands up: chances are you consider all of the above to be arrant poppycock. But then that\u2019s the whole point. Your inner neutral will have good reasons of its own and be cranking into gear right about now. Here\u2019s hoping they maintain you, maybe even generate a frisson of excitement, while your true loves amble aimlessly toward the season\u2019s end.",

It didn\u2019t feel like that, though, after three weeks in which a seven-point lead over Bayern Munich had disappeared, the team had exited the DfB Pokal and slid to the brink of following suit in the Champions League.</p> \n<p>For Borussia Dortmund the final insult was the prospect of former coach Peter Bosz, returning on Sunday with his improving Bayer Leverkusen, \u201cgetting the chance to totally ruin another Dortmund season,\u201d in the words of German journalist Lars Pollmann. Yet while much focus was on the Dutchman, whose new side arrived on the crest of 13 goals in their last four Bundesliga games (at least to some extent echoing his long-forgotten, excellent start at Westfalen 18 months ago), the sense of deja vu eventually came from elsewhere.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/23/european-roundup-lionel-messi-barcelona-javi-martinez-bayern-munich\">European roundup: Sancho scores in Dortmund win as Real given dubious penalty</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThey were better than us,\u201d said Lucien Favre, with customary frankness. He was right. When Dan-Axel Zagadou sidefooted in a corner to give Dortmund a first-half lead, it followed half an hour in which they barely got the ball out of their own half. \u201cThat,\u201d sporting director Michael Zorc said with some understatement, \u201cwas of course not the plan. At home, you want to attack and you want to dominate.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was, however, almost comforting in that it was a return to the first template of early season. As the results mount up the detail fades, but much of Dortmund\u2019s success this term has been built on phenomenal efficiency. If we wind it back to the very first game of the season, where the record books tell us that BVB impressively rolled over a fellow top-four hopeful in Leizpig, closer examination \u2013 or better memory \u2013 tells us they spent long periods of the game soaking up pressure before punishing the visitors on the break. Favre\u2019s post-match assessment after his Bundesliga debut with the club that day? \u201cThey were the better team.\u201d Plus \u00e7a change.</p> \n<p>So while, when Paco Alc\u00e1cer had one ruled out for a fractional offside which would have put Dortmund 4-1 up and Jonathan Tah pulled one back for the visitors to make it 3-2 shortly afterwards, it may have felt like a near-rerun of the previous home game with Hoffenheim, where they shelled that 3-0 lead, it was actually a more common situation. A situation that Dortmund know how to cope with.</p> \n<p>They just had to remind themselves that they could do so after five without a win in all competitions, but that is what they eventually did. The defensive holes that they learned to cover, with a mix of dogged collective application and with that dizzyingly-sprinkled stardust in the final third, are still there. So is Roman B\u00fcrki. He again made key saves at 3-1, from Leon Bailey and Lucas Alario.</p> \n<p>One wonders what Bosz thinks of all this.

      "bodyText": "They were still top, still in charge of their own destiny and, lest we forget amid the jitters, still way ahead of schedule or expectation. It didn\u2019t feel like that, though, after three weeks in which a seven-point lead over Bayern Munich had disappeared, the team had exited the DfB Pokal and slid to the brink of following suit in the Champions League. For Borussia Dortmund the final insult was the prospect of former coach Peter Bosz, returning on Sunday with his improving Bayer Leverkusen, \u201cgetting the chance to totally ruin another Dortmund season,\u201d in the words of German journalist Lars Pollmann. Yet while much focus was on the Dutchman, whose new side arrived on the crest of 13 goals in their last four Bundesliga games (at least to some extent echoing his long-forgotten, excellent start at Westfalen 18 months ago), the sense of deja vu eventually came from elsewhere. \u201cThey were better than us,\u201d said Lucien Favre, with customary frankness. He was right. When Dan-Axel Zagadou sidefooted in a corner to give Dortmund a first-half lead, it followed half an hour in which they barely got the ball out of their own half. \u201cThat,\u201d sporting director Michael Zorc said with some understatement, \u201cwas of course not the plan. At home, you want to attack and you want to dominate.\u201d It was, however, almost comforting in that it was a return to the first template of early season. As the results mount up the detail fades, but much of Dortmund\u2019s success this term has been built on phenomenal efficiency. If we wind it back to the very first game of the season, where the record books tell us that BVB impressively rolled over a fellow top-four hopeful in Leizpig, closer examination \u2013 or better memory \u2013 tells us they spent long periods of the game soaking up pressure before punishing the visitors on the break. Favre\u2019s post-match assessment after his Bundesliga debut with the club that day? \u201cThey were the better team.\u201d Plus \u00e7a change. So while, when Paco Alc\u00e1cer had one ruled out for a fractional offside which would have put Dortmund 4-1 up and Jonathan Tah pulled one back for the visitors to make it 3-2 shortly afterwards, it may have felt like a near-rerun of the previous home game with Hoffenheim, where they shelled that 3-0 lead, it was actually a more common situation. A situation that Dortmund know how to cope with. They just had to remind themselves that they could do so after five without a win in all competitions, but that is what they eventually did. The defensive holes that they learned to cover, with a mix of dogged collective application and with that dizzyingly-sprinkled stardust in the final third, are still there. So is Roman B\u00fcrki. He again made key saves at 3-1, from Leon Bailey and Lucas Alario. One wonders what Bosz thinks of all this. He has largely kept his own counsel, even if his goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky had said that returning to Westfalen and winning would be \u201cextra sweet\u201d for the coach. If he was notoriously inflexible with his tactics \u2013 and the early signs at Leverkusen are that he has learned a lesson or two \u2013 Bosz had bad luck as well. B\u00fcrki suffered the worst form of his Dortmund career under him (unnerved by the coach\u2019s haphazard defensive set-up, some might argue), and the coach pointed out in his Friday pre-match press conference that he was never able to call on Marco Reus, who was recovering from a knee injury during his spell at the helm. With the Dortmund captain being nursed back to health after a thigh strain, missing a fourth straight game here, Bosz got a bit of that luck back, as he acknowledged before the game. His goals and his talismanic presence are missed and Zorc mused that it was \u201cimportant for the players to show themselves they could do it without him.\u201d They hope that state won\u2019t last much longer, and Zorc believes they might have him back to face Augsburg on Friday. If it provestoo soon, there\u2019s no need to panic. The resolve here was clear, even if the fluency wasn\u2019t always so evident. After a thoroughly deserved equaliser for Leverkusen by Kevin Volland, Dortmund simply went straight back up the other end for Jadon Sancho to put them back in front with a superb volley. That passage of play, responding to a setback decisively, gave them the confidence toget what they needed from the game. \u201cWe made one or two mistakes too many to survive here,\u201d lamented the visitors\u2019 Julian Brandt, underlining Leverkusen\u2019s \u2013 and Bosz\u2019s \u2013 standards, and tipping his hat to Dortmund\u2019s qualities. Yet what Favre and company had shown was that mistakes happen. It\u2019s how you react to them that counts. They might just have rediscovered the thread of their successful season, even with its fraying.

After some eight months\u2019 investigation, Ofcom has sent a clear message \u2013 that interrogating victims of sexual assault and compelling them to defend themselves and their actions in the aftermath will not be tolerated in mainstream broadcasting.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/06/men-underestimate-level-of-sexual-harassment-against-women-survey\">Men underestimate level of sexual harassment against women \u2013 survey</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Since I stood up to Whale during that unexpected twist of an interview last summer, I\u2019ve had to take time out from work and suffered bouts of anxiety and depression for which I\u2019ve had to seek therapy and medication. But I\u2019ve also been contacted by hundreds of people offering support, sharing similar stories of assault, and expressing concern that this is the level of public discourse we deem acceptable around it.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s because of this I felt I had to challenge the message sent out by my interview, both for listeners affected by such a sensitive but far-reaching topic (some <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingseptember2018\" title=\"\">158,162 sexual assaults</a> were recorded by the ONS between October 2017 and September 2018), and for victims, who might worry about being met with interrogation and doubt if they also choose to disclose their assault \u2013 and remain silent as a result.</p> \n<p>In their report, which is published on the Ofcom website today, Ofcom has made it clear that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/31/men-metoo-power-women-feelings\" title=\"\">#MeToo campaign</a> has been a watershed moment for how we talk about sexual assault in the media, and that any broadcaster that hinges a discussion around it, as TalkRadio did last August, must be aware of the very serious issues that discussion might raise, however it is initially framed.</p> \n<p>In their attempted defence of the breach, TalkRadio described me as \u201cmore than a match for Whale \u2026 who gave as much, if not more, than she got\u201d. But Ofcom has rejected the notion that this meant no offence was caused either to me or the listeners. That sets an important precedent for how we treat any interviewee who reveals themselves to be a victim. It doesn\u2019t matter if you manage to keep it together or how you talk about what happened to you \u2013 reveal something so serious and you should be afforded due respect.</p> \n<p>TalkRadio has tried to defend the exchange by claiming that the interview between me and Whale, which included such remarks as, \u201cYou\u2019re very patronising, do you know that?\u201d and \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you are, you\u2019re talking as a woman, aren\u2019t you?\u201d as I revealed details of my assault, was \u201carguably no more offensive to either interviewee or the audience than could be seen or heard on a lively edition of Question Time\u201d. But Ofcom, like many of those who complained about the interview last summer, disagrees.</p> \n<p>Disclosing jarring details of your sexual assault and then being forced to defend every aspect of your behaviour in the aftermath, even when you\u2019re a media professional, is hardly comparable to fighting your political corner as an MP or commentator. TalkRadio\u2019s assertion that I could have been said \u201cto have come out on top\u201d completely \u2013 and worryingly \u2013 misses the point of why I stood up for myself and the facts about sexual offences in that interview.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/03/sexual-assault-victims-newsnight-media-blaming-victims\">How do sexual assault victims feel when the media fails them like this? | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Crucially, this is not a matter of crushing free speech. It\u2019s a matter of reinforcing the importance of appropriate tone and interviewing method, something the best interviewers know to deploy when tackling deeply upsetting issues that affect a significant proportion of the population and by proxy, their audience. Rarely is a question off limits, if only you know how to ask it with due sensitivity. And when some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/08/sexual-assault-women-crime-survey-england-wales-ons-police-figures\" title=\"\">3 million women have been sexually assaulted in the UK</a>, and nearly 700,000 men, understanding the need for that sensitivity is vital.</p> \n<p>The conversations we see and hear on TV and radio have enormous power to enable people to come forward with their own stories. Let\u2019s hope this ruling from Ofcom sets the precedent for supporting victims of sexual crimes, wherever they choose to open up.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Nichi Hodgson is a sex and relationships author and broadcaster</p>",

Since I stood up to Whale during that unexpected twist of an interview last summer, I\u2019ve had to take time out from work and suffered bouts of anxiety and depression for which I\u2019ve had to seek therapy and medication. But I\u2019ve also been contacted by hundreds of people offering support, sharing similar stories of assault, and expressing concern that this is the level of public discourse we deem acceptable around it. It\u2019s because of this I felt I had to challenge the message sent out by my interview, both for listeners affected by such a sensitive but far-reaching topic (some 158,162 sexual assaults were recorded by the ONS between October 2017 and September 2018), and for victims, who might worry about being met with interrogation and doubt if they also choose to disclose their assault \u2013 and remain silent as a result. In their report, which is published on the Ofcom website today, Ofcom has made it clear that the #MeToo campaign has been a watershed moment for how we talk about sexual assault in the media, and that any broadcaster that hinges a discussion around it, as TalkRadio did last August, must be aware of the very serious issues that discussion might raise, however it is initially framed. In their attempted defence of the breach, TalkRadio described me as \u201cmore than a match for Whale \u2026 who gave as much, if not more, than she got\u201d. But Ofcom has rejected the notion that this meant no offence was caused either to me or the listeners. That sets an important precedent for how we treat any interviewee who reveals themselves to be a victim. It doesn\u2019t matter if you manage to keep it together or how you talk about what happened to you \u2013 reveal something so serious and you should be afforded due respect. TalkRadio has tried to defend the exchange by claiming that the interview between me and Whale, which included such remarks as, \u201cYou\u2019re very patronising, do you know that?\u201d and \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you are, you\u2019re talking as a woman, aren\u2019t you?\u201d as I revealed details of my assault, was \u201carguably no more offensive to either interviewee or the audience than could be seen or heard on a lively edition of Question Time\u201d. But Ofcom, like many of those who complained about the interview last summer, disagrees. Disclosing jarring details of your sexual assault and then being forced to defend every aspect of your behaviour in the aftermath, even when you\u2019re a media professional, is hardly comparable to fighting your political corner as an MP or commentator. TalkRadio\u2019s assertion that I could have been said \u201cto have come out on top\u201d completely \u2013 and worryingly \u2013 misses the point of why I stood up for myself and the facts about sexual offences in that interview. Crucially, this is not a matter of crushing free speech. It\u2019s a matter of reinforcing the importance of appropriate tone and interviewing method, something the best interviewers know to deploy when tackling deeply upsetting issues that affect a significant proportion of the population and by proxy, their audience. Rarely is a question off limits, if only you know how to ask it with due sensitivity. And when some 3 million women have been sexually assaulted in the UK, and nearly 700,000 men, understanding the need for that sensitivity is vital. The conversations we see and hear on TV and radio have enormous power to enable people to come forward with their own stories. Let\u2019s hope this ruling from Ofcom sets the precedent for supporting victims of sexual crimes, wherever they choose to open up. \u2022 Nichi Hodgson is a sex and relationships author and broadcaster",

      "bodyText": "Spain has warned that it will not back any military intervention in Venezuela after the South American country\u2019s opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, urged other nations to consider \u201call options\u201d to remove the president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, from power. Guaid\u00f3 is due to meet the US vice-president, Mike Pence, in Colombia on Monday amid ongoing speculation that the Trump administration could use force to oust Maduro. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s appeal came after a day of violence on Saturday, as opposition supporters spent hours trying to break a government blockade and carry food and medical supplies into Venezuela. At least four people were killed and more than 300 hundred injured. \u201cThe events of today oblige me to take a decision,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 said on Twitter on Sunday, \u201cto formally propose to the international community that we should keep all options open to achieve the liberation of our homeland\u201d. Pence will announce \u201cconcrete steps\u201d and \u201cclear actions\u201d at a summit of the regional Lima Group in Bogot\u00e1 on Monday, a senior US official told reporters on Sunday. \u201cWhat happened yesterday is not going to deter us from getting humanitarian aid into Venezuela,\u201d the official said. However, the Spanish government spoke out pointedly against any use of foreign force. \u201cNot every option is on the table,\u201d the country\u2019s foreign minister, Josep Borrell, told the Spanish news agency Efe on Sunday. \u201cWe have clearly warned that we would not support \u2013 and would roundly condemn \u2013 any foreign military intervention, which is something we hope won\u2019t happen.\u201d Borrell repeated calls for fresh elections in the South American country, adding: \u201cThe solution in Venezuela can only be reached through a democratic solution agreed by Venezuelans and the calling of presidential elections.\u201d Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, was among the European leaders who recognised Guaid\u00f3 at the beginning of February. S\u00e1nchez said there were deep ties that bound Spain to Latin America and promised to work to help \u201cbring freedom, prosperity and harmony to all Venezuelans\u201d. The decision to recognise Guaid\u00f3 prompted Maduro to lash out at the former colonial power and accuse S\u00e1nchez of being a coward and a US stooge. Relations between the two countries have long been fraught. In 2007, King Juan Carlos famously objected to the behaviour of the then Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, at a summit, telling him: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you shut up?\u201d. In January last year, Maduro\u2019s government expelled the Spanish ambassador to Venezuela, leading Madrid to designate the Venezuelan ambassador to Spain persona non grata. The Venezuelan president said Spain was run by an \u201celite, racist colonial oligarchy\u201d and had repeatedly meddled in his country\u2019s affairs. The two countries agreed to normalise their diplomatic relations three months later. Pence will have a one-on-one meeting in Bogot\u00e1 with Guaid\u00f3, whom the US has also recognised as the interim president of Venezuela. The 35-year-old, who transformed Venezuelan politics and united a fractured and ineffective opposition when he declared himself the country\u2019s legitimate leader in January, has repeatedly said his focus is on a peaceful transition and new elections. Guaid\u00f3 claimed on Monday morning that more than 160 soldiers and policemen had fled to Colombia, refusing to continue to follow Maduro\u2019s orders. \u201cVenezuelans recognise the bravery and patriotic spirit of the more than 160 soldiers and policemen who yesterday were on the side of the constitution,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cMany more will follow their example.\u201d But his comments on Saturday raised concerns he might be considering a military intervention and were soon picked up by US hawks including the Florida senator Marco Rubio. \u201cThe grave crimes committed today by the Maduro regime have opened the door to various potential multilateral actions not on the table just 24 hours ago,\u201d Rubio said in response to Guaid\u00f3, also on Twitter. On Sunday morning, he added: \u201cThe willingness of many nations to support stronger multilateral actions to dislodge them has increased dramatically.\u201d The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, was more circumspect, saying \u201cfurther action will be contemplated\u201d at Monday\u2019s meeting, but the focus would be on sanctions, humanitarian aid and actions by Venezuelans themselves. Donald Trump did not immediately respond to Guaid\u00f3, but he said last month \u201call options were on the table\u201d, and has suggested invading Venezuela. On Sunday, a top US official was asked whether the US would provide military assistance were Guaid\u00f3 to request it. \u201cUltimately, it would be a decision for the president to make,\u201d the official said. David Smolansky, opposition leader in exile and close friend and ally of Guaid\u00f3, insisted they were not calling for troops on the ground. \u201cIt is still a peaceful movement,\u201d he said. \u201cViolence yesterday came from armed pro-government gangs and security forces.\u201d But pressed on whether he would support military intervention in future, he declined to rule it out, saying: \u201cThe only option we have is to restore democracy and freedom with internal and external pressure.\u201d The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, deplored the weekend\u2019s killings, calling for violence to be \u201cavoided at any cost and for lethal force not to be used in any circumstances\u201d.

But her voice was distinctive from the start: cold in its exposure of false sentiment while warmly attentive to the details of family life and female experience.</p> <p>Ginzburg has long been famous in Italy as a writer, publisher (she worked alongside Pavese and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/aug/13/short-story-survey-italo-calvino\" title=\"\">Italo Calvino</a> at Einaudi after the war) and politician (in 1983 she was elected as an independent to the Italian parliament, where she gave speeches about sexual violence, disarmament and the destruction of rural life). However, she was considerably less read in Britain than the male neorealists until last year, when Daunt reissued her 1962 essay collection <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/25/the-little-virtues-by-natalia-ginzburg-review\" title=\"\">The Little Virtues</a></em> and her 1963 novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/19/family-lexicon-natalia-ginzburg-review\" title=\"\">Family Lexicon</a></em>. Now they are reissuing her 1961 novel <em>Voices in the Evening</em>.</p> <p>Reading these books, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in feeling a swift readerly intimacy. In this respect, it\u2019s a bit like reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/elena-ferrante\" title=\"\">Elena Ferrante</a>, but where reading Ferrante can seem like making a new friend, reading Ginzburg is more like finding a mentor. Here is someone who shares the experiences of daily life but also brings a fully formed moral and intellectual compass that allows you to see these experiences more objectively. From the smallest components of domestic life, she builds a world with the ethical complexity of the great 19th-century novels.</p> <p>The essays in <em>The Little Virtues</em> lead back to the second world war and its aftermath, providing an anatomy of these years, with their worn shoes, food shortages and existential depletion. In the story Winter in the Abruzzi, she evokes life in their wartime village and then abruptly describes her husband\u2019s death in prison in 1943. Did this really happen to them, she asks, \u201cwho bought oranges at Giro\u2019s and went for walks in the snow\u201d?The reckoning with war\u2019s assault on the ordinary continues in The Son of Man, written in 1946. \u201cThere has been a war and people have seen so many houses reduced to rubble that they no longer feel safe in their own homes, which once seemed so quiet and secure.\u201d</p> <p>The collection ends with two masterpieces that push out into a larger moral landscape. The first, Human Relationships leads movingly through the stages of life from childhood to adulthood. Ginzburg writes, unusually but absolutely assuredly, in the first person plural, recounting \u201cour\u201d rebellion against our parents, our search for the right friend and the right lover, moving onwards into motherhood and war. The whole of life is here, but perfectly scaled down to focus on the everyday, with its slammed doors and exercise books (best friends briefly with a popular girl, she examines her precious book with its \u201cbeautiful angular handwriting in blue ink\u201d). Along the way, she asks fundamental questions about how we can be moral beings who love our children, our friends and neighbours and at the same time serve a higher purpose (at once God and a communist vision of the collective). The shock of motherhood, then as now, is in its selfishness: \u201cWe love our children in such a painful, frightening way that it seems to us we have never had any other neighbour \u2026 Where is God now? We only remember to talk to God when our baby is ill.\u201d This is changed by war, when she learns to ask for help from passersby. For a while, she renounces possession of things and people, growing up in the process. \u201cWe are adult because we have behind us the silent presence of the dead, whom we ask to judge our current actions and from whom we ask forgiveness for past offences.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06473a47b08b045669761946998bd5998dacfabe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06473a47b08b045669761946998bd5998dacfabe/0_1162_3951_3949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Village life \u2026 Women in the Abruzzi, where Ginzburg spent the war.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Village life \u2026 Women in the Abruzzi, where Ginzburg spent the war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mondadori Portfolio/Mondadori via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The final essay, The Little Virtues, suggests what we should teach our children: \u201cI think they should be taught not the little virtues but the great ones. Not thrift but generosity and an indifference to money: not caution but courage and a contempt for danger; not shrewdness but frankness and a love of truth; not tact but love for one\u2019s neighbour and self-denial; not a desire for success but a desire to be and to know.\u201d In other hands, advice like this could be unappealingly didactic, but here it feels the result of patiently learnt experience. These values thread through <em>Family Lexicon</em>, Ginzburg\u2019s first commercial success, published when she was 47. This is the world of Ginzburg\u2019s early life in Turin, with her Jewish biologist father and her Catholic, music-loving mother, the whole family arguing about politics. The book\u2019s title refers to the phrases that characterise each person, phrases that become \u201cour Latin, the dictionary of our past\u201d, once war destroys their world.</p> <p>Along the way, Ginzburg addresses questions of literature and politics. Calvino, in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/03/biography.fiction1\" title=\"\">Hermit in Paris</a>,</em> writes that the \u201cclimate of poverty and feverish undertakings\u201d of the postwar years inspired his generation of leftists foremost with \u201ca desire for action\u201d. Ginzburg describes the excitement of the fever, \u201cwhen everyone believed himself to be a poet and a politician\u201d and was finding that \u201cmany words were in circulation and reality appeared to be at everyone\u2019s fingertips\u201d. She then shows it becoming more debilitatingly sickly: \u201cThe common error was to still believe that everything could be transformed into poetry and words. This resulted in a loathing for poetry and for words \u2026 in the end everyone kept quiet, paralysed by boredom and nausea. It was necessary for writers to go back and choose their words, scrutinise them to see if they were false or real, if they had actual origins in our experience.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was necessary for writers to go back and scrutinise their words to see if they were false or\u00a0real</p> <footer> <cite>Natalia Ginzburg</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is the quest that characterises neorealism, with its dual commitment to actual experience and to reinventing that experience in new artistic forms to make it count as real again. In compiling a family lexicon, Ginzburg finds her own way to do this: fastening on the words that have brought not just her family but the whole community into being. She is asking if she can use them to stake her claim on reality and if there can be a form of community after fascism that is authentic and free of lies. She is doing this, explicitly, as a woman. In her 1949 essay My Vocation, she described her early attempts to write like a man, using \u201cirony and nastiness\u201d, and her realisation after having children that she could only write authentically as a woman: \u201cI no longer wanted to write like a man, because I had had children and I thought I knew a great many things about tomato sauce, and even if I didn\u2019t put them into my story it helped my vocation that I knew them.\u201dThis is one of the places where I find Ginzburg so stimulating as a mentor from the past. She\u2019s offering women writers our daily experience not as domestic writing but as an ingredient in the larger project of writing about complicated times. </p> <p><em>Voices in the Evening</em>, published two years before <em>Family Lexicon</em>, is in some ways a paired book, where she\u2019s engaged in the same quest to find words that have \u201cactual origins in our experience\u201d. She had been living in England and reading Ivy Compton-Burnett when she wrote it, and Compton-Burnett\u2019s style infuses the pages of polyphonic dialogue. I find this earlier novel more satisfactory as an act of storytelling than <em>Family Lexicon</em>, where the narrator occludes her own experience. In her introduction to <em>The Little Virtues</em>, Rachel Cusk praises Ginzburg in <em>Family Lexicon</em> for separating \u201cthe concept of storytelling from the concept of self and in doing so [taking] a great stride towards a more truthful representation of reality\u201d. Cusk finds in Ginzburg\u2019s narrator a prototype for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/04/kudos-rachel-cusk-review\" title=\"\">her own recent trilogy</a>. Certainly Ginzburg is making a point about the futility of insisting on selfhood, and this is partly a political point, made by someone who remained a communist even after she broke with the party. But Ginzburg\u2019s narrator is implicated in the lives of her characters in a way that Cusk\u2019s is not, and so it can feel misleading that she holds back so much about her life. She marries and moves city, but tells us only as an afterthought.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/19/from-fellini-to-ferrante-the-cinematic-vision-my-brilliant-friend\">From Fellini to Ferrante: the cinematic vision of My Brilliant Friend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In <em>Voices in the Evening,</em> the misleadingness itself is probed for its significance. The first half of the book recounts in minute detail the histories of the father and children of the De Francisci family, owners of the factory whose acrid smell permeates the whole town. These characters, like those in <em>Family Lexicon</em>, are deftly drawn with a few telling characteristics (one son explains everything by psychoanalysis, a daughter-in-law powders her face so much that she looks dusty). Though we understand that this is a world where no one story can be told without reference to the rest of the community, we might wonder why the narrator, Elsa, is regaling us with these tales. Then, halfway through, we learn that she\u2019s had an unsatisfactory love affair with Tommasino, one of the sons.</p> <p>After this, the novel becomes more tightly focused on the quiet build up and deflation of Elsa and Tommasino\u2019s relationship. Secret, strangely precious afternoons of love-making and talking at a flat in town give way to a formal engagement that kills their love, making Tommasino feel that he has turned his back on his own soul. It\u2019s through this relationship that the boredom and nausea of the postwar world is revealed most painfully, allowing Ginzburg to portray a wasted generation and by the casual brutality that remains in the wake of war left crippled by its past.</p> <p>Near the end, Tommasino tells Elsa that he can\u2019t assert himself because he feels that \u201cthey have already lived enough, those others before me; that they have already consumed all the reserves, all the vitality that there was for us.\u201d This takes us back to the dilemmas described in Human Relationships and forwards to those in <em>Family Lexicon</em>. They are dilemmas faced also by Calvino and Pavese (whose suicide haunted Ginzburg as it haunted Calvino) and confronting us in only subtly mutated forms today. How to keep the energy and excitement of the postwar world generative rather than merely intoxicating; how to build a new world with integrity; how to live as an individual authentically within a community; how to survive the judgment of the silent dead.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In 1941 Cesare Pavese wrote a postcard to the 25-year-old Natalia Ginzburg in the Abruzzi, where she was waiting out the war with her three children: \u201cDear Natalia, stop having children and write a book that is better than mine.\u201d The result was The Road to the City, published in 1942 under a pseudonym because her husband, Leone Ginzburg (a colleague of Pavese\u2019s at the Einaudi publishing house), was in trouble for his antifascist activities. Thus began a 50-year writing career. Ginzburg was influenced by Pavese and was later happy to describe herself as a neorealist, part of a literary movement that echoed contemporary Italian cinema.

The impetus of November and December has ebbed away and although Liverpool still have the title in their own hands, there is a distinct sense that the momentum is now with Manchester City.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/24/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Liverpool fail to fire in stalemate with injury-hit Manchester United</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were specific frustrations here, given how United spent the entire first half in a blur of reorganisation, their technical area transformed into a triage station, but the truth is that, since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/29/liverpool-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">5-1 win over Arsenal </a>at the end of December, Liverpool have not played with the sort of attacking verve for which they have become renowned under J\u00fcrgen Klopp.</p> <p>There was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/09/liverpool-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">3-0 win over Bournemouth</a>, it\u2019s true, but there may not be a better opponent for a top side to play, certainly at home: the game will always be open and is very unlikely to degenerate into a battle. This was a fourth draw in their past five games for Klopp\u2019s side and only the second time they have failed to score in two successive games this season.</p> <p>There\u2019s a tendency always to want what you do not have, to believe that the blanket is always slightly too small, but there have been times this season when Liverpool\u2019s midfield has seemed distinctly functional. Nobody can realistically doubt that Liverpool did well from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/06/philippe-coutinho-join-barcelona-142m-deal-liverpool\" title=\"\">sale of Philippe Coutinho</a>, who wanted to go anyway, and whose fee helped pay for Virgil van Dijk, but equally there have been times this season when they have lacked a little of the invention he might have brought.</p> <p>That was particularly obvious, for instance, in the away games against Napoli and Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. Perhaps if Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had not been ruled out with a cruciate injury, he could have provided a little thrust, but the fact is that a team that set up with Henderson, Fabinho and Georginio Wijnaldum as their midfield three will always risk being a little lacking in guile.</p> <p>Which raises the question of how Liverpool last season, even after Oxlade-Chamberlain had suffered his knee injury, never seemed so flat as this. The answer perhaps lies in pressing, which Klopp once declared the greatest playmaker in the world. Play high up the pitch, keep the opponent under constant pressure and mistakes will be made and chances will come. It was a theory that had worked for Klopp at Mainz and at Borussia Dortmund and was doing so at Liverpool as well.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/24/arsenal-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">Arsenal boosted as Henrikh Mkhitaryan secures win against Southampton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The problem was that it came at a cost. Liverpool finished last season in a state of exhaustion, their squad stretched to the absolute maximum. It didn\u2019t take Raymond Verheijen to diagnose the problem \u2013 although the Dutch coach did, repeatedly, on social media. Liverpool were running too hard. So Klopp took the logical step of easing back. Liverpool have, by and large, not pressed with anything like the same intensity this season. The result has been fewer injuries and an improved defence, but the change of approach has also highlighted the lack of midfield flair since the departure of Coutinho.</p> <p>None of which would necessarily matter were the front three firing as they did in those final months of last season. But they are not.</p> <p>Roberto Firmino has been struggling with a virus recently and left Old Trafford on crutches after sustaining an ankle injury. Mohamed Salah has seemed oddly out of sorts in recent weeks, at times bafflingly so, like Billy in one of those frequent periods in which his magic boots had gone missing. Man\u00e9, with four goals in successive games before the draw against Bayern, has been left to carry the burden, but given how deep United played, there was never likely to be space behind the defensive line that he could attack with his pace.</p> <p>But to speak of individuals, perhaps, is to miss the point. The interaction between the front three is not what it was. There is not the same sense of a telepathic understanding. In part that\u2019s to do with opponents sitting deep so the opportunities for those thrilling sweeping counters are diminished, but only in part. A tentativeness has crept into Liverpool\u2019s attacking play that has ramifications across the pitch.</p> <p>If the movement is not so slick as it should be, there are fewer targets for Henderson to hit, which perhaps explains why so often he resorted to hitting it long. Klopp spent most of the game in a fury, and Henderson pointedly snubbed him after being substituted, suggesting that he felt a disproportionate amount of the criticism had been directed at him or that he was frustrated at being the player to make way for Xherdan Shaqiri.</p> <p>The Switzerland international can bring a spark, as he did in turning United\u2019s game at Anfield this season Liverpool\u2019s way, but by the end the visitors ended up with Daniel Sturridge and Divock Origi up front, trying to pick them out with aerial balls.</p> <p>A draw at Old Trafford can never be a poor result and if City lose here it will look a very good one. But the bigger issue for Liverpool is perhaps more the performance and the general lack of penetration.</p>",

There were specific frustrations here, given how United spent the entire first half in a blur of reorganisation, their technical area transformed into a triage station, but the truth is that, since the 5-1 win over Arsenal at the end of December, Liverpool have not played with the sort of attacking verve for which they have become renowned under J\u00fcrgen Klopp. There was the 3-0 win over Bournemouth, it\u2019s true, but there may not be a better opponent for a top side to play, certainly at home: the game will always be open and is very unlikely to degenerate into a battle. This was a fourth draw in their past five games for Klopp\u2019s side and only the second time they have failed to score in two successive games this season. There\u2019s a tendency always to want what you do not have, to believe that the blanket is always slightly too small, but there have been times this season when Liverpool\u2019s midfield has seemed distinctly functional. Nobody can realistically doubt that Liverpool did well from the sale of Philippe Coutinho, who wanted to go anyway, and whose fee helped pay for Virgil van Dijk, but equally there have been times this season when they have lacked a little of the invention he might have brought. That was particularly obvious, for instance, in the away games against Napoli and Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. Perhaps if Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had not been ruled out with a cruciate injury, he could have provided a little thrust, but the fact is that a team that set up with Henderson, Fabinho and Georginio Wijnaldum as their midfield three will always risk being a little lacking in guile. Which raises the question of how Liverpool last season, even after Oxlade-Chamberlain had suffered his knee injury, never seemed so flat as this. The answer perhaps lies in pressing, which Klopp once declared the greatest playmaker in the world. Play high up the pitch, keep the opponent under constant pressure and mistakes will be made and chances will come. It was a theory that had worked for Klopp at Mainz and at Borussia Dortmund and was doing so at Liverpool as well. The problem was that it came at a cost. Liverpool finished last season in a state of exhaustion, their squad stretched to the absolute maximum. It didn\u2019t take Raymond Verheijen to diagnose the problem \u2013 although the Dutch coach did, repeatedly, on social media. Liverpool were running too hard. So Klopp took the logical step of easing back. Liverpool have, by and large, not pressed with anything like the same intensity this season. The result has been fewer injuries and an improved defence, but the change of approach has also highlighted the lack of midfield flair since the departure of Coutinho. None of which would necessarily matter were the front three firing as they did in those final months of last season. But they are not. Roberto Firmino has been struggling with a virus recently and left Old Trafford on crutches after sustaining an ankle injury. Mohamed Salah has seemed oddly out of sorts in recent weeks, at times bafflingly so, like Billy in one of those frequent periods in which his magic boots had gone missing. Man\u00e9, with four goals in successive games before the draw against Bayern, has been left to carry the burden, but given how deep United played, there was never likely to be space behind the defensive line that he could attack with his pace. But to speak of individuals, perhaps, is to miss the point. The interaction between the front three is not what it was. There is not the same sense of a telepathic understanding. In part that\u2019s to do with opponents sitting deep so the opportunities for those thrilling sweeping counters are diminished, but only in part. A tentativeness has crept into Liverpool\u2019s attacking play that has ramifications across the pitch. If the movement is not so slick as it should be, there are fewer targets for Henderson to hit, which perhaps explains why so often he resorted to hitting it long. Klopp spent most of the game in a fury, and Henderson pointedly snubbed him after being substituted, suggesting that he felt a disproportionate amount of the criticism had been directed at him or that he was frustrated at being the player to make way for Xherdan Shaqiri. The Switzerland international can bring a spark, as he did in turning United\u2019s game at Anfield this season Liverpool\u2019s way, but by the end the visitors ended up with Daniel Sturridge and Divock Origi up front, trying to pick them out with aerial balls. A draw at Old Trafford can never be a poor result and if City lose here it will look a very good one. But the bigger issue for Liverpool is perhaps more the performance and the general lack of penetration.",

Two years ago, after England\u2019s narrow win in Cardiff, Jones was trumpeting England\u2019s smart use of tactical periodisation, having travelled to Qatar to meet a sports scientist with close links to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho.

      "bodyText": "Some rugby days are hard to beat. Saturday was one of them, particularly for those with Welsh blood pulsing through their veins. In terms of gladiatorial combat, passion, fellowship and emotion, it is hard to imagine a more vivid piece of Six Nations theatre. The Welsh Rugby Union\u2019s pre-match entertainment would impress even PT Barnum nowadays. By most available measures, Wales also now have a team capable of rising as surely to huge occasions as any. At this rate Warren Gatland\u2019s grand slam-chasing squad may yet head into the autumn World Cup as the European team to beat, having already racked up 12 successive Test wins and leapfrogged England into third place in the world rankings. The green, green grass of home has seldom appeared as lush in the professional era. Once the hangovers have finally worn off \u2013 the streets of Cardiff were awash with rather more than joy \u2013 both sides will also reflect on a contest which revealed a significant amount about their respective mental strengths and weaknesses. Not for nothing did Gatland suggest afterwards that England, for all their physicality and recent progress, still have a propensity for \u201cchoking\u201d. At times this felt like Cardiff 2013 and Twickenham 2015 all over again, with dull thinking and an inability to locate another tactical gear costing England up the final straight. With one eye on the Japanese horizon, Gatland knew exactly what he was doing when he observed that England remain vulnerable under screeching pressure. \u201cI look back on England in the last few years and when it\u2019s really mattered I\u2019ve questioned whether they can win these really big games,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a record of being pretty good in them.\u201d Given Wales have advanced further than England at each of the past two World Cups, it is hard to dispute his opinion. As Wales ready themselves for the challenge of defeating Scotland and Ireland in successive weekends to claim a first slam since 2012, it is clearly an issue which cannot be ignored by Eddie Jones and his lieutenants. Two years ago, after England\u2019s narrow win in Cardiff, Jones was trumpeting England\u2019s smart use of tactical periodisation, having travelled to Qatar to meet a sports scientist with close links to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. In 14 of Jones\u2019s first 15 Tests, England won the second half; now, suddenly, it is England who are being caught at the death. On this occasion they lost the second half 18-3 and the final 15 minutes were a horror show. At 13-9 ahead and in possession in Wales\u2019s half they were in control of their own destiny until Owen Farrell, standing at acting scrum-half, slung out a bullet pass which Mark Wilson was unable to hold. From the turnover Wales regained crucial momentum and, after 34 relentless phases, the unstoppable Cory Hill gave Wales the lead. Despite Dan Biggar\u2019s fine conversion the visitors still theoretically had a chance only for Wales\u2019s aerial excellence, combined with England\u2019s stubborn refusal to vary their original box-kicking game, to give Gatland the last laugh. Blaming Kyle Sinckler for a couple of cheap penalties conveniently ignores Welsh excellence and English deficiencies in other respects. Not only was the host side\u2019s discipline better \u2013 three penalties conceded \u2013 but their bench made much more of an impact. Quite why Jones chose not to use three of his \u201cfinishers\u201d and kept on some understandably footsore forwards until the game was gone was a mystery. The freshness of body and mind evident in Dublin was only rarely in evidence. Last year England trailed in fifth having been overtrained in midweek; there were hints of it again here. In contrast, Gatland felt his side\u2019s preparation, having rotated his team in Italy, had been among the best in his time with Wales.

      "bodyText": "Labour has a much larger number of members who hold \u201chardcore antisemitic opinions\u201d than previously thought, Momentum\u2019s founder has said. Jon Lansman, who is chair of Momentum and also a member of Labour\u2019s national executive committee (NEC), said antisemitism was a widespread problem in the party and that he felt \u201cregret, sadness and some shame\u201d at the decision of the Jewish MP Luciana Berger to quit the party last week. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the party was not institutionally antisemitic, and instead attributed the problem to \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d who had joined the party since 2015. \u201cThe party trebled in size,\u201d said Lansman, who is Jewish. \u201cAmongst those are members attracted towards conspiracy theories.\u201d He added: \u201cThe Tory party is a smaller party and an elderly party and the role of social media in fomenting and spreading some of the poison is therefore more of a problem in the Labour party.\u201d Facebook groups in particular can become arenas in which a minority with hardcore views can become amplified, Lansman said. He also defended the Labour leader, saying \u201cJeremy Corbyn has been an anti-racist all his life and I absolutely believe his commitment to that.\u201d Lansman\u2019s intervention came after the party\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, said on Sunday there was \u201ca crisis for the soul of the Labour party\u201d and disclosed he had forwarded 50 complaints about antisemitism to Corbyn. Lansman said the NEC was looking at more cases of antisemitism. When pressed as to whether Corbyn could provide stronger leadership to combat antisemitism, as Watson had urged, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure about him taking personal responsibility for cases. I think if he did that, some people might argue that that would be inappropriate.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t want any Jewish member in the party to be leaving. We are absolutely committed to making Labour a safe space.\u201d On Twitter, Lansman later added: \u201cJust last Friday we referred 19 out of 35 cases reviews to the NCC almost all with a strong recommendation for expulsion. Of Labour\u2019s 500,000 members perhaps a few hundred are hardcore antisemites. If we improve our processes, we can make sure they are kicked out of the party.\u201d Lansman, asked about the wider problems that Labour was facing, said he believed the party would hold together in the face of resignations over issues including antisemitism, Corbyn and Brexit. He said a proposal by Watson that a new internal grouping for MPs from the social democrat tradition who are not represented in the shadow cabinet should be considered. \u201cI welcome members with a common view,\u201d Lansman said. \u201cWe\u2019re a pluralist party.\u201d On Sunday, a Labour spokesperson said the party \u201ctakes all complaints of antisemitism seriously\u201d and that \u201call complaints about antisemitism are investigated in line with our rules and procedures\u201d.",

Little by little, she has started to form words again. \u201cThe village is the best rehabilitation for the things these families have suffered,\u201d Nujin says.</p> \n<p>Jinwar is not finished yet: there are gardens to plant and an empty library waiting for books.

      "bodyText": "Berivan runs over to join in the dancing, her traditional gold dress catching the winter sunlight. The 15-year-old Yazidi clasps hands with her best friend and stands among the line of women stamping their feet to a Kurdish pop song. Berivan and her mother are from Sinjar in Iraq, the Yazidi homeland, but like thousands of other Yazidis they were kidnapped by Islamic State in 2014 when the group stormed across the border from Syria. Far from here, in the eastern desert, Isis has almost lost control of its last stronghold, Baghuz, but there are at least 3,000 Yazidi women and girls whose fate is unknown. During the genocide, Yazidi men were rounded up and shot then dumped in mass graves. The women were taken to be sold in Isis\u2019s slave markets, many passed from fighter to fighter, who inflicted physical and sexual abuse. Yazidi children have been brainwashed and rights groups say suicide among captives is common. Even for those who manage to escape after years of enslavement and rape, many struggle to survive without an income or identity papers. Berivan and her mother have lost the other members of their family. But at a new women\u2019s commune near Qamishli, in north-eastern Syria, they have had a chance to start over. \u201cI like it here,\u201d she says. \u201cI love going to school, I love mathematics. And I\u2019m going to be a hairdresser when I grow up.\u201d Jinwar is a female-only community, set up by the women of the local Kurdish-run administration to create a space where women can live \u201cfree of the constraints of the oppressive power structures of patriarchy and capitalism\u201d. It opened in November and 12 of its 30 adobe brick houses are home to Kurdish, Yazidi and Arab families. The women built their own houses, bake their own bread and tend to the livestock and farmland, cooking and eating together. On Saturday, people from the neighbouring villages have been invited to a graduation celebration for a group of local women who had attended a course on natural medicines at Jinwar\u2019s education centre. Over chicken and rice, and later music and dancing, residents discuss how the newly planted apricot, pomegranate and olive trees are doing. \u201cWe built this place ourselves, brick by brick,\u201d says 35-year-old Barwa Darwish, who came to Jinwar with her seven children after her village in Deir Ezzor province was freed from Isis and her husband, who joined the fight against the group, was killed in action. \u201cUnder Isis we were strangled and now we are free. But even before that, women stayed at home. We didn\u2019t go out and work. In Jinwar, I\u2019ve seen that women can stand alone.\u201d Jinwar grew out of the democratic ideology that has fuelled the creation of Rojava, a Kurdish-run statelet in north-eastern Syria, since the civil war broke out in 2011. The area has largely thrived despite the presence of enemies on all sides: Isis, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad\u2019s troops, and Turkey, which regards the Kurdish YPG fighters as a terrorist organisation. The women\u2019s revolution, as it is known, is a significant part of Rojava\u2019s philosophy. Angered by the atrocities committed by Isis, Kurdish women formed their own fighting units. Later, Arab and Yazidi recruits joined them on the front lines to liberate their sisters. But at home, many parts of Kurdish society are still deeply conservative. Some of the women now in Jinwar have left arranged marriages and domestic abuse. Those dynamics, as well as the legacy of Syria\u2019s brutal eight-year war have to be unlearned at Jinwar. \u201cWhen the families first arrived, the Arab children wouldn\u2019t play with the Kurdish children,\u201d says Nujin, one of the international volunteers working at the village. \u201cBut even in just two months you can see the change. The children are already so much happier.\u201d Berivan\u2019s mother, Darsim, was mute when she arrived at Jinwar, a side-effect of trauma. Little by little, she has started to form words again. \u201cThe village is the best rehabilitation for the things these families have suffered,\u201d Nujin says. Jinwar is not finished yet: there are gardens to plant and an empty library waiting for books. The community is still coming up with ideas. Behind the education centre there is a swimming pool that will be filled with water in the summer. Most of the residents will get to use a pool \u2013 the reserve of only men in most of the Middle East \u2013 for the first time. The women have also voted for driving lessons and to start a sewing business. There are plans for a second commune in Deir Ezzor, an Arab province that is still the scene of fierce fighting to destroy Isis \u2013 but there is also a sense that what has been built at Jinwar is fragile and could be taken away. It is not clear what will happen when US troops leave the area in a few months. Renewed fighting is a possibility. \u201cThis place is peaceful and a refuge from the war,\u201d Nujin says. \u201cSo how can we bring guns here if we needed to defend ourselves? I hope Jinwar never has to face that.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

Measured at just under 5ft 10in by his college, Oklahoma, Murray will be the shortest quarterback in the NFL if, and when, a team signs him.

The accepted logic is that quarterbacks need to be tall to see over the offensive line and to avoid having passes batted down by the defense.

      "bodyText": "Kyler Murray is more than just a small guy playing a big man\u2019s game. Unfortunately for Murray, an exceptional talent who is likely to be the first player ever drafted in the first round in both the MLB and NFL, the conversation has, and will continue to be, all about his size. Measured at just under 5ft 10in by his college, Oklahoma, Murray will be the shortest quarterback in the NFL if, and when, a team signs him. It\u2019s a height that got this year\u2019s Super Bowl MVP Julian Edelman, a 5ft 10in quarterback out of Kent State, converted to wide receiver. A quarterback\u2019s height is a big deal because, well, it\u2019s a big deal. Though sports are in an era increasingly dominated by performance analytics, there isn\u2019t a single shred of evidence that says a shorter quarterback can\u2019t succeed. And short quarterbacks have succeeded in the NFL: Russell Wilson (5ft 11in) and Drew Brees (6ft) have both won Super Bowls. Despite this general lack of support, the only QB shorter than 6ft 1in to be drafted in the first round of the last 15 NFL drafts was Johnny Manziel (5ft 11in) in 2014. The accepted logic is that quarterbacks need to be tall to see over the offensive line and to avoid having passes batted down by the defense. But consider this, according to Pro Football Focus, Murray had just five passes batted down last season in college football, tied for the fewest among the four quarterbacks in the top 50 prospects. The other three are 6ft 3in or taller. Murray also played Heisman Trophy-winning football behind one of the tallest offensive lines in college football (the shortest regular starter was 6ft 4in), a group likely as tall as any in the NFL.

It was pioneered in France in the mid-19th century, but was popularised by California-based engineer Ernest Ransome, who poured over iron (and later steel) bars to improving its tensile strength.</p> \n<p>Ransome\u2019s first rebar concrete building was the <a href=\"https://calisphere.org/item/bfa5fb0324c0eb3dd91093379b75931f/\">Arctic Oil Company Works warehouse</a> in San Francisco, which was completed in 1884. Five years later Ransome built the <a href=\"https://www.asce.org/project/alvord-lake-bridge/\">Alvord Lake Bridge</a> in Golden Gate Park \u2013 the world\u2019s first reinforced concrete bridge. The warehouse was demolished in 1930 but the bridge remains the world\u2019s oldest surviving reinforced concrete structure.</p> \n<p>Ransome himself was not involved in the construction of the world\u2019s first concrete skyscraper, the 16-storey Ingalls Building in Cincinnati in 1903, but it would not have been possible without his rebar (reinforcing bar) method.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"44dbb3be02c7fac2e19af2d68482155275afa614\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44dbb3be02c7fac2e19af2d68482155275afa614/0_5_2392_2990/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ingalls Building in Cincinnati, under construction in 1903.

Concrete lasts well compared with asphalt roads, which are made using bitumen, and it was widely used throughout the US interstate highway system. The original 1891 Bellefontaine concrete street is still there today.</p> \n<p>In late summer 1906, not long after the devastating San Francisco earthquake, Thomas Edison announced his proposal to mass-produce concrete houses which would be resistant to fire and tremors, and immune to termites, mildew and rot. Houses had been custom-built from reinforced concrete <a href=\"https://www.asce.org/project/ward-house/\">for several decades</a> but they were expensive. Edison\u2019s plan for construction on an industrial scale would drive down prices. Residents would be able to sit on Edison-designed cast-concrete furniture, keep food fresh in his concrete fridge and be entertained by his concrete phonograph cabinet.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ea6bfe815a269eb0825488dec51f416734f16d52\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea6bfe815a269eb0825488dec51f416734f16d52/0_108_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Edison stands by a model of his prototypical all-concrete house in 1910.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Edison stands by a model of his prototype all-concrete house in 1910.

      "bodyText": "\u201cUnlike the Pantheon \u2026 virtually all the concrete structures one sees today will eventually need to be replaced,\u201d writes Robert Courland is his weighty tome Concrete Planet, \u201ccosting us trillions of dollars in the process.\u201d While there is some debate over when and where the first concrete was used \u2013 the G\u00f6bekli Tepe temple in modern-day Turkey was built using T-shaped pillars of carved limestone approximately 12,000 years ago, desert traders used early concrete to make underground water cisterns 8,000 years ago, and the ancient Egyptians used gypsum and lime to make mortars \u2013 there is little dispute that the first people to use concrete in the way we do today were the Romans. The Romans used it in everything from bath houses to harbours, aqueducts to the Colosseum, systematising its production and application from the third century BC to the fall of the empire in the fifth century AD. Unlike modern reinforced concrete \u2013 which can last about a hundred years without major repairs or replacement \u2013 many Roman concrete structures are still with us many centuries later. The G\u00f6bekli Tepe temple (left) and the step pyramid of Djoser, Egypt. Photographs: Getty Images/Mohamed El-Shahed/AFP The key to its longevity appears to be the use of volcanic ash, or pozzolana. Where modern concrete is a mix of lime-based cement, water, sand and an aggregate such as gravel, the recipe for concrete set down by architect Vitruvius in the first century BC involved pozzolana and chunks of volcanic rock, known as tuff. When it comes to Roman marine concrete, used to construct piers and breakwaters, research published in 2017 found that the addition of sea water actually strengthened these structures over time, making them harder and harder over the millennia. The most striking surviving example of Roman concrete is the Pantheon, which the painter Michelangelo described as an \u201cangelic and not human design\u201d. It still looks strikingly modern today and it remains the largest non-reinforced concrete dome in the world, 19 centuries after it was built. Sunlight illuminates a detail of the Pantheon\u2019s concrete dome. Photograph: AndySmyTravel/Alamy Rediscovered after 1,400 years With only a couple of isolated exceptions, around 1,400 years passed after the fall of the western Roman empire until concrete was used again on any great scale. The invention of reinforced concrete gave the material a new life. It was pioneered in France in the mid-19th century, but was popularised by California-based engineer Ernest Ransome, who poured over iron (and later steel) bars to improving its tensile strength. Ransome\u2019s first rebar concrete building was the Arctic Oil Company Works warehouse in San Francisco, which was completed in 1884. Five years later Ransome built the Alvord Lake Bridge in Golden Gate Park \u2013 the world\u2019s first reinforced concrete bridge. The warehouse was demolished in 1930 but the bridge remains the world\u2019s oldest surviving reinforced concrete structure. Ransome himself was not involved in the construction of the world\u2019s first concrete skyscraper, the 16-storey Ingalls Building in Cincinnati in 1903, but it would not have been possible without his rebar (reinforcing bar) method. The first reinforced concrete skyscraper, the 1903 Ingalls Building in Cincinnati; underneath the first reinforced concrete bridge, Golden Gate Park, San Francisco. Photographs: Cincinnati Museum Center/Getty Images Meanwhile, American inventor George Bartholomew had constructed the world\u2019s first concrete street in Bellefontaine, Ohio. Concrete lasts well compared with asphalt roads, which are made using bitumen, and it was widely used throughout the US interstate highway system. The original 1891 Bellefontaine concrete street is still there today. In late summer 1906, not long after the devastating San Francisco earthquake, Thomas Edison announced his proposal to mass-produce concrete houses which would be resistant to fire and tremors, and immune to termites, mildew and rot. Houses had been custom-built from reinforced concrete for several decades but they were expensive. Edison\u2019s plan for construction on an industrial scale would drive down prices. Residents would be able to sit on Edison-designed cast-concrete furniture, keep food fresh in his concrete fridge and be entertained by his concrete phonograph cabinet. Thomas Edison stands by a model of his prototype all-concrete house in 1910. It proved too complicated to build, and he was forced to settle for a simpler design. Photograph: National Building Museum/AP \u201cI am going to live to see the day when a working man\u2019s house can be built of concrete in a week,\u201d said Edison. \u201cIf I succeed, it will take from the city slums everybody who is worth taking.\u201d To that end, the inventor announced he would give away his patented technology to anyone who promised to reserve the majority of new homes for working class residents and make no more than 10% profit \u2013 but it took another decade before the first were built. A few concrete house projects were launched across the US \u2013 including what became known as Cement City in Donora, south of Pittsburgh \u2013 but the dream of cheap, roomy concrete houses never really took off. It took architect Frank Lloyd Wright to realise the potential of reinforced concrete to create completely new forms. His first concrete building \u2013 the 1908 Unity Temple in Oak Park, Illinois \u2013 is widely considered the world\u2019s first modern building. He used the material in many of his designs, including perhaps his most famous work \u2013 Fallingwater in Mill Run, Pennsylvania \u2013 whose hanging cantilevers project out over the stream\u2019s small waterfall in a way which would have been impossible without the tensile strength of reinforced concrete. Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Fallingwater house in Mill Run, Pennsylvania, was completed in 1939.

The reality was very different. For five years she was forced into prostitution in various Italian cities.</p> <p>She prefers not to speak about that time. The psychologists caring for her at a migrant welcome centre are aware of her ordeal and are providing counselling.</p> <p>Last year, Princess sought help from an aid organisation when she found out she was pregnant. In October, she was transferred to the welcome centre in Castelnuovo di Porto, outside Rome. \u201cI was happy,\u201d she tells the Guardian. \u201cI finally believed that I had found some stability. I thought I would have given birth to my child in that centre and that we would have been able to stay there, safe.\u201d</p> <p>But one month later, before formal passage of the Salvini decree, the bill was retroactively applied by the interior ministry. As a result, hundreds of migrants were evicted from welcome centres around the country. The evictions are not only affecting those whose request for protection on humanitarian grounds is pending approval, but also those in possession of permits to stay, despite the law stipulating that their status should be maintained.</p> <p>The first reception centre to be evacuated was in Isola di Capo Rizzuto in Calabria.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the police came to tell us that we couldn\u2019t stay there any more, I couldn\u2019t believe my ears,\u201d says 31-year-old Blessing, who had been trafficked from Nigeria. \u201cThey took all of our belongings and escorted us out.

      "bodyText": "Princess stares out of the window of a welcome centre an hour outside Rome, watching the sky turn red. She clutches her three-month-old child tightly. The baby is all she has left after Nigeria stole her freedom, and Italy her hope. Princess, 31, born among the muddy streets and shacks of Benin City, left everything to come to Italy in 2008. Now she is one of the thousands of women trafficked into the country who could soon find themselves on the streets, or deported back to Nigeria, under a decree that cements the populist government\u2019s hardline immigration stance. According to the Ministry of the Interior, approximately 40,000 Nigerian women live in Italy. Many, like Princess, have been trafficked into sex work. Most possess, or have requested, humanitarian protection. But this protection is now at risk. According to the Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI) thinktank, in the past four months Italy has rejected more than 1,000 asylum applications submitted by Nigerian women, while an estimated 1,134 have been refused humanitarian protection. The main element of the Salvini decree, named after the interior minister and leader of the far-right League, Matteo Salvini, is the abolition of humanitarian protection for those who are not eligible for refugee status, but cannot be deported. After her parents died and she needed to support herself, Princess was told by traffickers that she would \u201cfind dignified work once in Italy\u201d. The reality was very different. For five years she was forced into prostitution in various Italian cities. She prefers not to speak about that time. The psychologists caring for her at a migrant welcome centre are aware of her ordeal and are providing counselling. Last year, Princess sought help from an aid organisation when she found out she was pregnant. In October, she was transferred to the welcome centre in Castelnuovo di Porto, outside Rome. \u201cI was happy,\u201d she tells the Guardian. \u201cI finally believed that I had found some stability. I thought I would have given birth to my child in that centre and that we would have been able to stay there, safe.\u201d But one month later, before formal passage of the Salvini decree, the bill was retroactively applied by the interior ministry. As a result, hundreds of migrants were evicted from welcome centres around the country. The evictions are not only affecting those whose request for protection on humanitarian grounds is pending approval, but also those in possession of permits to stay, despite the law stipulating that their status should be maintained. The first reception centre to be evacuated was in Isola di Capo Rizzuto in Calabria. \u201cWhen the police came to tell us that we couldn\u2019t stay there any more, I couldn\u2019t believe my ears,\u201d says 31-year-old Blessing, who had been trafficked from Nigeria. \u201cThey took all of our belongings and escorted us out. This is outrageous. Soon I may not have a roof over my head. I\u2019m really frightened.\u201d The state police came for Princess on 23 January. She and 500 others were evicted from the refugee reception centre in Castelnuovo di Porto. \u201cI was hoping to finally find some peace,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd once again they asked me to move.\u201d Some women, like Princess, were transferred to a welcome centre managed by the Catholic church in Rocca di Papa, or to centres managed by the aid group Caritas. Dozens of others have been evicted, their whereabouts unknown. The decree is supposed to grant victims of sex trafficking a form of protection because of the risks they may face if deported back to their countries of origin. But in order to secure protection, they must report their captor to the police or enter a rehabilitation programme. \u201cThe majority of victims of trafficking are afraid of rebelling or of entering into psychological rehabilitation,\u201d says Isoke Aikpitanyi, a trafficking survivor and founder of the anti-trafficking association Women of Benin City. \u201cUntil then, they are simply Nigerian women with a humanitarian permit that the authorities will not recognise. They have always been left alone in the world, and now more than ever.\u201d Before they leave their homes, Nigerian women are made to undergo traditional oath-taking ceremonies involving complicated and frightening rituals. The widespread use of \u201cjuju\u201d ceremonies in trafficking women from Nigeria to Europe leaves deep emotional scars. Faith, 35, was forced into prostitution for six years on the outskirts of Milan. Wanted by the police, her abuser, or madam, fled to Nigeria. Today Faith lives in a welcome centre run by the church in Rocca di Papa, outside Rome. In a few months, a commission will decide whether to accept or deny her asylum request. She is undergoing psychological treatment, and the thought of returning to Nigeria makes her cry. \u201cThey forced me into prostitution for six years and now they could send me back to Nigeria where my madam is waiting for me, the woman who ruined my life.\u201d Father Enzo Volpe, a Salesian priest in Palermo, who has been providing assistance to Nigerian women for seven years, says clearing reception centres is likely to increase the risk of further trafficking and exploitation. \u201cLeaving these girls on the street, victims of sex trafficking, is not only inhumane, it also means facilitating the work of criminal organisations,\u201d he says. \u201cWith no protection, these girls risk becoming easy prey.\u201d Names have been changed to protect identities",

Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201c[When] they take Mohamed Salah off you know Luke Shaw has played a good game.\u201d The left-back was a blur of defensive obstinacy. Solskj\u00e6r said Salah\u2019s threat meant Shaw could not attack as much as desired and this is understandable given the forward\u2019s quality. But the prevailing caveat regarding Shaw\u2019s contribution in most games is that he does not create enough when roving forward.

With former manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, working as a TV pundit, unhelpfully reminding viewers of the broadcaster DAZN Spain that Hazard has \u201cthe talent and personality to wear the Real Madrid shirt\u201d, Chelsea\u2019s star may not be around beyond the short term. If Sunday was his final Wembley appearance for Chelsea, he graced the occasion; his Panenka shootout penalty was an impudent beauty. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/24/chelsea-manchester-city-carabao-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Manchester City 0-0 Chelsea (City won 4-3 on pens)</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dc854b1a-10dc-499a-a8e0-9af12d09dc63\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gRct77aJ4Co?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/24/kepa-chelsea-sarri-carabao-cup-final-manchester-city\">Kepa\u2019s shootout mutiny emblematic of Sarri\u2019s sinking ship at Chelsea | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>3) Ranieri confounds over Sessegnon</h2> \n<p>At half-time, Claudio Ranieri removed Ryan Sessegnon and Jean Micha\u00ebl Seri: the latter because he might have otherwise been sent off, the former because the manager remains unconvinced by one of the brightest young talents in the country. Many things have gone wrong for Fulham this season, some of them out of their control, but the treatment of Sessegnon is increasingly curious. At 18 Sessegnon is not the answer to all their problems, but the issue is that he is not even being given the chance. Having set up their goal against West Ham with a forceful low cross and generally been their most threatening player, to take him off at the interval was baffling. It was hardly a surprise that, despite having the better of the second half, they could not create any clear chances, much less score a goal. <strong>Nick Miller</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/22/west-ham-fulham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">West Ham 3-1 Fulham</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22acd3a98fafb51750590b3c8e9c4bc2e4584180\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22acd3a98fafb51750590b3c8e9c4bc2e4584180/0_143_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Sessegnon reacts during Fulham\u2019s 3-1 defeat to West Ham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ryan Sessegnon reacts during Fulham\u2019s 3-1 defeat to West Ham.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images via Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>4) Nuno on hi-tech \u2013 and low cunning</h2> \n<p>On the face of it, Wolves\u2019 1-1 draw at Bournemouth was a perfect advert for VAR. There were three dubious penalties and another that might have been given to Wolves for handball by Chris Mepham. But of the four, only Ivan Cavaliero\u2019s foul on Ryan Fraser \u2013 which was outside the area, and might not have been a foul anyway \u2013 was close to the \u201cclear and obvious error\u201d that is theoretically required for a decision to be overturned. The rest were all subjective. Though VAR in the Premier League will increase the number of correct decisions, it will also heighten the sense of injustice at the debatable ones. Once technology is used, players have a much greater entitlement to the correct decision \u2013 or, rather, the decision they perceive to be correct. The issue was summed up by the Wolves head coach, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, when he was asked whether the reaction of his players to certain decisions showed they were hard done by. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot always trust the reaction of the players \u2013 sometimes they cheat.\u201d The biggest problem with technology will always be humans. <strong>Rob Smyth</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/23/bournemouth-wolves-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Bournemouth 1-1 Wolves</a></em></p> \n<h2>5) Manchester City women go Continental</h2> \n<p>Manchester City, having fallen apart this time last year from a similarly unbeaten starting point, have found the answer to staying competitive across the board and their blueprint may well be one Arsenal will pore over come the summer even if the Gunners stumble first across the finish line in the league. Arsenal have been bullish in their assertion that the league, and Champions League, have been their priority. Yet City have shown this season that compromising one trophy for another does not have to be a given. \u201cWe knew that we wanted to still be in the FA Cup, we\u2019ve done that; we wanted to stay top of the league, we\u2019ve done that; and to come here and win the third game of the week shows what a great squad we have, the great staff we have behind us and all the great work people don\u2019t see,\u201d said City\u2019s captain, Steph Houghton. <strong>Suzanne Wrack</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"http://https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/feb/23/arsenal-v-manchester-city-continental-cup-final-live\" title=\"\">Manchester City 0-0 Arsenal (City won 4-2 on pens)</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"234a030ab46d6c2fab09eccc28b39af77040caee\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/234a030ab46d6c2fab09eccc28b39af77040caee/72_432_4593_2756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester City celebrate beating Arsenal in the Continental League Cup final penalty shootout\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester City celebrate beating Arsenal in the Continental League Cup final penalty shootout</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chloe Knott/Man City via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>6) Reversal puts Hasenh\u00fcttl in a fix</h2> \n<p>When Southampton ended Arsenal\u2019s 22-match unbeaten run on 16 December at St Mary\u2019s \u2013 in Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s second game in charge \u2013 it was a performance and occasion that teemed with intensity; a clear example of a new-manager bounce. At the Emirates on Sunday, the most striking aspect of the club\u2019s 2-0 defeat was their flatness and fragility. Hasenh\u00fcttl had enjoyed two clear weeks to prepare for it after the home loss to Cardiff but his team conceded the goals early on and fell apart. They could have leaked four or five by half-time. Individual errors remain a massive problem and can Hasenh\u00fcttl legislate for those? But the broader picture is two points from an available 12 and a group of players that look inhibited. Hasenh\u00fcttl appeared to have the weight of the world on his shoulders afterwards. He has to find a way to unlock the tension. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/24/arsenal-southampton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Arsenal 2-1 Southampton</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/24/arsenal-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">Arsenal boosted as Henrikh Mkhitaryan secures win against Southampton</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>7) Turf Moor\u2019s elephant in the corner</h2> \n<p>The presence of VAR was also felt at Turf Moor \u2013 though there is no truth in the rumour that it would have sorted out the confusion over the award of the corner that led to Burnley\u2019s first goal against Tottenham. VAR is not going to be wheeled out next season for every toss-of-a-coin line decision in the course of a game and in any case, given that there was still room for debate even after several slow-motion replays of Jan Vertonghen and Jeff Hendrick sliding over the line together, there was no clear and obvious mistake. Mike Dean\u2019s decision became important in the context of the game because a goal resulted from the set piece, but VAR cannot be used in hindsight either. Even if an amount of guesswork on the part of the referee was necessarily involved, Tottenham should still have defended the corner better. <strong>Paul Wilson</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/23/burnley-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Burnley 2-1 Tottenham Hotspur</a></em></p> \n<h2>8) Gerard Deulofeu is coming of age</h2> \n<p>Gerard Deulofeu has promised much but failed to deliver since his arrival on English shores with as a fresh-faced 18-year-old with Everton in 2013 \u2013 yet could he finally be coming of age after his dazzling hat-trick left Cardiff City stunned? Growing up in Lionel Messi\u2019s shadow cannot be easy, especially after he was given one final shot at Camp Nou last season. But the shackles were off on Friday night as the Spaniard used the Cardiff City Stadium as his playground to lay bare Cardiff\u2019s defensive frailties. Playing around Troy Deeney, his irrepressible movement terrified Sean Morrison and co, and he had the cool head and firepower to make his chances count. His maturity in front of goal allowed him to pick out the bottom corner before calmly finishing a pair of one-on-ones. So could this be the game where Deulofeu proved he is ready to become one of the Premier League\u2019s better performers or will it prove to be another false dawn? <strong>James Candy</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/22/cardiff-city-watford-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Cardiff City 1-5 Watford</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95ea618d6a1bcc39c69be6eecfa3d2afabba31b7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95ea618d6a1bcc39c69be6eecfa3d2afabba31b7/0_54_4990_2995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gerard Deulofeu celebrates Watford\u2019s fourth goal, scored by Troy Deeney, against Cardiff.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gerard Deulofeu celebrates Watford\u2019s fourth goal, scored by Troy Deeney, against Cardiff.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2019/feb/24/the-dozen-the-weekends-best-premier-league-photos\">The Dozen: the weekend\u2019s best Premier League photos</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>9) Free-wheeling Zaha pays homage to Hodgson</h2> \n<p>Roy Hodgson celebrated becoming the oldest person to manage in the Premier League by witnessing his side dismantle Leicester. Having worked across Europe, Hodgson has learned how to get the best out of players of all styles and ages. The 71-year-old has finely tuned Wilfried Zaha since arriving at Selhurst Park, giving his star man the freedom he requires to earn points. There were another two goals for the winger on Saturday, making it the first time Zaha has scored in three consecutive Premier League games, earning praise from Hodgson who says Zaha is benefiting from concerted team effort to score more and, ironically, being liberated by having a central striker. Zaha proclaimed on Instagram: \u201cToday\u2019s win is for you gaffer,\u201d alongside a photo of a smiling Hodgson. They might use different platforms to show their mutual admiration, but they are certainly getting the best out of each other. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/23/leicester-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Leicester 1-4 Crystal Palace</a></em></p> \n<h2>10) Lejeune brings comfort to Newcastle</h2> \n<p>Newcastle fans welcomed Miguel Almir\u00f3n to Tyneside with a special \u201cWor Almir\u00f3n\u201d banner and, in return, the \u00a321m Paraguay playmaker brought searing pace, smart swivels and slick passes to the party. He and Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n competed for man of the match honours, with the midfielders Sean Longstaff and Isaac Hayden not far behind. But one man\u2019s influence should not be underestimated. Newcastle\u2019s shaky start to the season coincided with Florian Lejeune being sidelined with a ruptured cruciate ligament but since the centre-half\u2019s return they have improved appreciably. Lejeune is an excellent defender whose comfort on the ball, technical assurance and vision enables Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s 5-4-1 formation to switch seamlessly to an attacking 3-4-3. His party trick is switching play courtesy of long diagonal passes and the latest example prefaced Rond\u00f3n scoring the first goal against 10-man, all but relegated, Huddersfield. <strong>Louise

      "bodyText": "1) Shaw puts Salah in the shade Luke Shaw\u2019s display at Old Trafford was his best for Manchester United under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, according to the interim manager. To see Mohamed Salah replaced on 79 minutes was all the evidence required. Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201c[When] they take Mohamed Salah off you know Luke Shaw has played a good game.\u201d The left-back was a blur of defensive obstinacy. Solskj\u00e6r said Salah\u2019s threat meant Shaw could not attack as much as desired and this is understandable given the forward\u2019s quality. But the prevailing caveat regarding Shaw\u2019s contribution in most games is that he does not create enough when roving forward. If Shaw can add more overlapping play, crosses and bursts into the area then United will have an extra dimension and the potential that got him the move five years ago from Southampton will have finally been realised. Jamie Jackson \u2022 Match report: Manchester United 0-0 Liverpool 2) Hazard central to Chelsea\u2019s improved display Leaving Gonzalo Higua\u00edn on the bench until extra-time appeared bad faith in a big-name striker signed on an 18-month loan with attendant hefty wages. But with Eden Hazard as a central attacker, and Pedro and Willian flanking, Maurizio Sarri selected the trio who dug in for December\u2019s 2-0 defeat of City. This display was as solid as Chelsea have looked since and Hazard was licensed to exhibit his individual genius. The Belgian may be reluctant to play centrally but Sarri was in little position for taking a long-term view. With former manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, working as a TV pundit, unhelpfully reminding viewers of the broadcaster DAZN Spain that Hazard has \u201cthe talent and personality to wear the Real Madrid shirt\u201d, Chelsea\u2019s star may not be around beyond the short term. If Sunday was his final Wembley appearance for Chelsea, he graced the occasion; his Panenka shootout penalty was an impudent beauty. John Brewin \u2022 Match report: Manchester City 0-0 Chelsea (City won 4-3 on pens) 3) Ranieri confounds over Sessegnon At half-time, Claudio Ranieri removed Ryan Sessegnon and Jean Micha\u00ebl Seri: the latter because he might have otherwise been sent off, the former because the manager remains unconvinced by one of the brightest young talents in the country. Many things have gone wrong for Fulham this season, some of them out of their control, but the treatment of Sessegnon is increasingly curious. At 18 Sessegnon is not the answer to all their problems, but the issue is that he is not even being given the chance. Having set up their goal against West Ham with a forceful low cross and generally been their most threatening player, to take him off at the interval was baffling. It was hardly a surprise that, despite having the better of the second half, they could not create any clear chances, much less score a goal. Nick Miller \u2022 Match report: West Ham 3-1 Fulham 4) Nuno on hi-tech \u2013 and low cunning On the face of it, Wolves\u2019 1-1 draw at Bournemouth was a perfect advert for VAR. There were three dubious penalties and another that might have been given to Wolves for handball by Chris Mepham. But of the four, only Ivan Cavaliero\u2019s foul on Ryan Fraser \u2013 which was outside the area, and might not have been a foul anyway \u2013 was close to the \u201cclear and obvious error\u201d that is theoretically required for a decision to be overturned. The rest were all subjective. Though VAR in the Premier League will increase the number of correct decisions, it will also heighten the sense of injustice at the debatable ones. Once technology is used, players have a much greater entitlement to the correct decision \u2013 or, rather, the decision they perceive to be correct. The issue was summed up by the Wolves head coach, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, when he was asked whether the reaction of his players to certain decisions showed they were hard done by. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot always trust the reaction of the players \u2013 sometimes they cheat.\u201d The biggest problem with technology will always be humans. Rob Smyth \u2022 Match report: Bournemouth 1-1 Wolves 5) Manchester City women go Continental Manchester City, having fallen apart this time last year from a similarly unbeaten starting point, have found the answer to staying competitive across the board and their blueprint may well be one Arsenal will pore over come the summer even if the Gunners stumble first across the finish line in the league. Arsenal have been bullish in their assertion that the league, and Champions League, have been their priority. Yet City have shown this season that compromising one trophy for another does not have to be a given. \u201cWe knew that we wanted to still be in the FA Cup, we\u2019ve done that; we wanted to stay top of the league, we\u2019ve done that; and to come here and win the third game of the week shows what a great squad we have, the great staff we have behind us and all the great work people don\u2019t see,\u201d said City\u2019s captain, Steph Houghton. Suzanne Wrack \u2022 Match report: Manchester City 0-0 Arsenal (City won 4-2 on pens) 6) Reversal puts Hasenh\u00fcttl in a fix When Southampton ended Arsenal\u2019s 22-match unbeaten run on 16 December at St Mary\u2019s \u2013 in Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s second game in charge \u2013 it was a performance and occasion that teemed with intensity; a clear example of a new-manager bounce. At the Emirates on Sunday, the most striking aspect of the club\u2019s 2-0 defeat was their flatness and fragility. Hasenh\u00fcttl had enjoyed two clear weeks to prepare for it after the home loss to Cardiff but his team conceded the goals early on and fell apart. They could have leaked four or five by half-time. Individual errors remain a massive problem and can Hasenh\u00fcttl legislate for those? But the broader picture is two points from an available 12 and a group of players that look inhibited. Hasenh\u00fcttl appeared to have the weight of the world on his shoulders afterwards. He has to find a way to unlock the tension. David Hytner \u2022 Match report: Arsenal 2-1 Southampton 7) Turf Moor\u2019s elephant in the corner The presence of VAR was also felt at Turf Moor \u2013 though there is no truth in the rumour that it would have sorted out the confusion over the award of the corner that led to Burnley\u2019s first goal against Tottenham. VAR is not going to be wheeled out next season for every toss-of-a-coin line decision in the course of a game and in any case, given that there was still room for debate even after several slow-motion replays of Jan Vertonghen and Jeff Hendrick sliding over the line together, there was no clear and obvious mistake. Mike Dean\u2019s decision became important in the context of the game because a goal resulted from the set piece, but VAR cannot be used in hindsight either. Even if an amount of guesswork on the part of the referee was necessarily involved, Tottenham should still have defended the corner better. Paul Wilson \u2022 Match report: Burnley 2-1 Tottenham Hotspur 8) Gerard Deulofeu is coming of age Gerard Deulofeu has promised much but failed to deliver since his arrival on English shores with as a fresh-faced 18-year-old with Everton in 2013 \u2013 yet could he finally be coming of age after his dazzling hat-trick left Cardiff City stunned? Growing up in Lionel Messi\u2019s shadow cannot be easy, especially after he was given one final shot at Camp Nou last season. But the shackles were off on Friday night as the Spaniard used the Cardiff City Stadium as his playground to lay bare Cardiff\u2019s defensive frailties. Playing around Troy Deeney, his irrepressible movement terrified Sean Morrison and co, and he had the cool head and firepower to make his chances count. His maturity in front of goal allowed him to pick out the bottom corner before calmly finishing a pair of one-on-ones. So could this be the game where Deulofeu proved he is ready to become one of the Premier League\u2019s better performers or will it prove to be another false dawn? James Candy \u2022 Match report: Cardiff City 1-5 Watford 9) Free-wheeling Zaha pays homage to Hodgson Roy Hodgson celebrated becoming the oldest person to manage in the Premier League by witnessing his side dismantle Leicester. Having worked across Europe, Hodgson has learned how to get the best out of players of all styles and ages. The 71-year-old has finely tuned Wilfried Zaha since arriving at Selhurst Park, giving his star man the freedom he requires to earn points. There were another two goals for the winger on Saturday, making it the first time Zaha has scored in three consecutive Premier League games, earning praise from Hodgson who says Zaha is benefiting from concerted team effort to score more and, ironically, being liberated by having a central striker. Zaha proclaimed on Instagram: \u201cToday\u2019s win is for you gaffer,\u201d alongside a photo of a smiling Hodgson. They might use different platforms to show their mutual admiration, but they are certainly getting the best out of each other. Will Unwin \u2022 Match report: Leicester 1-4 Crystal Palace 10) Lejeune brings comfort to Newcastle Newcastle fans welcomed Miguel Almir\u00f3n to Tyneside with a special \u201cWor Almir\u00f3n\u201d banner and, in return, the \u00a321m Paraguay playmaker brought searing pace, smart swivels and slick passes to the party. He and Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n competed for man of the match honours, with the midfielders Sean Longstaff and Isaac Hayden not far behind. But one man\u2019s influence should not be underestimated. Newcastle\u2019s shaky start to the season coincided with Florian Lejeune being sidelined with a ruptured cruciate ligament but since the centre-half\u2019s return they have improved appreciably. Lejeune is an excellent defender whose comfort on the ball, technical assurance and vision enables Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s 5-4-1 formation to switch seamlessly to an attacking 3-4-3. His party trick is switching play courtesy of long diagonal passes and the latest example prefaced Rond\u00f3n scoring the first goal against 10-man, all but relegated, Huddersfield.

      "bodyText": "Indigenous newborns and babies less than one year old are being removed from their parents and placed into out-of-home care at increased rates, a study by the Telethon Institute has found. The study, published in the journal of Child Abuse and Neglect, said that Indigenous infants in Western Australia had been removed and placed into out-of-home care at 10 times the rate of non-Indigenous infants and warned it should be \u201cseen as a priority requiring urgent action to prevent further intergenerational trauma\u201d. Nationally rates of child removal for Indigenous children of all ages are 10 times higher than rates of removal for non-Indigenous children, a 21% increase from 2012, but there is limited national data on the removal of infants. The study compared data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare with data from WA child protection services and found \u201cevidence of increasing early removal\u201d. One of the authors was Professor Rhonda Marriott, a Nyikina woman and the pro vice chancellor of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leadership at Murdoch University. She said Aboriginal parents did not seem to be granted \u201cthe same amount of consideration and leniency\u201d by child protection workers. \u201cThere is anecdotal evidence that the number of children that are being removed as babies from places like King Edward Memorial hospital is rising,\u201d Marriott said. \u201cWe definitely have this sense that the department has given up and doesn\u2019t quite know what to do.\u201d An analysis of WA child removal data from 1990 to 2010 showed that the most common factors present in cases where babies were removed as infants was a substance abuse notification against the mother, followed by a mental health notification against the mother, and the remoteness of their home community. Marriott said many of those who had their child removed were young mothers who had themselves grown up in out-of-home care and because they present with risk factors are not given a chance to parent. \u201cHope is a very easy thing to lose, and a very hard thing to regain,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere we leave families without hope it is a pretty tragic thing.\u201d She said Aboriginal child welfare workers were also concerned that controversial adoption laws introduced in New South Wales, which allow for the adoption of children in the foster system without parental consent, could be introduced in other jurisdictions. Marriott said government should put money into supporting parenting services for those mothers, but added that any new investment should be co-designed with Aboriginal community-controlled organisations. Governments are introducing more co-designed programs, but Marriott said the process was overly bureaucratic and progress slow. Muriel Bamblett, the chairperson of the Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care (Snaicc) and the chief executive of the Victorian Aboriginal Child Care Agency, said rates of child protection notifications against babies less than 12 months old were on the rise. Last year, 20.1% of the 663 unborn notifications (meaning child protection risks that were flagged during pregnancy) on Aboriginal mothers in Victoria were substantiated. For non-Indigenous mothers, just 12.4% of unborn notifications were substantiated. She said the difference could be attributed to substance abuse, particularly the increased use of methamphetamines and \u201cice\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy when we are waiting at hospitals for babies to be born because there are serious issues with the parents and the risk to the baby is very high,\u201d she said. Bamblett said there were some isolated programs, such as the Bumps to Babes program run by Mallee District Aboriginal Services, that had succeeded in reducing child protection rates by combining prenatal and parenting classes. Involvement in the child protection system was a common theme in a recent WA coronial report into Indigenous youth suicide. One of the 42 recommendations was to appoint a commissioner for Aboriginal children and young people who would have oversight of child protection matters.

It tells the story of how William, then 14, was forced to drop out of school during a deadly famine that struck Malawi in 2000-2001. As his family and neighbors slowly starved, he found refuge in a local library, where he discovered books that inspired him to build a series of windmills from tractor and bicycle partsto produce electricity for his village, and to eventually pump water.

It dealt with Malawi and those deep family dynamics in a real way, and it was a space that I recognized. Look, there is no generic Africa.

People can identify and find solutions for their own issues, as opposed to being presented as victims everyone else is going to help. We\u2019ve tried it that way, this paternalistic way, and it\u2019s disempowering.</p> <p><strong>I love how the movie, which has an entirely black cast, has allowed you to talk about diversity in film. Throughout your career, you\u2019ve come back to Africa \u2013 playing Patrice Lumumba in the play A Season in the Congo at London\u2019s Young Vic, starred in the adaptation of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s Half a Yellow Sun, addressed apartheid in Endgame and Red Dust, and now you\u2019re directing this film \u2026</strong></p> <p>There are epic stories to be told there. I\u2019ve always been excited by the combination of these western traditions of cinema and these epic stories in Africa. There\u2019s always been an overlap that\u2019s been rarely explored. There\u2019s a rich narrative landscape for people to embrace and fall in love with.</p> <p><strong>The film is shot entirely in William\u2019s village in Wimbe. Because of that, you were able to accomplish a rare feat \u2013 realistically portray African village life, which doesn\u2019t make it into western living rooms that often.</strong></p> <p>Right, that day to day living. How you get up in the morning, how you have a shower [laughs]. People don\u2019t have a context for that because they\u2019re seeing Africa in these headline-ish ways and they lose the connection to people who are just doing normal things and have the same desires as them. It\u2019s important to take the audience into this private space.</p> <p><strong>You mentioned somewhere that one of your first references before making the film were the impressionist painters, and how they\u2019d managed to capture these peasants in rural, impoverished France with such romanticism, scope, and beauty. Any other inspirations?</strong></p> <p>I stated looking at Vittorio De Sica\u2019s Bicycle Thieves, a film that I\u2019ve always loved. I felt like that neo-realism had such a resonance for me. Post-war Italy dealing with all that poverty, that broken structure, and yet this father and son at the center of it finding this new space to communicate and express themselves was a very influential story, not to mention the bicycle at the center.</p> <p>Another major influence was Haile Gerima and his film Harvest: 3,000 Years. Released in 1977, it\u2019s about the famine in Ethiopia. I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere and finally the British Film Institute had a copy they screened for me. I could watch that film every day for 1,000 years. I actually went to meet Gerima in Washington to talk with him and get his advice. He was very moved that William was stressed by the conditions of his family, and he said that was the heart of his motivation, that somehow subconsciously he was aware that these conditions were wrong, that something was broken in the expression of humanity. His motivating energy was to reconnect with what things should be. </p> <p><strong>You famously learned to play violin for the role of Solomon Northup in 12 Years a Slave. For The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, you and several others in the cast had to learn Chichewa during the 37 days on location. Which was easier, learning violin or Chichewa?</strong></p> <p>[Laughs] Chichewa. Violin is complex. It\u2019s not that complicated to look like you <em>kind of</em> know what you\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s extremely complicated to look like you <em>really</em> know what you\u2019re doing.</p>",

Throughout your career, you\u2019ve come back to Africa \u2013 playing Patrice Lumumba in the play A Season in the Congo at London\u2019s Young Vic, starred in the adaptation of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s Half a Yellow Sun, addressed apartheid in Endgame and Red Dust, and now you\u2019re directing this film \u2026 There are epic stories to be told there. I\u2019ve always been excited by the combination of these western traditions of cinema and these epic stories in Africa. There\u2019s always been an overlap that\u2019s been rarely explored. There\u2019s a rich narrative landscape for people to embrace and fall in love with. The film is shot entirely in William\u2019s village in Wimbe. Because of that, you were able to accomplish a rare feat \u2013 realistically portray African village life, which doesn\u2019t make it into western living rooms that often. Right, that day to day living. How you get up in the morning, how you have a shower [laughs]. People don\u2019t have a context for that because they\u2019re seeing Africa in these headline-ish ways and they lose the connection to people who are just doing normal things and have the same desires as them. It\u2019s important to take the audience into this private space. You mentioned somewhere that one of your first references before making the film were the impressionist painters, and how they\u2019d managed to capture these peasants in rural, impoverished France with such romanticism, scope, and beauty. Any other inspirations? I stated looking at Vittorio De Sica\u2019s Bicycle Thieves, a film that I\u2019ve always loved. I felt like that neo-realism had such a resonance for me. Post-war Italy dealing with all that poverty, that broken structure, and yet this father and son at the center of it finding this new space to communicate and express themselves was a very influential story, not to mention the bicycle at the center. Another major influence was Haile Gerima and his film Harvest: 3,000 Years. Released in 1977, it\u2019s about the famine in Ethiopia. I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere and finally the British Film Institute had a copy they screened for me. I could watch that film every day for 1,000 years. I actually went to meet Gerima in Washington to talk with him and get his advice. He was very moved that William was stressed by the conditions of his family, and he said that was the heart of his motivation, that somehow subconsciously he was aware that these conditions were wrong, that something was broken in the expression of humanity. His motivating energy was to reconnect with what things should be. You famously learned to play violin for the role of Solomon Northup in 12 Years a Slave. For The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, you and several others in the cast had to learn Chichewa during the 37 days on location. Which was easier, learning violin or Chichewa? [Laughs] Chichewa. Violin is complex. It\u2019s not that complicated to look like you kind of know what you\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s extremely complicated to look like you really know what you\u2019re doing.",

Not only do you not have to attend a party conference ever again, you can hold (as I did) an annual event in your constituency which is all party and no conference. Second, the next time around, stand for re-election. It will not be easy, especially against the candidates of your former parties, but in an age of weaker party allegiances it surely can be done.

(The same applies to Ann Widdecombe, but that is another story.)</p> <p>Fourth and last, the stakes have never been higher. As we blunder towards the cliff edge of a no-deal Brexit, it seems to remainers and Europhiles like myself that our last chance of salvation lies with a group of truly honourable members who have left the parties to save the people, all of us.</p> <p>\u2022 Martin Bell is a former television war correspondent and politician</p>",

He must have forgiven me, because years later when we shared a platform at a public event he gave me a big hug. And when you have been hugged by Eric Pickles, you have really been hugged. (The same applies to Ann Widdecombe, but that is another story.) Fourth and last, the stakes have never been higher. As we blunder towards the cliff edge of a no-deal Brexit, it seems to remainers and Europhiles like myself that our last chance of salvation lies with a group of truly honourable members who have left the parties to save the people, all of us. \u2022 Martin Bell is a former television war correspondent and politician",

      "body": "<p>On a summer\u2019s evening in early June 2017, Ashley Heavyrunner Loring messaged some friends on Facebook, looking for a ride into town from her family\u2019s ranch on the sprawling Blackfeet reservation in north-west Montana. As she waited for the friend to arrive, she grabbed some clothes, packed them into a blue string backpack and said goodbye to her grandmother. Then she ran outside to the waiting car.</p> \n<p>Later that night, someone posted a short video of a party somewhere on the \u201crez\u201d. In it was Ashley, then aged 20, nestled on a couch, surrounded by people drinking beers and chatting. At one point, Ashley messaged her older sister Kimberly, who was in Morocco visiting her fiance.</p> \n<p>\u201cSend me some muns [money], can you,\u201d wrote Ashley.</p> \n<p>\u201cI wish I can sis but I\u2019m in Africa,\u201d Kimberly responded. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p> \n<p>Days passed. Kimberly, 25, had since returned to the US, but Ashley\u2019s phone wouldn\u2019t pick up. Kimberly didn\u2019t think too much of it; Ashley was always losing her mobile. And anyway, the sisters \u2013 who had grown up together wrangling horses, chopping wood and shoveling snow \u2013 had a plan. After months of living on the ranch and attending community college in the reservation\u2019s down-and-out capital, Browning, Ashley would finally be joining her sister in Missoula, a bohemian university town where they would share an apartment and start a new life together.</p> \n<p>But a week went by without a word from Ashley. By mid-June, when their father was suddenly hospitalised for liver failure, Kimberly panicked. Where was her sister? She made some phone calls.</p> \n<p>That was when she discovered that no one had seen Ashley since the night of the party.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>There is no single database that tracks the number of Native women who go missing or are murdered every year. But <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/2017-ncic-missing-person-and-unidentified-person-statistics.pdf/view\">FBI</a> figures show that Native Americans disappear at twice the per capita rate of white Americans \u2013 despite comprising a far smaller population. Last year, after more than two dozen Native Americans, most of them women, went missing in Montana alone, state senator Jon Tester declared the number of missing and murdered Indigenous women (MMIW) across America an \u201cepidemic\u201d and vowed to find solutions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b09159a9fed50355dfa278adf94c4a1d41a08b17\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b09159a9fed50355dfa278adf94c4a1d41a08b17/0_193_4320_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ashley Heavyrunner Loring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashley Heavyrunner Loring.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Silverstone/Courtesy the Heavyrunner Loring family</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cPeople ask me: \u2018Why are these women going missing? Is it the cartels?\u2019\u201d says cartographer Annita Lucchesi, a Southern Cheyenne descendant who is building the first ever US- and Canada-wide database devoted solely to missing and murdered indigenous women.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the cartels \u2013 although that does happen \u2013 it\u2019s the devaluation of Native women.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lucchesi points to the harrowing rates of sexual assault, murder and domestic violence suffered by Native women \u2013 some of the highest in America \u2013 as evidence. More than 84% will experience violence at some point in their lifetime, according to a 2016<a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/249736.pdf\"> National Institute of Justice report</a>. One in three will be raped (compared to one in five white women), and 96% of all sexual violence suffered by Native women will be committed by non-Native men. In some counties, the murder rate of Native women is 10 times higher than for any other race in America, according to the <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/223691.pdf\">Department of Justice</a>.</p> \n<p>Yet arrests and prosecutions are notoriously low, whether crimes against Native women are committed on the reservations or off them, says Lucchesi.</p> \n<p>\u201cI know people imagine this is something that happens mostly in Montana or North Dakota, but the thing I want to stress to people is that it happens everywhere. Some of the [places] that have the highest numbers [of MMIW] are actually liberal cities like Seattle, Portland and Denver,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>\u201c[When] you don\u2019t see law enforcement holding up people who are accountable for hurting Native women, it becomes this culture where the only way anybody can ever see us is as victims and easy targets.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>When the Loring family reported Ashley missing to the Blackfeet reservation\u2019s tribal police force, which, along with federal agents from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) serves as law enforcement to the sovereign nation, they were stunned by the response.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo one took it seriously,\u201d says Kimberly, shaking her head. \u201cThey just said: \u2018She\u2019s of age, she can leave when she wants to.\u2019 When we talk to other families whose girls went missing, they say that\u2019s what they got from law enforcement, too. It\u2019s not a proper response.\u201d</p> \n<p>The reservation\u2013 a vast 1.5m-acre expanse larger than Delaware, bordering the Rocky Mountains to the west and Canada to the north \u2013 was usually flooded with gossip. But all had gone quiet after Ashley\u2019s disappearance.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e63dc7309aa8eca2583909db5d84bbb09be9be2f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e63dc7309aa8eca2583909db5d84bbb09be9be2f/167_0_2499_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ashley\u2019s sister, Kimberley Heavyrunner Loring, who has been searching for her since June 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashley\u2019s sister, Kimberley Heavyrunner Loring, who has been searching for her since June 2017.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Then, in late June, the first lead came in \u2013 two weeks after Ashley was last seen. A young woman had been spotted running from a vehicle on a desolate stretch of Route 89, flanked on either side by swamp, dense forest and the occasional trailer. A three-day search party was organised by tribal police and the BIA, but came up empty. Volunteers found a grey sweater believed to be Ashley\u2019s in a nearby dump, says Kimberly, but authorities misplaced it before they were able to do any testing. It would then take authorities <a href=\"http://www.mtpr.org/post/updated-senate-committee-hears-testimony-missing-and-murdered-indigenous-women?fbclid=IwAR1xP0z4N9KTA_su5aLZmVuh2bbit7DOT5On8pLcH4uzi4pjqudCdaeHxFQ\">two full months</a> to launch a proper investigation into Ashley\u2019s case, by which point the lead investigator had started a relationship with, and was leaking information to, a prime suspect, Kimberly claims.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was ridiculous. One of the [tribal] officers actually apologised to me. He said he was sorry about my sister and that he was working overtime on the case, but that nobody was taking it seriously,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople in Browning know exactly what happened to my sister and where she\u2019s at, but they\u2019re not speaking up because law enforcement ruined her case.\u201d</p> \n<p>Faced with the seeming indifference of the authorities, Kimberly took matters into her own hands, becoming her sister\u2019s de-facto detective. She trekked up and down the mountains looking for clues, calling Ashley\u2019s name, scrambling into rocky ravines, digging up fresh mounds of earth, analysing bones, chasing off grizzly bears. She followed every lead \u2013 many of them infuriatingly vague and horribly gruesome \u2013 and took every phone call, read every message, met anyone on the street who wanted to talk. She searched with friends, family, pet dogs and the occasional wildlife ranger \u2013 but often she was alone, armed with little more than bear spray and Camel Menthols.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen a person goes missing, there isn\u2019t a book that will tell you: \u2018You need to do this and do that.\u2019 You have to just learn it on your own,\u201d sighs Kimberly. \u201cEvery day is a nightmare. We don\u2019t know what really happened to her. There\u2019s rumours about her being hurt and her body put places, being all cut up and scattered on the mountain.\u201d She squeezes her eyes shut to stop the tears. \u201cThat\u2019s why I search for her. That\u2019s why I go out in the mountains and look. I don\u2019t want my baby sister laying out there alone.\u201d</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a concern that Matthew Lone Bear, an enrolled member of the Three Affiliated Tribes, knows well. His own sister Olivia, a 32-year-old mother of five, went out for a drink and game of bingo one night in October 2017 on the Fort Berthold reservation in North Dakota, then disappeared \u2013 along with the Chevy Silverado she had been driving.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere was no big ol\u2019 conspiracy. Everything was fine with her. Nothing was out of the ordinary,\u201d he says. \u201cBut tribal PD [police department] were terrible,\u201d he says. Instead of searching for her, \u201cthey just kept hoping she\u2019d come home. They never had answers for us.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e1088e77c6421605837667aea95867a07e3bbd9a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1088e77c6421605837667aea95867a07e3bbd9a/107_0_2499_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Lone Bear with the drone he uses to search for missing Native Americans.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Lone Bear with the drone he uses to search for missing Native Americans.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Like Kimberly, Lone Bear quickly realised he would have to step in where he believed the authorities were lacking. He moved back onto the reservation and set up a headquarters stocked with snacks and water bottles, mapped out the surrounding areas using land surveys, enlisted locals to man search parties, and set up an anonymous tipline and fundraising page.</p> \n<p>When a donor finally purchased the DJI Phantom 3 drone on the search group\u2019s Amazon wishlist, Lone Bear taught himself the basics and found his search strategy changed entirely.</p> \n<p>\u201cI thought we could cover a lot more ground with a drone,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe Fort Berthold reservation is just shy of a million acres. And we got badlands, flats, farmland, a lot of private land, tribal land, army corps land \u2026 and it\u2019s right in the middle of the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/26/north-dakota-oil-boom-mans-land\"> Bakken [oil reserve]</a>, so that\u2019s a lotta land to cover.\u201d He clasps his hands together as he looks out, recalling the memory. \u201cLaw enforcement was tellin\u2019 us we gotta hold hands and walk across a field [to search]. If you\u2019re gonna deal with a million acres, there\u2019s no dang way \u2013 you\u2019re gonna be sittin\u2019 there for the next 10 years!\u201d</p> \n<p>Lone Bear was meticulous in his approach to looking for Olivia. After creating a timeline of her last known movements, he logged every tip received \u2013 nearly 400 of them \u2013 and recorded every drone and foot search. Perhaps most crucially of all, he also drew up frequent press releases to keep Olivia\u2019s case ever-present in the news.</p> \n<p>\u201cI spent a lot of time looking at these [missing persons] cases, and there are so many times where law enforcement really doesn\u2019t investigate: they spend more time trying to make excuses why not to [search] than actually just getting out there and getting it done,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you look across the United States at all the different reservations, even off reservation, when Native people are missing, they don\u2019t get the same resources, and they don\u2019t get the same type of [press] coverage, when white people are missing.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>Ten months after she was reported missing, Olivia\u2019s body was<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/missing-in-america/fbi-confident-body-found-submerged-truck-belongs-missing-mother-olivia-n897546\"> found submerged in the Chevy Silverado at the bottom of a lake</a> less than a mile from her house. In the end, it was a volunteer search team using sonar \u2013 not tribal, state or federal authorities \u2013 that were credited with finding her body.</p> \n<p>The FBI is currently investigating the case. But the anguish and rage Lone Bear feels at not knowing what exactly happened to his sister have fuelled his desire to change the system. He is now drafting a missing person protocol that would help tribal governments \u201ccut out the red tape\u201d and streamline their approach so that \u201cif a family calls for resources and resources ain\u2019t comin\u2019 in \u2026 some kind of emergency procedure\u201d gets triggered, he says.</p> \n<p>At the top of his to-do list was helping the Loring family. For three days in late September, he flew the Phantom 3 over Route 89 and other key search areas, looking into leads Kimberly had recently received, including one about an alleged beaver dam where Ashley\u2019s body may have been laid to rest.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"636331606c4d4301d85c6ee24a2cdd03de7b5955\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/636331606c4d4301d85c6ee24a2cdd03de7b5955/0_0_2499_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kimberley Heavyrunner Loring and her cousin look for Ashley on the Blackfeet reservation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kimberley Heavyrunner Loring and her cousin look for Ashley on the Blackfeet reservation.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Lone Bear leaned against his Ford Explorer and toggled the drone down a steep ravine towards a creek. From above, the reservation was awash with colour and texture. There were the vast expanses of charred, blackened hills, the result of recent forest fires; narrow ribbons of road zigzagging towards the mountain tops; swamps glittering in the sunshine; tall Douglas firs, straight as soldiers; and long grasses flattened by sleeping bears.</p> \n<p>As I joined Kimberly in searching on foot in the thick of it all, the drone buzzing high overhead, it became apparent that off every tiny trail, over every deserted rocky mountain path, lay evidence of not just human activity, but human detritus. Vodka bottles, beer cans, car keys, cigarette stubs, golf tees, stained T-shirts, clean shorts and smashed glass littered the earth. Everywhere, it seemed, was a party spot \u2013 and every party spot was a dumping ground.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s party spots all over the reservation, a lot of \u2019em in the woods, in the mountains, out in the prairies,\u201d states Blackfeet reservation police officer Isaiah Webber matter of factly, a thick wad of chewing tobacco jutting his lower jaw forward. \u201cThese kids, they grow up and they see their parents drinking a lot, partying, they see domestic violence in their home, and they\u2019re left with that choice: \u2018Well, my mom\u2019s drinking, she\u2019s too hungover to take me to school, so I\u2019m just gonna drink, too.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Webber, an enrolled member of the tribe who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, is just one of 18 officers covering the reservation, an area so huge that by the time police have been alerted to a crime, the perpetrator has many times already fled the scene. Unemployment on the reservation hovers around 40%. Most of the force\u2019s call-outs are alcohol-related, but meth and opioid use have also spiked recently, inflating both petty and violent crimes from break-ins to stabbings.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are undermanned,\u201d Webber admits. \u201cEven if you have a full shift of five officers, you still have to cover the whole reservation, all one and a half million acres. This is the most officers that Browning\u2019s ever had, and we\u2019re barely keeping up.\u201d</p> \n<p>Webber appears chagrined over Ashley\u2019s disappearance. He logged multiple hours on the case, he says, following through on vague leads, many of them from self-proclaimed clairvoyants that ultimately led nowhere. One day, he found himself digging nearly 6ft into the ground after finding a fresh mound of earth obscured beneath a bridge. \u201cIt looked like it could\u2019ve been a body,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it was just a fire pit someone had covered up.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"116d9921eecea8f7eb35777b3e3f0f206bd00d69\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/116d9921eecea8f7eb35777b3e3f0f206bd00d69/51_0_2499_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police officer Isaiah Webber outside one of the reservation\u2019s \u2018party houses\u2019, one of the last places Ashley Heavyrunner Loring was seen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officer Isaiah Webber outside one of the reservation\u2019s \u2018party houses\u2019, one of the last places Ashley Heavyrunner Loring was seen.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Blackfeet people\u2019s turbulent and often violent history at the hands of government authorities means that many locals are reluctant to come forward with any information \u2013 for fear that they will be somehow punished or get into trouble themselves, says Tana Fleury of the Blackfeet Domestic Violence Center. Fleury cites just a few US-government practices over the years that have instilled distrust: the forced placement of Native children in boarding schools (some parents who refused were<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/alca/learn/historyculture/hopi-prisoners-on-the-rock.htm\"> imprisoned on Alcatraz</a>); the forced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/30/ama-review-lorna-tucker-native-americans-mass-sterilisation\">sterilisation of Native women</a> in the 1970s; the overrepresentation of <a href=\"https://www.nicwa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Disproportionality-Table.pdf\">Native children in foster care</a>; and the <a href=\"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lakota-peoples-law/uploads/Native-Lives-Matter-PDF.pdf\">disproportionately high incarceration rates</a> of Native men and women across America (four times higher than white men, and six times higher than white women, respectively).</p> \n<p>The result is that families lie low and mind their own business, says Fleury. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get involved. We don\u2019t want to report it. It has everything to do with that historical trauma and seeing the police as [wielding] authority over us.\u201d</p> \n<p>Having failed to make any arrests regarding Ashley\u2019s case, Webber knows that the tribal police department may be judged as having failed both the Loring family as well as the reservation. \u201cIt\u2019s tough for the family to get closure,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s tough for the community, because they place their faith in us to bring people to justice, to uphold the law, to investigate these things. But the people who have seen her or the people who gave us information don\u2019t want to talk; they don\u2019t want to get themselves or whoever did it in trouble.\u201d</p> \n<p>He shrugs his shoulders and clasps his hands over his gun belt. \u201cIf someone won\u2019t talk, they won\u2019t talk, and it just becomes another cold case, another dead end, another statistic on this reservation.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>\u201cFeisty\u201d is the word friends and family use most to describe Ashley, a tiny, buoyant brunette standing at 5\u20192\u201d (157cm) and weighing just 90lbs (41kg), but someone who knew how to stand up for herself. \u201cShe is strong \u2013 spiritually, emotionally, mentally, physically,\u201d says Ashley\u2019s best friend from childhood Erica Denney, 22, so upset by her disappearance that she mixes the present and past tenses to describe her. \u201cShe\u2019d stick up for people. If someone was getting bullied or if she saw something that was wrong, she would come out and tell you.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why never in a million years would you think [it would be] Ashley. All of a sudden she\u2019s just missing. She didn\u2019t even get to see her 21st birthday \u2026 She had plans. She had goals. And someone took that from her.\u201d</p> \n<p>The lack of answers is driving Ashley\u2019s family mad, says her father Roy Lee Heavyrunner, 47, a former firefighter who was in the hospital when she disappeared. \u201cI used to just sit at the window and stare and scream,\u201d he drawls, his speech slurring from a heavy cocktail of pain medications. \u201cI fear she suffered something painful. Agonising. Horrible. My little girl.\u201d He gazes out toward the battered houses lining his street, some of them boarded up with \u201cMeth Unit\u201d scrawled across in spray paint. Whoever had a hand in her disappearance is likely still on the reservation, he says, perhaps \u201csomeone I see every day\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c29d07af75882c76739c797f48e96403785e13c7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c29d07af75882c76739c797f48e96403785e13c7/83_0_2499_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ashley\u2019s father, Roy Lee Heavyrunner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashley\u2019s father, Roy Lee Heavyrunner.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In December, Kimberly was invited by Montana senators Jon Tester, a Democrat, and Steve Daines, a Republican, to speak about Ashley\u2019s case at a US Senate committee on the \u201csilent crisis\u201d of missing and murdered women in Indian country, a legal term referring to reservations and other Native lands where tribal and federal laws apply, but state laws do not. In Montana alone, Native women make up just 3% of the state population, but comprise <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/cb6efc4ec93e4e92900ec99ccbcb7e05\">30% of all missing persons</a>. Kimberly delineated the many ways in which she believed tribal and federal authorities had failed to perform their duties in regards to Ashley\u2019s case.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am asking you to recognize that Indigenous women matter, and the way our missing and murdered women cases are handled needs to be corrected,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will no longer be the invisible people in the United States of America.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Canada, where Native women comprise just 4% of the total population but nearly 16% of all female homicide victims, a<a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/indigenous-northern-affairs/news/2018/06/government-of-canada--national-inquiry-into-missing-and-murdered-indigenous-women-and-girls.html\"> national inquiry was launched</a> in 2016 after police racism was determined to have likely caused severe underreporting of MMIW cases. Its findings are due later this year. Speaking at the December hearing, Tester demanded an American reckoning.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the problem?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs it with the BIA? Is it with the FBI? Is it with tribal law enforcement? Why are we not finding these people? We have got to find a solution to this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tester has since <a href=\"https://www.tester.senate.gov/files/Legislation/MMIW%20GAO%20Bill%20Text.pdf\">introduced a bill</a> requiring a federal investigation of each law enforcement agency\u2019s jurisdiction over MMIW, as well as helped to reintroduce Savanna\u2019s Act, a federal bill which would improve data collection related to MMIW cases as well as streamline communication between authorities.</p> \n<p>The bill \u2013 named after Savanna Lafontaine-Greywind, 22, an enrolled member of the Spirit Lake tribe who was eight months pregnant when she was murdered and had her baby cut from her womb by a white neighbour \u2013 nearly passed last year but was <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/12/representative-bob-goodlatte-stalls-on-savannas-act.html\">blocked at the last minute</a> by a single member of Congress. Along with the recent election of two Native women to Congress \u2013 in addition to the introduction of legislation aimed at addressing MMIW in at least seven states, among them Montana and North Dakota \u2013 some change may finally be afoot.</p> \n<p>But activists have also pointed to a 40-year-old legal loophole as a target for reform. The 1978 US supreme court decision Oliphant v Suquamish<em> </em>ruled that<em> </em>tribes cannot arrest or prosecute non-Natives who commit crimes on Native land. In practice, this means that tribal police can arrest a Native man if he assaults a Native woman, but if that Native woman is assaulted by a non-Native, only a federal agent has authority. US attorneys then decide if they want to prosecute; but the latest figures show that federal prosecutors<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/tribal/page/file/1032116/download\"> declined nearly half (46%)</a> of all Indian country cases in 2016, many of them sexual assault cases.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem and incredibly complicated,\u201d says Cherokee lawyer Mary Kathryn Nagle, who specialises in tribal sovereignty. \u201cThe US Congress and supreme court have created a legal framework that even attorneys with years of education and fieldwork can have disagreements over [in regards to] who has jurisdiction.\u201d</p> \n<p>In one well-known case, Nagle says, after a non-Native man tried to shoot his Native ex-wife (but shot her co-worker instead), six different authorities argued over whose jurisdiction the case fell under \u2013 and in the end resorted to using a tape measure and map to resolve it.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need the right to prosecute \u2013 we had it before and it\u2019s been taken away from us,\u201d says Nagle. \u201cIt\u2019s well known that tribal governments can\u2019t prosecute. And these men who want to commit crimes see this opportunity and seize it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Former North Dakota senator Heidi Heitkamp, who initially introduced Savanna\u2019s Act to Congress, likens this jurisdictional black hole to a hunt in which non-Native men are the hunters and Native women the targets.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have prosecutions, you have no deterrents,\u201d Heitkamp said at the December hearing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s open season on people who live in Indian country.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63643c879fc5e52a72ec7f753d35d6896d4af45b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63643c879fc5e52a72ec7f753d35d6896d4af45b/0_648_4320_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kimberly and Ashley Heavyrunner Loring with their father, Roy Lee Heavyrunner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kimberly and Ashley Heavyrunner Loring with their father, Roy Lee Heavyrunner.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Silverstone/Courtesy the Heavyrunner Loring family</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For now, Kimberly is happy that positive action is on the horizon. The visit to Washington allowed Ashley\u2019s case to be properly heard for the first time since her sister went missing, she says. After a number of leads took investigators off the reservation and into other states, the FBI took over the case. And remarkably, the grey sweater she believes belonged to Ashley and was initially mislaid by authorities has also been found and is now being tested in a lab, she adds.</p> \n<p>In a recent post on Facebook \u2013 where Kimberly often shares photos of her sister as well as the missing poster offering a $10,000 reward \u2013 Kimberly described the day in November 1996 when Ashley was born.</p> \n<p>\u201cI remember walking up to a bed with pink blankets and my mom saying: \u2018Come meet your baby sister, Ashley.\u2019 I looked at her, and at that moment I knew I would always love her. I knew I had to protect her and I would always stand up for her,\u201d wrote Kimberly.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy bond with my sister is so strong, no one can break it. My love for my Ashley has no limit that it allows me to stand up and never give up looking for her. I know if I was in her shoes, she would be fighting just as hard if not harder. She would be standing up demanding answers. My sister is a beautiful, intelligent young woman [who] has goals and dreams. Being a missing and murdered Indigenous woman was not one of them.\u201d</p> \n<p><br><br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2018/04/lynchings-video/v/1524742833223/assets/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2018/04/lynchings-video/v/1524742833223/assets/boot.js\" data-alt=\"-\"> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "On a summer\u2019s evening in early June 2017, Ashley Heavyrunner Loring messaged some friends on Facebook, looking for a ride into town from her family\u2019s ranch on the sprawling Blackfeet reservation in north-west Montana. As she waited for the friend to arrive, she grabbed some clothes, packed them into a blue string backpack and said goodbye to her grandmother. Then she ran outside to the waiting car. Later that night, someone posted a short video of a party somewhere on the \u201crez\u201d. In it was Ashley, then aged 20, nestled on a couch, surrounded by people drinking beers and chatting. At one point, Ashley messaged her older sister Kimberly, who was in Morocco visiting her fiance. \u201cSend me some muns [money], can you,\u201d wrote Ashley. \u201cI wish I can sis but I\u2019m in Africa,\u201d Kimberly responded. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d \u201cAlways.\u201d Days passed. Kimberly, 25, had since returned to the US, but Ashley\u2019s phone wouldn\u2019t pick up. Kimberly didn\u2019t think too much of it; Ashley was always losing her mobile. And anyway, the sisters \u2013 who had grown up together wrangling horses, chopping wood and shoveling snow \u2013 had a plan. After months of living on the ranch and attending community college in the reservation\u2019s down-and-out capital, Browning, Ashley would finally be joining her sister in Missoula, a bohemian university town where they would share an apartment and start a new life together. But a week went by without a word from Ashley. By mid-June, when their father was suddenly hospitalised for liver failure, Kimberly panicked. Where was her sister? She made some phone calls. That was when she discovered that no one had seen Ashley since the night of the party. * * * There is no single database that tracks the number of Native women who go missing or are murdered every year. But FBI figures show that Native Americans disappear at twice the per capita rate of white Americans \u2013 despite comprising a far smaller population. Last year, after more than two dozen Native Americans, most of them women, went missing in Montana alone, state senator Jon Tester declared the number of missing and murdered Indigenous women (MMIW) across America an \u201cepidemic\u201d and vowed to find solutions. \u201cPeople ask me: \u2018Why are these women going missing? Is it the cartels?\u2019\u201d says cartographer Annita Lucchesi, a Southern Cheyenne descendant who is building the first ever US- and Canada-wide database devoted solely to missing and murdered indigenous women. \u201cIt\u2019s not the cartels \u2013 although that does happen \u2013 it\u2019s the devaluation of Native women.\u201d Lucchesi points to the harrowing rates of sexual assault, murder and domestic violence suffered by Native women \u2013 some of the highest in America \u2013 as evidence. More than 84% will experience violence at some point in their lifetime, according to a 2016 National Institute of Justice report. One in three will be raped (compared to one in five white women), and 96% of all sexual violence suffered by Native women will be committed by non-Native men. In some counties, the murder rate of Native women is 10 times higher than for any other race in America, according to the Department of Justice. Yet arrests and prosecutions are notoriously low, whether crimes against Native women are committed on the reservations or off them, says Lucchesi. \u201cI know people imagine this is something that happens mostly in Montana or North Dakota, but the thing I want to stress to people is that it happens everywhere. Some of the [places] that have the highest numbers [of MMIW] are actually liberal cities like Seattle, Portland and Denver,\u201d she says. \u201c[When] you don\u2019t see law enforcement holding up people who are accountable for hurting Native women, it becomes this culture where the only way anybody can ever see us is as victims and easy targets.\u201d * * * When the Loring family reported Ashley missing to the Blackfeet reservation\u2019s tribal police force, which, along with federal agents from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) serves as law enforcement to the sovereign nation, they were stunned by the response. \u201cNo one took it seriously,\u201d says Kimberly, shaking her head. \u201cThey just said: \u2018She\u2019s of age, she can leave when she wants to.\u2019 When we talk to other families whose girls went missing, they say that\u2019s what they got from law enforcement, too. It\u2019s not a proper response.\u201d The reservation\u2013 a vast 1.5m-acre expanse larger than Delaware, bordering the Rocky Mountains to the west and Canada to the north \u2013 was usually flooded with gossip. But all had gone quiet after Ashley\u2019s disappearance. Then, in late June, the first lead came in \u2013 two weeks after Ashley was last seen. A young woman had been spotted running from a vehicle on a desolate stretch of Route 89, flanked on either side by swamp, dense forest and the occasional trailer. A three-day search party was organised by tribal police and the BIA, but came up empty. Volunteers found a grey sweater believed to be Ashley\u2019s in a nearby dump, says Kimberly, but authorities misplaced it before they were able to do any testing. It would then take authorities two full months to launch a proper investigation into Ashley\u2019s case, by which point the lead investigator had started a relationship with, and was leaking information to, a prime suspect, Kimberly claims. \u201cIt was ridiculous. One of the [tribal] officers actually apologised to me. He said he was sorry about my sister and that he was working overtime on the case, but that nobody was taking it seriously,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople in Browning know exactly what happened to my sister and where she\u2019s at, but they\u2019re not speaking up because law enforcement ruined her case.\u201d Faced with the seeming indifference of the authorities, Kimberly took matters into her own hands, becoming her sister\u2019s de-facto detective. She trekked up and down the mountains looking for clues, calling Ashley\u2019s name, scrambling into rocky ravines, digging up fresh mounds of earth, analysing bones, chasing off grizzly bears. She followed every lead \u2013 many of them infuriatingly vague and horribly gruesome \u2013 and took every phone call, read every message, met anyone on the street who wanted to talk. She searched with friends, family, pet dogs and the occasional wildlife ranger \u2013 but often she was alone, armed with little more than bear spray and Camel Menthols. \u201cWhen a person goes missing, there isn\u2019t a book that will tell you: \u2018You need to do this and do that.\u2019 You have to just learn it on your own,\u201d sighs Kimberly. \u201cEvery day is a nightmare. We don\u2019t know what really happened to her. There\u2019s rumours about her being hurt and her body put places, being all cut up and scattered on the mountain.\u201d She squeezes her eyes shut to stop the tears. \u201cThat\u2019s why I search for her. That\u2019s why I go out in the mountains and look. I don\u2019t want my baby sister laying out there alone.\u201d It\u2019s a concern that Matthew Lone Bear, an enrolled member of the Three Affiliated Tribes, knows well. His own sister Olivia, a 32-year-old mother of five, went out for a drink and game of bingo one night in October 2017 on the Fort Berthold reservation in North Dakota, then disappeared \u2013 along with the Chevy Silverado she had been driving. \u201cThere was no big ol\u2019 conspiracy. Everything was fine with her. Nothing was out of the ordinary,\u201d he says. \u201cBut tribal PD [police department] were terrible,\u201d he says. Instead of searching for her, \u201cthey just kept hoping she\u2019d come home. They never had answers for us.\u201d Like Kimberly, Lone Bear quickly realised he would have to step in where he believed the authorities were lacking. He moved back onto the reservation and set up a headquarters stocked with snacks and water bottles, mapped out the surrounding areas using land surveys, enlisted locals to man search parties, and set up an anonymous tipline and fundraising page. When a donor finally purchased the DJI Phantom 3 drone on the search group\u2019s Amazon wishlist, Lone Bear taught himself the basics and found his search strategy changed entirely. \u201cI thought we could cover a lot more ground with a drone,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe Fort Berthold reservation is just shy of a million acres. And we got badlands, flats, farmland, a lot of private land, tribal land, army corps land \u2026 and it\u2019s right in the middle of the Bakken [oil reserve], so that\u2019s a lotta land to cover.\u201d He clasps his hands together as he looks out, recalling the memory. \u201cLaw enforcement was tellin\u2019 us we gotta hold hands and walk across a field [to search]. If you\u2019re gonna deal with a million acres, there\u2019s no dang way \u2013 you\u2019re gonna be sittin\u2019 there for the next 10 years!\u201d Lone Bear was meticulous in his approach to looking for Olivia. After creating a timeline of her last known movements, he logged every tip received \u2013 nearly 400 of them \u2013 and recorded every drone and foot search. Perhaps most crucially of all, he also drew up frequent press releases to keep Olivia\u2019s case ever-present in the news. \u201cI spent a lot of time looking at these [missing persons] cases, and there are so many times where law enforcement really doesn\u2019t investigate: they spend more time trying to make excuses why not to [search] than actually just getting out there and getting it done,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you look across the United States at all the different reservations, even off reservation, when Native people are missing, they don\u2019t get the same resources, and they don\u2019t get the same type of [press] coverage, when white people are missing.\u201d * * * Ten months after she was reported missing, Olivia\u2019s body was found submerged in the Chevy Silverado at the bottom of a lake less than a mile from her house. In the end, it was a volunteer search team using sonar \u2013 not tribal, state or federal authorities \u2013 that were credited with finding her body. The FBI is currently investigating the case. But the anguish and rage Lone Bear feels at not knowing what exactly happened to his sister have fuelled his desire to change the system. He is now drafting a missing person protocol that would help tribal governments \u201ccut out the red tape\u201d and streamline their approach so that \u201cif a family calls for resources and resources ain\u2019t comin\u2019 in \u2026 some kind of emergency procedure\u201d gets triggered, he says. At the top of his to-do list was helping the Loring family. For three days in late September, he flew the Phantom 3 over Route 89 and other key search areas, looking into leads Kimberly had recently received, including one about an alleged beaver dam where Ashley\u2019s body may have been laid to rest. Lone Bear leaned against his Ford Explorer and toggled the drone down a steep ravine towards a creek. From above, the reservation was awash with colour and texture. There were the vast expanses of charred, blackened hills, the result of recent forest fires; narrow ribbons of road zigzagging towards the mountain tops; swamps glittering in the sunshine; tall Douglas firs, straight as soldiers; and long grasses flattened by sleeping bears. As I joined Kimberly in searching on foot in the thick of it all, the drone buzzing high overhead, it became apparent that off every tiny trail, over every deserted rocky mountain path, lay evidence of not just human activity, but human detritus. Vodka bottles, beer cans, car keys, cigarette stubs, golf tees, stained T-shirts, clean shorts and smashed glass littered the earth. Everywhere, it seemed, was a party spot \u2013 and every party spot was a dumping ground. \u201cThere\u2019s party spots all over the reservation, a lot of \u2019em in the woods, in the mountains, out in the prairies,\u201d states Blackfeet reservation police officer Isaiah Webber matter of factly, a thick wad of chewing tobacco jutting his lower jaw forward. \u201cThese kids, they grow up and they see their parents drinking a lot, partying, they see domestic violence in their home, and they\u2019re left with that choice: \u2018Well, my mom\u2019s drinking, she\u2019s too hungover to take me to school, so I\u2019m just gonna drink, too.\u2019\u201d Webber, an enrolled member of the tribe who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, is just one of 18 officers covering the reservation, an area so huge that by the time police have been alerted to a crime, the perpetrator has many times already fled the scene. Unemployment on the reservation hovers around 40%. Most of the force\u2019s call-outs are alcohol-related, but meth and opioid use have also spiked recently, inflating both petty and violent crimes from break-ins to stabbings. \u201cWe are undermanned,\u201d Webber admits. \u201cEven if you have a full shift of five officers, you still have to cover the whole reservation, all one and a half million acres. This is the most officers that Browning\u2019s ever had, and we\u2019re barely keeping up.\u201d Webber appears chagrined over Ashley\u2019s disappearance. He logged multiple hours on the case, he says, following through on vague leads, many of them from self-proclaimed clairvoyants that ultimately led nowhere. One day, he found himself digging nearly 6ft into the ground after finding a fresh mound of earth obscured beneath a bridge. \u201cIt looked like it could\u2019ve been a body,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it was just a fire pit someone had covered up.\u201d The Blackfeet people\u2019s turbulent and often violent history at the hands of government authorities means that many locals are reluctant to come forward with any information \u2013 for fear that they will be somehow punished or get into trouble themselves, says Tana Fleury of the Blackfeet Domestic Violence Center. Fleury cites just a few US-government practices over the years that have instilled distrust: the forced placement of Native children in boarding schools (some parents who refused were imprisoned on Alcatraz); the forced sterilisation of Native women in the 1970s; the overrepresentation of Native children in foster care; and the disproportionately high incarceration rates of Native men and women across America (four times higher than white men, and six times higher than white women, respectively). The result is that families lie low and mind their own business, says Fleury. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get involved. We don\u2019t want to report it. It has everything to do with that historical trauma and seeing the police as [wielding] authority over us.\u201d Having failed to make any arrests regarding Ashley\u2019s case, Webber knows that the tribal police department may be judged as having failed both the Loring family as well as the reservation. \u201cIt\u2019s tough for the family to get closure,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s tough for the community, because they place their faith in us to bring people to justice, to uphold the law, to investigate these things. But the people who have seen her or the people who gave us information don\u2019t want to talk; they don\u2019t want to get themselves or whoever did it in trouble.\u201d He shrugs his shoulders and clasps his hands over his gun belt. \u201cIf someone won\u2019t talk, they won\u2019t talk, and it just becomes another cold case, another dead end, another statistic on this reservation.\u201d * * * \u201cFeisty\u201d is the word friends and family use most to describe Ashley, a tiny, buoyant brunette standing at 5\u20192\u201d (157cm) and weighing just 90lbs (41kg), but someone who knew how to stand up for herself. \u201cShe is strong \u2013 spiritually, emotionally, mentally, physically,\u201d says Ashley\u2019s best friend from childhood Erica Denney, 22, so upset by her disappearance that she mixes the present and past tenses to describe her. \u201cShe\u2019d stick up for people. If someone was getting bullied or if she saw something that was wrong, she would come out and tell you. \u201cThat\u2019s why never in a million years would you think [it would be] Ashley. All of a sudden she\u2019s just missing. She didn\u2019t even get to see her 21st birthday \u2026 She had plans. She had goals. And someone took that from her.\u201d The lack of answers is driving Ashley\u2019s family mad, says her father Roy Lee Heavyrunner, 47, a former firefighter who was in the hospital when she disappeared. \u201cI used to just sit at the window and stare and scream,\u201d he drawls, his speech slurring from a heavy cocktail of pain medications. \u201cI fear she suffered something painful. Agonising. Horrible. My little girl.\u201d He gazes out toward the battered houses lining his street, some of them boarded up with \u201cMeth Unit\u201d scrawled across in spray paint. Whoever had a hand in her disappearance is likely still on the reservation, he says, perhaps \u201csomeone I see every day\u201d. In December, Kimberly was invited by Montana senators Jon Tester, a Democrat, and Steve Daines, a Republican, to speak about Ashley\u2019s case at a US Senate committee on the \u201csilent crisis\u201d of missing and murdered women in Indian country, a legal term referring to reservations and other Native lands where tribal and federal laws apply, but state laws do not. In Montana alone, Native women make up just 3% of the state population, but comprise 30% of all missing persons. Kimberly delineated the many ways in which she believed tribal and federal authorities had failed to perform their duties in regards to Ashley\u2019s case. \u201cI am asking you to recognize that Indigenous women matter, and the way our missing and murdered women cases are handled needs to be corrected,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will no longer be the invisible people in the United States of America.\u201d In Canada, where Native women comprise just 4% of the total population but nearly 16% of all female homicide victims, a national inquiry was launched in 2016 after police racism was determined to have likely caused severe underreporting of MMIW cases. Its findings are due later this year. Speaking at the December hearing, Tester demanded an American reckoning. \u201cWhere\u2019s the problem?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs it with the BIA? Is it with the FBI? Is it with tribal law enforcement? Why are we not finding these people? We have got to find a solution to this.\u201d Tester has since introduced a bill requiring a federal investigation of each law enforcement agency\u2019s jurisdiction over MMIW, as well as helped to reintroduce Savanna\u2019s Act, a federal bill which would improve data collection related to MMIW cases as well as streamline communication between authorities. The bill \u2013 named after Savanna Lafontaine-Greywind, 22, an enrolled member of the Spirit Lake tribe who was eight months pregnant when she was murdered and had her baby cut from her womb by a white neighbour \u2013 nearly passed last year but was blocked at the last minute by a single member of Congress. Along with the recent election of two Native women to Congress \u2013 in addition to the introduction of legislation aimed at addressing MMIW in at least seven states, among them Montana and North Dakota \u2013 some change may finally be afoot. But activists have also pointed to a 40-year-old legal loophole as a target for reform. The 1978 US supreme court decision Oliphant v Suquamish ruled that tribes cannot arrest or prosecute non-Natives who commit crimes on Native land. In practice, this means that tribal police can arrest a Native man if he assaults a Native woman, but if that Native woman is assaulted by a non-Native, only a federal agent has authority. US attorneys then decide if they want to prosecute; but the latest figures show that federal prosecutors declined nearly half (46%) of all Indian country cases in 2016, many of them sexual assault cases. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem and incredibly complicated,\u201d says Cherokee lawyer Mary Kathryn Nagle, who specialises in tribal sovereignty. \u201cThe US Congress and supreme court have created a legal framework that even attorneys with years of education and fieldwork can have disagreements over [in regards to] who has jurisdiction.\u201d In one well-known case, Nagle says, after a non-Native man tried to shoot his Native ex-wife (but shot her co-worker instead), six different authorities argued over whose jurisdiction the case fell under \u2013 and in the end resorted to using a tape measure and map to resolve it. \u201cWe need the right to prosecute \u2013 we had it before and it\u2019s been taken away from us,\u201d says Nagle. \u201cIt\u2019s well known that tribal governments can\u2019t prosecute. And these men who want to commit crimes see this opportunity and seize it.\u201d Former North Dakota senator Heidi Heitkamp, who initially introduced Savanna\u2019s Act to Congress, likens this jurisdictional black hole to a hunt in which non-Native men are the hunters and Native women the targets. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have prosecutions, you have no deterrents,\u201d Heitkamp said at the December hearing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s open season on people who live in Indian country.\u201d For now, Kimberly is happy that positive action is on the horizon. The visit to Washington allowed Ashley\u2019s case to be properly heard for the first time since her sister went missing, she says. After a number of leads took investigators off the reservation and into other states, the FBI took over the case. And remarkably, the grey sweater she believes belonged to Ashley and was initially mislaid by authorities has also been found and is now being tested in a lab, she adds. In a recent post on Facebook \u2013 where Kimberly often shares photos of her sister as well as the missing poster offering a $10,000 reward \u2013 Kimberly described the day in November 1996 when Ashley was born. \u201cI remember walking up to a bed with pink blankets and my mom saying: \u2018Come meet your baby sister, Ashley.\u2019 I looked at her, and at that moment I knew I would always love her. I knew I had to protect her and I would always stand up for her,\u201d wrote Kimberly. \u201cMy bond with my sister is so strong, no one can break it. My love for my Ashley has no limit that it allows me to stand up and never give up looking for her. I know if I was in her shoes, she would be fighting just as hard if not harder. She would be standing up demanding answers. My sister is a beautiful, intelligent young woman [who] has goals and dreams. Being a missing and murdered Indigenous woman was not one of them.\u201d",

In parachute-light silk, no corsetry required, she looked airily relaxed on the red carpet, one hand in her pocket. This being pink\u2019s night meant a high profile for the house of Schiaparelli, whose founder Elsa invented \u201cshocking pink\u201d as a fashion colour. Schiaparelli, now helmed by designer Bertrand Guyon, dressed actors Linda Cardellini and Helen Mirren. Cardellini wore a headturner of cascading Shocking ruffles, cinched in a giant bow.

Gender roles have shifted a little, finally, at the Oscars. (In that respect, the night\u2019s key quote came from Olivia Colman, collecting her Oscar, womanfully fighting back tears, pointing to her husband and saying \u201che\u2019s going to cry \u2013 I\u2019m not\u201d.) Frances McDormand, who is at least seven million times too cool for predictable cookie-cutter red carpet choices, wore a pink gown from the same Valentino collection as Chan\u2019s to present the best actress Oscar to Colman, and teamed it with Birkenstocks. Maya Rudolph also wore Valentino pink, accessorised with the Paddington Bear hard-stare she has perfected for the red carpet. Angela Bassett, in Reem Acra with the sugar hit of a Quality Street fudge, and Kiki Layne, in ballet-slipper Versace, both wore their pink long and sculptural.

      "bodyText": "In the pi\u00f1ata that is Oscars night, it\u2019s not till the party gets started that you find out what is truly happening. When things get wild is when it all comes tumbling out. This feels particularly true if you watch the ceremony on UK time, when the juicy stuff happens well after any sensible Sunday-night bedtime. The film that isn\u2019t supposed to be win best picture winning best picture. Gaga and Cooper turning their Shallow performance into a steamy serenade. Billy Porter debuting the gown-cedo (tux from the waist up, dress from the waist down). Lady Gaga\u2019s 128.54 carat Tiffany diamond. Melissa McCarthy spoofing The Favourite in a dalmation cape covered with stuffed bunnies. Linda Cardellini. This year, Oscar fashion happened in a glitter shower of pink, a confetti explosion of fuschia froth. Pink dominated early proceedings on the red carpet \u2013 and thanks to Julia Roberts\u2019 presenting gig, it closed the night too. But there was nothing bashful or blushing about this pink. It was not Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s sobbing-in-Ralph Lauren, prom-queen pink. This was the pink of Villanelle, the tulle-wearing psychopath from Killing Eve. It was the pink of Nancy Pelosi, presiding over last month\u2019s group portrait of Democratic committee chairmen in a raspberry trouser suit. Nancy Pelosi holds the gavel; Jodie Comer as Villanelle in Killing Eve. Gemma Chan looked epic in a high-necked Valentino gown that she wore just as it was shown on the Paris haute couture catwalk last month, with an off-centre part and a neat up-do. In parachute-light silk, no corsetry required, she looked airily relaxed on the red carpet, one hand in her pocket. This being pink\u2019s night meant a high profile for the house of Schiaparelli, whose founder Elsa invented \u201cshocking pink\u201d as a fashion colour. Schiaparelli, now helmed by designer Bertrand Guyon, dressed actors Linda Cardellini and Helen Mirren. Cardellini wore a headturner of cascading Shocking ruffles, cinched in a giant bow. Mirren\u2019s gown, multi-toned layers of subtly different sunset shades, was a love poem to pink. Helen Mirren arrives in a multi-toned pink gown; Julia Roberts presents the Best Picture award. This is not pink for princesses but pink for queens \u2013 in the modern, sassy, Rihanna sense of the word. Gender roles have shifted a little, finally, at the Oscars. (In that respect, the night\u2019s key quote came from Olivia Colman, collecting her Oscar, womanfully fighting back tears, pointing to her husband and saying \u201che\u2019s going to cry \u2013 I\u2019m not\u201d.) Frances McDormand, who is at least seven million times too cool for predictable cookie-cutter red carpet choices, wore a pink gown from the same Valentino collection as Chan\u2019s to present the best actress Oscar to Colman, and teamed it with Birkenstocks. Maya Rudolph also wore Valentino pink, accessorised with the Paddington Bear hard-stare she has perfected for the red carpet. Angela Bassett, in Reem Acra with the sugar hit of a Quality Street fudge, and Kiki Layne, in ballet-slipper Versace, both wore their pink long and sculptural. The new generation of pink tulle dresses have a precise, almost spiky silhouette. If you were to get too close to Kacey Musgraves in Giambattista Valli, the fanned edges look like they might give you a paper cut. Clockwise from top left: Maya Rudolph, Angela Bassett, KiKi Layne and Kacey Musgraves. The Oscars are about glamour, not fashion.

But more people are enslaved today than at any other time in history. Experts have calculated that roughly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jul/31/human-life-is-more-expendable-why-slavery-has-never-made-more-money\">13 million people were captured and sold as slaves between the 15th and 19th centuries</a>; today, an estimated 40.3 million people \u2013 more than three times the figure during the transatlantic slave trade \u2013 are living in some form of modern slavery, <a href=\"https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/2018/findings/global-findings/\">according to the latest figures</a> published by the UN\u2019s International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Walk Free Foundation.</p> <p>Women and girls comprise 71% of all modern slavery victims. Children make up 25% and account for 10 million of all the slaves worldwide.</p> <h2><strong>What are the slaves being forced to do?</strong></h2> <p>A person today is considered enslaved if they are forced to work against their will; are owned or controlled by an exploiter or \u201cemployer\u201d; have limited freedom of movement; or are dehumanised, treated as a commodity or bought and sold as property, <a href=\"https://www.antislavery.org/slavery-today/modern-slavery/\">according to abolitionist group Anti-Slavery International</a>.</p> <p>Globally, more than half of the 40.3 million victims (24.9 million) are in <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/forced-labour/definition/lang--en/index.htm\">forced labour</a>, which means they are working against their will and under threat, intimidation or coercion.

Forced marriage is most prevalent in Africa. But there isn\u2019t a single country that isn\u2019t tainted by slavery: 1.5 million victims are living in developed countries, with an estimated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/29/13000-slaves-uk-four-times-higher-previously-thought\">13,000 enslaved here in the UK</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Why are there so many slaves today?</strong></h2> <p>Slavery is big business. Globally, <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/forced-labour/statistics/lang--en/index.htm\">slavery generates as much as $150bn (\u00a3116bn) in profits every year,</a> more than one third of which ($46.9bn) is generated in developed countries, including the EU. Whereas slave traders two centuries ago were forced to contend with costly journeys and high mortality rates, modern exploiters have lower overheads thanks to huge advances in technology and transportation. Modern migration flows also mean that a large supply of vulnerable, exploitable people can be tapped into for global supply chains in the agriculture, beauty, fashion and sex industries.</p> <p>According to slavery expert Siddharth Kara, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jul/31/human-life-is-more-expendable-why-slavery-has-never-made-more-money\">modern slave traders now earn up to 30 times more</a> than their 18th and 19th century counterparts would have done. The one-off cost of a slave today is $450, Kara estimates. A forced labourer generates roughly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/13/global-economy-untainted-slavery-can-happen\">$8,000 in annual profit</a> for their exploiter, while sex traffickers earn an average of $36,000 per victim.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d583dfd66e7e3ae888764acbe2002a6d2717c43f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d583dfd66e7e3ae888764acbe2002a6d2717c43f/0_194_5992_3597/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe, 10, and Kwame, 12, who were sold by their mother to a fisherman in Ghana\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe, 10, and Kwame, 12, who were sold by their mother to a fisherman in Ghana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lonnie Schlein/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt turns out that slavery today is more profitable than I could have imagined,\u201d Kara said. \u201cProfits on a per-slave basis can range from a few thousand dollars to a few hundred thousand dollars a year, with total annual slavery profits estimated to be as high as $150bn.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s important to acknowledge that global population rates also affect estimates: the top 10 countries with the highest estimated absolute number of victims are also some of the most populous. Together, these 10 countries \u2013 China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Indonesia, Iran, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, the Philippines and Russia \u2013 comprise 60% of all the people living in modern slavery, as well as more than half the world\u2019s population, according to the Global Slavery Index.</p> <p>An increase in violent conflict worldwide over the past 30 years has also inflated the number of people at risk of slavery, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), with armed groups and terrorists turning to trafficking \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jan/08/trafficking-convictions-fall-25-despite-rising-number-of-victims-in-europe\">to show they have control over the community, or to increase their force</a>, either recruiting child soldiers or giving sex slaves as a reward for their recruitment\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/briefing-boxes/slavery2/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Box 1\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/briefing-boxes/slavery2/embed.html\">Box 1</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>What\u2019s the difference between slavery and human trafficking?</strong></h2> <p>Human trafficking is just one way of enslaving someone. Whereas centuries ago it was common for a slave trader to simply buy another human being and \u201cown\u201d that person as their property (which does still happen), today the practice is largely more insidious.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/what-is-human-trafficking.html\">Trafficking</a> involves the recruitment, transfer or obtaining of an individual through coercion, abduction, fraud or force to exploit them.

      "bodyText": "How many slaves are there today, and who are they? The word \u201cslavery\u201d conjures up images of shackles and transatlantic ships \u2013 depictions that seem relegated firmly to the past. But more people are enslaved today than at any other time in history. Experts have calculated that roughly 13 million people were captured and sold as slaves between the 15th and 19th centuries; today, an estimated 40.3 million people \u2013 more than three times the figure during the transatlantic slave trade \u2013 are living in some form of modern slavery, according to the latest figures published by the UN\u2019s International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Walk Free Foundation. Women and girls comprise 71% of all modern slavery victims. Children make up 25% and account for 10 million of all the slaves worldwide. What are the slaves being forced to do? A person today is considered enslaved if they are forced to work against their will; are owned or controlled by an exploiter or \u201cemployer\u201d; have limited freedom of movement; or are dehumanised, treated as a commodity or bought and sold as property, according to abolitionist group Anti-Slavery International. Globally, more than half of the 40.3 million victims (24.9 million) are in forced labour, which means they are working against their will and under threat, intimidation or coercion. An additional 15.4 million people are estimated to be living in forced marriages. Of the 24.9 million people trapped in forced labour, the majority (16 million) work in the private sector. Slaves clean houses and flats; produce the clothes we wear; pick the fruit and vegetables we eat; trawl the seas for the shrimp on our restaurant plates; dig for the minerals used in our smartphones, makeup and electric cars; and work on construction jobs building infrastructure for the 2022 Qatar World Cup. Another 4.8 million people working in forced labour are estimated to be sexually exploited, while roughly 4.1 million people are in state-sanctioned forced labour, which includes governmental abuse of military conscription and forced construction or agricultural work. In certain countries such as Mauritania, people are born into \u201chereditary\u201d slavery if their mother was a slave. Again, women and girls bear the brunt of these statistics, comprising 99% of all victims in the commercial sex industry, and 58% in other sectors, according to the ILO. Where is this happening? Statistically, modern slavery is most prevalent in Africa, followed by Asia and the Pacific, according to the Global Slavery Index, which publishes country-by-country rankings on modern slavery figures and government responses to tackle the issues. But the ILO and Walk Free warn that these figures are likely skewed due to lack of data from key regions. \u201cWe believe that the global estimate of 40.3 million is the most reliable data to date, although we believe it to be a conservative estimate as there were millions of people we couldn\u2019t reach in conflict zones or on the refugee trail and places where we couldn\u2019t be sure of collecting robust data such as the Gulf states, where access and language barriers prevented us from reaching the migrant worker communities,\u201d said Micha\u00eblle de Cock, a senior statistician at the ILO. More than 70% of the 4.8 million sex exploitation victims are in the Asia and Pacific region. Forced marriage is most prevalent in Africa. But there isn\u2019t a single country that isn\u2019t tainted by slavery: 1.5 million victims are living in developed countries, with an estimated 13,000 enslaved here in the UK. Why are there so many slaves today? Slavery is big business. Globally, slavery generates as much as $150bn (\u00a3116bn) in profits every year, more than one third of which ($46.9bn) is generated in developed countries, including the EU. Whereas slave traders two centuries ago were forced to contend with costly journeys and high mortality rates, modern exploiters have lower overheads thanks to huge advances in technology and transportation. Modern migration flows also mean that a large supply of vulnerable, exploitable people can be tapped into for global supply chains in the agriculture, beauty, fashion and sex industries. According to slavery expert Siddharth Kara, modern slave traders now earn up to 30 times more than their 18th and 19th century counterparts would have done. The one-off cost of a slave today is $450, Kara estimates. A forced labourer generates roughly $8,000 in annual profit for their exploiter, while sex traffickers earn an average of $36,000 per victim. \u201cIt turns out that slavery today is more profitable than I could have imagined,\u201d Kara said. \u201cProfits on a per-slave basis can range from a few thousand dollars to a few hundred thousand dollars a year, with total annual slavery profits estimated to be as high as $150bn.\u201d It\u2019s important to acknowledge that global population rates also affect estimates: the top 10 countries with the highest estimated absolute number of victims are also some of the most populous. Together, these 10 countries \u2013 China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Indonesia, Iran, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, the Philippines and Russia \u2013 comprise 60% of all the people living in modern slavery, as well as more than half the world\u2019s population, according to the Global Slavery Index. An increase in violent conflict worldwide over the past 30 years has also inflated the number of people at risk of slavery, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), with armed groups and terrorists turning to trafficking \u201cto show they have control over the community, or to increase their force, either recruiting child soldiers or giving sex slaves as a reward for their recruitment\u201d. What\u2019s the difference between slavery and human trafficking? Human trafficking is just one way of enslaving someone. Whereas centuries ago it was common for a slave trader to simply buy another human being and \u201cown\u201d that person as their property (which does still happen), today the practice is largely more insidious. Trafficking involves the recruitment, transfer or obtaining of an individual through coercion, abduction, fraud or force to exploit them. That exploitation can range from forced labour to forced marriage or commercial sex work \u2013 and the exploiter can be anyone, including strangers, neighbours or family members. Most people are trafficked within their own countries, although they can also be trafficked abroad; most often the individual is trafficked into forced labour. Many times, the victim is led to believe they have been offered a well-paid job in a different city or country, only to find the job does not exist and they are now indebted to their \u201cemployer\u201d or trafficker and must pay transportation, lodging and any other \u201cfees\u201d the exploiter demands, thereby forcing the victim into debt bondage. For example? Guardian investigations have revealed a slew of abuses from Qatar to Thailand, India to the United States. Qatar was forced to take action after revelations of abusive practices foisted on migrant workers helping build its infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup. Trafficking on to fishing boats is still widespread, particularly in south-east and east Asia, where men are lured by the promise of jobs in agriculture or construction, then drugged or beaten and wake up at sea. Exploitation of migrant workers has also been revealed in Malaysia, Cambodia, China, Italy, Vietnam and the UK. How does someone end up becoming a slave? There is no definitive answer to this question. Modern slavery affects people of every colour, age and gender \u2013 but is more prevalent among vulnerable people. That might be a Cambodian villager looking for a better paid job in a neighbouring country, only to find himself trafficked on to a fishing boat. Or a young girl forced to marry at 13 because climate change has flooded her family\u2019s crops and they can no longer afford to keep her at home. Or a homeless person kidnapped from a London soup kitchen and forced to work on a caravan site. Or a migrant whose visa has expired and can be threatened with deportation if she doesn\u2019t do what the trafficker demands. Slavery is global but flourishes in places where the rule of law is weak and corruption goes unchecked, says Anti-Slavery International. Will slavery ever end? Activists such as Kara believe that slavery can be eradicated for good, but that it would take great political will and considerable research. First, dedicated investigators would need to identify each level in the often murky supply chains of commodities in order to determine where labour abuses are taking place. Then, independent certification processes would need to be designed for each commodity, so that consumers could make educated choices about the products they are buying and the slavery or labour abuses implicated with those purchases. Finally, Kara says, industries would need to invest in the communities whose low-cost labour is being used to make the products. \u201cDoing so would help mitigate vulnerability to being trafficked and exploited,\u201d Kara said. \u201cConsumers may have to pay slightly more for certain goods, and multinational corporations may have to accept slightly lower profits. But a freer and fairer labour environment would promote greater productivity, potentially offsetting some of those expenses.\u201d What do I do if I think someone is a victim of modern slavery? According to Anti-Slavery International, slavery is so common that it is possible you come across victims \u201con a regular basis\u201d. Key things to look out for are whether the person has freedom of movement; appears scared, withdrawn or shows signs of abuse; has few personal belongings or identifying documents with them; or seems under the control of someone else and scared to talk. If you think someone may tick these boxes, it is best to contact authorities directly instead of approaching the person, as approaching them could put them in danger.

      "bodyText": "Spike Lee savours the moment \u201cDo not turn the motherfucking clock on\u201d said Spike Lee \u2013 flouting the organisers\u2019 90-second time limit to talk about how it is 400 years since \u201cour ancestors were stolen from Mother Africa and bought to Jamestown, Virginia, enslaved\u201d. He spoke of how his grandmother became \u201ca Spelman College graduate even though her mother was a slave\u201d and saved \u201c50 years of social security checks to put her first grandchild \u2013 she called me Spikie-poo \u2013 through Morehouse College and NYU grad film.\u201d Lee also paid tribute to his friend Prince by wearing a purple suit and a specially made necklace in the shape of the symbol that the singer used as his identity. Prince can be heard singing Mary Don\u2019t You Weep over the credits of BlacKkKlansman, a film that ends with footage from the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. On the red carpet before the ceremony, Lee said his nomination as best director was overdue. Although he didn\u2019t secure the award, his joy was clear to see, leaping into the arms of Samuel L Jackson, who was presenting him with his award for best adapted screenplay. Lee\u2019s speech finished with a rallying cry: \u201cThe 2020 presidential election is around the corner. Let\u2019s all mobilise. Let\u2019s all be on the right side of history. Make the moral choice between love versus hate.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s do the right thing!\u201d he added, in a reference to his 30-year-old breakthrough movie. \u201cYou know I had to get that in there.\u201d New ground for African American women It was 2015 when April Reign tweeted the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite and it first gained traction on social media \u2013 and since then the Academy has made some attempts to address the diversity within its nominations. With Black Panther picking up awards this time around, the 2019 Oscars saw African Americans who work behind the scenes picking up awards for the first time in decades. Ruth E Carter became the first African American woman to win for costume design, saying: \u201cWow, this has been a long time coming.\u201d She went on to say: \u201cMarvel may have made the first black superhero, but through costume design we turned him into an African king.\u201d Her colleague Hannah Beachler went on to make history as the first African American woman to win for production design. After praising people who worked on the film with her and her family for giving her strength, she concluded: \u201cI give this strength to all of those who come next to keep going and to never give up, and when you think it\u2019s impossible just remember this piece of advice I got from a very wise woman: I did my best, and my best is good enough.\u201d A sprinkling of politics Without a single host, plenty of people used their brief time on stage to make political points. Immigration was a recurring theme, with best actor winner Rami Malek proudly stating that he was a first-generation American. Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, the Mexican film-maker who won best director for Roma, said: \u201cI want to thank the Academy for recognising a film centred around an indigenous woman, one of the 70 million domestic workers in the world without work rights.

Green Book\u2019s win stirs controversy Green Book was a surprise winner, and not universally popular. While it tackles race issues in the US, it has been criticised for employing a \u201cwhite saviour\u201d narrative in the way it depicts the relationship between Don Shirley and Tony Vallelonga, the portrayal of which has also been disputed by Shirley\u2019s family.

      "bodyText": "Federal Labor MPs have been given new legal advice arguing there is a valid pathway to revoke the environmental approvals for the controversial Adani coal project, and a summary of polling showing stopping the project would not necessarily cost seats in central Queensland. Guardian Australia has seen a brief for Labor MPs prepared by the Stop Adani campaign, which quotes legal advice from Neil Williams SC, a specialist in environmental and planning law, arguing \u201cthere is evidence to support revocation of Adani\u2019s approval under section 145 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, including significant impacts on water resources that were not assessed when the mine was approved\u201d. The legal advice, according to the brief circulated to MPs and members of the shadow cabinet, says the environment minister could revoke the approval on the grounds that there is new information about significant negative impacts from the mine \u2013 namely the impacts on water, and on the habitat of the black\u2011throated finch. It contends that pathway could allow a revocation of Adani\u2019s approvals without triggering compensation risks. That opinion builds on legal advice the Australian Conservation Foundation shared with Bill Shorten early last year. The ACF opinion argues that the commonwealth environment minister has discretion to revoke the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act approval for Adani \u201con at least two grounds\u201d. The first ground would be \u201cnew information of the consecutive bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, indicating increased sensitivity to greenhouse gas emissions\u201d and the second would be \u201cnew information of the insufficiency of offsets for the endangered black-throated finch, indicating a threat to the continued survival of the species from the Carmichael project\u201d. The brief from the Stop Adani campaign also refers to polling in three central Queensland seats: Capricornia, Herbert and Dawson. It claims the polling shows that 60\u201170% of residents support action on Adani on water grounds. It says polling of 800\u2011900 voters in the three seats undertaken last October pointed to \u201cstrong support\u201d for reviewing the environmental approvals for the mine. \u201cThe results also show that a large number of minor party voters are supportive of action, including those who intend to vote for the Katter Australia Party and One Nation.\u201d Adani has flared again as a political issue for Labor because key unions have made public interventions over the past week arguing that the project should be supported by the Queensland Labor government \u2013 interventions that have been leapt on by Coalition frontbenchers who see an opportunity to bolster the Morrison government\u2019s political position in central Queensland in the coming election. While the government is blasting Labor from a pro-coal, pro-jobs position, Labor is also under sustained pressure from the environment movement, the Greens and progressive activist groups to toughen its stance against a project which has become a proxy for action on climate change in the national political debate. The brief to Labor MPs from the Stop Adani campaign says the group is looking for a commitment that \u201cif elected, we will review the federal environmental approval and if the evidence supports it, we will not hesitate to revoke it\u201d. Over the weekend, Labor\u2019s environment spokesman, Tony Burke, said he was not in a position to make any commitment about future action Labor might take because if the decision was reviewed, he was potentially the decision maker. Burke told the ABC on Sunday he had always been sceptical about whether the law has been followed in relation to previous environmental approvals for the Adani project, but he argued he could not telegraph a firm disposition about what he might do about the approvals in the future without making a prejudgment that could render any subsequent decision unlawful. In explaining his stance, Burke referred to a long-running saga in the 2000s in which a Liberal environment minister had to overturn his own decision to block a $220m windfarm project to save orange-bellied parrots after a federal court appeal. Shorten signalled publicly, and privately to environmental activists at the start of 2018, that federal Labor was looking to toughen its position against the controversial project, but the Labor leader ultimately pulled back from that shift largely due to internal concerns about the political fallout in central Queensland.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Q</strong> Three of my brothers owned a house together, which they recently sold. Two of the brothers put \u00a375,000 each into the house and the third brother, who has not lived in the property for 10 years contributed \u00a33,000 towards the purchase of the house. There was no mortgage on the property.</p> <p>They had no deed of trust. We would like to know what is the legal way of splitting the profit from the house. The house sold for \u00a3490,000.<br><strong>GS</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Given the unequal contributions that your three brothers made to the purchase price of their house, it was severely remiss of the solicitor who did the conveyancing not to discuss drawing up a deed of trust. A deed of trust is a legal document which spells out who owns what percentage share of the equity and can also be used to spell out what should happen if one joint owner wants to sell up. </p> <p>In the absence of a deed of trust, when a property is sold the law assumes an equal split of the sale proceeds between joint owners. But making that assumption wouldn\u2019t be very fair on your two brothers who each put in \u00a375,000. They can\u2019t draw up a deed of trust retrospectively but they can \u2013 with your other brother\u2019s agreement \u2013 split the \u00a3490,000 they got for the house according to the percentage share they initially contributed. </p> <p>So assuming that the house originally cost \u00a3153,000 (two times \u00a375,000 plus \u00a33,000), the brothers who contributed \u00a375,000 should each get 49% of the sale proceeds leaving your other brother with a 2% share. These percentage shares would also apply to the amounts used to calculate any capital gains tax bill which may be due to the brothers who didn\u2019t live in the house.</p> <p><strong>Muddled about mortgages?

      "bodyText": "Q Three of my brothers owned a house together, which they recently sold. Two of the brothers put \u00a375,000 each into the house and the third brother, who has not lived in the property for 10 years contributed \u00a33,000 towards the purchase of the house. There was no mortgage on the property. They had no deed of trust. We would like to know what is the legal way of splitting the profit from the house. The house sold for \u00a3490,000. GS A Given the unequal contributions that your three brothers made to the purchase price of their house, it was severely remiss of the solicitor who did the conveyancing not to discuss drawing up a deed of trust. A deed of trust is a legal document which spells out who owns what percentage share of the equity and can also be used to spell out what should happen if one joint owner wants to sell up. In the absence of a deed of trust, when a property is sold the law assumes an equal split of the sale proceeds between joint owners. But making that assumption wouldn\u2019t be very fair on your two brothers who each put in \u00a375,000. They can\u2019t draw up a deed of trust retrospectively but they can \u2013 with your other brother\u2019s agreement \u2013 split the \u00a3490,000 they got for the house according to the percentage share they initially contributed. So assuming that the house originally cost \u00a3153,000 (two times \u00a375,000 plus \u00a33,000), the brothers who contributed \u00a375,000 should each get 49% of the sale proceeds leaving your other brother with a 2% share. These percentage shares would also apply to the amounts used to calculate any capital gains tax bill which may be due to the brothers who didn\u2019t live in the house. Muddled about mortgages?

While working in areas where there have been previous landslides, he says he has discovered dead bodies and buried them. Testimonies heard by the Guardian reveal a deadly environment where lethal landslides and equipment failures strike regularly, in an industry with a history of human rights abuses, corruption and environmental destruction. \u201cAt first it was so scary for me,\u201d says another worker. \u201cBut it\u2019s becoming natural \u2026 We started accepting that we could die in any situation.\u201d Conditions in the country\u2019s jade trade \u2013 estimated to be worth more than $30bn (\u00a323bn) a year \u2013 are notoriously treacherous for the estimated 300,000 migrant labourers at the Hpakant mines, claiming scores of lives every year. Yet Myanmar\u2019s parliament has passed a controversial bill governing the gemstone sector, paving the way to restart the licensing of mining companies after a two-year moratorium. The industry has fuelled a brutal, decades-long civil war in Kachin state, but in 2016 hopes of reform had been raised when Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government stopped issuing new gemstone permits until sustainable environment plans were put in place. Optimism was further heightened by proposals to create a fresh nationwide policy in line with global standards under the extractive industries transparency initiative. Civil society groups have been stunned by the government\u2019s decision to develop and implement a gemstone law separately from the policy, failing to adopt key parts of the latter that were widely praised by experts. \u201cThere\u2019s been basically no attempt by parliament to involve itself or align its law with the policy,\u201d says Paul Donowitz, Myanmar campaign leader for Global Witness, who published a landmark report into the jade industry in 2015. \u201cWe have concerns about the process and that is amplified by the very powerful interests involved in the sector, whether they be military cronies or Chinese businesses.\u201d Maw Htun Aung, Myanmar country manager for the Natural Resource Governance Institute, says: \u201cWe are concerned that the government will use the new gemstone law as a justification to restart the issuing of mining licences to companies without addressing the root cause of the problem that had led to the moratorium.\u201d The law does not include the policy\u2019s recommendation that beneficial ownership \u2013 whereby the owners of companies are made public \u2013 should be implemented, or that the behaviour of companies with a track record of human rights abuses, environmental damage and corrupt practice should be taken into account when issuing mining permits. Nor does the law factor in plans to curb illegal mining by companies \u2013 a growing problem \u2013 or tackle conflicts of interest within the Myanmar Gems Enterprise, which acts as both a regulator issuing licences and a business controlling lucrative mines through joint ventures with numerous companies. In what appears to be an attempt to reduce the industrial-scale operations that have amassed over the past decade, the law limits the length of permits and size of mining block areas. But policymakers have said that, despite good intentions, this measure will not provide enough space or time to practise environmentally friendly work. \u201cMining sites should be 50 or 100 acres, but the law just allows three or five acres,\u201d says Mung Dan of the Myanmar Alliance for Transparency and Accountability, which was involved in the drafting of the separate policy. \u201cThis won\u2019t be environmentally sustainable.\u201d Myanmar produces about 70% of the world\u2019s jade stone, with Global Witness valuing the market at $31bn a year.

Just $31m in sales was recorded at last year\u2019s Gems Emporium, which is supposed to be the official marketplace for all high quality jade in the country. Control over revenues at the Hpakant jade mines in Kachin, believed to be Myanmar\u2019s most valuable resource, have spurred an ongoing armed conflict between the Myanmar army and the Kachin Independence army, for nearly six decades. Another military group, the United Wa State army, also known as the Wa, has lucrative mining contracts that were given to them in 1994 in exchange for peace. \u201cThe jade trade and extraction is acting as a financial engine for the conflict in the area,\u201d says Therese Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, who carried out fieldwork in Kachin for international non-profit Swedwatch. \u201cLocals have told us that unless the regulations around jade ensure a more fair and transparent distribution, it\u2019s unlikely that peace negotiations will be successful.\u201d Many miners are unregistered labourers living in tarpaulin shelters, who increasingly come from all over Myanmar in the hope of finding a fortune. \u201cThere\u2019s large-scale environmental destruction, people have lost their land, [there\u2019s] a lack of jobs day by day, danger for miners around mining sites, and human rights violence by security guards, police and soldiers,\u201d says Steven Naw of the Kachin Development Networking Group. More than 100 miners were killed after a 60-metre high mountain of earth and waste collapsed in 2015. The mines are narrow and deep to maximise space, making them prone to landslides \u2013 particularly in the monsoon season, which is said to claim lives every day. Scores died in two separate incidents last year. Miners\u2019 testimonies reveal a destructive environment in the community around the mines, with endemic heroin addiction, high rates of HIV and the commercial sexual abuse of women and girls. One miner says heroin is sold \u201copenly, just like selling a movie ticket\u201d in Hpakant, and that a friend of his disappeared for years without a trace. \u201cOne day he came and found me.

      "body": "<p>Among the more amusing frauds of the energy company Enron was the time, in 1998, when it <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/1833221.stm\">decided to create an entire fake trading floor</a> at its Texas HQ \u2013 complete with TVs, computers, and shirtsleeved guys shouting down phones \u2013 to fool Wall Street analysts visiting for its annual general meeting.</p> <p>Now, however, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, appears to be aiming for something even more ambitious \u2013 an entire fake cycle network. I am in south-west London, in an alley about six feet wide, wedged between a railway line and the back garden fences of Southdown Road. According to Khan, this is the Wimbledon to Raynes Park Quietway, part of the 140km of cycle infrastructure, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/sep/21/sadiq-khan-says-hes-better-than-boris-on-cycling-but-do-his-claims-add-up\">he claims to have built since taking office</a>.</p> <p>There isn\u2019t room for two bikes to pass safely. The cracked, bumpy tarmac hasn\u2019t been touched in years. The crossing of the busy Lower Downs Road lacks even a dropped kerb and throws you blind into traffic emerging from a long, tunnel-like bridge under the railway. No work at all, not even new signposting, has been done here.</p> <p>Nearly three years into his term, stung by criticism that he has achieved almost nothing on cycling, Khan has upped the pace \u2013 not of construction, alas, but of publicity. Few weeks pass without the mayor or his staff hailing his terrific progress on all fronts. But when you dig into these claims, they are false.</p> <p>Khan and his social media accounts have repeatedly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LDN_gov/status/1009763635139350529\">claimed he has doubled cycling spend to \u00a3169m a year.</a> In December his walking and cycling commissioner, Will Norman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/dec/31/how-london-is-aiming-to-become-the-world-best-big-city-for-cycling\">said Khan was further increasing this to an average of \u00a3214m a year.</a> Spending in the last full year, 2017-18, <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/questions/2018/2981\">was in fact \u00a390m</a>. Spending in 2018-19 <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/questions/2018/5189\">is projected to be \u00a386m</a>. Even these amounts are puzzling, since outside three autonomous \u201cmini-Holland\u201d London boroughs, almost nothing meaningful has been delivered.</p> <p>Wimbledon to Raynes Park is one of more than 50 sections of Quietway backstreets route, totalling about 100km, which Khan claimed to <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/questions/2018/2977\">have built and to be complete</a> in a list he gave to the London Assembly in November. The term \u201cbuilt,\u201d he admitted, can mean as little as putting up signs \u2013 or, often, replacing old signs with new ones.</p> <p>Over the 10 weeks since the list was published, I\u2019ve ridden most of the sections of route which Khan claims to have built. In a few places, I found, new Quietway signs have indeed been painted on the road, though they are often <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sallypook/status/1065185392482287616\">hard to see under the queues of vans and rat-running cars</a>. The last thing many of these routes are is quiet.</p> <p>Elsewhere, I discovered that City Hall has taken decades-old traffic-free cycle routes, such as the Thames towpath and the Greenway in east London, put Quietway signs on them and claimed them as new routes. This alone accounts for 26km of the 100km that has supposedly been delivered. In other places, there were traces of work begun but not finished.</p> <p>At least a further 30km consists of little more than rebranding existing, unsegregated, noughties-era London Cycle Network (LCN) routes on sometimes busy and congested streets. Khan <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/15km-of-new-quietway-cycle-routes-opened\">claimed in a press release</a> that \u201cQuietways are leading to a big increase in cycling, with 24,000 bike journeys on Quietway 2 within its first week of opening.\u201d Most of Quietway 2, under its former name of LCN route 8, has in fact been open for more than 10 years, which explains why 24,000 journeys a week are made on it.</p> <p>But on very long stretches of the network claimed to be complete, and even by Khan\u2019s minimalist definition, I found nothing: neither new signage nor any trace of work starting. (<a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/questions/2018/5135\">Khan last month issued a revised Assembly answer</a>, still claiming that all the sections concerned had been constructed but admitting that wayfinding was still awaited on most of them.)</p> <p>The Quietway programme is a scandal. Khan <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/questions/2018/2979\">has spent at least \u00a346m on the Quietways since taking office</a>. That money has bought not a single meaningful route that did not already exist (the only proper new route, Quietway 1, was built under Khan\u2019s predecessor, Boris Johnson, for whom I was cycling commissioner) and very little else of any real value to cyclists.</p> <p>There is a useful, albeit part-time, new link at the Thames Barrier, which cuts out a long diversion.

      "bodyText": "Among the more amusing frauds of the energy company Enron was the time, in 1998, when it decided to create an entire fake trading floor at its Texas HQ \u2013 complete with TVs, computers, and shirtsleeved guys shouting down phones \u2013 to fool Wall Street analysts visiting for its annual general meeting. Now, however, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, appears to be aiming for something even more ambitious \u2013 an entire fake cycle network. I am in south-west London, in an alley about six feet wide, wedged between a railway line and the back garden fences of Southdown Road. According to Khan, this is the Wimbledon to Raynes Park Quietway, part of the 140km of cycle infrastructure, which he claims to have built since taking office. There isn\u2019t room for two bikes to pass safely. The cracked, bumpy tarmac hasn\u2019t been touched in years. The crossing of the busy Lower Downs Road lacks even a dropped kerb and throws you blind into traffic emerging from a long, tunnel-like bridge under the railway. No work at all, not even new signposting, has been done here. Nearly three years into his term, stung by criticism that he has achieved almost nothing on cycling, Khan has upped the pace \u2013 not of construction, alas, but of publicity. Few weeks pass without the mayor or his staff hailing his terrific progress on all fronts. But when you dig into these claims, they are false. Khan and his social media accounts have repeatedly claimed he has doubled cycling spend to \u00a3169m a year. In December his walking and cycling commissioner, Will Norman, said Khan was further increasing this to an average of \u00a3214m a year. Spending in the last full year, 2017-18, was in fact \u00a390m. Spending in 2018-19 is projected to be \u00a386m. Even these amounts are puzzling, since outside three autonomous \u201cmini-Holland\u201d London boroughs, almost nothing meaningful has been delivered. Wimbledon to Raynes Park is one of more than 50 sections of Quietway backstreets route, totalling about 100km, which Khan claimed to have built and to be complete in a list he gave to the London Assembly in November. The term \u201cbuilt,\u201d he admitted, can mean as little as putting up signs \u2013 or, often, replacing old signs with new ones. Over the 10 weeks since the list was published, I\u2019ve ridden most of the sections of route which Khan claims to have built. In a few places, I found, new Quietway signs have indeed been painted on the road, though they are often hard to see under the queues of vans and rat-running cars. The last thing many of these routes are is quiet. Elsewhere, I discovered that City Hall has taken decades-old traffic-free cycle routes, such as the Thames towpath and the Greenway in east London, put Quietway signs on them and claimed them as new routes. This alone accounts for 26km of the 100km that has supposedly been delivered. In other places, there were traces of work begun but not finished. At least a further 30km consists of little more than rebranding existing, unsegregated, noughties-era London Cycle Network (LCN) routes on sometimes busy and congested streets. Khan claimed in a press release that \u201cQuietways are leading to a big increase in cycling, with 24,000 bike journeys on Quietway 2 within its first week of opening.\u201d Most of Quietway 2, under its former name of LCN route 8, has in fact been open for more than 10 years, which explains why 24,000 journeys a week are made on it. But on very long stretches of the network claimed to be complete, and even by Khan\u2019s minimalist definition, I found nothing: neither new signage nor any trace of work starting. (Khan last month issued a revised Assembly answer, still claiming that all the sections concerned had been constructed but admitting that wayfinding was still awaited on most of them.) The Quietway programme is a scandal. Khan has spent at least \u00a346m on the Quietways since taking office. That money has bought not a single meaningful route that did not already exist (the only proper new route, Quietway 1, was built under Khan\u2019s predecessor, Boris Johnson, for whom I was cycling commissioner) and very little else of any real value to cyclists. There is a useful, albeit part-time, new link at the Thames Barrier, which cuts out a long diversion. There are several new road crossings, though often not very good ones \u2013 the sort that force you to cycle up on to the pavement, double back on yourself and weave around pedestrians. The Greenway and part of the River Wandle trail in Wandsworth have new lighting. In the borough of Southwark, three roads have been closed to through traffic. But across the whole of Greater London, that is more or less it. Nearly \u00a350m is an astonishing amount to pay for such meagre returns.

The three mini-Holland boroughs have done a further 14km or so of protected route \u2013 almost all of them schemes consulted on and agreed under Johnson and where building often also began before Sadiq took office. Khan pays for the mini-Hollands, but has no role in delivering them; all the hard work was done by the councils concerned.

Her father, who died last year, was one of the thousands of black people who found it much more difficult to cast their ballot after Alabama Republicans imposed new restrictions on ID cards that could be used to register to vote. \u201cThis was old tricks in new guises. Today as an African American in Alabama you don\u2019t have to count marbles in jars or recite the US constitution to get the vote, but has your polling station been closed, or has its location been changed without notifying you, or has it been moved so far away you can\u2019t get there because you don\u2019t have a car?\u201d Sewell has a warning for Republicans who are already gearing up to oppose her: be careful about undermining protections for minority voters, as one day soon the older white voters who form a growing proportion of American conservatives will themselves be the minority. \u201cI tell my Republican colleagues that the browning of America is coming, and that means the definition of who is a minority will change. Those very protections they are trying to restrict \u2013 they are going to need them.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 25 February 2019 to clarify that Brian Kemp beat Stacey Abrams in the race for Georgia governor. We erroneously said he ran for the US Senate.",

So when the <a href=\"https://www.shermantheatre.co.uk/performance/theatre/taming-shrew/\">Sherman theatre</a>\u2019s artistic director Rachel O\u2019Riordan approached her, she felt she had \u201cunfinished business\u201d.</p> <p>When she was first asked, she says, \u201cI was John Clifford, living as a man. Now I\u2019m Jo Clifford, living as a woman.\u201d It made sense to her for the characters in the play to go through a similar metamorphosis. Clifford\u2019s version flips the characters\u2019 genders and a forthcoming production at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/rsc\">RSC</a> similarly locates the play in a matriarchal society. In Clifford\u2019s version, Katherine is a man and Petruchio a woman in a world where male virtue is prized and women wield the power. \u201cAs a trans theatre-maker,\u201d she says, \u201cI understand that we need to rethink what it is to be a man, what it is to be a woman.\u201d Shakespeare was also writing at a period of incredible change between men and women, she continues, and \u201cpart of the gorgeousness of his work is that he celebrates that\u201d.</p> <p>Many of Shakespeare\u2019s plays explore the power dynamics between men and women but few do so as explicitly as The Taming of the Shrew.

This is a play of its time, of course, but also the one most concerned with how misogyny manifests itself. It remains one of his most performed plays, and lends itself to experimentation. Phyllida Lloyd cast Kathryn Hunter and Janet McTeer as Katherine and Petruchio in her all-female take at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe in 2003.

Ultimately, she has no control and \u201cthat lack of agency is obviously an unusual situation to play as a male actor.\u201d He explains that in the world of the play as imagined by Clifford and directed by Michael Fentiman, \u201cthe women are the powerbrokers, politicians and soldiers, so it\u2019s them who have the war-like bearing, and we are boys who are objects of beauty, used to being looked at and not in control\u201d.

That torsion is fun to play with.\u201d</p> <p>Clifford hopes that scenes, such as the one in which a mother auctions her sons off like property, will be shocking in a way that they perhaps wouldn\u2019t be if played in the conventional way. \u201cOur sensibilities have been dulled \u2013 these are things we don\u2019t think about because they\u2019re part of the ordinary mundane injustices of our lives.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1316735caa7a927c96630f6aa7619abae88c888\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1316735caa7a927c96630f6aa7619abae88c888/0_432_6484_3891/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claire Price and Joseph Arkley rehearse the RSC\u2019s Taming of the Shrew.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claire Price and Joseph Arkley rehearse the RSC\u2019s Taming of the Shrew.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Allard/RSC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Justin Audibert was offered the opportunity to direct the play by RSC artistic director Gregory Doran, he knew that he needed to find a new way into the text that addressed the way women were represented. \u201cI have to be aware of the privilege I carry as a man and as the director,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He was tired of sitting in rooms where men got the main share of the lines \u2013 this was a way to address this issue, too. \u201cI don\u2019t think the world needs to see any more imagery of men abusing women.

This carbon abatement occurs when an organisation takes some action to avoid or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. For instance, a waste company could capture and burn off the methane from its landfills, or a farmer might draw greenhouses gases from out of the atmosphere, by planting trees. At present 26 different methods of abating our emissions are at play under government contracts.</p> <p>The current funding allocated to the scheme is $2.55bn. About $2.33bn of that money has been allocated to projects already over the ERF\u2019s eight auctions. A little over $480 million has been paid to those running the projects so far.</p> <p>The government claims that the fund will provide 193 million tonnes of abatement between 2015 and 2028, an average of about 14 million tonnes per year. Those numbers may seem big, but that\u2019s about one third of the emissions per year from Australia\u2019s largest emitter, AGL.</p> <h2>Monday\u2019s announcement</h2> <p>Among a suite of measures announced by the government on Monday was a $2bn boost to the emissions reduction fund, as well as a rebrand. The climate solutions fund will use the same mechanism as the emissions reduction fund and will spend $200m per year over the next 10 years to offset our emissions.</p> <p>If that funding arrives, and the average price stays the same as recent auctions, that mechanism will deliver approximately 90 million tonnes of abatement in the next decade, with a further 60 million tonnes being delivered after 2030.</p> <p>That\u2019s a big if. While the government\u2019s headline figure is $2bn, at most only $600m of that will be delivered in the next term of government.</p> <h2>What\u2019s wrong with the emissions reduction fund?</h2> <p>Ignoring the fact that there are many better and more legitimate ways to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions than by direct investment from the government, the ERF fails on its own terms through a series of bespoke issues across the methods.</p> <p>These have been reported over the past four years and provided a picture of a deeply flawed scheme.</p> <p>For example, research <a href=\"https://www.mq.edu.au/about/about-the-university/faculties-and-departments/faculty-of-arts/departments-and-centres/macquarie-law-school/our-research/1-gilligan-and-baxter-ajel-2017.pdf\">published</a> by myself and a colleague at Melbourne Law School and reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/28/government-advisers-call-for-emissions-fund-to-end-investment-in-junk-credits\">in the Guardian</a> found that most projects contracted under the ERF\u2019s landfill gas method predate the scheme \u2013 some by more than a decade. The fund is supposed to drive new abatement. This is expressly in the goals of the scheme itself. The ERF provides little benefit to the environment by funding these old projects, and the funding is rapidly converted into shareholder dividends.</p> <p>The revegetation methods while generally robust will be dwarfed by land-clearing elsewhere in Australia. The ERF has secured commitments to deliver 111 million tonnes from revegetation projects across Australia over 2015-2028. Research out of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/native-forests-can-help-hit-emissions-targets-if-we-leave-them-alone-44849\">ANU estimates that</a> Australia\u2019s recent land-clearing rates have been releasing up to 38 million tonnes per year. We wouldn\u2019t need to invest this money at all if Australia could get its land-clearing under control.</p> <p>Another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/25/emissions-reduction-fund-to-pay-for-fossil-fuel-plant-that-would-be-built-anyway\">story on Monday</a> revealed that major polluters such as the Granny Smith Gold Mine are being paid by the ERF to switch out one form of fossil fuelled power for another. This is occurring even though the proponents themselves indicated that the funding played no role in their decision to upgrade. Again, this runs counter to the express goals of the fund, which is supposed to drive new emissions abatement opportunities, rather than subsidise project activity that may have occurred anyway.</p> <p>These problems have pervaded the ERF and will continue into the new climate solutions fund.</p> <h2>Australia has no need to go down this route</h2> <p>Australia is blessed with opportunity when it comes to dealing with climate change. We are the sunniest and windiest inhabited continent in the world, with ample opportunities to build our renewables as well as the necessary infrastructure to support them (such as batteries).</p> <p>We have incredible potential to reduce our emissions across the country, with analysis released last year from Reputex showing that even Labor\u2019s higher goal of -45% below 2005 levels by 2030 can be reduced on a cost negative basis.</p> <p>We need to do so much more than accounting tricks and the direct purchase of spurious abatement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2019/feb/25/if-the-coalition-has-had-a-climate-epiphany-im-beyonce\">If the Coalition has had a climate epiphany, I'm Beyonc\u00e9 | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The IPCC\u2019s special report on a 1.5-degree target, released last year made it clear that to have a moderately safe climate, things will be far easier if we start now. The precipitous declines in our emissions that will be needed if we wait until after 2030 are something that I struggle to believe possible.</p> <p>But if we start now, a relatively safe climate future is achievable. Despite the hyperbole thrown around in certain sectors of the media, and by certain politicians, it is not economy-wrecking, too hard, or not worth it.</p> <p>More importantly, it is entirely necessary. The world where we choose not to act to prevent the worst of climate change is not looking great.</p> <p>\u2022 Tim Baxter is an associate of the Australian-German Climate and Energy College and a fellow of Melbourne Law School</p>",

The revegetation methods while generally robust will be dwarfed by land-clearing elsewhere in Australia. The ERF has secured commitments to deliver 111 million tonnes from revegetation projects across Australia over 2015-2028. Research out of ANU estimates that Australia\u2019s recent land-clearing rates have been releasing up to 38 million tonnes per year. We wouldn\u2019t need to invest this money at all if Australia could get its land-clearing under control. Another story on Monday revealed that major polluters such as the Granny Smith Gold Mine are being paid by the ERF to switch out one form of fossil fuelled power for another. This is occurring even though the proponents themselves indicated that the funding played no role in their decision to upgrade. Again, this runs counter to the express goals of the fund, which is supposed to drive new emissions abatement opportunities, rather than subsidise project activity that may have occurred anyway. These problems have pervaded the ERF and will continue into the new climate solutions fund. Australia has no need to go down this route Australia is blessed with opportunity when it comes to dealing with climate change. We are the sunniest and windiest inhabited continent in the world, with ample opportunities to build our renewables as well as the necessary infrastructure to support them (such as batteries). We have incredible potential to reduce our emissions across the country, with analysis released last year from Reputex showing that even Labor\u2019s higher goal of -45% below 2005 levels by 2030 can be reduced on a cost negative basis. We need to do so much more than accounting tricks and the direct purchase of spurious abatement. The IPCC\u2019s special report on a 1.5-degree target, released last year made it clear that to have a moderately safe climate, things will be far easier if we start now. The precipitous declines in our emissions that will be needed if we wait until after 2030 are something that I struggle to believe possible. But if we start now, a relatively safe climate future is achievable. Despite the hyperbole thrown around in certain sectors of the media, and by certain politicians, it is not economy-wrecking, too hard, or not worth it. More importantly, it is entirely necessary. The world where we choose not to act to prevent the worst of climate change is not looking great. \u2022 Tim Baxter is an associate of the Australian-German Climate and Energy College and a fellow of Melbourne Law School",

      "bodyText": "The archbishop of Brisbane, Mark Coleridge, is under investigation for his treatment of a woman who offered information on child abuse within the Catholic church more than a decade ago. Last week Coleridge attended a four-day meeting at the Vatican on child protection where he spoke in damning terms about the church\u2019s handling of child sexual abuse allegations. The complaint against Coleridge relates to a 2006 meeting with a Canberra woman who had offered information about child sexual abuse within his then archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn. It is alleged he called the woman a \u201cgossip\u201d and acted aggressively towards her. Coleridge strongly rejects the allegation. It is understood the investigation is almost complete. In a statement, the archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn confirmed it was investigating the matter, but said its progress had been delayed because the woman \u201cchose not to engage with the process\u201d. The archdiocese of Sydney and the archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn were made aware of the matter several months ago. \u201cDiscussions between the two archdioceses led to agreement that Canberra and Goulburn would establish an independent investigation of the allegations,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cArchbishop Mark Coleridge cooperated with the investigation and strongly refuted the allegations. When [the complainant] was invited to cooperate with the independent investigation, she chose not to engage with the process. \u201cShe has instead chosen to take these allegations to the media, which is deeply disappointing.\u201d Guardian Australia has seen documents confirming the church has engaged a consultant, Kate Halloran, to examine the matter. The announcement of Coleridge\u2019s trip to the Vatican prompted the woman, who has informed Guardian Australia she does not wish to be named, to write to the archbishop on 20 December 2018, urging him not to go. Coleridge delivered a closing sermon during Sunday morning mass at the conference. He labelled the church\u2019s care of survivors \u201cweak\u201d and urged clergy to \u201clisten to survivors, but not just listen \u2013 to walk with them\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m talking very practical ways of accompanying all those who have been abused in whatever way they need to be accompanied,\u201d he said. Coleridge later told reporters there was no place in the church for abusers. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear now ... that anyone in the Catholic church in any part of the world who thinks that he or she can get away with sexual abuse of the young and vulnerable, has absolutely nowhere to go,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "In the end, there was enough good news \u2013 or news that made a certain sort of sense \u2013 for this not to be simply another exasperating Academy Awards pageant of mysteriously over-promoted nonsense. Olivia Colman already had the title of queen of all our hearts, and, just when it looked as if Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s The Favourite was going to go home with nothing at all, Colman added the Academy Award to her bulging silverware cabinet \u2013 and of course gave a speech of great charm and grace. Her prize acceptance game this year has been off the chart: stylish, polished and with just enough pinch-me-I\u2019m-dreaming astonishment to rival Helen Mirren\u2019s triumphal awards season tour of 2007, when she was winning everything for her own queenly performance. Colman (Anne), Mirren (Elizabeth II), Dench (Elizabeth I) \u2026 Brits in crowns generally do it for the Academy. And there was justice in seeing Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n picking up the best director, best cinematography and best foreign language Oscars for his magnificent artwork Roma. I have no problem with Spike Lee and his co-writers David Rabinowitz, Charlie Wachtel and Kevin Willmott picking up the award for best adapted screenplay for their fierce satire BlacKkKlansman. (Although I think I might have preferred to see Nicole Holofcener and Jeff Whitty get it for Can You Ever Forgive Me?) The 2019 Oscar prize list was speckled with honourable wins. But best picture for Green Book? (Best original screenplay, too, over The Favourite and Paul Schrader\u2019s First Reformed.) The news of that win lands like a dead weight on Oscar night, increasing the inevitable disappointment and tristesse that settles on any awards ceremony in its closing minutes, as the unacknowledged frustration of the losers\u2019 80% silent majority seeps into the atmosphere. A friend of mine said that by the time this awards season was over, this film should have the word \u201cREALLY?\u201d added to its title. Green Book REALLY? becomes this year\u2019s technical winner of the \u201cbest picture\u201d accolade and surely now is added to the list that includes Crash, Chicago and Argo in the What Were They Thinking? categories. Green Book isn\u2019t a bad film, and it is possible to overindulge one\u2019s high cinephile disdain. Mahershala Ali (winner for best supporting actor) and Viggo Mortensen give very slick and technically accomplished performances as the African-American jazz musician and composer Don Shirley and Tony Vallelonga, the Italian-American nightclub bouncer who finds himself driving Shirley through a tricky tour of the 1960s deep south.

As with Green Book, it feels as if the Academy has reached into the bargain bin just by the till, and capriciously plucked out a couple of also-rans for glory.

Walk into the open courtyard to discover book stalls, chess players, street musicians and, on summer Sunday evenings, tango dancing. There are eight permanent <em>bouquinistes</em>, booksellers who since 1982 display thousands of rare tomes, cinema posters, prints and maps, plus <em>bandes d\u00e9ssin\u00e9es</em>, comics from vintage English-language Marvel and DC to Tintin and Mickey Mouse. We may be in the age of Kindle but in Lille, print culture is alive and well. Afterwards, enjoy a <em>chocolat chaud</em> and signature <em>gau</em><em>fre</em><em> </em>pastry at Meert\u2019s 17th-century tearoom and p\u00e2tisserie. </p> <h2><strong>Club night</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7906459157b066413558683b4643bd9c9797e83c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7906459157b066413558683b4643bd9c9797e83c/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Le Magazine Club, Lille, France\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Open Friday and Saturday nights only, <strong>Magazine Club</strong> is the prime after-hours rendezvous in Lille. It resembles a concrete bunker, but only houses 800 people, so when it is packed and dancing, it feels very intimate. Music is house and techno, recreating the vibe of 1980s Belgian electro clubs. DJs are mostly French, with guest exceptions like Detroit\u2019s Jeff Mills and Terry Francis from London. Regulars are already queueing when doors open at midnight, and the place gets going seriously after 2am, shutting around 6.30am. Prices are reasonable: entry \u20ac10-15, drinks from \u20ac4.<br>\u2022 <em>84 rue de Tr\u00e9vise, on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Le-Magazine-Club/187085404767080?nr\" title=\"\">Facebook</a></em></p> <h2>Go to market</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"df097e2b51daf82ecb1abccdbc1acfbc29f86110\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df097e2b51daf82ecb1abccdbc1acfbc29f86110/0_50_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bread stall in Wazemmes covered market\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For a slice of local life, try the Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday morning market in the old industrial neighbourhood of <strong>Wazemmes</strong>.

Around the packed square, cafes, stalls and trucks sell goods of all kinds plus an irresistible mix of world cuisine. Inside the historic covered food hall (Tue-Sun from 8am), Lillois specialities such as pungent maroilles cheese and jars of <em>potjevleesch</em>, a delicious terrine of veal, rabbit, chicken and pork, are on display.

Apart from giant skeletons of elephants and whales, there are thousands of stuffed animals and birds, strange living insect installations and a geological wing with scary dinosaurs. During the Lille 3000 festival, it will host a show on Mexican folk art. Right outside is Parc Jean-Baptiste Lebas, perfect for a picnic in summer. The park is a typical example of how Lille has changed, as this green space with modern sculptures and flower gardens used to be an ugly car park. <br>\u2022 <em>19 rue de Bruxelles, <a href=\"http://mhn.lille.fr/\" title=\"\">mhn.lille.fr</a> , adult \u20ac3.70, 12-25s \u20ac2.60, under-12s free</em></p> <h2><strong>Young designers</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c22b2822a14bb30788724ccf71ba5b46a86f6a15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c22b2822a14bb30788724ccf71ba5b46a86f6a15/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MAISONS DE MODE, Lille, France\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Roubaix is a 20-minute Metro ride from central Lille, home to <a href=\"https://www.roubaix-lapiscine.com/\" title=\"\">La Piscine</a>, a resplendent art deco municipal swimming pool converted into a museum and exhibition venue.

      "bodyText": "Book browsing Smack in the middle of Lille\u2019s main square, La Vieille Bourse is its former stock exchange, probably the most beautiful building in the city, dating from 1652. Walk into the open courtyard to discover book stalls, chess players, street musicians and, on summer Sunday evenings, tango dancing. There are eight permanent bouquinistes, booksellers who since 1982 display thousands of rare tomes, cinema posters, prints and maps, plus bandes d\u00e9ssin\u00e9es, comics from vintage English-language Marvel and DC to Tintin and Mickey Mouse. We may be in the age of Kindle but in Lille, print culture is alive and well. Afterwards, enjoy a chocolat chaud and signature gaufre pastry at Meert\u2019s 17th-century tearoom and p\u00e2tisserie. Club night Open Friday and Saturday nights only, Magazine Club is the prime after-hours rendezvous in Lille. It resembles a concrete bunker, but only houses 800 people, so when it is packed and dancing, it feels very intimate. Music is house and techno, recreating the vibe of 1980s Belgian electro clubs. DJs are mostly French, with guest exceptions like Detroit\u2019s Jeff Mills and Terry Francis from London. Regulars are already queueing when doors open at midnight, and the place gets going seriously after 2am, shutting around 6.30am. Prices are reasonable: entry \u20ac10-15, drinks from \u20ac4. \u2022 84 rue de Tr\u00e9vise, on Facebook Go to market For a slice of local life, try the Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday morning market in the old industrial neighbourhood of Wazemmes. We say here that this is the land of 100 nationalities, from Portuguese and Italians who worked in mines and textile factories, to present-day migrants from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, Albania and Moldavia, Iraq and Afghanistan. Around the packed square, cafes, stalls and trucks sell goods of all kinds plus an irresistible mix of world cuisine. Inside the historic covered food hall (Tue-Sun from 8am), Lillois specialities such as pungent maroilles cheese and jars of potjevleesch, a delicious terrine of veal, rabbit, chicken and pork, are on display. At Le Cheval Blanc on rue des Sarrasins, Madame Monique hosts a heaving bal populaire with live music. Animal magic The Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Histoire Naturelle is perfect for family visits away from the crowds. Housed in a grand 1822 building, it is one of France\u2019s most important natural history museums. Apart from giant skeletons of elephants and whales, there are thousands of stuffed animals and birds, strange living insect installations and a geological wing with scary dinosaurs. During the Lille 3000 festival, it will host a show on Mexican folk art. Right outside is Parc Jean-Baptiste Lebas, perfect for a picnic in summer. The park is a typical example of how Lille has changed, as this green space with modern sculptures and flower gardens used to be an ugly car park. \u2022 19 rue de Bruxelles, mhn.lille.fr , adult \u20ac3.70, 12-25s \u20ac2.60, under-12s free Young designers Roubaix is a 20-minute Metro ride from central Lille, home to La Piscine, a resplendent art deco municipal swimming pool converted into a museum and exhibition venue. But fashion lovers should pop next door, to the brilliant Vestiaire, a textile factory converted into a showroom for emerging fashion designers. Incubator Maisons de Mode runs eight pop-up boutiques inside, helping young designers make a start. Vestiaire has a health food diner, but across the road is L\u2019Etoile de Damas, whose owner, a Syrian refugee, and has become a local favourite, ringing his mum at home for great family recipes. \u2022 27 rue de l\u2019Esp\u00e9rance, Roubaix, maisonsdemode.com Lille\u2019s eat street Once a quiet backstreet, rue des Bouchers has become Lille\u2019s new foodie rendezvous, with half a dozen new bistrots popping up in the past year. Latest is Le Petit Bougnat specialising in Auvergne cheeses and charcuterie (from \u20ac5), while next door the more fashionable Ripaille (two-courses from \u20ac19) serves dishes such as cockles with chorizo and saffron. Book for Bloempot , a Flemish canteen whose \u20ac25 three-course lunch, including beer or wine, is the best deal in town.

      "bodyText": "Top story: night of surprises at the Oscars This is Alison Rourke bringing you the first Guardian morning briefing of the week. Even with a Bafta and Golden Globe under her belt, Olivia Colman couldn\u2019t hide her shock overnight at winning the Academy award for best actress for her lead role in the Favourite. In a characteristically off-the-cuff acceptance speech, Colman said she wanted to \u201cthanks lots of people\u201d and that if she forgot anyone she would find them later and give them \u201ca massive snog\u201d. Colman said how shocked she was to be there, having once worked as a cleaner. She also thanked Glenn Close, who was widely tipped as the likely best actress winner, saying she had been \u201cher idol for so long; this is not how I wanted it to be\u201d. She thanked her parents, her longstanding agent, her new publicists, and her three children, who she hoped were watching at home \u201cbecause this isn\u2019t going to happen again\u201d, raising the loudest laugh from the audience. But Colman\u2019s gong was the only one the much-heralded film took home, out of ten nominations. The biggest surprise of the night came when Green Book won best picture. The feel-good comedy drama, starring Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortenson, attracted controversy during the awards season, when some people questioned the veracity of its supposedly true story about the friendship between pianist Don Shirley and his chauffeur Tony Lip. Roma, a tale of domestic workers in 1970s Mexico City, was also nominated for 10 awards. It won best director for Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, best foreign film and best cinematography. Another highlight was Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019s Rami Malek taking out best actor. He thanked Queen and reminded the audience that Freddie Mercury was a gay man of immigrant parents. The film also won best editing, best sound editing, and best sound mixing. But a performance by Queen, fronted by former American Idol contestant Adam Lambert, received a mixed reception. It was no surprise to anyone that Shallow won the Oscar for best original song. Lady Gaga delivered an emotional speech about working hard for what you believe in. A short time earlier she and co-star, Bradley Cooper, stole the show, performing the song live. BlacKkKlansman won best adapted screenplay, best production design and best costume design. In accepting the screenplay award, Spike Lee was effusive, honouring his grandmother who saved to put him through college. \u201cMy grandmother who saved 50 years of social security cheques to put her first grandchild \u2013 she called me Spiky Poo \u2013 through \u2026 college and NYU grad film. NYU!\u201d You can see all the red-carpet action here, including a sea of pink dresses and one dinner-suit ballgown, and all the smooches, shocks and funny moments during the ceremony here. A full list of winners is here. * * * Brexit vote delay \u2013 Theresa May has dug in on her decision to delay the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on a revised withdrawal deal, and dismissed pressure to step down as prime minister after Brexit. Sunday saw a fierce backlash against the PM, who admitted the vote would not be held before 12 March. She assured people it was \u201cstill within our grasp\u201d to leave the EU on 29 March, but Keir Starmer, Labour\u2019s Brexit chief, said delaying the vote was \u201cthe height of irresponsibility\u201d and an \u201cadmission of failure\u201d. Meanwhile EU sources have reported Brexit could be delayed until 2021 under plans being explored by senior European officials. * * * Cue diplomacy \u2013 There was a rare moment of distraction for Theresa May when she was challenged to a game of pool by the Italian PM, Guiseppe Conte, at the EU-Arab League summit in Egypt. Conte posted a video on his Facebook page of May being offered a cue and joking that she would be \u201chopeless\u201d. In the footage, chief of staff Gavin Barwell shows May how to position her hand on the table while striking the cue ball, although the footage ends before she takes a shot. Retweeting the video, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, joked: \u201cPleased to see nothing\u2019s been taken off the table.\u201d * * * Homeless crisis \u2013 Councils in England have been accused of deliberately hiding the scale of rough sleeping by changing the way their figures were compiled in 2018. Official statistics reported a 2% drop in England after seven years of consecutive rises. But analysis by the Guardian found that more than 30 councils switched from submitting an estimate \u2013 akin to a local census, where agencies work with rough sleepers all year round to get a number \u2013 to a one-night street count with some councils reporting reductions in rough sleeping of up to 85%. * * * Memo of misunderstanding \u2013 A public disagreement between Donald Trump and one of his top trade negotiators left a gobsmacked room of US-China trade officials. In the Oval Office, in front of Beijing\u2019s top negotiator and the Chinese delegation, Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative, contradicted the president\u2019s claim that memoranda of understanding (MOU) are non-binding. \u201cI don\u2019t like MOUs because they don\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Trump had said. But Lighthizer, who was brought into the White House team because of his anti-China credentials, immediately jumped in to differ: \u201cAn MOU is a contract, it\u2019s the way trade agreements are generally used.\u201d Ouch. * * * \u2018There\u2019s a lot to catch up on\u2019 \u2013 Lessons on sexting, female genital mutilation and how to recognise anxiety in your friends will be part of new guidelines being unveiled by the Department of Education for schools in England. Children as young as four will be taught about relationships, staying safe online and the link between physical and mental health. The long-awaited package of proposed changes to relationship and sex education are the first since 2000. \u201cAlmost 20 years on from the last time guidance on sex education was updated, there is a lot to catch up on,\u201d said the education secretary, Damian Hinds. * * * Chinese cyber threats \u2013 The UK must be \u201calert to the threat from Chinese tech firms\u201d according to Jeremy Fleming, the director of GCHQ. In a speech in Singapore, he said the government\u2019s monitoring agency would \u201cneed to pioneer a new form of security for the cyber age\u201d to ensure that Britain develops more resilient telecommunications networks. His comments come against a background of international concern about the reliance on the Chinese technology giant Huawei for the future rollout of superfast 5G phone networks in western economies.

      "body": "<p>In April 2015, Lee Ridley wrote an email to his parents and sister. \u201cHi family, I\u2019m just emailing you all to let you know that I plan to hand my notice in at the council in the next week or so,\u201d he began. That\u2019s Sunderland council, where Ridley worked.</p> <p>It hadn\u2019t been an easy decision, and he knew his family would worry about him: Ridley was giving up a good job with a salary, security and pension for a career with none of those things. But he\u2019d been struggling to do both, hadn\u2019t been doing either well, and it hadn\u2019t been good for his health.</p> <p>Mostly, though, he felt he had reached a crossroads. If he didn\u2019t follow his dream, he would regret it for the rest of his life. \u201cI hope you all at least understand my reasoning,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI owe everything I have achieved so far to all of you. When it comes down to it, I just want to do the best that I can and make you proud of me. Love you lots, Lee xxx.\u201d</p> <p>Ridley was quitting the council for comedy \u2013 writing and performing, which he does under the stage name <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/07/lost-voice-guy-review-lee-ridley-britains-got-talent-edinburgh-gilded-balloon\" title=\"\">Lost Voice Guy</a>.

And the winner of Britain\u2019s Got Talent 2018 (not to mention \u00a3250,000) is \u2026 Lost Voice Guy.</p> <p>Next stop, last December, was the London Palladium for the Royal Variety Show, another packed house. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and millions watching at home. The decision to quit the council wasn\u2019t looking like such a bad one.</p> <p>What has he done with the money, I ask him. I\u2019m interviewing him in the upstairs bar area of the Stand comedy club in central Newcastle, where he has performed many times. He arrived in a taxi from the north of the city, where he lives on his own. A carer comes in a couple of times a day to help out with stuff.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve still got most of it, but I treated my family and friends to a few things, and I\u2019ve bought a few things myself,\u201d he says. \u201cMy biggest purchase has been my MacBook, and I\u2019m taking my family on holiday this year.\u201d</p> <p>They\u2019re going to Yorkshire. Yorkshire? That\u2019s only down the road. \u201cBecause my niece is still young. We haven\u2019t had a family holiday since I was about 17.\u201d Ridley is now 38.</p> <p>So he didn\u2019t buy a new voice, less robotic, with more realistic intonation and the stress on the right words? There must be better ones now. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to blag that one but it\u2019s pretty expensive, trying to play the disability card and get it cheap.\u201d But, he says, this one makes his material funnier. \u201cI\u2019m so used to this voice now, it\u2019s almost part of me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"caa1375c5a6b83f0b303fda439d0cb672fa62416\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caa1375c5a6b83f0b303fda439d0cb672fa62416/0_652_3348_2009/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lost Voice Guy wins Britain\u2019s Got Talent last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m usually a lot darker and I enjoy that more \u2026\u2019 <br>Lost Voice Guy wins Britain\u2019s Got Talent last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dymond/Thames/Syco/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I quickly get used to it.

Ridley went to a Ross Noble gig where the comedian did a Stephen Hawking impression. Later, at the stage door, Ridley challenged Noble to a Hawking-off \u2013 who could do the best impression. It got him thinking about things: jokes, comedy, those kinds of things.</p> <p>Ridley is a fan of Noble, for his quick wit and randomness. And of The League of Gentlemen for their darkness.

I never started to do standup comedy to change people\u2019s attitudes or anything, it was just because I enjoyed it.\u201d</p> <p>Ridley\u2019s last Edinburgh show was about that. \u201cIt was called Inspirational Porn because that\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s the rest of society getting off on seeing disabled people achieve something and making themselves feel good. We seem to be putting disabled people into two groups, the super crips and the feeble crips. And that\u2019s a dangerous game to play, because it suggests to the rest of society that some disabled people aren\u2019t as worthy of attention and support as others.\u201d</p> <p>He is very much including the government in this. \u201cOur government has a very weird relationship with disabled people. We are either seen as superhuman or as some sort of burden. We are encouraged to go out and do our best to succeed, on the one hand, while the other hand takes away the ability for us to live independently at all.\u201d</p> <p>I should say that we didn\u2019t cover all this ground in 90 minutes or so in the Stand Club. Some of it he has already written, for my pre-cooked questions, then just pressed the button. And we had a couple of email exchanges afterwards. Our time together was over ridiculously quickly.</p> <p>We did manage to talk about football (he supports the Magpies, in spite of being from the wrong side of the Tyne). And relationships: he\u2019s not in one at the moment. \u201cI always seem to fuck them up. I have a habit of overthinking and worry about things for no reason, for example I always worry what people think about my disability and I worry if I\u2019m good enough for them.\u201d</p> <p>Haven\u2019t there been loads of offers now that he is rich and famous? \u201cNot from anyone sane.\u201d</p> <p>The iPad is interesting. A page of labelled squares, \u201cIntros\u201d, \u201csaw me on BGT\u201d \u2026 and they all lead to other pages and other squares: \u201cJay-Z\u201d, \u201cdisabled card\u201d, \u201cgovernment hunger games\u201d. Ridley can steer his show, navigating through about five hours of material.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t it frustrating, not being able to be more spontaneous? \u201cIt\u2019s really annoying at times when I think of something onstage but can\u2019t really do anything about it, but the worst is when I\u2019m out with my mates and think of something funny, but the moment has passed before I have a chance to type it.\u201d He is working on ways to be more interactive in his shows.</p> <p>Does he ever hit the wrong button? \u201cI did say fuck in front of the mayor of Sunderland once.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s funny hearing \u201cfuck\u201d in a posh, robotic voice (because I\u2019m basically a child). But Ridley goes along with my puerilism. We type in the C-word \u2026 OK, I do: I\u2019ve stolen his voice. \u201cNow I sound like you,\u201d I type. Was that a laugh? Not loud, more like a little chuckle. I\u2019m taking it, though, putting it on a T-shirt: I Made Lost Voice Guy Laugh.</p> <p><em>Lost Voice Guy is <a href=\"http://lostvoiceguy.com/gigs/\" title=\"\">currently touring</a> Britain.

Some of it he has already written, for my pre-cooked questions, then just pressed the button. And we had a couple of email exchanges afterwards. Our time together was over ridiculously quickly. We did manage to talk about football (he supports the Magpies, in spite of being from the wrong side of the Tyne). And relationships: he\u2019s not in one at the moment. \u201cI always seem to fuck them up. I have a habit of overthinking and worry about things for no reason, for example I always worry what people think about my disability and I worry if I\u2019m good enough for them.\u201d Haven\u2019t there been loads of offers now that he is rich and famous? \u201cNot from anyone sane.\u201d The iPad is interesting. A page of labelled squares, \u201cIntros\u201d, \u201csaw me on BGT\u201d \u2026 and they all lead to other pages and other squares: \u201cJay-Z\u201d, \u201cdisabled card\u201d, \u201cgovernment hunger games\u201d. Ridley can steer his show, navigating through about five hours of material. Isn\u2019t it frustrating, not being able to be more spontaneous? \u201cIt\u2019s really annoying at times when I think of something onstage but can\u2019t really do anything about it, but the worst is when I\u2019m out with my mates and think of something funny, but the moment has passed before I have a chance to type it.\u201d He is working on ways to be more interactive in his shows. Does he ever hit the wrong button? \u201cI did say fuck in front of the mayor of Sunderland once.\u201d It\u2019s funny hearing \u201cfuck\u201d in a posh, robotic voice (because I\u2019m basically a child). But Ridley goes along with my puerilism. We type in the C-word \u2026 OK, I do: I\u2019ve stolen his voice. \u201cNow I sound like you,\u201d I type. Was that a laugh? Not loud, more like a little chuckle. I\u2019m taking it, though, putting it on a T-shirt: I Made Lost Voice Guy Laugh. Lost Voice Guy is currently touring Britain. His book, I\u2019m Only In It for the Parking, is published by Transworld. The second series of his sitcom Ability starts on BBC Radio 4 on 3 April",

This prompted many women to voice their anger at having been seemingly hoodwinked by ill-advised or ignorant doctors \u2013 as well as to wonder what other misinformation about the pill women may have been given in the past 60 years.</p> <p>Let\u2019s look into the mythology surrounding the pill by answering these common questions.</p> <h2><strong>Why is a break week included in pill packets?</strong></h2> <p>Pharmaceutical companies have usually provided either just 21 pills or seven inactive pills in each monthly packet since the contraceptive first became available. Lisa Hendrickson-Jack describes the reason behind this in her book <a href=\"http://thefifthvitalsignbook.com/\" title=\"\">The Fifth Vital Sign</a>: \u201cThe women who participated in the first round of testing for the very first pill, Enovid, stopped getting their periods, and quickly became convinced they were pregnant. They were devastated when they learned the truth \u2013 that the pill stopped them from having periods. It was at this point that the creators of the first pill added in a withdrawal bleed.\u201d The idea was that if the pill mimicked the natural cycle, it would encourage more women to use it.</p> <p>While these so-called \u201cpill bleeds\u201d have always been referred to as \u201cperiods\u201d by most medical professionals, they bear no physiological or medical resemblance to menstruation. Women in the 1960s, just like women now, mistakenly believed this withdrawal bleed indicated the absence of pregnancy, and therefore the efficacy of the pill. In fact, you can have a withdrawal bleed and still be pregnant.</p> <h2><strong>Will taking the pill regulate my cycle?</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2011/many-american-women-use-birth-control-pills-noncontraceptive-reasons\" title=\"\">Almost one in three women</a> are reported to be taking the pill on the advice that it will regulate their periods. Again, the bleeds you experience on the pill are not menstruation. The fluctuating hormones, ovulation and menstruation that make up your menstrual cycle are suppressed and replaced by a steady, consistent stream of synthetic hormones (synthetic oestrogen and progestin). The bleeds indicate your body\u2019s response to the withdrawal of these synthetic hormones \u2013 a small amount of uterine lining builds up and then comes away. Some women may not experience a bleed at all, or only spotting.</p> <h2><strong>Does the pill affect mood?</strong></h2> <p>Women may have been assured by their doctor that the pill does not affect their mood \u2013 or has a positive impact, by preventing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. In fact, in recent years, two large-scale studies from the University of Copenhagen have revealed that, for users of the combined pill, the likelihood of a diagnosis of depression <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2552796\" title=\"\">is increased</a> (by 23%) and, for users of all hormonal contraceptive types, risk of suicide <a href=\"https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.2017.17060616?journalCode=ajp&amp;\" title=\"\">is increased</a> threefold. These studies revealed that for teenagers, clinical depression diagnosis is 80% higher and suicide risk doubles after just one year of use.

Incidences of uterine, endometrial, ovarian and colorectal cancers are reduced in women who take the pill. I would argue that there are far better ways to prevent cancer that can benefit your entire body and come with much fewer side-effects.\u201d Looking at only the two most common female cancer types, for women who use the pill for a decade or more, a systematic <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK70001/\" title=\"\">review of 28 scientific studies</a> revealed that the risk of cervical cancer doubles; and <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1700732\" title=\"\">a study of 1.8 million women</a> revealed that the risk of breast cancer increases by 38%.</p> <h2><strong>What is the risk for blood clots?</strong></h2> <p>Newer combined oral contraceptives, as well as synthetic-hormone-based devices such as the ring, have a higher risk of blood clots \u2013 and the consequent serious or even fatal complications \u2013 than older combined oral contraceptives. You may already know that you are at elevated risk on any pill if you are overweight, over 35 or if you smoke \u2013 but you are also at far higher risk if you have factor V Leiden, an inherited blood clotting disorder that is <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6403/factor-v-leiden-thrombophilia\" title=\"\">considered very common</a>. The risk of death due to blood clots is one in 12,000 for women on the pill, compared with one in 50,000 for non-users \u2013 and the risk of hospitalisation is one in 2,000, compared with one in 20,000. As David Rowan details in <a href=\"https://www.johnhuntpublishing.com/ayni-books/our-books/my-beautiful-memory\" title=\"\">My Beautiful Memory</a>, a memoir of the death of his daughter, by pharmaceutical companies\u2019 own estimates, this equates to the deaths of about 1,000 women a year in the US alone; it would be approximately 250 women a year in the UK. By comparison, about 250 people have died worldwide taking selfies, and it has made headlines.</p> <h2><strong>Is being on the pill like being pregnant?</strong></h2> <p>Women are told the pill \u201ctricks\u201d the body into thinking it is pregnant, and that side-effects (such as weight gain) are similar to those experienced during pregnancy. Lara Briden, author of <a href=\"https://www.larabriden.com/period-repair-manual/\" title=\"\">Period Repair Manual</a>, clarifies: \u201cThe pill is not like pregnancy for the simple reason that contraceptive drugs are not pregnancy hormones. In fact, the state of being on the pill is more like a temporary, chemically induced menopause in which hormones are suppressed and replaced with contraceptive drugs that have vastly different effects compared with our own human hormones.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Does the pill affect fertility?</strong></h2> <p>We understand the pill to be a reversible method of contraception \u2013 and it is commonly believed that fertility returns rapidly post-pill. However, while some women conceive rapidly post-pill, intentionally or unintentionally, others do not. This can depend on prior reproductive health issues, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, which will return once the pill is stopped.</p> <p>Maisie Hill, a women\u2019s health practitioner and the author of the forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Period-Power-Harness-Hormones-Working/dp/147296361X\" title=\"\">Period Power</a>, says: \u201cWe know from research that women on the pill experience a reduction in ovarian volume and production of AMH \u2013 a hormone that\u2019s tested to assess fertility \u2013 whilst they\u2019re taking it, so it can take a while for the ovaries to regain function.\u201d There is, she says, \u201can association between long-term pill use and a thin uterine lining, which is important, because a suboptimal endometrial thickness has a negative impact on your ability to conceive. The pill reduces absorption of vitamins and minerals that are essential for regular ovulation, as well as conceiving and sustaining a pregnancy.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Does the pill make you gain weight?</strong></h2> <p>The correlation between some hormonal contraceptives and weight gain is proven, with the contraceptive injection <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090304182111.htm\" title=\"\">showing a significant effect</a>; however, the <a href=\"https://www.cochrane.org/CD008815/FERTILREG_effects-progestin-only-birth-control-weight\" title=\"\">research is conflicting</a> when it comes to the pill. Many women do report gaining weight on the pill, and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21134497\" title=\"\">doctors are actively encouraged</a> to quash such concerns to promote continued pill use. Other known side-effects <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1359105308095977\" title=\"\">such as depression</a> may contribute to weight gain.</p> <h2><strong>Did I break up with my boyfriend because of the pill?</strong></h2> <p>Women often report feeling a change in attraction to their partner if they go on or off the pill during the course of a relationship. The experience is so widespread that Dr Julie Holland, in her book <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/314941/moody-bitches-by-julie-holland-md/9780143107903/\" title=\"\">Moody Bitches</a>, says she recommends that her patients stop taking the pill at least six months before their wedding day. Dr Sarah E Hill, a professor of psychology and author of the forthcoming book This Is Your Brain on Birth Control, agrees there might be a connection: \u201cThere is research that finds that going off the pill, if women chose their partners when on it, can lead to undesirable changes in relationship satisfaction. However, a recent attempt to replicate this result failed to find this pattern. The pill may influence women\u2019s relationships with men (and there\u2019s every reason to expect that it will, when we consider the way that sex hormones work), but we need more research to understand the conditions in which this does and does not happen.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Holly Grigg-Spall is a womens\u2019 health activist and author of Sweetening the Pill:Or How We Got Hooked On Hormonal Birth Control.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 February 2019 to clarify that a study of 1.8 million women revealed that the risk of breast cancer increased by 38%, not that there was an overall risk of 38%.</p>",

Apparently, we are too indulgent of those who can claim victim status, a state especially rife among students. The story goes that this has turned us all into eternal babies, coddling us, protecting us from \u201cmicro aggressions\u201d and signalling an erosion of individual grit and autonomy in favour of mimsy whining. In an effort to invert unfair power structures, some claim, victimhood culture has only succeeded in replacing them with different unfair power structures, where those who used to be at the bottom now hold the whip hand over those who used to be at the top. Women terrify men, who are forever fearful an offhand remark will become a harassment lawsuit, and racial minorities secure jobs at the expense of white people the moment their unusual names are spotted on a CV. The writer Lionel Shriver called it \u201cprivileging the disadvantaged\u201d. Shriver also told BBC Radio 4 that white men in the UK are on the bottom rung of society, because they are considered to be the most powerful demographic (reader, I can reveal they are). Victimhood culture advocates engage in a lot of doublethink. I have tried to find this victimhood culture in real life and am sad to report that its dividends are elusive.

But they also entomb vast tracts of fertile soil, constipate rivers, choke habitats and \u2013 acting as a rock-hard second skin \u2013 desensitise us from what is happening outside our urban fortresses.</p> \n<p>Our blue and green world is becoming greyer by the second.

Our built environment is, in these terms, outgrowing the natural one. Unlike the natural world, however, it does not actually grow. Instead, its chief quality is to harden and then degrade, extremely slowly.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"017e10d2-22d4-4aee-ba3a-589ed67efba9\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This week Guardian Cities investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the planet, to learn what we can do to bring about a less grey world.</p>\n    <p>Our species is addicted to concrete.

In this series of articles, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/guardian-concrete-week\">Concrete Week</a> will explore the impact of the material on our environment and us, and look at alternative options for the future.</p>\n    <p><b>Chris Michael, Cities editor</b><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>All the plastic produced over the past 60 years amounts to 8bn tonnes. The cement industry pumps out more than that every two years. But though the problem is bigger than plastic, it is generally seen as less severe. Concrete is not derived from fossil fuels. It is not being found in the stomachs of whales and seagulls. Doctors aren\u2019t discovering traces of it in our blood. Nor do we see it tangled in oak trees or contributing to subterranean fatbergs. We know where we are with concrete. Or to be more precise, we know where it is going: nowhere. Which is exactly why we have come to rely on it.</p> \n<p>This solidity, of course, is what humankind yearns for. Concrete is beloved for its weight and endurance. That is why it serves as the foundation of modern life, holding time, nature, the elements and entropy at bay. When combined with steel, it is the material that ensures our dams don\u2019t burst, our tower blocks don\u2019t fall, our roads don\u2019t buckle and our electricity grid remains connected.</p> \n<p>Solidity is a particularly attractive quality at a time of disorientating change. But \u2013 like any good thing in excess \u2013 it can create more problems than it solves. </p> \n<p>At times an unyielding ally, at times a false friend, concrete can resist nature for decades and then suddenly amplify its impact. Take the floods in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and Houston after Harvey, which were more severe because urban and suburban streets could not soak up the rain like a floodplain, and storm drains proved <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/08/why-cities-flood/538251/\">woefully inadequate</a> for the new extremes of a disrupted climate. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1569e0150a8859836170f511c061bae622240433\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1569e0150a8859836170f511c061bae622240433/0_0_2979_1787/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The levee of the 17th Street Canal, New Orleans, after it was breached during Hurricane Katrina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When the levee breaks ...

Taking in all stages of production, concrete is said to be responsible for <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/2018-06-13-making-concrete-change-cement-lehne-preston-final.pdf\">4-8%</a> of the world\u2019s CO2. Among materials, only coal, oil and gas are a greater source of greenhouse gases. Half of concrete\u2019s CO2 emissions are created during the manufacture of clinker, the most-energy intensive part of the cement-making process. </p> \n<p>But other environmental impacts are far less well understood. Concrete is a thirsty behemoth, sucking up almost a 10th of the world\u2019s industrial water use. This often strains supplies for drinking and irrigation, because <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-017-0009-5\">75% of this consumption is in drought and water-stressed regions</a>. In cities, concrete also adds to the heat-island effect by absorbing the warmth of the sun and trapping gases from car exhausts and air-conditioner units \u2013 though it is, at least, better than darker asphalt.</p> \n<p>It also worsens the problem of silicosis and other respiratory diseases. The dust from wind-blown stocks and mixers contributes as much as 10% of the coarse particulate matter that chokes Delhi, where researchers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/feb/15/delhi-deadly-dust-how-construction-sites-choking-city\">found in 2015</a> that the air pollution index at all of the 19 biggest construction sites exceeded safe levels by at least three times. Limestone quarries and cement factories are also often pollution sources, along with the trucks that ferry materials between them and building sites. At this scale, even the acquisition of sand can be catastrophic \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/feb/27/sand-mining-global-environmental-crisis-never-heard\">destroying so many</a> of the world\u2019s beaches and river courses that this form of mining is now <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/03/illegal-sand-mining/\">increasingly run</a> by organised crime gangs and associated with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/30/india-sand-mining-conflict-deaths-building-boom-environmental-damage\">murderous violence</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/25/concrete-is-tipping-us-into-climate-catastrophe-its-payback-time-cement-tax\">Concrete is tipping us into climate catastrophe. It's payback time</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This touches on the most severe, but least understood, impact of concrete, which is that it destroys natural infrastructure without replacing the ecological functions that humanity depends on for fertilisation, pollination, flood control, oxygen production and water purification.</p> \n<p>Concrete can take our civilisation upwards, up to 163 storeys high in the case of the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai, creating living space out of the air. But it also pushes the human footprint outwards, sprawling across fertile topsoil and choking habitats. The biodiversity crisis \u2013 which many scientists believe to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/23/destruction-of-nature-as-dangerous-as-climate-change-scientists-warn\">as much of a threat as climate chaos</a> \u2013 is driven primarily by the conversion of wilderness to agriculture, industrial estates and residential blocks.</p> \n<p>For hundreds of years, humanity has been willing to accept this environmental downside in return for the undoubted benefits of concrete. But the balance may now be tilting in the other direction.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>The Pantheon and Colosseum in Rome are testament to the durability of concrete, which is a composite of sand, aggregate (usually gravel or stones) and water mixed with a lime-based, kiln-baked binder. The modern industrialised form of the binder \u2013 Portland cement \u2013 was patented as a form of \u201cartificial stone\u201d in 1824 by Joseph Aspdin in Leeds. This was later combined with steel rods or mesh to create reinforced concrete, the basis for art deco skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building.</p> \n<p>Rivers of it were poured after the second world war, when concrete offered an inexpensive and simple way to rebuild cities devastated by bombing. This was the period of brutalist architects <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2017/apr/07/the-city-le-corbusier-built-inside-chandigarh-in-pictures\">such as Le Corbusier</a>, followed by the futuristic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/gallery/2014/jun/12/bend-it-like-niemeyer-10-of-the-best-buildings-in-brazil\">free-flowing curves of Oscar Niemeyer</a> and the elegant lines of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/picture/2017/aug/17/buddha-in-hills-hokkaido-japan-travel-photo-of-the-week\">Tadao Ando</a> \u2013 not to mention an ever-growing legion of dams, bridges, ports, city halls, university campuses, shopping centres and uniformly grim car parks. In 1950, cement production was equal to that of steel; in the years since, it has increased 25-fold, more than three times as fast as its metallic construction partner.</p> \n<p>Debate about the aesthetics has tended to polarise between traditionalists like Prince Charles, who condemned Owen Luder\u2019s brutalist Tricorn Centre as a \u201cmildewed lump of elephant droppings\u201d, and modernists who saw concrete as a means of making style, size and strength affordable for the masses.</p> \n<p>The politics of concrete are less divisive, but more corrosive. The main problem here is inertia. Once this material binds politicians, bureaucrats and construction companies, the resulting nexus is almost impossible to budge. Party leaders need the donations and kickbacks from building firms to get elected, state planners need more projects to maintain economic growth, and construction bosses need more contracts to keep money rolling in, staff employed and political influence high. Hence the self-perpetuating political enthusiasm for environmentally and socially dubious infrastructure projects and cement-fests like the Olympics, the World Cup and international exhibitions.</p> \n<p>The classic example is Japan, which embraced concrete in the second half of the 20th century with such enthusiasm that the country\u2019s governance structure was often described as the <em>doken </em><em>kokka</em> (construction state).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10580a183bad1960108c1aaa28728d75a169dce8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10580a183bad1960108c1aaa28728d75a169dce8/0_0_2200_1650/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The pressure-controlled water tank at the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel in Kusakabe, Japan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pressure-controlled water tank in Kusakabe, Japan, constructed to protect Tokyo against floodwaters and overflow of the city\u2019s major waterways and rivers during heavy rain and typhoon seasons.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ho New/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At first it was a cheap material to rebuild cities ravaged by fire bombs and nuclear warheads in the second world war. Then it provided the foundations for a new model of super-rapid economic development: new railway tracks for Shinkansen bullet trains, new bridges and tunnels for elevated expressways, new runways for airports, new stadiums for the 1964 Olympics and the Osaka Expo, and new city halls, schools and sports facilities.</p> \n<p>This kept the economy racing along at near double-digit growth rates until the late 1980s, ensuring employment remained high and giving the ruling Liberal Democratic party a stranglehold on power. The political heavyweights of the era \u2013 men such as Kakuei Tanaka, Yasuhiro Nakasone and Noboru Takeshita \u2013 were judged by their ability to bring hefty projects to their hometowns. Huge kickbacks were the norm. Yakuza gangsters, who served as go-betweens and enforcers, also got their cut. Bid-rigging and near monopolies by the big six building firms (Shimizu, Taisei, Kajima, Takenaka, Obayashi, Kumagai) ensured contracts were lucrative enough to provide hefty kickbacks to the politicians. The <em>doken </em><em>kokka</em> was a racket on a national scale.</p> \n<p>But there is only so much concrete you can usefully lay without ruining the environment. The ever-diminishing returns were made apparent in the 1990s, when even the most creative politicians struggled to justify the government\u2019s stimulus spending packages. This was a period of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/world/asia/06japan.html\">extraordinarily expensive bridges</a> to sparsely inhabited regions, multi-lane roads between tiny rural communities, cementing over the few remaining natural riverbanks, and pouring ever greater volumes of concrete into the sea walls that were supposed to protect 40% of the Japanese coastline.</p> \n<p>In his book Dogs and Demons, the author and longtime Japanese resident Alex Kerr laments the cementing over of riverbanks and hillsides in the name of flood and mudslide prevention. Runaway government-subsidised construction projects, he told an <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2002/04/25/environment/japan-a-land-gone-to-the-dogs/#.XGqQqUX7RhE,\">interviewer</a>, \u201chave wreaked untold damage on mountains, rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, everywhere \u2014 and it goes on at a heightened pace. That is the reality of modern Japan, and the numbers are staggering.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said the amount of concrete laid per square metre in Japan is 30 times the amount in America, and that the volume is almost exactly the same. \u201cSo we\u2019re talking about a country the size of California laying the same amount of concrete [as the entire US]. Multiply America\u2019s strip malls and urban sprawl by 30 to get a sense of what\u2019s going on in Japan.\u201d</p> \n<p>Traditionalists and environmentalists were horrified \u2013 and ignored. The cementation of Japan ran contrary to classic aesthetic ideals of harmony with nature and an appreciation of <em>mujo</em> (impermanence), but was understandable given the ever-present fear of earthquakes and tsunamis in one of the world\u2019s most seismically active nations. Everyone knew the grey banked rivers and shorelines were ugly, but nobody cared as long as they could keep their homes from being flooded.</p> \n<p>Which made the devastating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/11/japan-remembers-the-18000-victims-of-2011s-triple-disaster-fukushima\">2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami</a> all the more shocking. At coastal towns such as Ishinomaki, Kamaishi and Kitakami, huge sea walls that had been built over decades were swamped in minutes. Almost 16,000 people died, a million buildings were destroyed or damaged, town streets were blocked with beached ships and port waters were filled with floating cars. It was a still more alarming story at Fukushima, where the ocean surge engulfed the outer defences of the Fukushima Daiichi<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster\"> </a>nuclear plant and caused a level 7 meltdown.</p> \n<p>Briefly, it seemed this might become a King Canute moment for Japan \u2013 when the folly of human hubris was exposed by the power of nature. But the concrete lobby was just too strong. The Liberal Democratic party returned to power a year later with a promise to spend 200tn yen (\u00a31.4tn) on public works over the next decade, equivalent to about 40% of Japan\u2019s economic output.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8a76c94d0dc10d000dc40d2bae7ed146fefd44f7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a76c94d0dc10d000dc40d2bae7ed146fefd44f7/0_316_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bus drives past a seawall in Yamada, Iwate prefecture, Japan, in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It feels like we\u2019re in jail, even though we haven\u2019t done anything bad\u2019 ...

Their value is contested. Engineers claim these 12-metre-high walls of concrete will stop or at least slow future tsunamis, but locals have heard such promises before. The area these defences protect is also of lower human worth now the land has been largely depopulated and filled with paddy fields and fish farms. Environmentalists say mangrove forests could provide a far cheaper buffer. Tellingly, even many tsunami-scarred locals hate the concrete between them and the ocean.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re in jail, even though we haven\u2019t done anything bad,\u201d an oyster fisherman, Atsushi Fujita, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-disaster-seawalls/seven-years-after-tsunami-japanese-live-uneasily-with-seawalls-idUSKCN1GL0DK\">told Reuters</a>. \u201cWe can no longer see the sea,\u201d said the Tokyo-born photographer <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/photo-gallery-japan-seawalls/\">Tadashi Ono</a>, who took some of the most powerful images of these massive new structures. He described them as an abandonment of Japanese history and culture. \u201cOur richness as a civilisation is because of our contact with the ocean,\u201d he said. \u201cJapan has always lived with the sea, and we were protected by the sea. And now the Japanese government has decided to shut out the sea.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>There was an inevitability about this. Across the world, concrete has become synonymous with development. In theory, the laudable goal of human progress is measured by a series of economic and social indicators, such as life-expectancy, infant mortality and education levels. But to political leaders, by far the most important metric is gross domestic product, a measure of economic activity that, more often than not, is treated as a calculation of economic size. GDP is how governments assess their weight in the world. And nothing bulks up a country like concrete.</p> \n<p>That is true of all countries at some stage. During their early stages of development, heavyweight construction projects are beneficial like a boxer putting on muscle. But for already mature economies, it is harmful like an aged athlete pumping ever stronger steroids to ever less effect. During the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, Keynesian economic advisers told the Japanese government the best way to stimulate GDP growth was to dig a hole in the ground and fill it. Preferably with cement. The bigger the hole, the better. This meant profits and jobs. Of course, it is much easier to mobilise a nation to do something that improves people\u2019s lives, but either way concrete is likely to be part of the arrangement. This was the thinking behind Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal in the 1930s, which is celebrated in the US as a recession-busting national project but might also be described as the biggest ever concrete-pouring exercise up until that point. The Hoover Dam alone <a href=\"https://delzottoproducts.com/2017/03/15/long-will-take-concrete-hoover-dam-cure/\">required 3.3m cubic metres,</a> then a world record. Construction firms claimed it would outlast human civilisation. </p> \n<p>But that was lightweight compared to what is now happening in China, the concrete superpower of the 21st century and the greatest illustration of how the material transforms a culture (a civilisation intertwined with nature) into an economy (a production unit obsessed by GDP statistics). Beijing\u2019s extraordinarily rapid rise from developing nation to superpower-in-waiting has required mountains of cement, beaches of sand and lakes of water. The speed at which these materials are being mixed is perhaps the most astonishing <a href=\"https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Concrete-in-China\">statistic</a> of the modern age: since 2003, China has poured more cement every three years than the US managed in the entire 20th century.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/28/the-grey-wall-of-china-inside-the-worlds-concrete-superpower\">The grey wall of China: inside the world's concrete superpower</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Today, China uses almost half the world\u2019s concrete. The property sector \u2013 roads, bridges, railways, urban development and other cement-and-steel projects \u2013 accounted for a third of its economy\u2019s expansion in 2017. Every major city has a floor-sized scale model of urban development plans that has to be constantly updated as small white plastic models are turned into mega-malls, housing complexes and concrete towers.</p> \n<p>But, like the US, Japan, South Korea and every other country that \u201cdeveloped\u201d before it, China is reaching the point where simply pouring concrete does more harm than good. Ghost malls, half-empty towns and white elephant stadiums are a growing sign of wasteful spending. Take the huge new airport in Luliang, which opened with barely five flights a day, or the Olympic Bird\u2019s Nest stadium, so underused that it is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/aug/22/birds-nest-empty-monument-china-magnificence\">more a monument than a venue</a>. Although the adage \u201cbuild and the people will come\u201d has often proved correct in the past, the Chinese government is worried. After the National Bureau of Statistics found 450 sq km of <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/property/article/1903244/chinas-inventory-unsold-new-homes-rises-112pc-2015\">unsold residential floor space</a>, the country\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, called for the \u201cannihilation\u201d of excess developments.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d4d585d3ec67fd50d79630141552bd9ff570e36f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4d585d3ec67fd50d79630141552bd9ff570e36f/1293_0_3207_1925/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, China is the largest concrete structure in the world.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, China, is the largest concrete structure in the world.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laoma/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Empty, crumbling structures are not just an eyesore, but a drain on the economy and a waste of productive land. Ever greater construction requires ever more cement and steel factories, discharging ever more pollution and carbon dioxide. As the Chinese landscape architect Yu Kongjian has pointed out, it also suffocates the ecosystems \u2013 fertile soil, self-cleansing streams, storm-resisting mangrove swamps, flood-preventing forests \u2013 on which human beings ultimately depend. It is a threat to what he calls \u201ceco-security\u201d.</p> \n<p>Yu has led the charge against concrete, ripping it up whenever possible to restore riverbanks and natural vegetation. In his influential book The Art of Survival, he warns that China has moved dangerously far from Taoist ideals of harmony with nature. \u201cThe urbanisation process we follow today is a path to death,\u201d he has said.</p> \n<p>Yu has been consulted by government officials, who are increasingly aware of the brittleness of the current Chinese model of growth. But their scope for movement is limited. The initial momentum of a concrete economy is always followed by inertia in concrete politics. The president has promised a shift of economic focus away from belching heavy industries and towards high-tech production in order to create a \u201cbeautiful country\u201d and an \u201cecological civilisation\u201d, and the government is now trying to wind down from the biggest construction boom in human history, but Xi cannot let the construction sector simply fade away, because it employs more than 55 million workers \u2013 almost the entire population of the UK. Instead, China is doing what countless other nations have done, exporting its environmental stress and excess capacity overseas.</p> \n<p>Beijing\u2019s much-vaunted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/what-china-belt-road-initiative-silk-road-explainer\">Belt and Road Initiative</a> \u2013 an overseas infrastructure investment project many times greater than the Marshall Plan \u2013 promises a splurge of roads in Kazakhstan, <a href=\"https://www.internationalrivers.org/campaigns/chinese-dams-in-africa\">at least 15 dams in Africa</a>, <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2018/11/china-increasingly-involved-in-brazils-ambitious-amazon-rail-network/\">railways in Brazil</a> and ports in Pakistan, Greece and Sri Lanka. To supply these and other projects, China National Building Material \u2013 the country\u2019s biggest cement producer \u2013 has announced <a href=\"http://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201712/13/WS5a3015c8a3108bc8c672b094.html\">plans to construct</a> 100 cement factories across 50 nations. </p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>This will almost certainly mean more criminal activity. As well as being the primary vehicle for super-charged national building, the construction industry is also the widest channel for bribes. In many countries, the correlation is so strong, people see it as an index: the more concrete, the more corruption.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://issuu.com/transparencyinternational/docs/bribe_payers_index_2011?mode=window&amp;backgroundColor=%23222222\">According to</a> the watchdog group Transparency International, construction is the world\u2019s dirtiest business, far more prone to graft than mining, real estate, energy or the arms market. No country is immune, but in recent years, Brazil has revealed most clearly the jawdropping scale of bribery in the industry.</p> \n<p>As elsewhere, the craze for concrete in South America\u2019s biggest nation started benignly enough as a means of social development, then morphed into an economic necessity, and finally metastasised into a tool for political expediency and individual greed. The progress between these stages was impressively rapid. The first huge national project in the late 1950s was the construction of a new capital, Bras\u00edlia, on an almost uninhabited plateau in the interior. A million cubic metres of concrete were poured on the highlands site in just 41 months to encase the soil and erect new edifices for ministries and homes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ccdd2de3e0eaf1bcd510215350d1be5d8839545e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccdd2de3e0eaf1bcd510215350d1be5d8839545e/0_180_5133_3082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The National Museum of the Republic by Oscar Niemeyer, Bras\u00edlia, Brazil.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The National Museum of the Republic by Oscar Niemeyer, Bras\u00edlia, Brazil.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image Broker/Rex Features</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This was followed by a new highway through the Amazon rainforest \u2013 the TransAmazonia \u2013 and then from 1970, South America\u2019s biggest hydroelectric power plant, the Itaipu on the Paran\u00e1 river border with Paraguay, which is almost four times bulkier than the Hoover Dam. The Brazilian operators boast the 12.3m cubic metres of concrete would be enough to fill 210 Maracan\u00e3 stadiums. This was a world record until China\u2019s Three Gorges Dam choked the Yangtze with 27.2m cubic metres.</p> \n<p>With the military in power, the press censored and no independent judiciary, there was no way of knowing how much of the budget was siphoned off by the generals and contractors. But the problem of corruption has become all too apparent since 1985 in the post-dictatorship era, with virtually no party or politician left untainted.</p> \n<p>For many years, the most notorious of them was Paulo Maluf, the governor of S\u00e3o Paulo, who had run the city during the construction of the giant elevated expressway known as Minhoc\u00e3o, which means Big Worm. As well as taking credit for this project, which opened in 1969, he also allegedly skimmed $1bn from public works in just four years, part of which has been traced to secret accounts in the British Virgin islands. Although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/16/brazil-mayor-millions-taxpayers-jersey\">wanted by Interpol</a>, Maluf evaded justice for decades and was elected to a number of senior public offices. This was thanks to a high degree of public cynicism encapsulated by the phrase most commonly used about him: \u201cHe steals, but he gets things done\u201d \u2013 which could describe much of the global concrete industry.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c021f2fe07b7e6c07b70dbd7fedae19b1bb7662\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c021f2fe07b7e6c07b70dbd7fedae19b1bb7662/0_214_4421_2652/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paulo Maluf listens to the debate over the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in Bras\u00edlia, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paulo Maluf attending the debate over the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in Bras\u00edlia, 2016.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But his reputation as the most corrupt man in Brazil has been overshadowed in the past five years by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/01/brazil-operation-car-wash-is-this-the-biggest-corruption-scandal-in-history\">Operation Car Wash</a>, an investigation into a vast network of bid-rigging and money laundering. Giant construction firms \u2013 notably Odebrecht, Andrade Gutierrez and Camargo Corr\u00eaa \u2013 were at the heart of this sprawling scheme, which saw politicians, bureaucrats and middle-men receive at least $2bn worth of kickbacks in return for hugely inflated contracts for oil refineries, the Belo Monte dam, the 2014 World Cup, the 2016 Olympics and dozens of other infrastructure projects throughout the region. Prosecutors said Odebrecht alone had paid bribes to 415 politicians and 26 political parties.</p> \n<p>As a result of these revelations, one government fell, a former president of Brazil and the vice president of Ecuador are in prison, the president of Peru was forced to resign, and dozens of other politicians and executives were put behind bars. The corruption scandal also reached Europe and Africa. The US Department of Justice called it \u201cthe largest foreign bribery case in history\u201d. It was so huge that when Maluf was finally arrested in 2017, nobody batted an eyelid.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>Such corruption is not just a theft of tax revenue, it is a motivation for environmental crime: billions of tonnes of CO2 pumped into the atmosphere for projects of dubious social value and often pushed through \u2013 as in the case of Belo Monte \u2013 against the opposition of affected local residents and with deep concerns among environmental licensing authorities.</p> \n<p>Although the dangers are increasingly apparent, this pattern continues to repeat itself. India and Indonesia are just entering their high-concrete phase of development. Over the next 40 years, the newly built floor area in the world is expected to double. Some of that will bring health benefits. The environmental scientist Vaclav Smil <a href=\"https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Concrete-in-China\">estimates</a> the replacement of mud floors with concrete in the world\u2019s poorest homes could cut parasitic diseases by nearly 80%. But each wheelbarrow of concrete also tips the world closer to ecological collapse.</p> \n<p>Chatham House predicts urbanisation, population growth and economic development will push global cement production from 4 to 5bn tonnes a year. If developing countries expand their infrastructure to current average global levels, the construction sector will emit 470 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide by 2050, according to the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.</p> \n<p>This violates the Paris agreement on climate change, under which every government in the world agreed that annual carbon emissions from the cement industry should fall by at least 16% by 2030 if the world is to reach the target of staying within 1.5C to 2C of warming. It also puts a crushing weight on the ecosystems that are essential for human wellbeing.</p> \n<p>The dangers are recognised. A <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/making-concrete-change-innovation-low-carbon-cement-and-concrete\">report</a> last year by Chatham House calls for a rethink in the way cement is produced. To reduce emissions, it urges greater use of renewables in production, improved energy efficiency, more substitutes for clinker and, most important, the widespread adoption of carbon capture and storage technology \u2013 though this is expensive and has not yet been deployed in the industry on a commercial scale.</p> \n<p>Architects believe the answer is to make buildings leaner and, when possible, to use other materials, such as cross-laminated timber. It is time to move out of the \u201cconcrete age\u201d and stop thinking primarily about how a building looks, said Anthony Thistleton.</p> \n<p>\u201cConcrete is beautiful and versatile but, unfortunately, it ticks all the boxes in terms of environmental degradation,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/concrete-responsible-for-8-per-cent-of-all-co2-emissions-says-report/10038404.article\">told the Architects Journal</a>. \u201cWe have a responsibility to think about all the materials we are using and their wider impact.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/25/a-brief-history-of-concrete-from-10000bc-to-3d-printed-houses\">A brief history of concrete: from 10,000BC to 3D printed houses</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But many engineers argue that there is no viable alternative. Steel, asphalt and plasterboard are more energy intensive than concrete. The world\u2019s forests are already being depleted at an alarming rate even without a surge in extra demand for timber.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Phil_Purnell\">Phil Purnell</a>, a professor of materials and structures at Leeds University, said the world was unlikely to reach a \u201cpeak concrete\u201d moment.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe raw materials are virtually limitless and it will be in demand for as long as we build roads, bridges and anything else that needs a foundation,\u201d he said. \u201cBy almost any measure it\u2019s the least energy-hungry of all materials.\u201d</p> \n<p>Instead, he calls for existing structures to be better maintained and conserved, and, when that is not possible, to enhance recycling. Currently most concrete goes to landfill sites or is crushed and reused as aggregate. This could be done more efficiently, Purnell said, if slabs were embedded with identification tags that would allow the material to be matched with demand. His colleagues at Leeds University are also exploring alternatives to Portland cement. Different mixes can reduce the carbon footprint of a binder by up to two-thirds, they say.</p> \n<p>Arguably more important still is a change of mindset away from a developmental model that replaces living landscapes with built environments and nature-based cultures with data-driven economies. That requires tackling power structures that have been built on concrete, and recognising that fertility is a more reliable base for growth than solidity.</p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/guardian-concrete-week\">Guardian Concrete Week</a> investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the modern world.

      "bodyText": "In the time it takes you to read this sentence, the global building industry will have poured more than 19,000 bathtubs of concrete. By the time you are halfway through this article, the volume would fill the Albert Hall and spill out into Hyde Park. In a day it would be almost the size of China\u2019s Three Gorges Dam. In a single year, there is enough to patio over every hill, dale, nook and cranny in England. After water, concrete is the most widely used substance on Earth. If the cement industry were a country, it would be the third largest carbon dioxide emitter in the world with up to 2.8bn tonnes, surpassed only by China and the US. The material is the foundation of modern development, putting roofs over the heads of billions, fortifying our defences against natural disaster and providing a structure for healthcare, education, transport, energy and industry. Concrete is how we try to tame nature. Our slabs protect us from the elements. They keep the rain from our heads, the cold from our bones and the mud from our feet. But they also entomb vast tracts of fertile soil, constipate rivers, choke habitats and \u2013 acting as a rock-hard second skin \u2013 desensitise us from what is happening outside our urban fortresses. Our blue and green world is becoming greyer by the second. By one calculation, we may have already passed the point where concrete outweighs the combined carbon mass of every tree, bush and shrub on the planet. Our built environment is, in these terms, outgrowing the natural one. Unlike the natural world, however, it does not actually grow. Instead, its chief quality is to harden and then degrade, extremely slowly. All the plastic produced over the past 60 years amounts to 8bn tonnes. The cement industry pumps out more than that every two years. But though the problem is bigger than plastic, it is generally seen as less severe. Concrete is not derived from fossil fuels. It is not being found in the stomachs of whales and seagulls. Doctors aren\u2019t discovering traces of it in our blood. Nor do we see it tangled in oak trees or contributing to subterranean fatbergs. We know where we are with concrete. Or to be more precise, we know where it is going: nowhere. Which is exactly why we have come to rely on it. This solidity, of course, is what humankind yearns for. Concrete is beloved for its weight and endurance. That is why it serves as the foundation of modern life, holding time, nature, the elements and entropy at bay. When combined with steel, it is the material that ensures our dams don\u2019t burst, our tower blocks don\u2019t fall, our roads don\u2019t buckle and our electricity grid remains connected. Solidity is a particularly attractive quality at a time of disorientating change. But \u2013 like any good thing in excess \u2013 it can create more problems than it solves. At times an unyielding ally, at times a false friend, concrete can resist nature for decades and then suddenly amplify its impact. Take the floods in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and Houston after Harvey, which were more severe because urban and suburban streets could not soak up the rain like a floodplain, and storm drains proved woefully inadequate for the new extremes of a disrupted climate. It also magnifies the extreme weather it shelters us from. Taking in all stages of production, concrete is said to be responsible for 4-8% of the world\u2019s CO2. Among materials, only coal, oil and gas are a greater source of greenhouse gases. Half of concrete\u2019s CO2 emissions are created during the manufacture of clinker, the most-energy intensive part of the cement-making process. But other environmental impacts are far less well understood. Concrete is a thirsty behemoth, sucking up almost a 10th of the world\u2019s industrial water use. This often strains supplies for drinking and irrigation, because 75% of this consumption is in drought and water-stressed regions. In cities, concrete also adds to the heat-island effect by absorbing the warmth of the sun and trapping gases from car exhausts and air-conditioner units \u2013 though it is, at least, better than darker asphalt. It also worsens the problem of silicosis and other respiratory diseases. The dust from wind-blown stocks and mixers contributes as much as 10% of the coarse particulate matter that chokes Delhi, where researchers found in 2015 that the air pollution index at all of the 19 biggest construction sites exceeded safe levels by at least three times. Limestone quarries and cement factories are also often pollution sources, along with the trucks that ferry materials between them and building sites. At this scale, even the acquisition of sand can be catastrophic \u2013 destroying so many of the world\u2019s beaches and river courses that this form of mining is now increasingly run by organised crime gangs and associated with murderous violence. This touches on the most severe, but least understood, impact of concrete, which is that it destroys natural infrastructure without replacing the ecological functions that humanity depends on for fertilisation, pollination, flood control, oxygen production and water purification. Concrete can take our civilisation upwards, up to 163 storeys high in the case of the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai, creating living space out of the air. But it also pushes the human footprint outwards, sprawling across fertile topsoil and choking habitats. The biodiversity crisis \u2013 which many scientists believe to be as much of a threat as climate chaos \u2013 is driven primarily by the conversion of wilderness to agriculture, industrial estates and residential blocks. For hundreds of years, humanity has been willing to accept this environmental downside in return for the undoubted benefits of concrete. But the balance may now be tilting in the other direction. * * * The Pantheon and Colosseum in Rome are testament to the durability of concrete, which is a composite of sand, aggregate (usually gravel or stones) and water mixed with a lime-based, kiln-baked binder. The modern industrialised form of the binder \u2013 Portland cement \u2013 was patented as a form of \u201cartificial stone\u201d in 1824 by Joseph Aspdin in Leeds. This was later combined with steel rods or mesh to create reinforced concrete, the basis for art deco skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building. Rivers of it were poured after the second world war, when concrete offered an inexpensive and simple way to rebuild cities devastated by bombing. This was the period of brutalist architects such as Le Corbusier, followed by the futuristic, free-flowing curves of Oscar Niemeyer and the elegant lines of Tadao Ando \u2013 not to mention an ever-growing legion of dams, bridges, ports, city halls, university campuses, shopping centres and uniformly grim car parks. In 1950, cement production was equal to that of steel; in the years since, it has increased 25-fold, more than three times as fast as its metallic construction partner. Debate about the aesthetics has tended to polarise between traditionalists like Prince Charles, who condemned Owen Luder\u2019s brutalist Tricorn Centre as a \u201cmildewed lump of elephant droppings\u201d, and modernists who saw concrete as a means of making style, size and strength affordable for the masses. The politics of concrete are less divisive, but more corrosive. The main problem here is inertia. Once this material binds politicians, bureaucrats and construction companies, the resulting nexus is almost impossible to budge. Party leaders need the donations and kickbacks from building firms to get elected, state planners need more projects to maintain economic growth, and construction bosses need more contracts to keep money rolling in, staff employed and political influence high. Hence the self-perpetuating political enthusiasm for environmentally and socially dubious infrastructure projects and cement-fests like the Olympics, the World Cup and international exhibitions. The classic example is Japan, which embraced concrete in the second half of the 20th century with such enthusiasm that the country\u2019s governance structure was often described as the doken kokka (construction state). At first it was a cheap material to rebuild cities ravaged by fire bombs and nuclear warheads in the second world war. Then it provided the foundations for a new model of super-rapid economic development: new railway tracks for Shinkansen bullet trains, new bridges and tunnels for elevated expressways, new runways for airports, new stadiums for the 1964 Olympics and the Osaka Expo, and new city halls, schools and sports facilities. This kept the economy racing along at near double-digit growth rates until the late 1980s, ensuring employment remained high and giving the ruling Liberal Democratic party a stranglehold on power. The political heavyweights of the era \u2013 men such as Kakuei Tanaka, Yasuhiro Nakasone and Noboru Takeshita \u2013 were judged by their ability to bring hefty projects to their hometowns. Huge kickbacks were the norm. Yakuza gangsters, who served as go-betweens and enforcers, also got their cut. Bid-rigging and near monopolies by the big six building firms (Shimizu, Taisei, Kajima, Takenaka, Obayashi, Kumagai) ensured contracts were lucrative enough to provide hefty kickbacks to the politicians. The doken kokka was a racket on a national scale. But there is only so much concrete you can usefully lay without ruining the environment. The ever-diminishing returns were made apparent in the 1990s, when even the most creative politicians struggled to justify the government\u2019s stimulus spending packages. This was a period of extraordinarily expensive bridges to sparsely inhabited regions, multi-lane roads between tiny rural communities, cementing over the few remaining natural riverbanks, and pouring ever greater volumes of concrete into the sea walls that were supposed to protect 40% of the Japanese coastline. In his book Dogs and Demons, the author and longtime Japanese resident Alex Kerr laments the cementing over of riverbanks and hillsides in the name of flood and mudslide prevention. Runaway government-subsidised construction projects, he told an interviewer, \u201chave wreaked untold damage on mountains, rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, everywhere \u2014 and it goes on at a heightened pace. That is the reality of modern Japan, and the numbers are staggering.\u201d He said the amount of concrete laid per square metre in Japan is 30 times the amount in America, and that the volume is almost exactly the same. \u201cSo we\u2019re talking about a country the size of California laying the same amount of concrete [as the entire US]. Multiply America\u2019s strip malls and urban sprawl by 30 to get a sense of what\u2019s going on in Japan.\u201d Traditionalists and environmentalists were horrified \u2013 and ignored. The cementation of Japan ran contrary to classic aesthetic ideals of harmony with nature and an appreciation of mujo (impermanence), but was understandable given the ever-present fear of earthquakes and tsunamis in one of the world\u2019s most seismically active nations. Everyone knew the grey banked rivers and shorelines were ugly, but nobody cared as long as they could keep their homes from being flooded. Which made the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami all the more shocking. At coastal towns such as Ishinomaki, Kamaishi and Kitakami, huge sea walls that had been built over decades were swamped in minutes. Almost 16,000 people died, a million buildings were destroyed or damaged, town streets were blocked with beached ships and port waters were filled with floating cars. It was a still more alarming story at Fukushima, where the ocean surge engulfed the outer defences of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and caused a level 7 meltdown. Briefly, it seemed this might become a King Canute moment for Japan \u2013 when the folly of human hubris was exposed by the power of nature. But the concrete lobby was just too strong. The Liberal Democratic party returned to power a year later with a promise to spend 200tn yen (\u00a31.4tn) on public works over the next decade, equivalent to about 40% of Japan\u2019s economic output. Construction firms were once again ordered to hold back the sea, this time with even taller, thicker barriers. Their value is contested. Engineers claim these 12-metre-high walls of concrete will stop or at least slow future tsunamis, but locals have heard such promises before. The area these defences protect is also of lower human worth now the land has been largely depopulated and filled with paddy fields and fish farms. Environmentalists say mangrove forests could provide a far cheaper buffer. Tellingly, even many tsunami-scarred locals hate the concrete between them and the ocean. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re in jail, even though we haven\u2019t done anything bad,\u201d an oyster fisherman, Atsushi Fujita, told Reuters. \u201cWe can no longer see the sea,\u201d said the Tokyo-born photographer Tadashi Ono, who took some of the most powerful images of these massive new structures. He described them as an abandonment of Japanese history and culture. \u201cOur richness as a civilisation is because of our contact with the ocean,\u201d he said. \u201cJapan has always lived with the sea, and we were protected by the sea. And now the Japanese government has decided to shut out the sea.\u201d * * * There was an inevitability about this. Across the world, concrete has become synonymous with development. In theory, the laudable goal of human progress is measured by a series of economic and social indicators, such as life-expectancy, infant mortality and education levels. But to political leaders, by far the most important metric is gross domestic product, a measure of economic activity that, more often than not, is treated as a calculation of economic size. GDP is how governments assess their weight in the world. And nothing bulks up a country like concrete. That is true of all countries at some stage. During their early stages of development, heavyweight construction projects are beneficial like a boxer putting on muscle. But for already mature economies, it is harmful like an aged athlete pumping ever stronger steroids to ever less effect. During the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, Keynesian economic advisers told the Japanese government the best way to stimulate GDP growth was to dig a hole in the ground and fill it. Preferably with cement. The bigger the hole, the better. This meant profits and jobs. Of course, it is much easier to mobilise a nation to do something that improves people\u2019s lives, but either way concrete is likely to be part of the arrangement. This was the thinking behind Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal in the 1930s, which is celebrated in the US as a recession-busting national project but might also be described as the biggest ever concrete-pouring exercise up until that point. The Hoover Dam alone required 3.3m cubic metres, then a world record. Construction firms claimed it would outlast human civilisation. But that was lightweight compared to what is now happening in China, the concrete superpower of the 21st century and the greatest illustration of how the material transforms a culture (a civilisation intertwined with nature) into an economy (a production unit obsessed by GDP statistics). Beijing\u2019s extraordinarily rapid rise from developing nation to superpower-in-waiting has required mountains of cement, beaches of sand and lakes of water. The speed at which these materials are being mixed is perhaps the most astonishing statistic of the modern age: since 2003, China has poured more cement every three years than the US managed in the entire 20th century. Today, China uses almost half the world\u2019s concrete. The property sector \u2013 roads, bridges, railways, urban development and other cement-and-steel projects \u2013 accounted for a third of its economy\u2019s expansion in 2017. Every major city has a floor-sized scale model of urban development plans that has to be constantly updated as small white plastic models are turned into mega-malls, housing complexes and concrete towers. But, like the US, Japan, South Korea and every other country that \u201cdeveloped\u201d before it, China is reaching the point where simply pouring concrete does more harm than good. Ghost malls, half-empty towns and white elephant stadiums are a growing sign of wasteful spending. Take the huge new airport in Luliang, which opened with barely five flights a day, or the Olympic Bird\u2019s Nest stadium, so underused that it is now more a monument than a venue. Although the adage \u201cbuild and the people will come\u201d has often proved correct in the past, the Chinese government is worried. After the National Bureau of Statistics found 450 sq km of unsold residential floor space, the country\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, called for the \u201cannihilation\u201d of excess developments. Empty, crumbling structures are not just an eyesore, but a drain on the economy and a waste of productive land. Ever greater construction requires ever more cement and steel factories, discharging ever more pollution and carbon dioxide. As the Chinese landscape architect Yu Kongjian has pointed out, it also suffocates the ecosystems \u2013 fertile soil, self-cleansing streams, storm-resisting mangrove swamps, flood-preventing forests \u2013 on which human beings ultimately depend. It is a threat to what he calls \u201ceco-security\u201d. Yu has led the charge against concrete, ripping it up whenever possible to restore riverbanks and natural vegetation. In his influential book The Art of Survival, he warns that China has moved dangerously far from Taoist ideals of harmony with nature. \u201cThe urbanisation process we follow today is a path to death,\u201d he has said. Yu has been consulted by government officials, who are increasingly aware of the brittleness of the current Chinese model of growth. But their scope for movement is limited. The initial momentum of a concrete economy is always followed by inertia in concrete politics. The president has promised a shift of economic focus away from belching heavy industries and towards high-tech production in order to create a \u201cbeautiful country\u201d and an \u201cecological civilisation\u201d, and the government is now trying to wind down from the biggest construction boom in human history, but Xi cannot let the construction sector simply fade away, because it employs more than 55 million workers \u2013 almost the entire population of the UK. Instead, China is doing what countless other nations have done, exporting its environmental stress and excess capacity overseas. Beijing\u2019s much-vaunted Belt and Road Initiative \u2013 an overseas infrastructure investment project many times greater than the Marshall Plan \u2013 promises a splurge of roads in Kazakhstan, at least 15 dams in Africa, railways in Brazil and ports in Pakistan, Greece and Sri Lanka. To supply these and other projects, China National Building Material \u2013 the country\u2019s biggest cement producer \u2013 has announced plans to construct 100 cement factories across 50 nations. * * * This will almost certainly mean more criminal activity. As well as being the primary vehicle for super-charged national building, the construction industry is also the widest channel for bribes. In many countries, the correlation is so strong, people see it as an index: the more concrete, the more corruption. According to the watchdog group Transparency International, construction is the world\u2019s dirtiest business, far more prone to graft than mining, real estate, energy or the arms market. No country is immune, but in recent years, Brazil has revealed most clearly the jawdropping scale of bribery in the industry. As elsewhere, the craze for concrete in South America\u2019s biggest nation started benignly enough as a means of social development, then morphed into an economic necessity, and finally metastasised into a tool for political expediency and individual greed. The progress between these stages was impressively rapid. The first huge national project in the late 1950s was the construction of a new capital, Bras\u00edlia, on an almost uninhabited plateau in the interior. A million cubic metres of concrete were poured on the highlands site in just 41 months to encase the soil and erect new edifices for ministries and homes. This was followed by a new highway through the Amazon rainforest \u2013 the TransAmazonia \u2013 and then from 1970, South America\u2019s biggest hydroelectric power plant, the Itaipu on the Paran\u00e1 river border with Paraguay, which is almost four times bulkier than the Hoover Dam. The Brazilian operators boast the 12.3m cubic metres of concrete would be enough to fill 210 Maracan\u00e3 stadiums. This was a world record until China\u2019s Three Gorges Dam choked the Yangtze with 27.2m cubic metres. With the military in power, the press censored and no independent judiciary, there was no way of knowing how much of the budget was siphoned off by the generals and contractors. But the problem of corruption has become all too apparent since 1985 in the post-dictatorship era, with virtually no party or politician left untainted. For many years, the most notorious of them was Paulo Maluf, the governor of S\u00e3o Paulo, who had run the city during the construction of the giant elevated expressway known as Minhoc\u00e3o, which means Big Worm. As well as taking credit for this project, which opened in 1969, he also allegedly skimmed $1bn from public works in just four years, part of which has been traced to secret accounts in the British Virgin islands. Although wanted by Interpol, Maluf evaded justice for decades and was elected to a number of senior public offices. This was thanks to a high degree of public cynicism encapsulated by the phrase most commonly used about him: \u201cHe steals, but he gets things done\u201d \u2013 which could describe much of the global concrete industry. But his reputation as the most corrupt man in Brazil has been overshadowed in the past five years by Operation Car Wash, an investigation into a vast network of bid-rigging and money laundering. Giant construction firms \u2013 notably Odebrecht, Andrade Gutierrez and Camargo Corr\u00eaa \u2013 were at the heart of this sprawling scheme, which saw politicians, bureaucrats and middle-men receive at least $2bn worth of kickbacks in return for hugely inflated contracts for oil refineries, the Belo Monte dam, the 2014 World Cup, the 2016 Olympics and dozens of other infrastructure projects throughout the region. Prosecutors said Odebrecht alone had paid bribes to 415 politicians and 26 political parties. As a result of these revelations, one government fell, a former president of Brazil and the vice president of Ecuador are in prison, the president of Peru was forced to resign, and dozens of other politicians and executives were put behind bars. The corruption scandal also reached Europe and Africa. The US Department of Justice called it \u201cthe largest foreign bribery case in history\u201d. It was so huge that when Maluf was finally arrested in 2017, nobody batted an eyelid. * * * Such corruption is not just a theft of tax revenue, it is a motivation for environmental crime: billions of tonnes of CO2 pumped into the atmosphere for projects of dubious social value and often pushed through \u2013 as in the case of Belo Monte \u2013 against the opposition of affected local residents and with deep concerns among environmental licensing authorities. Although the dangers are increasingly apparent, this pattern continues to repeat itself. India and Indonesia are just entering their high-concrete phase of development. Over the next 40 years, the newly built floor area in the world is expected to double. Some of that will bring health benefits. The environmental scientist Vaclav Smil estimates the replacement of mud floors with concrete in the world\u2019s poorest homes could cut parasitic diseases by nearly 80%. But each wheelbarrow of concrete also tips the world closer to ecological collapse. Chatham House predicts urbanisation, population growth and economic development will push global cement production from 4 to 5bn tonnes a year. If developing countries expand their infrastructure to current average global levels, the construction sector will emit 470 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide by 2050, according to the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate. This violates the Paris agreement on climate change, under which every government in the world agreed that annual carbon emissions from the cement industry should fall by at least 16% by 2030 if the world is to reach the target of staying within 1.5C to 2C of warming. It also puts a crushing weight on the ecosystems that are essential for human wellbeing. The dangers are recognised. A report last year by Chatham House calls for a rethink in the way cement is produced. To reduce emissions, it urges greater use of renewables in production, improved energy efficiency, more substitutes for clinker and, most important, the widespread adoption of carbon capture and storage technology \u2013 though this is expensive and has not yet been deployed in the industry on a commercial scale. Architects believe the answer is to make buildings leaner and, when possible, to use other materials, such as cross-laminated timber. It is time to move out of the \u201cconcrete age\u201d and stop thinking primarily about how a building looks, said Anthony Thistleton. \u201cConcrete is beautiful and versatile but, unfortunately, it ticks all the boxes in terms of environmental degradation,\u201d he told the Architects Journal. \u201cWe have a responsibility to think about all the materials we are using and their wider impact.\u201d But many engineers argue that there is no viable alternative. Steel, asphalt and plasterboard are more energy intensive than concrete. The world\u2019s forests are already being depleted at an alarming rate even without a surge in extra demand for timber. Phil Purnell, a professor of materials and structures at Leeds University, said the world was unlikely to reach a \u201cpeak concrete\u201d moment. \u201cThe raw materials are virtually limitless and it will be in demand for as long as we build roads, bridges and anything else that needs a foundation,\u201d he said. \u201cBy almost any measure it\u2019s the least energy-hungry of all materials.\u201d Instead, he calls for existing structures to be better maintained and conserved, and, when that is not possible, to enhance recycling. Currently most concrete goes to landfill sites or is crushed and reused as aggregate. This could be done more efficiently, Purnell said, if slabs were embedded with identification tags that would allow the material to be matched with demand. His colleagues at Leeds University are also exploring alternatives to Portland cement. Different mixes can reduce the carbon footprint of a binder by up to two-thirds, they say. Arguably more important still is a change of mindset away from a developmental model that replaces living landscapes with built environments and nature-based cultures with data-driven economies. That requires tackling power structures that have been built on concrete, and recognising that fertility is a more reliable base for growth than solidity.

Opposition councillors have described the drop as a \u201cdeliberate misrepresentation\u201d of the scale of rough sleeping in the area.</p> <p>Conservative councillor Robert Nemeth at Brighton council said: \u201cPhysically counting produces lower figures as it will always be the case that not every rough sleeper can be found on any given night. This happened in November 2018 when the count was conveniently carried out when it was snowing. It produced a figure that was under half of what the city\u2019s rough-sleeping campaigners estimated as the real number.\u201d</p> <p>In Southend-on-Sea, there was officially an 85% reduction in rough sleeping from 2017 to 2018, according to the most recent figures, from 72 to 11 people, following a change in the counting method. Local charities have questioned the validity of the figure.</p> <p>Authorities in Redbridge, Eastbourne, Medway, Worthing, Thanet, Exeter, Basildon, Ipswich, Warwick and Gloucester all reported big falls in rough sleeping from 2017 to 2018 after switching from reporting an estimate to a street count.</p> <p>Homeless charities have long felt the official figures fail to capture the true scale of rough sleeping in England. Last December, Crisis estimated that more than 22,000 people in England would spend the festive period sleeping rough or in cars, trains, buses or tents, more than four times the official figure of 4,677 for 2018.</p> <p>The accuracy of official rough sleeping statistics is important as central government uses the figures to allocate funding and make policy decisions about how to best tackle the homelessness crisis in England.</p> <p>Concerns have previously been raised about the number of local authorities that reported having no rough sleepers in the official figures for England, which rose for the third consecutive year in 2018, including homelessness hotspots such as Gosport, Hampshire.</p> <p>When contacted by the Guardian, several local authorities that changed from reporting an estimate to a street count said they had been advised to do so by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government after receiving money through the Rough Sleeper Initiative, a short-term fund aimed at reducing rough sleeping in the most affected areas.</p> <p>Homeless Link, which is paid by the central government to guide councils on collating rough sleeping statistics and officially verify the count, said local authorities are free to choose to do a count or an estimate each year.</p> <p>In response to the figures, minister for homelessness MP said: \u201cThese claims are an insult to the hardworking outreach workers, local charities, and other groups that collate these figures and are independently verified by Homeless Link.</p> <p>\u201cThe rough sleeping count uses a well-established method \u2013 adopted by many cities across the world \u2013 providing us with a reliable way of comparing change over time, and councils have the freedom to choose how they conduct their count to best suit their area and individual circumstances.</p> <p>\u201cWe have set out bold plans to end rough sleeping \u2013 and these figures show our work is already making a difference.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Absolute rubbish\u2019</strong></h2> <p>It is a mild afternoon in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, and Mike, a 57-year-old rough sleeper, is watching the half-term chaos pass him by on the bustling high street. Just hours before, Theresa May congratulated the borough council on an apparent 85% reduction in rough sleeping in just 12 months. Officially, the number of rough sleepers in the area, which also includes nearby Westcliff-on-Sea and Shoeburyness, plummeted from 72 people in 2017 to just 11 in 2018. But nobody who works with Southend\u2019s street population is convinced by the official figures, let alone the rough sleepers themselves.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolute rubbish,\u201d chuckles Mike, a former paramedic who suffers with a terminal respiratory illness. Like many coastal towns at the end of a train line, Southend and the surrounding communities have felt the brunt of England\u2019s homelessness crisis. Shelters and churches are full throughout the winter, soups kitchens regularly feed around 40 people in Southend alone, and the high street is punctuated by sleeping bags and piles of cardboard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a54a3adf4dd0a876a99932a30e5069ab07f654f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a54a3adf4dd0a876a99932a30e5069ab07f654f/0_168_5032_3019/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Homeless people asleep on the streets of Southend-on-sea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Homeless people asleep on the streets of Southend-on-sea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penelope Barritt/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2017, the borough had the ninth highest rough-sleeping population in England, according to government statistics.

      "bodyText": "Councils have been accused of deliberately hiding the scale of the rough sleeping crisis in England by changing the way they compiled figures for the 2018 official count, the Guardian can reveal. Official government statistics reported a 2% fall in rough sleeping in England in 2018 after seven consecutive years of rises when the figures were released last month. But critics have suggested the percentage decreased after several councils changed their counting method and does not reflect the reality on the streets. The government has described the claims as \u201can insult\u201d to the volunteers and charities who help compile the official figures. But back in 2015 the figures were also criticised as low-quality, untrustworthy and vulnerable to political manipulation by the UK Statistics Authority who threatened to remove their official status. The rough sleeping statistics for England, based on a combination of estimates and spot counts on a single night in autumn, are intended to include everyone about to bed down or already bedded down on the street, in doorways, parks, tents and sheds but not hostels or shelters. Estimates, akin to a local census, are typically agreed by agencies who work closely with rough sleepers in the area all year round, whereas street counts are one-night snapshots. Analysis by the Guardian found that more than 30 councils switched from submitting an estimate to a street count from 2017 to 2018, with some councils reporting reductions in rough sleeping of up to 85%. In Brighton and Hove, the official number for rough sleepers fell from 178 to 64 people in 12 months after the council made the change. Opposition councillors have described the drop as a \u201cdeliberate misrepresentation\u201d of the scale of rough sleeping in the area. Conservative councillor Robert Nemeth at Brighton council said: \u201cPhysically counting produces lower figures as it will always be the case that not every rough sleeper can be found on any given night. This happened in November 2018 when the count was conveniently carried out when it was snowing. It produced a figure that was under half of what the city\u2019s rough-sleeping campaigners estimated as the real number.\u201d In Southend-on-Sea, there was officially an 85% reduction in rough sleeping from 2017 to 2018, according to the most recent figures, from 72 to 11 people, following a change in the counting method. Local charities have questioned the validity of the figure. Authorities in Redbridge, Eastbourne, Medway, Worthing, Thanet, Exeter, Basildon, Ipswich, Warwick and Gloucester all reported big falls in rough sleeping from 2017 to 2018 after switching from reporting an estimate to a street count. Homeless charities have long felt the official figures fail to capture the true scale of rough sleeping in England. Last December, Crisis estimated that more than 22,000 people in England would spend the festive period sleeping rough or in cars, trains, buses or tents, more than four times the official figure of 4,677 for 2018. The accuracy of official rough sleeping statistics is important as central government uses the figures to allocate funding and make policy decisions about how to best tackle the homelessness crisis in England. Concerns have previously been raised about the number of local authorities that reported having no rough sleepers in the official figures for England, which rose for the third consecutive year in 2018, including homelessness hotspots such as Gosport, Hampshire. When contacted by the Guardian, several local authorities that changed from reporting an estimate to a street count said they had been advised to do so by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government after receiving money through the Rough Sleeper Initiative, a short-term fund aimed at reducing rough sleeping in the most affected areas. Homeless Link, which is paid by the central government to guide councils on collating rough sleeping statistics and officially verify the count, said local authorities are free to choose to do a count or an estimate each year. In response to the figures, minister for homelessness MP said: \u201cThese claims are an insult to the hardworking outreach workers, local charities, and other groups that collate these figures and are independently verified by Homeless Link. \u201cThe rough sleeping count uses a well-established method \u2013 adopted by many cities across the world \u2013 providing us with a reliable way of comparing change over time, and councils have the freedom to choose how they conduct their count to best suit their area and individual circumstances. \u201cWe have set out bold plans to end rough sleeping \u2013 and these figures show our work is already making a difference.\u201d \u2018Absolute rubbish\u2019 It is a mild afternoon in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, and Mike, a 57-year-old rough sleeper, is watching the half-term chaos pass him by on the bustling high street. Just hours before, Theresa May congratulated the borough council on an apparent 85% reduction in rough sleeping in just 12 months. Officially, the number of rough sleepers in the area, which also includes nearby Westcliff-on-Sea and Shoeburyness, plummeted from 72 people in 2017 to just 11 in 2018. But nobody who works with Southend\u2019s street population is convinced by the official figures, let alone the rough sleepers themselves. \u201cAbsolute rubbish,\u201d chuckles Mike, a former paramedic who suffers with a terminal respiratory illness. Like many coastal towns at the end of a train line, Southend and the surrounding communities have felt the brunt of England\u2019s homelessness crisis. Shelters and churches are full throughout the winter, soups kitchens regularly feed around 40 people in Southend alone, and the high street is punctuated by sleeping bags and piles of cardboard. In 2017, the borough had the ninth highest rough-sleeping population in England, according to government statistics. A year later, Southend is not even in the top 100. But that\u2019s not the full story. Every year since 2010, with the exception of 2014, Southend borough council submitted a figure based on an estimate, akin to a local census, of its rough sleeping population agreed by agencies that are in regular contact with the area\u2019s homeless. Rough sleeping surged, from just eight in 2010 to 72 in 2017, notwithstanding a dip in 2014. But last year, the council changed its methodology and submitted a street count of rough sleepers seen on one especially cold night in late November.

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has promised to help accelerate the construction of a new interconnector between Tasmania and the mainland, and has signalled the government will back the Snowy 2.0 expansion as part of the Coalition\u2019s climate policy reboot. The prime minister confirmed on Monday the government would spend $56m in an effort to progress a new 1,200MW interconnector as part of Tasmania\u2019s \u201cbattery of the nation\u201d project and he also sent a strong hint he will back Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s pet project, adding 2,000MW of new generation capacity at Snowy Hydro. The Tasmanian project is a plan to double the state\u2019s renewable energy capacity by developing pumped hydro energy storage, building windfarms and upgrading existing generation assets. Fourteen pumped hydro sites have been earmarked across the state with a combined potential generation capacity of up to 4,800 megawatts. Under the plan, renewable energy would be exported to the mainland if a planned second interconnector goes ahead. The additional generation projects and transmission infrastructure, as well as potential action to assist the rollout of electric vehicles, were flagged during a speech in Melbourne in which Morrison promised to rebadge and top up funding for the existing emissions reduction fund to the tune of $2bn over 10 years as part of a climate policy pivot. The prime minister, who has faced internal pressure from MPs to give them something constructive to sell to voters on climate change, said the government was committed to addressing the challenge, and insisted a package of measures will ensure Australia meets its commitments under the Paris climate agreement. One of the measures the government has factored in to help meet the 2030 target is a 367 megatonne abatement from carry-over credits (an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030). The government\u2019s policy shift was panned by Labor, the Greens, a range of climate experts and environmental groups. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said Labor would scrap the fund if it won the next federal election. \u201cThis has been their policy for the last five years, with exactly the same annual amount put into it as Scott Morrison has promised for the future, and yet we\u2019ve seen carbon pollution go up year upon year, projected to continue to go up all the way to 2030,\u201d Butler said on Monday. \u201cThis is a failed policy\u201d. Bill Hare, a climate scientist and the director of Climate Analytics, said the emissions reduction fund was \u201ca failed policy\u201d, with all independent analysis showing it had not reduced emissions to the extent the government claimed. \u201cThey certainly have not shown up in the national emissions, which continue to increase,\u201d he said. Hare said the amount of annual funding proposed by Morrison halved what the original policy provided under Abbott. He said the government had also taken no steps to rectify problems with the scheme, including that emitters were currently able to use the safeguard mechanism to increase their emissions. \u201cThe bigger issue is there\u2019s no way the Australian taxpayer can pay for the emissions reductions needed, and nor should they,\u201d Hare said. \u201cThe polluter-pays principle needs to be applied and that means a carbon pricing system would enable companies to make an investment in their production that would benefit taxpayers and the bottom line.\u201d The Australian Conservation Foundation said the emissions reduction fund had done nothing to cut carbon pollution since its introduction and it was difficult to see how continuing with the same policy would lead to a different result. \u201cThere are serious questions about the governance, effectiveness and value for money of the emissions reduction fund that a new name won\u2019t fix,\u201d Gavan McFadzean, the ACF\u2019s climate change and clean energy program director, said. \u201cA responsible climate policy must include a whole-of-government and whole-economy approach to reducing pollution, but today\u2019s announcement contains nothing about the energy sector or transport or agriculture or major industry \u2013 nothing about cutting pollution from the most polluting parts of our economy.\u201d Neneh Darwin, a campaigner at Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said topping up the fund was a choice by the government to do \u201cas close to nothing\u201d on climate policy as possible. \u201cFirst step in fixing the climate crisis is powering past coal \u2013 but the government is doing every single thing it can think of to delay that, including trying to actively prop up the industry by throwing as much taxpayer money at it as they can\u201d, Darwin said. The Investor Group on Climate Change, which has been focused on the financial risks associated with climate change, said by continuing with the same policy the government was not addressing the serious economic risks climate change exposed Australia to. \u201cThere is a significant gap between the government\u2019s current target and the objectives of the Paris agreement. This is of great concern for investors, as global warming above 1.5-2C would have large and detrimental impacts on global economies, society and investment portfolios,\u201d the group\u2019s chief executive Emma Herd said. Herd said the government needed to close the gap between its long-term Paris commitments and the current policies urgently. She said investors were increasingly worried about climate change and would keep pushing governments to adopt policies that enabled a smooth transition to a net zero emissions economy. \u201cThe government\u2019s support for investigation into stronger network connection with Tasmania and large scale energy storage is important,\u201d she said. \u201cThis work should be undertaken in the context of the energy market operator\u2019s Integrated System Plan and embedded within a strategy to achieve net zero emissions in the electricity sector.\u201d",

Mark Lee, a Fair Work Ombudsman employee who also occasionally worked for the union regulator, told the federal court on Monday he did not mention the police search warrants in a phone conversation with Cash\u2019s then chief of staff, Ben Davies, on 24 October 2017. Davies had previously told the court that while the pair were organising plans for Lee to start work in Cash\u2019s office, Lee had \u201cvolunteered\u201d that police were going to raid the union\u2019s offices later that afternoon. But under cross-examination from the AWU\u2019s lawyer, Herman Borenstein, Lee repeatedly denied telling Davies about the raids. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been me,\u201d Lee told the civil trial. \u201cI didn\u2019t know when the raids were going to take place, I didn\u2019t know the locations, I didn\u2019t know the warrants had been issued.

The AWU is seeking to quash an ROC investigation into donations made to GetUp while Bill Shorten was its leader. The union cites letters from Cash referring the matters and from her staff leaking news of the raids as proof that the investigation was politically motivated. On day seven of the civil trial, Lee told the court he had learned from the ROC\u2019s media adviser, Greg Russo, that the regulator was seeking search warrants from federal police. But he said he had never found out that the warrants were successfully obtained. He said he had left work earlier that day and had learned that media were present for the raids only when he began getting questions about it from journalists the following day. Asked if he believed the dissemination of news about the warrants could prejudice the ROC\u2019s investigation, he said: \u201cI had no reason to think it would be distributed in advance.\u201d Later, Borenstein showed Lee his statement to police in which he did not mention his phone call with Davies. \u201cI suggest to you that you deliberately excluded mention of that phone call because you were concerned it would incriminate you,\u201d Borenstein said. Lee said he had not mentioned the conversation to police because he had already provided his phone records and believed they were aware of the call. He said he had also informed his superiors at the Fair Work Ombudsman about that call. The court heard Lee then went on to contact ROC senior official Chris Enright to dispute claims aired in Senate estimates that he had been the source of the leak.

Tonight is not just the highlight of the cinematic year, but it might just be the highlight of the year full stop, for the simple reason that it might just be a full-blown car crash.<br><br>There\u2019s no host, every one of the Academy\u2019s proposed changes to modernise the ceremony has gone down in flames, it\u2019s been snowing in Los Angeles and there\u2019s a general sense of jeopardy not seen since Rob Lowe duetted with Snow White 30 years ago.</p> \n  <p>To add to the excitement, for the first time ever, nobody knows who\u2019s going to win anything. Frontrunners are scattered all over the place, and the results of the big prizes are anyone\u2019s guess, frankly.<br></p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s how tonight will proceed. From now until 1am, I\u2019ll be tag-teaming the Oscars red carpet with the fashion team. And then, when the ceremony itself starts at 1am GMT, I\u2019ll be bringing you all the action as it happens, either until it finishes or until the sun expands and swallows the Earth. It\u2019s a long ceremony, is what I\u2019m trying to say. All the while, why not play along with this Oscars Bingo game? </p> \n  <p>If you\u2019re in America, it\u2019s going to be a fun evening. If you\u2019re British, go to bed. All the good bits will be on YouTube tomorrow morning. Sleep is important, you know.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c67434195cfe488cb00ff5bf99652d44fe6c36a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c67434195cfe488cb00ff5bf99652d44fe6c36a/0_0_5354_3213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guardian Oscars bingo card 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guardian Oscars bingo card 2019</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Rex</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-25T05:01:56.279Z\">at 5.01am GMT</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s that for another year. What a strange one, eh? On the bad side, some less than wonderful films snuck through under the wire. On the plus side, at least it was quite short. The Guardian didn\u2019t win, but Olivia Colman did, so at least one beloved institution made it. Don\u2019t expect much from the ratings tomorrow; there was no host or clear frontrunner for an audience to coalesce around. But right now that doesn\u2019t matter. The important thing is that we were here. We did it! Now, for God\u2019s sake, let\u2019s all go to sleep. Here\u2019s more about Green Book\u2019s unexpected win. This is a strange choice for a best picture win. But it ends with the mic getting cut off in the middle of the speech, so at least we still got some of that characteristic Oscar cack-handedness. GREEN BOOK WINS BEST PICTURE. Also a shock, although a slightly less delightful one than best actress. One more award left tonight. Anyone could win it. This is tense. More on Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s win here. ALFONSO CUAR\u00d3N WINS BEST DIRECTOR FOR ROMA. His third speech of the night, and surely he\u2019s got nobody else to thank. Surely. And yet, no. Cast, crew, producers, studio, Netflix and literally just people he happens to be looking at all get thanked. He then reads a speech in defence of domestic workers. He finishes the speech in Spanish. Maybe it\u2019s a Colman hangover, or maybe I\u2019m tired, but I found it quite moving. Guillermo del Toro is here to present best director, despite having a tremendous fever. Hero after hero tonight. And here, in a tweet, is a nice summary of the British reaction: Here, in a tweet, is America discovering Olivia Colman: Here\u2019s more on Olivia Colman\u2019s win. I\u2019d only just got used to her being a national treasure. She\u2019s an international treasure now. Colman looks like she wasn\u2019t expecting this either. She\u2019s flabbergasted. \u201cThis is not going to happen again,\u201d she says. She blows a raspberry at the \u201cWrap up\u201d sign. She points at Lady Gaga and says: \u201cLady Gaga.\u201d How fantastic. What a brilliant moment. Everyone thought that Glenn Close was a lock for this, but here she is. Brilliant Olivia Colman. \u201cIt\u2019s genuinely quite stressful. This is hilarious. I\u2019ve got an Oscar,\u201d she sobs. OLIVIA COLMAN WINS BEST ACTRESS. What a brilliant shock! Congressman John Lewis is here to discuss Green Book. He speaks with gravitas and emotion, and it\u2019s one of the most powerful moments of the night. More on Rami Malek\u2019s win here. RAMI MALEK WINS BEST ACTOR. He gets on stage and calls his mother a \u201clovely lady\u201d, does a bit of humblebragging, thanks Queen, stammers charmingly about what he was like as a child and generally pretends that Bryan Singer was just a figment of everyone\u2019s imagination. Alison Janney and Gary Oldman are on stage, telling the worst joke in all of history. But anyway, best actor time! Barbra Streisand is here to discuss BlacKkKlansman now. She\u2019s discussing its artistry, and the importance of emotional truth in film-making. But forget that, because Richard E Grant is going ABSOLUTELY BONKERS. His eyes have gone googly. He\u2019s clutching his heart. His jaw is slack. Actually, can someone just check that he isn\u2019t having a coronary? This might be the image that everyone remembers from tonight. Find yourself a person who looks at you like Lady Gaga realising that Bradley Cooper\u2019s face is a bit too close for her liking. Smart of the presenter to mention that they weren\u2019t going to name all the dead people in this package. This way, if they forget someone, it isn\u2019t an accidental snub. It\u2019s fully deliberate. So that\u2019s something. Now for the In Memoriam segment. If you\u2019ll allow me to reuse a joke from the Bafta liveblog, here\u2019s where we will all pay our respects to Liam Neeson\u2019s career. Gaga\u2019s up first, already in floods of tears. She\u2019s explaining how hard it is to be successful. It\u2019s deeply, deeply emotional. And then Mark Ronson thanks Lady Gaga, and then everyone has to help her off the stage like she\u2019s their drunk best friend. Wonderful. SHALLOW WINS BEST ORIGINAL SONG. Boy oh boy, this is going to be a speech. BLACK PANTHER WINS BEST ORIGINAL SCORE. Ludwig Goransson accepts the award, and that\u2019s about it. But still, Black Panther is stealthily doing very well this year. They won\u2019t play him off. Spike Lee is speaking from the heart, and the audience is lapping it up. The speech ends, but I get the feeling that the Oscars jumped in and cut him off at a natural applause break. He doesn\u2019t seem to mind either way. BLACKkKLANSMAN WINS BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY. Samuel L Jackson is elated. Spike Lee is elated. This might just be the most effusive reaction to a win all night. \u201cDO NOT TURN THE MOTHERFUCKING CLOCK ON,\u201d screams Lee, before pulling two folded sheets of A4 out of his pocket. Now it\u2019s a game of chicken between Lee and the Oscars. There are three writers on stage. One of them is a blabbermouth. The other two can stay. GREEN BOOK WINS BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY. And if there\u2019s ever a speech doomed to be played off, this is it. Samuel L Jackson and Brie Larson are here to present best original screenplay. And they\u2019re giggling a lot. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re desperate to prove their chemistry for an upcoming blockbuster or something. SKIN WINS BEST LIVE ACTION SHORT. The stage has gone bananas! People are screaming! People are taking selfies! People are, um, earnestly discussing the Holocaust. And now they\u2019re screaming again. This is the most tonally diverse speech of the night, if nothing else. Please someone give Bradley Cooper an Oscar for Most Difficulty Suppressing An Air Guitar Workout. It\u2019s just the pair of them singing at each other. Lots of pauses. Nice and intimate. And it\u2019s got that bit where Lady Gaga makes the same noise that I do when I walk over my kid\u2019s Lego without any shoes on. Everyone\u2019s a winner, basically. And now Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga lead each other up to the stage to sing Shallow together. This is likely to be A Moment, so look out. FIRST MAN WINS BEST VISUAL EFFECTS. Remember when everyone thought that First Man would win all the Oscars? Joke\u2019s on you, First Man. Should have had more funny granny teeth in it. That seems to be the thing that gets you Oscars this year. In terms of categories, we\u2019re just about halfway through the ceremony. It\u2019s supposed to be finished in an hour. This show is going to WILDLY OVERRUN. Period. End of Sentence is available for you to watch on Netflix now, by the way. And here\u2019s Black Sheep, which didn\u2019t win but is still very good. We\u2019re now in the Oscars green room, which appears to be made from an escape pod from a middle-era Star Trek film. Futuristic! And all for nothing, because PERIOD. END OF SENTENCE WINS BEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT. It\u2019s a very good short, about a very important subject. Ah well, maybe next year. Documentary short now. Very weird tension in the office now. BAO WINS BEST ANIMATED SHORT. Instead of saying something pithy here, I\u2019ll just show you the film. It\u2019s really wonderful. Here\u2019s Awkwafina and John Mulaney to present something. Doesn\u2019t matter what, because this is the best moment of the night so far. Let them present the whole thing next year. Remember that Bohemian Rhapsody bit from Wayne\u2019s World? The Oscars does, because Dana Carvey and Mike Myers are here to discuss Bohemian Rhapsody. Fun fact: Wayne\u2019s World was actually a good film. I\u2019ve just had a look on Twitter to see how I\u2019m doing. although on the other hand I\u2019m really walking a tightrope here, guys. More about the Spider-Man win here. And now a performance of When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings from The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, a song with such a long name from a film with such a long name that it\u2019s pretty much over by the time I\u2019ve finished typing it out. More on Mahershala Ali\u2019s win here. SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDERVERSE WINS BEST ANIMATED FEATURE. And rightly so. It might actually be the best film nominated tonight. How fantastic. And how fantastic that Lord and Miller won an Oscar and Solo didn\u2019t. Pharrell is here to quote from the Bible. Must be time for best animated feature film! Back to Bohemian Rhapsody, which contained this scene and still won best editing. Look at this scene. It\u2019s the best editing Oscar, guys, not the most editing Oscar. MAHERSHALA ALI WINS BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR. And, with that, Richard E Grant can finally relax and stop enjoying every single thing he ever encounters. Go ahead, Richard. Go and shout at a printer or something. It\u2019s cathartic. Daniel Craig and Charlize Theron present best supporting actor now. Nobody from Bohemian Rhapsody is nominated, but I\u2019m honestly quite worried that someone from Bohemian Rhapsody will win. BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY WINS BEST EDITING. What the hell is going on? Michael Keaton is presenting best editing. Michael Keaton, who w an Oscar for a film with no visible edits. Up is down and down is up. Trevor Noah is here, to discuss Black Panther. Or, more specifically, he\u2019s discussing how he personally relates to Black Panther. At this rate, I\u2019m worried that they\u2019re going to get Liam Neeson on to discuss BlacKkKlansman. The Place Where Lost Things Go? Hey, maybe there\u2019s a verse about my will to live, am I right? Midler is singing The Place Where Lost Things Go from Mary Poppins Returns. It is adequate. Keegan Michael Key drops out of the sky holding an umbrella, to introduce Bette Midler singing a Mary Poppins song. He can\u2019t collapse the umbrella either, which I\u2019m also taking as a Trump reference. ROMA WINS BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM. Cuar\u00f3n takes the stage again, and finds some more people to thank. There\u2019s another veiled Trump reference, and he\u2019s off before the music starts. What a pro. Angela Bassett and Javier Bardem are presenting. Bardem is presenting in Spanish, with subtitles. If you\u2019re taking this as a subtle Trump dig, go ahead and cross it off your bingo card. Queen Latifah is now discussing The Favourite. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy being a queen,\u201d she says. THE PATTERN HOLDS. I\u2019ve been specifically asked not to liveblog anything too British tonight, to pay respect for our large international readership. HOWEVER, it is incredibly weird and gratifying to see Anita Dobson off EastEnders in the Oscars audience. Please, please, let\u2019s get Ian Beale on the red carpet next year. BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY WINS BEST SOUND MIXING So, if anyone\u2019s playing along with the bingo game, feel free to cross off \u2018Bohemian Rhapsody wins more than it deserves.\u2019 BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY WINS BEST SOUND EDITING. Let the big theme of the night \u2013 willing Bryan Singer out of existence \u2013 begin! The speech is a success: it\u2019s like he was never a part of the film at all. James McAvoy is presenting the best sound editing award in the manner of an ASMR YouTuber being driven mad by a ton of bees. Now here\u2019s Serena Williams to discuss A Star Is Born. Like the Rage Against the Machine guy, she\u2019s discussing it through the prism of her own job. I hope this pattern holds throughout the night, with every bone in my body. The song is over already. I\u2019ll give a pound* to anyone who can remember how that song went. *No pounds. Jennifer Hudson is singing now, against a backdrop of words overlaid against the supreme court. It looks, uncannily, like Saul Goodman\u2019s office from Breaking Bad. Emilia Clarke introduced the first nominated song of the night, I\u2019ll Fight from RGB. But not before she makes a Game of Thrones joke. ROMA WINS BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY. This was always going to happen. Whatever queasiness Hollywood might have about giving an award to a Netflix film, there\u2019s no denying that Roma is a beautiful film to look at. If Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n wins anything else tonight he won\u2019t have anyone to thank, because he literally thanked every single person and thing on the face of the planet. No tears, though. They weren\u2019t played off, but boy that speech went on. Don\u2019t expect to get out of here any time soon, folks. Oh, no, I was wrong. BLACK PANTHER WINS BEST PRODUCTION DESIGN. Hannah Beachler reads her speech from her phone, and makes such a faff about it that poor Jay Hart isn\u2019t going to get a word in. Especially since Beachler is sobbing so hard and determined to anchor her speech around an \u2018I\u2019m stronger\u2019 motif that refuses to die. Jennifer Lopez and Chris Evans are here to present production design. My gut feeling is that Jennifer Lopez will win this, because she\u2019s production-designed herself as a sort of crazy-paved mirrorball. I never thought I\u2019d say this, but I\u2019m quite enjoying how businesslike these awards are. No jokes, short presentations, almost no space for speeches. It\u2019s brisk, and the Oscars have never been brisk. Maybe next year they\u2019ll just fire all the trophies at the winners with a cannon. It\u2019d be over in about 45 seconds. Imagine. It\u2019s too early to say for sure, but it feels as if the band strikes up as soon as the winners start to tell us things about their lives. I shall be keeping an eye on this. BLACK PANTHER WINS BEST COSTUME DESIGN. Ruth Carter very cleverly reads her speech from a card that\u2019s the exact same colour as her dress. This is genius sleight of hand. She deserves everything she can get. Played off, too. That\u2019s three in a row. Melissa McCarthy and Brian Tyree Henry are presenting best costume design. McCarthy is wearing a gigantic train covered in toy rabbit and holding a toy rabbit. If nothing else, this ceremony is starting to turn into an audition run for the role of 2020 host. VICE WINS. And this is spectacularly bizarre. The winners are reading from a landscape piece of A4 paper that I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve ever seen before. It\u2019s so bizarre. Nobody knew what they were doing. They\u2019re played off and the speech just sort of crumbles away to nothing. It is AMAZING. Elsie Fisher and Stephan James are presenting BEST MAKEUP AND HAIR. They\u2019re presenting it very briskly indeed. Was this one of the awards they wanted to give out during a commercial? It certainly feels this way. Vice wins And now, coming on to an old Bond theme, is someone from Rage Against the Machine to discuss the film Vice as if it was a piece of guitar feedback. Don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening either. More on Regina King\u2019s win here. There\u2019s an ad break now, so let\u2019s take a moment to reflect on the Oscars set this year. If you haven\u2019t been watching it, it looks like a sort of decoratively ornate jelly mould of a vagina. I hope that helps. FREE SOLO WINS BEST DOCUMENTARY. The creative team cry as well. Quick prediction: this might be the soggiest Oscars ever. You can read the ever-classy Geoff Dyer on Free Solo \u2013 the story of Alex Honnold\u2019s solo and ropeless climb of the 3,000ft vertical wall of El Capitan in Yosemite \u2013 here. BINGO: They\u2019re being played off, and they don\u2019t care. I think I detected a slight note of aggression in the play-off music. Best Documentary now. Helen Mirren and Jason Momoa both turn up in pink, which only makes me wish that Helen Mirren had played Aquaman. Two things of note to mention here. First, King made her speech within the allotted time. Second, BINGO for a dejected Amy Adams cutaway. REGINA KING WINS BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS. She\u2019s immediately set a very high bar for emotion. She started crying straight away, jumped up a level by mentioning her mother, continued crying while mentioning Emma Stone. We cut to Rachel Weisz AND SHE\u2019S CRYING, TOO. Tina Fey, Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph are on stage now, doing a routine about how they\u2019re not the hosts. They\u2019re actually the best supporting actress presenters, but they manage to squeeze in a few good jokes in the interim. Does this mean they\u2019re shipping in old Golden Globes hosts to present? Is Ricky Gervais going to do best film? So it looks like, in lieu of a humorous monologue, we\u2019re getting a montage about how great film is. It\u2019s like the sort of thing they play in cinemas before the film starts, to remind you to buy popcorn and sugary drinks. But this is the Oscars, so it lasts for about 400 years. It ends on a Stan &amp; Ollie clip, teaching us all to add a line about how great films are into our films. Still, at least Brian May is rocking and swaggering with all the confidence of a man who hired an alleged sexual predator to make a film about how great he is. That\u2019s quite a lot of confidence. First it was We Will Rock You. Now they\u2019re doing We Are the Champions, which seems a bit presumptuous given that 80% of the nominees tonight are literally destined to become losers. As expected, the Oscars open with a performance by Queen doing their level best to inject some life into a crowd that\u2019s spent the last fortnight hungry and exhausted. They want this to be over as much as everyone else. Ladies and gentlemen, the 2019 Oscars are about to begin. Strap in, because this is going to be all sorts of stuff. And that\u2019s it from the Guardian fashion team on the red carpet. To surmise, no losers here \u2013 a lot of pink, a lot of capes, a touch of froufrou tulle and trousers, and one incredibly expensive diamond courtesy of Lady Gaga (who else?). Rami Malek, nominated for his role as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, could have gone all out for his red carpet appearance. Instead, he has gone understated and classic. Skinny trousers and sharp tailoring \u2013 a look that will never get old, just like Queen\u2019s back catalogue. Nicholas Hoult, another Brit from The Favourite, is wearing a Dior suit from the autumn/winter 2019 collection. One of the pieces Dior designer Kim Jones made with the red carpet in mind, it comes with a detachable black sash so, you know, you can wear it again. Economical luxury, you heard it here first. Olivia Colman arrived on the red carpet with Lady Gaga \u2013 a friendship we can get behind. Moving on from pink, Colman brings a different shade for your consideration. The forest-green, high-neck dress has none of the flimflam that Colman wears to play Queen Anne in The Favourite. It\u2019s simple, to the point, no nonsense. The train adds a little bit of pizzazz though \u2013 a kind of front-facing cape with sleeves. Is this a red carpet first? A highlight on this current red carpet fashion circuit \u2013 she\u2019s worn Valentino and Celine so far this year \u2013 nominee Lady Gaga has gone for a relatively trad black gown by Alexander McQueen with a small caged crinoline, black latex gloves (another theme) and a 128.54-carats Tiffany yellow diamond, one of the largest in the world, apparently valued at $30m and last worn by Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s. Well, she\u2019s won something even if she doesn\u2019t take home an Oscar. Less than quarter of an hour before things start happening, so be sure to follow our constantly updated list of winners over here. Meanwhile, Olivia Colman has arrived, and appears to have smartly bypassed the gauntlet of the press pack. May she win everything tonight. Have I mentioned that the Guardian is up for an Oscar tonight? Because it is. Look, here\u2019s our head of documentaries Charlie on the red carpet, with Black Sheep\u2019s protagonist Cornelius Walker. Take away the red carpet and Pharrell Williams and his wife Helen Lasichanh could be going out on a date. This is a pretty low-key look for Williams who, with his skater background, has a bit of a thing for shorts, while Lasichanh has tights on, something not often seen on the red carpet. The duo should be admired for their laid-back take on Oscars style \u2013 in a sea of Proper Gowns, they have a refreshing quality: nonchalance. Bucking the trend for hot pink dress and/or a massive train is The Favourite\u2019s Rachel Weisz, who has arrived in a superlative two-part gown \u2013 the top is a cropped red latex T-shirt and the bottom is a tulle embellished skirt with a gently cinched waist. Modern meets historical, much like the film. The Greco-silver headband is straight off the spring/summer catwalk \u2013 expect to see a few more of these ... Seacrest awkwardness update: SAM ELLIOTT: Pressed hard on what Bradley Cooper cooked for him. Refused point-blank to respond. Joke\u2019s on him, because nobody cares. 3/10 Brown is not a colour we have seen much of at the Oscars 2019. It is, however, a very fashion colour currently. Emma Stone, nominated for best supporting actress for her role in The Favourite, makes a case for a kind of rust colour in her Louis Vuitton dress. If, on the catwalk, brown has had a lot of play in daywear with cord and knitwear, Stone\u2019s sequins \u2013 not to mention the impressive matching of hair to dress \u2013 give it a dressy spin. Chadwick Boseman of Black Panther has arrived in a black jacket-dress dipped in metallic sequins, and a thigh-length black silk scarf in lieu of a bowtie. He\u2019s fast becoming a poster boy for Givenchy but we\u2019ll update the designer when we know more. The look is regal, staid without being dull and presumably incredibly heavy. Also very pro anyone who doesn\u2019t wear a harness tonight. Malificent has had quite the impact when it comes to fashion \u2013 Charlize Theron\u2019s Oscars look is the latest example of how the sorceress is a bit of style icon for our times. The actor\u2019s new raven bob looks sharp against the duck-egg column of her Dior dress. The pointy jewellery, slash of red lipstick and low back add up to the kind of glamour that is not to be messed with. Amy Poehler, who would have been a great host tonight but is likely presenting an award, is wearing a black Alberta Ferretti tuxedo, replete with tails, a sheer ruffle blouse and some sort of pin. Tuxedoes on women: the trend we all predicted on the post-MeToo red carpet but have so far seen very little of. In Vice, Amy Adams does power dressing 80s style, complete with shoulder pads, big hair and classically expensive jewellery. For the Oscars, the nominee is far more understated \u2013 strikingly so. After so many pink frocks, capes and more, this white column dress is positively understated. Perhaps it\u2019s a more subtle power play \u2013 when you\u2019re this good, you don\u2019t need to make a fuss. Less than an hour to go until the ceremony starts. It might be time to start guessing what time Lady Gaga will arrive on the red carpet. My prediction: 20 seconds before the ceremony begins, in a gown made out of liquid mercury, carried on a plinth by a fleet of anthropomorphic badgers. In her asymmetric gown by Lebanese designer, Reem Acra, Black Panther star Angela Bassett incorporates three of this season\u2019s trends in one fell swoop: hot pink, a train and a giant rococo bow. Large bows have become something of a macro trend \u2013 see the Miu Miu, Rodarte, Marc Jacobs and Moschino spring/summer catwalks \u2013 but it\u2019s always pleasing to see one worn in the wild. Surprisingly, her stylist described her as a fan of \u201ceffortless fashion\u201d because of the length of the train. Because there isn\u2019t a lot to actually liveblog yet, I\u2019ve chosen to rate the awkwardness of Ryan Seacrest\u2019s red carpet interviews as they happen. Some highlights so far: RICHARD E GRANT: Told Seacrest that he had impregnated Melissa McCarthy, to Seacrest\u2019s palpable confusion. 6/10 JOE ALWYN: Seacrest asked if it was his birthday today. It was not his birthday today. So Seacrest asked what he did for his most recent birthday anyway. 8/10 The sofa print has already had a lot of love on the red carpet \u2013 Harry Styles and Kim Kardashian are fans. Maya Rudolph, best known for her role in the comedy Bridesmaids, joins their ranks with this impressively floral number, which looks like it could be Gucci, and comes with the Oscars 2019 accessory, a cape. People on Twitter are already inevitably comparing it to sofas, but Rudolph should remember, in fashion world, this is not an insult, it\u2019s a compliment. Gemma Chan\u2019s fuschia pink Valentino frock demonstrates she is \u2013 and we mean this as a compliment \u2013 a lazy dresser. The dress has all the impact \u2013 thanks to the kind of colour more usually found on a highlighter in your stationery tidy \u2013 without sacrificing comfort. It has pockets and, with the floor-grazing length, she could even be wearing sneakers. We hope she is. Glenn Close, favourite to win an Oscar for best actress, has come presumably en homage to an Oscar statuette in an extraordinary floor length gold gown. The cape puddling on the red carpet is something of a theme among the best actress nominees \u2013 Melissa McCarthy arrived in a monochrome caped suit a few moments ago. Looking forward to seeing Lady Gaga in something similar. I\u2019ve figured out what a Glambot is, by the way. It\u2019s a high-speed camera mounted on a robotic arm that has the ability to rotate, lift, pan, tilt and roll with unprecedented swiftness. How has E! utilised such impressive technology? By encouraging famous people to sort of stand in front of it and waggle their arms around a bit. Maybe it is the end of the world after all. The trend for women wearing trousers on the red carpet has been growing over the last few years but Melissa McCarthy is the first major female star at the Oscars this year to spurn a dress. Her palazzo pants are very spring/summer 2019. The flowy cape, meanwhile, brings the movie-star glamour. The resemblance to Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s outfits in Game of Thrones only makes us more convinced that McCarthy might actually be queen of the world. If there isn\u2019t going to be an Oscars monologue this year \u2013 rumours suggest that it\u2019s going to be replaced by some sort of hellish Queen medley \u2013 here\u2019s a quick rundown of some of the other awards season monologues, so hopefully you can get your fill that way. Film Independent Spirit awards \u2013 Aubrey Plaza A very strong monologue with good cameos and a splendid closeup of Tilda Swinton\u2019s dirty napkin. 8/10 Writers Guild Awards \u2013 Chelsea Peretti Perhaps the best monologue of the year, possibly because the awards also celebrate television, which meant that a great deal of time could be spent explaining why The Marvelous Mrs Maisel is bad. 10/10 Baftas \u2013 Joanna Lumley Literally a hellmouth created by a near total absence of identifiable jokes. When we all die, this will be the last thing we see. Awful awful awful awful. 3/10 At the 2012 Oscars, Angelina Jolie\u2019s became such a focus of red carpet attention, it gained the ultimate pop culture honour of becoming a meme. Regina King, nominated as best supporting actress for her role in In Beale Street Could Talk, could follow in her footsteps, with a white Oscar de la Renta dress with thigh-high split. Twitter is already calling it a \u201cwinner\u2019s dress\u201d. Time will tell. An early highlight in the arrival of ingenu, Richard E Grant, buoyed no doubt by his win at the Independent Spirit awards this weekend. The awards\u2019 wildcard choice for best supporting actor is wearing a relatively safe red velvet tux jacket with clashing lapels, and, he says, his own scent called \u2018Jack\u2019. Sugar almond shades are making a bid as an early Oscars 2019 red carpet trend. After Emilia Clarke\u2019s ultraviolet, Yalitza Aparicio, who is the first indigenous Mexican person to be nominated for an Oscar \u2013 read Roma star\u2019s hometown wills her on to Oscars glory! \u2013 has taken to an aqua shade. It comes complete with twinkly sparking sequins. As Roma, the film that Aparicio stars in, is filmed in black and white, it\u2019s frankly lovely to see her in colour. The subtle homage to Elsa from Frozen is also appreciated. The sequel to the Disney smash does come out this year, after all. Director Spike Lee, whose film BlacKkKlansman is nominated for best picture and best adapted screenplay, arrives in a millefeuille of papal purple by pioneering black designer, Oswald Boateng (the colour was also big at Gucci and Louis Vuitton this season), and gold Air Jordan 3 \u201cTinker\u201d trainers embellished with the name of his film company. Sort of like a billboard then. Note he wore something similar to the Baftas, with a different hat. For those under any doubt as to whether there is a Prince connection, he\u2019s also wearing a bespoke necklace by Amedeo Scognamiglio in homage to the late popstar. Apparently the \u2018Love Hate\u2019 rings are an homage to his 1990 film, Do The Right Thing, which was famously snubbed at the time. If this liveblog falls silent for any significant periods of time, it\u2019s because I\u2019m watching the E! red carpet coverage and I\u2019ve fallen down a Glambot wormhole. All the presenters keep saying the word \u2018Glambot\u2019 over and over again, and I don\u2019t know what it is. I need to get a definitive answer, otherwise I\u2019ll convince myself that the singularity has happened and E! is leading the onslaught against humanity. More as I get it. In the meantime, here is an article explaining what is going to happen tonight, who we think will win, a quick plug for the Guardian\u2019s Oscar-nominated documentary short Black Sheep (which, not being biased or anything, is VERY GOOD) and another mention of the bingo game. Really cannot reiterate the bingo thing enough, guys. It\u2019s 10, 10, 10, 10 across the board for Billy Porter, the actor seen in Ryan Murphy vogueing series, Pose. Fans of Porter will see his floor-length black gown-plus-tuxedo \u2013 gown-cedo? \u2013 as the next chapter in his bid to win the red carpet. It follows his sequinned and beaded cape plus suit at the Golden Globes and arguably upstages it. The pose itself \u2013 hand on hips, smize at the ready \u2013 means he wins, whatever the category is. Professional declutterer and Netflix star Marie Kondo arrived predictably early, and looking immaculate, in a honeysuckle pink lace gown with floral embellishments by Jenny Packham from her autumn/winter18 pre-Collection. Apparently Kondo tried on three different gowns by the UK designer but ultimately decided that the pink version sparked the most joy. Hi from the fashion desk! Lauren Cochrane and Morwenna Ferrier will be taking you through the style on the red carpet. Emilia Clarke, the actor known for her role in Game of Thrones, is clearly knowledgable about colour theory. Her choice for the Oscars is a strapless gown in Ultraviolet, the colour hotly tipped by Pantone. It seems churlish to point out that this is the colour of 2018, rather than 19, especially because she\u2019s matched the colour so expertly with that sharp bob and plum-coloured lipstick. Living Coral - 2019\u2019s shade - would clash with the red carpet anyway. Hello, and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the 2019 Oscars. Tonight is not just the highlight of the cinematic year, but it might just be the highlight of the year full stop, for the simple reason that it might just be a full-blown car crash. There\u2019s no host, every one of the Academy\u2019s proposed changes to modernise the ceremony has gone down in flames, it\u2019s been snowing in Los Angeles and there\u2019s a general sense of jeopardy not seen since Rob Lowe duetted with Snow White 30 years ago. To add to the excitement, for the first time ever, nobody knows who\u2019s going to win anything. Frontrunners are scattered all over the place, and the results of the big prizes are anyone\u2019s guess, frankly. Here\u2019s how tonight will proceed. From now until 1am, I\u2019ll be tag-teaming the Oscars red carpet with the fashion team. And then, when the ceremony itself starts at 1am GMT, I\u2019ll be bringing you all the action as it happens, either until it finishes or until the sun expands and swallows the Earth. It\u2019s a long ceremony, is what I\u2019m trying to say. All the while, why not play along with this Oscars Bingo game? If you\u2019re in America, it\u2019s going to be a fun evening. If you\u2019re British, go to bed. All the good bits will be on YouTube tomorrow morning. Sleep is important, you know.",

      "bodyText": "The first time Emanuele Sibillo was arrested he was 15: the police raided his house in the Forcella district in Naples while he was trying to get rid of two guns. Sibillo was in and out of prison throughout the following few years. Among the young inmates, he stood out for his ability to command respect and for reading books and newspapers. When he turned 18 in 2013, he prepared for the next big step: rebelling against the old Camorra clans of the Neapolitan mafia to take over the whole city. Since the early 2000s, Italian authorities have arrested hundreds of Camorra bosses and, with the old mobsters either murdered or behind bars, children and young adults such as Sibillo have begun taking their place. The phenomenon was the subject of La Paranza Dei Bambini, a 2016 novel by the Italian writer Roberto Saviano, whose bestselling non-fiction work Gomorrah, published a decade earlier, had shone a light on the Camorra and resulted in him being granted round-the-clock police protection. Paranza translates as a small fishing boat but, in Camorra lingo, it refers to a criminal group led by youngsters or small fish. Saviano refers to these children \u2013 many of whom carry 9mm revolvers by the age of 15 or 16 \u2013 as piranhas. La Paranza dei Bambini was made into a film \u2013 The Piranhas, directed by Claudio Giovannesi \u2013 which won a Silver Bear best screenplay award at this year\u2019s Berlin film festival. The book and film chart the story of Nicola, a boy from the poor Rione Sanit\u00e0 district of Naples, who choses to enter the \u201csystem\u201d, as the Camorra is known.

An Indian man took a bullet in the chest in 2013 when two boys were \u201ctesting their gun\u201d. One young mafia member placed under surveillance was overheard on a wiretap screaming with joy about a new gun. \u201cI have a chrome 357 Magnum with a rubber grip, just like Al Capone\u2019s!,\u201d he said. Last summer, the court of appeal in Naples sentenced 42 members of two paranze from the Forcella and Decumani districts to a combined 500 years in prison. Giovannesi said: \u201cWe wanted to tell the story of these lives. Let\u2019s not forget, these are just teenagers.\u201d While working on the screenplay, he was influenced by great works of literature on adolescence, such as Lord of the Flies, he said. \u201cAll these books touch on the subtle contradiction between playing games and raging war.\u201d Saviano said the the existence of the paranze was partly a product of poor social policies and the failure of state institutions including schools. Giovanni Melillo, the chief prosecutor in Naples, said the gangs were widespread in the city, where young people are recruited based on their ability for violence. \u201cThe clans delegate to them the business of drug dealing and racketeering \u2013 a worrying phenomenon but marginal compared to the [traditional] clan operations of infiltrating public administrations and financial markets,\u201d Melillo said. \u201cBut when the paranze go overboard with raids, the [remaining] older bosses intervene in order to keep the peace.\u201d In 2014, Sibillo was 18 and considered the baby godfather of the Forcella district. A year later, he was dead, the victim of an attack by members of a rival clan.",

The US president said on Sunday night that he would hold a summit meeting with the Chinese president Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida to conclude an agreement, assuming both sides made additional progress. Trump tweeted on Sunday night that progress had been made on \u201cstructural issues including intellectual property protection, technology transfer, agriculture, services, currency, and many other issues\u201d in the talks in Washington. He ended by saying that it had been a \u201cgreat weekend\u201d for the US and China. Trump had planned to raise tariffs to 25% from 10% on $200bn worth of Chinese imports into the United States if an agreement between the world\u2019s two largest economies were not reached by Friday. His remarks sent shares in Asia to their highest point for five months on Monday as optimism mounted about an agreement. The Shanghai market saw the most notable gains, surging 3.5% to heights not seen since last June and taking this year\u2019s gains to more than 20%. The Nikkei in Tokyo was 0.5% higher while the Kospi in Seoul rose 0.45%. The Australian dollar, a proxy for Chinese trade, also climbed on the news. \u201cThe high frequency engagement between Beijing and Washington at a senior level implies that both sides are looking for some form of settlement,\u201d said Tai Hui, chief market strategist Asia Pacific at JP Morgan Asset Management.

It will likely be cheered by markets as a sign of an end to the year-long dispute that has disrupted commerce worth hundreds of billions of dollars of goods and slowed global economic growth. During talks that extended into the weekend, US and Chinese negotiators were discussing on Sunday the issue of how to enforce a potential deal after making progress on other structural issues, according to a source familiar with the talks. The two sides were discussing tariffs on Sunday as well as commodities, the source said. Talks were extended into the weekend after negotiators produced a deal on currency during negotiations last week. Officials were seeking to iron out differences on changes to China\u2019s treatment of state-owned enterprises, subsidies, forced technology transfers and cyber theft. The two sides have been negotiating an enforcement mechanism. Washington wants a strong mechanism to ensure that Chinese reform commitments were followed through to completion, while Beijing insisted on what it called a \u201cfair and objective\u201d process.

      "bodyText": "Green Book has been named best picture in a surprise victory over Roma, during an Oscars ceremony that lacked a host but was filled with diversity and historic wins. The feelgood comedy drama, starring Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen and directed by Peter Farrelly, had been dogged by problems during awards season, and some people have questioned the veracity of its supposed true story, about the friendship between pianist Don Shirley and his chauffeur Tony Lip. Ali also took home the award for best supporting actor, dedicating his win to Shirley, whose family have come out against the film\u2019s portrayal of him. The actor, who also won for Moonlight in 2017, has become the first black man to win the best supporting actor award more than once. Green Book also won the Oscar for best original screenplay. Roma, the intimate Netflix drama that many had predicted would make Oscars history as the first foreign-language best picture winner, took home three awards, including best director for Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n. Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s younger years inspired the film, which tells the story of a domestic worker\u2019s relationship with the family who employs her. \u201cAs artists, our job is to look where others don\u2019t,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n said. \u201cThis responsibility becomes even more important at times when we are told to look away.\u201d Roma became Mexico\u2019s first winner for best foreign language film, while Cuar\u00f3n also picked up the award for best cinematography. The night was also a game-changing moment for Netflix, containing their biggest Oscar wins to date. In the night\u2019s other big shock, predicted best actress winner Glenn Close lost out to Olivia Colman for her role as Queen Anne in Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s dark comedy The Favourite. \u201cIt\u2019s genuinely quite stressful,\u201d she said, arriving on stage. \u201cThis is hilarious \u2013 I\u2019ve won an Oscar!\u201d She thanked co-stars Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone, naming them \u201cthe two loveliest women in the world to go to work with\u201d. Despite The Favourite entering the night with 10 nominations, it was the only award given to the film. Rami Malek was named best actor for playing Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, following on from a string of other wins this awards season. He is the first Arab American to have won the best actor Oscar. \u201cI may not have been the obvious choice but I guess it worked out,\u201d the Mr Robot star said during his acceptance speech. He failed to mention the film\u2019s credited director Bryan Singer, who was removed from the project and who has since been accused of numerous counts of sexual misconduct and sex with minors \u2013 though he denies all claims and has called them \u201ca homophobic smear\u201d. Bohemian Rhapsody also won awards for best editing, best sound editing and best sound mixing, and the winners in all these categories also avoided mention of Singer. Regina King picked up the best supporting actress award for her role in Barry Jenkins\u2019 emotive drama If Beale Street Could Talk, beating Bafta winner Rachel Weisz. A tearful King paid tribute to both Jenkins and James Baldwin, whose 1974 novel the film is based on, calling him \u201cone of the great artists of our time\u201d. The night began with a performance by Queen, led by Adam Lambert, before the arrival of Amy Poehler, Tina Fey and Maya Rudolph, who answered some burning questions for viewers. \u201cThere is no host tonight, there won\u2019t be a popular movie category tonight, and Mexico will not be paying for the wall,\u201d Rudolph said. The trio then offered up an all-too-brief tease of what it would have looked like if they had been hosting. Apart from Melissa McCarthy and Brian Tyree Henry, who dressed up in a combination of elements from the year\u2019s best costume design nominees to give the award, the night was free from skits, and played straighter than usual. It was a mostly apolitical night, without much mention of Donald Trump, although in presenting the award for best foreign language film, Javier Bardem started by saying, in Spanish: \u201cThere are no borders or walls that can restrain ingenuity or talent.\u201d While accepting the award for best adapted screenplay for BlacKkKlansman, Spike Lee reminded Americans that the 2020 election is around the corner. \u201cWe must all mobilise, we must all be on the right side of history,\u201d he said. Sony\u2019s critically acclaimed Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse, which brought much-needed diversity to the Spider-Man universe, was named best animated feature, putting an end to Disney\u2019s six-year hold on the category. \u201cTo our audience, we just want you to know that we see you,\u201d said co-director Peter Ramsey. Elsewhere, Disney did win best animated short for Bao. Nominated for eight Oscars, A Star Is Born had to make do with only one win, for best original song. While accepting the award for Shallow, a tearful Lady Gaga said: \u201cI\u2019ve worked hard for a long time and it\u2019s not about winning. What it\u2019s about is not giving up. If you have a dream, fight for it.\u201d The song was performed onstage by Gaga and Bradley Cooper earlier in the night, and received a standing ovation. The evening saw historic wins for Ruth Carter, the first black winner of the best costume design award, and Hannah Beachler, the first black winner of best production design, both for Black Panther. The Marvel film also won best original score for composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson, a longtime collaborator of director Ryan Coogler. The annual in memoriam section, this year scored by John Williams, remembered artists including Margot Kidder, Bernardo Bertolucci, Neil Simon, Burt Reynolds, Milos Forman, Penny Marshall, Stan Lee, William Goldman, Nicolas Roeg and Albert Finney, although character actor Dick Miller, known for work in Gremlins and The Terminator, was left out. \u201cI can\u2019t believe a film about menstruation just won an Oscar,\u201d said director Rayka Zehtabchi, who took home the Oscar for best documentary short for Period. End of Sentence \u2013 beating the Guardian\u2019s contender Black Sheep. The Oscar for best documentary was awarded to Free Solo, the story of free-climber Alex Honnold. The 91st ceremony had been plagued with indecision and problems, from Kevin Hart\u2019s history of homophobia leading to him stepping down as host, to the decision not to include an award for popular film, to the reversal of the announcement that four awards would take place in commercial breaks. The Academy had also stated that the ceremony would come in at a tidy three hours, yet it ran to almost three and a half.",

      "body": "<p>In the foyer of Redfern arts centre Carriageworks, it was difficult to tell who was a patron and who was a performer at Australia\u2019s biggest vogue ball, <a href=\"https://us4.campaign-archive.com/?u=9802695621baa9f5b33f76d6f&amp;id=5f7bc06e13\">Sissy Ball</a>. Despite the bleak, rainy weather, sartorial maximalism was on full display: there were seas of candy-coloured wigs, towering, thigh-high patent-leather boots, and fishnets from neck down. It was hard to find someone not coated with feathers or sequins or draped in fur.</p> <p>Sissy Ball, now in its second year as part of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras and a coproduction with Red Bull Music, is inspired by the New York Ballroom scene, pioneered by the trans and gay black and Latinx community in Harlem in the 1920s. The scene was the birthplace of vogueing, a dance characterised by its sharp, bold movements, heightened theatricality and emphasis on posing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/feb/22/marawa-the-amazing-how-one-woman-with-200-hula-hoops-became-a-teen-girl-guru\">Marawa the Amazing: how one woman with 200 hula hoops became a teen girl guru</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2019, ballroom and drag culture still thrives in queer communities but has also transformed popular culture. Last year, the television powerhouse Ryan Murphy launched drama series Pose, which chronicles the ball scene in the late 80s. And over the past decade, reality show RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race \u2013 which some see as an extension of the ballroom scene \u2013 has morphed from cult favourite to cultural phenomenon. Ballroom\u2019s influence on fashion, dance, music and language throughout the decades is expansive and ubiquitous, but it has often been adopted with little or no credit given to its creators.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8656cb64d0a6e50500eb9fed89e792f34a256bda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8656cb64d0a6e50500eb9fed89e792f34a256bda/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dashaun Wesley.

Saturday\u2019s event involved battles between Asia-Pacific houses Sl\u00e9, Luna, IMAN and Amazon, but most of the ball\u2019s commentators (the vogue instructor Dashaun Wesley and the rapper and renowned ballroom MC Precious Ebony), judges (Leiomy Maldonado, often referred to as the \u201cWonder Woman of vogue\u201d) and DJ MikeQ, were involved in the New York scene.</p> <p>Before the competition began, the ball\u2019s curator, multidisciplinary artist and mother to House of Sl\u00e9, Bhenji Ra, reminded the audience that the glamorous art form cannot be divorced from its political context and history. She asked the audience to reckon with the \u201csocio-political bodies\u201d up on stage, who disproportionately face violence, and too often death, due to persecution on the basis of their queer identities. \u201cGive it up for resistance, for virtuosity, for fucking tradition,\u201d she called to the crowd.</p> <p>First up was the Hands category, in which individual performers sat centre-stage, twirled and twisted their hands at lightning speed, with mechanical precision. \u201cYour hands should tell a story,\u201d explained Precious. Exceptional movements were met with shrieks and cheers from the crowd, who waved auction paddles with the number 10 written on them. The paddles were also used by judges to signal their approval.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"15539e77f9f32108373f1522e4bf02aae2d97ded\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15539e77f9f32108373f1522e4bf02aae2d97ded/1330_615_2174_2718/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras and Red Bull Music Present: Sissy Ball.

Those who made it through were paired up with a competitor from another house to duel it out until one of them was crowned the category\u2019s grand prize winner.</p> <p>Competition was often tight, but audience members rarely vocally displayed disapproval of judges\u2019 decisions. Boisterous wolf-whistles, spirited screams and applause echoed throughout the industrial space. It was, as Ra said midway through the night, an event for, and by, the local queer community of colour\u2013 linking the audience and performers to an important history of resistance, while at the same time creating a safe, community-led space for affirmation and self-expression.</p> <p>Throughout the ball, performers posed and cavorted their way across different categories. Face was a celebration of beauty, but one couldn\u2019t solely rest on their physical laurels \u2013 \u201cYou have to sell it,\u201d Wesley boomed. Runway was all about the contenders\u2019 model walk. The theme was national costume and it felt like a Miss Universe pageant but with far more ingenuity and style, with elaborate ensembles and national flags fashioned into billowing dresses. The category winner, resplendent in a neon yellow skin-tight dress, won the judges and crowd over by powerfully strutting down the runway while pushing a trolley bag and throwing a bouquet of spring onions into the crowd. Sex Siren saw contestants sauntering along in lingerie and barely-there threads of denim, while Female Figure and Vogue Femme required them to dance \u2013 and they did, dizzyingly and dramatically. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/feb/20/unadorned-gritty-unpretentious-how-australian-circus-went-global\">'Unadorned, gritty, unpretentious': how Australian circus went global</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Audience members were encouraged to enter competition rounds as \u201crogues\u201d but there were rules, and when some entrants danced around the stage during the runway category, the music was cut and they were booted. \u201cThis isn\u2019t lip sync for your life,\u201d said Wesley, the Drag Race reference lapped up by the crowd.</p> <p>As the show at Carriageworks drew to a close (even though more competition would go on late into the night, at after-hours gay bar The Colombian), Bhenji Ra reminded the audience that this was far from the extent of the ball scene in Sydney. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t just happen once a year.

      "bodyText": "In the foyer of Redfern arts centre Carriageworks, it was difficult to tell who was a patron and who was a performer at Australia\u2019s biggest vogue ball, Sissy Ball. Despite the bleak, rainy weather, sartorial maximalism was on full display: there were seas of candy-coloured wigs, towering, thigh-high patent-leather boots, and fishnets from neck down. It was hard to find someone not coated with feathers or sequins or draped in fur. Sissy Ball, now in its second year as part of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras and a coproduction with Red Bull Music, is inspired by the New York Ballroom scene, pioneered by the trans and gay black and Latinx community in Harlem in the 1920s. The scene was the birthplace of vogueing, a dance characterised by its sharp, bold movements, heightened theatricality and emphasis on posing. In 2019, ballroom and drag culture still thrives in queer communities but has also transformed popular culture. Last year, the television powerhouse Ryan Murphy launched drama series Pose, which chronicles the ball scene in the late 80s. And over the past decade, reality show RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race \u2013 which some see as an extension of the ballroom scene \u2013 has morphed from cult favourite to cultural phenomenon. Ballroom\u2019s influence on fashion, dance, music and language throughout the decades is expansive and ubiquitous, but it has often been adopted with little or no credit given to its creators. In ballroom culture, houses compete as teams at balls, but they also exist as a self-determined family unit, led by \u201cmothers\u201d and \u201cfathers\u201d that mentor and provide safe havens for their \u201cchildren\u201d. Saturday\u2019s event involved battles between Asia-Pacific houses Sl\u00e9, Luna, IMAN and Amazon, but most of the ball\u2019s commentators (the vogue instructor Dashaun Wesley and the rapper and renowned ballroom MC Precious Ebony), judges (Leiomy Maldonado, often referred to as the \u201cWonder Woman of vogue\u201d) and DJ MikeQ, were involved in the New York scene. Before the competition began, the ball\u2019s curator, multidisciplinary artist and mother to House of Sl\u00e9, Bhenji Ra, reminded the audience that the glamorous art form cannot be divorced from its political context and history. She asked the audience to reckon with the \u201csocio-political bodies\u201d up on stage, who disproportionately face violence, and too often death, due to persecution on the basis of their queer identities. \u201cGive it up for resistance, for virtuosity, for fucking tradition,\u201d she called to the crowd. First up was the Hands category, in which individual performers sat centre-stage, twirled and twisted their hands at lightning speed, with mechanical precision. \u201cYour hands should tell a story,\u201d explained Precious. Exceptional movements were met with shrieks and cheers from the crowd, who waved auction paddles with the number 10 written on them. The paddles were also used by judges to signal their approval. Those who lacked finesse or energy were promptly \u201cchopped\u201d from the round of competition, but not without hugs and words of encouragement (\u201cKeep practising honey, try harder next year\u201d). Those who made it through were paired up with a competitor from another house to duel it out until one of them was crowned the category\u2019s grand prize winner. Competition was often tight, but audience members rarely vocally displayed disapproval of judges\u2019 decisions. Boisterous wolf-whistles, spirited screams and applause echoed throughout the industrial space. It was, as Ra said midway through the night, an event for, and by, the local queer community of colour\u2013 linking the audience and performers to an important history of resistance, while at the same time creating a safe, community-led space for affirmation and self-expression. Throughout the ball, performers posed and cavorted their way across different categories. Face was a celebration of beauty, but one couldn\u2019t solely rest on their physical laurels \u2013 \u201cYou have to sell it,\u201d Wesley boomed. Runway was all about the contenders\u2019 model walk. The theme was national costume and it felt like a Miss Universe pageant but with far more ingenuity and style, with elaborate ensembles and national flags fashioned into billowing dresses. The category winner, resplendent in a neon yellow skin-tight dress, won the judges and crowd over by powerfully strutting down the runway while pushing a trolley bag and throwing a bouquet of spring onions into the crowd. Sex Siren saw contestants sauntering along in lingerie and barely-there threads of denim, while Female Figure and Vogue Femme required them to dance \u2013 and they did, dizzyingly and dramatically. Audience members were encouraged to enter competition rounds as \u201crogues\u201d but there were rules, and when some entrants danced around the stage during the runway category, the music was cut and they were booted. \u201cThis isn\u2019t lip sync for your life,\u201d said Wesley, the Drag Race reference lapped up by the crowd. As the show at Carriageworks drew to a close (even though more competition would go on late into the night, at after-hours gay bar The Colombian), Bhenji Ra reminded the audience that this was far from the extent of the ball scene in Sydney. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t just happen once a year. We are a living, breathing community of trans women of colour and queer people of colour. You better see it, alright? Come to our balls. Support the girls. We are here. And we\u2019re not going to leave any time soon.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Women in Bangladesh and Vietnam making clothes for the $23bn Australian fashion industry are going hungry because of wages as low as 51 cents an hour, an Oxfam report has found. The aid group interviewed 470 garment workers employed at factories supplying brands such as Big W, Kmart, Target and Cotton On, and found 100% of surveyed workers in Bangladesh and 74% in Vietnam could not make ends meet. \u201cThe investigation has uncovered the widespread payment of poverty wages and the impact this is having on the lives of the workers, mainly women, making the clothes Australians love to wear,\u201d Oxfam Australia chief, Helen Szoke, said. \u201cWomen who are unable to get treatment when they fall sick, workers who cannot afford to send their children to school, families that cannot make their pay stretch to put enough food on the table, people sleeping on floors in overcrowded houses, spiralling debts, mothers separated from their children \u2013 these are just some of the common realities of the failure of big brands to ensure the payment of living wages.\u201d Nine out of 10 workers interviewed in Bangladesh said they could not afford enough food for themselves and their families and were forced to skip meals or go into debt. In the same country 72% of workers interviewed could not afford medical treatment, compared with 53% in Vietnam. In Bangladesh, one in three workers interviewed was separated from their children because of inadequate income. The report details the plight of a Bangladeshi 21-year-old single mother, Tania, who works up to 12 hours a day in a factory supplying clothes to brands including Kmart and earns $169 a month, or about 55 cents an hour. She was forced to send her baby back to her village to be cared for by her parents and sees her daughter only twice a year. Another worker profiled, Chameli, earns about 51 cents an hour for her work as a helper in a factory in Bangladesh that supplies clothes to brands including Big W. Her family cannot afford to send any of her three daughters to school and the eldest, aged 14, has also started working in a garment factory. The family of five live in a crowded compound on the outskirts of Dhaka in a 3.6 metre by 2.4 metre room, where the two youngest girls sleep on the floor. Deloitte Access Economics estimates that on average just 4% of the price of a piece of clothing sold in Australia goes towards the wages of the workers who made it. Oxfam said if brands absorbed the cost of paying a living wage, it would amount to less than 1% of the garment price. The research found practices by Australian companies were contributing to driving wages down. \u201cThey undertake fierce price negotiation, often jump between contracts instead of working with factories over the long term, squeeze lead times for orders and operate with a separation between their ethical and standards staff and their buying teams, who negotiate directly with factories,\u201d the report said. \u201cOne factory owner even reported the extensive measures a company had taken to keep their clothing safe in case of a fire, but a lack of interest from the very same company in fire safety measures for the workspaces where people sew their clothes.\u201d Szoke said Oxfam was not advocating boycotts of brands, but encouraged shoppers to contact fashion retailers via social media to demand living wages for garment workers. Cotton On, Kmart, Target and City Chic have recently announced plans to achieve a living wage for the workers in their supply chains.",

The referendum asked voters if they opposed, supported or held neither opinion on the construction of a military base in Henoko, a fishing village on the island\u2019s north-east coast that is home to coral reefs and one of the few remaining habitats of the dugong. The new facility is supposed to replace the marines\u2019 Futenma airbase, located in the middle of a densely populated city.

This is the tour that shaped his album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/sep/07/urban.shopping\">Graduation</a>. We are all witness to the moment that Kanye became Kanye, when he moved from just another performer to a cultural artefact. But the crowd isn\u2019t here to see Kanye. He\u2019s just the opening act. We\u2019re here for the largest of all the larger-than-life acts currently walking the Earth. We\u2019re here to see U2.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/24/u2-stars-busk-for-the-homeless-in-first-performance-since-2015\">U2 stars busk for the homeless at festive charity gig in Dublin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When I received the request to write about my love for U2 in a public forum I did what anyone would do and presumed that I was being bullied. I\u2019m still not entirely convinced this isn\u2019t the case. To expose yourself as a devoted U2 fan is akin to saying \u201cI love to do my taxes\u201d. There\u2019s nothing <em>evil</em> about it, it\u2019s just a little sad.</p> <p>There\u2019s good reason for this, of course. My glasses aren\u2019t so rose-tinted that I can\u2019t see that I\u2019ve chosen to love one of the most obnoxious bands of all time. This is the band that put an album on your phone without asking. The band that has been represented in pop culture by a very earnest man in very silly glasses. A band whose music is the sonic equivalent of a lukewarm creamy soup.</p> <p>(It goes without saying that any true U2 fan has a rebuttal handy for all of these. They gave you a free album and it\u2019s actually pretty good. He has a medical condition. Soup is good for you. And so on.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They\u2019re too simple, too preachy, too cringeworthy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To love U2 is to be comfortable with paradox. You balance music that feels innately personal with the knowledge that it was designed to fill stadiums. You weigh songs that speak to humility against the fact that they come out of Bono\u2019s mouth. You juggle the anti-capitalist messaging of Zooropa with the use of Vertigo to launch the iPod. Though, again, many fans would argue that launching the iPod with the worst single U2 has ever recorded was in itself an act of defiance.</p> <p>There is no special gravitas that comes with being a U2 fan. Never in my life have I ever \u201cintroduced\u201d someone to U2. They don\u2019t need to have their artistic record defended by me. They\u2019re one of the highest grossing band of all time. They\u2019re doing fine.</p> <p>What I want to speak about is the joy and freedom of loving a band whose faults are so well known, whose successes seem so far behind, and whose name carries no cultural credibility for those proudly repping the fandom. They\u2019re too simple, too preachy, too cringeworthy.</p> <p>To love U2 is to fully embrace the \u201cdance like nobody\u2019s watching\u201d mentality championed by throw pillows everywhere. Not in the least because the second U2 comes on through the speakers, the dancefloor clears and your party is over.</p> <p>It\u2019s knowing that something doesn\u2019t have to be <em>good</em> to be <em>good to you</em>. That sounds like a phrase from a self-help manual but it\u2019s true to me. There\u2019s no cool way to listen to U2. You have to be OK with the fact that this isn\u2019t cool, it isn\u2019t what you should be listening to, and yet it makes you feel something. It is the modern dilemma \u2013 how can something be so large, so commercial, so watered down, yet still feel so personal.</p> <p>To stand in the crowd in a U2 show is to be surrounded by absolute dorks, to know that you are one too, and to feel the strength in those numbers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/28/pious-plonker-or-misunderstood-do-gooder-why-we-should-all-lay-off-bono\">Pious plonker or just misunderstood: why we should all lay off Bono</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is something defiant about being earnest in the current times. When it feels like ironic detachment is the only coping mechanism possible to process the modern world, it takes effort to give your heart to something imperfect, undeserving and annoyingly positive. But it\u2019s an effort worth making. It\u2019s a mentality I strive to hold \u2013 to never be so concerned with personal image that you aren\u2019t willing to really feel what needs to be felt, to cry out when it deserves it, and to love something that could easily be left by the wayside.</p> <p>My pride in U2 fandom goes beyond their music, though I will argue to my grave that every album has at least three good songs. It is about being the kind of loser who will speak in a major publication about a lame thing that makes him happy.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s late 2006 and Kanye West is on stage at Sydney\u2019s Olympic Stadium. This is the tour that shaped his album Graduation. We are all witness to the moment that Kanye became Kanye, when he moved from just another performer to a cultural artefact. But the crowd isn\u2019t here to see Kanye. He\u2019s just the opening act. We\u2019re here for the largest of all the larger-than-life acts currently walking the Earth. We\u2019re here to see U2. When I received the request to write about my love for U2 in a public forum I did what anyone would do and presumed that I was being bullied. I\u2019m still not entirely convinced this isn\u2019t the case. To expose yourself as a devoted U2 fan is akin to saying \u201cI love to do my taxes\u201d. There\u2019s nothing evil about it, it\u2019s just a little sad. There\u2019s good reason for this, of course. My glasses aren\u2019t so rose-tinted that I can\u2019t see that I\u2019ve chosen to love one of the most obnoxious bands of all time. This is the band that put an album on your phone without asking. The band that has been represented in pop culture by a very earnest man in very silly glasses. A band whose music is the sonic equivalent of a lukewarm creamy soup. (It goes without saying that any true U2 fan has a rebuttal handy for all of these. They gave you a free album and it\u2019s actually pretty good. He has a medical condition. Soup is good for you. And so on.) To love U2 is to be comfortable with paradox. You balance music that feels innately personal with the knowledge that it was designed to fill stadiums. You weigh songs that speak to humility against the fact that they come out of Bono\u2019s mouth. You juggle the anti-capitalist messaging of Zooropa with the use of Vertigo to launch the iPod. Though, again, many fans would argue that launching the iPod with the worst single U2 has ever recorded was in itself an act of defiance. There is no special gravitas that comes with being a U2 fan. Never in my life have I ever \u201cintroduced\u201d someone to U2. They don\u2019t need to have their artistic record defended by me. They\u2019re one of the highest grossing band of all time. They\u2019re doing fine. What I want to speak about is the joy and freedom of loving a band whose faults are so well known, whose successes seem so far behind, and whose name carries no cultural credibility for those proudly repping the fandom. They\u2019re too simple, too preachy, too cringeworthy. To love U2 is to fully embrace the \u201cdance like nobody\u2019s watching\u201d mentality championed by throw pillows everywhere. Not in the least because the second U2 comes on through the speakers, the dancefloor clears and your party is over. It\u2019s knowing that something doesn\u2019t have to be good to be good to you. That sounds like a phrase from a self-help manual but it\u2019s true to me. There\u2019s no cool way to listen to U2. You have to be OK with the fact that this isn\u2019t cool, it isn\u2019t what you should be listening to, and yet it makes you feel something. It is the modern dilemma \u2013 how can something be so large, so commercial, so watered down, yet still feel so personal. To stand in the crowd in a U2 show is to be surrounded by absolute dorks, to know that you are one too, and to feel the strength in those numbers. There is something defiant about being earnest in the current times. When it feels like ironic detachment is the only coping mechanism possible to process the modern world, it takes effort to give your heart to something imperfect, undeserving and annoyingly positive. But it\u2019s an effort worth making. It\u2019s a mentality I strive to hold \u2013 to never be so concerned with personal image that you aren\u2019t willing to really feel what needs to be felt, to cry out when it deserves it, and to love something that could easily be left by the wayside. My pride in U2 fandom goes beyond their music, though I will argue to my grave that every album has at least three good songs. It is about being the kind of loser who will speak in a major publication about a lame thing that makes him happy. We all deserve that feeling and if you can find it in something as uncomplicated as a four-chord structure laden with effects then all power to you. There is nothing cool about loving U2. That\u2019s why I love them. \u2022 James Colley is a comedian and writer for Gruen, Tomorrow Tonight and The Weekly",

      "bodyText": "Standing on the court steps earlier this month after spending a night in detention, Philippine journalist Maria Ressa spoke defiantly to the dozens of gathered cameras. This was, she pointed out, the sixth time she had posted bail in the space of two months. \u201cI will pay more bail than convicted criminals,\u201d said Ressa. \u201cI will pay more bail than Imelda Marcos.\u201d Ressa, the editor and founder of Rappler, a Philippine online news outlet which has been highly critical of president Rodrigo Duterte, has borne the brunt of a targeted crackdown on opposition media in the Philippines, a country which just two years ago was considered something of a beacon of free press in south-east Asia. The witch-hunt against Ressa and Rappler has seen the small but influential news organisation hit with a never-ending series of investigations and charges, from accusations of illegal foreign ownership and tax evasion to the latest charge of cyberlibel. While it is a stark illustration of the Duterte regime\u2019s increasing disregard for press freedom, it is also part of a broader regional trend, which is seeing criminal law weaponised to target journalists and muzzle the press. \u201cSouth-east Asia has never been an easy place for press freedom but what we have seen recently is a really alarming decline in almost every country, from arrests in Myanmar and the complete obliteration of opposition press in Cambodia to everything that\u2019s been happening to Rappler in the Philippines. Then also in Thailand, where the junta have spent the past five years of their rule steadily crushing media freedom,\u201d said Shawn Crispin, south-east Asia representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists. \u2018Something out of Orwell\u2019s 1984\u2019 In September 2018 Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were sentenced to seven years behind bars in Myanmar for breaking the official secrets act. The pair had been investigating the military\u2019s massacre of the Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state and were among the first to reveal the levels of brutality. Reuters allege the men were set up because of their journalism. But despite a case full of flimsy and contradictory evidence they were convicted and Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government has repeatedly resisted calls for them to be pardoned. Yin Yadanar Thein, director of Free Expression Myanmar, called the situation \u201cdire and marked by self-censorship and fear\u201d. While the election of the NLD government in 2015, led by de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, was supposed to mark a new era for freedom of expression in Myanmar, she said it could not be further from the reality. The situation was only worsening, she said, leaving the vast majority of Myanmar people with media \u201cthat sounds like something out of George Orwell\u2019s 1984\u201d. While not yet at the same censorship levels as Myanmar, the weaponisation of the law against critical journalists like Ressa is also increasingly becoming the norm in the Philippines, and cases have also been filed against the board of the Philippine Inquirer newspaper and news channel ABS-CBN. Rappler itself is facing nine legal cases and when Ressa was taken in by officers from national bureau of investigation, she was held overnight in what she described as a stunt. \u201cThe whole thing was just an intimidation tactic to make me and the Rappler team feel like they have the power to take away our freedom, and that\u2019s extremely petty,\u201d Ressa told the Guardian, accusing the government of using \u201cmob tactics\u201d. \u201cBut in the end they overplayed their hand, it just shows abuse of power by the government against the press,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd they chose the wrong journalist to pick on.\u201d \u2018The damage is done\u2019 Thailand, like the Philippines, was also once held up for its independent media, but five years of military rule following the 2014 coup has all but strangled the free press, with multiple journalists arrested and prosecuted for critical coverage of the military under the computer crimes act or charged under the draconian lese majeste act, which prevents any criticism of the monarchy. While most of the countries in the region have seen a slow burn in the decline in press freedoms, the obliteration of the free press in Cambodia was quick and severe. It followed the dissolution of all opposition political parties and led the way for prime minister Hun Sen to run in July\u2019s election uncontested and unchallenged in the press. In less than two years, Cambodia went from having a fairly vibrant media industry to the closure of the main opposition paper the Cambodia Daily, the closure of all independent national and local radio stations, the arrest of multiple journalists and the change in ownership of the Phnom Penh Post. The paper is now run by a businessman with connections to Hun Sen, which has led to noticeably pro-regime coverage shift. There have been international factors at play.

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government\u2019s emissions reduction fund \u2013 rebadged as a \u201cclimate solutions\u201d policy and to be boosted with an extra $2bn \u2013 is being used to help one of the world\u2019s biggest gold miners pay for a fossil fuel power plant the company concedes it would have built anyway. Fund opponents say it is the latest evidence that design flaws in the scheme are leading to taxpayers\u2019 money being wasted on projects that are commercially viable even without public support. In some cases, the climate funding is going to new fossil fuel projects on the grounds that they are cleaner than the dirty projects they replace. National greenhouse gas emissions have risen each year since the fund, billed by the then-prime minister Tony Abbott as a \u201cdirect action\u201d policy, replaced a carbon pricing scheme in 2014. South African mining company Gold Fields is receiving climate funding for a gas-fired station to power the underground Granny Smith mine in outback Western Australia. According to its annual reports, it has received $126,000 and expects to get about $1m over seven years. Gold Fields built the gas plant to replace a diesel-fired generator after it was announced a new gas pipeline would be laid to supply the nearby Tropicana mine. It qualified for the emissions reduction fund because burning gas emits less carbon dioxide than diesel. To qualify to bid into the emissions reduction fund, projects are meant to deliver emissions cuts that would not have happened without public money. But a Gold Fields spokesman told Guardian Australia that it would have built the gas plant regardless of support from the fund. \u201cThe investment would have been made, but at the time there was a risk that gas prices could have risen in the future, like we have seen recently on the east coast of Australia. When the investment decision was made, the [fund] was considered a partial mitigation against future price escalation,\u201d the spokesman said. Kelly O\u2019Shanassy, the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, which has been investigating the fund\u2019s operation, said it was beyond parody that public money earmarked to cut emissions had been handed to a giant gold miner to burn gas for a project it would have built anyway. She said the project may add to damage to the climate by locking the miner into gas ahead of a more rapid shift to renewable energy. Gold Fields recently announced it would be installing solar power and batteries at the mine site to use alongside gas. \u201cAustralians should rightly ask whether allocating more money to the emissions reduction fund at this time will mean more cash for big industrial players to burn coal, oil and gas,\u201d O\u2019Shanassy said. \u201cA program like the emissions reduction fund has a role to encourage farmers and landowners to cut pollution, plant more trees and protect vegetation, but methods that pay large corporations to make at best minor changes must be scrapped before any more cash is tipped in.\u201d The $2.55bn fund works as a reverse auction, supporting the projects that promise the cheapest emissions cuts. Payments are made once the cuts are delivered. Across eight auctions, taxpayers have paid out $476m and committed another $1.8bn, with $226m left unspent. On Monday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, promised another $2bn over 10 years to partner with farmers, local governments and businesses to deliver \u201cpractical climate solutions\u201d across the economy that reduce emissions. He said the government was committed to \u201cmeaningful, practical action\u201d to reduce emissions and would meet its 2030 target of a 26-28% cut in pollution below 2005 levels. Most projections before Monday\u2019s announcement, which also included a commitment to new investments in pumped hydro power and a yet-to-be-released electric vehicle strategy, have found it was not on track to meet the target. \u201cWe will continue to play our part in meeting the global challenge of climate change in the 21st century,\u201d Morrison said. Guardian Australia recently reported that the Vales Point coalmine has been registered under the fund for a project to upgrade some turbines, a project that would reduce its emissions by just 1.3% over a decade. It may yet not qualify to bid into the auction as the project will not reduce its emissions intensity below the average of the national grid. But the revelation that a coal plant could qualify for climate funding sparked campaigns from environment groups calling for the scheme to be changed. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated that putting the world on a pathway to limiting global warming to 1.5C and avoiding more significant climate change requires coal use for energy to be cut 59-78% below 2010 levels by 2030. Several problems with the emissions reduction fund have been identified. The bulk of the money has gone to landowners promising to restore or protect carbon stores in vegetation and the land, but across the country deforestation is outpacing habitat restoration by a rate of five to one. It was found landfill sites that capture and burn leaking methane \u2013 another regular recipient of contracts under the fund \u2013 would have existed without taxpayer support. Many of these problems were predicted. While on the backbench in 2010, Malcolm Turnbull branded the fund \u201ca recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale\u201d and let the fund dwindle. Once prime minister, he let the fund dwindle to almost nothing and promoted alternatives such as the national energy guarantee, which was opposed by conservatives and dumped by Morrison once he assumed the leadership. In the case of Gold Fields, the company has announced that it is expanding both the Granny Smith mine and the gas plant as well as installing solar and batteries. It said the shift would cut its gas use by 10\u201313%, but the gas plant needed to be expanded to meet increased demand for ventilation, cooling and dewatering at night. The company\u2019s spokesman said it would receive large-scale generation certificates through the national renewable energy target for the solar energy it generates, but the projected future value of the certificates was not encouraging for future clean power investment in Australia. Asked if the company thought helping large businesses shift to a cleaner form of fossil fuels was a good use of climate funding, the spokesman said the few off-grid renewable energy mining projects in Australia to date have had some form of government support. \u201cWithout government enabling these early adopters, the movement to cleaner energy will take much longer,\u201d he said. But he said Gold Fields was demonstrating it was feasible to invest in large-scale solar without additional support.",

      "bodyText": "Taking part in the Premier League title race can be worth hundreds of millions of pounds to a football club\u2019s home city, according to a report that said Manchester City and Liverpool are squaring up for a \u00a3300m battle. The report by the thinktank Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) said competing for a league title could increase a city\u2019s economic growth by 1.1 percentage points. It said this would be worth \u00a3220m to Manchester, with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City hopeful of winning the league, while Liverpool is in line for a \u00a3133m boost from the team\u2019s effort to end a 29-year wait for the title. The effect mirrors that enjoyed by countries that reach the later stages of the World Cup, such as the economic uplift seen in England last summer, the CEBR said. The difference between the increase predicted for the two cities is because Manchester\u2019s economy is larger, and the Etihad stadium has a slightly larger capacity than Anfield. The CEBR attributed the economic gains to increased spending on match-day tickets, merchandise and local hospitality when people are feeling positive about their club and matches are well attended. Even when fans don\u2019t go to the games, they are likely to spend money locally watching televised fixtures in pubs and bars, while the feelgood factor among fans enjoying success leads to a general increase in consumer spending among supporters. The CEBR said psychological research indicates that fans associate the performance of their chosen team with their own successes and failures, which can have an impact on people\u2019s dopamine levels and overall confidence, resulting in higher spending on outings and goods. To back up its analysis, the CEBR looked at the Premier League\u2019s final standings since 1999 to see if the cities that hosted the top three teams enjoyed higher economic growth in years they performed well compared with seasons when they didn\u2019t. Their analysis showed that a city\u2019s gross value-added growth \u2013 a measure that looks at the value of goods and services produced \u2013 was on average 1.1 percentage points higher when it had a football team that finished in the top three. The CEBR pointed to research by the Leicester Castle Business School after Leicester City\u2019s surprise Premier League win in 2016 that found that extra attendance at the King Power stadium led to an expenditure increase in the city of \u00a3224,000. There was an additional \u00a322.6m of spending in the hospitality sector, with takings up by as much as 300% over five key matches. Countries with a successful football team also experience higher economic growth, the CEBR said. Between 1990 and 2014, the four countries that reached the semi-finals of the World Cup had growth in consumer spending of 4.5% in the following year, compared with an average of 3.3% growth in the year before the tournament, according to a study by Lloyds Bank.",

The opening image is of Ethan Kai\u2019s Alan nuzzling a horse in the shape of Ira Mandela Siobhan, who sports grey shorts and reveals a muscular torso. The eroticism of the relationship pays off later when Alan orgasmically bestrides the horse in question, Nugget, and when that memory intrudes on his attempt to have sex with a stable-girl.

The long-awaited package of proposed changes to relationship and sex education (RSE) are the first since 2000, after the government recognised that the current guidance was outdated. \u201cAlmost twenty years on from the last time guidance on sex education was updated, there is a lot to catch up on,\u201d said the education secretary, Damian Hinds. \u201cAlthough sex education is only mandatory to teach at secondary, it must be grounded in a firm understanding and valuing of positive relationships, and respect for others, from primary age.\u201d \u201cIn turn positive relationships are connected with good mental health, which itself is linked with physical wellbeing. So it is appropriate to make health education universal alongside relationships and sex education.\u201d According to the guidelines, secondary school pupils will be taught about female genital mutilation (FGM) with a focus on awareness over its illegality and the availability of support networks. Students aged 11 and older should also be taught about other forms of \u201chonour-based\u201d abuse, as well as grooming, forced marriage and domestic abuse, the DfE said. But the government\u2019s announcement comes amid a backlash from parent groups who do not want sex education to be a mandatory part of the curriculum. MPs are to debate a petition on Monday demanding parents retain the right to opt their child out of sex education classes in schools after more than 100,000 people stressed parents\u2019 \u201cfundamental right\u201d to decide when their children are taught RSE topics. Attendance is set to become compulsory at secondary schools from September 2020. \u201cWe have grave concerns about the physical, psychological and spiritual implications of teaching children about certain sexual and relational concepts proposed in RSE and believe that they have no place within a mandatory school curriculum,\u201d Dr Katherine Sarah Godfrey-Faussett, the petitioner, stated. A protest organised by the lobby group Stop RSE to \u201cprotect childhood innocence\u201d will take place outside parliament on Monday during the debate. They plan to urge MPs to offer parents the ability to withdraw their children from sex education classes. Former education secretary Justine Greening first proposed the reforms for secondary schools in 2017, but she had said parents would retain the right to withdraw their children from sex education. The row over whether children should be taught about LGBT rights has been brought into focus in Birmingham where a primary teacher has been the target of protests from concerned parents at Parkfield Community school, which serves a predominantly Muslim community. It prompted an intervention from the head of Ofsted, Amanda Spielman, who backed the teaching of same-sex relationships in primary schools, as well as secondaries. Campaign groups welcomed sex education being made compulsory, but there has been concern that the reforms may not go far enough and could be diluted to appease conservative interest groups. Rachel Krys, the co-director of the End Violence Against Women coalition, urged the government to make clear that the new guidance would include mandatory teaching on sex and sexuality, stereotypes about men and women, the law on consent and LGBT equality. \u201cReports of sexual violence and harassment in schools are increasing, but the DfE\u2019s previous plans included worrying references to \u2018virtues\u2019, and suggested children be taught about resisting or managing peer pressure,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a message which can easily be interpreted as teaching girls that it is their sole responsibility to keep themselves safe, ignoring the realities of harassment and abuse.\u201d She added: \u201cTeaching young people about the different forms of abuse of women and girls, and how they are connected to women\u2019s inequality and stereotypical roles, is essential if children are really to learn how to have safe, healthy and respectful relationships.\u201d On Saturday, teachers attending a National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT) conference in Birmingham were concerned that many schools were failing to tackle prejudice and promote LGBTI equality. About two-thirds of its members at the conference said that their school was not teaching children about same-sex relationships, with more than half saying there had been backlash when their school tried to teach pupils about LGBTI relationships. Chris Keates, the general secretary of the NASUWT, said schools needed greater support, calling for action where schools did not promote inclusiveness. \u201cSchools should be safe environments where staff and students of all sexual and gender identities feel included and respected,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere LGBTI equality is not mainstreamed into the work of a school this is unlikely be to the case.\u201d",
