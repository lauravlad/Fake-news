This was despite the relevant staff member being a qualified psychologist.</p> <p>Training and awareness is great, but there also needs to be the will to accept and to understand.

      "bodyText": "While I agree with the idea that it is helpful to be able to talk to managers and colleagues if you have mental health issues (It can be a wonderful freeing moment, G2, 8 April) it very much depends on the attitudes of those you work with as to the outcome. I tried to lessen the stigma around these issues by sharing some of my difficulties with colleagues in an appropriate way, but when I was open with the CEO of the small company where I had worked for over 10 years, I came to regret it. My difficulties were seen as personal weaknesses, I was not paid for time taken for mental health treatments (despite appointments for medical treatments for other staff being taken as paid time off), and I was not supported in any way. This was despite the relevant staff member being a qualified psychologist. Training and awareness is great, but there also needs to be the will to accept and to understand. It can be very difficult to judge a person\u2019s attitude towards mental health issues in advance of broaching the subject with them. I hope we can find a way to overcome this. Name and address supplied \u2022 We know that local authorities are prioritising early intervention for young people\u2019s mental health, and it\u2019s positive that they are. But as Sally Weale notes (Report, theguardian.com, 10 April), the funds available simply do not go far enough. Until the government can guarantee there will not be a postcode lottery for young people with mental health issues, we will continue to see young people fall down the cracks. Educators are in a position to provide early intervention support for students\u2019 mental health, but if they are not given adequate funding and time to do this, we will still be fighting a losing battle.

      "bodyText": "People\u2019s Vote campaigners are hoping to overhaul the establishment image of the remain campaign and its \u201cproject fear\u201d narrative with a mass listening project aimed at informing a future referendum campaign. The campaign for a fresh Brexit referendum has been holding People\u2019s Voice events for leave and remain voters and plans to expand these in an attempt to identify common concerns. The events were launched in January by the Labour MP Jess Phillips and have been held in leave-voting towns, including Grimsby and Sunderland, as well as remain towns and cities such as Glasgow and Brighton. The project is understood to be seeking to run a different campaign to the widely criticised remain operation before the 2016 referendum. Sources suggested campaigners wanted to \u201clearn the lessons\u201d of that campaign. They also hoped to convince sceptical Labour MPs that a second referendum would not necessarily be divisive, and could even allow the party to take charge of a changed narrative linked to big issues such as climate change and austerity. In a report looking at the impact of events so far, a key concern cited by both leave and remain voters was fear about falsehoods being fed to voters by politicians, including the remain campaign\u2019s \u201cproject fear\u201d and the far-fetched promises made by the leave campaign. Other worries voiced on both sides of the Brexit divide included a decline of patriotism, rising inequality, climate change and insecure work. Bridget Phillipson, the Labour MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, said a new referendum campaign would need \u201ca more respectful, honest conversation about this whole issue\u201d. She said an event she had hosted in Sunderland had proved the Brexit debate need not be acrimonious. \u201cWe can agree on the facts and the challenges our country faces even if we disagree on the solutions,\u201d she said. \u201cI know there are divisions in this country and passionately held views on all sides of the Brexit debate, but I believe we\u2019ll do far better talking about them than sweeping them under the carpet. A final-say referendum can be different from 2016: it can start a conversation that\u2019s long overdue about the things that really matter to this country.\u201d Andrew Cooper, the pollster for the 2016 Stronger In campaign who is now at Populus, conceded the 2016 referendum campaign had \u201cleft a bad taste in the mouth\u201d and had damaged trust in politics. \u201cThose campaigning to stay in the EU cannot be tin-eared to the towering challenges faced by so many people and communities across the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are very good reasons why people voted for Brexit. A successful remain campaign will have to convince them that these challenges are best fixed working within, not outside, the EU.\u201d More events are set to take place around the country, focusing on areas that voted heavily to leave, including Leigh in Greater Manchester, Luton, and Islwyn in the Welsh valleys. Huw Merriman, a former Conservative frontbencher who has become a cautious backer of a second referendum as a way to break the impasse in parliament, said the public would only accept a new referendum if it also had the backing of leave voters. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that the campaigners for a new vote show this is not just a ruse to ensure Britain stays in the EU but a genuine opportunity to disentangle Brexit from the Westminster thicket,\u201d Merriman said. \u201cThere are more MPs like me on my side of the house but the People\u2019s Vote campaign needs to change if it is to find us.\u201d Polling done for the People\u2019s Voice report found more than two-thirds of the public thought both sides in the 2016 referendum campaign had told \u201clies and scare stories, meaning that it was impossible for people to make a proper choice\u201d. More than 80% said Brexit had \u201cturned out to be much more complicated than we were told in the referendum\u201d. The report concluded that a new pro-EU campaign must address the underlying causes of the 2016 leave vote and offer credible solutions, as well as avoiding overinflated rhetoric. Most importantly, it must reject a \u201cproject fear\u201d narrative and make a positive case, the report found, a tactic that was \u201ccastigated by everyone we spoke to, it remains a complete turnoff to voters\u201d. It found that voters \u201csimply do not believe that leaving the European Union will cause immediate and significant harm to them and their families\u201d and that any new campaign should be centred on the positive difference the EU can make to jobs and rights.",

      "bodyText": "Hatfield is one of those towns with an abundance of roundabouts and no shortage of signs directing you to its centre. The problem is there is no town centre, at least nothing that looks like it\u2019s the centre of anything, so you can drive round a lot of gyratory systems before you realise that you\u2019re going in circles. It\u2019s not a bad metaphor for the political state of the nation as it gears itself up for election season. Next month, on 2 May, with the political process seemingly running over and over the same old Brexit ground, local elections will take place in 270 English councils, along with 11 more in Northern Ireland, and six directly elected mayoralities. And three weeks later there will be the European elections. The voters of Hatfield are among the lucky people who get to exercise their democratic rights twice in May. Though it has to be said that luck is not the sentiment that is most often expressed to me in the forlorn 1960s shopping precinct that turns out to be the town centre. \u201cHuh?\u201d is a typical response. As is \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d and \u201cNah, mate.\u201d My personal favourite came from a woman in her 60s, pushing a trolley outside Asda. \u201cDon\u2019t be so rude,\u201d she snapped. Is that what people mean when they speak of the coarsening of public debate? Emma is among that defiant minority prepared to share their thoughts with the fourth estate on the issue of the double vote. \u201cI\u201dm supposed to go online to register but I\u2019ve been too busy at work,\u201d she explains. She works in a cafe. \u201cBut I will vote,\u201d she reassures me, with the deadline for registration only hours away. \u201cMy boyfriend will help me. I get confused.\u201d Don\u2019t we all. These are confusing times. What does she think about the current deadlock and, while we\u2019re at it, what\u2019s her position on a second referendum? \u201cI listen to the news and I\u2019m fed up with it all, to be honest,\u201d she says quite jauntily. I notice that she\u2019s holding a newly purchased cocktail glass in her hand. It turns out it\u2019s her birthday, and she\u2019s going to have a celebration. I\u2019m far from confident that she\u2019s going to meet that registration deadline. \u201cI\u2019m not going to vote,\u201d Fran McMillan, a district nurse, tells me, though it will be the first time she\u2019s abstained in her adult life. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put Corbyn in and I can\u2019t vote Conservative or Liberal.\u201d She lays into Grant Shapps, the former co-chairman of the Conservative party and the local member of parliament. Shapps, of course, isn\u2019t up for election, but the truth is people tend to see local and European elections through the prism of parliamentary politics. Would she vote if there were a second referendum? \u201cDon\u2019t know. Probably.\u201d Does she think there should be one. \u201cYes! Definitely.\u201d Now I\u2019m confused, so I ask her what she voted in the previous referendum. \u201cI\u2019m going to get my doggy,\u201d she replies enigmatically, and marches off smiling.
