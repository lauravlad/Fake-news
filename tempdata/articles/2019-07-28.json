The most likely outcomes are: losing his majority; failing to get an agreement with the EU; and parliament blocking no deal. Thus he ends up looking weak. So, his strategy is to say he will rule out calling a snap election, while making impossible demands on Europe, so that he can claim to be forced into an election, to protect this plucky little nation facing an overbearing enemy (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/brexit-deadlock-as-no-10-insists-eu-must-scrap-backstop-before-talks\" title=\"\">Johnson sets UK on collision course with EU over backstop</a>, 27 July). A khaki election without a war. We\u2019ve rumbled you, Mr Johnson.<br><strong>Dr Nigel Mellor</strong><br><em>Newcastle upon Tyne</em></p> <p>\u2022 In July 2018, Donald Trump heaped praise on Theresa May, calling her an \u201cincredible woman\u201d. This tribute followed a shocking interview with the Sun, in which he slammed her Brexit strategy, arguing that it threatened a UK-US trade deal \u2013 the perfect example of this president\u2019s erratic nature guided by self-interest and narcissism. As Johnson and Trump embark on their honeymoon, let us recognise this love-in for what it is: temporary.</p> <p>Trump has repeatedly called for a trade deal with \u201cunlimited potential\u201d, where everything is on the table, from chlorinated chicken to the NHS. And if there\u2019s one thing we know to be true of Johnson, it\u2019s that he will say or do anything to quench his thirst for power.</p> <p>Let us not forget that being \u201cpro-Europe, pro-immigration, pro-cycling, anti-Trump\u201d secured him the keys to City Hall. Just a few years later, completely reversing this position propelled him into No 10 with the backing of less than 0.1% of the electorate.<br><strong>Catherine West MP</strong><br><em>Labour, Hornsey and Wood Green</em></p> <p>\u2022 Now that Johnson has spoken the reality is clear: there were always two Brexits. There is the Brexit for business and the moneyed middle class, gilded by the imperialist fantasies of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Johnson. This is the Brexit where tiresome regulations that protect workers and the environment are ditched and replaced by rock-bottom corporation tax. This is the Brexit of high immigration and guarantees to EU citizens that will ensure a supply of labour to service the ruling classes: willing kitchen-fitters and cleaners, knowledgeable waiters and, more expensively, multilingual staff for the world of finance. This is the Brexit where controls on food sourcing and hygiene are abandoned.</p> <p>This Brexit is a world away from the one envisaged by leave voters in Labour heartlands who felt ignored, oppressed and marginalised. Having seen wages at the bottom end squeezed and increased pressure on the NHS and housing, they thought Brexit would mean less immigration and a better life. Johnson says that not implementing Brexit would be a betrayal of democracy. It will be a far greater betrayal when his massive deception is foisted on the nation.<br><strong>Teresa Adams</strong><br><em>Bromley, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 The great thing about Boris Johnson becoming PM is that he promised that the NHS would receive an extra \u00a3350m every week when we have left the EU. At least, that was how he persuaded lots of people to vote leave during the referendum campaign. Now he is PM he will be in a position to make good on that pledge. Of course he will.<br><strong>Peter Bolwell</strong><br><em>Hastings, East Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 And so begins another Tory cycle: splash out on deprived towns, increase national debt, tighten austerity.<br><strong>Ulf Dantanus</strong><br><em>Brighton </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

The most likely outcomes are: losing his majority; failing to get an agreement with the EU; and parliament blocking no deal. Thus he ends up looking weak. So, his strategy is to say he will rule out calling a snap election, while making impossible demands on Europe, so that he can claim to be forced into an election, to protect this plucky little nation facing an overbearing enemy (Johnson sets UK on collision course with EU over backstop, 27 July). A khaki election without a war. We\u2019ve rumbled you, Mr Johnson. Dr Nigel Mellor Newcastle upon Tyne \u2022 In July 2018, Donald Trump heaped praise on Theresa May, calling her an \u201cincredible woman\u201d. This tribute followed a shocking interview with the Sun, in which he slammed her Brexit strategy, arguing that it threatened a UK-US trade deal \u2013 the perfect example of this president\u2019s erratic nature guided by self-interest and narcissism. As Johnson and Trump embark on their honeymoon, let us recognise this love-in for what it is: temporary. Trump has repeatedly called for a trade deal with \u201cunlimited potential\u201d, where everything is on the table, from chlorinated chicken to the NHS. And if there\u2019s one thing we know to be true of Johnson, it\u2019s that he will say or do anything to quench his thirst for power. Let us not forget that being \u201cpro-Europe, pro-immigration, pro-cycling, anti-Trump\u201d secured him the keys to City Hall. Just a few years later, completely reversing this position propelled him into No 10 with the backing of less than 0.1% of the electorate. Catherine West MP Labour, Hornsey and Wood Green \u2022 Now that Johnson has spoken the reality is clear: there were always two Brexits. There is the Brexit for business and the moneyed middle class, gilded by the imperialist fantasies of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Johnson. This is the Brexit where tiresome regulations that protect workers and the environment are ditched and replaced by rock-bottom corporation tax. This is the Brexit of high immigration and guarantees to EU citizens that will ensure a supply of labour to service the ruling classes: willing kitchen-fitters and cleaners, knowledgeable waiters and, more expensively, multilingual staff for the world of finance. This is the Brexit where controls on food sourcing and hygiene are abandoned. This Brexit is a world away from the one envisaged by leave voters in Labour heartlands who felt ignored, oppressed and marginalised. Having seen wages at the bottom end squeezed and increased pressure on the NHS and housing, they thought Brexit would mean less immigration and a better life. Johnson says that not implementing Brexit would be a betrayal of democracy. It will be a far greater betrayal when his massive deception is foisted on the nation. Teresa Adams Bromley, Kent \u2022 The great thing about Boris Johnson becoming PM is that he promised that the NHS would receive an extra \u00a3350m every week when we have left the EU. At least, that was how he persuaded lots of people to vote leave during the referendum campaign. Now he is PM he will be in a position to make good on that pledge. Of course he will. Peter Bolwell Hastings, East Sussex \u2022 And so begins another Tory cycle: splash out on deprived towns, increase national debt, tighten austerity.

The question is, which mob should he be worrying about? Johnson\u2019s avowedly pro-Brexit team may have given his new administration a clear direction, but he also leads a Tory party riven by factions like never before - and more than one group could end up leading the charge against his administration. Brexit purists, sacked ministers and unrepentant Remainers all pose potential threats to Johnson\u2019s room for manoeuvre. So who should he fear most?</p> <h2>Cabinet Brexiters</h2> <p>The surprise was the number of Brexiters Johnson brought in to key positions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/29/dominic-raab-more-rightwing-on-education-than-thatcher-tory-private-sector-state-schools-profit\" title=\"\">Dominic Raab</a>, the former leadership contender who was seen as the one figure who might be able to appeal to pro-Brexit MPs over Johnson, is effectively deputy PM. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former chair of the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), is in the cabinet. Andrea Leadsom is back in as business secretary. It means Johnson has reduced the number of hardline Brexiters who are free from the constraints of collective responsibility - yet the potential to resign from office also gives them a nuclear option used against Theresa May.</p> <p><strong>Rebellion risk</strong> it\u2019s hard to envisage a scenario where Johnson does anything to provoke the ire of his fellow cabinet Brexiters \u2013 or steers towards a softer Brexit \u2013 this side of an election. And, like Johnson, even Rees-Mogg voted for May\u2019s Brexit deal at the third time of asking. There seems little risk that they will be giving up the ministerial cars any time soon.</p> <p><strong>Danger rating</strong> 2/5.

      "bodyText": "After a week of cabinet defenestrations and the takeover of government by Vote Leave campaigners, the French Revolution has been a regular reference point for Tory MPs. \u201cWhat we have to remember is that in the end, the mob also came for Robespierre,\u201d one minister observed, painting Boris Johnson as the ruthless revolutionary leader who was eventually consumed by the forces he had helped unleash. The question is, which mob should he be worrying about? Johnson\u2019s avowedly pro-Brexit team may have given his new administration a clear direction, but he also leads a Tory party riven by factions like never before - and more than one group could end up leading the charge against his administration. Brexit purists, sacked ministers and unrepentant Remainers all pose potential threats to Johnson\u2019s room for manoeuvre. So who should he fear most? Cabinet Brexiters The surprise was the number of Brexiters Johnson brought in to key positions. Dominic Raab, the former leadership contender who was seen as the one figure who might be able to appeal to pro-Brexit MPs over Johnson, is effectively deputy PM. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former chair of the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), is in the cabinet. Andrea Leadsom is back in as business secretary. It means Johnson has reduced the number of hardline Brexiters who are free from the constraints of collective responsibility - yet the potential to resign from office also gives them a nuclear option used against Theresa May. Rebellion risk it\u2019s hard to envisage a scenario where Johnson does anything to provoke the ire of his fellow cabinet Brexiters \u2013 or steers towards a softer Brexit \u2013 this side of an election. And, like Johnson, even Rees-Mogg voted for May\u2019s Brexit deal at the third time of asking. There seems little risk that they will be giving up the ministerial cars any time soon. Danger rating 2/5. Happy in office. Backbench Brexiters Amid the carnage of last week\u2019s cabinet cull, one of the most significant moments came when Steve Baker, the strategy chief behind the ERG\u2019s guerrilla war against May\u2019s Brexit plans, turned down a ministerial job.
