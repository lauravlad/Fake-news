Hunt said there would be hefty costs but promised to hand out cash to deal with them. </li> <li><strong>Johnson refused to apologise for homophobic comments he has made in the past.</strong> Both men talked up their records on LGBT rights and Johnson claimed to have been one of the earliest and most vociferous supporters. But he refused to apologise for language he used in newspaper columns in the past that display the opposite.</li> <li><strong>Both men accused Jeremy Corbyn of being antisemitic.</strong> Hunt said: \u201cUnfortunately, he may be,\u201d while Johnson said he had allowed antisemitism to flourish, which amounted to the same thing.</li> <li><strong>Each candidate refused to fully commit to ending the benefits freeze.</strong> But Hunt said he would end the five-week Universal Credit wait and would be sympathetic towards a plan to end a freeze on working age benefits freeze.

Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, has been arguing for almost a year that a citizens\u2019 assembly could provide a solution to Brexit. Rory Stewart put the same idea at the heart of his Brexit plan during his short-lived bid for the Conservative party leadership. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/20/the-guardian-view-on-a-brexit-citizens-assembly-the-peoples-voice-is-needed\">the Guardian is also formally backing the idea.</a></p> <p>Unfortunately a Guardian endorsement does not always mean an idea is actually going to happen, and both possible future Tory leaders, as well as Jeremy Corbyn, have expressed no interest at all in using citizens\u2019 assemblies.</p> <p>But, not for the first time, progressive initiatives are being introduced first in Scotland and Wales. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has already announced that <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/news/citizens-assembly-of-scotland/\">she is setting up a citizens\u2019 assembly to consider what kind of country Scotland should be in the future, and how it should handle Brexit.</a> And today the Welsh assembly has announced that Wales\u2019 first citizens\u2019 assembly will meet for the first time in Newton, for three days starting from 19 July. Some 60 citizens were selected to take part, from a pool of 10,000 families randomly invited to apply, and they will consider ways to improve the democratic process in Wales.

They get unconditional access to whatever treatment they need.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think we have time to wait for the results of these pilots. So I will commit an extra \u00a330m to roll it out immediately in London and at least two other UK cities. That could help at least an extra 1000 people off the streets.

Even before she became prime minister she was notorious amongst journalists for her reluctance to any anything indiscreet - Nick Robinson once turned down a lunch with her when she was home secretary and he was BBC political editor because he thought it would be a waste of time - and as PM she has got through countless interviews giving almost nothing away.</p> <p>But another rather less well-known characteristic of hers is that she is, in the words of Tory journalist <strong>Matthew Parris</strong>, \u201ca good hater\u201d. As Parris explained last year <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/she-won-confidence-vote-but-exasperating-theresa-may-is-running-on-empty-wfxq33c7b\">in a very good Times article (paywall)</a> about his various encounters with her:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I learnt that this well-mannered woman was a good hater. At the mention of a particular colleague\u2019s name her lip curled, she made no attempt to conceal her dislike, and rather seemed to enjoy the disdain.</p> </blockquote> <p>In her final days in office this side of May\u2019s character seems to be coming out - at least, a little. The Number 10 lobby briefing this morning (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jul/15/tory-leadership-latest-news-boris-johnson-liam-fox-dismisses-boris-johnsons-plans-for-us-uk-trade-deal-as-unrealistic-live-news?page=with:block-5d2c574d8f08d0b6ca530e0d#block-5d2c574d8f08d0b6ca530e0d\"> 11.48am)</a> seems to give a clue as to what she really feels about the US president who showed his gratitude for a state visit by insulting her in public. I can think of three other examples in recent weeks where she gave a glimpse of who else is on her hate list.</p> <p><strong>1 - Jeremy Corbyn. </strong>May has often denounced Corbyn at PMQs, but <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-07-03/debates/5A86E5BB-2661-4F48-B38C-F33FDCF84499/Engagements\">two weeks ago</a> there seemed to be an added bitterness in her voice as she effectively accused him of hypocrisy, saying Labour had no right to criticise no-deal when it repeatedly voted down her own proposed Brexit deal.</p> <p><strong>2 - Nicola Sturgeon.</strong> Barack Obama once said that the only people determined to obstruct anything he did, regardless of their own interests, were Vladimir Putin and congressional Republicans. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/04/tory-leadership-latest-newst-boris-johnson-jeremy-hunt-backtracks-and-insists-foxhunting-ban-will-not-be-repealed-live-news?page=with:block-5d1e328a8f08c8227e96a6e7#block-5d1e328a8f08c8227e96a6e7\">In a recent speech in Edinburgh, </a>May said something broadly similar about Sturgeon and the Scottish government. </p> <p><strong>3 - Boris Johnson.</strong> May has been reluctant to criticise her likely successor directly, but just occasionally we get a clue as to what she may be thinking privately. There was a good example on Friday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/12/andrew-neil-boris-johnson-tory-leadership-boris-johnson-uses-andrew-neil-interview-to-deny-failing-to-support-ambassador-live-news?page=with:block-5d28c8ac8f08d0b6ca52f974#block-5d28c8ac8f08d0b6ca52f974\">when she spoke out about people who think being PM is all about power, not service. </a>It was not hard to decipher who she meant</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d2c5d848f08cf92bb77028b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-15T11:06:16.737Z\">12.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ruth Davidson</strong>, the Scottish Conservative leader, says Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt should both also condemn President Trump\u2019s racist tweets.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it form us for the evening. You can see my summary of the Tory leadership debate here and a summary of the day\u2019s earlier events here. And, if you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Rowena Mason and Jessica Elgot have the full story: The defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt, who is backing Jeremy Hunt, said after the debate: Tonight, Jeremy again showed that he is the candidate the country can rely on to deliver Brexit and also the leader we need to win a majority at the next general election and take our country forward. Throughout the campaign, and all he has been dealing with as our foreign secretary, he has shown that he is a strong leader with solid judgment based on deeply-held values. He is a leader with a clear vision, deep values and sound judgment. I see it and the public see it. I hope the membership do too because our country needs to come together, get Brexit done and show the world what our country can do. That\u2019s all from this evening\u2019s debate, here\u2019s a summary of the main points: Both candidates to be prime minister refused to explicitly denounce Donald Trump\u2019s comments about ethnic minority congresswomen as racist. While both backed Theresa May\u2019s criticism of the US president, who used racist language to attack political opponents at the weekend, neither was actually willing to describe the remarks in such terms. Boris Johnson refused to commit to lowering the net migration figure after Brexit. His opponent, Jeremy Hunt, said it was what people voted for when they voted to leave the European Union and to ignore that would constitute a \u201cbetrayal\u201d. Johnson refused to say whether or not he had costed the no-deal Brexit he says the UK should seriously consider. He claimed the costs could be minimised with thorough preparation but said the Treasury would come up with \u201cspine-chilling figures\u201d. Hunt said there would be hefty costs but promised to hand out cash to deal with them. Johnson refused to apologise for homophobic comments he has made in the past. Both men talked up their records on LGBT rights and Johnson claimed to have been one of the earliest and most vociferous supporters. But he refused to apologise for language he used in newspaper columns in the past that display the opposite. Both men accused Jeremy Corbyn of being antisemitic. Hunt said: \u201cUnfortunately, he may be,\u201d while Johnson said he had allowed antisemitism to flourish, which amounted to the same thing. Each candidate refused to fully commit to ending the benefits freeze. But Hunt said he would end the five-week Universal Credit wait and would be sympathetic towards a plan to end a freeze on working age benefits freeze. Johnson refused to commit to any plan. Will each continue to freeze fuel duty? Each refuses to say, adding they want to make no more spending commitments. When was the last time each cried? Hunt refuses to answer. Johnson says it was when his bicycle was stolen from outside Parliament. Will Ben Stokes get a knighthood? Each says yes. Would Johnson keep Hunt as foreign secretary? He refuses to say, though he says he holds him in high regard. Johnson says he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019d be right to hand out jobs at this point. Would Hunt return Johnson to the foreign office? He says he would give him a big job. Will they go out for a pint after the contest? Both agree they would. Who do they want to win Love Island? Hunt says he doesn\u2019t watch it. Johnson says he has been watching vaguely, before asking the audience for help. He jokes that Amber should win, deliberately mistaking her for the work and pensions secretary. They are asked: Is Jeremy Corbyn personally antisemitic? \u201cUnfortunately, he may be,\u201d says Hunt, nodding. \u201cI think, by condoning antisemitism in the way he does, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s effectively culpable of that vice, yes,\u201d says Johnson. The questions from the audience are finished, the candidates are moving to a \u201cquick-fire round\u201d. Each says he would stick to the pledge to achieve zero net carbon emissions by 2050. Asked about the difficulty young people have in getting on the property ladder, Hunt restates his \u201cright to own\u201d policy \u2013 under which he proposes to hand over land that has planning permission and invite young people to pay for a house to be built upon it. Johnson says the UK must build much more \u201cgood quality part buy, part rent\u201d homes to help young people who cannot afford a whole property immediately. These would be built on brownfield sites, he says. Hunt says the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, has persuaded him to end the five-week wait before people can claim Universal Credit, saying it was the right reform but had unexpected consequences. And he says he would look very sympathetically at Rudd\u2019s proposal to end the freeze on working age benefits. Johnson refuses to back the plan, saying he\u2019s \u201cprobably made enough spending commitments in the last week for the time-being\u201d. The pair share a laugh about Rudd\u2019s support as Hunt jokingly offers Johnson the DWP job. Johnson and Hunt are asked what changes they would make to the tax system to help the lowest paid. Johnson says he would raise the threshold for National Insurance and talks up the living wage. He repeats his somewhat opaque claim about his success in cutting poverty in London while serving as its mayor. Hunt says the country cannot afford the reforms he wants to make but, once he feels it can, he commits to allowing people to earn their first \u00a31,000 per month \u201cwithout paying any tax or any National Insurance\u201d. The candidates are asked how much right the public have to know about a potential prime minister\u2019s private life. Hunt says he\u2019s happy to have had his wife with him on the campaign trail. Johnson says he made it a rule years ago not to bring his family into his public life. His private life, of course, was the basis for serious questions about his character earlier in the campaign. Both candidates commit to making a woman either chancellor, foreign secretary or defence secretary. Johnson did so after some hesitation, saying: \u201cYes, I think so. Well, I dunno. I\u2019ve chucked it out there a \u2013 make of it what you will.\u201d The candidates are asked about diversity and LGBT rights \u2013 are they issues that are important to Tories? Both respond that they are proud of their record on the latter while in government. As Johnson finishes a point about having changed the rules to allow British embassies to fly the Rainbow Flag because the country must stand for its values, he is asked if he will, therefore, apologise for writing about \u201ctank-topped bumboys in the Ministry of Sound\u201d in a column. If you\u2019re going to excavate and disinter every single quotation from the millions of words I have written, you can of course try and twist things one way or another but I have a very proud record. He claims he was one of only a small number of Tories to support gay marriage when he was first elected to Parliament. Next question: How will each convince the public they are not simply \u201cself-serving posh boys\u201d. Johnson goes first, saying he will win trust by pushing through Brexit, then by pursuing classic conservative policies, such as backing business. \u201cAs a Charterhouse boy, I\u2019m never going to criticise Boris for going to Eton,\u201d Hunt replies \u2013 adding that the party has not done enough on attracting people. That\u2019s because it hasn\u2019t looked at issues like the cost of living, Hunt says. Asked about the possibility of the UK joining in hypothetical future US military strikes on Iran, both of the candidates say they don\u2019t believe such an outcome is likely and they do not seek a confrontation with the country. The candidates are asked if they back Theresa May\u2019s criticism of Donald Trump. The US president used racist language to attack Democratic congresswomen at the weekend. Hunt says he does and says he would be furious if someone spoke about his children in such terms. Johnson says relations between the two nations are important but that the US president \u201csimply cannot\u201d use such language. He repeatedly refuses to say explicitly whether or not he considers the remarks racist. Hunt says that, as foreign secretary, it wouldn\u2019t be helpful to use that term in reference to the US president. Johnson is asked whether or not he\u2019ll stand up to Donald Trump and asked about the Sir Kim Darroch case. Johnson repeats his line that he was sad to see Darroch resign and, after having influenced that decision by publicly and repeatedly refusing to explicitly back him, he claims he now does support the UK\u2019s outgoing envoy. The final question on Brexit: How likely is a trade deal with US? Hunt says it\u2019s \u201cvery likely\u201d and claims the Trump White House is very enthusiastic about such a move. He says \u201cwe are not going to put the NHS up for sale\u201d and says Trump\u2019s comments on the NHS were \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d. Trump initially said: \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing on trade, everything is on the table. So NHS or anything else. A lot more than that.\u201d Then he changed his mind, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t see [the NHS] being on the table. Somebody asked me a question today and I say everything is up for negotiation, because everything is. But that\u2019s something I would not see as part of trade. That\u2019s not trade.\u201d Read more on that here: Johnson says \u201cwe can start trade negotiations right away\u201d. It\u2019s pointed out to him that that\u2019s illegal and he clarifies that he means immediately after Brexit. He says the US is \u201cruthless\u201d in negotiations and will be \u201cvery, very tough\u201d. But he says the UK can nevertheless do a good deal and that he will not import goods that reduce UK standards. The candidates are asked whether they would prefer a second referendum or a general election if they cannot push through Brexit. Hunt says he will accept neither option and that\u2019s the reason for his refusal to set a hard deadline for Brexit. If he did set one, he says, he would have no option but to call a general election if Parliament blocked his deal. Johnson agrees that neither option is attractive and rules out any general election until Brexit is delivered. It\u2019s perhaps worth noting at this point that, should Brexit be delayed be a significant period, Johnson\u2019s hands would be tied on that point by the Fixed Term Parliaments Act. The candidates are asked how the Good Friday Agreement can be respected in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Johnson refers to a \u201cspirit of optimism\u201d and repeats his claims that the border discussions should be part of the free trade agreement negotiations. Hunt says there cannot be a hard border and that the technology exists to avoid one. But, he acknowledges, such measures are not going to be ready in time for Brexit, meaning there will be a gap. Johnson reiterates his claim that the border question can and should be answered during free trade negotiations \u2013 not as part of the withdrawal agreement. However, Channel 4 News\u2019 FactCheck quotes the European Commission\u2019s spokesperson as saying that \u201cit is possible to rework the Political Declaration on the framework of the future EU-UK relationship, but the Withdrawal Agreement [the deal struck by Theresa May] is not open for renegotiation\u201d. In other words, Johnson is claiming the EU will agree to do something it has explicitly and repeatedly said on the record it has no intention of doing. Johnson is asked how costly a no-deal Brexit would be. He refuses to say whether or not he has costed it, adding that the \u201cTreasury will come up with spine-chilling figures\u201d, but that the cost can be minimised if the UK prepares. Hunt says there are \u201creal costs for businesses\u201d that will not go away. He says he will hand \u00a36bn to farming and fishing communities to minimise the costs. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you can say they\u2019re vanishingly small.\u201d What if the Commons blocks a no-deal Brexit, they are asked? Hunt says his \u201cPlan A\u201d is to avoid such a scenario by securing a deal. He also attacks Johnson over his record while in cabinet, pointing out that he did not resign when the backstop plan was put in place and then subsequently voted for it once (while he acknowledges he voted for it three times). Newton Dunn asks if net immigration will come down under each of the candidates. Johnson says he wants control but refuses to say it will fall. Hunt agrees that control is the point but says people wanted overall levels of net migration to fall when they voted for Brexit. He claims not reduce net levels of immigration would be a betrayal and says the UK must train people currently in the country in order to reduce its reliance on migration to fill key jobs. Johnson says it\u2019s important not to send out a signal to the EU that the UK\u2019s willing to contemplate a further delay. The Sun\u2019s political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, asks if it\u2019s not unreasonable to suggest there\u2019s sufficient time to renegotiate a deal that took two years to negotiate in the first place. Johnson responds that he believes there\u2019s willingness within the EU to do a deal. And he says the UK must prepare for a no deal or risk lacking credibility on the continent. Hunt says he shares the enthusiasm for leaving on 31 October, saying that failing to leave at the end of March was a low-point for British politics. But he says Johnson\u2019s promising something he knows he cannot deliver when he pledges to leave at the end of October regardless of whether or not there\u2019s a deal in place. The foreign secretary says his plan his to be more flexible on the deadline if there\u2019s some sort of deal in place \u2013 though not quite finalised \u2013 at the end of September. The first half of the debate will address questions on Brexit. Luke Black, a Tory member, gets the first question: How can the candidates convince young Tories they are the person to push Brexit through? Johnson says he offers \u201cclarity of purpose\u201d to which the EU will respond. Hunt says he the real question is: \u201cWho has the plan?\u201d Both he and Johnson are willing to pursue no-deal, he says, but it\u2019s high-risk. There\u2019s less risk in sending a prime minister to Brussels to negotiate a deal. One presumes he means himself. The debate begins with one-minute opening statements from the two candidates. Johnson goes first, kicking off with his familiar \u201cget Brexit done\u201d line. Then he moves on to claim he has a plan to win people round to conservatism. Hunt says he too wants to \u201cdeliver Brexit\u201d and \u201cstop Corbyn\u201d. He says people who \u201cthink with their heads as well as their hearts\u201d will favour his plan for the former. And he says he wants to convince more young people to vote for the Conservatives. The head-to-head debate between Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson is about to get underway. We\u2019ll bring you updates from that as they come in. Numerous reports are now coming through that a shadow cabinet meeting will be convened on Monday \u2013 as requested by the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 to discuss claims of antisemitism within the Labour party. Jeremy Corbyn will then face the parliamentary Labour party (PLP). Starmer has demanded that the party work with the EHRC to shine a light on the claims. And Cryer, the PLP\u2019s chair, reportedly had some serious criticism of his own party at this evening\u2019s meeting: An update from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand on that video footage he said showed the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, apparently trying to avoid the cameras after addressing party staff: And there are reports of confrontation at this evening\u2019s PLP meeting over Labour\u2019s response to antisemitism allegations: Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, has posted an interesting Twitter thread looking at what concessions Boris Johnson might get out of Europe. In short - not much, he thinks, but do read the whole thread. It starts here. And last night he published this Brexit forecast. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. This is from Naz Shah, the shadow minister for women, commenting on our story about Boris Johnson arguing in an essay some years ago that Islam caused the Muslim world to be \u201cliterally centuries behind\u201d the west. (See 5.03pm.) Shah said: This is as historically inaccurate as it is Islamophobic. Boris Johnson must fully apologise for his record of racist remarks. After his previous comments describing women wearing the burqa as \u2018letterboxes\u2019 and \u2018bankrobbers\u2019, which has been linked to a rise in hate crime targeting Muslim women, Johnson\u2019s disgraceful views make him unfit to be an MP, let alone prime minister. His words will embolden the Islamophobes who, according to recent polling, make up over half of Conservative party members, who are about to choose the next prime minister of our country. From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand Theresa May held a roundtable in Downing Street today with representatives from the car industry. Number 10 has just sent out a press release that reads a bit like another attempt to define a legacy of sorts for her premiership. Here is an extract. The prime minister also set out a number of new commitments aimed at making electric vehicles more convenient than ever before to own, which were welcomed by attendees including: making England the first place in the world where every new-build home will be fitted with an electric car chargepoint, under a consultation launched today bringing forward plans to regulate chargepoints so that they use \u2018smart\u2019 technology which will send signals to electric vehicles to charge them at different times of the day, encouraging off-peak charging to keep costs down for consumers and helping prepare the energy system for mass uptake of electric vehicles all new rapid and higher powered chargepoints to provide \u2018pay as you go\u2019 debit or credit card payment options by spring 2020 \u2013 ending the current wide variety of payment systems which is a source of frustration for drivers The prime minister reaffirmed the government\u2019s ambition for better access to rapid chargepoints by 2030, following her recent announcement that the office of low emission vehicles will undertake a review to develop a vision for a core network of rapid chargepoints along England\u2019s key roadways. This would allow drivers to access them in a range of locations across the road network, including through and around cities. But one of the biggest issues for the car industry is Brexit, and in particular how no-deal would threaten the just-in-time supply chains used by factories in Britain. The press notice does not mention the risk of no-deal at all. Boris Johnson has been strongly criticised for arguing Islam has caused the Muslim world to be \u201cliterally centuries behind\u201d the west, in an essay unearthed by the Guardian, Frances Perraudin reports. At the risk of over-doing the Matthew Parris references today, Frances\u2019 story is a very good example of a Johnson trait that Parris described in his Times\u2019 column on Saturday (paywall). It is a very perceptive article on an essential Johnson trait. Here\u2019s an extract. There is communism; there is capitalism, Conservatism, Catholicism \u2014 and there is columnism. It\u2019s a cast of mind. Its practitioners are a type. First, foremost and for ever, Boris will be a columnist. The reflections on his and my trade which follow should be read also as thoughts on Johnson himself. Columnism is striking poses which (as any method actor will tell you) will only convince others if you yourself can temporarily inhabit the belief. You are counsel for the prosecution or defence of an idea, or dream, or fear, hatred, party or politician. You take a brief, elbow doubt and ambiguity aside, and go \u2014 joyously or ferociously but always (in the moment) with passion and conviction \u2014 full pelt. What columnism is not is making absolutely sure first that you\u2019re right. To be frank, you sometimes rather doubt it. Columnism is embracing a plan or project as a faithless man might embrace a woman: with an intensity no less sincere for being passing, ever-ready to flip the project or lady once their usefulness is past. It is hugging a set of principles fiercely to your breast while (should these principles not work out) keeping a wandering eye out for some spare ones down the back of the sofa. With parliament deadlocked over Brexit, there is growing interest in the idea that citizens\u2019 assemblies could be used to find policy solutions to problems that cannot be resolved by MPs. Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, has been arguing for almost a year that a citizens\u2019 assembly could provide a solution to Brexit. Rory Stewart put the same idea at the heart of his Brexit plan during his short-lived bid for the Conservative party leadership. And the Guardian is also formally backing the idea. Unfortunately a Guardian endorsement does not always mean an idea is actually going to happen, and both possible future Tory leaders, as well as Jeremy Corbyn, have expressed no interest at all in using citizens\u2019 assemblies. But, not for the first time, progressive initiatives are being introduced first in Scotland and Wales. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has already announced that she is setting up a citizens\u2019 assembly to consider what kind of country Scotland should be in the future, and how it should handle Brexit. And today the Welsh assembly has announced that Wales\u2019 first citizens\u2019 assembly will meet for the first time in Newton, for three days starting from 19 July. Some 60 citizens were selected to take part, from a pool of 10,000 families randomly invited to apply, and they will consider ways to improve the democratic process in Wales. It is part of a series of events to mark 20 years of devolution. Elin Jones, the assembly\u2019s presiding officer, said: The first citizens\u2019 assembly for Wales is a landmark event and an important step on our devolution journey. Public engagement is at the heart of the national assembly\u2019s work. We want people in all parts of Wales to get involved with the democratic process by sharing their views and ideas with us. For a democracy to thrive and improve, everyone must be involved. The Citizens\u2019 Assembly is a pioneering way in which we can make sure our work is in line with the priorities of people across the country. Here is the story by my colleagues Rowena Mason and Jessica Elgot on the offer by Labour peers to help Jeremy Corbyn address the antisemitism issue. And here is the full text of the peers\u2019 letter. These are from my colleague Rowena Mason. In an article for the Big Issue, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and Tory leadership candidate, says as PM he would spend \u00a330m rolling out a new approach to homelessness in London and two other cities. He explains: I want to roll out the Housing First Approach that has been trailed in the West Midlands, Liverpool and Manchester. This approach operates on the basis of two key principles. That housing is basic human right, and that once homelessness is resolved other clinical and social issues will be resolved faster. It essentially means adopting the following approach \u2013 Immediate or near immediate access to permanent accommodation for people on the streets without a housing readiness assessment. No preconditions of treatment access or engagement are required to get this accommodation. They get unconditional access to whatever treatment they need. I don\u2019t think we have time to wait for the results of these pilots. So I will commit an extra \u00a330m to roll it out immediately in London and at least two other UK cities. That could help at least an extra 1000 people off the streets. This would be an immediate step-change but longer-term I will publish a full cross-government strategy to use every lever at my power to eradicate this scourge. And this is from the Labour MP David Lammy on the Trump tweets. This is from Nick Boles, the former Conservative MP who now sits as an independent. This is from Tortoise\u2019s Polly Curtis, who has been watching the morning news programmes in New York. Theresa May has criticised Donald Trump\u2019s \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d language towards four Democratic congresswomen, which has been condemned for racism, putting pressure on her likely successor, Boris Johnson, to speak out as well. The Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has urged Johnson and Jeremy Hunt to denounce Trump in similar terms. (See 12.06pm.) Downing Street has refused to stand up for the right of journalists to publish leaked official documents in the public interest after police warned last week that editors could face prosecution if they reveal any further diplomatic cables from the British ambassador to the US, Kim Darroch. Jeremy Hunt, the underdog in the Tory leadership contest, has rejected claims that Boris Johnson\u2019s victory next week is inevitable. More than 200 current and former Labour staffers, party members and supporters have written an open letter to Jeremy Corbyn challenging him to justify his handling of the antisemitism issue, Sky News is reporting. The signatories argue that if Corbyn is not prepared to face questions in public on this matter \u201cfrom an experienced interviewer\u201d, people will conclude he is not fit to lead a Labour government. (It sounds like they are hoping this might be another assignment for Andrew Neil.) Ursula von der Leyen, the woman seeking to replace Jean-Claude Juncker as the European commission president, has made last-minute pledges on the climate crisis, Brexit, an EU minimum wage and gender quotas for company boards as she faces a knife-edge vote on her candidacy. The Home Office lied to EU member states to remove victims of human trafficking and modern slavery in breach of European law, according to whistleblowers. This is from my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels. UK in a Changing Europe, an academic network, have been holding a Brexit conference today. Here are some of the highlights. You can read the full text of the speech from Bernard Jenkin, the Tory Brexiter and chairman of the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee, here. Gus O\u2019Donnell is a former cabinet secretary. Sir Vince Cable, the outgoing Lib Dem leader, has just told the BBC\u2019s Politics Live that he expects to see more MPs defecting to his party \u201cbefore the summer is out\u201d. There were a small number of Tory and Labour MPs who have given up on their parties, he said. But he would not be drawn on reports that the Tory MPs Phillip Lee and Guto Bebb are poised to switch if (as expected) Boris Johnson becomes party leader next week. Jo Swinson, a candidate in the Lib Dem leadership contest, has denounced President Trump as a racist. Nadhim Zahawi, an education minister and a supporter of Boris Johnson, told the BBC\u2019s Politics Live that he thought President Trump\u2019s tweets were \u201cinappropriate\u201d. But he would not describe them as racist, and argued that British politicians should not get involved in domestic internal politics, BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham reports. UPDATE: Here\u2019s the clip. From my colleague Jessica Elgot UPDATE: PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield has the text of the motion. Theresa May is famously reserved. Even before she became prime minister she was notorious amongst journalists for her reluctance to any anything indiscreet - Nick Robinson once turned down a lunch with her when she was home secretary and he was BBC political editor because he thought it would be a waste of time - and as PM she has got through countless interviews giving almost nothing away. But another rather less well-known characteristic of hers is that she is, in the words of Tory journalist Matthew Parris, \u201ca good hater\u201d. As Parris explained last year in a very good Times article (paywall) about his various encounters with her: I learnt that this well-mannered woman was a good hater. At the mention of a particular colleague\u2019s name her lip curled, she made no attempt to conceal her dislike, and rather seemed to enjoy the disdain. In her final days in office this side of May\u2019s character seems to be coming out - at least, a little. The Number 10 lobby briefing this morning (see 11.48am) seems to give a clue as to what she really feels about the US president who showed his gratitude for a state visit by insulting her in public. I can think of three other examples in recent weeks where she gave a glimpse of who else is on her hate list. 1 - Jeremy Corbyn. May has often denounced Corbyn at PMQs, but two weeks ago there seemed to be an added bitterness in her voice as she effectively accused him of hypocrisy, saying Labour had no right to criticise no-deal when it repeatedly voted down her own proposed Brexit deal. 2 - Nicola Sturgeon. Barack Obama once said that the only people determined to obstruct anything he did, regardless of their own interests, were Vladimir Putin and congressional Republicans. In a recent speech in Edinburgh, May said something broadly similar about Sturgeon and the Scottish government. 3 - Boris Johnson. May has been reluctant to criticise her likely successor directly, but just occasionally we get a clue as to what she may be thinking privately. There was a good example on Friday when she spoke out about people who think being PM is all about power, not service. It was not hard to decipher who she meant Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, says Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt should both also condemn President Trump\u2019s racist tweets. (See 11.48am.) So far both Johnson and Hunt have been silent on this. (See 11.17am.) Unusually Theresa May, via her press secretary, managed to issue a condemnation of President Trump\u2019s latest outrage before Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, who is normally much more ready to denounce him. But Sturgeon has now issued her own criticism on Twitter. This is from the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley who is just back from the Downing Street lobby. Here is the Guardian story about how Donald Trump posted a racist tweet on Sunday attacking four progressive Democratic congresswomen, telling them to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came\u201d. And here are the Trump tweets. What\u2019s remarkable about this is that, until now, Theresa May has been extremely reluctant to criticise Donald Trump. Perhaps her stance has shifted in response to what he had to say about her last week. Here\u2019s a reminder. Sir Vince Cable has got a new job for when he stands down as leader of the Liberal Democrats next week. Birmingham City University has just announced that he will be joining them as a visiting professor at their Centre for Brexit Studies. \u201cSir Vince will take up the position this summer and will focus on looking at the economics and scenarios related to Britain\u2019s exit from the EU,\u201d the university says. From BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham This week the Guardian is running a series called the real Boris Johnson. You can read all today\u2019s articles here. They are all good, including Jennifer Rankin and Jim Waterson\u2019s article about how he made his names as a Brussels correspondent filing wilfully misleading stories about the EU. On the same theme, Martin Fletcher has written an article for Tortoise listing some of those exaggerated stories. But the highlight is probably this final paragraph, from the further reading box. Last year Der Spiegel admitted that one of its star reporters, Claas Relotius had likely embellished reports and fabricated entire events for years. He apologised, was stripped of various awards, and is not currently running for high office in Germany. In his Daily Telegraph column (paywall) Boris Johnson says that, if he becomes prime minister, his first budget would include tax breaks for firms that spend money helping their employees deal with stress and mental health problems. He says: As things stand, mental health and occupational health services are taxable as benefits in kind. That means they incur both income tax and national insurance. At most, employers can get a modest reimbursement of \u00a3500, but only if an employee is off for more than 28 days \u2013 a hopeless incentive, since the whole objective should be to keep the employee in the workplace, or to ensure that time off is as brief as possible. So let me make a suggestion. I believe it is time to offer preferential tax treatment to companies that look after employees in work \u2013 giving them the counselling and the help they need to do their jobs. It is time for the Treasury and the NHS to work together to review the rules. And if they can come up with a plan \u2013 and I am sure that they can \u2013 we should put it into effect this autumn in what, if I am lucky enough to be elected, would be the first budget of the new government. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has insisted that the Iran nuclear deal is not yet dead. Speaking ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, and referring to the agreement, he said: Well, it isn\u2019t dead yet. And we are totally committed to keeping the Middle East denuclearised. If Iran acquires nuclear weapons then other countries in the region will acquire nuclear weapons. It becomes a very, very toxic and dangerous situation. We are looking to find a way to preserve the nuclear deal. Iran is still a good year away from developing a nuclear weapon. We think there is still some closing but small window to keep the deal alive, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m here to talk about. What we are looking for is to give Iran a way out of this so that they can get back into compliance with that nuclear deal. Here are my colleagues John Crace and Marina Hyde on Liam Fox\u2019s Today interview. In his Today interview Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, also said there was no need for Sir Kim Darroch, the ambassador to Washington, to be replaced by a career diplomat. A politician could do the job, he suggested. I\u2019ve always thought that we should be using a wider range of people in some of our diplomatic posts ... Some senior members of parliament have gone on to take up posts, for example the high commission in Australia, and have been very successful at doing so. It did sound a bit as though Fox, an Americanophile with extensive Washington contacts, might be putting in a bid for the job himself, although given that he is supporting Jeremy Hunt in the Tory leadership contest, he is unlikely to feature on Boris Johnson\u2019s list of suitable candidates. The Times story saying that Boris Johnson would try to agree a partial UK-US trade deal by 31 October, covering just one area of trade, is sourced to an unnamed ally of Johnson\u2019s. (See 9.20am.) Asked to comment by the paper, the Johnson campaign did not confirm or deny the story, but insisted they were just focusing on winning the leadership election. However, this morning campaign sources are being more definitive. \u201cIt\u2019s not from us,\u201d a senior figure told me, adding that the story was \u201cnonsense\u201d. In his Today interview Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, was also asked about a recent claim by Boris Johnson, the favourite in the Tory leadership contest, that the UK should try to get the US to adopt British food standards in a trade deal. At a hustings last week Johnson said: I don\u2019t want us to do any deal with the US which in anyway jeopardises our animal welfare standards or our food hygiene standards. The quality of food in this country must be protected and if anything we should be insisting that if the Americans want to trade with us they should be obeying our standards. When asked if he thought this was realistic, Fox told Today: Well, I think if you go to the US and you say we are going to take any discussions on agricultural access off the agenda, you\u2019ll find that they close down pretty quickly in terms of their willingness to discuss things. When you go into a trade negotiation, both sides will have their asks, both sides will have their defensive elements, but it is certainly true that we should be trying to get an agreement with the United States as quickly as we possibly can. Today the Times splashes on a story (paywall) claiming that Boris Johnson plans to make \u201cresetting relations with President Trump one of his first acts in Downing Street\u201d and that he wants to negotiated a limited trade deal with the US in time for when the UK leaves the EU on 31 October. Here\u2019s an extract. Under plans being discussed by Mr Johnson\u2019s team he would strike a limited trade deal in \u201cone area\u201d of goods in time for October 31. He and Mr Trump would also establish the broad outlines of a fully fledged deal. \u201cThere is no question that the moment we leave on the 31st we should be in a position to get some kind of arrangement with the US,\u201d the source said. But on the Today programme this morning Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, who is backing Jeremy Hunt for the Tory leadership, said that Johnson\u2019s plan was impossible. He explained: We can\u2019t negotiate anything with the US until after we\u2019ve left the European Union ... It would be in breach of European law for us to do that. Negotiating a UK-US trade deal would take time, he said. He went on: You\u2019ve got the added complication, just remember, that we\u2019re now getting very close to the American pre-election year where it is quite hard to get things through congress. So even if you negotiate them quickly, you would not necessarily be able to ratify them. In the interview Fox also dismissed another Johnson proposal, for the UK to insist that any trade deal requires the US to match UK food standards. I will post the relevant quotes in a moment. UPDATE: This morning the Johnson camp has described the Times story about an early, partial trade deal with the US as \u201cnonsense\u201d. (See 9.32am.) Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, gives a speech on violent crime. As Vikram Dodd reports, he will argue that serious youth violence, such as stabbings and shootings, is strongly connected to social exclusion and austerity. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Sajid Javid, the home secretary, takes questions from the Commons. 7pm: Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt take part in a debate hosted by the Sun. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime and then another when I finish. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "It could just have been overconfidence. More likely it was a white flag. A giving in to the inevitable. For the final head-to-head debate in the Tory leadership race, Team Hunt hadn\u2019t sent a single MP out into the spin room to explain why their man was about to win. Not even Liam Fox, who bizarrely had managed to out fact-check Boris Johnson on the status of a UK-US trade deal that very morning. It\u2019s come to something when the country depends on the international trade secretary \u2013 for the next week at least \u2013 as a voice of sanity. For Team Boris, Dominic Raab was looking every bit like a man who won\u2019t be taking public transport for much longer. The shiny ministerial limo awaits. Gone was the pent-up anger of his own failed leadership bid. The bulging neck veins of Captain Psycho had given way to Smiley Dom. The man whose road rage convictions are now spent and on whom no one has yet pinned any unsolved murders. This was a man happy in his own skin. A politician of hitherto hidden charm. Pleased to have chosen the winning side. Delighted his no-deal Brexit was now mainstream Conservative policy. As Amber Rudd was now desperate to phone in and confirm. When she\u2019d said a no-deal Brexit would be a disaster what she had really meant was that it would be an unmitigated success. This was the Sun-Talk Radio debate and Sun political editor Tom Newton Dunn laid down a few ground rules for Johnson and Hunt. The first of which was that there should be no repeat of last week\u2019s ITV debates when both men had talked over each other and Julie Etchingham. Boris and Jeremy nodded furiously. This time there were no woman involved so there would be no need to talk over anyone. \u201cPifflepafflewifflewaffle,\u201d Boris began in his by now well-rehearsed opening patter.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have joined Theresa May in condemning Donald Trump\u2019s tweets suggesting four Democratic congresswomen should \u201cgo back and help fix\u201d their \u201cbroken and crime-infested\u201d countries, but all held back from branding him a racist. The two Conservative leadership hopefuls made clear their criticism of Trump in a Sun and TalkRadio leadership debate, echoing May\u2019s comments that they were \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. Asked for his views, Johnson, the runaway favourite to succeed May as prime minister next week, said: \u201cRelations between the UK and US are incredibly important. But if you are the leader of a great multiracial, multicultural country you simply cannot use that kind of language about sending people back to where they came from. It went out decades and decades ago and thank heavens for that. It\u2019s totally unacceptable.\u201d Pressed on whether he agreed with May, Hunt said: \u201cYes I do. I have three half-Chinese children and if anyone ever said to them, \u2018Go back to China\u2019 I would be utterly appalled. It is totally un-British to do that. So I hope that would never happen in this country.\u201d They were each asked whether Trump should be called a racist because of his comments but Hunt, the foreign secretary, and Johnson, a former foreign secretary, both declined to use that term. Earlier, May took the unusual step of commenting on US domestic politics after Trump made reference to the outspoken Democratic congresswomen, only one of whom is foreign-born. The president\u2019s remarks were attacked as explicitly racist towards Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, who was born in Somalia. The speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, denounced Trump\u2019s \u201cxenophobic comments meant to divide our nation\u201d, while the four congresswomen accused him of trying to appeal to white nationalists. Downing Street criticised Trump\u2019s comments but stopped short of branding him a racist. \u201cHer view is that the language which was used to refer to the women was completely unacceptable,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said. Trump was highly critical of May last week, saying she had made a \u201cmess\u201d of Brexit, following leaked diplomatic cables from the UK ambassador to Washington that described him as inept and insecure. Johnson, who was condemned for his failure to defend the ambassador, Sir Kim Darroch, is keen to rebuild the relationship with the US after the serious diplomatic row. Johnson has claimed he said nothing that should have been a factor in the ambassador\u2019s decision to quit, but that is not an assessment shared in Whitehall or by Darroch. Trump had condemned Darroch and sought to ostracise him in an attempt to punish the envoy and apparently to drive him from his job. The latest row about Trump\u2019s remarks is a test case of how far the next prime minister will put what they regard as the national economic interest and the pursuit of the special relationship ahead of defending essential British values and principles. There is a fear that with Brexit imminent, an increasingly isolated UK will have to turn more towards a Trump-led administration in its search for key allies. May\u2019s condemnation of Trump is a further sign the prime minister is willing to loosen the shackles in the final days of her premiership and say what she thinks. The Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, said earlier that May was right and \u201cboth men vying to be her successor should say so\u201d. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the president\u2019s comments were \u201cnot OK and diplomatic politeness should not stop us saying so, loudly and clearly\u201d. Nadhim Zahawi, the MP for Stratford-on-Avon and a supporter of Johnson, said the UK should not interject into American politics, but described the language used as inappropriate. \u201cIt is not language I would use. I am condemning it,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cIt is domestic US policy. Ultimately, if we do this [interject], we will give Donald Trump the right to intervene in our politics any time he wants. That is not where we want to be. This is our greatest ally. The president of the US has to be someone with whom the prime minister can work, and if we are going to start behaving in this way and attack them all the time then they have every right to do the same back to us.\u201d",

As an island nation, we have decimated the navy so it is no longer able to fulfil one of its prime purposes, which is as important today as it has been for centuries.

It would form the heart of a new cycle network that would decrease obesity, reduce air pollution and present an alternative to car use in an area where not many people currently cycle.</p> <p>They argue that the plans to abandon the tunnel are now estimated to cost at least \u00a35m of public money, whereas the repairs are estimated to cost up to \u00a36.9m. Sustrans, the environmental charity, has produced <a href=\"http://www.queensburytunnel.org.uk/reports/SustransEconomicImpactStudy.pdf\">a report</a> suggesting the Queensbury cycle route could bring \u00a337.6m worth of economic, health and tourism benefits over 30 years.</p> <p>Highway England\u2019s contractor began strengthening vulnerable parts of the tunnel last year before the main phase of work, which requires planning permission. However, the cost of that work has shot up after Highways England failed to pay the \u00a350 annual rent on a pumping station that keeps the tunnel free from water, resulting in the pump being switched off and the tunnel flooding with 8.2m gallons of water, according to Graeme Bickerdike, who coordinates the Queensbury Tunnel Society\u2019s engineering activities.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThanks to a combination of fear, ignorance, hysteria and occasional outbreaks of incompetence, Highways England has cost the taxpayers a huge amount of money.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cAs we look at our environmental and health responsibilities, we need to facilitate people getting out of cars and on to bikes, which means providing the infrastructure for it.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners are supported by Bradford and Calverdale councils and local MPs. Holly Lynch, the MP for Halifax, has said restoring the tunnel would return \u00a32.31 in benefits for every \u00a31 invested. In a letter to Bradford council, she says this is a \u201creturn that is regarded by the government as high value for money\u201d.</p> <p>Judith Cummins, the MP for Bradford South, has written to Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, to call on the government to intervene. She argues that filling in the tunnel is \u201cjust so directly at odds with the government\u2019s cycling and walking strategy\u201d. During a debate on cycle and walking paths last week, she said: \u201cThe tunnel should be the jewel in the crown of a new cycle and walk greenway to connect the great city of Bradford with Halifax. We should be taking advantage of our historical assets to benefit all of us for years to come.\u201d</p> <p>A decision on whether planning permission will be granted is expected later this month.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Highways England said: \u201cWe have now submitted our planning application to Bradford council for further safety work to close Queensbury tunnel.</p> <p>\u201cAll the comments that have been received so far will help the council make their decision and we would like to thank everyone for taking the time to comment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The campaign to turn a disused railway line in Yorkshire into England\u2019s longest cycle tunnel has received a boost in the form of a defiant landowner who refuses to let it stay shut. A row has erupted over the 1.4-mile (2.3km) Queensbury line between campaigners, supported by the local councils, and the Department for Transport (DfT), which wants to fill in sections of the tunnel with concrete and then leave it to collapse. David Sunderland, who says he owns the land at one end of the Queensbury tunnel, will not grant access to allow any works to proceed. Alongside nearly 3,500 other objections on Bradford council\u2019s planning website, he wrote that he would not cooperate with any works to abandon Queensbury tunnel, describing it as \u201can important and valuable public asset\u201d. In response to the application to fill in the tunnel from Highways England, which manages the tunnel for the DfT, he says he will not grant access to the land unless the proposal for a cycle path goes ahead. The campaigners say there is a \u201conce-only opportunity\u201d to turn the tunnel, disused since 1956, into a subterranean walking and cycling route connecting Halifax to Bradford and Keighley. It would form the heart of a new cycle network that would decrease obesity, reduce air pollution and present an alternative to car use in an area where not many people currently cycle. They argue that the plans to abandon the tunnel are now estimated to cost at least \u00a35m of public money, whereas the repairs are estimated to cost up to \u00a36.9m. Sustrans, the environmental charity, has produced a report suggesting the Queensbury cycle route could bring \u00a337.6m worth of economic, health and tourism benefits over 30 years. Highway England\u2019s contractor began strengthening vulnerable parts of the tunnel last year before the main phase of work, which requires planning permission. However, the cost of that work has shot up after Highways England failed to pay the \u00a350 annual rent on a pumping station that keeps the tunnel free from water, resulting in the pump being switched off and the tunnel flooding with 8.2m gallons of water, according to Graeme Bickerdike, who coordinates the Queensbury Tunnel Society\u2019s engineering activities. He said: \u201cThanks to a combination of fear, ignorance, hysteria and occasional outbreaks of incompetence, Highways England has cost the taxpayers a huge amount of money.\u201d He added: \u201cAs we look at our environmental and health responsibilities, we need to facilitate people getting out of cars and on to bikes, which means providing the infrastructure for it.\u201d Campaigners are supported by Bradford and Calverdale councils and local MPs. Holly Lynch, the MP for Halifax, has said restoring the tunnel would return \u00a32.31 in benefits for every \u00a31 invested. In a letter to Bradford council, she says this is a \u201creturn that is regarded by the government as high value for money\u201d. Judith Cummins, the MP for Bradford South, has written to Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, to call on the government to intervene. She argues that filling in the tunnel is \u201cjust so directly at odds with the government\u2019s cycling and walking strategy\u201d. During a debate on cycle and walking paths last week, she said: \u201cThe tunnel should be the jewel in the crown of a new cycle and walk greenway to connect the great city of Bradford with Halifax. We should be taking advantage of our historical assets to benefit all of us for years to come.\u201d A decision on whether planning permission will be granted is expected later this month. A spokesperson for Highways England said: \u201cWe have now submitted our planning application to Bradford council for further safety work to close Queensbury tunnel. \u201cAll the comments that have been received so far will help the council make their decision and we would like to thank everyone for taking the time to comment.",

A Labour leadership that is incapable of dealing with antisemitism, propped up by MPs who hope the British public will do what they will not, and prevent them from getting into No 10. A Tory party that will select a prime minister who will tank their reputation for economic competence in a bid to deliver Brexit. The fracturing of electoral coalitions, ages old, which has led to four parties (including one that did not exist even six months ago) bobbing around in the polling doldrums at around 20% each.</p> <p>Nothing can be done, the moderately minded MPs of both legacy parties say, look at what Change UK did and take heed. Our failure is used as the proof point that something new can\u2019t emerge. And yet: in many respects, the case for a proper realignment is stronger than when we left our parties.</p> <p>I shoulder my share of the blame for soiling the pitch. To rush to establish a political party, as just 11 MPs, was an act of hubris. That logo! The <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39907963\" title=\"\">bus</a>! We took the kicking that we deserved, especially when our desire to stand in the EU elections seemed destined to split the remain vote. But to use our (predictably) poor showing as an excuse for inaction, is surely the most cynical response of all.</p> <p>We were never going to be able to provide a compelling, centre-ground, future-focused electoral offer on our own. The act of leaving our parties was the beginning of something, not an end in itself. But others still need to face up to their own dilemma in representing parties they believe are unfit for office.</p> <p>So \u2013 to the real point of this missive. To my former Labour colleagues (for the Tories\u2019 moment of reckoning will come in the autumn) let me say this: Don\u2019t let Change UK put you off from acting.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/labour-bosses-accused-of-undermining-fight-against-antisemitism-bbc-panorama\" title=\"\">last week\u2019s revelations</a>, you know everything you now need to about your leader. He isn\u2019t going to change: the shutting down of democratic processes and debate; his instincts on national security; the vacuum of leadership on Brexit; the stain of anti-Jewish racism in the party and his lack of interest in getting a grip. Truthfully, all this was visible the last time you <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36647458\" title=\"\">passed a vote of no confidence</a> in his leadership by a margin of four-to-one.</p> <p>Only two things have changed: his grip on the machinery of the party (insurmountably tighter) and his proximity to Downing Street (undeniably closer). The final foxhole that the moderate Labour MP will sink themselves into is \u201che\u2019s unelectable, so it doesn\u2019t matter\u201d. Even if this were the case, it should matter. But I think that assessment is also catastrophically wrong. This was the prevailing wisdom last time around, before Labour went on to gain seats and deny the Tories a majority.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/14/end-the-antisemitism-soap-opera-emily-thornberry-tells-labour\">End the antisemitism soap opera, Emily Thornberry tells Labour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If all you can come up with is stay and fight, you\u2019re actually going to need to do both.

But take a step back and honestly assess the bigger picture: huge political forces, surging through a parliament that cannot meet the enormity of the challenge it faces, are still present. A Labour leadership that is incapable of dealing with antisemitism, propped up by MPs who hope the British public will do what they will not, and prevent them from getting into No 10. A Tory party that will select a prime minister who will tank their reputation for economic competence in a bid to deliver Brexit. The fracturing of electoral coalitions, ages old, which has led to four parties (including one that did not exist even six months ago) bobbing around in the polling doldrums at around 20% each. Nothing can be done, the moderately minded MPs of both legacy parties say, look at what Change UK did and take heed. Our failure is used as the proof point that something new can\u2019t emerge. And yet: in many respects, the case for a proper realignment is stronger than when we left our parties. I shoulder my share of the blame for soiling the pitch. To rush to establish a political party, as just 11 MPs, was an act of hubris. That logo! The bus! We took the kicking that we deserved, especially when our desire to stand in the EU elections seemed destined to split the remain vote. But to use our (predictably) poor showing as an excuse for inaction, is surely the most cynical response of all. We were never going to be able to provide a compelling, centre-ground, future-focused electoral offer on our own. The act of leaving our parties was the beginning of something, not an end in itself. But others still need to face up to their own dilemma in representing parties they believe are unfit for office. So \u2013 to the real point of this missive. To my former Labour colleagues (for the Tories\u2019 moment of reckoning will come in the autumn) let me say this: Don\u2019t let Change UK put you off from acting. After last week\u2019s revelations, you know everything you now need to about your leader. He isn\u2019t going to change: the shutting down of democratic processes and debate; his instincts on national security; the vacuum of leadership on Brexit; the stain of anti-Jewish racism in the party and his lack of interest in getting a grip. Truthfully, all this was visible the last time you passed a vote of no confidence in his leadership by a margin of four-to-one. Only two things have changed: his grip on the machinery of the party (insurmountably tighter) and his proximity to Downing Street (undeniably closer). The final foxhole that the moderate Labour MP will sink themselves into is \u201che\u2019s unelectable, so it doesn\u2019t matter\u201d. Even if this were the case, it should matter. But I think that assessment is also catastrophically wrong. This was the prevailing wisdom last time around, before Labour went on to gain seats and deny the Tories a majority. If all you can come up with is stay and fight, you\u2019re actually going to need to do both. In 2016, the Parliamentary Labour party delivered 172 votes to challenge Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. Today\u2019s threshold is 52 MPs and MEPs, and the window for a challenge is closing. If you don\u2019t act now, you will be heading for a speculative autumn election, and campaigning to make a man you believe is unfit to lead your party the leader of our country. There are just 10 days to go before parliament slumps into its long summer \u2013 if you can get one in five of your colleagues to support a challenge to the leader of the opposition, you must act now. And if you can\u2019t clear even that low bar, then at least be honest with yourself \u2013 the fight is lost. All you\u2019re doing is staying and propping him up. History is not just shaped by action, but by inaction as well. \u2022 Gavin Shuker is the MP for Luton South and a member of the Independents \u2022 This article was amended on 15 July 2019 to clarify that the writer is arguing that antisemitism is an issue in the Labour party rather than the Labour leadership",

This is not the story of the Conservative leadership candidate\u2019s recent political career, his humbling at the hands of Michael Gove in 2016, or his sudden devotion to the Brexit cause \u2013 but of his first forays into student politics about 35 years ago, according to the man who beat him. Neil Sherlock, who went on to be an adviser to Nick Clegg when he was deputy prime minister, beat the young Johnson by more than 100 votes during a hard-fought campaign to become Oxford Union president in 1984, which framed him as a grammar-school-educated boy pitted against an Old Etonian establishment candidate.
