It hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>BJ</strong>: \u201cNobody said that we could change the, uh, the backstop that is,\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>RP</strong>: \u201cBut has it been done?\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>BJ</strong>: \u201cThat is now under serious negotiation.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>RP</strong>: \u201ct\u2019s under discussion but when I talk to people in European capitals. They are very sceptical. You\u2019ll get anything like what you want.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>BJ</strong>: \u201cWell, it is certainly true, Robert, that uh, the British negotiating position has been undermined by the so-called surrender bill. Well not \u2018so called\u2019 It is a surrender bill. Uh, the, the, the bill that says that we\u2019d have to rule out no deal. They\u2019ve tried to wreck our negotiating position, but we\u2019re not going to let them do it,</p> \n  <p>We\u2019re going to get on and negotiate a deal if we possibly can. And if we can\u2019t get up to you, then we\u2019re going to come out of the EU on October the 31st come what may.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>RP</strong>: \u201cBut you did say something that I thought was very interesting to MPs, which is, that you believe now that EU are agreeing to some mechanism. You\u2019ve got it, the principle of consent whereby whatever arrangements, if any arrangements to replace the backstop are agreed, they will be a way for Northern Ireland to get out of those arrangements. How would that work?\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>BJ</strong>: \u201cWell, I mean, this is, this is kind of where the rubber is hitting the road. Okay. The, the, the, the, the problem with the backstop is, is it, it\u2019s the, it\u2019s the arrangement, right?</p> \n  <p>Exactly. It\u2019s the arrangement that keeps the UK locked in the, uh, EU\u2019s legal order, the customs union and the single market with the EU having the say about our ability to exit. That\u2019s the problem with it. And it\u2019s just never going to go through the House of Commons. So we need to get rid of that.</p> \n  <p><strong>RP</strong>: \u201cBut do you get any sense, you were saying to some MPs that you think the EU will move on that. Genuinely?\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>BJ</strong>: \u201cYes, I do. And they already genuinely have moved in the sense that they\u2019re willing to consider other ways that allow us to work with our Irish friends to accomplish several things. Number one, we need to avoid any kind of border checks.\u201d</p> \n  <p>[...]</p> \n  <p><strong>RP</strong>: \u201c...the attorney general said today that you would abide by the so called Benn act, which says if you can\u2019t get a deal, you\u2019ve got to write to the EU requesting an extension. So you\u2019re going to write this letter, are you?</p> \n  <p><strong>BJ</strong>: \u201cWell we\u2019re going to go for a deal\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>RP</strong>: \u201cNo! No! He said you would abide by this law, that means you would have to write the letter if there is no deal?\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>BJ</strong>: \u201cThat of course only kicks in. If we fail to get a deal\u201d</p> \n  <p>RP: \u201cBut you\u2019re conceding there\u2019s a reasonable prospect you\u2019re not going to get a deal.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>BJ</strong>: \u201cAnd under these circumstances, what I can say to you is that we will respect the law and we will come out on October the 31st\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>RP</strong>: \u201cBut those two statements, many would say are completely incompatible\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>BJ</strong>: \u201cWell we will respect the law and we will come out on October 31st\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>RP</strong>: \u201cHow?\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>BJ:</strong> \u201cWell.

A few hours later <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> chose exactly the same hyper-aggressive approach. Having been found to have acted unlawfully by the supreme court, some humility might have been expected. But instead Johnson sounded utterly unrepentant, and instead his speech amounted highly-charged, after-dinner rant about Labour and the rest of the opposition, whom he accused of blocking Brexit.</p> \n  <p>Tory MPs loved it. And if the Number 10 strategy at the moment is all about depicting Johnson as a tribune of the Brexit-loving masses, taking on the courts and parliament, perhaps at one point, when the election comes, it will work. </p> \n  <p>But what was striking was that this appears to be about the only strategy Johnson has. Today Johnson had absolutely nothing to say about his Brexit negotiating strategy and he had absolutely nothing to say about his strategy for getting legislation through parliament. Jeremy Corbyn said the speech amounted to \u201c10 minutes of bluster\u201d, and he was right. All the alpha-male belligerent bravado was cover for the fact that the PM seems to be running out of options.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson challenged the opposition parties to call a vote of no confidence if they want a general election.</strong> He said he would make time for a motion tabled by a minor opposition party, not just Labour, to be debated. But the opposition parties want a guarantee that there will not be a no-deal Brexit on 31 October first, and so it is hard to see this offer being taken up.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson accused the opposition of being afraid of facing the public. </strong>This was undemocratic, he claimed. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s not just that this parliament is in gridlock, paralysed and refusing to deliver the priorities of the people. It\u2019s not just unable to move forward. It\u2019s worse than that \u2013 out of sheer selfishness and political cowardice members opposite are unwilling to move aside and give the people a say.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he wanted to offer voters a \u201clife after Brexit\u201d.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The public don\u2019t want another referendum \u2013 what they want and what they demand, is that we honour the promise we made to the voters to respect the first referendum.

She asked for an assurance that, if troops were going to be sent to the Gulf for military action, that the Commons would get a vote.</p> \n  <p><strong>Dominic Raab</strong>, the foreign secretary, claimed that there were no such plans. Responding to Thornberry, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[Thornberry] talked whether the UK would be sending troops to Saudia Arabia. There has been no suggestion of that at all. It is simply wrong for her to say it. What has been said is that the US is sending troops to Saudi Arabia to make sure that Saudi can protect itself from further attacks, or repeats of the attacks Aramco.</p> \n   <p>We have said that we would consider a request that we\u2019ve received for support in relation to air defences.

But we need to be absolutely unwavering and clear in our resolve that the only way that will happen is if Iran steps up and starts to meet its responsibilities.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The suggestion that the UK was considering sending troops to Saudia Arabia, emerged from what Boris Johnson said when he spoke to reporters on his flight to New York recently, although the headlines about troops being despatched (see <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/british-troops-could-deployed-saudi-20148091\">here </a>and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9983177/boris-johnson-troops-gulf-iran/\">here</a>) did not necessarily match what was actually being proposed.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d8ba36d8f081108db9bcb2c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-25T17:31:37.544Z\">6.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson expected to challenge opposition parties to table no-confidence motion</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>According to a leak of what Boris Johnson is due to say in his statement to MPs shortly, he will challenge the opposition parties to table a motion of no confidence in the government.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/25/what-happens-next-in-parliament-after-supreme-court-ruling\">full guide is here</a>, but here are the answers to a few key questions: </p> \n  <h2><strong>What\u2019s happening with parliament on Wednesday?</strong></h2> \n  <p>The president of the UK\u2019s highest court, Lady Hale, announced on Tuesday that \u201cparliament has not been prorogued\u201d. The unanimous judgment of all 11 justices was that it was for parliament - and particularly the speakers of both houses - to decide what to do next. Commons Speaker John Bercow has already said that parliament must be reconvened as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/24/bercow-mps-return-urgent-supreme-court-ruling-suspension-parliament\">\u201cmatter of urgency\u201d</a>and that MPs will sit at 11.30am. The usual Wednesday session of prime minister\u2019s questions would not take place, he said, although there would be opportunities for MPs to hold the Government to account.</p> \n  <h2>What does it mean for Brexit?</h2> \n  <p>Corbyn was meeting the leaders of the Scottish Nationalists, Lib Dems and other opposition parties last night to work out how to exert maximum pressure to achieve their number one goal: making sure Johnson cannot escape the legal obligation set out in the Benn-Burt bill to delay Brexit if he has not reached a deal of any description by 19 October. Johnson has always insisted<strong> </strong>he will not request an extension of article 50 and may be hoping that the EU summit on 17 October will provide a breakthrough.</p> \n  <p>Government ministers have repeatedly dodged questions about whether they think there are loopholes they could use to avoid complying with the Benn legislation. But it would risk another potentially humiliating legal battle with the courts if Johnson chose to go down that route. In a hint he could have another go at suspending parliament he said there was a \u201cgood case for getting on with a Queen\u2019s speech\u201d.</p> \n  <h2>Does any of this make an election more likely?</h2> \n  <p>Johnson would like to have an election as soon as possible, but he has failed to force the necessary legal instrument through parliament. As he put it, \u201cwe have a parliament that is unable to be prorogued\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to have an election\u201d. The opposition parties don\u2019t want an election until Johnson has asked for the Brexit extension. Their calculation is that Johnson will be weakened by doing so because he has made delivering Brexit on 31 October \u201ccome what may\u201d the totem of his prime ministership. They can therefore go to the country portraying him as someone who has failed to deliver his promises.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/25/what-happens-next-in-parliament-after-supreme-court-ruling\">What happens next in parliament after supreme court ruling?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d8aeb5b8f08fbb0c171af03\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kate-lyons\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-25T04:59:24.852Z\">5.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning and welcome to the politics live blog.</p> \n  <p>Yesterday was a fairly extraordinary day on both sides of the Atlantic.

      "bodyText": "I will wrap this blog up now. The first Commons session since parliament was prorogued by prime minister Boris Johnson with the intention to keep it suspended for 5 weeks on September 9 was as intense as anticipated. Furious MPs confronted the PM, after the Supreme Court had found that the suspension had been \u201cunlawful\u201d. Boris Johnson and Jacob-Rees Mogg told MPs repeatedly that they believe the Supreme Court verdict to be \u201cwrong\u201d. Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn called for the PM\u2019s resignation and Plaid Cymru for his impeachment. The PM mocked the opposition for voting against a general election and No 10 Downing Street challenged them to table a motion of no confidence tonight or \u201cshut up\u201d. Tory MPs reacted with standing ovations to the PM\u2019s attack on the opposition front bench - which is, strictly speaking, forbidden in the Commons. Widespread condemnation erupted after Boris Johnson shrugged off emotional comments by an MP about the murder of remain-campaigner and Labour MP Jo Cox with the word \u201chumbug\u201d; shortly after, the PM said Cox was best remembered by getting Brexit done, which further fuelled the outrage. Various MPs and pundits clamoured for the elimination of inflammatory language in parliament, and pointed out examples where such language has incited violence and endangered MPS and their families. The shadow Brexit secretary Matthew Pennycook has resigned, citing his wish to campaign full time for remain in a second referendum and the imminent birth of his second child as factors. Jacob Rees-Mogg said he would be making an \u201cexciting announcement\u201d in the Commons tomorrow. That\u2019s everything from me, goodnight. This from the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges: And this from Tory MP Tobias Ellwood: The sentiment that the increasingly irresponsible use of hazardous language is endangering MPs, judges and democracy itself has pervaded the evening and is even being uttered by Tory MPs now, here by cabinet minister Nicky Morgan: Here my colleagues Heather Stewart and Kate Proctor with a summary of tonight\u2019s Commons debate. Boris Johnson addresses MPs after supreme court ruling and clashes with Corbyn \u2013 video What a night it\u2019s been. Dominic Grieve told Peston he found the PM \u201cterrifying\u201d tonight, who received standing ovations from Conservative MPs for what Grieve describes as \u201ctotal populism\u201d. Here a reaction from the former Labour leader Ed Miliband: The Commons session has now been adjourned. Boris Johnson has given ITV\u2019s Peston a pre-recorded interview, which has aired at 10:45pm. Here some excerpts from the transcript: Boris Johnson: \u201c60 days ago, nobody said that we could change the withdrawal agreement in the EU Treaty\u201d Robert Peston: \u201cBut you haven\u2019t changed it\u201d BJ: \u201cNobody said everybody \u2013 on the contrary\u2026Everybody around the EU. Now accepts that it must be changed\u201d RB: \u201cBut it may be changed. It hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d BJ: \u201cNobody said that we could change the, uh, the backstop that is,\u201d RP: \u201cBut has it been done?\u201d BJ: \u201cThat is now under serious negotiation.\u201d RP: \u201ct\u2019s under discussion but when I talk to people in European capitals. They are very sceptical. You\u2019ll get anything like what you want.\u201d BJ: \u201cWell, it is certainly true, Robert, that uh, the British negotiating position has been undermined by the so-called surrender bill. Well not \u2018so called\u2019 It is a surrender bill. Uh, the, the, the bill that says that we\u2019d have to rule out no deal. They\u2019ve tried to wreck our negotiating position, but we\u2019re not going to let them do it, We\u2019re going to get on and negotiate a deal if we possibly can. And if we can\u2019t get up to you, then we\u2019re going to come out of the EU on October the 31st come what may.\u201d RP: \u201cBut you did say something that I thought was very interesting to MPs, which is, that you believe now that EU are agreeing to some mechanism. You\u2019ve got it, the principle of consent whereby whatever arrangements, if any arrangements to replace the backstop are agreed, they will be a way for Northern Ireland to get out of those arrangements. How would that work?\u201d BJ: \u201cWell, I mean, this is, this is kind of where the rubber is hitting the road. Okay. The, the, the, the, the problem with the backstop is, is it, it\u2019s the, it\u2019s the arrangement, right? Exactly. It\u2019s the arrangement that keeps the UK locked in the, uh, EU\u2019s legal order, the customs union and the single market with the EU having the say about our ability to exit. That\u2019s the problem with it. And it\u2019s just never going to go through the House of Commons. So we need to get rid of that. RP: \u201cBut do you get any sense, you were saying to some MPs that you think the EU will move on that. Genuinely?\u201d BJ: \u201cYes, I do. And they already genuinely have moved in the sense that they\u2019re willing to consider other ways that allow us to work with our Irish friends to accomplish several things. Number one, we need to avoid any kind of border checks.\u201d [...] RP: \u201c...the attorney general said today that you would abide by the so called Benn act, which says if you can\u2019t get a deal, you\u2019ve got to write to the EU requesting an extension. So you\u2019re going to write this letter, are you? BJ: \u201cWell we\u2019re going to go for a deal\u201d RP: \u201cNo! No! He said you would abide by this law, that means you would have to write the letter if there is no deal?\u201d BJ: \u201cThat of course only kicks in. If we fail to get a deal\u201d RP: \u201cBut you\u2019re conceding there\u2019s a reasonable prospect you\u2019re not going to get a deal.\u201d BJ: \u201cAnd under these circumstances, what I can say to you is that we will respect the law and we will come out on October the 31st\u201d RP: \u201cBut those two statements, many would say are completely incompatible\u201d BJ: \u201cWell we will respect the law and we will come out on October 31st\u201d RP: \u201cHow?\u201d BJ: \u201cWell. Obviously we\u2019ve got some, some tough negotiations ahead and if you\u2019ll forgive me, I don\u2019t want to tip the hand of the UK government more than parliament is already required us to do so RP: \u201cThe only reason I have the pleasure of seeing you here today is because you had to come back [inaudible]\u201d BJ: \u201cNo I was coming back anyway\u201d RP: [inaudible] many hours earlier than you would have expected. BJ: \u201cI fulfilled my commitments in New York.\u201d Rees-Mogg just promised \u201can exciting announcement\u201d for tomorrow, and paraphrased the PM\u2019s infamous \u201cwhat\u2019s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander\u201d line - which originally referred to equal treatment of the Tory MPs who might vote down a new deal and the Tory rebels who lost their whip for defying the government a few weeks ago. And here an interesting comment from Tim Bale, politics professor at Queen Mary, University of London: While a somewhat deflated debate rumbles on about the PM\u2019s conduct tonight and around the prorogation, I\u2019m turning my attention briefly to this from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby: Rees-Mogg now responds to a question by the shadow leader of the house Valerie Vaz, who quoted Rees-Mogg\u2019s alleged remark about the Supreme Court ruling representing a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d. Rees-Mogg says this quote was attributed to him after a cabinet meeting, and that cabinet meetings are meant to be confidential, to much laughter. He says it\u2019s a reasonable thing to disagree with somebody while also respecting them, like it is the case with himself and Bercow, and repeats the PM\u2019s stance that he believes the judgment was \u201cwrong\u201d. This is what\u2019s on tomorrow\u2019s Common\u2019s agenda: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Leader of the House, is now making his business statement. He opens by picking up the topic of the evening: Language that can have dire consequences for members of the house and their families. Says while he personally has only been subjected to \u201cminor\u201d affronts, incidents relating to other members have been more severe. A short while ago, Jeremy Cobyn called on the Speaker to get the leaders of all parties to issue a joint declaration \u201copposing any form of abusive language or threats\u201d. Rees-Mogg then congratulates Bercow for sitting in his chair for more than 10 hours. Amidst the turmoil in parliament tonight, the Brexit shadow secretary, Matthew Pennycook MP, has resigned, citing his desire to focus his efforts on campaigning \u201cunequivocally\u201d for remain in a second referendum and the imminent arrival of his second child. Anna Soubry is now speaking, again making the point that the use of inflammatory language in politics is vitally important to reflect on. She words such as \u201ctraitor\u201d, \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201ctreason\u201d are dangerous if deployed by politicians, and that the fact that MPs and their families are getting death threats because of such language could have grave consequences for parliamentary democracy. Boris Johnson has now left the chambers, which has caused some opposition MPs to complain to the Speaker. Bercow asked Johnson to stay and \u201csit down\u201d on his way out, and told him it would be \u201ccourteous\u201d, for him to stay, but then says he has been in the Commons for many hours and answered many, at times repetitive, questions, and that he does not think that the PM\u2019s departure represents a breech of the stipulations set out by the Supreme Court ruling. This from Brendan Cox, Jo Cox\u2019 widower, on the PM\u2019s remarks about his late wife tonight: Boris Johnson is now answering questions from a half empty chambers, more than 3 hours after he first appeared at the despatch box to address the Commons. Speaker John Bercow seems not bothered. \u201cThe hour is still quite early,\u201d he just told MPs. Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse made Johnson a rather extraordinary offer in the Commons. She said she will vote for his new deal, with the proviso that he promises to let the people make the ultimate decision in a second referendum. This, she said, would \u201cguarantee him\u201d a majority. Johnson\u2019s response is that this remark shows the Lib Dems can\u2019t be trusted, as party leader Jo Swinson pledged to revoke article 50 and scrap Brexit altogether. Here a video of Paula Sherriff\u2019s emotional speech about her friend Jo Cox, the Labour MP who was fatally shot and stabbed in June 2016 by a far-right extremist in the run up to the Brexit referendum. Cox was a passionate remain campaigner. Johnson\u2019s response of \u201cHumbug\u201d to Sherriff\u2019s speech is also being condemned. This from Channel 4\u2019s Ciaran Jenkins: And this from the Spectator\u2019s Isabel Hardman: Outrage about the PM\u2019s earlier suggestion that the best way to honour the murdered MP Jo Cox is to get Brexit done is widespread and growing. Here Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon: The Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson: And this from Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips: Just a little reminder that it\u2019s worth refreshing the blog every once in a while, as sometimes posts are added to or changed. And here a true nugget of gold, courtesy of Boris Johnson, here reported by the Independent\u2019s John Rentoul: Boris Johnson just said, when pressed on whether he\u2019ll go for a second prorogation, that the government will look closely at the provisions in the Supreme Court judgment to find a way forward. If you thought parliament gave Theresa May a tough time, tune in and watch the sheer rage Boris Johnson is at the receiving end of tonight. This from Labour MP Bridget Phillipson: This from Labour\u2019s Angela Rayner: This from Green MP Caroline Lucas: And this from my colleague Marina Hyde on tonight\u2019s backlash against the PM\u2019s tone: Johnson just said in the Commons that the best way of honouring the memory of Jo Cox and of bringing this country together is to get Brexit done. The atmosphere is still very charged, with a number of emotional speeches and pleas from MPs having taken place in the last half hour, with many addressing the distasteful tone in which much of the debate is being delivered. At some point, Johnson sounded like a father telling his distressed children that all will be well in the end, in a low, soft voice after many minutes of shouting and booing. This is the statement Lammy is referring to in the post below, here reported by the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley: This from Labour MP David Lammy, on Downing Street\u2019s announcement a little while ago that a second prorogation could be on the cards if the opposition does not table a no confidence vote tonight: And this from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg on the scenes that have played out in the Commons over the last hour or so. This is a point well worth noting, in the words of SkyNews\u2019 Lewis Goodall: Labour MP Paula Sherriff just had a withering, tearful outburst in the Commons, saying Johnson should be \u201cashamed\u201d of his conduct and that MPs had been threatened and put in danger, and should enjoy more respect from the prime minister. Sherriff reminded MPs of her friend Jo Cox\u2019s fate, who was murdered by an extremist for standing publicly by her beliefs. The PM rebuffed her remarks with blunt indifference. This from the HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh: Justine Greening, who had the Conservative whip removed on 3 September and now sits as an independent politician, is now asking the PM whether, if he brings a deal back to the Commons and, if it is rejected, he will respect it. She asks also whether he will respect the Benn bill and ask for an extension. She adds that it is \u201cdeeply disrespectful\u201d of the PM to continue to call the Benn bill \u201csurrender bill\u201d. Johnson responds by saying the \u201csurrender act\u201d has done great damage to what the government is trying to do, a clear and direct provocation. Adds that there will not be another extension. The mood dips after this, with an almost eerie momentary silence falling over the Commons. Asked by Conservative MP Victoria Prentis whether he is working hard for a Brexit deal and whether MPs will have the opportunity to vote on another deal, Johnson responds: \u201cI can absolutely guarantee that if and when we are able to bring back an agreement that I think will work for this house and this country on October 17 and 18, of course we will put it to parliament and I do hope it will then get assent.\u201d Following the PM\u2019s statement, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts MP, has called on the prime minister to be impeached for misleading the public about his attempted shut down of parliament. Roberts reminded Johnson that he had supported current Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price\u2019s motion seeking to impeach Tony Blair in 2004 for lying about the Iraq war. The process of impeachment would involve the House of Commons first voting on an impeachment motion, which, if passed, could lead to prosecution and trial. Historically trials have taken place in Westminster Hall, on the parliamentary estate. Saville Roberts asked the PM: The prime minister is surely not a man who would like to look inconsistent. So, I ask him: does he still believe it to be right and proper to seek to impeach a prime minister who has been judged to mislead the public? Anna Soubry, the leader of the Independent Group for Change, calls on Johnson to apologise to parliament and to the Queen. The PM responds by bringing up John\u2019s Major\u2019s previous proroguing of parliament for 18 days, and adds that parliament still has enough time to debate Brexit and always had enough time. Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips says the biggest difference between her and the PM is that she\u2019d be ashamed if the Labour party was responsible for the current mess. She joins the chorus of MPs calling on Johnson to show remorse, apologise, and be honest. This from the Labour MP Toby Perkins: Yvette Cooper was next up, and brought up the incongruence between the attorney general\u2019s concession from earlier that the government \u201cgot it wrong\u201d in relation to prorogation of parliament, and the PM\u2019s statement in the Commons a little while ago, in which he told MPs that the supreme court judgment was wrong. Johnson responded by restating that the judgment \u201cwas wrong\u201d. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, weighed in shortly after, and reminded the PM that \u201cactions have consequences\u201d. \u201cEven my five-year-old knows that if you do something wrong you have to say sorry,\u201d she said. Added that if her son can apologise for kicking a football indoors, the prime minster can have the humility to say sorry for \u201cmisleading the Queen and illegally shutting down\u201d democracy. Jeremy Hunt told Boris Johnson that he\u2019s glad he\u2019s not PM. He said that a large proportion of people are being \u201calienated\u201d by attempts to block Brexit. Hello everyone, I\u2019m taking over from my colleague Andrew Sparrow now. Ian Blackford, parliamentary leader of the SNP, is not beating around the bush tonight. \u201cHas he no shame?\u201d he asked about Boris Johnson in his speech in the Commons a little while ago. Blackford said Johnson accuses MPs of running off to the courts, but has no reasonable justification for his actions, and called it \u201cdevastating\u201d for a PM to have such judgment. That\u2019s not leadership, he said. He added that Johnson\u2019s language was \u201cdespicable\u201d and unsuitable for a PM, and that he is no longer tenable. He said the PM sought to silence parliament and fought the law, but the law won. \u201cThe opposition must unite to trigger a vote of no confidence to bring this chaotic government down,\u201d Blackford said. He reiterated that the SNP\u2019s priority is stopping no deal, and that doing nothing is no option anymore. The PM\u2019s \u201ctime must be up\u201d, he said. The Speaker, John Bercow, reminded Blackford that he must not call on the prime minister to \u201cend his lying\u201d. Blackford conceded. Earlier, when Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, was under pressure during questions, he retaliated with a blistering, offensive broadside about parliament, dismissing it as \u201cdead\u201d and having \u201cno moral right to sit\u201d. (See 12.21pm.) MPs have a perfect right to sit because they were elected, just two years ago, but no matter. A few hours later Boris Johnson chose exactly the same hyper-aggressive approach. Having been found to have acted unlawfully by the supreme court, some humility might have been expected. But instead Johnson sounded utterly unrepentant, and instead his speech amounted highly-charged, after-dinner rant about Labour and the rest of the opposition, whom he accused of blocking Brexit. Tory MPs loved it. And if the Number 10 strategy at the moment is all about depicting Johnson as a tribune of the Brexit-loving masses, taking on the courts and parliament, perhaps at one point, when the election comes, it will work. But what was striking was that this appears to be about the only strategy Johnson has. Today Johnson had absolutely nothing to say about his Brexit negotiating strategy and he had absolutely nothing to say about his strategy for getting legislation through parliament. Jeremy Corbyn said the speech amounted to \u201c10 minutes of bluster\u201d, and he was right. All the alpha-male belligerent bravado was cover for the fact that the PM seems to be running out of options. Here are the main points. Johnson challenged the opposition parties to call a vote of no confidence if they want a general election. He said he would make time for a motion tabled by a minor opposition party, not just Labour, to be debated. But the opposition parties want a guarantee that there will not be a no-deal Brexit on 31 October first, and so it is hard to see this offer being taken up. Johnson accused the opposition of being afraid of facing the public. This was undemocratic, he claimed. He said: It\u2019s not just that this parliament is in gridlock, paralysed and refusing to deliver the priorities of the people. It\u2019s not just unable to move forward. It\u2019s worse than that \u2013 out of sheer selfishness and political cowardice members opposite are unwilling to move aside and give the people a say. He said he wanted to offer voters a \u201clife after Brexit\u201d. He said: The public don\u2019t want another referendum \u2013 what they want and what they demand, is that we honour the promise we made to the voters to respect the first referendum. And they also want us to move on \u2013 to put Brexit behind us and focus on the NHS, on violent crime and on cutting the cost of living. That is why I also brought forward a Queen\u2019s speech. My government intends to present a programme for life after Brexit. He said that he thought the supreme court decision was wrong. Corbyn renewed his call for Johnson should resign. He opened his statement saying: I thank the prime minister for advance copy of his statement. Unfortunately it was like his illegal prorogation of parliament: null, of no effect, and should be quashed. This was 10 minutes of bluster from a dangerous prime minister who thinks he is above the law, but in truth is not fit for the office he holds. Corbyn said Labour would be happy to back an election as soon as Johnson agreed to extend article 50. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Jedidajah Otte is taking over now. Johnson is replying to Corbyn. He says he does respect the supreme court. On the subject of the Benn Act, he says he will respect the law and come out of the EU on 31 October. He says preparations for a no-deal Brexit are going well. He says there is progress in the Brexit talks. But he says it has not been made any easier by the opposition, and the \u201csurrender bill\u201d (his term for the Benn Act). He says he is sorry the Labour conference is over. He says he would have liked people to have heard more of Labour policies like abolishing private schools. Johnson says he has heard that Corbyn wanted to announce an election in his conference speech. But he was censored by the \u201cStasi\u201d in Labour, in the form of John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, he says. He says Corbyn is being held hostage by his party. \u201cFree the Islington One,\u201d he says. He says: \u201cThis parliament must either stand aside and either let this government get Brexit done or bring a vote of confidence and finally face a day of reckoning with the voters.\u201d As he ends he gets a prolonged round of applause from Conservative MPs. This is unusual. MPs are not supposed to applaud, and when MPs do break the rules, it is more often SNP and Labour MPs who clap than Tories. Corbyn says, for the good of the country, Johnson should go. He says he wants an election. And Johnson wants an election. Corbyn ends: If he wants an election, get an extension and let\u2019s have an election. Corbyn says Johnson also has questions to ask about his conduct in public office. He says the culture department is reviewing the awarding of a grant to a company run by his friend. Did Johnson initiate that review? Will he report himself to the Cabinet Office for investigation. Here is the Guardian\u2019s latest story on this, from my colleagues Rajeev Syal and Matthew Weaver. Corbyn says the Operation Yellowhammer document shows why a no-deal Brexit would be so serious. Why did the government describe these documents when they were leaked as out-of-date? When it was published, it was exactly the same? Corbyn says it talks of people going of without food and medicine. He says Johnson has hardly put any progress into the Brexit talks. Any progress has been minimal. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said there had been very little support. Corbyn says he has some questions for Johnson. Does Johnson think the government got it wrong, or does he agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg that the supreme court committed a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d. Can Johnson confirm that he will abide by the terms of the Benn Act? Jeremy Corbyn is responding to Johnson now. He says Johnson\u2019s statement was similar to what the supreme court said about prorogation - \u201cnull, of no effect, and should be quashed\u201d. He says this is an extraordinary and precarious moment in this country\u2019s history. The highest court in the land found that the PM broke the law, he says. He says the judges concluded there was no reason, let alone a good reason, for the PM to have shut down parliament. He says Johnson should have done the right thing and resigned afterwards. But instead he is here, with no shred of humility and no substance either. Johnson says Labour has until the house rises today to table a motion of no confidence. If it does that, it can have the vote tomorrow. And he uses the line flagged up earlier about being willing to make the time for a confidence vote if the other opposition parties want to table a no confidence motion. Johnson ends by saying it is time to get Brexit done. He wants to deal with the people\u2019s priorities, like the NHS. He says parliament decided to hold this referendum. It should either get this done or face the voters. Johnson says the opposition parties had a remedy at their disposal. He says the opposition parties could have voted for an election. In Brighton Labour members demanded one - even though they twice voted against it. He says Jeremy Corbyn keeps changing his mind. He does not know whether John McDonnell has forced him to change his mind. He asks if Corbyn will vote no confidence in Johnson as PM. He asks if Corbyn even wants to be PM. He says Corbyn wants him to go to Brussels on 17 October to negotiate a delay. But Corbyn won\u2019t go himself. And even if he did want to go, his colleagues would not let him, because they don\u2019t want him negotiating for Britain with people like Vladimir Putin. Johnson says some MPs have been going to the courts to block Brexit. He says it is no disrespect to say that while he respects the supreme court, he thinks its decision was wrong. He says decisions about prorogation are political matters. He says the Labour party is determined to say it knows best, and to thumb its noses at the people. Jeremy Corbyn and his party do not trust the people, he says. He says they do not care about the extra cost of staying in. And they do not care about Brexit being delayed for months, he says. He says he wants to move up a gear. But Labour wants to put on the handbrake. He says he will not betray the people. Johnson says he wants to show the public there is \u201clife after Brexit\u201d. That is why he wants a Queen\u2019s speech, so he can show his domestic programme. Johnson says the opposition parties are promising a second referendum. But the idea that there could be a second referendum, with people respecting the result, is a fantasy, he says. He says the public do not want a second referendum. They want the first one honoured, he says. Boris Johnson is making his statement now. He says the British people just want Brexit done. He says he has been making progress in the Brexit talks with the EU. In his speech to the Labour conference yesterday Jeremy Corbyn accused Boris Johnson of planning to send troops to Saudia Arabia. He told delegates: It really beggars belief that this week Boris Johnson is openly talking about sending troops to Saudi Arabia as part of the increasingly dangerous confrontation between Saudi Arabia and Iran, in an apparent bid to appease Donald Trump. Have we learned nothing? In the Commons a few minutes ago, in a statement on Iran, Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, repeated the same point, saying that Johnson was \u201copenly talking about sending troops to Saudia Arabia in an apparent bid to please Donald Trump\u201d. She asked for an assurance that, if troops were going to be sent to the Gulf for military action, that the Commons would get a vote. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, claimed that there were no such plans. Responding to Thornberry, he said: [Thornberry] talked whether the UK would be sending troops to Saudia Arabia. There has been no suggestion of that at all. It is simply wrong for her to say it. What has been said is that the US is sending troops to Saudi Arabia to make sure that Saudi can protect itself from further attacks, or repeats of the attacks Aramco. We have said that we would consider a request that we\u2019ve received for support in relation to air defences. That is something that we will consider. But we are absolutely clear that our over-arching strategic objective is deescalation, reducing tensions. And we want to see Iran come in from out of the international cold. But we need to be absolutely unwavering and clear in our resolve that the only way that will happen is if Iran steps up and starts to meet its responsibilities. The suggestion that the UK was considering sending troops to Saudia Arabia, emerged from what Boris Johnson said when he spoke to reporters on his flight to New York recently, although the headlines about troops being despatched (see here and here) did not necessarily match what was actually being proposed. According to a leak of what Boris Johnson is due to say in his statement to MPs shortly, he will challenge the opposition parties to table a motion of no confidence in the government. This is from the Press &amp; Journal\u2019s Dan O\u2019Donoghue. Under current parliamentary rules only a motion of no confidence tabled by the leader of the opposition has to be debated. Jeremy Corbyn says he will only do that when he is sure he can win, and when he has absolutely guaranteed that there will not be a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Johnson seems to be planning to say that, if the Lib Dems or the SNP tabled a no confidence motion, he would make time for it to be debated. But all the opposition parties are agreed at the moment that they want an absolute guarantee that there will not be a no-deal Brexit first. My colleague Heather Stewart has more on the plans for a vote tomorrow on a mini-recess to allow Tory MPs to attend their party conference in Manchester. From the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley John Bercow, the Speaker, has just confirmed that he wants Boris Johnson\u2019s statement to MPs to start at 6.30pm. This is from Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti. He says Labour MPs have been told to expect a vote on a conference recess tomorrow. The Tories want to go ahead with a recess so that they can hold their party conference in Manchester. Jeremy Corbyn said this morning that Labour was not in favour of agreeing a recess motion, although Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, suggested the party might offer some flexibility. See 9.46am. According to the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard, Labour suggested that one compromise might be for the Commons to sit next week, but with no contentious legislation scheduled for early in the week. The government does not seem to have accepted the offer. My colleague Gwyn Topham has a wonderful story on the Grant Shapps Thomas Cook statement earlier. This is how it starts. If there was a previous transport secretary that the incumbent, Grant Shapps, might hope not to imitate, it would surely be his notoriously calamity-stricken predecessor Chris Grayling. But just a few months after his return to cabinet after several years out in the cold, Shapps appears to have followed Grayling\u2019s example rather too closely \u2013 lifting sections of his speech to the House of Commons on the collapse of Thomas Cook from Grayling\u2019s equivalent statement when Monarch Airlines went bust in 2017. At the beginning of his statement, Shapps appears to have followed Grayling\u2019s text almost to the letter, simply substituting Thomas Cook for Monarch and adjusting numbers. \u201cWith your permission, I would like to make a statement about the steps the government have been taking to support those affected by the collapse of Monarch Airlines, Thomas Cook, in particular the 110,000 150,000 passengers left abroad without a flight back to the UK and the almost 2,000 9,000 people who have lost their jobs.\u201d And here is the full story. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar In the Commons Labour\u2019s Justin Madders asks Gove if he has any plans to use the Civil Contingencies Act in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Gove says he has no plans to use it. His statement is now over. John Bercow, the Speaker, says 87 backbenchers were able to ask questions. The Gove statement is still going on \u2013 although the length of the statement is in inverse proportion to the quantity of information being revealed. Gove is doing a very professional job of sidestepping the awkward questions. We have got a statement on Iran from the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, to come next. All this means that it will probably be 6.30pm at the earliest before Boris Johnson starts his statement. In response to a question from the independent MP John Woodcock, Gove says it is impossible to tell if the food bill for an average low-income family will go up or down after Brexit. Antoinette Sandbach, the former Tory now sitting as an independent, asks Gove if the government will now publish all version of the Operation Yellowhammer documents, as it is supposed to under the terms of the \u201chumble address\u201d motion. Gove does not give that commitment. He just says the government is publishing a lot of detail about its no-deal planning. Responding to a private notice question in the Lords on the extension of article 50, Lord Callanan, minister of state for exiting the European Union, repeated again and again that the government would always \u201cabide by the law\u201d, but refused to be drawn on whether they would seek to find a loophole in the Benn Act. He was asked repeatedly about quotes from a Number 10 spokesperson that the government could send a second letter \u2013 along with the letter requesting an extension as mandated in the Benn Act \u2013 which sought to dissuade the EU from granting a delay. \u201cThe government will of course abide by the law,\u201d he said, in response to a question by Labour\u2019s Lady Hayter of Kentish Town. Lord Cormack, a Conservative, followed up: \u201cCan I ask my noble friend to confirm that in the unhappy event, and for me it would be an unhappy event, that no deal is reached by 31 October, that the prime minister will abide by the law that parliament has passed?\u201d \u201cI am happy to confirm to the noble Lord the answer that I gave earlier: the government will abide by the law,\u201d said Callanan. Labour\u2019s Lord Harris of Haringey said Callanan hadn\u2019t answered the question. He went on: We of course assume that the government will abide by the law. But the question was about [whether] a second letter would be sent saying to the EU \u2018please don\u2019t accept our request\u2019. Can he give a categorical assurance that the government will not do that and will not seek to go around the wording of the law which was passed by this house. Callanan replied: I can give the noble lord a categorical assurance that the government will abide by the law. We write all sorts of letters to all sorts of people, all of the time. I\u2019m sure letter-writing will continue even in no deal. And I can go no further that to repeat what I\u2019ve said which is of course we are a law-abiding government. Earlier Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, told the Commons that the automative industry was ready for a no-deal Brexit. As the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam points out that, that is not what the industry\u2019s trade body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said this week. Labour\u2019s Owen Smith asks Gove if he can assure police officers in Northern Ireland will not be asked to patrol the Irish border, putting their lives at risk. Gove says the government has \u201cabsolutely no intention\u201d of putting infrastructure at or near the border that might have to be policed. Dominic Grieve, the former Tory attorney general, asks when the phrase \u201cbase case\u201d in the Operation Yellowhammer document was changed to \u201cworst case\u201d. And he says, as chair of the intelligence and security committee, he wants to know what the mitigations are that will replace having access to the Schengen database. Gove explains the difference between base case (agreed outcomes) and worst case, but he does not say when the wording was changed. And he refuses to say what the alternatives to the Schengen database will be. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, says even if Border Force officers get new powers, they will not have the information they need to check people in the event of a no-deal Brexit. She asks Gove why he is claiming the UK would be safer. Gove says she has questioned people involved in national security and the Border Force. \u201cAppropriate mitigations are in place,\u201d he says, and new powers are available. Sir David Lidington, the former Cabinet Office minister, asks what will happen in Northern Ireland if there is a no-deal Brexit. How will the civil service be able to manage if there is no functioning executive. Gove says if there is still no power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland, the government would have to consider giving new powers to Northern Ireland civil service. That is because, under no deal, the civil servants running Northern Ireland would need to take decisions (in relation to matters like customs) going beyond the powers they currently have. Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, asks how Britain will be safer than before when the police will not have access to EU crime and justice databases in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Because Border Force staff will have new powers, says Gove. Damian Green, the former first secretary of state, asks if hauliers have done what is necessary to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. Green represents Ashford in Kent. Gove says the government is contacting hauliers. But further steps need to be taken. Gove is responding to Starmer. He starts by welcoming Starmer back from Brighton, saying one thing about the House of Commons is that at least they record votes properly. That\u2019s a reference to Labour deciding its new Brexit policy on a show of hands, despite calls for a card vote. Gove repeats his point about the withdrawal agreement now being \u201cin play\u201d in the negotiations. And he says business is preparing for Brexit. But Gove spends most of his time criticising Labour, and he ends by saying Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Brexit policy is \u201cas solid as a blancmange in a hurricane\u201d. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is responding to Gove now. He asks Gove to confirm that the four papers submitted to the EU about alternatives to the backstop are \u201cnon-papers\u201d. And is it right they have not been shared with the EU27? Starmer says he does not accept that businesses are well prepared. He sat with business leaders last week, and their main concern was about how ill-prepared businesses were. He asks about the Commons vote earlier this month requiring the publication of all the Operation Yellowhammer documents. He says the government just published a short document (pdf). Nothing else has been disclosed. Gove claimed it was a document from the last government. But it was dated 2 August, when Boris Johnson was PM, Starmer says Gove claimed on the Marr Show was that this was an old document, and the worst-case scenario. Gove also claimed it was being updated, Starmer says. He asks Gove to explain why, when it was leaked to the Sunday Times, it said it was a base case scenario. But when it was published it was described as worst-case scenario. Referring to Gove\u2019s comment on LBC this morning about Boris Johnson being a \u201cborn winner\u201d (see 11am), Starmer says he is glad that Gove has not lost his sense of humour. He says to leave the country unprepared for a no-deal Brexit is unforgivable. In the Commons Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal Brexit planning, is making a statement now. He says there has been \u201csignificant movement in recent weeks\u201d in the the Brexit talks with the EU. Until recently the withdrawal agreement was sacrosanct. But now they have acknowledged that it can be changed. And up until this point, the European Union have also said that the backstop was inviolable but again European leaders have said they are \u2018not emotionally attached to the backstop\u2019 and there are other ways, other ways, of ensuring that we can safeguard the gains of the Good Friday/Belfast agreement and also ensure that smooth trade flows across the island of Ireland. He says he wants to talk about no-deal plans. The cabinet XO (EU exit operations) has met 48 times, he says. He says under Operation Yellowhammer the government has prepared for worst-case scenarios. From my colleague Daniel Boffey From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth One theory is that the PM could resign, oblige the Queen to make Jeremy Corbyn prime minister, defeat the government on a no confidence motion and then wait for the election a few weeks later. But there are two obvious problems with this tactic. 1) As PM Corbyn would have the authority to request an extension to article 50. That means Boris Johnson would be leading the opposition Tory party into a general election having failed to deliver his key pledge \u2013 taking the UK out of the EU by 31 October. 2) Incumbent prime minister have considerable advantages in electoral politics. Even with a government majority, they can exercise power and patronage and spend government money. And for Johnson the danger would be that, after having Corbyn as PM for a few months, the public might decide they like him a lot more. David Gauke, the former Tory justice secretary who had the whip withdrawn earlier this month after rebelling over Brexit, has called for Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief of staff, to be sacked. Cummings is blamed for Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to adopt a highly confrontational approach to parliament, including proroguing parliament for five weeks. \u201cI think the prime minister needs a different strategy and a different strategist,\u201d Gauke told the World at One. A plan is in place to restrict holiday leave for police officers in Northern Ireland following Brexit. As the Press Association reports, a total of 10% of officers will be able to take time off for the first six weeks after the United Kingdom is scheduled to leave the European Union on 31 October. Police Service of Northern Ireland assistant chief constable George Clarke described it in an interview with the PA news agency as a \u201csensible operational contingency\u201d, adding it would be kept under review. MPs returning to parliament on Wednesday are discussing plans to force Boris Johnson to request a Brexit extension earlier than the current 19 October deadline, to avoid no deal, my colleague Kate Proctor reports. In the Commons Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, is making a statement about Thomas Cook. He said that bailing out the company would have involved \u201cthrowing good money after bad\u201d, but he said the government would legislate to ensure that in future airlines can be wound down in a more orderly way. He told MPs: [Firms] need to be able to look after their customers and we need to be able to ensure their planes can keep flying in order that we don\u2019t have to set up a shadow airline. This is where we will focus our efforts in the next couple of weeks. We will require primary legislation, and, dare I say it, a new session of parliament. While all eyes are on the newly reconvened Commons, the Labour party\u2019s autumn conference is still under way. Members this morning voted overwhelmingly to give full voting rights to all UK residents, urging the party to extend the franchise to millions of migrants. As well as extending voting rights, the motion tabled by the Labour for Free Movement campaign calls on a future Labour government to close all immigration detention centres, ending \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d policies, and to seeking to extend free movement rights. The motion also opposed immigration systems based on a person\u2019s income or \u201cutility to big business\u201d and any caps or targets on the numbers of people moving to the UK. The fact that a motion passes at the Labour party\u2019s conference does not necessarily mean it will end up in a future general election manifesto, though it contributes to the policy-making process. Only British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens are able to vote in general elections, while citizens of EU countries can vote in local elections and European elections. Extending the vote to the 3 million EU nationals living in the UK would have a significant impact on any second referendum on the UK\u2019s EU membership. Ana Oppenheim, from the Labour Campaign for Free Movement and the leftwing pro-EU group Another Europe is Possible, said it was \u201ca source of shame for many activists\u201d that the party\u2019s 2017 manifesto pledged to end free movement. She said: Now we can move forward not only committed to defending free movement, but to giving migrants the vote. If we win, the next election will be the last election in which people like me are shut out of the democratic process. Celebrating the success of the motion the Labour Campaign for Free Movement tweeted a photograph of the controversial \u201cControls on Immigration\u201d mug, which was produced by the Labour party during the 2015 general election campaign. \u201cNow officially in the bin,\u201d the tweet read. The motion said Labour should campaign for \u201cfree movement, equality and rights for migrants\u201d. It also said: Free movement, equality and rights for migrants, are socialist values and benefit us all. Confronted with attacks on migrants \u2013 from the racist \u2018hostile environment\u2019 to the Conservatives\u2019 immigration bill that plans to end free movement and strip the rights of working-class migrants \u2013 we stand for solidarity, equality and freedom. Scapegoating, ending free movement and attacking migrants\u2019 rights are attacks on all workers. They make migrant workers more precarious and vulnerable to hyperexploitation, pressing down wages and conditions for everyone. They divide us, making it harder to unionise and push back. At the 2017 election Labour\u2019s manifesto said freedom of movement within the EU would end when the UK ceased to be a member. After Brexit Labour wants a close relationship with the single market, but it has not formally committed to keeping the UK in the single market \u2013 a move that would ensure EU free movement continued. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, told MPs earlier that the government would comply with the Benn Act that is intended to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. (See 12.34pm.) But ITV\u2019s political editor Robert Peston has had a message from a government source implying that, although the PM would be willing to write a letter to the EU formally requesting an article 50 extension (in the event of there being no Brexit deal by 19 October), he would also send a second letter containing all sorts of arguments intended to ensure that the EU would say no. Peston himself is not one of those people inclined to use capital letters in his tweets, and so I\u2019m presuming that the angry, Trump-style capitalisation comes from an original message sent by his source. Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader and shadow culture secretary, is speaking now. He says it is hard to see how the grant to Hacker House was justified. It was awarded under a scheme intended to develop cyber-skills in the UK. But this company is headquartered in California, and its owner lives in the US, he says. And it refuses to say how many employees it has in the UK, or where they work. Then he turns to Boris Johnson. Watson goes on: The truth is our prime minister does reckless things. He is a man whose character rends him unfit for the office he holds. Warman repeats his point about Johnson not being involved in the decision to award the grant to Hacker House. He criticises Watson for raising issues irrelevant to this issue. In the Commons Matt Warman, the culture minister, is answering an urgent question about the \u00a3100,000 grant to Hacker House - a company run by Jennifer Arcuri, a close friend of Boris Johnson\u2019s. He confirms that Hacker House has had a grant. He says the culture department is reviewing whether this grant was properly awarded. The Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, who tabled the UQ, says she is not interested in Johnson\u2019s personal life. But she is interested in ensuring that the rules are followed. She says these grants are supposed to go to UK companies, but that this firm does not seem to be genuinely based in the UK. And she asks if Johnson was involved in the award of the grant. Warman says Johnson and his staff were not involved in the decision to award this grant. He says Hacker House is registered with Companies House as being based in the UK. He says he is happy to answer questions about whether this grant was properly awarded. But he says Moran should not be using this issue to \u201cspread tittle-tattle\u201d. Cox has just finished. At this rate, Boris Johnson is unlikely to be starting his statement before 5pm. Cox has just said that the government will bring forward another motion calling for a general election \u201cshortly\u201d. It tried twice earlier in the month, but on both occasions failed to get get the support of two-thirds of MPs, as required under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act for an early election to happen. Phillip Lee, the former Tory MP who defected to the Lib Dems, told Cox he should be showing more humility. He asks him if he can say if he has given Downing Street legal advice on bypassing the Benn Act. Cox said that he was not allowed to say whether he had given legal advice on a topic or not. But he said Lee was not in a position to urge him to show more humility. Having been elected for one party, and now sitting for another without holding a byelection, Lee should be \u201con his knees\u201d begging for forgiveness from his constituents, Cox said. Amber Rudd, the former Tory work and pensions secretary who now sits as an independent having resigned over Brexit, tells Cox she objects to him calling this a \u201cdead\u201d parliament. She says it was only elected in 2017. She says, if it is divided, that is because it reflects the divisions in Britain. I must raise my concerns about the attorney general constantly saying that this parliament is dead. This parliament was elected in 2017, it reflects the divisions in this country, the divisions in our communities and the divisions in our families. The failure is that we have not yet reached a compromise, many of us long to leave the EU as we set out in the referendum but are frustrated by the fact that we have not been able to find a consensus amongst the different factions. Cox replies: If I had not been driven to this language, I would not have used it. But he was driven to use this language, he says. No one worked harder than he did to get a compromise deal through parliament, he says. He goes on: I have now reached a sad conclusion that this parliament is no longer worth sitting. It should be gone, for any good it is doing. Here is a full version of what Geoffrey Cox said about parliament being a \u201cdisgrace\u201d with \u201cno moral right to sit\u201d. He was responding to a question from Rory Stewart, the former international development secretary who lost the Tory whip after rebelling over Brexit. Cox said: I would agree with him that parliament has to determine the terms on which we leave, but this parliament has declined three times to pass a withdrawal act, with which the opposition \u2013 in relation to the withdrawal act \u2013 had absolutely no objection. Then we now have a wide number of this house setting its face against leaving at all. And when this government draws the only logical inference from that position, which is that it must leave therefore without any deal at all, it still sets its face, denying the electorate the chance of having its say in how this matter should be resolved. This parliament is a dead parliament. It should no longer sit. It has no moral right to sit on these green benches ... They don\u2019t like to hear it Mr Speaker. Twice they have been asked to let the electorate decide upon whether they should be allowed to sit in their seats, while they block 17.4 million people\u2019s vote. This parliament is a disgrace. Given the opportunity, since I am asked, let me tell them the truth: they could vote no confidence at any time, but they are too cowardly. They could agree to a motion to allow this house to dissolve but they are too cowardly. This parliament should have the courage to face the electorate. But it won\u2019t, because so many of them are really all about preventing us leaving the European Union at all. But the time is coming, the time is coming Mr Speaker, when even these turkeys won\u2019t be able to prevent Christmas. Cox has just told MPs that in future it might make sense for appointments to the supreme court to be approved by parliament. In response to a question about whether allowing MPs to confirm judicial appointments would be necessary if the courts became more political, he said MPs might have to \u201creflect\u201d on that. He said Brexit would mean \u201cwe are going to have to look again at our constitutional arrangements\u201d. As the UK left the EU, a \u201cgreat gap\u201d would open up in the law, he said. One matter may very well be whether there needs to be parliamentary scrutiny of judicial appointments in some manner. But Cox said that he personally would not be \u201centhusiastic\u201d about the idea. Jacob Rees Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, is expected to lay out government business this afternoon. He is expected to request a short break for Conservative Party conference - a proposal which Jeremy Corbyn said they could oppose. The Conservative party has indicated it will continue with conference, scheduled to take place in Manchester from Sunday to Wednesday next week, whatever is decided by Parliament. James Cleverly, the party\u2019s co-chairman, has Tweeted that it will go ahead. A debate could be held on any proposed break as early as Thursday. If the government loses that vote, it could give the Conservatives a real headache. Conference is a highly lucrative event for the party. If a break is not formally supported, it could force Tory ministers and MPs to return from conference events for votes. One option for the government would be to table non-controversial bills for next week, which would take up most of the day. However, they might still have to return for major votes. It has also emerged that the government\u2019s opponents in parliament could apply to the high court asking for a civil servant to go to Brussels if Boris Johnson has not brought back a deal by October 19th and refuses to request an article 50 extension. It is understood that an application would be made at the Royal Courts of Justice to direct a high ranking civil servant, possibly the cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill, to carry out parliament\u2019s duty. The Queen\u2019s speech, scheduled for October 14, is where the government will set out its agenda and forthcoming priorities. A vote is scheduled to take place five days later on October 21, where MPs will debate the measures put forward by the government. Nick Boles, the former Conservative who now sits as an independent, asked Cox if he could give MPs an assurance that the government would abide by the Benn Act in the event of the government not agreeing a Brexit deal. In those circumstances, the act says, the PM must request a three-month Brexit extension. Cox gave a clear answer: \u201cYes.\u201d Twice now Geoffrey Cox has challenged the opposition to agree to back an early general election by backing a one-line bill amending the Fixed-term Parliaments Act and allowing one. This mechanism could have been used in early September to hold a general election before 31 October. Although Labour said it wanted an early election, it argued that it could not risk this approach because it could not be sure that the PM would not change the date of the election, to hold it after 31 October. Cox seemed to be implying that the government would back a one-line bill that would specify a particular date for the election. But it is now too late. Under electoral law an election has to take place at least 25 working days after dissolution, and so even if parliament were to pass a law and dissolve today, it would be impossible to hold an election before 31 October. Attack is the best form of defence, they often say. And Geoffrey Cox, who has faced considerable criticism during this UQ, has just retaliated with remarkable attack on the opposition, and the authority of parliament. He said that parliament was \u201cdead\u201d and had \u201cno moral right to sit\u201d, but that the opposition were afraid of an election. This parliament is a dead parliament. It should no longer sit. It has no moral right to sit on these green benches. This generated an uproar from the opposition. But Cox went on, saying the opposition did not like to hear what he had to say. Twice MPs have been asked to approve a general election, he said. But they would not allow one, he went on. This parliament is a disgrace ... They could vote no confidence at any time. But they are too cowardly ... This parliament should have the courage to face the electorate. But it won\u2019t because so many of them are about preventing us leaving the European Union. But the time is coming when even these turkeys won\u2019t be able to prevent Christmas. Here is LBC\u2019s Theo Usherwood on Cox\u2019s answer to Letwin. (See 12.09am.) Sir Oliver Letwin, the former Tory Cabinet Office minister who lost the whip after rebelling over Brexit earlier this month, asks Cox for an assurance that there will be no further prorogation, other than a short one ahead of a possible Queen\u2019s speech, before the end of October. Cox says he can assure Letwin that the government will comply with the supreme court judgment. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle asks Cox how Jacob Rees-Mogg can stay as leader of the Commons if he has accused the supreme court of a constitutional coup. Cox says there is \u201cnothing wrong with expressing robust, critical views about a judgment\u201d. There is nothing wrong with expressing robust critical views about a judgment, in so far as it imputes inappropriate or improper motive then it is wrong. So, I think it\u2019s a question of wording and of being careful with ones language but I took that remark in so far as I saw it reported simply to be a robust criticism of the judgment and nothing more. Cox says it is acceptable to be critical of judgments. But it is not acceptable to attack the motives of judges, he says. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, asked Cox if he agreed that the supreme court ruling was a constitutional coup. (See 10.26am.) Cox implied that Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, did not really mean it when he used that phrase. Cox said: I don\u2019t think it was a constitutional coup ... I don\u2019t think anybody does ... These things can be said in the heat of rhetorical and poetic licence. In response to a question from Dominic Grieve, a former Tory who now sits as an independent, Cox says he would not have been able to support a decision to prorogue parliament until the end of October. If the PM had proposed that, Cox would have resigned, he suggests. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow solicitor general, says the supreme court judgment amounts to \u201cthe most damning judicial indictment of a government in modern times\u201d. He says the government \u201cstands shamed \u2013 tendering illegal advice to Her Majesty\u201d. He says the legal advice should be published in full. And he points out that, although Cox is saying he accepts the supreme court judgment, Michael Gove told the BBC this morning that the government still thought it had done nothing wrong. (See 8.09am.) He says the government has already been found in contempt of parliament. Now it has been found in contempt of law. Cox says there is nothing unusual about a lawyer having his opinion rejected by a court. He says courts in Scotland and in England backed his view. If people think Cox should resign, should the lord chief justice and the master of the rolls (who both said prorogation was lawful) resign too? He accuses Thomas-Symonds of a \u201cshameless piece of cynical opportunism\u201d. He says his advice was sound at the time. The supreme court took a different view, he says. He says it was entitled to do that. But it was making new law. The SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry told Cox she was not calling for his resignation \u2013 yet. But she asked him if he could confirm what Amber Rudd said \u2013 that cabinet ministers asked to see the prorogation legal advice, but that they were not shown it. In reply, Cox repeated the point he had made about considering what more might be published, but he did not address the point about ministers being denied access to it. Cox says the government does not publish the legal advice it gets. But he says he would consider over the coming days whether the public interest would be served by his disclosing more information about the advice given to the government in this case. Cox says he will consider publishing more information about the legal advice he gave the PM about prorogation. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, is responding to an urgent question from the SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry about his legal advice regarding prorogation. Yesterday Sky News ran a story about Cox advising the government that a five-week prorogation would be lawful. It led to Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, saying that Cox should consider his position. Cox says the government set out its view in a court document published on the supreme court\u2019s website. He says the government thought prorogation was legal. On the subject of resigning, he says: If every time I lost a case I was called upon to resign, I would probably have never had a practice. He says the government accepts the judgment from the supreme court. At all times the government acted in good faith and in the belief that its approach was both lawful and constitutional. John Bercow, the Speaker, is addressing MPs. He says the official record will be changed so that the reference to parliament being prorogued will be \u201cexpunged\u201d. Instead he says it will be recorded that parliament adjourned until today instead. He thanks the staff of the Commons for allowing it to meet today. He says there are no ministerial questions today, including no PMQs. That is because three days are normally allowed for MPs to table questions. The UK must table written proposals to solve the Irish border Brexit question within the next week, Leo Varadkar and Donald Tusk have said. The taoiseach revealed the details of his conversation with Tusk on Monday in New York in remarks after his meeting with Boris Johnson last night. He said: We have working methods and I know that President Tusk and other EU heads of government would like to see British proposals in writing really in the first week of October, otherwise it is very hard to see how we could agree something at the summit in the middle of October. He also signalled a significant shift on the EU\u2019s opposition to re-opening the withdrawal agreement by noting it could not be changed at the last minute because of its treaty status. The withdrawal agreement is actually an international treaty. It\u2019s not the kind of thing that can be amended or cobbled together late at night at the European council meeting on 17 October. So if the UK does have meaningful proposals, changes that they would like to suggest to the withdrawal agreement or to the joint political declaration more particularly, we really need to see them in advance so that they can be worked through and worked up in advance of the EU summit. A full write up is in the Irish Times. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, is speaking to the media outside Westminster now. She says the Lib Dems want parliament to bring forward a mechanism that would stop the government trying to bypass the Benn Act, which is designed to stop the UK leaving the EU on 31 October without a deal. Although the government says it will obey the law, Johnson also says repeatedly \u2013 as he did again yesterday \u2013 that the UK will definitely leave the EU on 31 October, implying that in the event of no deal he wants to ignore the act. Labour has also said it wants to get further assurances to ensure that the Benn Act achieves what it is supposed to achieve. Both Labour and the Lib Dems are saying that, once they get those absolute guarantees, they will back a general election. But they have not said yet what parliament could do to make the act watertight. We are also getting two urgent questions today. UQs come first, so Joanna Cherry will be up at 11.30am. Hacker House is the company which has Boris Johnson\u2019s close friend, or former close friend, Jennifer Arcuri as a director. It received a \u00a3100,000 grant from the culture department. In normal circumstances this story would probably be dominating the news, but it is probably not Johnson\u2019s primary worry at the moment. This is from Robert Buckland, the justice secretary and lord chancellor. It may be a veiled dig at his cabinet colleague, Jacob Rees-Mogg. (See 10.26am.) Boris Johnson is a winner like the Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola, Michael Gove has said. The Cabinet Office minister told LBC: I think it is only fair to say that Boris is the Pep Guardiola of British politics. Asked about the court \u201chumiliation\u201d, Gove also said: Words like humiliation are good journalistic hyperbole. In response to a question on whether the prime minister\u2019s losing streak would be longer than Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s, Gove said: No, look, the prime minister is a born winner ... he was mayor of London twice, he beat Ken Livingstone twice. Those statements have now been confirmed. Because parliament is reconvening at short notice, there are no questions today, and no bills or debates scheduled. In fact, the agenda is empty. Statements often take about an hour. If Grant Shapps starts at 11.30am, with the Thomas Cook statement, you would expect Johnson to start at around 2.30pm. But urgent questions come before statements, and apparently the Speaker has received 32 applications for urgent questions. (See 10.41am.) Perhaps he might take two or three? If so, you would expect Johnson to speak late afternoon. Boris Johnson is expected to address parliament later now that he is back in the country, Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby reports. Boris Johnson is back in the UK after his trip to the UN in New York. His RAF Voyager touched down a few minutes ago, PA Media reports. Lord Heseltine, the former Conservative deputy prime minister, has criticised Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, for describing the supreme court judgment as a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d. (See 10.08am.) He said Rees-Mogg used to be a \u201cpillar of rectitude\u201d. But in the last few weeks he has been seen lounging on the front bench, and criticising the supreme court, Heseltine said. He went on: This is a Tory, this is someone who believes in the high principles of Conservatism, taking about a constitutional coup when he\u2019s lost a legal case. If I\u2019m arraigned on some sort of criminal charge in the courts, and I then said \u2018Well, of course it\u2019s a personal vendetta\u2019, people would laugh. Yet we\u2019ve got the leader of the House of Commons talking about the unanimous judgment of 11 judges, calling it a constitutional coup. Heseltine is an arch-remainer, and so you would expect him to be critical of Rees-Mogg. But Sir Geoffrey Clifton Brown, a Tory Brexiter, told the same programme that he also thought Rees-Mogg\u2019s language was wrong. Clifton-Brown said: I do think it\u2019s a lapse of judgment on Jacob\u2019s behalf. And, like Lord Heseltine, I\u2019m surprised that he said that. As a result of 24 hours since the judgment, I think cooler minds will prevail. Michael Gove was very careful what he said this morning about criticising the supreme court. We are the party of law and order. We will accept and uphold the judgment. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, reportedly described the supreme court judgment as a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d when cabinet ministers spoke on a conference call last night. This morning, in an interview on Sky News, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister refused to deny the story. Sky\u2019s Sarah-Jane Mee asked him three times if the reports about what Rees-Mogg were wrong, and each time Gove sidestepped the question. When she asked a fourth time, he replied: I don\u2019t recognise that language at all. This sounds like a denial, but actually it isn\u2019t. It is a formula frequently used by politicians at the moment when they want to sound as if they are denying a story but don\u2019t feel comfortable saying it is untrue. The justification for using the phrase is that the reality of what happened was rather different from the way it was reported. But that is true of almost any event reported second-hand as seen by someone who was involved in person. In his Today interview Jeremy Corbyn seemed to rule out Labour voting for a short Commons recess next week to allow the Conservative party conference in Manchester to go ahead. (See 8.41am.) But Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, told Sky\u2019s All Out Politics that the shadow cabinet would be discussing this issue when it meets this morning. She suggested that the Labour party might agree to the Commons not sitting early next week. Asked whether Labour would let a mini conference recess go ahead, she replied: The Labour party is very benevolent and believes in fair play. So we\u2019ll see what [the Conservatives] come forward with. But we want to be benevolent. Normally, when the Conservative conference is on, the Commons is in recess for the whole week. The opposition parties will almost certainly want it to be sitting next Wednesday for PMQs, when Boris Johnson was meant to be delivering his party conference speech, but one option might be to agree for the Commons not to sit for a day or two at the start of the week, so a shortened conference could go ahead. We are likely to know more about what is happening by the end of the day. On the subject of who might head an interim government, if Boris Johnson were to lose a confidence vote and if the opposition parties were to unite behind someone else who could take over solely to negotiate a Brexit delay with the EU and then hold a general election, Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt says Margaret Beckett is a possible candidate. Beckett, a former foreign secretary and former leader of the Commons, is respected by MPs from all sides of the Commons. Unlike Hilary Benn, another Labour backbencher sometimes tipped as leader of an interim, cross-party anti-no-deal government, she would be more amenable to Jeremy Corbyn and his team. She would also be seen as someone with no ambition to hold on to the job beyond a general election. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Simon Murphy. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, was on the Today programme earlier this morning and he said something potentially important about what might happen after a vote of no confidence in the Commons. One plan would be for the opposition parties to install an interim PM who could request a delay to Brexit and then hold a general election. In the past the SNP has been very negative about the idea of installing Jeremy Corbyn as PM. But this morning Blackford indicated that the SNP might support putting Corbyn into Downing Street on this interim PM basis. Asked whether he could support Corbyn taking over in those circumstances, Blackford said: I\u2019m less concerned about the individual. I think it is fair to say that, in such a scenario, the official leader of the opposition is the first point of contact as far as that is concerned. But we are only talking about putting someone in place in order to call an election. On that basis, I wouldn\u2019t be opposed to that [Corbyn being interim PM]. Reaction here from some lobby journalists on Corbyn\u2019s interview. And this, from the Times\u2019 Matt Chorley, on a dig Corbyn made about what he considers to be unfair media coverage. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who has already called on Boris Johnson to resign, says the prime minister should apologise to the Queen and the British people following the supreme court ruling. In a rare appearance on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said Johnson abused his powers. I think he should apologise both to her [the Queen] for the advice he gave her [over suspending parliament] but, more importantly, apologise to the British people for what he\u2019s done in trying to shut down our democracy at a very crucial time when people are very, very worried about what will happen on 31 October. Johnson did speak to the Queen yesterday after the supreme court ruling, although No 10 has refused to say whether he apologised. In his interview Corbyn said his priority was to prevent a no-deal exit but he would not be bounced into a general election before that is secured. Asked about accusations he is scared of holding a general election because of his party\u2019s dire poll ratings, he replied: I\u2019m very happy to have a general election when we\u2019ve taken no deal off the table and the EU has granted that extension. Pressed on his party\u2019s poor polling, he claimed Labour had been a \u201cvery effective opposition\u201d. Corbyn also confirmed Labour will not vote for a short recess for Conservative party conference next week. Reaction here from the editor of Politics Home, Kevin Schofield, to that Gove interview. Michael Gove denied the government did anything wrong by suspending parliament \u2013 despite the supreme court\u2019s ruling yesterday. The Tory cabinet minister, who is in charge of no-deal planning, said he respected the court\u2019s position but would not accept being at fault over prorogation. Asked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme whether the government did something wrong by proroguing parliament, Gove said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe so.\u201d Accused of having a lack of humility during a testy interview, he replied: I absolutely respect the integrity of the supreme court, I respect the judgment, the government will comply with it. That is the law. It is also the case that the principle of judicial review is a well-understood one, it has often been the case that government ministers have taken actions which they believed were right and then the courts, whether it\u2019s been the high court or other courts, have said: \u2018Actually, do you know what? Your exercise of your executive power or your prerogative power was wrong\u2019. Tory grandee Ken Clarke \u2013 who has been tipped as a potential caretaker prime minister \u2013 stops short of calling for Boris Johnson to resign but says the supreme court ruling \u201cleaves us back in a more sensible constitutional position\u201d. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I think it just leaves us back in a more sensible constitutional position. The smash, bang, wallop approach to government of the country in the last few weeks was in danger of leaving us in an extraordinary situation. It was as if we were going to have President Trump but with no checks and balances, just a presidential system. Asked about the next steps in parliament, he said: The most important task is to decide as quickly as we can how we are going to move forward on Brexit. It\u2019s not true, which is being repeated over and over again by ministers, that everybody who\u2019s involved in parliament is just trying to stop Brexit, defy the people \u2026 I voted for Brexit three times with a deal on these three preliminary points. I think the best thing to do is to produce a majority in parliament on a cross-party basis \u2013 which people would normally approve of the parties co-operating \u2013 to actually have those three points disposed of, leave with that preliminary deal and then have an election and get a government that explains what its long-term negotiations are going to be. He added: You might have to add a referendum on whatever interim withdrawal agreement you reach. I\u2019m not in favour of referendums. Having a referendum with such a simplistic question and answer for such a huge number of complex \u2013 they\u2019re quite technical \u2013 issues has caused all the trouble. But if you had to have a referendum to validate the withdrawal agreement or to decide on what the alternatives are if you don\u2019t, I might resign myself to that. Now, whether enough people would resign themselves to that to get a majority in parliament, I\u2019m not sure. According to the Financial Times\u2019 economics editor, Chris Giles, his paper never calls for \u201cheads to roll in editorials\u201d but, in a thundering piece, it says today: \u201cFaced with such a damning judgment, any premier with a shred of respect for British democracy and the responsibilities of his office would resign.\u201d Good morning, folks. Simon Murphy here taking the helm of the live blog ahead of parliament opening its doors to MPs this morning following the extraordinary supreme court ruling yesterday. Another big day of politics in store \u2026 Quite a lot was made of Lady Hale\u2019s remarkable spider brooch yesterday. There is a lovely piece of analysis from the Guardian\u2019s senior fashion writer and senior social reporter here about what Hale might be telling us with her fashion choice, with a brief history of subversive brooches. Since then, I\u2019ve started seeing a few people adding a spider into their Twitter name. Trudy Harpham has done this and offers this explanation as to why. The stunning supreme court ruling, which found Boris Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament \u201cunlawful\u201d, is unsurprisingly the lead on all the newspapers today, with very mixed takes on the news. Lord Adonis is up, he is angry and he is tweeting. The Labour peer has called the Tories \u201ca revolutionary rabble \u2013 with Eton accents\u201d, published an imagined Queen\u2019s speech, and tweeted a quote from a (real) speech from Margaret Thatcher, in which she asserts the importance of an independent judiciary whose decisions aren\u2019t undermined for the rule of law. From the Labour MP Kevin Brennan Overnight, Boris Johnson delivered his inaugural speech to the UN General Assembly. It was, let\u2019s just say, a remarkable speech. My colleague Graham Russell pulled together a selection of quotes from the address, which was meant to be about the opportunities and challenges of technology, in which Johnson ranged from mattresses that can monitor your nightmares to a diet of \u201cterrifying limbless chickens\u201d. Enjoy. 1. \u201cIn the future, voice connectivity will be in every room and almost every object: your mattress will monitor your nightmares; your fridge will beep for more cheese.\u201d 2. \u201cA future Alexa will pretend to take orders. But this Alexa will be watching you, clucking her tongue and stamping her foot.\u201d 3. \u201cYou may keep secrets from your friends, from your parents, your children, your doctor \u2013 even your personal trainer \u2013 but it takes real effort to conceal your thoughts from Google.\u201d 4. \u201cAI \u2013 what will it mean? Helpful robots washing and caring for an ageing population? Or pink-eyed terminators sent back from the future to cull the human race?\u201d 5. \u201cWhat will synthetic biology stand for \u2013 restoring our livers and our eyes with miracle regeneration of the tissues, like some fantastic hangover cure? Or will it bring terrifying limbless chickens to our tables?\u201d 6. \u201cWhen Prometheus brought fire to mankind. In a tube of fennel, as you may remember, that Zeus punished him by chaining him to a Tartarean crag while his liver was pecked out by an eagle. And every time his liver regrew the eagle came back and pecked it again. And this went on forever \u2013 a bit like the experience of Brexit in the UK, if some of our parliamentarians had their way.\u201d Martin Farrer has written this helpful guide to what happens next in parliament. The full guide is here, but here are the answers to a few key questions: What\u2019s happening with parliament on Wednesday? The president of the UK\u2019s highest court, Lady Hale, announced on Tuesday that \u201cparliament has not been prorogued\u201d. The unanimous judgment of all 11 justices was that it was for parliament - and particularly the speakers of both houses - to decide what to do next. Commons Speaker John Bercow has already said that parliament must be reconvened as a \u201cmatter of urgency\u201dand that MPs will sit at 11.30am. The usual Wednesday session of prime minister\u2019s questions would not take place, he said, although there would be opportunities for MPs to hold the Government to account. What does it mean for Brexit? Corbyn was meeting the leaders of the Scottish Nationalists, Lib Dems and other opposition parties last night to work out how to exert maximum pressure to achieve their number one goal: making sure Johnson cannot escape the legal obligation set out in the Benn-Burt bill to delay Brexit if he has not reached a deal of any description by 19 October. Johnson has always insisted he will not request an extension of article 50 and may be hoping that the EU summit on 17 October will provide a breakthrough. Government ministers have repeatedly dodged questions about whether they think there are loopholes they could use to avoid complying with the Benn legislation. But it would risk another potentially humiliating legal battle with the courts if Johnson chose to go down that route. In a hint he could have another go at suspending parliament he said there was a \u201cgood case for getting on with a Queen\u2019s speech\u201d. Does any of this make an election more likely? Johnson would like to have an election as soon as possible, but he has failed to force the necessary legal instrument through parliament. As he put it, \u201cwe have a parliament that is unable to be prorogued\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to have an election\u201d. The opposition parties don\u2019t want an election until Johnson has asked for the Brexit extension. Their calculation is that Johnson will be weakened by doing so because he has made delivering Brexit on 31 October \u201ccome what may\u201d the totem of his prime ministership. They can therefore go to the country portraying him as someone who has failed to deliver his promises. Good morning and welcome to the politics live blog. Yesterday was a fairly extraordinary day on both sides of the Atlantic. Just hours after the supreme court handed down its ruling declaring Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament was \u201cunlawful, void and of no effect\u201d, Nancy Pelosi announced an official impeachment inquiry into US president Donald Trump. Quite the day for brash, blonde world leaders. The Supreme Court verdict has meant that Johnson has had to cut short his visit to New York, where he was attending the United Nations general assembly. He is due to arrive in London around lunchtime on Wednesday after an overnight flight. Parliament will resume at 11:30am, with MPs returning to the House of Commons two weeks after it was suspended in chaotic scenes. A government official in New York with the prime minister said it was impossible to say whether Johnson would appear before the Commons. \u201cI would anticipate there would be statements to the house, I\u2019m just not in a position to say what they will be on,\u201d the official said. Downing Street suggested the prime minister would continue to push for a snap general election, while opposition parties attempted to inflict maximum embarrassment on Johnson. \u201cIn the coming days parliament is likely to be put on the spot to see if it will have an election or whether it will continue to keep the country in zombie-parliament stasis. The only way out is an election and they will be given another opportunity to let the public decide if and when we leave the EU,\u201d said a No 10 source. I\u2019ll be at the helm of this blog in the early hours, before I hand it over to my brilliant colleagues. As always, you can get in touch via Twitter or email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com). We don\u2019t know what the day will bring, but it\u2019s a fairly sure bet that it will bring drama, so buckle up and thanks for reading along.",

Dawn Butler, the shadow secretary for women and equalities, said his reaction showed that Johnson was \u201ca cruel, uncaring, spoilt man\u201d.</p> \n<p>Swinson revealed on Wednesday that she had reported to police a death threat against her young child.</p> \n<p>Amber Rudd, who resigned from Johnson\u2019s cabinet earlier this month, told ITV the prime minister was being \u201cdishonest and dangerous\u201d in his use of language.</p> \n<p>Jess Phillips, the Labour MP and women\u2019s rights campaigner, highlighted an anonymous death threat she had personally received, quoting Johnson\u2019s image that he would rather be dead in a ditch than fail to deliver Brexit. \u201cThat is what will happen to those who fail to deliver Brexit,\u201d it said.</p> \n<p>\u201c10 Downing Street might think we are \u2018humbugs\u2019 about his words but they are literally being used in death threats against me,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI get death threats and still I stand up.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been branded a disgrace for dismissing pleas from Labour MPs to stop using inflammatory language in light of the murder of Jo Cox, telling one that it was \u201chumbug\u201d and another that the best way to honour her was to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Johnson caused uproar in the House of Commons after he responded dismissively to Labour MP Paula Sherriff, who made a heartfelt speech calling on him to stop using language such as \u201csurrender\u201d, \u201ctraitor\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d in relation to Brexit. He also drew gasps when telling Labour\u2019s Tracy Brabin, who was elected to Cox\u2019s seat following the MP\u2019s murder by a far-right extremist a week before the EU referendum, that \u201cthe best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and to bring this country together is, I think, to get Brexit done\u201d. Before her death, Cox had campaigned to remain in the EU. Her widower, Brendan Cox, swiftly condemned the prime minister\u2019s remarks, saying it had left him feeling sick. Johnson\u2019s attitude was lambasted by Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, who called him a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP first minister, who said she felt \u201cdisgust watching Johnson\u201d, describing him as \u201cuntrustworthy, craven, not a shred of concern for the consequences of his words or actions\u201d. Dawn Butler, the shadow secretary for women and equalities, said his reaction showed that Johnson was \u201ca cruel, uncaring, spoilt man\u201d. Swinson revealed on Wednesday that she had reported to police a death threat against her young child. Amber Rudd, who resigned from Johnson\u2019s cabinet earlier this month, told ITV the prime minister was being \u201cdishonest and dangerous\u201d in his use of language. Jess Phillips, the Labour MP and women\u2019s rights campaigner, highlighted an anonymous death threat she had personally received, quoting Johnson\u2019s image that he would rather be dead in a ditch than fail to deliver Brexit. \u201cThat is what will happen to those who fail to deliver Brexit,\u201d it said. \u201c10 Downing Street might think we are \u2018humbugs\u2019 about his words but they are literally being used in death threats against me,\u201d she said. \u201cI get death threats and still I stand up. I don\u2019t surrender to fear and aggression. I don\u2019t surrender to lowest common denominator of fear to votes. I don\u2019t surrender to bullies who call me names. It is not I who have surrendered, it is Boris Johnson. He has surrendered his dignity.\u201d John Bercow, the Speaker, implicitly rebuked Johnson and told MPs that he had also received threats: \u201cEach and every one of us has a responsibility to weigh his or her words ... with care, eloquence, humour but in terms that demonstrate respect for those who hold a point of view that differs from our own.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn called on the Speaker to call together the leaders of all parties to issue a joint declaration \u201copposing any form of abusive language or threats and to put this message out to our entire community that we have to treat each other with respect\u201d. \u201cIf we don\u2019t, then what happens is those on our streets who would do violence feel emboldened to do it and the most vulnerable people in our society suffer as a result of it,\u201d the Labour leader added. Bercow said he was \u201cvery open\u201d to the idea of convening a meeting to draw up a house-wide public statement. After an aggressive debate in parliament, with the prime minister accusing the opposition of signing a \u201csurrender act\u201d over Brexit, Sherriff received applause from the opposition benches for calling on Johnson to stop using such language. \u201cWe should not resort to using offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language for legislation that we do not like and we stand here under the shield of our departed friend with many of us in this place subject to death threats and abuse every single day,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words \u2018surrender act\u2019, \u2018betrayal\u2019, \u2018traitor\u2019 and I for one am sick of it. We must moderate our language and it has to come from the prime minister first. He should be absolutely ashamed of himself.\u201d Johnson replied with a half-smile, saying: \u201cI have to say Mr Speaker I\u2019ve never heard such humbug in all my life.\u201d He was also confronted by Brabin, who criticised him for using language such as \u201csurrender\u201d, arguing it cast his opponents as traitors. \u201cAs the woman who has taken over a seat left by our dear friend Jo Cox, can I ask him in all honesty as a human being please, please will he going forward moderate his language so that we will all feel secure when we\u2019re going about our jobs?\u201d she said. However, Johnson responded by repeating some of the language and suggesting the answer was to deliver Brexit. \u201cOf course there will be an attempt to try to obfuscate the effect of this Act, but it does \u2013 the capitulation act, or the surrender act or whatever you want to call it \u2013 it does, I\u2019m sorry, but it greatly enfeebles, it greatly enfeebles this government\u2019s ability to negotiate. \u201cBut what I will say is that the best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done.\u201d Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, condemned the abuse that MPs had received as \u201cdeeply, deeply unpleasant and troubling\u201d. He said: \u201cWe all have a responsibility to be mild in our language when we\u2019re speaking in this house or outside. \u201cI\u2019m afraid to say it\u2019s something where all sides err from time to time and it would be invidious to pick on individual examples but we have a responsibility of leadership.\u201d Former Tory Anna Soubry raised a point of order to criticise the prime minister\u2019s language: \u201cIt takes a lot to reduce this honourable member to tears ... but I am not alone tonight.

Bacon was a North Norfolk puritan squire, an MP and an implacable opponent of the machinations of courtiers and their ilk.</p> <p>In a private memorandum of 1610 on parliamentary business, he mused on whether \u201cit be fit, to make it preamunire or treason for anie person to maintayne or hold opynion, that the parliament may not bind both king &amp; subject even in matter of prerogative\u201d.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think he ever articulated that view in the House of Commons, but it was certainly an interesting thought and quite consistent with Coke. It remains as relevant today as it was then. It would do Boris Johnson good to forget his classical training and read a bit more history and law, before he digs himself into yet more holes.

      "bodyText": "Gina Miller has courageously initiated and secured a momentous ruling (PM misled the Queen, the people and parliament, 25 September) at great risk to her person and her purse. But why was this action by a private individual the only means of securing \u201cthe absolute supremacy of parliament over the government or executive\u201d? It is all very well clearly establishing the judiciary\u2019s role, but there seems to be a missing part of the process, and that is in the initiation of legal action. Could parliament have triggered legal action against the executive itself? If not, why not? After this judgment, can they do so in the future? We are all very grateful to Gina Miller, but at the same time we should be asking ourselves why our constitution leaves it to the chance that a private individual will take on such a huge risk. Virginia Strauss West Moors, Dorset \u2022 Our democracy is not served when it is subservient to the decisions of unaccountable judges. Now that the supreme court has stepped so decisively into the political realm, it must expect to come under democratic scrutiny. The political views of its members must be revealed, and henceforth candidates for our highest court must be subject to intensive scrutiny by a cross-party committee of parliament. Those who have liked the short-term gain of the supreme court\u2019s judgment might well live to regret its long-term consequences. Francis Bown London \u2022 Your reference (Editorial, 25 September) to the 1611 opinion of Sir Edward Coke that government \u201chath no prerogative but that which the law of the land allows\u201d, along with King James I\u2019s view that this was tantamount to treason, brought back to me a similar sentiment in The Papers of Nathaniel Bacon of Stiffkey, volume VI, 1608-1613. Bacon was a North Norfolk puritan squire, an MP and an implacable opponent of the machinations of courtiers and their ilk. In a private memorandum of 1610 on parliamentary business, he mused on whether \u201cit be fit, to make it preamunire or treason for anie person to maintayne or hold opynion, that the parliament may not bind both king &amp; subject even in matter of prerogative\u201d. I don\u2019t think he ever articulated that view in the House of Commons, but it was certainly an interesting thought and quite consistent with Coke. It remains as relevant today as it was then. It would do Boris Johnson good to forget his classical training and read a bit more history and law, before he digs himself into yet more holes. Your editorial also correctly states that all prerogative powers should now come under parliament\u2019s supervision, and the sooner the better. Dr G Alan Metters Norwich \u2022 The supreme court has made its historic ruling. Parliamentary democracy is reaffirmed by the highest court in the land that parliament has control under the British constitution. The prime minister and his acolytes would do well to note the words of Dr Thomas Fuller in 1733: \u201cBe you never so high, the law is above you.\u201d If he tries it on again let us hope that Buckingham Palace sends a note of displeasure and declines to accept his advice. Paul Faupel Somersham, Cambridgeshire \u2022 As Jeremy Corbyn seems reluctant to table a no-confidence motion in the prime minister, could I now suggest that MPs follow the example of their predecessors in the Rump House of Commons of 1649. Then, King Charles I was accused of treason for using his power to pursue his personal interest rather than the good of the country, although I would hope that MPs spare the prime minister from a similar ultimate fate. Gary Rawlinson Burbage, Wiltshire \u2022 Rafael Behr (Journal, 25 September) is frighteningly correct in his assessment that this will not be a setback to hardline Brexiteers. Those ordinary working people who have been encouraged to blame the EU for their legitimate grievances will be whipped up by the popular press to see Boris as a Robin Hood figure saving them from the out-of-touch MPs and elite judiciary. If he gets a last-minute deal he will be a hero. If he fails he will be a martyr. There will be a lot of angry people out there and Johnson will bounce back with a majority. Jane Ghosh Bristol \u2022 Any chance of the Guardian publishing a front-page picture of the supreme court judges, headlined \u201cFriends of the people\u201d? Alan Pearson Durham \u2022 When he claimed that Hillary Clinton had broken the law, Donald Trump said \u201clock her up\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The most significant political moment of the last decade happened on Tuesday afternoon, not in the supreme court, but on a packed floor of the Brighton Centre during Labour party conference. Delegates overwhelmingly voted in favour of two motions backing a Green New Deal, a <a href=\"https://neweconomics.org/campaigns/green-new-deal\" title=\"\">programme</a> that will decarbonise the UK through a \u201cradical policy package to increase social and economic justice\u201d. One of the motions included a target for the UK to achieve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/24/labour-set-to-commit-to-net-zero-emissions-by-2030\" title=\"\">net-zero emissions by 2030</a>, and one did not \u2013 instead, calling for the UK to act as a world leader on climate change, and to establish a National Climate Service.</p> <p>The 2030 net-zero emissions target now has a very real chance of being included in the Labour party manifesto. Jim Pickard, chief political correspondent for the Financial Times, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PickardJE/status/1176466765502697474\" title=\"\">said</a> the target was \u201cone of the most radical policies by a mainstream political party in my lifetime\u201d.</p> <p>The motions had a tricky journey to the conference floor. On one hand, the GMB union, which represents thousands of workers in the fossil-fuel industry, felt it could not support a 2030 target without a credible transition plan for its members. On the other, Labour for a Green New Deal, a grassroots organisation run on a voluntary basis by young Labour members, felt that the target was non-negotiable, because of the urgency of the situation.</p> <p>And so two separate motions were debated, both were won, and in the end, neither contradicted the other. Instead, the GMB motion could be seen as a challenge to the Labour party and its grassroots activists to come up with a concrete plan to meet the 2030 target. The fact that both motions passed gives the party wriggle room to respond.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The motions put paid to the idea that unions and climate activists need to be in opposition over climate change</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The response to the 2030 target has ranged from jubilant to muted to panicked. Unsurprisingly, the latter type of reaction came from the CBI, which argued that there is \u201cno credible pathway\u201d to a 2030 target. This is the kind of thinking we can expect to see from an organisation that wants climate catastrophe to be averted without major changes to business as usual. But the whole point of a Green New Deal is to respond to the fact that business as usual risks leading human civilisation to collapse.</p> <p>The reality is the science demands a pathway to net-zero emissions by 2030. If that isn\u2019t possible within the current system, then it\u2019s the system that needs to go, not the target. Perhaps the CBI should ask itself what the future for businesses looks like in a world where extreme weather collapses buildings, where British people are transformed into climate refugees as sea levels rise, and where politics is even more fractious and unstable as our representatives struggle to respond to the consequences. If the CBI has factored all of these features of global heating into its assessments, and has concluded that it doesn\u2019t care, I leave it to the reader to judge the legitimacy of its intervention in the debate.</p> <p>The motions put paid to the idea that unions and climate activists need to be in opposition over the climate crisis. To its enormous credit, Labour for a Green New Deal secured the support of nearly all major unions. In fact, Steve Turner, the assistant general secretary of Unite the Union, took to the conference floor to enthusiastically back both motions, and call for climate reparations for the global south. His position, warmly received by assembled delegates, was more upbeat and radical than that of some environmental NGOs.</p> <p>GMB member Joseph Ghayouba spoke passionately about the miners\u2019 strike, a scarring collective memory for the union movement, and a reminder of what happens when governments bring industries to a close without a plan for those working within them.

      "bodyText": "The most significant political moment of the last decade happened on Tuesday afternoon, not in the supreme court, but on a packed floor of the Brighton Centre during Labour party conference. Delegates overwhelmingly voted in favour of two motions backing a Green New Deal, a programme that will decarbonise the UK through a \u201cradical policy package to increase social and economic justice\u201d. One of the motions included a target for the UK to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030, and one did not \u2013 instead, calling for the UK to act as a world leader on climate change, and to establish a National Climate Service. The 2030 net-zero emissions target now has a very real chance of being included in the Labour party manifesto. Jim Pickard, chief political correspondent for the Financial Times, said the target was \u201cone of the most radical policies by a mainstream political party in my lifetime\u201d. The motions had a tricky journey to the conference floor. On one hand, the GMB union, which represents thousands of workers in the fossil-fuel industry, felt it could not support a 2030 target without a credible transition plan for its members. On the other, Labour for a Green New Deal, a grassroots organisation run on a voluntary basis by young Labour members, felt that the target was non-negotiable, because of the urgency of the situation. And so two separate motions were debated, both were won, and in the end, neither contradicted the other. Instead, the GMB motion could be seen as a challenge to the Labour party and its grassroots activists to come up with a concrete plan to meet the 2030 target. The fact that both motions passed gives the party wriggle room to respond. The response to the 2030 target has ranged from jubilant to muted to panicked. Unsurprisingly, the latter type of reaction came from the CBI, which argued that there is \u201cno credible pathway\u201d to a 2030 target. This is the kind of thinking we can expect to see from an organisation that wants climate catastrophe to be averted without major changes to business as usual. But the whole point of a Green New Deal is to respond to the fact that business as usual risks leading human civilisation to collapse. The reality is the science demands a pathway to net-zero emissions by 2030. If that isn\u2019t possible within the current system, then it\u2019s the system that needs to go, not the target. Perhaps the CBI should ask itself what the future for businesses looks like in a world where extreme weather collapses buildings, where British people are transformed into climate refugees as sea levels rise, and where politics is even more fractious and unstable as our representatives struggle to respond to the consequences. If the CBI has factored all of these features of global heating into its assessments, and has concluded that it doesn\u2019t care, I leave it to the reader to judge the legitimacy of its intervention in the debate. The motions put paid to the idea that unions and climate activists need to be in opposition over the climate crisis. To its enormous credit, Labour for a Green New Deal secured the support of nearly all major unions. In fact, Steve Turner, the assistant general secretary of Unite the Union, took to the conference floor to enthusiastically back both motions, and call for climate reparations for the global south. His position, warmly received by assembled delegates, was more upbeat and radical than that of some environmental NGOs. GMB member Joseph Ghayouba spoke passionately about the miners\u2019 strike, a scarring collective memory for the union movement, and a reminder of what happens when governments bring industries to a close without a plan for those working within them. This should be taken as an incentive for activists and unions to work together to flesh out the specifics of policy to ensure that workers, and the unions that represent them, are protected. But the thing that unites organised labour and young activists is a fundamental understanding that the system is broken. A Green New Deal is the opportunity for them to create something new. On an unseasonably warm Friday last week, I watched thousands of schoolchildren descend on Westminster to demand action on the climate emergency. Distressed by news stories that seemed to suggest a ruined world is inevitable, these young people marched on the streets chanting: \u201cAnother world is possible!\u201d And it was through the arcane bureaucratic processes of the Labour party that the building blocks for this new world have been voted through. By the end of this century, society as we understand it will be unrecognisable. Either we will live in a decaying, overheated, brown wasteland like the one the current government is taking us into, or in a world with shorter working hours, cheap public transport, verdant forests and good jobs. These motions were the first step towards the latter. Perhaps one day our grandchildren will ask us where we were when it happened. \u2022 Ellie Mae O\u2019Hagan writes about politics and culture for the Guardian",
