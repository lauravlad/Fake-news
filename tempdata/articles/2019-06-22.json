Johnson\u2019s column \u2013 for which he was paid \u00a3275,000 a year \u2013 regularly made headlines and it had been missed during the year he had reluctantly given it up to be foreign secretary.</p> \n<p>And now he was back. For the paper, it was already paying dividends. Beneath a photo of Johnson, the banner headline on the front page said: \u201cIt\u2019s time to believe in our Great Britain.\u201d And underneath, in smaller type: \u201cBoris Johnson in rallying call for the nation to look to a brighter, post-Brexit future.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a hotel room in central London, someone was giving careful consideration to the text: the man who had guided Donald Trump\u2019s path to power, Steve Bannon. He seemed to have no doubt: the headline, the framing of Johnson\u2019s forthcoming resignation speech, the \u201crallying call\u201d, these were the themes he said he and Johnson had \u201cgone back and forth on text\u201d about over the weekend.</p> \n<p>He was \u201cunequivocal\u201d about it, says Alison Klayman, the film-maker who captured it while shooting her forthcoming documentary, <a href=\"https://www.thebrinkfilm.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>The Brink</em></a>.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s no doubt the video is terrible timing for Johnson. It\u2019s not just that this link to Bannon, like so many things, is something he has denied. It was <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/conservative-party/boris-johnson/news/103241/boris-johnson-blasts-back\" title=\"\">nothing more than \u201ca lefty delusion\u201d,</a> he said last summer.

He conspicuously failed to repeat the previous denials about the pair being in touch, however.</p> \n<p>But Johnson has been caught in lies before and shrugged them off. It\u2019s why Bannon compares him to Trump. He has described him as \u201cone of the most important persons on the world stage today\u201d and drawn the obvious comparison: \u201cLook at some of the scandals around Trump \u2013 the sexism and racism. Nothing sticks. You can\u2019t lay a glove on him.\u201d</p> \n<p>But what\u2019s new and potentially toxic for Johnson is what the apparent relationship with Bannon says about him. Johnson\u2019s love life is once again dominating the news, but it\u2019s his engagement with populist far-right politics and rhetoric that could and should worry other people more.</p> \n<p>Why? Because Bannon is the man who laid the groundwork for Donald Trump\u2019s victory. First as the executive chairman of Breitbart, the far-right website, and then as Trump\u2019s campaign manager and chief strategist. A man who is open in admiration of both Mussolini and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/15/steve-bannon-tommy-robinson-released-from-prison-trump-strategist-lbc-radio-interview\" title=\"\">Stephen Yaxley-Lennon</a>, aka Tommy Robinson, the former EDL leader whom he described as \u201cthe backbone of Britain\u201d and who has been working with openly racist far-right leaders across Europe.</p> \n<p>Tamsin Shaw, a professor of philosophy at New York University who has been researching Bannon\u2019s world view, said: \u201cHe collaborated with publishers of neo-Nazi white nationalist websites to turn Breitbart into a platform for the alt-right.

      "bodyText": "When thousands of Conservative party members booked their tickets to the first leadership hustings in Birmingham, most reasonably believed it would be dominated by talk of Brexit. But as they filed into the city\u2019s sweltering International Convention Centre, there was only one talking point for many party loyalists. The news that police were called to a loud altercation at the home of Boris Johnson and his partner, Carrie Symonds, in the early hours of Friday morning dominated the discussion on the conference floor, even if the former foreign secretary claimed on stage: \u201cI don\u2019t think they want to hear about that kind of thing.\u201d \u201cMy wife and I were taken aback and shocked that such a thing can happen at such an important time for Boris Johnson and the Conservative party. I\u2019ve been something of a Boris fan, I suppose, but I\u2019ve got reservations now,\u201d said Keith Jones, 74, a party member from Halesowen in the West Midlands. Jones said the revelation, first published by the Guardian on Friday night, would play into how he votes for the next party leader. \u201cIt does make you question his mentality, doesn\u2019t it? It doesn\u2019t look good for him, the Conservative party \u2013 on top of the Mark Field incident as well. Everything seems to be going pear-shaped, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Amil Khan, 28, said that \u201cin normal circumstances\u201d the story would have derailed Johnson\u2019s leadership campaign but, he said, most pro-Brexit party members are judging the contest \u201cthrough the prism of Brexit\u201d and they would vote for the candidate most likely to get Britain out of the EU, regardless of what goes on behind closed doors. But, Khan said, the episode did little to alleviate the concerns of those who are already questioning Johnson\u2019s fitness for the highest office. \u201cI find it very difficult to come here to try to support someone I don\u2019t believe actually has the capabilities, the temperament or the experience required to be prime minister,\u201d said Khan, a member of the Birmingham Edgbaston Conservative branch. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened does nothing to change my mind because I\u2019m concerned he\u2019s not able to be the person you would require to be a statesman. \u201cWhen you talk of someone being able to focus on the job that\u2019s required without having distractions. I\u2019m not going to exonerate or take sides because I don\u2019t know what actually happened but it encapsulates the many concerns I had about him.\u201d Young clipboard-carrying activists wearing Back Boris T-shirts hurriedly canvassed the mostly white membership, aged 50 plus, before the debate started, with little sign of a grassroots campaign for his rival Jeremy Hunt. There was a frisson of excitement when the blond Johnson bouldered into the lobby, trailed by television cameras and his campaign team. \u201cI\u2019ll listen to what they have to say \u2013 I\u2019m not happy about it,\u201d said Roy Molson, a Tory councillor on Leek town council. \u201cI\u2019m widowed now but when I was married, my wife and I would have rows. We never had the police come round but every relationship has a falling out at sometime or other and that\u2019s a personal thing. No crime was committed,\u201d he said, adding that Johnson would need to address it because \u201cwe are looking at somebody who is going to potentially be our prime minister and that sort of reputation doesn\u2019t bode well when you\u2019re dealing with many other countries.\u201d Jane McKinven, 58, said she and her husband, Jim, row \u201call the time\u201d and their neighbour \u2013 who happens to be Michael Fabricant MP \u2013 has never complained. \u201cHe\u2019s in the middle of a leadership race, it\u2019s going to get tense,\u201d she said of Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s just stress, I\u2019m sure, and it really shouldn\u2019t be out there for the media pulling at every little piece of it.\u201d Her husband, Jim, said Johnson needed to nip the story in the bud to stop his rivals from making political capital out of it. \u201cI think Boris needs to address it because those who don\u2019t like Boris are scoring political points from it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a domestic argument, that\u2019s all.\u201d Suzanne Webb, a Tory councillor on Birmingham city council, said she did not believe the episode was relevant, describing it as \u201cbehind closed doors, end of\u201d. Webb said she was \u201ctotally undecided\u201d over which candidate to back but she was not concerned by the episode.",
