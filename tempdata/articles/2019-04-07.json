On Wednesday evening Corbyn, a lifelong Eurosceptic leading a mainly Remain-inclined party, called a special meeting of his shadow cabinet to debrief it on progress in the cross-party talks. Labour\u2019s internal tensions and divisions on Brexit policy boiled over.

Another member of the shadow cabinet, health spokesman Jon Ashworth, had warned Corbyn in the meeting that all previous experiments in cooperation with the Tories had ended in disaster for Labour and that Corbyn should heed history\u2019s lessons. Colleagues thought he had in mind the party\u2019s first prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, who is still regarded by many as a traitor for running a government with the Conservatives during the great depression.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>What makes it impossible in practice is that neither leader can afford to give any real ground.

But managing division by avoiding hard choices is no longer possible if a consensus is to be reached. The UK is due to leave the EU without a deal on 12 April unless the House of Commons reaches agreement. It is decision time. But the moment of choosing what sort of Brexit the country should have has brought internal divisions even more to the fore. As one former Tory minister who resigned recently over Brexit said on Wednesday: \u201cA cross-party solution to Brexit should be possible \u2013 in theory. What makes it impossible in practice is that neither leader can afford to give any real ground. If they do, they know the consequences would be to split their parties irreparably. Take the issue of a permanent customs union which Labour is demanding. If May endorses that half her cabinet resigns. Corbyn is trapped too.

We\u2019re all just screwed.\u201d</p> \n<p>If there is agreement on one thing at Westminster these days, it is that the two main parties almost certainly cannot survive Brexit in their current forms. Neither the Conservatives nor Labour offers a comfortable home either for convinced Brexiters or ardent Remainers. Conversations with MPs and ministers about the future of politics post-Brexit increasingly move towards a conclusion that Brexit will accelerate a realignment. Two-thirds of the Tory party is made up of hardline Brexiters and the other third comprises soft and hard Remainers. As one Remainer Tory MP put it: \u201cAfter all this, it is impossible to see the likes of Dominic Grieve [strongly Remain] sitting in the same party as Jacob Rees-Mogg or Boris Johnson. A split is coming.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"944c250c464ceaf3f18ffb946b5e090028cf6de3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/944c250c464ceaf3f18ffb946b5e090028cf6de3/509_0_1229_1536/800.jpg\" alt=\"Commons water torture \u2026 the Commons is suspended after water pours through the ceiling, soaking part of the press gallery and damaging light fittings.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Commons water torture \u2026 the Commons is suspended after water pours through the ceiling, soaking part of the press gallery and damaging light fittings.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @NeilDotObrien/Twitter</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For Labour, the divide is more than just about Brexit, but has been bought into sharper focus by it. It is also about what kind of party Labour is \u2013 a Corbynite leftwing force or a social democratic, strongly internationalist one. The former Labour cabinet minister Lord Adonis said: \u201cBrexit is the dominating issue for Labour\u2019s social democrats. Labour will split if Britain leaves the EU and the party is complicit in Brexit, because there is no viable policy for prosperity and equality while pursuing a Thatcherite Brexit.\u201d Already eight Labour MPs have quit the party to join the pro-EU Independent Group. Three Tory MPs have joined them. More could soon follow. Last week the Tory MP Nick Boles said he could no longer sit as a Conservative MP after his compromise plan on Brexit was rejected by many of his colleagues. Slowly, the old order is changing. Corbyn\u2019s deputy Watson is forming a group of around 100 MPs from the non-Corbynite wing of the party. The group\u2019s backers say it is a \u201cnon-Marxist, social democratic\u201d grouping \u201cwithin Labour\u201d. Soon after Easter it will begin work on its own policy ideas, separate from Corbyn\u2019s team.</p> \n<p>As new alliances form, there are signs that voters are deserting the two main parties as a result of their Brexit divisions. On Friday, Labour retained the seat of Newport West but both Labour and the Tories saw their share of the vote fall as smaller parties, including Ukip and the pro-EU Greens, benefited.</p> \n<p>Political polling expert David Cowling says the conditions are ripe for change. \u201cThe Conservative-Labour vote share in 2017 was 84%. In the 15 polls last month it was an average 71%. Political realignment had been prophesied before but realigning MPs has proved easier than realigning voters. However, although our electoral system is heavily stacked against change, the public mood has seldom been more fertile for new political growth.\u201d</p> \n<p>If, as seems increasingly likely, Brexit is delayed and the UK is forced to take part in European elections, they could provide opportunities for new forces in British politics.

From the other side of the Brexit debate, Nigel Farage will lead his new Brexit party. On Friday, Farage put out two tweets looking forward to the European elections. \u201cThis is an exciting moment. We have arrived at a tipping point. The splits affecting the Conservatives and Labour have become so significant they begin to fall apart,\u201d was one.

      "body": "<h2>Scenario 1<br>A cross-party deal</h2> <p><strong>How it could happen</strong><br><strong> </strong>Despite all the cynicism surrounding Theresa May\u2019s offer to hold cross-party talks with Jeremy Corbyn and Labour, the two sides surprise everyone by coming together and backing a compromise plan that they think could command a majority in parliament. It would be based around building on May\u2019s existing deal, adding a permanent customs union, extra protections around workers\u2019 rights and legal guarantees making it harder for a future Tory leader to tear it up.<br><strong>The problems </strong><br>Such a compromise would cause huge anger among a large number of Tory MPs and precipitate further government resignations. Labour would also take heavy criticism from members and MPs if it were seen to facilitate Brexit. Expect both sides to find a way to allow the talks to run their course \u2013 and then blame the other side for the lack of progress.<br><strong>Likelihood </strong><br>Don\u2019t hold your breath. \u2605 (Star ratings out of five)</p> <h2>Scenario 2<br>Binding votes agreed</h2> <p><strong>How it could happen</strong> <br>Having failed to secure a cross-party deal, May asks Labour to sign up to a new process of votes in the House of Commons, designed to whittle down options until a majority of MPs backs one plan. Both the government and Labour agree to abide by whatever emerges as the favoured option, finally allowing Britain to leave and everyone to move on.<br><strong>The problems</strong> <br>While May has suggested she wants to look at the idea of holding a series of binding Brexit votes, in practice the concept presents huge issues for both party leaders. Would the government really implement an option it has been against? Would such an unstable process really create the stable majority required to pass the legislation needed to implement Brexit? And would Labour survive a process that risks killing off a second referendum and delivering Brexit?<br><strong>Likelihood </strong><br>A potential crisis for both parties, which they are likely to avoid. \u2605\u2605</p> <h2>Scenario 3<br>Short EU membership extension</h2> <p><strong>How it could happen</strong> <br>May asks for an extension until the end of June, with the option of leaving earlier should a Brexit deal be passed by the Commons. It would mean Britain would leave the EU before the new European parliament sits for the first time \u2013 although the UK would have had to elect MEPs. Her request is accepted by weary EU leaders, who do not want the Brexit process to drag on for ever.<br><strong>The problems</strong> <br>May has asked for this extension before and had it rejected. There is no sign that she would get a different answer a second time \u2013 and EU figures are already making it clear that the idea is a non-starter. Most Tories believe that May is making the request in the knowledge that she will be forced to accept a longer extension.<br><strong>Likelihood </strong><br>May could ask, but the EU already seems to have rejected her request. \u2605\u2605</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f8bde25eec63a5d6abfcd090f65fefed00aee84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f8bde25eec63a5d6abfcd090f65fefed00aee84/0_141_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa Maywith Donald Tusk, president of the European council.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May asks Donald Tusk, president of the European council for a delay on Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julien Warnand/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Scenario 4<br>Long EU membership extension, with a get-out clause</h2> <p><strong>How it could happen</strong> <br>Tired of having to deal with the latest Brexit deadline but unwilling to embrace a disastrous no-deal outcome, the EU opts to kick the whole problem far down the road by handing May an extension of as much as a year, with the option of leaving earlier should a deal be agreed in parliament.<br><strong>The problems</strong> <br>A long extension would cause huge anger on the Tory benches and plunge the party into a European election campaign certain to be full of rancour and disillusionment. More ministers could resign as a result of such a delay. Worst of all, it would allow the whole Brexit debate to rumble into next year.<br><strong>Likelihood </strong><br>The EU is likely to allow everyone to go away and think again. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <h2>Scenario 5<br>No deal</h2> <p><strong>How it could happen </strong><br>EU unity finally breaks down after the united front it has shown since the Brexit referendum, meaning that no agreement can be reached on handing Britain an extension.

      "bodyText": "Scenario 1 A cross-party deal How it could happen Despite all the cynicism surrounding Theresa May\u2019s offer to hold cross-party talks with Jeremy Corbyn and Labour, the two sides surprise everyone by coming together and backing a compromise plan that they think could command a majority in parliament. It would be based around building on May\u2019s existing deal, adding a permanent customs union, extra protections around workers\u2019 rights and legal guarantees making it harder for a future Tory leader to tear it up. The problems Such a compromise would cause huge anger among a large number of Tory MPs and precipitate further government resignations. Labour would also take heavy criticism from members and MPs if it were seen to facilitate Brexit. Expect both sides to find a way to allow the talks to run their course \u2013 and then blame the other side for the lack of progress. Likelihood Don\u2019t hold your breath. \u2605 (Star ratings out of five) Scenario 2 Binding votes agreed How it could happen Having failed to secure a cross-party deal, May asks Labour to sign up to a new process of votes in the House of Commons, designed to whittle down options until a majority of MPs backs one plan. Both the government and Labour agree to abide by whatever emerges as the favoured option, finally allowing Britain to leave and everyone to move on. The problems While May has suggested she wants to look at the idea of holding a series of binding Brexit votes, in practice the concept presents huge issues for both party leaders. Would the government really implement an option it has been against? Would such an unstable process really create the stable majority required to pass the legislation needed to implement Brexit? And would Labour survive a process that risks killing off a second referendum and delivering Brexit? Likelihood A potential crisis for both parties, which they are likely to avoid. \u2605\u2605 Scenario 3 Short EU membership extension How it could happen May asks for an extension until the end of June, with the option of leaving earlier should a Brexit deal be passed by the Commons. It would mean Britain would leave the EU before the new European parliament sits for the first time \u2013 although the UK would have had to elect MEPs. Her request is accepted by weary EU leaders, who do not want the Brexit process to drag on for ever. The problems May has asked for this extension before and had it rejected. There is no sign that she would get a different answer a second time \u2013 and EU figures are already making it clear that the idea is a non-starter. Most Tories believe that May is making the request in the knowledge that she will be forced to accept a longer extension. Likelihood May could ask, but the EU already seems to have rejected her request. \u2605\u2605 Scenario 4 Long EU membership extension, with a get-out clause How it could happen Tired of having to deal with the latest Brexit deadline but unwilling to embrace a disastrous no-deal outcome, the EU opts to kick the whole problem far down the road by handing May an extension of as much as a year, with the option of leaving earlier should a deal be agreed in parliament. The problems A long extension would cause huge anger on the Tory benches and plunge the party into a European election campaign certain to be full of rancour and disillusionment. More ministers could resign as a result of such a delay. Worst of all, it would allow the whole Brexit debate to rumble into next year. Likelihood The EU is likely to allow everyone to go away and think again. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Scenario 5 No deal How it could happen EU unity finally breaks down after the united front it has shown since the Brexit referendum, meaning that no agreement can be reached on handing Britain an extension. France and other nations take a hard line, insisting that it is better to see Britain crash out than have Brexit chaos infect the EU\u2019s future any longer. As a result, Britain leaves the EU with no deal on Friday. The problems There are some pro-Brexit ministers and former ministers who say the problems of a no-deal Brexit have been overblown, but the prevailing assumption, both at the top of the EU and in government, is that it would be a disaster for both sides and hit the UK\u2019s economy hard. In reality, the downsides are great enough that both sides will avoid no deal. Likelihood France and others are talking tough, but no deal is bad for everyone. \u2605\u2605",
