Often MPs are quite happy to overlook detail but, in this case, a poorly worded bill could give Johnson the opportunity to wriggle out of getting an extension to the Brexit deadline.

Corbyn wants the former for the same reason his opponents in the Lib Dems and anti-no deal Tories are so against it: he would be in Downing Street and therefore voters would find it much easier to imagine him as prime minister when asked to do so in an election.

But politically this is highly awkward for anti-Brexit campaigners. It will just reinforce Boris Johnson\u2019s already planned election campaign message that he is standing up for the people against the opponents of democracy.

      "body": "<p>For much of August the plan<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/24/johnson-seeks-legal-advice-parliament-closure\" title=\"\"> to shut down parliament for five weeks</a> was kept a very tight secret at the heart of government. For the few Whitehall officials who were made aware of it early on, however, it was not difficult to decipher whose fingerprints were all over it. It was clear to that small group that the bombshell idea had been hatched by Boris Johnson\u2019s closest adviser, Dominic Cummings, and No 10\u2019s director of legislative affairs, Nikki da Costa.</p> \n<p>Cummings has long been known at Westminster for his disdain for Whitehall and the way the entire system of British government works. He doesn\u2019t mince his words or tolerate those he regards as fools. \u201cIf he meets resistance from ministers or officials he will just tell them to fuck off, whoever they are,\u201d said one Whitehall source, who has worked with him.</p> \n<p>In 2016 Cummings ran the successful Vote Leave campaign to take the UK out of the EU, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/commons-report-rules-dominic-cummings-in-contempt-of-parliament\" title=\"\">and was later held in contempt of parliament</a> for failing to appear before a select committee investigating the spread of fake news during the Brexit referendum.</p> \n<p>Da Costa, on the other hand, is less well known and far less abrasive. She served under Theresa May for a time advising on parliamentary issues. As well being a Brexiter, Da Costa has a fascination with parliament and, say friends, believes in the need to strengthen the power of the executive in relation to parliament in order to get business done.</p> \n<p>Having found themselves thrown together in Johnson\u2019s new team at No 10 in July, Cummings and Da Costa found common cause. \u201cIt was obvious that prorogation was the Cummings/Da Costa masterplan,\u201d said an insider.</p> \n<p>Apart from the prime minister, who insisted repeatedly during his campaign for the Tory leadership that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/27/boris-johnson-refuses-rule-out-forcing-through-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">he was \u201cnot attracted\u201d to the idea</a> of proroguing parliament while never actually ruling it out, few even in the cabinet heard anything about what was being planned until a week ago.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a6e3847f-f534-48fa-9919-609e4c49cad2\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(August 24, 2019)</i>&nbsp;<strong> The story breaks</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Observer breaks the story that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/24/johnson-seeks-legal-advice-parliament-closure\">Boris Johnson has sought legal advice on closing parliament for five weeks</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(August 27, 2019)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Leaks spread</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Other media organisations begin to receive leaks that Johnson will make a statement on prorogation</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(August 28, 2019)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Visit to Balmoral</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Three privy counsellors, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, travel to Balmoral to tell the Queen of the prorogation plan.

Gove spoke out strongly against prorogation during his failed leadership bid: \u201cI think it would be wrong for many reasons. I think it would not be true to the best traditions of British democracy,\u201d he said. But that was the past, and once moves were in train, Gove put up no resistance.</p> \n<p>Some time in mid to late August, however, the circle of those in the know had to widen. With the clock ticking towards parliament\u2019s return on 3 September, advice on the legality of a five-week prorogration before a Queen\u2019s speech on 14 October had to be sought. The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, became formally involved, and was asked by the prime minister whether such a constitutionally momentous move was legally possible.</p> \n<p>Emails were exchanged between a wider group of government officials as the planning intensified. Cummings will have known that shutting down parliament when MPs wanted to debate urgent issues around Brexit would provoke uproar among Remainers and MPs who were against no deal. Cross-party groups of MPs spent the summer planning how to use parliamentary procedures and pass legislation to force Johnson to ask the EU for a further Brexit extension if he could not strike a deal within weeks.</p> \n<p>Some officials were so horrified when they heard about the plan that they felt they had to act. \u201cThere is a team of people in there who are determined to fight this,\u201d the <em>Observer</em> was told 10 days ago. Last Friday an email between a Whitehall official and No 10 was leaked to this newspaper. It made clear that Johnson had approached Cox for advice on a five-week suspension from around 9 September to 14 October. Cox\u2019s initial view, the correspondence made clear, was that it would probably be legal, unless various court actions being planned by Remainers to block prorogation were successful. Downing Street\u2019s official response when asked about the leak was, at first, muted. \u201cNo 10 officials ask for legal and policy advice every day,\u201d said a government source.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"472bf1811cca536a312312d435f9ef04c1bdcb5c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/472bf1811cca536a312312d435f9ef04c1bdcb5c/0_156_2902_3625/801.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings arrives at Downing Street.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings arrives at Downing Street.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Veysey/Rex</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But when<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/24/johnson-seeks-legal-advice-parliament-closure\" title=\"\"> the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/24/johnson-seeks-legal-advice-parliament-closure\" title=\"\">Observer</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/24/johnson-seeks-legal-advice-parliament-closure\" title=\"\"> story </a>broke last Saturday evening, as Johnson and his team were in Biarritz for the G7 summit preparing for meetings with US president Donald Trump and EU council president Donald Tusk the next day, Downing Street changed tack and tried to dismiss the story in a way that was to backfire spectacularly.</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s press team issued a statement saying that \u201cthe claim that the government is considering proroguing parliament in September in order to stop MPs debating Brexit is entirely false\u201d. It did not deny that the attorney general had been consulted about prorogation but its intent was clear: to create the impression that shutting down parliament was not going to happen.</p> \n<p>But less than 72 hours later more leaks were to follow from people inside the government machine to media organisations saying that the prime minister was to make an announcement about prorogation on Wednesday morning. After the BBC got wind of the new leaks, some senior staff were initially dubious that they were genuine, given No 10\u2019s previous denials. When Johnson announced the exact same plan on which his team had poured buckets of cold water four days earlier, large sections of the media, as well as MPs and much of the country, were understandably furious.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, as MPs from all the main opposition parties continued urgent talks on how to use their now far smaller window of parliamentary time (realistically just a few days before parliament is shut down early next week) to pass legislation to block no deal and force another Brexit extension,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/31/thousands-protest-against-boris-johnson-parliament-shutdown-uk-brexit\" title=\"\"> anger erupted on streets</a> across the UK.</p> \n<p>Tens of thousands of people took part in almost 100 demonstrations, holding banners saying \u201cstop the coup\u201d and \u201csave our democracy\u201d. In London, crowds chanted outside the gates of Downing Street. The Labour MP Jess Phillips, who backs a second Brexit referendum, said: \u201cIt is vital that in this political emergency, we do not let anyone separate parliament from the people. In the House of Commons next week, I will proudly be voting with MPs of all parties to stop no deal from being forced on the people. And on the streets outside, in towns and cities across Britain, people will be protesting to defend our parliament and our most cherished democratic rights against an executive which is now out of control.\u201d</p> \n<p>But it was not only on the streets that tempers were fraying and divisions deepening. Inside government it emerged that Cummings, angry at how Whitehall had been leaking like a sieve and desperate to halt the plans of anti-no deal MPs by imposing iron discipline, had taken it upon himself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/30/sajid-javid-was-not-told-in-advance-of-advisers-sacking-by-cummings\" title=\"\">to summarily sack Sonia Khan,</a> one of the chancellor of the exchequer Sajid Javid\u2019s key advisers, on Thursday.</p> \n<p>Cummings suspected Khan had been talking to Philip Hammond, Javid\u2019s predecessor as chancellor, for whom she used to work and who is now at the centre of the anti-no deal alliance of senior MPs. Cummings summoned Khan from the Treasury to No 10 on Thursday evening without telling the new chancellor and asked if she had been in contact with Hammond or any of his inner circle.</p> \n<p>She said she had not had any direct contact with Hammond since she had started working for Javid in July and had only met one of his former aides socially a fortnight before. Cummings then asked to see her two mobile phones, one used for work and the other for private calls.

      "bodyText": "For much of August the plan to shut down parliament for five weeks was kept a very tight secret at the heart of government. For the few Whitehall officials who were made aware of it early on, however, it was not difficult to decipher whose fingerprints were all over it. It was clear to that small group that the bombshell idea had been hatched by Boris Johnson\u2019s closest adviser, Dominic Cummings, and No 10\u2019s director of legislative affairs, Nikki da Costa. Cummings has long been known at Westminster for his disdain for Whitehall and the way the entire system of British government works. He doesn\u2019t mince his words or tolerate those he regards as fools. \u201cIf he meets resistance from ministers or officials he will just tell them to fuck off, whoever they are,\u201d said one Whitehall source, who has worked with him. In 2016 Cummings ran the successful Vote Leave campaign to take the UK out of the EU, and was later held in contempt of parliament for failing to appear before a select committee investigating the spread of fake news during the Brexit referendum. Da Costa, on the other hand, is less well known and far less abrasive. She served under Theresa May for a time advising on parliamentary issues. As well being a Brexiter, Da Costa has a fascination with parliament and, say friends, believes in the need to strengthen the power of the executive in relation to parliament in order to get business done. Having found themselves thrown together in Johnson\u2019s new team at No 10 in July, Cummings and Da Costa found common cause. \u201cIt was obvious that prorogation was the Cummings/Da Costa masterplan,\u201d said an insider. Apart from the prime minister, who insisted repeatedly during his campaign for the Tory leadership that he was \u201cnot attracted\u201d to the idea of proroguing parliament while never actually ruling it out, few even in the cabinet heard anything about what was being planned until a week ago. One who was kept in the loop was Michael Gove, who had employed Cummings as his special adviser when education secretary, and is now in charge of no-deal preparations. Gove spoke out strongly against prorogation during his failed leadership bid: \u201cI think it would be wrong for many reasons. I think it would not be true to the best traditions of British democracy,\u201d he said. But that was the past, and once moves were in train, Gove put up no resistance. Some time in mid to late August, however, the circle of those in the know had to widen. With the clock ticking towards parliament\u2019s return on 3 September, advice on the legality of a five-week prorogration before a Queen\u2019s speech on 14 October had to be sought. The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, became formally involved, and was asked by the prime minister whether such a constitutionally momentous move was legally possible. Emails were exchanged between a wider group of government officials as the planning intensified. Cummings will have known that shutting down parliament when MPs wanted to debate urgent issues around Brexit would provoke uproar among Remainers and MPs who were against no deal. Cross-party groups of MPs spent the summer planning how to use parliamentary procedures and pass legislation to force Johnson to ask the EU for a further Brexit extension if he could not strike a deal within weeks. Some officials were so horrified when they heard about the plan that they felt they had to act. \u201cThere is a team of people in there who are determined to fight this,\u201d the Observer was told 10 days ago. Last Friday an email between a Whitehall official and No 10 was leaked to this newspaper. It made clear that Johnson had approached Cox for advice on a five-week suspension from around 9 September to 14 October. Cox\u2019s initial view, the correspondence made clear, was that it would probably be legal, unless various court actions being planned by Remainers to block prorogation were successful. Downing Street\u2019s official response when asked about the leak was, at first, muted. \u201cNo 10 officials ask for legal and policy advice every day,\u201d said a government source. But when the Observer story broke last Saturday evening, as Johnson and his team were in Biarritz for the G7 summit preparing for meetings with US president Donald Trump and EU council president Donald Tusk the next day, Downing Street changed tack and tried to dismiss the story in a way that was to backfire spectacularly. Johnson\u2019s press team issued a statement saying that \u201cthe claim that the government is considering proroguing parliament in September in order to stop MPs debating Brexit is entirely false\u201d. It did not deny that the attorney general had been consulted about prorogation but its intent was clear: to create the impression that shutting down parliament was not going to happen. But less than 72 hours later more leaks were to follow from people inside the government machine to media organisations saying that the prime minister was to make an announcement about prorogation on Wednesday morning. After the BBC got wind of the new leaks, some senior staff were initially dubious that they were genuine, given No 10\u2019s previous denials. When Johnson announced the exact same plan on which his team had poured buckets of cold water four days earlier, large sections of the media, as well as MPs and much of the country, were understandably furious. On Saturday, as MPs from all the main opposition parties continued urgent talks on how to use their now far smaller window of parliamentary time (realistically just a few days before parliament is shut down early next week) to pass legislation to block no deal and force another Brexit extension, anger erupted on streets across the UK. Tens of thousands of people took part in almost 100 demonstrations, holding banners saying \u201cstop the coup\u201d and \u201csave our democracy\u201d. In London, crowds chanted outside the gates of Downing Street. The Labour MP Jess Phillips, who backs a second Brexit referendum, said: \u201cIt is vital that in this political emergency, we do not let anyone separate parliament from the people. In the House of Commons next week, I will proudly be voting with MPs of all parties to stop no deal from being forced on the people. And on the streets outside, in towns and cities across Britain, people will be protesting to defend our parliament and our most cherished democratic rights against an executive which is now out of control.\u201d But it was not only on the streets that tempers were fraying and divisions deepening. Inside government it emerged that Cummings, angry at how Whitehall had been leaking like a sieve and desperate to halt the plans of anti-no deal MPs by imposing iron discipline, had taken it upon himself to summarily sack Sonia Khan, one of the chancellor of the exchequer Sajid Javid\u2019s key advisers, on Thursday. Cummings suspected Khan had been talking to Philip Hammond, Javid\u2019s predecessor as chancellor, for whom she used to work and who is now at the centre of the anti-no deal alliance of senior MPs. Cummings summoned Khan from the Treasury to No 10 on Thursday evening without telling the new chancellor and asked if she had been in contact with Hammond or any of his inner circle. She said she had not had any direct contact with Hammond since she had started working for Javid in July and had only met one of his former aides socially a fortnight before. Cummings then asked to see her two mobile phones, one used for work and the other for private calls. He saw she had spoken to the same friend and ex-colleague a week previously and immediately told Khan she was fired. He then left the office in No 10 and summoned an armed policeman to march Khan out of Downing Street. As she was escorted out other advisers looked on in amazement. A former government insider said a culture of fear had taken hold: \u201cWhat Cummings is up to makes me sick. It is appalling. Sonia was very shaken. His behaviour makes Fi and Nick [Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy who ran No 10 with iron fists before being fired by Theresa May after the 2017 general election debacle] look collegiate.\u201d On Friday Javid held an angry meeting with Johnson about the dismissal, demanding to know why he had not been informed and complaining that Cummings was out of control. Others inside government said Cummings was trying to establish a \u201creign of terror\u201d. \u201cIt is simply outrageous. You can\u2019t be sacked for phoning a friend,\u201d said a source. Another insider said Cummings had been particularly \u201cspooked\u201d and angered by Tuesday\u2019s leak about the prorogation announcement. The premature release of the plan meant a carefully organised schedule that involved telling the Queen of the prorogation at Balmoral the next day, had to be reorganised. The original plan had been for a group of privy counsellors \u2013 House of Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg, Lords leader Baroness Evans and government chief whip Mark Spencer \u2013 to travel to Scotland to meet the Queen at midday and then hold a cabinet conference call to tell ministers what was happening an hour later.
