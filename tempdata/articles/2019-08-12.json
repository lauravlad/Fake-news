      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is preparing for a parliamentary battle against MPs trying to block a no-deal Brexit in the second week of September, as his cross-party opponents continue to be divided about the best way to stop the UK crashing out on 31 October. A senior government source said Downing Street believed the first legislative showdown over no deal would be on 9 September, when parliament is due to debate a progress report on power-sharing in Northern Ireland. The expectation is that a cross-party group of MPs will try to use this to carve out time to legislate against a no-deal Brexit by requesting an extension to article 50. The prime minister could face a confidence motion brought by Jeremy Corbyn aimed at collapsing his government as early as 3 September, when MPs return from their summer break. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said on Monday that an early confidence motion in the prime minister \u201chas to be an option\u201d. However, senior Labour and rebel Conservative sources are sceptical about whether they have the numbers to defeat Johnson at this stage, as many Tory MPs still believe there are legislative routes to prevent a no-deal Brexit that have to be exhausted first. One source close to a former cabinet minister, who is coordinating efforts to stop no-deal, said they believe at least five or six Conservative MPs would be needed to vote against Johnson\u2019s government, but \u201cthe numbers aren\u2019t there yet\u201d. This is because several independent MPs and possibly some Labour MPs opposed to a second referendum could abstain or vote with the government. One independent MP said speculation about a no-confidence vote immediately after recess was \u201cjumping ahead of events\u201d. \u201cYou need Tory rebels to win, and they have to have a reason to support it,\u201d the MP said. \u201cIt can\u2019t just be tokenistic, and it can\u2019t just be because Boris isn\u2019t the leader you wanted. There has to be a coherent reason and a coherent subsequent plan to stop no deal.\u201d As uncertainty clouds the confidence vote, there are several different cross-party groups trying to devise legislative ways to stop a no-deal Brexit involving senior Tory MPs such as Dominic Grieve and Philip Hammond. However, they have not yet agreed on a single strategy, and the Institute for Government warned on Sunday that MPs opposed to no-deal may \u201cfind few opportunities to make their move \u2013 and time is running out\u201d. A senior government source said Downing Street expects the first showdown to happen on 9 September because the government is bound by law to provide a report on Northern Ireland on 4 September and to then debate it in parliament within five days. Boris Johnson may meet key EU leaders, such as Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, but not Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar, before the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, at the end of August. The EU is adamant that the backstop is not up for renegotiation, but the senior government source said there was still hope in Downing Street that a deal might be possible if it became clear that parliament could not prevent no deal on 31 October. The government source said No 10 was not expecting any breakthrough with the EU until Brussels had seen what happens in the first weeks of September, as the parliamentary battle plays out. One Tory MP fighting against no deal said this was part of No 10\u2019s effort to unfairly blame their side for frustrating a deal with Brussels, and Downing Street had been quite successful in \u201cpicking off\u201d colleagues who were worried about being held responsible. However, the MP said a vote of no confidence in Johnson\u2019s government would have more chance of success later in October, as the reality of no-deal drew nearer and its consequences became more apparent. They said this was a \u201cvery nuclear option\u201d that would only be tried as a last resort, given the risk that this approach could backfire and lead to an election after a no-deal Brexit. If a no-confidence vote was passed, MPs would first have 14 days to form an alternative government, but if this was unsuccessful an election would be triggered.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods. This has also been referred to by government ministers as an \"Australia-style deal\". Australia does not have a free trade agreement with the EU.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated.

      "bodyText": "Downing Street believes rebel MPs will try to make a move to stop a no-deal Brexit in the second week of September, with the EU unlikely to respond until after that battle has played out. A senior government source said the date for a parliamentary battle was expected to be 9 September \u2013 a week after MPs return from their summer break. Boris Johnson may meet key EU leaders, such as Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, but not Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar, before the G7 summit in Biarritz, France at the end of August. However, No 10 is not expecting any breakthrough until the EU has seen what happens in the first weeks of September, when an alliance of Tory and opposition MPs try to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. The EU is adamant that the backstop is not up for renegotiation but the senior government source said there is still hope in Downing Street that a deal is possible if it becomes clear that parliament could not prevent no deal on 31 October. Labour has been mulling an immediate confidence vote in Johnson\u2019s government in the first week of September but will only go ahead if there are enough Conservative MPs willing to bring down their own prime minister. Rebel Tory MPs, led by Dominic Grieve and Philip Hammond, are working behind the scenes over the summer to stop a no-deal Brexit. They have explored collapsing the government and setting up an alternative, temporary \u201cunity government\u201d to request an extension to article 50, but Labour has made clear it would not support a centrist candidate, such as Ken Clarke or Yvette Cooper, to be temporary PM. Senior Conservative MPs on the rebel side also stressed to the Guardian that this was a \u201cvery nuclear option\u201d that would only be tried as a last resort, given the risk this approach could backfire and lead to an election after a no-deal Brexit. If a no-confidence vote passed, MPs would first have 14 days to form an alternative government, but if unsuccessful, an election would be triggered. In this event, Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, has threatened to press ahead with Brexit on 31 October with or without a deal and schedule the election for the days after that date, with parliament shut down. Rebel Tories believe there could be a couple of Conservative MPs willing to quit the party or defect in order to bring down Johnson, but not enough for Labour to be completely sure of success in the first week of September. The large number of independent MPs whose support is not clear and the possibility of some pro-Brexit Labour MPs abstaining add to the uncertainty. Instead, leading Conservatives in the \u201cno to no deal\u201d campaign are prioritising legislative routes. Downing Street expects 9 September to be the first opportunity for a legislative battle, as the government is bound by law to provide a report on Northern Ireland on 4 September and to then debate it in parliament for five days. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said Johnson remained \u201cvery clear in his determination to want to get a deal\u201d. He said: \u201cHe believes a deal is in the UK\u2019s and the EU\u2019s best interests and he has said he will be energetic in pursuit of a deal. \u201cWe very much want a deal but we\u2019re also clear about what needs to be achieved in order to secure that.\u201d The spokesman added: \u201cHe has held a number of conversations with EU leaders, so has the prime minister\u2019s sherpa David Frost.

As the field winnows, Democrats need to have a foreign policy-focused debate to show what would differentiate the major contenders; all we have to<strong> </strong>guess from<strong> </strong>right now are the candidates\u2019 voting records, speeches and campaign hires.</p> <p>I would split the five frontrunners into three camps:<strong> </strong>liberal internationalist hawks (former vice-president Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris), Obama-redux (Mayor Pete Buttigieg), and progressives (Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren).</p> <p>Biden\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/why-bidens-long-foreign-policy-record-could-be-a-liability\">long record</a> includes voting for the Iraq war in 2008.

Biden\u2019s speech hit on a few <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/7/11/20690243/joe-biden-foreign-policy-speech-new-york-trump\">fairly conventional themes</a> about the need to \u201creassert American leadership\u201d, the need to return to American values, and the importance of allies in the face of a rising China.

His foreign policy speech emphasized a technology-driven imagining of what America needs to be in <a href=\"https://peteforamerica.com/national-security-for-a-new-era/\">2054</a>, while maintaining a slimmed-down American exceptionalism.

He also suggested reviving Obama-era accords that Trump has unilaterally discarded.</p> <p>As a senator, Warren has mostly focused on finance, which was reflected in a speech she gave at American University last year.
