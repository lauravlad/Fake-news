Before the introduction of the national living wage (in 2016), over one in five workers across Britain (20.7%, or 5.5 million workers in total) were in low-paid work, a figure which has now fallen to 17.1 per cent (or 4.7 million workers).

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Around 4m people will benefit from the two aspects of the policy, according to Treasury sources.</strong> It is estimated that on average the increase will be worth \u00a34,000 a year to those affected by the time it comes into force.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The national living wage is currently set at \u00a38.21 an hour. </strong>This is equivalent to 60% of median earnings. Sajid Javid\u2019s plan is to raise this to 66% of median earnings by 2024, which is forecast to take it to \u00a310.50 an hour. Without the increase from 60% to 66%, the forecast would be for the national living wage to be worth \u00a39.55 by 2024.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Javid also plans to lower the age limit at which people can get the national living wage, a policy introduced by George Osborne when he was chancellor.</strong> The national living wage was a beefed-up minimum wage for people aged 25 and over. Younger worker were kept on the minimum wage, which is currently \u00a37.70 for over-21s and \u00a36.15 for over-18s. The national living wage is not the same as<a href=\"https://www.livingwage.org.uk/what-real-living-wage\"> the Living Wage Foundation\u2019s living wage</a>, a voluntary rage for employers committed to decent pay, set at \u00a310.55 an hour in London and \u00a39 an hour outside London.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Javid will reduce the age limit for the national living wage in two stages. </strong>From 2021 it will go down to 23, so that people aged 23 and over get it. By 2024 it will go down to 21, so that people aged 21 and over qualify. This will require changes to secondary legislation.

He also said the government would be spending an extra \u00a3120m to set up institutes of technology in 20 cities.</p> \n  <p>To anyone familiar with debates about education policy, this will be familiar; politicians have been saying things like this for years. In fact, the first speech I ever covered by a politician, when I was a trainee reporter on the South Wales Echo in 1990, involved Peter Walker, the then Welsh secretary, speaking about how Britain needed to copy Germany\u2019s expertise in vocational and technical educational. Walker\u2019s speech (which was much better than Williamson\u2019s) made the point that Germany had been a pioneer in this field since the late 19th century. Good luck to Williamson if he wants the UK to catch up within the next decade, but it might not be straightforward.</p> \n  <p><em>UPDATE:</em> This is from <strong>Sam Freedman</strong>, a policy adviser at the Department for Education when Michael Gove was education secretary.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Samfr/status/1178626773707366401\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In a crowded field this is the most meaningless announcement I've ever heard from an education secretary.

He argues that a no-deal Brexit would be an unusual economic shock because as well as restricting demand (which supports the case for a rate cut), it may restrict supply too (which could strengthen the case for a rate rise). <strong>Chris Giles,</strong> the FT\u2019s economics editor, thinks the bank will not be happy with what Javid said.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisGiles_/status/1178571526762827777\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Javid\u2019s suggestion that BoE will act to stimulate the economy after a no deal Brexit is:<br><br>a) true<br>b) likely to go down like a bucket of cold sick in BoE, which has studiously said rates could go in either direction</p>\u2014 Chris Giles (@ChrisGiles_) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisGiles_/status/1178571526762827777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 30, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Javid implied the government has a plan to bypass the Benn Act, which is designed to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal on 31 October.</strong> Today\u2019s Nick Robinson said he did not expect Javid to tell him how the government might get round this, because the prime minister himself has refused to answer this question.

Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s main events: The prime minister came under increasing pressure over allegations of sexual impropriety. Boris Johnson\u2019s former cabinet colleague, Justine Greening, described the claims as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and current ministers, including Johnson, spent much of the day fending off questions on the subject. The Tories will aim to raise the \u201cnational living wage\u201d to \u00a310.50 an hour, the chancellor said. Sajid Javid announced the aspiration during his conference speech on Monday. Labour attacked it as a \u201cpathetic attempt at catch-up\u201d, while the Federation of Small Businesses said the plan could make some small businesses unviable. Johnson would be dismissed by the Queen if he ignored a court order to implement the law requiring him to ask for a Brexit delay, it was claimed. Dominic Grieve, one of the MPs involved in drafting the Benn act, said the legislation is robust and that ministers will not find loopholes in it, amid speculation No 10 believes it has found a way through it. If you\u2019d like to read more, my colleagues Rowena Mason, Kate Proctor and Heather Stewart have this: The UK\u2019s proposal for dealing with the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic includes the creation of a series of customs posts either side and a few miles back from the border itself, according to a report by Ireland\u2019s RT\u00c9 News. The outlet says it has seen extracts of documents produced in London and that the proposals also include the idea of monitoring the movement of goods from one \u201ccustoms clearance site\u201d to another using GPS via mobile phone data, or tracking devices placed on trucks or vans. The report, which the Guardian has not independently verified, reads: Under the British proposals, both the UK and EU would create what are believed to be called \u2018customs clearance sites\u2019, but to all intents and purposes a customs post. Traders would have a choice of either a straightforward customs declaration which would have to be lodged and cleared on either side of the border, or the so-called \u2018transit\u2019 system. Under a transit scheme, the exporter becomes a registered \u2018consigner\u2019 at base, and the importer becomes a registered \u2018consignee\u2019. The method requires a bond from a financial institution to guarantee that the relevant customs duty, excise and VAT have been paid and that the goods do not go illegally off the beaten track en route. According to RT\u00c9 News, senior political figures on the island have already dismissed the ideas. At the fringe event, the denunciation of the government by some of its former members goes on: The shadow culture secretary, Labour\u2019s Tom Watston, has welcomed the reversal of the BBC\u2019s decision to partially uphold a complaint against the presenter, Naga Munchetty: This is the right decision. I\u2019m glad the complaint against Naga Munchetty has been overturned. She was right to give her interpretation of Trump\u2019s language based on her experiences as a woman of colour. Calling out racism takes courage. The ruling against her was wrong and I hope the BBC reviews the process that led to it. You can read more on that here: Labour\u2019s plans to secure cheaper medicines for the NHS through a system of \u201cvoluntary and compulsory licensing\u201d would \u201cput lives at risk,\u201d the health secretary has claimed. At Labour\u2019s conference in Brighton last week, Jeremy Corbyn said his government would use a system of voluntary and compulsory licensing to procure cheaper versions of patented drugs. Corbyn said Labour would \u201ctell the drugs companies that if they want public research funding then they\u2019ll have to make their drugs affordable for all\u201d. He also announced plans in the longer term to create a publicly-owned generic drugs manufacturer to lower prices for the NHS and fund \u201csocially valuable and challenging\u201d research into antimicrobial resistance which is less profitable for pharmaceutical companies. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said Labour\u2019s plans amounted to the nationalisation of parts of the pharmaceutical industry. I think that the announcement to essentially nationalise parts of the drugs supply would ultimately lead to fewer drugs being available and less innovation and that ultimately would not only damage our life sciences industry and the economic damage that comes with that but I think it would put lives at risk. Hancock said intellectual property - such as that for the creation of new medicines - is the \u201cproperty right of the 21st century\u201d and undermining it risks \u201cundermining industry\u201d. A veteran of Boris Johnson\u2019s political campaigns has resigned as a Downing Street political adviser as tensions rise between former Vote Leave members and ex-City Hall factions around No 10. Alex Crowley, who worked on Johnson\u2019s Tory leadership campaign, two mayoral campaigns and wrote a book about him, quit last week. His exit came as several sources with knowledge of No 10 suggested that there was an atmosphere of feuding inside Johnson\u2019s administration. The former justice secretary, David Gauke, has been saying that \u2013 while he is himself a Eurosceptic \u2013 he fears a no-deal Brexit and that the UK\u2019s approach has been fundamentally wrong: Here\u2019s a little more on that fringe event, where the former minister Alistair Burt has been telling an audience he does not need lessons on loyalty to the Tory party. Burt, along with Dominic Grieve and David Gauke, who are also appearing, had the whip withdrawn after voting against the government earlier this month. The Guardian has just published a leader on Labour\u2019s universal credit policy, concluding that the \u201cplan makes sense\u201d. The shocking failings of universal credit are justly blamed on the government having listened to the wrong people when setting it up. The sensible reforms set out by Labour show that the opposition has been listening to the right ones. Never mind that the package of changes announced by Jeremy Corbyn on Saturday was misleadingly described as a plan to \u201cscrap\u201d universal credit. His party\u2019s proposals to end the five-week wait for initial payments, scrap the benefit cap and two-child limit (and heinous \u201crape clause\u201d) are sound. So are promises to review the sanctions system, ditch the \u201cdigital only\u201d approach and hire 5,000 new advisers to help those who struggle with online applications. The army\u2019s zero-tolerance drugs policy has been scrapped less than a year after it was introduced, the defence secretary has confirmed. Speaking at a ConservativeHome fringe event at the Conservative party conference in Manchester, Ben Wallace told Tory members he had changed the policy because it should be for commanding officers, and not the government, to decide to strip an individual of their job. Wallace\u2019s predecessor, Gavin Williamson, brought in the policy in November 2018 in an effort to ensure high standards are maintained. Williamson said drug-taking was incompatible with the armed forces, and that a zero-tolerance approach was the only way to ensure excellence was maintained across the UK\u2019s world-class military. But Wallace has suggested young officers who mistakenly took drugs should be offered a second chance. I changed it. I took the view that some people are young and irresponsible and it should be up to their commanding officers to decide, whether it\u2019s a young lad or girl who\u2019s made a mistake, whether they should be allowed to remain in the armed forces or not. And people who have left and want to rejoin, the same should apply to them as well. I think, you know, that doesn\u2019t mean to say you should be able to do drugs in the armed forces. When pushed on what limits would be imposed, Wallace added that individuals should be allowed to remain in the army \u201cif it is appropriate\u201d. He said: It should be up to commanding officers to understand their workforce, to understand whether that individual is the problem, or if there\u2019s a medical problem and they think they need help, or whether indeed it was a mistake. Some of the 21 MPs to have had the Conservative whip withdrawn earlier this month are holding an event on the fringes of Tory party conference: Signs have emerged that the hardline position of the Conservative party\u2019s most Eurosceptic backbenchers has softened just days before Boris Johnson\u2019s team are due to enter a \u201ctunnel\u201d of secret negotiations with Brussels. Mark Francois, the deputy chair of the European Research Group, has opened the door to a potential Brexit deal, indicating he would look at one even if it included a version of the controversial Irish border backstop to which the Eurosceptic ERG was once implacably opposed. During a heated and sometimes bad-tempered event on the party conference fringe, he indicated that the so-called \u201cSpartan\u201d wing of the party was in the mood for a deal. Referring to the bloc of 28 backbenchers who voted against Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal three times, he said: It has been sometimes been said that we will vote against anything regardless. That\u2019s not true. If there is some form of deal, be it over the backstop or anything else, then I and my colleagues will look at it and read it very carefully, because at the end of the day you are talking about international treaty law. So I\u2019ll look at a deal if there is one. An anti-abortion billboard targeted at the Labour MP Stella Creasy, who is pregnant, has been removed amid claims the campaign amounted to harassment. The owner of the billboard, the advertising agency Clear Channel, apologised and said it was taking immediate action to remove them. The Walthamstow MP said she was being targeted by the anti-abortion group, CBRUK, because she is pro-choice. She posted an image of the billboard online, asking the agency how much they had been paid for hosting it. Later that day, the billboard appeared to have been painted over. Creasy has asked the company to donate the fee made from the billboard to an abortion support charity. She also criticised the Met police\u2019s refusal to intervene. Clear Channel wrote online: A spokesman for the Advertising Standards Agency said: Clear Channel have taken the decision to remove the ad. Therefore we will not be taking any further action at this point. This is from my colleague Graeme Wearden on the UQ in the Commons this afternoon on the Brexit and currency speculation. The UK government has refused to launch an inquiry into its links to financial speculators who are accused of shorting UK assets to profit from a disorderly departure from the EU. Treasury minister Simon Clarke has tried to rebut claims, from former chancellor Philip Hammond, that Boris Johnson\u2019s hedge fund backers would win \u201cbillions of pounds\u201d from a no-deal Brexit. But several MPs have warned that Boris Johnson faces a conflict of interest, having taken money from investors who have shorted UK companies and could be speculating heavily against the pound. Answering an urgent question on Hammond\u2019s allegations, Clarke claimed that such theories were \u201cmore fit for the tin-foil-hat brigade\u201d. He insisted that the pound should be free to float, and accused critics of \u201cselling this country short\u201d. Claims that investors who backed Johnson, or the leave campaign, would win billions from the collapse of sterling were simply wrong, Clarke insisted. And he told several MPs that the best way to avoid a no-deal Brexit was to support efforts to leave with a good deal. But opposition MPs fear that City speculators are hoping to profit from a disorderly Brexit - as the Treasury\u2019s former top civil servant, Nick Macpherson, has warned. Labour\u2019s Tracey Brabin said it was simply immoral for speculators to profit from the pain and disruption that a no-deal Brexit would cause. There is more on Graeme\u2019s business live blog. That is all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has said that if the Tories deliver Brexit by 31 October, the threat from the Brexit party will vanish. At the \u201cStand up for Brexit\u201d fringe he said: If we deliver Brexit on 31 October then [the Brexit party\u2019s] job is done. If we don\u2019t do what we must do by 31 October, then they will be a real force threatening us. So there is no deal to be done, there is delivery to be done. If we deliver, we win and if we don\u2019t, we lose. And it\u2019s as simple as that and if you don\u2019t believe me the person who puts this most clearly is the great Dominic Cummings, to whom we should all be enormously grateful. At the same meeting Steve Baker, chair of the European Research Group, said the Brexit party had one goal and that was to take the UK out of the European Union. He went on: There are many, many good Conservatives in the Brexit party. There\u2019s even a Rees-Mogg [Annunziata, Jacob\u2019s sister, an MEP]. Richard Tice [now MEP for the east of England] was on the candidate list for us and could easily have been our mayoral candidate in London. There are some really, really excellent Conservatives in the Brexit party and I just want them to come home. Asked about the prospects for a deal with the EU, Rees-Mogg said: I think it can be won if the deal that is brought back is, as anticipated, considerably better than the one that we had before, with the question of the Irish backstop dealt with. And if the DUP are persuaded and if Steve is persuaded, then I think we are very, very close to a majority in parliament. I think if we get the deal we will get the majority in parliament, partly because I think we are all fed up of this. And here is some business reaction to the national living wage announcement. From Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general Business shares the chancellor\u2019s ambition to end low pay. Increasing productivity is the only way to sustainable pay rises. The success of the independent low pay commission has been its evidence-based approach to increasing wages without damaging job prospects. The commission will work best if it retains the ability to judge the pace and affordability of any future wage rises. From Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce The government\u2019s ambition to raise and simplify the national living wage is laudable but the path to doing so must be on the basis of clear economic evidence, with ample time for businesses to adjust to any changes. Companies already face significant cumulative employment costs, including pensions auto-enrolment, immigration skills charge and the apprenticeship levy, so government must take action to alleviate the heavy cost-burden facing firms, or risk denting productivity and competitiveness. These are from Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, on the national living wage announcement. These are from Sky\u2019s Sam Coates. The Federation of Small Businesses has said that Sajid Javid\u2019s national living wage increase could put some small firms out of business. Its national chairman, Mike Cherry, said in a statement: While it is welcome that the chancellor is giving businesses five years to adapt, this increase will leave many small employers struggling and, without help, could make some small firms unviable. Those in sectors with tight margins and which are heavily labour-dependent, such as the care sector, retail or hospitality, will be particularly badly hit without support. Four in ten small employers say operating costs are rising due to employment costs. The chancellor must now find ways to help those smaller businesses to meet his ambition, without deterring them from expanding and hiring more employees. We are suggesting to the government that it should uprate the Employment Allowance introduced by George Osborne to bring down the costs of employment, together with a national Insurance holiday for those that recruit those furthest from work \u2013 as promised in the 2017 Conservative manifesto. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston And here is Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, on the national living wage announcement. The TUC has long campaigned for a minimum wage of over \u00a310, and an end to the discrimination young workers suffer from lower rates. But the chancellor\u2019s pre-election promise should be taken with a huge bucket of salt. This pledge would be overwhelmed by a no-deal Brexit. If we leave the EU without a deal, jobs will be lost, wages will fall, and our public services will suffer. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has dismissed Sajid Javid\u2019s national living wage announcement as a \u201cpathetic attempt at catch-up\u201d. He explained: This pathetic attempt at catch-up by the Conservatives will fool nobody. Labour will introduce \u00a310 as a minimum as soon as we take office and, rising with living costs, it will mean everybody over 16 years of age will be earning comfortably more than \u00a310.50 an hour by 2024. Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto promised a real living wage of at least \u00a310 an hour for all workers over 16 by 2020. The party says, based on the expected inflation rate, by 2024 that would be worth \u00a310.81. The Resolution Foundation, a thinktank specialising in low pay, has welcomed Sajid Javid\u2019s plan to increase the value of the national living wage and widen its scope. Here is an extract from its news release. The chancellor\u2019s plan to eliminate low pay over the next five years \u2013 by raising the national living wage (NLW) to reach two-thirds of typical hourly pay \u2013 is hugely ambitious and will need to be implemented carefully, the Resolution Foundation said today ... The foundation says that achieving this would mark a dramatic turnaround for Britain\u2019s low pay landscape. Before the introduction of the national living wage (in 2016), over one in five workers across Britain (20.7%, or 5.5 million workers in total) were in low-paid work, a figure which has now fallen to 17.1 per cent (or 4.7 million workers). Aiming to abolish low pay entirely represents a significant increase in ambition. Raising the NLW to \u00a310.50 in 2024 would see a worker (aged 25+) on the wage floor earn around 70p an hour more than they would have done if the previous plans for the NLW had been maintained \u2013 equivalent to an extra \u00a31,400 a year for a full-time worker. The \u00a31.400 a year average gain quoted by the Resolution Foundation is considerably less than the \u00a34,000 a year average gain quoted by Treasury sources (see 4.23pm), but that figure included those gaining because the age at which the national living wage is paid is coming down from 25 to 21. Mark Francois, the deputy chair of the European Research Group, the Tory caucus pushing for a harder Brexit, has opened the door to a potential vote in favour of a deal that could include an Irish border backstop. Francois said during a heated debate on the future of Brexit that the ERG would be the first to sign off a deal if it meant a genuine exit from all the institutions of the EU. He said: It has been sometimes been said that we will vote against anything regardless. That\u2019s not true. If there is some form of deal, be it over the backstop or anything else, then I and my colleagues will look at it and read it very carefully because at the end of the day you are talking about international treaty law. I\u2019ll look at a deal if there is one, but as I think I said my acid test will be, does it mean we genuinely leave the EU? I want nothing more than to see the sun rise on the 1 November on a free country. Explaining the conditions under which he would consider supporting deal, Francois said: It rather depends what\u2019s in it. As a so-called Spartan, if it means we genuinely leave the EU, if it means we genuinely leave on Halloween, I will be the first in the Aye lobby. But if it did not mean that, then he would vote against it, Francois said, \u201cand no amount of brow beating will make me change my mind.\u201d In Manchester officials have been briefing on the chancellor\u2019s plans to increase the value of the national living wage. Here are the main points. Around 4m people will benefit from the two aspects of the policy, according to Treasury sources. It is estimated that on average the increase will be worth \u00a34,000 a year to those affected by the time it comes into force. The national living wage is currently set at \u00a38.21 an hour. This is equivalent to 60% of median earnings. Sajid Javid\u2019s plan is to raise this to 66% of median earnings by 2024, which is forecast to take it to \u00a310.50 an hour. Without the increase from 60% to 66%, the forecast would be for the national living wage to be worth \u00a39.55 by 2024. Javid also plans to lower the age limit at which people can get the national living wage, a policy introduced by George Osborne when he was chancellor. The national living wage was a beefed-up minimum wage for people aged 25 and over. Younger worker were kept on the minimum wage, which is currently \u00a37.70 for over-21s and \u00a36.15 for over-18s. The national living wage is not the same as the Living Wage Foundation\u2019s living wage, a voluntary rage for employers committed to decent pay, set at \u00a310.55 an hour in London and \u00a39 an hour outside London. Javid will reduce the age limit for the national living wage in two stages. From 2021 it will go down to 23, so that people aged 23 and over get it. By 2024 it will go down to 21, so that people aged 21 and over qualify. This will require changes to secondary legislation. Increasing the national living wage does not require legislation because the low pay commission proposes the rate, in accordance with guidance from government. The Treasury has not produced a figure for how much this will cost employers, or the government, but sources insist that the impact will be relatively minor. They argue that the proposals are balanced, that they are being phased in over time, and that employers understand the case for a higher minimum wage. Javid also says the Tories will lower the age at which people can get the national living wage. At the moment it is paid to people aged 25 and over. And to help the next generation of go-getters to get ahead \u2026 \u2026 we will reward the hard work of all millennials too\u2026 by bringing down the age threshold for the national living wage\u2026 \u2026 to cover all workers over the age of 21. Javid says the Tories will aim to raise the \u201cnational living wage\u201d to \u00a310.50 an hour In 2016, we introduced the national living wage... Giving Britain\u2019s workers the biggest pay rise in two decades. In April, we increased the rate again \u2026 \u2026 making 1.8 million workers better off \u2026 Putting the number of low-paid workers at its lowest level in four decades. Today, I\u2019m delighted to announce that we will take this much further. Over the next five years, we will make the UK one of the first major economies in the world to end low pay altogether. To do that, I am setting a new target for the national living wage: raising it to match two-thirds of median earnings. That means, on current forecasts, this ambitious plan will bring the national living wage up to \u00a310.50. Giving 4 million people a well-earned pay rise. Javid announces a \u00a3500m youth investment fund. This ambitious \u00a3500m programme will roll out youth centres and services right across our country\u2026 \u2026 helping millions more young people get on the conveyor belt to a better life and career. Javid announces a further white paper on devolution. So I can announce today we will bring forward a white paper on further devolution in England. Giving more local areas more local powers\u2026 \u2026 to drive investments in the infrastructure and services they know they need. We already have four brilliant Conservative metro mayors\u2026 Let\u2019s get one in Manchester too! Javid praises Ruth Davidson, the former Tory leader in Scotland. She was one of his biggest supporters, but she has not been mentioned by other ministers on the conference platform. (She resigned partly because she disapproved of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy.) Javid turns to buses - a subject he said this morning had been long neglected by Whitehall. (See 9.18am.) Now buses .... \u2026 they haven\u2019t been given the attention they deserve from politicians\u2026 \u2026 but they are still the backbone of our public transport in most of the country. Well, not only do you have a chancellor with a well-known family connection to buses\u2026 \u2026 but a PM who likes to paint them! At the spending round we allocated \u00a3220m to buses alone. This will form part of a national bus strategy next year. Rolling out new \u2018superbus\u2019 networks\u2026 \u2026 expanding our fleet of low-emission buses\u2026 \u2026 and delivering better value for money for passengers. And last but not least, connecting us to the modern, global digital economy with gigabit broadband. Javid promises an infrastructure revolution. Successive governments failed to invest enough for the long term. We\u2019ve started to put that right, but we can do more, a lot more. This government is going to build Britain\u2019s future, and bring in a new infrastructure revolution. He is confirming the proposals briefed overnight. My colleague Peter Walker wrote them up here. Javid stresses his commitment to public services, saying they will be at the heart of the government\u2019s agenda. For me, like so many others around the country\u2026 \u2026 public services were my lifelines. The teachers who made my career possible. The police officers who kept us safe when the street I grew up on became a centre for drug dealers. The NHS that cared for my dad in his final days. These aren\u2019t just numbers on a spreadsheet - they are the beating heart of our country. That\u2019s why public services are at the heart of this government\u2019s agenda. Javid announces plans for a Brexit red tape challenge. As we look towards a future outside the EU\u2026 \u2026 I\u2019m very optimistic we can build on our extraordinary economic strengths \u2026 \u2026 and reshape the British economy to seize the opportunities that this new chapter has to offer. We\u2019ll be able to pursue a genuinely independent trade policy. We\u2019ll be able to replace inefficient EU programmes with better, home-grown alternatives. And from retail to green tech, we\u2019ll have the opportunity to design smarter, more flexible regulation. To help us do that, I will launch a Brexit red tape challenge\u2026 \u2026 to help identify EU regulations that we can improve or remove. Liberating our entrepreneurs, small businesses and consumers\u2026. \u2026 from the burden of over-bearing bureaucracy, wherever we see it. Doing what a good pro-business government does. Javid says since 2010 the Conservatives have reduced the deficit. We may disagree on our approach on Brexit\u2026 \u2026 but as Conservatives we can be very proud of what they helped us to achieve. Labour left behind a bankrupt Britain - and we\u2019ve fixed it. Javid says Brexit is an opportunity to ask big questions about the future of the country. Jeremy Corbyn sees this as an opportunity to bring in nationalisation, protectionism and state control. Javid says international investors fears Labour more than they fear Brexit. If they [Labour] had their way, whole sectors of the economy would be renationalised. People\u2019s taxes would rise to the crippling levels of the past. People\u2019s jobs would be put at risk with sectoral pay bargaining. The return of trade union militancy would once again hold the government to ransom \u2026 \u2026 wasting hundreds of billions of pounds\u2026 \u2026 and hitting families and businesses around the country. The British Chambers of Commerce said last week that Labour\u2019s plans will \u201csend an icy chill up the spines of business owners and investors\u201d. And it\u2019s no wonder. We have a shadow chancellor who says businesses are \u201cthe real enemy\u201d\u2026 \u2026 and openly admits he wants to overthrow capitalism. Javid says there are millions of people who voted remain but who now just want to see Brexit delivered. He says the risks from not delivering Brexit are greater than the risks from Brexit. People talk a lot about the risks of Brexit. Some understandable, some not. But the truth is this \u2013 and it isn\u2019t acknowledged as often as it should be \u2013 the most reckless course of all would be to not deliver Brexit at all. If we fail to deliver on the instruction of the British people\u2026 \u2026 we are in danger of tearing the very fabric of our democracy. A fabric that has been carefully woven together over centuries. And if we do that, I fear we may not be able to stitch it up again. Javid turns to Labour. They\u2019re so split down the middle\u2026 \u2026 that even their leader and their shadow chancellor don\u2019t agree on whether they support Brexit. So they\u2019ll hold another referendum with two options: perhaps, and maybe. What a leader. A man for the many Brexit positions, not the few. Javid says this is ultimately a question about trust. Democracy is not just for when it suits you, he says. A strong economy can only be built on the foundation of a successful democracy. And by definition, democracy isn\u2019t just for when it suits you. Like the Lib Dems - who called for a referendum for years, then sort of changed their mind, then said they\u2019d respect the result, then sort of didn\u2019t, then called for a second vote, then changed their mind again\u2026 \u2026 and now want to somehow pretend the whole thing never happened. Going back on our promises to the British people isn\u2019t \u201cliberal\u201d, and it certainly isn\u2019t democratic. Javid says, deal or no deal, the UK will be ready. Javid says we are leaving the EU in 31 days - deal or no deal. Preparing to leave without a deal is not only the responsible thing to do, but the best way of getting a deal too. In all his years negotiating multi-million pound deals in the City, he never walked into a room without being able to walk away. That is why he has increased no-deal spending. And he has been able to guaranteed devolved administrations all the \u00a34.3bn of EU funding they were expecting under a deal (which involved a transition period). Sajid Javid is speaking now. He says his mother is here. Twenty years ago she thought it was a big deal when the first Asians moved into Coronation Street. Now she has seen the first Asians move into Downing Street. Once again, they are living above the shop. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is about to deliver his conference speech. From Sky\u2019s Europe correspondent Adam Parsons David Gauke, the former justice secretary and one of the 21 Tories who had the whip removed for rebelling over Brexit, thinks Boris Johnson will get the blame if Brexit is delayed. But Rory Stewart, the former international development secretary and another of the 21 Brexit rebels, thinks Gauke is wrong. Whether Gauke is right or Stewart is right is one of the most important questions in British politics at the moment. It may decide the next election. Back in Westminster the opposition parties have ruled out calling a no confidence vote this week, Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has said. This is from the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard. Like her colleagues, Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, used her conference speech to road test an attack line against Labour. Hers involved quoting what Tim Roache, the GMB general secretary, said about the plan to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2030. She said: We\u2019re working out the path to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. We can do it, and we will help the world to do it. Contrast that to Labour who last week announced net zero by 2030! Total tosh! A perfect example of Labour promising something they can\u2019t deliver and don\u2019t understand. Unusually, I find myself agreeing with the GMB union, who\u2019s spokesman said, this \u2018threatens whole communities, threatens whole jobs \u2026 This means that within a decade people\u2019s petrol cars being confiscated. This will mean families can only take one flight every five years. Net zero carbon emissions by 2030 is utterly unachievable.\u2019 Well said, that man. Here is more from the Bruges Group fringe. These are from my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll. These are from the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford. From HuffPost\u2019s Arj Singh Mary Wakefield, the Spectator journalist who is married to Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s special adviser, has denied being the second woman at the lunch attended by Charlotte Edwardes 20 years ago where the latter alleges she was groped by Johnson. There was a rumour Wakefield was the second woman referred to, but not named, in Edwardes\u2019 Sunday Times column as being groped by the then editor. There are two urgent questions in the Commons today, starting at 2.30pm. (There are no questions today.) My colleague Graeme Wearden will be covering them on his business live blog, but I will flag up the highlights from Graeme\u2019s blog here too. In the conference hall yesterday Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, seemed to get a warmer reception than any of his ministerial colleagues. He has been speaking at a Daily Telegraph fringe event at lunchtime and, as the Telegraph\u2019s Owen Bennett points out, the queue to see him was huge. And here are some of the best lines, from the Telegraph\u2019s Kate Ferguson, my colleague Rowena Mason, the Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom, and PoliticsHome\u2019s Alain Tolhurst. Rees-Mogg defended Boris Johnson\u2019s use of the term \u201csurrender bill\u201d. He stressed that the EU agreeing to a Brexit extension was not inevitable. He defended Johnson\u2019s decision to dismiss Labour MP Paula Sherriff\u2019s question about threats to MPs in the Commons last week as \u201chumbug\u201d. Rees-Mogg said the Fixed-term Parliaments Act was \u201cone of the most stupid\u201d pieces of legislation passed by parliament. He did not deny calling the supreme court ruling a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d. He praised David Gauke, one of the 21 pro-European Tories who had the whip removed after rebelling over Brexit, and said he was sorry Gauke had the whip removed. My colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll is at a Bruges Group fringe. The Bruges Group represents hardline Brexiters, and it seems that the Guardian is not especially popular ... Dominic Grieve, one of the 21 Tories who had the whip removed after rebelling over Brexit and one of the MPs involved in drafting the Benn Act to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, has said he thinks the legislation is robust, and that ministers will not find loopholes in it. In an interview with Sky News, Grieve said that if Boris Johnson tried to ignore the law, the courts could force him to comply. [Johnson] would be taken to court and a writ of mandamus would be issued against him and he would be told, as a matter of law, that he has to write the letter [to the EU requesting a Brexit delay]. The case could go to the supreme court and I suspect the courts could deal with it very quickly. Grieve also said that, if Johnson tried to ignore the courts, ultimately he could be dismissed as prime minister by the Queen. In another interview, asked if he had squeezed the thigh of the journalist Charlotte Edwardes 20 years ago, Boris Johnson replied: No, and I think what the public want to hear is about what we are doing to level up and unite the country. Asked if that meant she had made it up, he replied: I\u2019m just saying what I\u2019ve said. What the public want to hear is what we are doing for them and for the country and the investment in ways of uniting the country. Asked if stories about his personal life were overshadowing the conference, he replied: Not at all. I think what the public want to hear is what we are doing to bring the country together and get on with improving their lives. I think I would make one general comment: I think there is a lot of people who basically want to stop us delivering Brexit on October 31. But I have to tell you we are not going to be deterred from that ambition. We are going to get on and do it, we are going to get us over the line. I think that that is the best thing for the country because it\u2019s been going on a long time now, this row over Brexit. The pharmaceutical industry has already moved 25% of its medicine imports away from Calais to mitigate the risk of bottlenecks in a no-deal scenario, the industry body has revealed. Mike Thompson, the chief executive of the British Pharmaceutical Association, has also criticised the EU for not allowing the industry on both sides of the channel to engage in talks to prevent blockages. \u201cThere has been an enormous focus on what\u2019s going on. Politics is getting in the way,\u201d he told a fringe event at the Tory conference called \u201cThe NHS in a post-Brexit world\u201d. He said the refusal of the EU to engage with the issue of potential medicine shortages in a no-deal Brexit will gone down in history as a mistake. The UK exports 46m finished packs of medicines to the EU compared with 37m imported by the UK. Among the drugs supplied to the continent was a specialist prostate cancer drug manufactured in Macclesfield, he said. Thompson told the conference that the UK buys 12,300 types of drugs a year and there are generally shortages in 52-100 of them. BBC News has just broadcast a clip of Boris Johnson responding to a question about whether he squeezed Charlotte Edwardes\u2019 thigh at a Spectator lunch 20 years ago with a long and rambling reply about his plans to improve bus services. In an interview with ITV\u2019s Joe Pike, Boris Johnson refused to apologise for his comment about money spent on historical child abuse investigations being \u201cspaffed up a wall\u201d. Johnson said it was \u201cvery, very important\u201d that historical child abuse was investigated, in places such as Rotherham. But he said his comment referred to other cases where allegations were unfounded, such as those raised by the man known as \u201cNick\u201d. Good spot from ITV\u2019s Angus Walker: But it wasn\u2019t all Labour-bashing. In his speech, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, also set an ambitious target for education policy over the next decade. He said he wanted England to be better than Germany at technical education within a decade. (Education policy is devolved, so he is just education secretary for England.) I promise to give my all to make technical and vocational education the first choice for anybody \u2026 with the aptitude, desire and interest to pursue it. Apprenticeships, technical and vocational education are just as valuable as university education, and they are just as important to our economy. So, today, I am setting a new ambition: to super-charge further education over the next decade with an aim to overtake Germany in the opportunities we offer to those studying technical routes by 2029. Williamson said he would set up an expert skills and productivity board to help achieve this. He also said the government would be spending an extra \u00a3120m to set up institutes of technology in 20 cities. To anyone familiar with debates about education policy, this will be familiar; politicians have been saying things like this for years. In fact, the first speech I ever covered by a politician, when I was a trainee reporter on the South Wales Echo in 1990, involved Peter Walker, the then Welsh secretary, speaking about how Britain needed to copy Germany\u2019s expertise in vocational and technical educational. Walker\u2019s speech (which was much better than Williamson\u2019s) made the point that Germany had been a pioneer in this field since the late 19th century. Good luck to Williamson if he wants the UK to catch up within the next decade, but it might not be straightforward. UPDATE: This is from Sam Freedman, a policy adviser at the Department for Education when Michael Gove was education secretary. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, used his conference speech, to claim that Labour\u2019s plans to return schools to local authority control would amount to removing \u201cchoice\u201d from parents. He said: I\u2019m not going to let Labour\u2019s ideological zealots tear up years of progress \u2026 made by both New Labour and Conservative governments. Because let\u2019s be clear: abolishing all primary school tests, ending phonics reading tests, scrapping free schools and academies, taking freedom from headteachers, and choice from parents, returning all schools to local authority control, scrapping Ofsted, and making local authorities responsible for inspecting their own schools and even their own local children\u2019s services, this is no plan for the future. This is a recipe for disaster. From the Spectator\u2019s Isabel Hardman: These are from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby, who interviewed Sajid Javid, the chancellor, this morning. In his speech to the conference earlier Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said he loved the NHS because it embodied \u201ctimeless Conservative values\u201d. He said: Now, as you might have heard, I love the NHS. And I think the NHS embodies timeless Conservative values: Patriotism \u2013 because we look out for each other in this country. Global leadership \u2013 because in many ways it\u2019s the finest health service in the world. Public service \u2013 because so many people give so much, day in day out, to care for others. These values are Conservative values, they are British values, and they are the values of the NHS. Sir Nicholas Soames, one of the 21 Tories who had the whip withdrawn after a Brexit rebellion earlier this month, has described the decision to punish those 21 as \u201cabsolutely insane\u201d. On the conference stage Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was asked to name the one thing the Conservatives should be saying on the doorstep about the Tory approach to public services. He replied: With the NHS, the single most important thing, which is so important, is that we show and communicate that we love the NHS. Normally at Tory conferences cabinet ministers have a sprinkling of policy announcements in their speeches. This year most of them have had little or nothing to say on policy. Partly that\u2019s because the overall focus is on \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d, but partly it is because this is a government without a majority, probably just weeks away from an election, which is not really in a position to implement anything. Instead, ministers are using their speeches to rehearse attack lines against Labour. Therese Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, used her speech a moment ago to claim that a Jeremy Corbyn government would penalise pensioners. She was not arguing about the value of state benefits, but instead making an argument about the value of pension funds, and the possible impact on them of policies like Labour\u2019s inclusive ownership funds. (See 10.33am.) She said: Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour will hit pensioners\u2019 saving pots through hiking taxes and renationalising swaths of industry \u2013 costing pensioners thousands of pounds. Unlike Conservatives. Since 2010, we have increased the basic state pension by \u00a31,600 a year. Boris Johnson\u2019s long-standing allies have accused him of shutting them out and only listening to his adviser, the Vote Leave campaign head Dominic Cummings, and to Carrie Symonds, Johnson\u2019s partner, the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn is reporting this morning. Newton Dunn says Lynton Crosby, the Tory election strategist, and Will Walden, Johnson\u2019s communications chief when he was London mayor, feel marginalised. Newton Dunn writes: One former close ally of the PM\u2019s told the Sun: \u201cThe Cummings experiment has palpably failed, but Boris will not turn the ship. \u201cHe\u2019s only listening to two voices now, Dominic and Carrie - and Dominic\u2019s approach is proving a car crash. We\u2019re getting really worried.\u201d Having played a key part in Boris\u2019s leadership campaign, it has also emerged that Mr Walden refused to take up a senior role in No 10 after feeling marginalised, and has returned to his job in PR. In the conference hall Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has just delivered what he said was his first speech to a Tory conference. He spent much of it attacking Labour, saying that its plan to give up to 10% of shares in large companies to an \u201cinclusive ownership fund\u201d controlled by workers would be \u201cthe largest expropriation of assets ever seen in a western democracy\u201d. Sunak said: Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell would fundamentally destroy the free enterprise economy that pays for our nurses, our teachers, our armed forces. Take just one example. Their plan to confiscate 10% of the value of all successful companies. What would happen? Investment would cease, jobs would disappear, pensions savings would be hammered. This \u00a3300bn raid would be the largest expropriation of assets ever seen in a western democracy. I\u2019ve spent my career in business, investing in companies, big and small. I have pored over Labour\u2019s plans in detail and I can tell you, everybody would end up paying the price. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has criticised Sajid Javid for not being able to say how much a no-deal Brexit would cost the economy. (See 8.21am.) McDonnell said: The chancellor refused to say what the real costs of a no-deal Brexit would be, or how it would impact on the economy. He either has no clue or he is being completely disingenuous, because he knows what a disaster no deal would be for everyone except the super rich. Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, will use his conference speech to announce plans to extend the right that housing association tenants have to shared ownership of their homes. In a press statement, the Conservative party says: We will establish a new national model for shared ownership which allows people in new housing association properties to buy a proportion of their home while paying a subsidised rent on the rest \u2013 helping thousands of lower earners step on to the housing ladder. People will be able to buy more of their home in 1% increments, rather than the 10% (or more) chunks currently required. This seems to be mostly a restatement of a plan announced by the housing ministry over the summer. Sajid Javid implied in his Today interview that the government does have a plan to bypass the Benn Act. In a useful Twitter thread at the weekend, the Times\u2019s Raphael Hogarth listed five possible ways in which this could be done - all of which he thinks are flawed. Here are the main points from Sajid Javid\u2019s Today interview. The chancellor signalled he has a plan to cut taxes or boost spending to protect the economy in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He said: I\u2019m also clear that, if it was no deal, there would be a significant economic policy response. You have the independent Bank of England that will almost certainly think about a monetary policy response, and that\u2019s for them. But I will be thinking about a fiscal, and other economic policy, response. Javid said he would be saying more about this in his conference speech this afternoon. His comment about the Bank of England implies that it would cut interest rates in the event of a no-deal Brexit. This is a fair assumption. Mark Carney, the bank\u2019s governor, told MPs recently that he was more likely than not to cut rates in the event of no deal, but he has also said that this is not a certainty. He argues that a no-deal Brexit would be an unusual economic shock because as well as restricting demand (which supports the case for a rate cut), it may restrict supply too (which could strengthen the case for a rate rise). Chris Giles, the FT\u2019s economics editor, thinks the bank will not be happy with what Javid said. Javid implied the government has a plan to bypass the Benn Act, which is designed to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Today\u2019s Nick Robinson said he did not expect Javid to tell him how the government might get round this, because the prime minister himself has refused to answer this question. But Robinson asked if Javid knew what the government\u2019s plan was to sidestep the act. Javid replied: I think I do. Javid said he did not want to give details, but he said the government would obey the law. Asked if he was really telling the financial markets the UK would definitely be leaving on 31 October in all circumstances, Javid replied: Yes, we\u2019ve been very clear, and we could not be clearer. What investors, businesses and others want to know is that you are going to end this uncertainty. We\u2019ve had delay after delay after delay. Businesses want to see an end to the uncertainty. And the way we do that is leave. Javid dismissed EU complaints that the UK has failed to table firm plans to replace the backstop as a negotiating tactic. When asked about their demands for a plan from the UK, he replied: Whether it\u2019s Michel Barnier or others involved in the EU side, they will say all sorts of things. It is part of a negotiating strategy. Javid said politicians had not taken bus services seriously enough. He said: For most of the country, especially when you get out of our capital city, the main public transport people rely on is buses. And I think politicians just haven\u2019t taken [them] seriously enough. Javid\u2019s father was a bus driver. Javid said Boris Johnson had assured him personally that the groping allegation against him was not true. He said: If you are referring to these allegations of a personal nature that were made a couple of days ago, I\u2019ve talked to the prime minister about that. First of all, he could not be clearer \u2013 absolutely clear that they are completely untrue. And I totally trust him on that. Javid referred to allegations \u201cmade a couple of days ago\u201d, but he appeared to be talking about the groping story, which was in yesterday\u2019s Sunday Times. Johnson is also facing allegations about his relationship with Jennifer Arcuri, but in this case he is not denying allegations \u2013 just saying he did nothing wrong, and refusing to comment on his personal life. Javid said he thought the Conservatives would launch an inquiry into Islamophobia in the party in due course. Q: What has happened to the Tory inquiry into Islamophobia in the party? Javid says it will happen. Q: At a fringe meeting last night some people questioned whether Islamophobia even exists. Javid says he does not know about that. He says he prefers to call this anti-Islam hate crime. When people talk about Islamophobia, they think it is about stopping people attacking a religion. He can see why people should be allowed to attack a religion. It is attacking people he finds objectionable, he says. Q: Should the PM set a lead? Should his behaviour be better than other people\u2019s? Javid says the PM is taking a lead. People want to get Brexit done. Johnson is taking a lead on that. Q: Yesterday a No 10 spokesman accused Tory MPs of foreign collusion. Is the government really behaving properly? Javid says the government should behave properly at all times. We have seen inappropriate language across parliament. [The shadow chancellor] John McDonnell has talked about MPs being lynched. And that\u2019s it. I will post a summary soon. Javid says he has spoken to Johnson about the groping allegation. Johnson denies it. Javid says he trusts him. He says he does not get involved when people make allegations like this. Q: Your plan for buses involves spending just \u00a330m. That will make just a dent on the spending lost over the last decade. Javid says the total spending being announced is worth \u00a3220m. He says, outside London, buses are the main public transport people rely on. Politicians have not paid enough attention to them. He wants contactless payment and joined-up services. Q: When Jeremy Corbyn raised it at PMQs, Tory MPs laughed. Does he deserve an apology? Javid says he cannot remember the context. Perhaps people made a point about Corbyn avoiding the topic of Brexit. Q: What would the cost to the UK be of leaving the UK without a deal? Javid says it is hard to know. Q: The OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility] reckons it would cost \u00a330bn a year. Javid says the Treasury is making plans for how to manage this. He says he hopes the government would be able to deal with many of those disruptuions. He says, if there was no deal, that would be a \u201csignificant economic policy response\u201d. He will say more in his speech, he says. He would respond in fiscal and other terms. Javid signals he has plan to cut taxes or increase spending in event of no-deal Brexit. Q: Are the EU going to get formal proposals from the UK this week? Javid says the EU complaints are just part of a negotiating strategy. He says a few weeks ago the EU were saying they would not change the withdrawal agreement. Now they are open to that. Q: Most ministers think the chance of a deal is less than 20%. Do you agree? Javid says he won\u2019t put a figure on it. Nick Robinson is interviewing Sajid Javid. Robinson talks about the long-term consequences of a no-deal Brexit. And he plays this clip of Boris Johnson speaking last night. Q: Ministers say we are leaving on 31 October. But there is a law saying that cannot happen if there is no deal. Can the UK leave without a deal on 31 october. Yes, says Javid. He says the government would prefer a deal. Q: Do you know how the government will get around this law? I don\u2019t expect you to tell me how. Javid replies: I think I do. He says he does not want to discuss the detail. But he says the government will obey the law. Javid suggests government has plan to bypass Benn Act outlawing no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Q: I know you won\u2019t tell me how you will get round this law. But is this talk just bravado, or are you telling the markets we will definitely be out on 31 October. Javid says the UK will leave. It wants a deal, but is prepared to leave without one. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is addressing the Conservative conference in Manchester this afternoon and, as is usual, the party has previewed his speech with an overnight policy announcement. It is about infrastructure spending. But it has failed to grip the news agenda. Partly that\u2019s because the government is now far short of having a majority, so anything big announced at this conference is basically an election pledge, not a statement of intent by a party in power. And partly it\u2019s because large elements of what was in the overnight press notice have been announced before. And mostly, of course, it is because before Javid can even mention the word infrastructure in the interviews he is doing this morning, he is finding himself fending off questions about Boris Johnson\u2019s behaviour towards women. This is what Javid told BBC News about the allegation that Johnson groped a journalist at a Spectator lunch when he was editing the magazine. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to get drawn into personal allegations. For my part, I\u2019m not going to get into that. The prime minister has said that this is completely untrue. I have full faith in the prime minister, I don\u2019t doubt what he has said for a second but I\u2019m not going to get drawn into these allegations. But Justine Greening, the former Tory cabinet minister, who now sits as an independent having lost the whip as one of the 21 Brexit rebels, gave a very different assessment on the Today programme. She said: I can\u2019t comment on those accusations, but they are deeply concerning and in a sense they go to the heart of this question about character and integrity of people in public life and what standards the electorate have a right to expect. Javid will be on Today at 8.10am. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, Therese Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, and Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, speak in a session at the Tory conference on public services. 10.45am: Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, speaks. 11.20am: Jake Berry, the northern powerhouse minister, Esther McVey, the housing minister, and Nadim Zahawi, a business minister, speak at a session on \u201clevelling up\u201d. 2pm: Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, Theresa Villiers, the environment secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, the business minister, and Zac Goldsmith, the environment minister, speak in a session on the economy. 2.30pm: The Commons sits. MPs will hold debates on the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act. 2.55pm: Sajid Javid, the chancellor, speaks. 3.15pm: Nicky Morgan, the culture minister, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, and Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, speak in a session on infrastructure. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing almost exclusively on the Conservative conference. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all.

The statement, drawn up during a meeting at the Speaker\u2019s House in parliament on Monday, was signed by Mark Spencer, the government chief whip \u2013 most government ministers are in Manchester for the Conservative conference \u2013 and Jeremy Corbyn. The other signatories were the Scottish National party\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford; the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson; the Democratic Unionist party\u2019s Nigel Dodds; the Green MP Caroline Lucas; the Independent Group for Change leader, Anna Soubry; Plaid Cymru\u2019s Liz Saville Roberts; and the Speaker, John Bercow. \u201cWe all accept that we have a responsibility to try to use moderate language,\u201d the statement begin. \u201cWe all feel that those in leadership positions have a particular duty to weigh their words carefully, bearing in mind that there are stark divisions across the country on Brexit. \u201cThe right of a member to personal safety is absolute and unconditional. Everyone is entitled to have a view \u2013 be they parliamentarian, journalist or a member of the public \u2013 and their right to safety cannot in any way be dependent on what that view is or the course of political action they take.\u201d The gathering was instigated following anger and upset in the Commons last week, when there was repeated criticism of Boris Johnson for terms such as \u201csurrender bill\u201d to describe a backbench-instigated law seeking to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The most vehement anger came on Wednesday last week, when Johnson described as \u201chumbug\u201d worries expressed by Labour\u2019s Paula Sherriff about threats to MPs by people using the same language as the prime minister, and her fears of a repeat of the 2016 murder of fellow Labour MP Jo Cox by a far-right terrorist. Johnson was also condemned for arguing in the same debate that the best way to honour Cox \u2013 who campaigned vigorously for remain \u2013 would be to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. The prime minister repeatedly refused to apologise, saying only that his use of \u201chumbug\u201d referred to people arguing against the use of the term surrender, and that he was \u201csorry for the misunderstanding\u201d. Speaking after the meeting, Corbyn said he had requested the gathering following Johnson\u2019s comments \u201cand the appalling language he used, particularly in respect of Paula Sheriff\u2019s comments over the death of Jo Cox\u201d. Corbyn said: \u201cThe Speaker has since drafted up a statement on behalf of us, which is to say: tone down the rhetoric, tone down the language. \u201c\u2018Yes, political debate.

      "body": "<p>Your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/27/the-guardian-view-on-brexit-divisions-a-week-that-reset-the-dial\" title=\"\">editorial</a> (28 September) claimed that the prime minister has been pursuing a three-phase strategy, the implication of which is that he actually hoped to bounce the EU into a deal and subsequently win an election, which would give him a majority in parliament. I don\u2019t find this plausible.</p> <p>Nothing is more likely than that Boris Johnson is a fully paid-up member of the extreme libertarian tendency which has long hoped to destroy the influence of the EU in British policy, thus freeing up Conservative governments to move towards a US-style polity with low taxes, minimal social security and weak protections for workers.</p> <p>For this to be possible it is, of course, necessary to exit the jurisdiction of the European court. Nothing else matters: for the kind of people Johnson is working for, the chaos resulting from a no-deal Brexit is an opportunity to make still more money by selling organisations short and buying ailing firms cheaply, a process that is already happening, whereas any kind of deal would only be the start of years of negotiation with the EU \u2013 Marina Hyde\u2019s charmingly termed \u201cfuckery-pokery\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/27/tories-dominic-cummings-people-v-parliament-election\" title=\"\">Tories beware: an angry mob could end up angry with you</a>, 28 September).</p> <p>It seems very likely, therefore, that the prime minister has aimed for a no-deal Brexit from the start (meaning that the chaos starts, and the jurisdiction of the European court of justice ends, immediately).</p> <p>His problem is then to ensure a Conservative government, as Labour would not facilitate the bonfire of liberties the masters of the universe intend.

      "bodyText": "Your editorial (28 September) claimed that the prime minister has been pursuing a three-phase strategy, the implication of which is that he actually hoped to bounce the EU into a deal and subsequently win an election, which would give him a majority in parliament. I don\u2019t find this plausible. Nothing is more likely than that Boris Johnson is a fully paid-up member of the extreme libertarian tendency which has long hoped to destroy the influence of the EU in British policy, thus freeing up Conservative governments to move towards a US-style polity with low taxes, minimal social security and weak protections for workers. For this to be possible it is, of course, necessary to exit the jurisdiction of the European court. Nothing else matters: for the kind of people Johnson is working for, the chaos resulting from a no-deal Brexit is an opportunity to make still more money by selling organisations short and buying ailing firms cheaply, a process that is already happening, whereas any kind of deal would only be the start of years of negotiation with the EU \u2013 Marina Hyde\u2019s charmingly termed \u201cfuckery-pokery\u201d (Tories beware: an angry mob could end up angry with you, 28 September). It seems very likely, therefore, that the prime minister has aimed for a no-deal Brexit from the start (meaning that the chaos starts, and the jurisdiction of the European court of justice ends, immediately). His problem is then to ensure a Conservative government, as Labour would not facilitate the bonfire of liberties the masters of the universe intend. He obviously thinks (probably rightly) that firing up popular resentment of the elite is the best way to do this; hence the \u201csurrender bill\u201d and all the other incitements, which are also a cemented-in element of the strategy. We can expect an even more unrestricted race to the bottom as the election approaches. So far the pro-EU side does not seem to have any answers to this. As your editorial concludes, let\u2019s hope they act wisely. Whatever that means.
