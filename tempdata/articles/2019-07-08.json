      "bodyText": "Labour is poised to declare it will campaign for remain in a second referendum on any deal put to parliament by a Conservative prime minister, after trade union leaders including Unite\u2019s Len McCluskey backed a change of policy. The joint position agreed by the unions on Monday would not commit Labour to an explicitly pro-remain position in all circumstances: unions also agreed Labour should seek to deliver a Brexit deal if the party won an election before the UK left the EU. That Labour deal would also be put to a public vote, but the party would not commit to campaigning for remain against its own Brexit deal, throwing into doubt what Labour would offer in any snap election manifesto. One senior shadow cabinet source described it as a significant win for remain campaigners, despite the potential lack of clarity. \u201cUnions have backed a referendum on any deal this parliament and Labour campaigning for remain \u2013 that\u2019s a big victory. What\u2019s in a manifesto is a debate for another day,\u201d the source said. Barring any major intervention, the surprise consensus among trade unions including Unite, GMB, Unison, Aslef and Usdaw is likely to force any remaining sceptics to agree to the new position when the shadow cabinet meets on Tuesday. Several shadow cabinet sources said the policy had the hallmarks of being approved by the Labour leader\u2019s office and said it \u201cwould not be watered down\u201d \u2013 though some shadow ministers are likely to push for an even stronger position. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who has regularly clashed with Jeremy Corbyn over the party\u2019s Brexit position, tweeted: \u201cRemain is who we are. Our values are remain, our hearts are remain. Today is a step in the right direction but members and supporters are clear that any kind of Brexit gives us less than we have now and Labour should not support it.\u201d Union leaders had met on Monday to agree a common position on Labour\u2019s Brexit policy, in a meeting one source described as fractious but ultimately consensual. The proposed policy, which will be offered to the Labour leadership as the unanimous view of the unions, will say: Labour will campaign for a second referendum in all circumstances and will campaign for remaining in the EU against a Tory prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal and in order to stop no deal. Should Labour win a general election before Brexit, Labour would negotiate its own Brexit deal and then hold a referendum with remain on the ballot paper \u2013 but the party should not specify whether it would back remain in those circumstances. A senior Labour source said Corbyn had not been present at the meeting but suggested it was a helpful outcome. \u201cJeremy has been working to unite the party and the wider Labour movement around a common position,\u201d the source said. Union sources close to the talks said they did not want the position to be presented as an out-and-out victory for remain campaigners, saying the party would still have a chance to tell leave voters it would honour the result of the 2016 referendum by negotiating a Brexit deal if in government. \u201cUltimately everybody just wants this to end,\u201d one union source said. \u201cIt would be an error to let this drag on until conference and have the battle on the conference floor. But it is right to reserve the position on a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal which could deliver the result of the 2016 referendum. It would be mad to say we would negotiate a deal and then campaign against it.\u201d One union source said the meeting had been lengthy but amicable and its purpose had been to find a consensus. \u201cWe are pleased and confident that everything is on the right road,\u201d the source said. A briefing war has erupted over the past few weeks as some shadow cabinet ministers suggested senior Corbyn aides and union figures such as McCluskey were preventing the party moving to an explicitly pro-remain position or championing the change in party policy. On Sunday, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, denied claims he had been urging Corbyn to sack his two most senior aides, Karie Murphy and Seumas Milne, because they were opposed to Labour committing to backing remain in a second referendum. Labour had already shifted its Brexit stance to propose that any Brexit deal passed by parliament should be put to the people in a second referendum, after the party suffered heavy losses to the pro-remain Liberal Democrats at the local and European elections. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, had previously said publicly she was \u201cbeginning to worry\u201d about party policy not being sufficiently pro-remain. Labour MPs at a private meeting of parliamentarians on Monday night expressed some caution about the new policy. \u201cIt is not exactly the absolute clarity we were hoping for,\u201d one MP said. \u201cIt sounds like we are reserving the right to campaign for remain against our own Brexit deal \u2013 that will just sound ludicrous to voters.\u201d The party came under attack for the policy from both sides of the Brexit divide as the trade union agreement emerged.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson will have to embark on a whistlestop charm offensive meeting EU leaders over the summer to try to secure an emergency Brexit summit in September if he is serious about avoiding no deal, according to Whitehall sources who have been involved in negotiations. The senior sources said Johnson, if he becomes prime minister, would immediately need to pull out the stops over parliament\u2019s summer holiday with a round of diplomacy with senior politicians in Europe. He may even need to consider recalling parliament early if he is to achieve the new deal he claims to want. At the same time, they said, he would need to ramp up preparations for a no-deal Brexit, with small businesses currently complacent about the risks of this outcome. One senior source who has been involved in talks with Brussels said there were signs there could be some willingness to compromise, but Johnson could not afford to wait until a planned summit in October, weeks before the UK is due to leave. Another source \u2013 a political ally of Johnson \u2013 said it would need to be established \u201cextremely quickly\u201d over the summer whether there was enough appetite among European leaders for finding a solution that could satisfy both Dublin and London. Johnson\u2019s campaign played down the need for such a course of action, but the Tory hopeful has not yet publicly set out how he hopes to achieve a Brexit deal in his first 100 days in No 10. He has claimed that the chances of a no-deal Brexit are \u201ca million to one\u201d, but his only public strategy so far is to threaten to withhold the \u00a339bn that the UK has agreed to pay the EU in order to secure a new agreement. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, will head to Brussels on Tuesday for meetings with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, to scope out the areas where there might be a willingness to compromise under a new prime minister. Barclay, an early supporter of Johnson for the top job, has repeatedly argued in cabinet in recent weeks that spending on no-deal preparations needed to be increased. Johnson\u2019s team favour leaving the EU on 31 October with some sort of standstill agreement during which a new deal and trading relationship can be negotiated. He would be willing to continue paying into the EU budget during this period. However, this has repeatedly been rejected by Brussels, with the European commission saying Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal is the only one on offer and that there will be no transitional period if there is no deal. Meanwhile, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, is pushing for Conservatives to be given a free vote on a parliamentary move to stop Johnson as prime minister suspending parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit. Hammond is trying to persuade May that she should lift the whip on certain amendments aimed at preventing the House of Commons being denied a say on whether the UK leaves on 31 October without a deal. Dominic Grieve, a Conservative MP and former attorney general, is leading a cross-party effort to prevent a no-deal Brexit with amendments to the Northern Ireland bill, but it is not certain of passing if the government whips against it. Hammond\u2019s best leverage is that he still holds the purse strings as May seeks \u00a327bn of extra education spending as part of her legacy before leaving Downing Street in a fortnight\u2019s time. It is understood that discussions are ongoing over the education spending, and Hammond may be willing to sign off \u00a35bn for the next year, but he believes May\u2019s successor should make the decision about levels of cash for schools after that. The Times reported that he was making spending on education conditional on May allowing a free vote on the prorogation amendments. Grieve, supported by opposition parties and a handful of pro-EU Conservatives, laid an amendment to Northern Ireland legislation on Monday that would stop parliament being prorogued in the autumn to achieve a no-deal Brexit. He told Sky News he hoped to \u201cpersuade my colleagues that I think this bill provides a vehicle by which we can ensure the prorogation of parliament can\u2019t happen\u201d. He said: \u201cI think that the chances of a prime minister carrying out a no-deal Brexit if there is a majority of the House of Commons that doesn\u2019t want it are very slim indeed.
