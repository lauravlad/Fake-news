In a lacerating piece for the Guardian, Rudd dismissed the claims by some Brexit supporters that the UK could strike deals with his country, New Zealand, Canada and India to soften the blow and said the UK risked undermining western values by leaving the EU in a weaker position when it left. \u201cI\u2019m struck, as the British parliament moves towards the endgame on Brexit, with the number of times Australia, Canada, New Zealand and India have been advanced by the Brexiteers in the public debate as magical alternatives to Britain\u2019s current trade and investment relationship with the European Union,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is the nuttiest of the many nutty arguments that have emerged from the Land of Hope and Glory set now masquerading as the authentic standard-bearers of British patriotism. It\u2019s utter bollocks.\u201d Of the prospect of a free trade deal with Delhi, he writes: \u201cAs for India, good luck!\u201d Rudd, a former chair of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, noted that, while Australia, Canada and New Zealand would remain supportive of a post-Brexit UK, their combined population of about 65 million people does not \u201ccome within a bull\u2019s roar of Britain\u2019s adjacent market of 450 million Europeans\u201d. And he cast serious doubt on suggestions the UK could quickly come to a free trade agreement (FTA) with India, pointing out that talks he began with the nation on behalf of Australia a decade ago are still going on. \u201cA substantive India-UK FTA is the ultimate mirage constructed by the Brexiteers. It\u2019s as credible as the ad they plastered on the side of that big red bus about the \u00a3350m Britain was allegedly paying to Brussels each week. Not.\u201d Rudd was writing as the British prime minister, Theresa May, made a last-ditch dash to Strasbourg in an effort to negotiate a form of Brexit she could get past MPs, who have overwhelmingly rejected her approach in the Commons. The government has indicated that it intends to honour its commitment to hold a meaningful vote on her Brexit deal on Tuesday, with less than three weeks remaining before the nation leaves the EU. Rudd, who was Australian prime minister from 2007 to 2010 and again for a short spell in 2013, urged the UK to \u201cuse this critical fortnight to start turning all this around\u201d. He argued that there was a reason to do so \u201cbeyond Britain\u2019s own demonstrable economic self-interest\u201d, claiming that a weaker Europe \u2013 alongside a more inward-looking US \u2013 could only lead to a weakening of the \u201ccontinuing idea of \u2018the west\u2019\u201d. \u201cIf the American pillar is looking a little shaky, Europe is looking even shakier.

      "body": "<p>The signatories to this letter are the chairs of governors of some of the highest-performing state secondary schools in the country. There is a staffing crisis in our schools and we need the government\u2019s help in resolving it. We are united in our deep concern over the threat to our ability to continue to deliver an excellent state education.</p> <p>It is well documented that pay increases for teaching staff have fallen behind the cost of living over recent years. What is less well documented is the human impact of this situation. Our schools depend on the excellence and commitment of our teaching staff to deliver outstanding results. If we do not relieve the pressure on teachers it will be impossible to maintain this performance:</p> <p>\u2022 Ten years ago, we had more applications for teaching posts than we could handle. Now we struggle to fill vacancies, especially in Stem subjects.</p> <p>\u2022 Across the country, teacher training applications have fallen by 5% in the last year, with key targets for science and maths being missed. 40% of teachers in state schools in England leave the system within five years of starting training, rising to 50% for physics and maths.</p> <p>\u2022 Our younger staff cannot afford to live near our schools. These teachers are no longer part of the local community.</p> <p>\u2022 When our teachers want to start families, they have to move to cheaper areas. We lose them at exactly the time when they are most valuable to us.</p> <p>\u2022 We are eliminating vital aspects of a rounded education to protect the teaching budget: cutting mentoring for vulnerable teenagers, because we can\u2019t pay staff for extra duties outside the classroom; dropping the Duke of Edinburgh scheme, potentially making it the preserve of students in private schools; and not providing support for language exchanges.</p> <p>The government\u2019s recently published strategy on teacher recruitment and retention, while containing some laudable elements, fails to address underlying funding issues. Our schools are still just managing to deliver outstanding educational results for our young people, but this will not be the case much longer. The government must stop ducking its responsibilities and must provide the funding that we so desperately need.<br><strong>Janet Pope</strong><em> Chair of governors, Camden School for Girls</em><br><em> </em><strong>Philip Bladen</strong><em> Chair of governors, Lady Margaret School</em><br><em> </em><strong>Fiona Shore</strong><em>, Chair of governors, Watford Grammar School for Girls</em><br><em> </em><strong>Victoria Simmons</strong><em> Chair of governors, The Grey Coat Hospital</em><br><em> </em><strong>Alp Mehmet</strong><em> Chair of governors, Parmiter\u2019s School</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is very true that \u201csixth form colleges have seen funding cut by 21% since 2010\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/mar/08/its-dangerous-full-chaos-of-funding-cuts-in-englands-schools-revealed\" title=\"\">Revealed: the chaos in schools caused by cuts</a>, 9 March) but for further education colleges these funding reductions are just one part of the picture. Adult education funding has also reduced by more than 40%, and now apprenticeship funding for small- and medium-sized businesses is likely to be frozen. Colleges have not received additional funding to cover staff pay awards, unlike schools, and have other costs to bear, including VAT. The work colleges do is essential to post-Brexit Britain, but they must be able to meet the needs of their students and communities. It is to be hoped that the forthcoming spending review does not perpetuate the gross underfunding of post-16 education and instead invests to secure the future prosperity of our country.<br><strong>Dr Alison Birkinshaw</strong><br><em>Principal, York College</em></p> <p>\u2022 As a primary teacher, I too am deeply concerned about underfunding of schools, in particular the effect of austerity measures on those with special needs and mental health conditions. I do, however, take issue with some of the examples in your report.</p> <p>At no time in my career has a headteacher asked me to help clean the school, take the place of a lunchtime supervisor, use my own money to buy resources or don a coat in order to reduce the heating bill. It is the responsibility of the managers of the school to manage the budget and when that budget is inadequate, it is their responsibility to take it up with the government and take the lead in making sure that teachers are left to do what they are best at and paid to do \u2013 teach!</p> <p>It may be well-meaning on the part of teachers to try to ameliorate the lack of funding but it is naive and serves only to exacerbate the problem. Likewise, schools are not forced to ask parents for funding, it is a choice and one that should be avoided. Teachers and parents have to be part of the solution; not the problem.<br><strong>Michelle Webb</strong><br><em>Newsome, West Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Ongoing reports of a crisis in school funding and extremely high levels of teacher stress? Women are massively and disproportionately affected. They constitute <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43386250\" title=\"\">98%</a> of early-years teachers, 85% of primary school teachers and 62% of secondary school teachers. Yet there seemed no mention and even less appetite to deal with this obvious but thriving unfairness, witnessed at the very centre of our domestic and educational culture, on International Women\u2019s Day.<br><strong>Philip </strong><strong>Botterill</strong><br><em>Moseley, Birmingham</em></p> <p>\u2022 No one should be surprised at the state of our schools under this Tory government \u2013 it is all too familiar for anyone who was teaching when Margaret Thatcher and John Major were in office in the 1980s and early 90s. We dodged buckets in the corridors when it rained, cleaned the windows we could reach with floor mops, and got used to any broken windows being glued together because we could not afford replacements.</p> <p>We still have a photograph of our daughter, with her hand in a hole in her primary classroom wall, taken by the local paper to illustrate the state of her school buildings, also falling apart from neglect.</p> <p>School budgets were ruthlessly cut in real terms and capital spending on the school estate absolutely flatlined, until the advent of the Blair Labour government. This Tory government is simply doing what its predecessors did.

      "bodyText": "The signatories to this letter are the chairs of governors of some of the highest-performing state secondary schools in the country. There is a staffing crisis in our schools and we need the government\u2019s help in resolving it. We are united in our deep concern over the threat to our ability to continue to deliver an excellent state education. It is well documented that pay increases for teaching staff have fallen behind the cost of living over recent years. What is less well documented is the human impact of this situation. Our schools depend on the excellence and commitment of our teaching staff to deliver outstanding results. If we do not relieve the pressure on teachers it will be impossible to maintain this performance: \u2022 Ten years ago, we had more applications for teaching posts than we could handle. Now we struggle to fill vacancies, especially in Stem subjects. \u2022 Across the country, teacher training applications have fallen by 5% in the last year, with key targets for science and maths being missed. 40% of teachers in state schools in England leave the system within five years of starting training, rising to 50% for physics and maths. \u2022 Our younger staff cannot afford to live near our schools. These teachers are no longer part of the local community. \u2022 When our teachers want to start families, they have to move to cheaper areas. We lose them at exactly the time when they are most valuable to us. \u2022 We are eliminating vital aspects of a rounded education to protect the teaching budget: cutting mentoring for vulnerable teenagers, because we can\u2019t pay staff for extra duties outside the classroom; dropping the Duke of Edinburgh scheme, potentially making it the preserve of students in private schools; and not providing support for language exchanges. The government\u2019s recently published strategy on teacher recruitment and retention, while containing some laudable elements, fails to address underlying funding issues. Our schools are still just managing to deliver outstanding educational results for our young people, but this will not be the case much longer. The government must stop ducking its responsibilities and must provide the funding that we so desperately need. Janet Pope Chair of governors, Camden School for Girls Philip Bladen Chair of governors, Lady Margaret School Fiona Shore, Chair of governors, Watford Grammar School for Girls Victoria Simmons Chair of governors, The Grey Coat Hospital Alp Mehmet Chair of governors, Parmiter\u2019s School \u2022 It is very true that \u201csixth form colleges have seen funding cut by 21% since 2010\u201d (Revealed: the chaos in schools caused by cuts, 9 March) but for further education colleges these funding reductions are just one part of the picture. Adult education funding has also reduced by more than 40%, and now apprenticeship funding for small- and medium-sized businesses is likely to be frozen. Colleges have not received additional funding to cover staff pay awards, unlike schools, and have other costs to bear, including VAT. The work colleges do is essential to post-Brexit Britain, but they must be able to meet the needs of their students and communities. It is to be hoped that the forthcoming spending review does not perpetuate the gross underfunding of post-16 education and instead invests to secure the future prosperity of our country. Dr Alison Birkinshaw Principal, York College \u2022 As a primary teacher, I too am deeply concerned about underfunding of schools, in particular the effect of austerity measures on those with special needs and mental health conditions. I do, however, take issue with some of the examples in your report. At no time in my career has a headteacher asked me to help clean the school, take the place of a lunchtime supervisor, use my own money to buy resources or don a coat in order to reduce the heating bill. It is the responsibility of the managers of the school to manage the budget and when that budget is inadequate, it is their responsibility to take it up with the government and take the lead in making sure that teachers are left to do what they are best at and paid to do \u2013 teach! It may be well-meaning on the part of teachers to try to ameliorate the lack of funding but it is naive and serves only to exacerbate the problem. Likewise, schools are not forced to ask parents for funding, it is a choice and one that should be avoided. Teachers and parents have to be part of the solution; not the problem. Michelle Webb Newsome, West Yorkshire \u2022 Ongoing reports of a crisis in school funding and extremely high levels of teacher stress? Women are massively and disproportionately affected. They constitute 98% of early-years teachers, 85% of primary school teachers and 62% of secondary school teachers. Yet there seemed no mention and even less appetite to deal with this obvious but thriving unfairness, witnessed at the very centre of our domestic and educational culture, on International Women\u2019s Day. Philip Botterill Moseley, Birmingham \u2022 No one should be surprised at the state of our schools under this Tory government \u2013 it is all too familiar for anyone who was teaching when Margaret Thatcher and John Major were in office in the 1980s and early 90s. We dodged buckets in the corridors when it rained, cleaned the windows we could reach with floor mops, and got used to any broken windows being glued together because we could not afford replacements. We still have a photograph of our daughter, with her hand in a hole in her primary classroom wall, taken by the local paper to illustrate the state of her school buildings, also falling apart from neglect. School budgets were ruthlessly cut in real terms and capital spending on the school estate absolutely flatlined, until the advent of the Blair Labour government. This Tory government is simply doing what its predecessors did. When will we learn?

Barnier, in turn, was said to be indignant about Cox\u2019s interview in the Daily Mail in which he said that he would find a way to allow the UK to unilaterally quit the backstop. The attorney general\u2019s claim that the UK could trigger an arbitration mechanism \u201con the very first day we entered\u201d the backstop was read out to EU ambassadors by an incredulous Barnier. May has a matter of hours to table a motion to parliament in time for a vote on Tuesday. Speaking in the Commons, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said parliament would not tolerate further delay. \u201cTime and time again this prime minister has failed to negotiate, refused to compromise, and delayed and delayed,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter three months the prime minister has not achieved one single change to her deal; she is simply running down the clock.\u201d The junior Brexit minister Robin Walker, who was sent out to answer the urgent question from Corbyn, said the vote would not be withdrawn at the last minute and that the attorney general would publish revised legal advice before the vote. The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, said May or another cabinet minister might give a planned statement on the current state of the negotiations as late as 10pm on Monday night. Walker said that talks with Brussels were at \u201ca critical stage\u201d and were continuing. \u201cThe attorney general\u2019s legal analysis will be updated following the outcome of negotiations,\u201d he said. \u201cHe will be publishing his legal analysis document on any document that is produced and negotiated with the EU before the house meets tomorrow.\u201d The independent MP Anna Soubry said any motion and any amendments MPs would wish to table had to be be put down before the House of Commons rose on Monday night, but Walker would only say that the motion would be published \u201cas soon as it can be\u201d. Bercow said that the House of Commons\u2019 rules required the motion to be published by 10.30pm on Monday night, although indicated he would allow so-called \u201cmanuscript amendments\u201d that are allowed to be tabled by MPs in extreme circumstances on the day of a debate. The prime minister had earlier come under pressure from Eurosceptics to pull the meaningful vote and pass a motion showing Brussels that parliament would approve a deal with a time limit on the backstop. However, Nick Boles, one of the Conservative MPs leading efforts against no deal, said calling off the vote would not satisfy parliament. \u201cI am sure that the prime minister will honour these three commitments. If she doesn\u2019t she will forfeit the confidence of the House of Commons,\u201d he said. Asked whether she would resign, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said there was \u201cnothing to suggest\u201d that outcome, though government sources have suggested they believe May could offer her resignation to hard Brexiters in exchange for voting for her deal. Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper has said she and Conservative MPs would attempt to force votes on an extension of Article 50 on Thursday should the prime minister pull the votes, saying it would be a \u201cstraight-up lie\u201d to parliament if Theresa May changed her plans.",

But if the same person is paid \u00a348.08 a week instead, they will receive \u00a32,500.16 a year, so they will be no better or worse off.</p> <p>Alfie Stirling of the New Economics Foundation said: \u201cThe persistent increases to the personal allowance of income tax seen over the past decade represent one of the most expensive and regressive public spending initiatives of the 21st century so far. Costing more than the whole of defence, local government and the Department for Transport combined and enriching the highest income households almost seven times faster than the poorest.\u201d</p> <p>The leftwing thinktank, which has developed close links with Labour to become a key influencer of shadow Treasury thinking, estimates the current cost of the tax-free allowance is as much as \u00a3111.2bn.</p> <p>It said the change would transfer about \u00a38bn currently spent on tax allowances that benefit the 35% of highest income households to the rest of the country.</p> <p>The policy is likely to face opposition from some voters, as it would also mean bringing down the threshold for higher-rate taxpayers from \u00a350,000 to \u00a337,500. This is because the starting point for 40% income tax moves with the personal allowance. NEF said this would affect the top 13% of earners in the country.</p> <p>McDonnell said: \u201cThis is just the kind of innovative thinking we need on how to fix the imbalances and problems of our tax system.</p> <p>\u201cI hope it will be the start of a debate about how we make tax more progressive and deliver the public services funding that is so badly needed after nine years of austerity.\u201d</p> <p>The richest 10% of households will be \u00a31,470 better off by 2019-20 as a result of changes to the personal allowance since 2010, compared with just \u00a3130 for each of the poorest 10% of households.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Treasury said the personal allowance has removed nearly 2 million people from income tax, and that income inequality in Britain is falling. In a statement, it said: \u201cWe\u2019re raising the personal allowance one year early, which will mean that by April this year, 1.7 million income taxpayers will have been taken out of tax altogether since 2015-16.</p> <p>\u201cOur policies are highly redistributive. In 2019-20, the lowest income households will receive over \u00a34 in public spending for every \u00a31 they pay in tax on average, and the highest income households will contribute over \u00a35 in tax for every \u00a31 they receive in public spending on average.</p> <p>\u201cIncome inequality is lower now than it was in 2010.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 March 2019.

Alfie Stirling of the New Economics Foundation said: \u201cThe persistent increases to the personal allowance of income tax seen over the past decade represent one of the most expensive and regressive public spending initiatives of the 21st century so far. Costing more than the whole of defence, local government and the Department for Transport combined and enriching the highest income households almost seven times faster than the poorest.\u201d The leftwing thinktank, which has developed close links with Labour to become a key influencer of shadow Treasury thinking, estimates the current cost of the tax-free allowance is as much as \u00a3111.2bn. It said the change would transfer about \u00a38bn currently spent on tax allowances that benefit the 35% of highest income households to the rest of the country. The policy is likely to face opposition from some voters, as it would also mean bringing down the threshold for higher-rate taxpayers from \u00a350,000 to \u00a337,500. This is because the starting point for 40% income tax moves with the personal allowance. NEF said this would affect the top 13% of earners in the country. McDonnell said: \u201cThis is just the kind of innovative thinking we need on how to fix the imbalances and problems of our tax system. \u201cI hope it will be the start of a debate about how we make tax more progressive and deliver the public services funding that is so badly needed after nine years of austerity.\u201d The richest 10% of households will be \u00a31,470 better off by 2019-20 as a result of changes to the personal allowance since 2010, compared with just \u00a3130 for each of the poorest 10% of households. The Treasury said the personal allowance has removed nearly 2 million people from income tax, and that income inequality in Britain is falling. In a statement, it said: \u201cWe\u2019re raising the personal allowance one year early, which will mean that by April this year, 1.7 million income taxpayers will have been taken out of tax altogether since 2015-16. \u201cOur policies are highly redistributive. In 2019-20, the lowest income households will receive over \u00a34 in public spending for every \u00a31 they pay in tax on average, and the highest income households will contribute over \u00a35 in tax for every \u00a31 they receive in public spending on average. \u201cIncome inequality is lower now than it was in 2010.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 March 2019. In an earlier version, one of the calculations rounded the weekly payment down to \u00a348, resulting in a yearly total of \u00a32,496. This has been corrected to reflect the amounts given higher up the article, of \u00a348.08 a week and \u00a32,500.16 a year.",
