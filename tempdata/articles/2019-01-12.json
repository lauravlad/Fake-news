      "body": "<p>Epping Forest, a <a href=\"http://www.visiteppingforest.org/\" title=\"\">2,400-hectare woodland</a> straddling the border of London and Essex, has been home to hermits, hunters and highwaymen. Its shaded groves have sheltered children skiving off school and gay men seeking encounters. Babies have been born beside its twisted trees and bodies buried under them. It is both haven and hazard, its secrets known by criminals and preachers alike.</p> <p>Luke Turner, the 40-year-old author of a bold new memoir, <em>Out of the Woods</em>, which details his complicated relationship with the forest and his own troubled past, understands all this. The Epping Forest he depicts is not \u201csome twee fetishised place\u201d but rather an ever-changing landscape, by turns nurturing and terrifying, in which it is as easy to fall apart as to be saved.</p> <p>\u201cEpping Forest is where London goes to bury its dead and its secrets,\u201d he says of the landscape which has dominated his imagination since childhood. \u201cPart of the excitement about it is that it has this city energy \u2013 it\u2019s a place where you can hear planes coming in to land or motorbikes or the sirens on the M25 \u2013 but when you\u2019ve gone across the threshold, you are somewhere that\u2019s incredibly primal and I love that about it. It has a very odd energy that I think a rural woodland doesn\u2019t necessarily have.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s also, on a crisp January morning, eerily beautiful, its twisted trees casting strange shadows on the paths as we walk, talking about how Turner, the co-founder of cult music website <a href=\"https://thequietus.com/articles/02806-the-cult-love-reissue-review\" title=\"\">The Quietus</a>, saw this sprawling place where the wild and the ordered meet \u201cas the one constant\u201d of a peripatetic childhood.</p> <p>His father\u2019s job as a Methodist minister meant that the family moved around, but both his parents grew up on the forest border and climbed its trees as children, and his aunt and uncle still live in nearby Theydon Bois. Although Turner spent his adolescence in \u201chateful\u201d St Albans, the family regularly spent days out in the forest. It became an almost talismanic place, the repository of some of Turner\u2019s fondest early memories.</p> <p><em>Out of the Woods</em> details some of this, while delving deep into Turner\u2019s bisexuality, his depression after the collapse of a long-term relationship and the way in which residual shame from abusive sexual encounters in his early teens shaped his adult desires. Honest and often beautifully written, it is shot through with dry humour. In its pages is an understanding that, while nature cannot save you from yourself, it can offer even the most lost a kind of freedom \u2013 \u201cprovided you take your litter home\u201d.</p> <p>Small wonder, then, that it has been hailed as the latest in a growing number of highly personal accounts, such as Helen Macdonald\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/19/helen-macdonald-hawk-tree-man-natural-world\" title=\"\">H is for Hawk</a></em> and Amy Liptrot\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/25/the-outrun-amy-liptrot-review-orkney-alcoholic\" title=\"\">The Outrun</a></em>, which use nature to grapple with deeper issues. \u201cFor me it\u2019s not a book about nature\u2019s redemptive power but almost the opposite,\u201d says Turner. \u201cI get very frustrated with the idea that just being in nature will make you feel better, because for a long time I hated coming up here but couldn\u2019t seem to stop returning, almost out of a grim compulsion.\u201d</p> <p>The desperation Turner felt both here and in the city, where he was homeless after the end of a relationship and sleeping on friends\u2019 sofas and spare beds, only receded once he faced the demons of his adolescence head on. \u201cI realised that I wanted to write about things \u2013 like bisexuality \u2013 that are hidden away in contemporary conversations and so the book [which was originally conceived as a straightforward history of the forest] began to be more about my own personal experience.

      "bodyText": "Epping Forest, a 2,400-hectare woodland straddling the border of London and Essex, has been home to hermits, hunters and highwaymen. Its shaded groves have sheltered children skiving off school and gay men seeking encounters. Babies have been born beside its twisted trees and bodies buried under them. It is both haven and hazard, its secrets known by criminals and preachers alike. Luke Turner, the 40-year-old author of a bold new memoir, Out of the Woods, which details his complicated relationship with the forest and his own troubled past, understands all this. The Epping Forest he depicts is not \u201csome twee fetishised place\u201d but rather an ever-changing landscape, by turns nurturing and terrifying, in which it is as easy to fall apart as to be saved. \u201cEpping Forest is where London goes to bury its dead and its secrets,\u201d he says of the landscape which has dominated his imagination since childhood. \u201cPart of the excitement about it is that it has this city energy \u2013 it\u2019s a place where you can hear planes coming in to land or motorbikes or the sirens on the M25 \u2013 but when you\u2019ve gone across the threshold, you are somewhere that\u2019s incredibly primal and I love that about it. It has a very odd energy that I think a rural woodland doesn\u2019t necessarily have.\u201d It\u2019s also, on a crisp January morning, eerily beautiful, its twisted trees casting strange shadows on the paths as we walk, talking about how Turner, the co-founder of cult music website The Quietus, saw this sprawling place where the wild and the ordered meet \u201cas the one constant\u201d of a peripatetic childhood. His father\u2019s job as a Methodist minister meant that the family moved around, but both his parents grew up on the forest border and climbed its trees as children, and his aunt and uncle still live in nearby Theydon Bois. Although Turner spent his adolescence in \u201chateful\u201d St Albans, the family regularly spent days out in the forest. It became an almost talismanic place, the repository of some of Turner\u2019s fondest early memories. Out of the Woods details some of this, while delving deep into Turner\u2019s bisexuality, his depression after the collapse of a long-term relationship and the way in which residual shame from abusive sexual encounters in his early teens shaped his adult desires. Honest and often beautifully written, it is shot through with dry humour. In its pages is an understanding that, while nature cannot save you from yourself, it can offer even the most lost a kind of freedom \u2013 \u201cprovided you take your litter home\u201d. Small wonder, then, that it has been hailed as the latest in a growing number of highly personal accounts, such as Helen Macdonald\u2019s H is for Hawk and Amy Liptrot\u2019s The Outrun, which use nature to grapple with deeper issues. \u201cFor me it\u2019s not a book about nature\u2019s redemptive power but almost the opposite,\u201d says Turner. \u201cI get very frustrated with the idea that just being in nature will make you feel better, because for a long time I hated coming up here but couldn\u2019t seem to stop returning, almost out of a grim compulsion.\u201d The desperation Turner felt both here and in the city, where he was homeless after the end of a relationship and sleeping on friends\u2019 sofas and spare beds, only receded once he faced the demons of his adolescence head on. \u201cI realised that I wanted to write about things \u2013 like bisexuality \u2013 that are hidden away in contemporary conversations and so the book [which was originally conceived as a straightforward history of the forest] began to be more about my own personal experience. I wanted to say you don\u2019t have to split yourself in half. The truth can be found in the grey areas and the accepting of people\u2019s contradictions.\u201d The book consistently confounds expectations. Turner describes it as being about \u201creligion and compulsion and shame\u201d. Yet some of the best sections are those in which he writes about his family, their faith and the close-knit world in which he was raised. \u201cWhat\u2019s funny is that when I was writing it, I was very conscious I might be bashing religion, but then people have read it and joked that it\u2019s a right God-bothery book,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cBut, to be honest, the positives I got from being brought up in a religious family, particularly a Methodist family, and the love and community I got from that, have shaped everything I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d That said, he\u2019s not convinced his parents, loving as they are, should read it. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m still terrified about the idea that they might.

I am getting results for the hard work.</p> <p>\u201cGoran is an Aussie of Croatian background. We were based in Istanbul but now in London. Istanbul is a cool city.\u201d</p> <p>It might be of little consequence at this stage of her career, but Dart is on the same side of the draw as the world No 2 and 2016 champion, Angelique Kerber, who brings a run of good form to her opener against the unseeded Slovakian, Polona Hercog.</p> <p>The German said: \u201cThe tournament starts from zero, but I\u2019m here to find my rhythm in the first round, trying to do my best, then looking at the tournament day by day.\u201d</p> <p>Also playing on day one are Heather Watson, against 31st seed Petra Martic, first up on Court 14, and Katie Boulter, in the draw by right, against the Russian Ekaterina Makarova, also first up, on Court 12.

      "bodyText": "For Harriet Dart, who forced a tie-break out of the former world No 1 Karolina Pliskova at Wimbledon last year, the prospect of sharing a court with Maria Sharapova in the first round of the Australian Open is not as daunting as some might imagine. The 22-year-old Londoner, riding at a career-high 132 in the rankings, says of taking on the Russian \u2013 one of only five current players with a career grand slam \u2013 \u201cI am super excited to play in the main draw. Sharapova has been my idol since I was very little. But I have played the US Open and I have played Wimbledon twice in qualifying, where you have to win three matches against very high-level players.\u201d They open proceedings on the Rod Laver Arena on Monday morning local time, when the heat will be building; later in the afternoon Kyle Edmund plays Tomas Berdych on the re-named Melbourne Court, followed by Andy Murray against Roberto Bautista Agut, giving the day a very British feel. Dart began to deliver on her potential last year, winning her first ITF title then arriving at Wimbledon in buoyant mood and taking a set off the more accomplished of the Pliskova twin sisters, Karolina, in the first round, having beaten Kristyna at Eastbourne. She won another ITF title in Norway, on a retirement, then worked her way steadily up the rankings. \u201cI have been playing good tennis and hope to take that into the main draw and hopefully get some more matches,\u201d she said. She came from a 6-1 loss in the first set of her third match to beat the 10th qualifying seed, Ivana Jorovic, of Serbia, on Friday to seal her path into the draw, giving up one game in the deciding set. The leap in class on Monday will be dramatic. \u201cI looked up to [Sharapova] growing up,\u201d she said. \u201cOne, she always looked so nice when she was playing, and also the way she holds herself on the court, her presence. She has been so successful in the game. I was pretty young when she first won Wimbledon. It will be pretty cool to play her.\u201d She added: \u201cLast year I had a really good season. I started with a new coach [Goran Marijan]. I was training abroad in Turkey for a year and a bit. This year, we decided to go back to the UK because my coach is full-time with me. We have been working on my game, trying to improve things 5-10%. That makes a big difference when you put it all together. I have been happy I have stuck with it and implemented it in matches. I am getting results for the hard work. \u201cGoran is an Aussie of Croatian background. We were based in Istanbul but now in London. Istanbul is a cool city.\u201d It might be of little consequence at this stage of her career, but Dart is on the same side of the draw as the world No 2 and 2016 champion, Angelique Kerber, who brings a run of good form to her opener against the unseeded Slovakian, Polona Hercog. The German said: \u201cThe tournament starts from zero, but I\u2019m here to find my rhythm in the first round, trying to do my best, then looking at the tournament day by day.\u201d Also playing on day one are Heather Watson, against 31st seed Petra Martic, first up on Court 14, and Katie Boulter, in the draw by right, against the Russian Ekaterina Makarova, also first up, on Court 12. There are no guarantees any more in the women\u2019s game, so the British first wave might at least have the element of surprise against higher-ranked opposition. Meanwhile, the greatest of them all, Serena Williams, remained strangely silent, choosing not to give a pre-tournament press conference at the place where she won the most recent of her 23 slams, two years ago while seven weeks pregnant. She starts against the German Tatjana Maria and, as happens often, is locked into a section with her sister Venus, whom she beat in the final two years ago. The unseeded elder Williams plays the 25th seed, Mihaela Buzarnescu, and could meet Serena in the fourth round. The player who beat Serena to announce her arrival in the big time at the US Open last September, Naomi Osaka, was not so shy here as on that dramatic occasion. In an entertaining exchange on Saturday, she said she feels no different as a person to when she previously got into the draw here through qualifying. \u201cIt holds a lot of special memories,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel the same. It would be bad if I changed in three months.\u201d Asked if she was as open in private as she appears to be in public, she raised a smile when she replied: \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound rude to you guys, right? But when I sit here, it\u2019s, like, you guys aren\u2019t real people.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Labour MPs have been told to prepare for Jeremy Corbyn to table a dramatic and immediate vote of no confidence in Theresa May\u2019s government as early as Tuesday evening in an attempt to force a general election if \u2013 as expected \u2013 she suffers a heavy defeat this week on her Brexit deal.</p> <p>Messages have been sent to Labour MPs, even those who are unwell, to ensure their presence both for the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on the prime minister\u2019s Brexit blueprint on Tuesday and the following day. Labour whips have told MPs the no-confidence vote is likely to be tabled within hours of a government loss, with the actual vote taking place on Wednesday.</p> <p>The news comes before what promises to be one of the most tumultuous 24 hours in recent parliamentary history in which, barring another delay, May will put her Brexit deal to parliament despite deep and widespread opposition across the Commons, including from many MPs inside her own party.</p> <p>A senior shadow cabinet member said: \u201cThere is now recognition that we cannot wait any longer. If May goes down to defeat and she does not resign and call an election, this is the moment we have to act.\u201d</p> <p>Senior Tories said on Saturday that they could not see how the prime minister could win the meaningful vote \u201cin any circumstances\u201d and that a defeat by less than 100 would now be regarded as the best she could hope for.</p> <p>But even if she suffered a loss of closer to 200, which many Tories fear could be the case, Conservative MPs and ministers still expect her to stagger on and seek to bring an improved offer back to the Commons for a further vote within weeks.</p> <p>Although senior Labour figures accept they are unlikely to win a no-confidence vote, as the 10 Democratic Unionist MPs have said they will back the government, the move will highlight the fragility of May\u2019s hold on power as the Brexit crisis deepens.</p> <p>Yet should Corbyn fail to force an election, it will place the Labour leader under greater pressure from many of his own MPs, as well as party members and supporters, to throw his weight behind a second referendum as the way to break the Brexit impasse.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s current policy is to seek to force an election, and if it wins, to renegotiate a new Brexit deal. Senior shadow cabinet figures said any further delay in tabling a no-confidence motion will make that position untenable, as there will be insufficient time before Britain\u2019s exit from the EU on 29 March to hold an election.</p> <p>The Observer understands that if Corbyn were to delay tabling a vote of no confidence, senior Labour MPs would table one themselves in the hope of forcing the leadership to back a second referendum. Angela Smith, Labour MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said: \u201cThe time for prevarication is over. If May\u2019s deal fails we have to test the will of the house and if we fail, we must consider all options including campaigning for a second referendum as this is party policy.\u201d</p> <p>A Labour spokesman, while not confirming a vote on Tuesday, said that while the timing of a no-confidence vote had not been fixed, MPs had been told to be ready. Barry Gardiner, the shadow trade minister, said last week that a vote of no confidence would \u201cobviously\u201d have to follow immediately after a defeat for May\u2019s deal.</p> <p>A Momentum activist, Michael Chessum, spokesman for the leftwing anti-Brexit campaign <a href=\"https://www.anothereurope.org/\">Another Europe is Possible</a>, said that if Labour won the confidence vote, it would be time for Corbyn to back a second referendum as part of the Labour manifesto. If it lost, it should campaign for one as the official opposition.</p> <p>He said: \u201cProposing a no-confidence motion is the first step for either scenario, and we need to get on with it.\u201d Labour campaigners for a second referendum claim that the party\u2019s policy forum has received more than 13,000 emails and letters urging Corbyn to oppose Brexit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c1eb43beac2d74ef3081a9fda218c7b054682a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c1eb43beac2d74ef3081a9fda218c7b054682a6/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roy Hattersley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roy Hattersley, the Labour grandee, says the British people should have a vote on Theresa May\u2019s deal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/13/eu-brexit-referendum-positive-case-remain-sadiq-khan\">Writing in the Observer, London\u2019s Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan</a> said that he will step up his campaign for another referendum if an election is not called immediately: \u201cA public vote would not only allow us to move beyond the current stalemate but would actually start the desperately needed process of healing the deep divisions that have opened within our society.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/13/eu-brexit-referendum-positive-case-remain-sadiq-khan\">If May stays at No 10, I\u2019m starting Project Hope, the positive case for remain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Roy Hattersley, the veteran Labour politician, also threw his weight behind a second referendum on Saturday, saying the British people had \u201ca right to cast a vote on the merits\u201d of May\u2019s deal.</p> <p>Meanwhile, pro-remain cabinet ministers are preparing to push for a softer Brexit this week. In the event of a defeat for May, they are poised to back a plan B that would prevent Britain from signing its own trade deals.</p> <p>It is understood some believe that joining a permanent customs union with the EU could be enough to secure a Commons majority for May\u2019s deal.

      "bodyText": "Labour MPs have been told to prepare for Jeremy Corbyn to table a dramatic and immediate vote of no confidence in Theresa May\u2019s government as early as Tuesday evening in an attempt to force a general election if \u2013 as expected \u2013 she suffers a heavy defeat this week on her Brexit deal. Messages have been sent to Labour MPs, even those who are unwell, to ensure their presence both for the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on the prime minister\u2019s Brexit blueprint on Tuesday and the following day. Labour whips have told MPs the no-confidence vote is likely to be tabled within hours of a government loss, with the actual vote taking place on Wednesday. The news comes before what promises to be one of the most tumultuous 24 hours in recent parliamentary history in which, barring another delay, May will put her Brexit deal to parliament despite deep and widespread opposition across the Commons, including from many MPs inside her own party. A senior shadow cabinet member said: \u201cThere is now recognition that we cannot wait any longer. If May goes down to defeat and she does not resign and call an election, this is the moment we have to act.\u201d Senior Tories said on Saturday that they could not see how the prime minister could win the meaningful vote \u201cin any circumstances\u201d and that a defeat by less than 100 would now be regarded as the best she could hope for. But even if she suffered a loss of closer to 200, which many Tories fear could be the case, Conservative MPs and ministers still expect her to stagger on and seek to bring an improved offer back to the Commons for a further vote within weeks. Although senior Labour figures accept they are unlikely to win a no-confidence vote, as the 10 Democratic Unionist MPs have said they will back the government, the move will highlight the fragility of May\u2019s hold on power as the Brexit crisis deepens. Yet should Corbyn fail to force an election, it will place the Labour leader under greater pressure from many of his own MPs, as well as party members and supporters, to throw his weight behind a second referendum as the way to break the Brexit impasse. Labour\u2019s current policy is to seek to force an election, and if it wins, to renegotiate a new Brexit deal. Senior shadow cabinet figures said any further delay in tabling a no-confidence motion will make that position untenable, as there will be insufficient time before Britain\u2019s exit from the EU on 29 March to hold an election. The Observer understands that if Corbyn were to delay tabling a vote of no confidence, senior Labour MPs would table one themselves in the hope of forcing the leadership to back a second referendum. Angela Smith, Labour MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said: \u201cThe time for prevarication is over. If May\u2019s deal fails we have to test the will of the house and if we fail, we must consider all options including campaigning for a second referendum as this is party policy.\u201d A Labour spokesman, while not confirming a vote on Tuesday, said that while the timing of a no-confidence vote had not been fixed, MPs had been told to be ready. Barry Gardiner, the shadow trade minister, said last week that a vote of no confidence would \u201cobviously\u201d have to follow immediately after a defeat for May\u2019s deal. A Momentum activist, Michael Chessum, spokesman for the leftwing anti-Brexit campaign Another Europe is Possible, said that if Labour won the confidence vote, it would be time for Corbyn to back a second referendum as part of the Labour manifesto. If it lost, it should campaign for one as the official opposition. He said: \u201cProposing a no-confidence motion is the first step for either scenario, and we need to get on with it.\u201d Labour campaigners for a second referendum claim that the party\u2019s policy forum has received more than 13,000 emails and letters urging Corbyn to oppose Brexit. Writing in the Observer, London\u2019s Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan said that he will step up his campaign for another referendum if an election is not called immediately: \u201cA public vote would not only allow us to move beyond the current stalemate but would actually start the desperately needed process of healing the deep divisions that have opened within our society.\u201d Roy Hattersley, the veteran Labour politician, also threw his weight behind a second referendum on Saturday, saying the British people had \u201ca right to cast a vote on the merits\u201d of May\u2019s deal. Meanwhile, pro-remain cabinet ministers are preparing to push for a softer Brexit this week. In the event of a defeat for May, they are poised to back a plan B that would prevent Britain from signing its own trade deals. It is understood some believe that joining a permanent customs union with the EU could be enough to secure a Commons majority for May\u2019s deal. This could be one option put forward in a series of indicative votes to test the views of MPs on alternatives if her plan is thrown out. Such a move would potentially attract a bloc of Labour MPs. With a critical week ahead, Tory rebels are already plotting a series of measures designed to hand more power to parliament over Brexit. One senior figure said that a \u201clegally copper-bottomed\u201d plan had already been drawn up to \u201cgive parliament control of the Brexit negotiation and stop a no-deal Brexit\u201d should May\u2019s deal be voted down. A vote to show there is a Commons majority in favour of delaying Brexit is also being plotted by a cross-party group of MPs. \u201cIf we are not crashing out and we are not going for the PM\u2019s deal, I cannot believe that article 50 does not have to be extended,\u201d said one of those involved. The business secretary, Greg Clark, also writing in the Observer, has appealed to pro-Brexit Labour MPs to back May\u2019s deal, insisting that the government would protect workers\u2019 rights when the UK is outside the EU.

We knew when we were together it was going to be a lot of fun and a lot of banter and some good vibes. He\u2019s hilarious, he\u2019s so funny. His tennis gets enough recognition. He was an unbelievable player. He was one of the toughest people I ever played against. But I don\u2019t think he gets enough credit for how he was off the court, just as a normal person. He was so humble, he was so down to earth, he just loved to have some fun, he loved to have a good time. I genuinely got excited to be at the courts and maybe see him during the day and have some lunch with him and just catch up. He made your day better. He took me under his wing when I was young, but then when he knew that I was kind of a free spirit, doing whatever I want to do, it just became more of a friendly-type relationship. When we were together, we never talked about tennis. There was just so much shit-talking and banter, it was so good. Everyone knew that when we were together it was just good vibes, everyone knew that it was so laid\u2011back. It was so easy to be around him. It was awesome and I\u2019m going to miss him a lot. When I played him the first couple of times, I just felt so young on the court. I almost was beaten before I went out there. When I played Roger [Federer], when I played Rafa [Nadal], I wasn\u2019t as scared of those guys as I was of Andy. I knew that his game was a lot tougher for a guy like me to play, I knew he was going to make a lot of balls, so I felt so young when I played him the first couple of times. I didn\u2019t really believe in my physicality. I knew that I couldn\u2019t play long rallies with him and I knew I couldn\u2019t last against him. I would have loved to have played him when he was in his prime as I am now, it would maybe have been a much more competitive match. I\u2019m not saying I would have won. To get one win over him [in the first round of the Aegon Championships at Queen\u2019s Club last summer] was good and I beat him [in 2016] at the Hopman Cup [the mixed team event in Perth] \u2013 I know that\u2019s not an official event \u2013 but I did play well there. I always tell him, I look at [Novak] Djokovic, I look at how many grand slams he has won and the results he has had and I\u2019m just thinking \u2026 I always tell him: \u2018Dude, you\u2019re so much better than Djokovic, you should have a way better career.\u2019 I give him shit about it all the time. I\u2019m always telling him that, you\u2019re a tough player to play against. But he definitely had my number on the court. He played while three of the greatest of all-time played [Federer, Nadal and Djokovic], which is never easy, and guys like Stan [Wawrinka] in grand slams always step up to the plate. But Andy got the most out of his career, he ticked all the boxes, he did everything to the absolute T, so it\u2019s misfortune for him that his body kind of let him down. But he\u2019s not going to regret anything that he did. It would have been cool to play doubles with him once. I\u2019m not sure where it could be and singles is a priority for him but you never know. Who knows, maybe it could happen at Wimbledon. Fingers crossed, if his body stays good, I would love to play doubles with him there. I\u2019ve never played doubles at Wimbledon before and I think it would be cool.",

Chelsea did eventually recruit him, as a regional scouting coordinator for East Anglia, and Carson also had strong links to youth football in Finland and Denmark. He took hundreds of players on tours abroad and had a website claiming: \u201cI probably know more about European grassroots soccer than almost any other youth developer in England, having travelled to European nations with soccer teams well over 500 times.\u201d The website had testimonies not only from Bellamy and Etherington but also Dan Ashworth, until recently the FA\u2019s technical director.

To which the next question might reasonably have been: was it necessary for them to remove their pants, too?</p> <p>He was charged with 12 offences, all relating to boys under 16, from incidents mainly in Cambridgeshire. One, however, allegedly took place at a hotel in the north-west. Three were at Peterborough\u2019s training ground.

Ben Coker, who played at Cambridge and is now at Southend, was one. Shortly before Carson\u2019s arrest in January 2017 Coker said the complainants were \u201cjumping on the bandwagon\u201d and that he had been in contact with Carson to offer support. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they\u2019re doing this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes me angry.\u201d</p> <p>Except I can also remember the \u201cFriends of Barry Bennell\u201d fund that was set up after the first boy came forward, in 1994, to say he had been raped by the former Crewe and Manchester City coach. People were angry then, too. So angry, indeed, that many wrote to court accusing the boy, aged 13, of making it up, of sour grapes and worse because, they said, he was bitter about the fact he was not good enough to make it as a professional footballer. Bennell\u2019s friends and sympathisers raised thousands of pounds for the monster who is now serving a 31-year prison sentence.</p> <p>That is the thing about the people who use football as a means to prey on children: they are clever, they hide their crimes well, they know popularity is a shield and their roles automatically puts them in a position of strength, holding the dreams of those youngsters.

And if there is one thing I have learned during the last few years investigating the various offenders, it is that they are bloody good at what they do.</p> <p>And Kit Carson? None of us can claim to know whether he was a calculated, devious paedophile apart from the 11 footballers, now in their 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s, who were willing, one by one, to stand up in front of a jury, face an interrogation from the defence barrister and go through the graphic details of what they allege their old coach did to them.

Lampard could look at Chelsea when it comes to spying Frank Lampard was clearly very upset, with some justification, about the discovery of a Leeds employee hiding in the bushes to spy on Derby\u2019s training before the teams played each other at Elland Road on Friday. But don\u2019t think it is only Marcelo Bielsa, the Leeds manager, who would pull such a stunt. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph in 2011, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas said he would regularly visit opposition training grounds, \u201coften incognito,\u201d for spying missions as part of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s backroom staff at Chelsea. A 3-0 win against Newcastle in November 2005 was referenced, when Villas\u2011Boas provided Chelsea with a dossier containing 24 tactical graphics. Lampard is entitled to be upset with Bielsa \u2013 but maybe he should consider who was wearing the No 8 shirt in Chelsea\u2019s midfield that day.",

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s that. Thanks for reading! Rafa Benitez talks. \u201cThe team worked so hard, you could see every player fighting to the end. But we were playing a very good team, and Willian was great. The reaction of the team to falling behind was good. We made a couple of big mistakes but we defended well, and played on the counter-attack. On another day we could have got something. We know that we have difficult games. When you play the top teams in two or three games in a row, maybe you won\u2019t get the points you want. But we have to be strong enough to get the points we need.\u201d Maurizio Sarri speaks. \u201cI was very happy with the performance against Tottenham. But today I am happy with the result, but not the performance. It was not so good, especially from between 1-0 and 1-1. We could have done better, but today it was really important to win points. We slept for 25 minutes and let them back in the match. Maybe we thought after our goal it is very easy. But it wasn\u2019t! Willian is very important for us. He has to stay with us. A seven-point gap over Arsenal is very useful, but we have to play a lot of matches.\u201d Ed Aarons was at Stamford Bridge tonight. Here\u2019s his report! Chelsea\u2019s goalscorers Willian and Pedro are sent out for a post-match chat. It\u2019s the usual thing, great to earn three points, happy for the fans, onto the next game, etc. But there\u2019s one charming moment when BT Sport quiz Willian about his future. At which point, footballers normally play it with a straight bat. But Willian smiles broadly and cheekily. \u201cMy future? My future is here with Chelsea! I don\u2019t know what you are talking about.\u201d So some good news there for Chelsea fans. Chelsea take a good grip of fourth place. They move six points ahead of fifth-placed Arsenal, and nine ahead of sixth-placed Manchester United, the latter with a game in hand and a chance to close that gap tomorrow. They\u2019re only a point behind third-placed Tottenham Hotspur. It\u2019s Arsenal next weekend! Newcastle meanwhile remain in the bottom three. However with Cardiff City up next at St James\u2019 Park, they\u2019ll be hopeful of addressing that situation positively, and in short order. Not least because they play Manchester City and Tottenham afterwards. Longstaff bursts into the Chelsea box down the right. He shoots for the top right. The ball takes a clip off Luiz, and it\u2019s a corner to Newcastle. They load the box, but Ritchie and Atsu play it short, wasting the chance to put some late, late pressure on the hosts. Atsu eventually hoicks the ball over everyone\u2019s head, and that\u2019s that! Rafa wears a look of incredulity at what he\u2019s just seen. 90 min +3: Chelsea knock it about, letting the clock do its thing. 90 min +2: Kante slips a pass wide right for Azpilicueta. He\u2019s got men in the middle, but can\u2019t find any of them with his cross. He\u2019s unable to get the ball past first man Lascelles. 90 min +1: Willian busts a gut to earn a corner down the left. He then wastes it, with a little help from Hudson-Odoi, as the pair play it short and achieve nothing. 90 min: There will be four added minutes. 89 min: Longstaff looks to send Ritchie away down the left with another impressive crossfield ball. But it\u2019s delivered just an inch or two too far upfield. 87 min: Hazard is replaced by Giroud. \u201cIn response to Benjamin Park, we should be just fine for top four without buying a striker in January,\u201d opines Ciaran Crowther. \u201cHazard is auditioning for Real, remember, so his goals will probably be enough for top four before we say our goodbyes to him in the summer. Man United might challenge us if the Solskjaer feel-good effect puts them on a winning streak. Thinking long-term, a striker is urgently needed. Major investment needed during the summer in order to challenge for the title next season.\u201d 86 min: Manquillo curls into the Chelsea box from a deep position on the right. Rondon rises above Azpilicueta at the far post, but his header flies wide left. A real chance spurned. Should he have gone back across Kepa towards the right-hand side of goal? 85 min: Jorginho tries to spring Hudson-Odoi clear down the right with a fizzing diagonal pass. But the young man goes too early, and the flag goes up for offside. 84 min: The Chelsea crowd are nervous all right, as their team defend this slim lead. Hazard plays a flick that doesn\u2019t come off in the midfield, and the groans nearly take the roof off the stadium. 82 min: A double switch by Newcastle, as Perez and Yedlin are replaced by Murphy and Manquillo. 80 min: Hudson-Odoi replaces Pedro. The young Bayern Munich target is immediately serenaded with \u201cWe want you to stay\u201d by the home support. 79 min: A period of possession for Newcastle now. Some patient passing. Longstaff strokes a lovely right-to-left ball to release Ritchie on the left. Ritchie\u2019s cross is deflected out for a corner. The set piece is wasted, but there\u2019s a sign that Newcastle are far from out of this match. A few nerves around Stamford Bridge. 77 min: Luiz is happily back up and about. A sore one, nothing more. 75 min: Rondon chests down a long ball, then lays off to Perez, who attempts to dribble his way into the Chelsea box. Luiz puts a stop to his gallop. Perez slips and catches Luiz as he falls, clattering into the defender\u2019s standing leg. A free kick for Chelsea, and some necessary treatment to Luiz\u2019s knee, which took a good old whack there. 73 min: Luiz sends the free kick towards the top left ... but it\u2019s swerving all over the shop, and ends up missing the target by a big margin, high and to the left. 72 min: Chelsea put a stop to that with a period of sterile domination. A lot of pretty passing in triangles. They don\u2019t look to be going anywhere, so Newcastle will be annoyed to see Perez lose his patience and needlessly bowl Alonso to the ground, 30 yards out. A chance for Luiz or Willian to score a trademark set-piece screamer? 70 min: Two-pass moves come at a premium right now. All very scrappy. 68 min: Lascelles is back on. Chelsea ping it around in the patient fashion, but go absolutely nowhere. A rare lull with quarter of the match remaining. 67 min: Lascelles injured himself while ensuring that Willian effort went out for a corner, running out of pitch and clattering into the advertising hoardings. He\u2019s gashed his knee badly. He looks like he wants to continue, but he\u2019s currently off the pitch getting some treatment. 65 min: The Luiz-Willian combination nearly undoes Newcastle again. Luiz rakes a long pass down the left that releases his team-mate. Willian draws Dubravka but this time the keeper gets a touch to ensure the ball goes wide left of the goal. Nothing comes of the corner. 63 min: Barkley comes on for Kovacic. 62 min: Jorginho is booked for a cynical tug on Rondon. 61 min: Perez and Rondon one-two their way into the Chelsea box. As Perez steps into the area, Rudiger gently tugs his wrist. Perez goes down, and he wants a penalty. He\u2019s not getting it. Newcastle supporters who recall the Mo Salah incident on Boxing Day are permitted to raise their eyebrows. But it would have been a very soft penalty. 60 min: Hazard goes scampering down the inside-right channel. It\u2019s a determined burst, but he\u2019s robbed by Atsu, who sticks in a toe from behind. It\u2019s a fine tackle. Hazard goes over, and the Chelsea fans explode in collective apoplexy. But the referee waves play on, and he\u2019s called it right. 59 min: Do Newcastle have a second equaliser in them? That goal\u2019s understandably deflated them; they were giving as good as they were getting beforehand. Chelsea by contrast are renewed. There appears to be an extra bounce in Hazard\u2019s step, which doesn\u2019t augur well for the Toon. What was that we were saying about a lack of quality in this game? Scrub that! No more! Hazard slips a pass down the left for Willian, who enters the box, shifts the ball onto his right foot, and curls a delicious shot across Dubravka and into the top right! The keeper had no chance! That was a lovely goal! 56 min: Alonso zips down the left wing and pulls one back for Pedro, on the penalty spot. Pedro takes a first-time swipe, but there\u2019s no power in the shot and it\u2019s straight at Dubravka. 55 min: ... some head tennis. Lascelles tugs Rudiger, but gets away with it. Dubravka flaps. Newcastle can\u2019t clear, but eventually the flag goes up for offside. There hasn\u2019t been too much quality play in this match, but it\u2019s been wonderfully entertaining ... and good luck predicting the outcome. 54 min: Kante\u2019s not having it, though. He snaps into a challenge to strip Hayden of possession, and drives towards the Newcastle box. He slips a pass left for Willian, who enters the area and sees a low shot turned into the side netting. From the corner ... 53 min: Jorginho, in space and with time 30 yards out, sprays a pass into the stand on the left. The home crowd aren\u2019t happy. Chelsea suddenly look a team with the weight of the world on their shoulders. 52 min: Luiz nearly splits Newcastle\u2019s defence with a sliderule pass down the middle. Hazard can\u2019t quite get onto the ball; Lejeune hoicks it away from danger. 51 min: Chelsea don\u2019t look totally at the races. Luiz miskicks and nearly lets Rondon scamper clear. Hazard miscontrols. Kante lets a simple ball run under his boot. The crowd are vocal in their frustration. 49 min: Ritchie makes good down the left. His cross is eyebrowed away from goal at the near post by Atsu, who might have done well to leave the header to Rondon, standing behind him. 48 min: After making a superb save to keep Newcastle level, Dubravka looks to pluck the corner from the sky. He then drops it, and Ritchie is forced to hook away from Luiz in an emergency. Chelsea so close to regaining their lead! 47 min: A loose pass by Lascelles, 30 yards from goal, allows Kovacic to burst towards the Newcastle box. He slips the ball wide to Pedro, who is one on one with Dubravka. Pedro creams one towards the bottom left, but the keeper tips it around the post! And we\u2019re off again! Newcastle get the ball rolling for the second half. No changes. \u201cChelsea NEED a striker,\u201d hollers Benjamin Park. \u201cWillian plays wide, Hazard plays wide, and guess where Pedro plays. When the ball is on the wings, there\u2019s nobody to put a cross into. Even the through balls go through the wings. Not sure if we can keep top four unless something changes ASAP.\u201d Half-time reading. Rafa is far from the only Premier League manager with problems. Here\u2019s our man Andy Hunter on under-pressure Everton boss Marco Silva. Chelsea are booed off by a section of their own support, which is a bit harsh. They were the better team for most of that first half. But Newcastle fought their way back into it, and after the equaliser looked very lively indeed. This could be a very interesting second half, so don\u2019t be going out for your Saturday night quite yet! 45 min: Atsu and Rudiger combine at speed down the right. Eventually Yedlin is sent scampering away on the overlap, but he can\u2019t find a team-mate in the area. Newcastle are suddenly a free-flowing confident collective! Chelsea need the half-time whistle desperately. They\u2019ve got two added minutes to survive. 43 min: And now Rondon, pressing hard, bothers last man Rudiger, but can\u2019t nick the ball off the defender. Chelsea work the ball away from danger. 42 min: This is suddenly a brilliantly entertaining match. Yedlin works his way down the right and hooks high into the Chelsea box. Ritchie meets the dropping ball with a volley from 12 yards ... but screws it miles wide right. Full marks for ambition, if not execution. 41 min: And Chelsea should have regained the lead within seconds! Kovacic wedges a pass down the inside left, releasing Willian into acres, the Newcastle defence totally asleep. He\u2019s got to score, having drawn Dubravka off his line. But he pulls a shot wide left from close range. On the touchline, Rafa has reached the stage of teeth-baring anger. Clark, on the penalty spot, rises between Rudiger and Luiz and plants a stunning downward header into the bottom left. Kepa had no chance! That was perfectly placed. And it had been coming, Newcastle working their way slowly back into the game after a sluggish start. 39 min: ... Luiz is forced to head behind in a panic with plenty of black and white shirts lurking. And from the second corner ... 38 min: Another corner for Chelsea on the left; another non-event. Newcastle go straight up the other end, Atsu winning one off Pedro on the left. From which ... 37 min: Rondon strips Jorginho of the ball, as the Chelsea midfielder faffs about in the midfield. Rondon races away, with Chelsea light at the back. But the play\u2019s pulled back for the lightest of tugs. Jorginho a little bit lucky there; there are plenty of referees who would have waved play on. 35 min: Newcastle should be level. Rondon beats Luiz to a long ball, and sends Perez clear down the inside-right channel. He\u2019s only got Kepa to beat, but slices his shot wide right. That\u2019s poor, though perhaps good karma, because replays suggest Perez might have been just offside. So in that sense, fair\u2019s fair. The flag didn\u2019t go up, though. 34 min: Kante clips Ritchie out on the left. A chance to load the box. The free kick\u2019s tapped to Atsu, who can\u2019t beat the first man. On the bench, steam continues to pour from Rafa\u2019s lugs. 33 min: Chelsea attempt to reestablish their command by stroking the ball around the midfield awhile. Then Pedro has a dig from distance, but his shot, from the best part of 30 yards, bobbles harmlessly through to Dubravka. 31 min: Lascelles replays that crossfield ball to Yedlin. It\u2019s well worth watching again. Once more, Yedlin isn\u2019t able to engineer enough space on the wing to cross, but Newcastle are at least slowly working their way back into this match. 29 min: Rondon takes down a long ball, then one-twos with Perez. It\u2019s direct and effective, but when Rondon takes a stride into the box, he slashes wildly at the ball and sends it sailing miles to the left of goal. Still, that\u2019s much better from Newcastle. 28 min: Some space and time for Pedro out on the left. He nearly releases Kovacic into the area with a cute diagonal pass, but it\u2019s a bit overcooked and the ball flies through to Dubravka. 27 min: But Chelsea don\u2019t clear their lines particularly convincingly, and Newcastle come again. A poor Azpilicueta header allows Lejeune a volley, just to the left of the D. It\u2019s a fine hit, but straight at Kepa, who gathers without drama. 26 min: Suddenly Newcastle show a little in attack, Hayden sending Perez scampering down the right. He\u2019s got Rondon in the middle, but his cross is blocked out by Luiz. The resulting corner is a non-event. 25 min: Willian takes, and scoops a ball to the far post. Luiz rushes in and crashes a header goalwards; it\u2019s deflected over the bar by Lascelles. Chelsea don\u2019t get the corner, though. 24 min: Pedro slips a pass down the inside-right channel for Azpilicueta, who is in the process of rounding Ritchie at high speed when he\u2019s nicked and brought down. A booking for Ritchie, and a free kick just to the right of the Newcastle box. 22 min: But it goes nowhere. Yedlin, deep on the right, sprays one towards Atsu on the left. Atsu goes too soon, and is caught offside. Atsu had the full picture there, he had no need to drift offside. 21 min: A period of sweet possession for Newcastle, their first of the match. Time for everyone to get a touch and hopefully rebuild a little confidence. 19 min: Azpilicueta rakes a long ball down the right for Kante, who can\u2019t quite circumnavigate Clarke. Had Kante got there a split second earlier, he was through on goal. Newcastle need to hang on here. 17 min: Kovacic nearly skins Lejeune down the left, but just as it looks as though he\u2019ll sprint free into the Newcastle box, the defender sticks out a leg. Corner. This one doesn\u2019t clear the first man. 16 min: Chelsea continue to stroke it around in a very dominant fashion. 14 min: Hazard wins a corner down the left, though it doesn\u2019t come to much, Rudiger shoving Dubravka in the back. Free kick, and the pressure\u2019s off Newcastle. Hats off to Sarri, by the way, who made it clear that Pedro was his solution to Chelsea\u2019s recent goalscoring troubles. It didn\u2019t take Pedro long to solve the puzzle. 13 min: Chelsea are pinging it around in a very pleasing style right now. Luiz passing long, Hazard scuttling around with menace, Jorginho keeping it all ticking. 11 min: Lascelles sends a glorious left-to-right crossfield ball towards Yedlin, who nearly romps into acres on the left. But he\u2019s stopped in his tracks by Alonso. On the touchline, Benitez is currently producing a volume of smoke Sarri can only dream of, though it\u2019s all coming out of his ears. He wasn\u2019t happy with Clark or Ritchie, who were both caught napping by that long Luiz pass for the goal. Well they\u2019ll have to do more than defend now. Luiz, to the left of the centre circle in his own half, rakes a lovely long pass towards Pedro, who gets a yard on Clark down the inside-right channel. He takes the ball down, lets Dubravka come off his line, and lifts a precise finish over the keeper and into the net! That\u2019s a really pretty route-one goal. 8 min: Rondon chases down Luiz, who was faffing around out on the Chelsea left. That forces Luiz to roll back to Kepa. Rudiger is then hassled by Atsu on the other flank, briefly causing panic. A sign that Newcastle aren\u2019t just here to defend? 6 min: Not a whole lot going on yet. Chelsea are bossing possession, but Newcastle seem quite happy to sit back, and the hosts haven\u2019t managed to move a packed defence around to any great effect. Early days of course. 4 min: Kante glides in from the right and slips the ball to Hazard, who very nearly spins past Lascelles into an awful lot of space. But the Newcastle defender manages to stick to his man and Hazard eventually loses control. 2 min: The travelling Toon support make their feelings for Mike Ashley known, via the medium of song \u2018n\u2019 swearies. You don\u2019t need me to explain any further. 1 min: It\u2019s kind of a false start, as Willian almost immediately goes down under not much pressure from Lejeune. Has he twisted an ankle in an awkward fall? He limps around gingerly but it looks as though he\u2019s good to go. And we\u2019re off! A wonderful post-Saturday-afternoon-in-public-bar atmosphere in Stamford Bridge. The hosts get the party started. The teams are out! Chelsea are in their famous blue, while Newcastle wear their classic black and white. A quick blast of The Liquidator, and we\u2019ll be off in a minute! Rafa talks! But only in a pre-recorded segment, where he straight bats all questions about the transfer window and his own contract. Instead he preaches unity with a righteous zeal. In these troubled times, he\u2019d make a great prime minister, president, army general or cult leader. Oil on troubled waters. Maurizio Sarri speaks! \u201cWe know very well the situation. We have some problems. We are playing well, I think, but we are having a problem to score in this moment. We are trying to solve it. It\u2019s not easy. But we have to do it. Pedro is very important for us, he is good in the spaces. We are trying to solve a problem, and we are trying to do so with Pedro.\u201d So this afternoon\u2019s 3pm kick-offs haven\u2019t done Newcastle United any favours. Burnley beat Fulham 2-1 at Turf Moor. Southampton won 2-1 at Leicester City. And Cardiff City drew 0-0 with Huddersfield Town. All of that means Newcastle plummet into the bottom three ahead of this match. They\u2019re in 18th place with the same number of points, one adrift of Cardiff and Saints, three behind Burnley. Newcastle are in a relegation battle all right. A peek behind the scenes. Shirts, towels, shinpads, programmes and flip-flops in the home dressing room. Some tasteful wood panelling offset by benching covered in towelling. Or is it a moleskin finish? Either way, not 100 percent sure that\u2019s practical. Chelsea make two changes to the side named for their last Premier League game, the goalless draw here with Southampton. Mateo Kovacic and Pedro take the places of Ross Barkley and Alvaro Morata. Newcastle make three changes to the teamsheet handed in for the home defeat to Manchester United. Fabian Schar, Mohamed Diame and Paul Dummett make way for Florian Lejeune, Ciaran Clark and the 21-year-old midfielder Sean Longstaff, who makes his first League start for the Magpies. Chelsea: Arrizabalaga, Azpilicueta, Rudiger, Luiz, Alonso, Kante, Jorginho, Kovacic, Pedro, Hazard, Willian. Subs: Barkley, Caballero, Giroud, Hudson-Odoi, Christensen, Emerson Palmieri, Ampadu. Newcastle United: Dubravka, Yedlin, Lejeune, Lascelles, Clark, Ritchie, Perez, Longstaff, Hayden, Atsu, Rondon. Subs: Schar, Murphy, Fernandez, Manquillo, Joselu, Sterry, Woodman. Referee: Chris Kavanagh (Lancashire). Chelsea\u2019s last couple of Premier League home games haven\u2019t gone exactly to plan: a 0-0 draw with Southampton and a 0-1 loss to Leicester. So they\u2019ll welcome Newcastle United to Stamford Bridge this evening with open arms. Here\u2019s how this particular fixture has panned out recently: 3-0, 3-1, 5-1, 2-0, 3-0, 2-0. The arrival of the struggling Magpies will be a sight for sore eyes. Especially as Rafa Benitez\u2019s men have only won one of their last nine matches. Chelsea might not be firing on all cylinders at present, but they were the better side against Spurs midweek in the first leg of their League Cup semi, despite the result, and will be hopeful their overall performance at Wembley is a promise of better things to come. But while Newcastle may be labouring, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re super-easy to pick off. They\u2019ve only lost three of their ten matches on the road this season. They\u2019ve won at Huddersfield and Burnley. On another day, with a bit more luck, they could have got something at Manchester City and Manchester United. Rafa knows how to set up his side in Resolute Mode all right. So nothing\u2019s certain. Chelsea are desperate for the win that\u2019ll keep them on course for a top-four finish. Newcastle are desperate for the points that\u2019ll keep their heads above water. It\u2019s set up nicely ... and it\u2019s on! Kick off: 5.30pm GMT.",

The Victorian government has granted a planning permit for WestWind Energy\u2019s $1.5bn Golden Plains windfarm, which will become one of the largest windfarms in the southern hemisphere. The project is now awaiting federal approval to proceed. The windfarm would span 17,000 hectares on land 60km north-west of Geelong and generate more than 3000 gigawatt hours of electricity per year \u2013 enough to power more than 400,000 homes. Tobias Geiger, the managing director of WestWind Energy, said the large scale project would be able to supply energy at low cost. \u201cWith this very large project and very good wind resource, combined with the latest wind turbine technology that\u2019s now available, we can achieve a levelised cost of energy for this project that is below $50 per MW/h,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you put that into the context of electricity market prices from Victoria which for the past two years have hovered around $80 to $120 per MW/h, you can see the significance of this project for driving down electricity prices for all Victorians.\u201d The company has begun detailed design work and an application for grid connection through the Australian Energy Market Operator. That process will take about a year before construction could commence. The Victorian government\u2019s approval of the project requires the company to increase the turbine-free buffer area to protect nesting grounds used by native brolga birds. That will reduce the original proposal from 228 turbines and may result in a reduction to 181 turbines. Geiger said on Saturday the company estimated it would construct around 200 turbines. \u201cWe\u2019re facing very exciting times for renewable energy and in particular the transition from thermal generation to renewables,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Golden Plains windfarm will replace about one third of the generation of the Hazelwood power station.

      "body": "<p>Liverpool did not sparkle here but, more importantly, nor did they wobble. After losing their unbeaten record to Manchester City they returned to winning ways thanks to a second-half penalty by Mohamed Salah. It was a narrow victory but one that restores Liverpool\u2019s seven-point lead at the top of the Premier League and challenges City to close the gap again when they host Wolves .</p> \n<p>Defeats in their two previous matches led to this being billed as a particularly revealing interrogation of Liverpool, with a team aspiring to be champions required to give persuasive answers. The questions ranged from the elementary to the tricky. Could Liverpool\u2019s confidence really be so brittle that a narrow loss at City and a practically invited one at Wolves in the FA Cup would cause it to crumble despite half a season of domestic invincibility prior to that? Answer: No.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/12/liverpool-not-harlem-globetrotters-jurgen-klopp-brighton\">Liverpool are mature but \u2018not the Harlem Globetrotters\u2019, says Klopp</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What about their ability to cope with the pressure of a title race when their closest rivals have undoubted pedigree? Their response was positive. They will be asked it again over the remaining 16 matches of the campaign.</p> \n<p>And what of their depleted defence, which, owing to a spate of injuries, included the midfielder Fabinho here alongside Virgil van Dijk? When Trent Alexander-Arnold collapsed during the warm-up it looked like J\u00fcrgen Klopp would be forced into further improvisation but, after having his ankle strapped up, the right-back declared himself fit enough to play. He played well, as did Fabinho despite a lapse in the 15th minute that allowed Glenn Murray a free header from 12 yards. The striker sent his effort over the bar.</p> \n<p>That was Brighton\u2019s only chance in a first half when they spent most of the time entrenched behind the ball in a rigid 4-5-1 formation. This, then, was not a test of Liverpool\u2019s makeshift defence as much as of their creativity. They flunked it in the first period but never lost patience.</p> \n<p>Their play from the start was slow and predictable, almost entirely in front of the hosts. Many times this season there has been a disconnect between their defence and attack and usually Xherdan Shaqiri has helped bridge the gap, with Jordan Henderson and Georginio Wijnaldum industrious but not ingenious.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e9297d50-110b-471f-8ba7-1976d0765441\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NoXGkP0Wuno?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Shaqiri started in a role that allowed him to flit about but he struggled to get involved, although he did have the visitors\u2019 best chance in the first half, nodding wide from 10 yards after a cross from the right by Alexander-Arnold.</p> \n<p>Liverpool\u2019s full-backs were their most penetrative players, as Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Man\u00e9 tended to get bogged down in overly intricate moves in congested central areas.</p> \n<p>It would have been interesting to see at what stage Klopp might have varied the approach but, as it turned out, there was no need for him to do so because Brighton suddenly played into Liverpool\u2019s hands. A mistake by Martin Montoya early in the second half presented them with an opportunity to launch the sort of rapid counterattack at which they excel. Salah needed no second invitation, hurtling into the box and letting fly with a low shot that David Button did well to hold.</p> \n<p>Two minutes later, Pascal Gross made an even more costly blunder, oafishly fouling Salah in the box. \u201cI feel for Pascal because Salah is probably the most dangerous player when he gets into those situations,\u201d said Chris Hughton, who had no quibble with the decision to award a penalty. Salah\u2019s conversion left no room for doubt, either, the Egyptian ramming the spot-kick beyond Button and into the corner of the net to claim his 14th league goal of the season.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/12/burnley-fulham-premier-league-match-report\">Burnley fight back to beat Fulham without a shot on target</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The onus was on Brighton to vary their approach and subject Liverpool\u2019s defence to a more vigorous test. Hughton made a double substitution in the 65th minute in an effort to give his team more attacking impetus, though the hosts never committed fully to attack.</p> \n<p>\u201cBrighton defended like they defended because they knew that one mistake from us and they were back in the game and not making a mistake is difficult,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cBut we did it.\u201d</p> \n<p>With 20 minutes to go J\u00fcrgen Locadia cut in from the left to unload a 20-yard shot, possibly going wide, that Alisson pushed around the post. But that was as dangerous as Brighton got.</p> \n<p>Liverpool found more vibrancy as the game loosened up and had chances to make their lead more comfortable in the 75th minute but Button batted away his swerving long-range shot. Wijnaldum then flashed a low shot inches wide from the edge of the box after a nimble build-up involving Salah, who missed a much better chance in the 87th minute, dragging a shot wide from seven yards after a pull-back by James Milner.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure>",

It was a narrow victory but one that restores Liverpool\u2019s seven-point lead at the top of the Premier League and challenges City to close the gap again when they host Wolves . Defeats in their two previous matches led to this being billed as a particularly revealing interrogation of Liverpool, with a team aspiring to be champions required to give persuasive answers. The questions ranged from the elementary to the tricky. Could Liverpool\u2019s confidence really be so brittle that a narrow loss at City and a practically invited one at Wolves in the FA Cup would cause it to crumble despite half a season of domestic invincibility prior to that? Answer: No. What about their ability to cope with the pressure of a title race when their closest rivals have undoubted pedigree? Their response was positive. They will be asked it again over the remaining 16 matches of the campaign. And what of their depleted defence, which, owing to a spate of injuries, included the midfielder Fabinho here alongside Virgil van Dijk? When Trent Alexander-Arnold collapsed during the warm-up it looked like J\u00fcrgen Klopp would be forced into further improvisation but, after having his ankle strapped up, the right-back declared himself fit enough to play. He played well, as did Fabinho despite a lapse in the 15th minute that allowed Glenn Murray a free header from 12 yards. The striker sent his effort over the bar. That was Brighton\u2019s only chance in a first half when they spent most of the time entrenched behind the ball in a rigid 4-5-1 formation. This, then, was not a test of Liverpool\u2019s makeshift defence as much as of their creativity. They flunked it in the first period but never lost patience. Their play from the start was slow and predictable, almost entirely in front of the hosts. Many times this season there has been a disconnect between their defence and attack and usually Xherdan Shaqiri has helped bridge the gap, with Jordan Henderson and Georginio Wijnaldum industrious but not ingenious. Shaqiri started in a role that allowed him to flit about but he struggled to get involved, although he did have the visitors\u2019 best chance in the first half, nodding wide from 10 yards after a cross from the right by Alexander-Arnold. Liverpool\u2019s full-backs were their most penetrative players, as Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Man\u00e9 tended to get bogged down in overly intricate moves in congested central areas. It would have been interesting to see at what stage Klopp might have varied the approach but, as it turned out, there was no need for him to do so because Brighton suddenly played into Liverpool\u2019s hands. A mistake by Martin Montoya early in the second half presented them with an opportunity to launch the sort of rapid counterattack at which they excel. Salah needed no second invitation, hurtling into the box and letting fly with a low shot that David Button did well to hold. Two minutes later, Pascal Gross made an even more costly blunder, oafishly fouling Salah in the box. \u201cI feel for Pascal because Salah is probably the most dangerous player when he gets into those situations,\u201d said Chris Hughton, who had no quibble with the decision to award a penalty. Salah\u2019s conversion left no room for doubt, either, the Egyptian ramming the spot-kick beyond Button and into the corner of the net to claim his 14th league goal of the season. The onus was on Brighton to vary their approach and subject Liverpool\u2019s defence to a more vigorous test. Hughton made a double substitution in the 65th minute in an effort to give his team more attacking impetus, though the hosts never committed fully to attack. \u201cBrighton defended like they defended because they knew that one mistake from us and they were back in the game and not making a mistake is difficult,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cBut we did it.\u201d With 20 minutes to go J\u00fcrgen Locadia cut in from the left to unload a 20-yard shot, possibly going wide, that Alisson pushed around the post. But that was as dangerous as Brighton got. Liverpool found more vibrancy as the game loosened up and had chances to make their lead more comfortable in the 75th minute but Button batted away his swerving long-range shot. Wijnaldum then flashed a low shot inches wide from the edge of the box after a nimble build-up involving Salah, who missed a much better chance in the 87th minute, dragging a shot wide from seven yards after a pull-back by James Milner.",

If they had united, they might have had Brexit and nothing you or I said would have mattered a damn. Among the many failures of journalism in 2016, the greatest was the failure to explain that the enemies of the EU could never agree among themselves what version of Brexit Britain should follow.

Although we do not face state repression, the situation of the opposition in Britain is fraught in the extreme. American liberalism appears as fragmented as a smashed vase. At the end of last year, journalists counted almost <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/07/2020-presidential-candidates-955261\" title=\"\">40 challengers</a> competing to be the Democratic candidate to run against Trump in 2020. Yet, however divided they are, they are united in their opposition to Trump. Resistance to the right provides a stable point. Their counterparts in Britain must fight not only a right agitating for competing forms of Brexit that vary from the self-harming to the suicidal, but a Labour opposition that has abandoned its foundational duty to protect the working class and is willing to let it suffer the consequences of leaving the single market.</p> <p>The very intensity of a war on two fronts against an opposition that won\u2019t oppose and a government that can\u2019t govern will force through new ideas and new leaders. You can see it now, as politicians from the Greens and the Labour and Tory backbenches become more important than ministers and shadow ministers as they try to save what they can from the wreckage.</p> <p>It is for this reason, rather than because they have enough political baggage to fill a freight train, that Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson\u2019s attempt to lead the People\u2019s Vote campaign is doomed. They are not fighting in the arena against the Brexit right and far left simultaneously. They are not feeling the urgent need to develop new arguments and tactics that will eventually produce a new politics.</p> <p>Intellectuals like to believe that ideas emerge from a lecture hall and then converts struggle to implement them. More often, it\u2019s the other way round and the struggle produces ideas. The fatalism of those who in their despair think the best course is to opt out and let events unfurl misses that it is in the act of fighting back that the future will be shaped.</p> <p>\u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist</p>",

A \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d will not be popular with everyone. Millions of real people, including people who voted Remain, will say: \u201cWe\u2019ve already voted on this and even if we don\u2019t like it, we must accept the result.\u201d To which the best reply is the true reply that Brexit will have forced a second referendum on the British. Its supporters had it all in June 2016. They controlled the Conservative and Labour parties and had the popular mandate. Just as they are responsible for the near breakdown of government and the economic, diplomatic and constitutional crisis, so they will be responsible for a second referendum. If they had united, they might have had Brexit and nothing you or I said would have mattered a damn. Among the many failures of journalism in 2016, the greatest was the failure to explain that the enemies of the EU could never agree among themselves what version of Brexit Britain should follow. They never offered the public an exit plan and that dilettantish fool David Cameron failed to insist that the referendum spelt out what voting for Brexit meant. Today\u2019s breakdown flows from yesterday\u2019s infighting and indolence. With equal inevitability, the fight to protect Britain will generate new ways of thinking. Although we do not face state repression, the situation of the opposition in Britain is fraught in the extreme. American liberalism appears as fragmented as a smashed vase. At the end of last year, journalists counted almost 40 challengers competing to be the Democratic candidate to run against Trump in 2020. Yet, however divided they are, they are united in their opposition to Trump. Resistance to the right provides a stable point. Their counterparts in Britain must fight not only a right agitating for competing forms of Brexit that vary from the self-harming to the suicidal, but a Labour opposition that has abandoned its foundational duty to protect the working class and is willing to let it suffer the consequences of leaving the single market. The very intensity of a war on two fronts against an opposition that won\u2019t oppose and a government that can\u2019t govern will force through new ideas and new leaders. You can see it now, as politicians from the Greens and the Labour and Tory backbenches become more important than ministers and shadow ministers as they try to save what they can from the wreckage. It is for this reason, rather than because they have enough political baggage to fill a freight train, that Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson\u2019s attempt to lead the People\u2019s Vote campaign is doomed. They are not fighting in the arena against the Brexit right and far left simultaneously. They are not feeling the urgent need to develop new arguments and tactics that will eventually produce a new politics. Intellectuals like to believe that ideas emerge from a lecture hall and then converts struggle to implement them. More often, it\u2019s the other way round and the struggle produces ideas. The fatalism of those who in their despair think the best course is to opt out and let events unfurl misses that it is in the act of fighting back that the future will be shaped. \u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "Championship After Leeds \u2013 spying row and all \u2013 extended their lead on Friday night, a late equaliser from Norwich\u2019s Jordan Rhodes in a 1-1 draw at West Brom meant it was all change among the chasing pack. Sheffield United edged past QPR thanks to David McGoldrick\u2019s header, jumping into second place on goal difference, while Middlesbrough consolidated their position in the play-off places by negotiating a tricky trip to Birmingham, Britt Assombalonga\u2019s late winner clinching a 2-1 victory. After parting company with Aitor Karanka, Nottingham Forest lost ground on their competitors for the play-offs, Jack Robinson\u2019s farcical own goal capping nine-man Forest\u2019s grim afternoon at Reading \u2013 who recorded a much-needed first win under Jos\u00e9 Gomes. At the foot of the table, Ipswich got three vital points at home to imperilled Rotherham, Will Keane\u2019s early goal and a backs-to-the-wall second half delivering a glimmer of hope for Paul Lambert\u2019s side, who nonetheless remain seven points from safety.

A 20th goal of the season from John Marquis was not enough to keep Doncaster in the play-off spots, his side frittering away a 2-0 lead in the final 15 minutes at out-of-form Wycombe, for whom Paris Cowan-Hall scored his second of the game deep into stoppage-time to seal a remarkable 3-2 win. Barnsley \u2013 whose CEO Gauthier Ganaye has been linked with the job at Nice \u2013 kept themselves in fifth by sending Bradford away from Oakwell with a 2-0 defeat and their relegation fears deepened. Wimbledon are still mired to the bottom despite a hard-earned point at Coventry, their increasingly ominous situation not helped by the points picked up by Plymouth, who won 3-2 at Southend, and Oxford United, who battled back from two goals down in a 2-2 draw at Fleetwood. Bristol Rovers clambered out of the drop zone with a goalless draw at Accrington. League Two At the summit, Lincoln let their two-goal lead slip in an eventful 2-2 draw at Swindon.

      "body": "<p>Dua Lipa has become the most-nominated artist at the Brit awards for a second year in a row, underlining her status as one of the UK\u2019s biggest pop stars this decade.</p> <p>After being nominated for five awards in 2018 and winning two, for British female and British breakthrough artist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/15/dua-lipa-pop-has-to-be-fun-you-cant-get-upset-about-every-little-thing-new-rules\">the British-Kosovan singer</a> is nominated four times in 2019 \u2013 though admittedly just for two hit songs. IDGAF, taken from her self-titled debut album last year but still eligible for this year\u2019s awards, was nominated for British single and British video, with One Kiss, her summer smash hit with Scottish producer Calvin Harris, also nominated in the same categories.</p> <p>Her tally of four nominations is matched by 27-year-old pop singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/20/anne-marie-the-platinum-essex-pop-star-fighting-anxiety-and-body-shame\">Anne-Marie</a>, who as well as getting song and video nominations for her hit 2002 \u2013 co-written by Ed Sheeran \u2013 is also nominated in the more prestigious categories of British female and British album.</p> <p>Like Lipa, whose breakthrough came after a few years of fitful popularity, Essex-born Anne-Marie began guesting on dance tracks back in 2013, but she has steadily developed into a chart-dominating solo star. She sang the 2016 Christmas No 1, Rockabye, produced by Clean Bandit (the pop group who are nominated twice this year for their song Solo) and earned her first Brit nomination in 2017, for British breakthrough. Other major collaborative hits followed, including Friends with US EDM producer Marshmello, and she was nominated for her second Brit in 2018 for her song Ciao Adios. Her album Speak Your Mind became 2018\u2019s biggest-selling debut in the UK (though only the 26th highest seller overall).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4730ebbd618261faa6bfe9183ee93769e0ac0e3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4730ebbd618261faa6bfe9183ee93769e0ac0e3d/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Ezra, who has three Brit nominations in 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Ezra, who has three Brit nominations in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Smithies</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>George Ezra, whose album Staying at Tamara\u2019s was the second-biggest selling of 2018 after The Greatest Showman soundtrack, has three nominations, for British album, British male, and British single for Shotgun, which spent 12 weeks in the Top Three over the summer. As the only artist with one of the ten biggest-selling albums of the year in the male and album categories, his sheer success and cross-generational appeal means he will be a strong favourite to win both.</p> <p>Also with three nominations is versatile neo-soul singer Jorja Smith, who won the Critics\u2019 Choice award in 2018, as voted for by a panel of industry experts \u2013 this year\u2019s winner has already been announced as Tyneside singer-songwriter Sam Fender. Smith\u2019s debut album Lost &amp; Found is nominated for the British album award, and she also picks up nominations for British female and British breakthrough.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/20/anne-marie-the-platinum-essex-pop-star-fighting-anxiety-and-body-shame\">Anne-Marie: the platinum Essex pop star fighting anxiety and body shame</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The other nominees for British female are Florence + the Machine (another best album nominee), Lily Allen and Jess Glynne. The latter singer, who in 2018 became the British woman with the most chart-topping singles ever in the UK, picked up another nomination for her No 1 single I\u2019ll Be There. She also appears on the twice-nominated These Days by dance group Rudimental, but the nebulous rules defining lead and featured artists mean that she does not share their nomination.</p> <p>Guitar-pop group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/20/matt-healy-of-the-1975-im-not-scared-of-myself-any-more\">the 1975</a> scored two prominent nominations, for British group and British album, though Arctic Monkeys were snubbed in the latter category and only scored one nomination.</p> <p>A strong year for north American music, particularly rap, meant that only two of the 15 international category nominees were not from the US or Canada: First Aid Kit and Christine and the Queens. Rap superstars including Drake, Eminem, Travis Scott and Cardi B were all nominated \u2013 as was Jay-Z with wife Beyonc\u00e9 in the group category \u2013 but there was also room for cosmic jazz saxophonist Kamasi Washington.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8a3f617ba79de1e4b4b279fb4cc812436b76ae98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a3f617ba79de1e4b4b279fb4cc812436b76ae98/0_0_3568_5352/667.jpg\" alt=\"Jorja Smith, nominated three times, including for best album.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jorja Smith, nominated three times, including for best album.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a lineup dominated by major label talent like Lipa, Glynne, Ezra and Anne-Marie, there were some other interesting curveballs, including the 14-strong hip-hop boyband <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/26/brockhampton-14-boyband-men-colour-rap-sing-gay-pop\">Brockhampton</a>, nominated for best international group despite none of their songs ever reaching the UK Top 100.</p> <p>Impassioned Bristol punk group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/15/im-not-the-next-billy-bragg-on-the-road-with-idles-joe-talbot\">Idles</a> were nominated for British breakthrough alongside the poppier Mabel, Ella Mai, Tom Walker and Jorja Smith, while Cornish electronic experimentalist Aphex Twin was nominated alongside Ezra, Sam Smith, Craig David and Giggs for best British male, his fourth ever nomination.</p> <p>Perhaps disappointed to miss out in that category will be Calvin Harris, who topped the singles chart twice in 2018 and was rated by Forbes as the highest-earning DJ in the world for the sixth year running, though he does have two nominations for One Kiss with Lipa. Some of the year\u2019s other biggest selling album artists, including Take That, Rod Stewart, Post Malone and Michael Bubl\u00e9, all failed to secure a single nomination.</p> <p>The nominations are all drawn from votes by the Brits Academy, made up of industry and media figures \u2013 except for the best British singles, which are the 10 biggest selling of 2018, and the videos, which are the most viewed of 2018 on YouTube and Vevo.

      "bodyText": "Dua Lipa has become the most-nominated artist at the Brit awards for a second year in a row, underlining her status as one of the UK\u2019s biggest pop stars this decade. After being nominated for five awards in 2018 and winning two, for British female and British breakthrough artist, the British-Kosovan singer is nominated four times in 2019 \u2013 though admittedly just for two hit songs. IDGAF, taken from her self-titled debut album last year but still eligible for this year\u2019s awards, was nominated for British single and British video, with One Kiss, her summer smash hit with Scottish producer Calvin Harris, also nominated in the same categories. Her tally of four nominations is matched by 27-year-old pop singer Anne-Marie, who as well as getting song and video nominations for her hit 2002 \u2013 co-written by Ed Sheeran \u2013 is also nominated in the more prestigious categories of British female and British album. Like Lipa, whose breakthrough came after a few years of fitful popularity, Essex-born Anne-Marie began guesting on dance tracks back in 2013, but she has steadily developed into a chart-dominating solo star. She sang the 2016 Christmas No 1, Rockabye, produced by Clean Bandit (the pop group who are nominated twice this year for their song Solo) and earned her first Brit nomination in 2017, for British breakthrough. Other major collaborative hits followed, including Friends with US EDM producer Marshmello, and she was nominated for her second Brit in 2018 for her song Ciao Adios. Her album Speak Your Mind became 2018\u2019s biggest-selling debut in the UK (though only the 26th highest seller overall). George Ezra, whose album Staying at Tamara\u2019s was the second-biggest selling of 2018 after The Greatest Showman soundtrack, has three nominations, for British album, British male, and British single for Shotgun, which spent 12 weeks in the Top Three over the summer. As the only artist with one of the ten biggest-selling albums of the year in the male and album categories, his sheer success and cross-generational appeal means he will be a strong favourite to win both. Also with three nominations is versatile neo-soul singer Jorja Smith, who won the Critics\u2019 Choice award in 2018, as voted for by a panel of industry experts \u2013 this year\u2019s winner has already been announced as Tyneside singer-songwriter Sam Fender. Smith\u2019s debut album Lost &amp; Found is nominated for the British album award, and she also picks up nominations for British female and British breakthrough. The other nominees for British female are Florence + the Machine (another best album nominee), Lily Allen and Jess Glynne. The latter singer, who in 2018 became the British woman with the most chart-topping singles ever in the UK, picked up another nomination for her No 1 single I\u2019ll Be There. She also appears on the twice-nominated These Days by dance group Rudimental, but the nebulous rules defining lead and featured artists mean that she does not share their nomination. Guitar-pop group the 1975 scored two prominent nominations, for British group and British album, though Arctic Monkeys were snubbed in the latter category and only scored one nomination. A strong year for north American music, particularly rap, meant that only two of the 15 international category nominees were not from the US or Canada: First Aid Kit and Christine and the Queens. Rap superstars including Drake, Eminem, Travis Scott and Cardi B were all nominated \u2013 as was Jay-Z with wife Beyonc\u00e9 in the group category \u2013 but there was also room for cosmic jazz saxophonist Kamasi Washington. In a lineup dominated by major label talent like Lipa, Glynne, Ezra and Anne-Marie, there were some other interesting curveballs, including the 14-strong hip-hop boyband Brockhampton, nominated for best international group despite none of their songs ever reaching the UK Top 100. Impassioned Bristol punk group Idles were nominated for British breakthrough alongside the poppier Mabel, Ella Mai, Tom Walker and Jorja Smith, while Cornish electronic experimentalist Aphex Twin was nominated alongside Ezra, Sam Smith, Craig David and Giggs for best British male, his fourth ever nomination. Perhaps disappointed to miss out in that category will be Calvin Harris, who topped the singles chart twice in 2018 and was rated by Forbes as the highest-earning DJ in the world for the sixth year running, though he does have two nominations for One Kiss with Lipa. Some of the year\u2019s other biggest selling album artists, including Take That, Rod Stewart, Post Malone and Michael Bubl\u00e9, all failed to secure a single nomination. The nominations are all drawn from votes by the Brits Academy, made up of industry and media figures \u2013 except for the best British singles, which are the 10 biggest selling of 2018, and the videos, which are the most viewed of 2018 on YouTube and Vevo. The singles shortlist is then voted on by the Academy along with the rest of the awards, apart from the video award, which is voted for by the public.

      "body": "<p>\u2018Everything was too painful for Leon; he seemed too tender to be alive.\u201d His sister Ren\u00e9, however, is ambitious, resilient and destined to escape. Set in 1960s rural America, Paula Saunders\u2019s debut novel, <em>The Distance Home</em>, shows how two siblings, both with a gift for dancing, are set on paths of self-destruction and success by their parents. In a moving postscript, Saunders explains that the novel is based on her own troubled family history growing up in South Dakota. Today she lives in California and is married to the Booker prize-winning novelist George Saunders.</p> <p><strong>Why did you choose to write your story as a novel rather than as a straight</strong><strong>forward memoir? </strong><br>I found that giving myself some distance from the characters \u2013 who are, of course, based on the people in my family \u2013 allowed me to create situations and circumstances for them and explore their lives in ways I could never have felt comfortable doing in a memoir. Plus, by shaping the character of Ren\u00e9 (whose experience mirrors my own) and seeing her as separate from myself, I felt less guarded and more able to look into her motivations and feelings with empathy instead of blame. I did initially write the novel in first person from Ren\u00e9\u2019s point of view, but changing to third person was a critical step in my ability to understand these characters.</p> <p><strong>You write that you needed to be able to see your childhood from \u2018a perspective less tainted by personal pain and judgment and blame\u2019. How did it feel to revisit the past after all these years?</strong><br>First, it seems to me that the attempt to write honestly about people in your life who have been challenging for you forces you to try to understand what might have contributed to different aspects of their character, or what might have allowed for a certain situation to develop. The process automatically opens up some kind of deeper empathy for them as individuals.<br>Second, I think meditation practice helped me to calm down and stop blaming the people who appeared to be responsible for all the problems. It helped me to see that circumstances are not as solid as we might think, and that situations and relationships can be penetrated and changed through love and understanding.</p> <p><strong>This is an incredibly assured first novel. </strong><strong>What took you so long?</strong><br>I always thought I\u2019d be able to be a wife, a mother, and write books. Sounds easy enough, right? When our children were small, we had no money and no family nearby. There was a lot of work to do and not much room to pursue artistic ambitions. Though I did endeavor to continue writing during those years \u2013 turning to poetry because I felt I could go in and out of it more easily than prose \u2013 it took everything I had to try to create a family that I actually wanted to be a part of. Also, because the novel was based on my own experiences growing up, there was a lot to process in finding a path between my anger and the love I felt for everyone involved.</p> <p><strong>Were any writers or books particularly influential?</strong><br>I have always been fascinated by myths and fairytales, and I think <em>The Distance Home</em> has a strong element of both. The setup \u2013 a daughter idolised, a son reviled \u2013 seems reminiscent of a fairytale. Plus, reading Elena Ferrante was critical: her work seemed to grant me permission to write about my own dark and troubled family relationships, to see the exploration of our smaller, daily interactions and how they affect each of us, as valuable and worthwhile.</p> <p><strong>As a family epic, the novel reminds me of both Anne Tyler and Jonathan Franzen</strong><strong>. Were you conscious of writing in an American tradition?</strong><br>To me, this is a completely American story, especially because it\u2019s a story of division \u2013 of the haves and have-nots, the accepted and rejected. It seems that here, in America, we need to constantly identify an outsider, a threat. Where there isn\u2019t a natural enemy \u2013 or an evident other \u2013 we tend to create one to fulfil some requirement of our psyche and complete our expectations of the world. So this book \u2013 the story of one child preferred and one rejected \u2013 seems to hold a mirror to that larger psychology and to locate the beginning of that repeated pattern of division in the family. We might see in this book\u2019s family, as in our own, the immensely destructive power of our western ideas of winning and losing, success and failure.</p> <p><strong>There are several mentions of tensions and prejudices living alongside the Native American population. Was this something you were very conscious of as a child?</strong><br>Yes, there was an air of mild and continual racism in our house that I was always very aware of. Most of us now are attuned to the histories of oppressed peoples and the horrors we, as the dominant race, have inflicted and are inflicting on the disenfranchised. But when I was a child, there seemed to be the seeds of racist thought in the everyday language and attitudes, both at home and outside of it. My feeling is that the small, continual violences in our family and the lazy, casual racism pervading both our home and the culture at large emanated from the same source \u2013 from a need to identify an enemy, and a fear of losing whatever power and position one might have managed to secure.</p> <p><strong>I was particularly affected by the spitefulness with which the other girls treat Ren\u00e9 at school, just for daring to be different and ambitious. I\u2019m guessing this comes from first-hand experience?</strong><br>Yes. I think that when you grow up in a culture that values winning and success, your peers are not going to be so pleased to see you excel. Winning and losing is a zero-sum game. When someone starts to rise, it\u2019s a rational act of self-preservation for others to try to bring her down, because we all know the cost of being at the bottom. So to secure our place, we have to do battle with each other. This seems to be a lesson we learn very early on.</p> <p><strong>And, sorry, but I\u2019ve got to ask: how does it feel to be publishing your debut as the wife of one of America\u2019s most acclaimed writers?</strong><br>I\u2019m so happy for George\u2019s success. I was one of his first fans \u2013 before he\u2019d published more than a story or two in little magazines \u2013 and I\u2019ve always adored his work.

      "bodyText": "This article, Blood \u2013 and people just pass by, by William Millinship was published in the Observer on 21 January 1962. While terrorists continue to kill over 100 people a week in the streets of Algeria\u2019s main cities, French high officials sit in their heavily protected offices surrounded by a hostile European population, weighing their chances of maintaining even a semblance of public order. They have already lost control of the towns, and hesitate to use what force they have available to re-establish their authority for fear of provoking the crisis which they expect to come in any case. Trade has slumped, but the economy, they say, must be kept ticking over as long as possible, however slowly. Hence the decision not to impose martial law, and the lenient attitude of riot police toward European demonstrators here. Like children \u201cWe must treat them like children and pray that in the long run they will understand where their interests lie,\u201d an official explained. He admitted that he despaired of the Europeans ever recovering their sanity. In the meantime, the velvet glove allows the extreme right-wing Secret Army Organisation (OAS) to operate with impunity. In many ways it replaces the nominal authorities. Electricity workers stopped a strike here last night on OAS orders, before officials had time to take strike-breaking measures themselves. The walls of Oran are covered with OAS posters, slogans, mobilisation orders and portraits of ex-General Salan. No one bothers or dares to efface them. In the centre of town, the slogans \u201cThe OAS will conquer\u201d and \u201cOran likes Salan\u201d adorn a shoeshine stand run by European urchins. The local police, whether from fear or political conviction, prefer not to intervene in street troubles. They have done little to restrain the lynching parties that form quickly in this city, where violence is part of daily life In one of the main squares people walk with indifference over a large patch of dried blood which has been there for five days. \u201cSmash his camera\u201d In the Jewish quarter close to the square, a crowd of European adults yesterday attacked The Observer photographer, Stuart Heydinger. He was about to take a picture of a burning Muslim store set on fire in reprisal for the murder of a European in the same street that morning. A fireman had just been shot in the neck by an unknown sniper. There were troops and police on the scene, but no one moved against the small but ugly crowd around Heydinger. His film was torn out amid shouts of \u201csmash his camera.\u201d A policeman armed with a sub-machine gun looked on. A European of about 35 in a black jacket who had followed us out of the Jewish quarter warned me: \u201cIt is forbidden to take pictures.\u201d Violent hatred All that morning some 2,000 school children had paraded around the town shouting: \u201cprotect our schools\u201d and \u201cFrench Algeria.\u201d They were handled gently.

The Europeans nevertheless complained of victimisation. \u201cWe have people murdered every day, but all the police can do is search Europeans, when the Arabs are all armed.\u201d Earlier, an official in Algiers had told me he had hoped to avoid a large-scale clash between European and Arab crowds chiefly because the Muslims were not armed.

      "body": "<p>More than 400 years after her brutal slaying at the hands of her royal English cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots continues to mesmerise the captains and kings of Hollywood.</p> <p>Edinburgh will host the premiere of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/16/mary-queen-of-scots-review-saoirse-ronan-josie-rourke\" title=\"\">Mary Queen of Scots</a></em>, the eagerly anticipated latest screen adaptation of history\u2019s most turbulent queen. It stars <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/30/saoirse-ronan-mary-queen-of-scots-interview\" title=\"\">Saoirse Ronan as the ill-fated monarch</a> who combined exquisite gifts of statecraft with ruthless expediency to control and manipulate her court of perfidious noblemen. Margot Robbie plays Mary\u2019s cousin, Queen Elizabeth of England, and the film also features David Tennant and Guy Pearce.</p> <p>In post-Reformation Scotland Mary was reviled for her Catholic faith and for her sexual allure at a time when princesses were considered mere chattels and chess pieces to be paraded across the kingdoms of Europe to seal treaties and unite empires.</p> <p>The film-makers resisted the lure of a contrived Hollywood locution, as the title of the film bears witness to the universal fame of its subject. Not even the old Scottish warrior king, Robert the Bruce, was accorded such a distinction. Last year\u2019s Netflix extravaganza about him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/nov/10/netflix-scotland-outlaw-king-tourism\" title=\"\">was saddled with the melodramatic title </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/nov/10/netflix-scotland-outlaw-king-tourism\" title=\"\">Outlaw King</a></em>. Like Helen of Troy, another queen who toyed with the affections of great men, Mary\u2019s name alone needs no further embroidery. The ancient Spartan queen may have had a face that launched a thousand ships but Mary stirred the imaginations of a thousand Scottish radicals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"36d6cf9a2f727969b9a3460f6287d9e3a06af330\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36d6cf9a2f727969b9a3460f6287d9e3a06af330/0_156_2400_1439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katharine Hepburn in the 1936 RKO film Mary of Scotland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katharine Hepburn in the 1936 RKO film <em>Mary of Scotland.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The leftwing Scottish political commentator, Angela Haggerty, said: \u201cIt was always the thread of injustice in Scottish history that stuck with me. I was so enchanted by the story of Mary that I dressed up as her for Halloween, which I think is the ultimate mark of a child\u2019s respect. The year before that I\u2019d dressed up as John Lennon. Mary and Lennon were equally cool in my eyes.\u201d</p> <p>The story of Mary has also transfixed film-makers across Europe for more than a century.

      "bodyText": "More than 400 years after her brutal slaying at the hands of her royal English cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots continues to mesmerise the captains and kings of Hollywood. Edinburgh will host the premiere of Mary Queen of Scots, the eagerly anticipated latest screen adaptation of history\u2019s most turbulent queen. It stars Saoirse Ronan as the ill-fated monarch who combined exquisite gifts of statecraft with ruthless expediency to control and manipulate her court of perfidious noblemen. Margot Robbie plays Mary\u2019s cousin, Queen Elizabeth of England, and the film also features David Tennant and Guy Pearce. In post-Reformation Scotland Mary was reviled for her Catholic faith and for her sexual allure at a time when princesses were considered mere chattels and chess pieces to be paraded across the kingdoms of Europe to seal treaties and unite empires. The film-makers resisted the lure of a contrived Hollywood locution, as the title of the film bears witness to the universal fame of its subject. Not even the old Scottish warrior king, Robert the Bruce, was accorded such a distinction. Last year\u2019s Netflix extravaganza about him was saddled with the melodramatic title Outlaw King. Like Helen of Troy, another queen who toyed with the affections of great men, Mary\u2019s name alone needs no further embroidery. The ancient Spartan queen may have had a face that launched a thousand ships but Mary stirred the imaginations of a thousand Scottish radicals. The leftwing Scottish political commentator, Angela Haggerty, said: \u201cIt was always the thread of injustice in Scottish history that stuck with me. I was so enchanted by the story of Mary that I dressed up as her for Halloween, which I think is the ultimate mark of a child\u2019s respect. The year before that I\u2019d dressed up as John Lennon. Mary and Lennon were equally cool in my eyes.\u201d The story of Mary has also transfixed film-makers across Europe for more than a century. She has been played by Fay Compton, Vanessa Redgrave, Katharine Hepburn and Samantha Morton. In 1895, the short film The Execution of Mary Stuart depicted her death in such a realistic way that audiences believed the actor playing Mary had actually been beheaded. The drama of Mary\u2019s short reign and its ruthless denouement at the hands of a close blood relative has lent it a disproportionate significance in Scotland\u2019s history.

      "bodyText": "Neither side had anything to play for here and it showed. An amusing first half deteriorated into a mind-numbing second, where two of English rugby\u2019s fallen giants attempted to outdo each other in contriving ways not to win. And at the end the old inquest into where it has all gone wrong was given an airing. \u201cIt\u2019s the quality of the opposition,\u201d said Dai Young, Wasps\u2019 director of rugby. \u201cLook at Leinster. They\u2019re missing five Lions and they can still pick 15 internationals. I\u2019ve coached [in the Pro14] and you have two teams, one for your big games and one for the others. It\u2019s not my opinion, it\u2019s factual. You look at how many games they play, the English boys are asked to do a lot more than the Irish.\u201d Certainly fatigue was writ large across the endgame here. In the end it was entirely fitting that Rhys Priestland stepped up to kick the winning penalty after yet another innocuous offence at a scrum had invited him to the tee. Last-minute wins do not come much less inspiring than that. This was a shame because the match had started as the sort of nothing game that might incline the teams to express themselves. With both so hopelessly adrift, a good crowd could look forward, at least, to studying the form of various internationals who might hope to feature in the Six Nations. First up was Wales\u2019s Taulupe Faletau, returning after 13 weeks out with a broken arm.

It\u2019s the question every football fan has been asking for the last few months. Can Liverpool, after all this time, finally get their hands on it? One way or another, we\u2019ll find out today. Yes, if Liverpool fail to beat Brighton, they will become the new owners of the Premier League Crisis Baton\u2122. </p> <p>Our not entirely mature culture dictates that, at all times, at least one Premier League club must be in crisis. At the moment Huddersfield hold the baton of doom, but if Liverpool fail to win today \u2013 on the back of a despicable run of <em>two </em>straight defeats in all competitions \u2013 they will be the ones under scrutiny. To hell with nuance; to hell with the fact they played well at Manchester City, that the Wolves defeat meant very little, and that a draw or defeat at a Brighton side who are very good at home would not exacty represent the second coming of Devon Loch.</p> <p>Perception is often more important than reality in modern football, and that\u2019s why Liverpool need to keep the external mood as calm as possible for as long as possible. The football media in this country has the capacity to produce a blizzard of horse pucky so powerful as to affect even the most resilient, focussed group of players. Liverpool will have enough authentic, internal pressure to cope with as they get closer to their first title since 1990.</p> <p>All of which is to say that it\u2019s pretty important they win an awkward game at Brighton today. At the moment Liverpool are four points ahead of Manchester City; in other words, they have two lives, because they can afford to a lose game and still be in control of their own destiny. They\u2019ll want to keep that buffer for as long as possible, or better still increase it.</p> <p>There\u2019s every chance there will be a record points total for a runner-up this season, so draws will feel like defeats for Liverpool and City over the next few months.</p> <p>That game at the Amex is one of five 3pm kick-offs in the Premier League. The rest all involves clubs from the Premier League Second Division, including two meaty tussles between teams fighting to avoid relegation: Burnley v Fulham at Turf Moor, and Cardiff v Huddersfield at the Cardiff City Stadium in Cardiff. </p> <p>These are the fixtures:</p> <ul> <li>Brighton v Liverpool<br></li> <li>Burnley v Fulham<br></li> <li>Cardiff v Huddersfield<br></li> <li>Crystal Palace v Watford<br></li> <li>Leicester v Southampton<br></li> </ul> <p>There are some huge games in the Football League too, including <strong>West Brom v Norwich</strong> (Championship), <strong>Sunderland v Luton</strong> (League One) and <strong>Bury v Milton Keynes Dons</strong> (League Two).

I\u2019ll leave you in the tender hands of Scott Murray, who is following Chelsea v Newcastle. Goodnight! Crystal Palace 1-2 Watford Our last Premier League report has landed, and it\u2019s another tale of woe for poor old Roy. This afternoon\u2019s results mean Newcastle have dropped into the relegation places ahead of their match at Chelsea. You can follow that with Scott Murray. Leiceter 1-2 Southampton Stuart James\u2019s match report from the King Power Stadium has landed. And here\u2019s Ralph Hasenhuttl \u201cLongy was perfect today \u2013 he worked very hard and played a big part in both goals. We tried to be very compact in the second half but 50 minutes is a long time to be a man down. The players enjoyed the challenge. The longer the game went on, the more stable they were and that was the key to our success.\u201d Here\u2019s Jurgen \u201cIt was a hard-earned victory. It was a massive, massive game today - everyone knows how Brighton play, and so you have to be creative against a very organised side. I thought it was an unbelievable, mature performance of my side, and I like that because that\u2019s a new skill this season. We learned from the first half and the second half was much better. I like the performance \u2013 it was not an opera of football but it\u2019s still a really nice song. \u201cBrighton do really well. Chris [Hughton] is a smart fox and they close the spaces sreally well. It\u2019s difficult to stay 100 per cent concentrated when you have so much of the ball. It was a proper football game; we won it and I like that.\u201d More match reports! Match reports Paul Doyle was at the Amex Stadium to see Liverpool go seven points clear at the top of the Premier League. And Nick Miller\u2019s peepers were focussed on West Brom 1-1 Norwich. Crikey, that was a bit frenetic. You can check all the results across Britain and Europe by clicking here, but here are a few scores of note in the Football League: Championship Birmingham 1-2 Middlesbrough Brentford 3-1 Stoke West Brom 1-1 Norwich Wigan 3-0 Aston VIlla League One Burton 2-3 Gillingham Portsmouth 0-1 Blackpool Sunderland 1-1 Luton Wycombe 3-2 Doncaster League Two Bury 4-3 MK Dons Crewe 3-2 Newport Grimsby 0-2 Macclesfield Swindon 2-2 Lincoln \u201cThat feels like a massive win for Liverpool,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cThe title chasing teams that lost at home to Coventry or drew 4-4 against Arsenal or 3-3 at Palace probably wouldn\u2019t have had enough in the tank to win today. I think there\u2019s something different about these boys. Something that will probably ratchet up the heartbreak but still...\u201d Yes, if they don\u2019t win it, it\u2019ll surely be down to a lack of goals rather than the tragifarcical defending of old. (Unless Alisson and/or van Dijk suffer long-term injury, in which I\u2019m getting out the laughter track and the popcorn. Another terrific win for this admirable Watford side, who move up to seventh in the table. You\u2019ll like this department Burnley, who beat Fulham 2-1, had no shots on target. Both their goals were own goals. What a superb victory for Southampton, who had 10 men throughout the second half. Claude Puel\u2019s name may be appearing on a P45 in the next few days. Game of the season, end of. A big win for Burnley, who may be starting to extricate themselves from the malodorous stuff. Liverpool move seven points clear with a scruffy but deserved victory over Brighton! League Two: Bury 4-3 MK Dons (Adams 90) Oh my numbers! Bury, who were 3-1 down after 72 minutes, lead MK Dons 4-3! Brighton 0-1 Liverpool Four minutes of added time at Brighton. Jurgen Klopp is pacing around nervously. Championship Reading lead Nottingham Forest 2-0 (goals) and 11-9 (men). Cardiff 0-0 Huddersfield There\u2019s been one shot on target in the match. Brighton 0-1 Liverpool Salah misses a great chance to seal the match, inexplicably shooting wide from eight yards. A couple of important goals in the Championship: Birmingham 1-2 Middlesbrough (Assombalonga 82) West Brom 1-1 Norwich (Rhodes 83) \u201cSalah is a great player who scores plenty wonderful goals and will likely actually win some titles with Liverpool,\u201d says Phil Podolsky. \u201cFor the neutrals, however, Suarez\u2019s absurd genius for things like that goal v Newcastle may never be matched.\u201d That goal against Newcastle is one of the most disgusting things I\u2019ve ever seen on a football field. As things stand, Watford will move top of the Premier League Second Division, known colloquially as \u2018seventh place\u2019. Javi Gracia has done some job at Vicarage Road. Championship Adams has equalised for Birmingham at home to Middlesbrough, while Michael Jacobs has put Wigan 2-0 up at home to comatose giant Aston Villa. League Two: Bury 3-3 MK Dons Danny Mayor has equalised for Bury at Gigg Lane! Brighton 0-1 Liverpool Wijnaldum shoots just wide for Liverpool, who remain uncomfortably comfortable at Brighton. Cardiff 0-0 Huddersfield The referee Lee Mason gives Huddersfield a penalty for a foul on Hadergjonaj, then consults the assistant and changes his mind. We\u2019ll hear more about that, I\u2019m sure. The substitute Tom Cleverley has given Watford the lead at Selhurst Park. Crystal Palace 1-1 Watford James McArthur has missed a great chance for Palace. Meanwhile, in League One, Luton\u2019s Danny Hylton has been sent off at Sunderland. The score is still 1-1. Sir Alex Ferguson used to say that 1-0s win titles, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be thrilled with the score at Brighton. Liverpool still look comfortable in control of the game. \u201cPeak Suarez was absolutely unbelievable (ask Norwich!), and I hope Salah can step up to that level,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cI never loved him like I loved Torres, though. If Salah\u2019s goals do eventually deliver the league title, he\u2019ll be up there. But, there will probably always be a part of me wistfully looking towards Madrid...\u201d That\u2019s the thing. If Liverpool win the league, even Alberto Moreno will be immortal, so goodness knows what status Salah will have if his goals take them to the title. League One: Sunderland 1-1 Luton A James Collins penalty has brought Sunderland level in the big game at the Stadium of Light. Craig Cathcart has scored at both ends! He put Palace ahead with an own goal in the first half, and now he has equalised for Watford in the same goal. Brighton 0-1 Liverpool Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side are still in control of the game at the Amex Stadium. I was going to say they\u2019re comfortable, but I doubt anybody with even the most tenuous connection to Liverpool Football Club will be comfortable while the lead is only one goal. \u201cSpeaking of the 2013-14 Liverpool side, I haven\u2019t seen many, if any, comparisons being made between Salah and you know who, so I might as well make one only to angrily dismiss it as misplaced cause that\u2019s how everyone talks online these days,\u201d says Phil Podolsky. \u201cPeak Suarez is surely an impossible standard for a centre-forward, differences in the overall quality of the two teams aside.\u201d Yes, I wouldn\u2019t put Salah in Suarez\u2019s class yet. The next few months might change that, mind. Premier League It\u2019s still Cardiff 0-0 Huddersfield - and that\u2019s shots on target, never mind goals. Brighton 0-1 Liverpool Fabinho, the emergency centre-back, has made an excellent block to deny Pascal Gross. League Two Michael Doughty has pulled one back for Swindon at home to Lincoln, who are now down to nine men after Jason Shackell was sent off. It\u2019s Swindon 1-2 Lincoln. \u201cUpdate on the nerves for Ian Copestake,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cThey\u2019re slightly better after news of Salah\u2019s goal. BUT I have Gross in my fantasy team, so slightly bittersweet. Fantasy Football is incredibly effective at ruining football.\u201d Wilfred Ndidi has scored with his thigh to bring Leicester back in the game against 10-man Southampton. Claude Paul\u2019s employment status may depend on what happens in the next half an hour. League Two: Bury 1-3 MK Dons Yet another own goal, this time from Bury\u2019s Chris Stokes, means MK Dons have a two-goal cushion in the big League Two match at Gigg Lane. As you doubtless know, and therefore I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m bothering to tell you, a win would put Liverpool seven points clear of Manchester City, who plays at home to Wolves on Monday. \u201cNot quite a hat-trick of own goals but still very impressive: Chris Nicholl scored all four goals in 2-2 draw for Villa in 1976,\u201d says Joe Hunt in Melbourne. I remember it well. I mean, I don\u2019t remember it. \u201cClockwatch and Christine and the Queens through the headphones makes for a top Saturday afternoon,\u201d says Steve Horne. It\u2019s \u2018horny\u2019 football writing, that\u2019s why. The leaders are ahead! A brainless tackle by Pascal Gross on Mohamed Salah gives Liverpool a penalty - and Salah scores! Button almost kept it out, but he didn\u2019t, so there you are. Brighton 0-0 Liverpool The first shot on target of the match comes at the start of the second half, with Mo Salah drawing a decent save from David Button. \u201cFraude Puel,\u201d says Graham Randall. \u201cTad childish but time for him to go. Three defensive midfielders. At home. Not for me.\u201d France won Euro 2000 with three defensive midfielders at home, so maybe he\u2019s paying tribute. Half-time scores Premier League Brighton 0-0 Liverpool Burnley 2-1 Fulham Cardiff 0-0 Huddersfield Crystal Palace 1-0 Watford Leicester 0-2 Southampton Football League (selected games) Championship West Brom 1-0 Norwich Sheffield United 1-0 QPR League One Portsmouth 0-0 Blackpool Sunderland 1-0 Luton League Two Bury 1-2 MK Dons Swindon 0-2 Lincoln You can get all the latest scores across Britain and Europe by clicking here. \u201cDear Rob,\u201d says Jason Ali. \u201cRelated to the two own goals in the Burnley-Fulham match, has anyone scored an own-goal hat-trick (not deliberate)? The chances must be very low, but enough formally played games have occurred that it could have happened. Hopefully an \u2018anorak\u2019 will know the answer.\u201d That\u2019s the nicest thing anyone\u2019s ever said about me. Stan van den Buys is the hat-trick villain you seek. Southampton\u2019s ten men have doubled their lead! Another mistake from Mendy allows Shane Long to do what he does best. Okay, what he does every now and then: score a goal. There is some suggestion his shot was going wide until Kasper Schmeichel\u2019s touch diverted it on target, so that may be yet another Premier League own-goal today. Brighton 0-0 Liverpool It\u2019s half-time on the south coast, where Liverpool are struggling to break down Brighton\u2019s excellent defence. Southampton\u2019s young wing-back Yann Valery has been sent off for two yellow cards at Leicester. Southampton lead 1-0 in goals, Leicester lead 11-10 in men. Championship Sheffield United 1-0 QPR (McGoldrick 37) David McGoldrick has put Sheffield United into the lead at Bramall Lane, and as things stand they will move up to second. Championship: Birmingham 0-1 Middlesbrough Lewis Wing\u2019s calm finish has given Boro a deserved lead at St Andrew\u2019s. An almighty comedy scramble ends with a Craig Cathcart own goal giving Crystal Palace the lead. League Two: Bury 1-2 MK Dons (Lewington 36) Bury were level for approximately two minutes. Sol Campbell\u2019s Macclesfield now lead 2-0 at Grimsby. He is shutting a few people up, isn\u2019t he. League Two: Bury 1-1 MK Dons Bury\u2019s Jay O\u2019Shea, who missed a penalty earlier in the match, has equalised for from the spot against his old club. Championship There haven\u2019t been many goals so far: Brentford 2-1 Stoke Ipswich 1-0 Rotherham Reading 1-0 Nottingham Forest West Brom 1-0 Norwich The rest are goalless. \u201cHey Rob,\u201d says J.R. in Illinois. \u201cIn the \u2018unsurprising news\u2019 department Will Hughes has suffered a suspected concussion and is out of the game. This seemed to surprise Tony Gale though as he felt surely it should be up to the concussed player as to whether or not he stayed in the game. Hmmmm.\u201d What I love about Clockwatch is that it has revolutionised sports coverages \u2013 the readers tell the journalist what is happening rather than the other way round. Thank you, my Guardian! \u201cA very tasty battle developing between Murray (who is that type of player) and Fabinho who is not a defender,\u201d says Jeremy Dresner. \u201cBoth have elbowed each other in the face now.\u201d And why not? Brighton 0-0 Liverpool Saying which, Xherdan Shaqiri has headed just wide from Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s left-footed cross. Brighton 0-0 Liverpool Brighton are struggling to get the ball, never mind keep it, but their superb defensive organisation has kept Liverpool at arms length so far. Two own goals in three minutes! Denis Odoi heads past his own goalkeeper to give Burnley the lead. I wonder what Michael Proctor makes of it all. Jeff Hendrick\u2019s shot deflects off Joe Bryan and beats Sergio Rico. Burnley are level - and, as things stand, back out of the relegation zone. League One Chris Maguire has scored for Sunderland, who lead Luton 1-0 in the match between third and second. Or second and third if it stays like this. Burnley 0-1 Fulham Chris Wood has hit the post with a header for Burnley, who are coming back into the game after a difficult start. Brighton 0-0 Liverpool Glenn Murray has missed a decent chance for Brighton, heading Pascal Gross\u2019s cross over the bar from 12 yards. The latest scores in this afternoon\u2019s big games Premier League Brighton 0-0 Liverpool Burnley 0-1 Fulham Cardiff 0-0 Huddersfield Crystal Palace 0-0 Watford Leicester 0-1 Southampton Football League (selected games) Championship West Brom 1-0 Norwich Sheffield United 0-0 QPR League One Portsmouth 0-0 Blackpool Sunderland 0-0 Luton League Two Bury 0-1 MK Dons Swindon 0-0 Lincoln You can get all the latest scores across Britain and Europe by clicking here. Championship Dwight Gayle has made it West Brom 1-0 Norwich in the promotion clash at the Hawthorns. \u201cHey Rob,\u201d says JR in Illinois. \u201cWith every game available to watch I have chosen Palace v Watford. I\u2019m expecting a bloodbath and haven\u2019t been disappointed early on. Five seconds in Kouyate jumped and tried to hurt Deeney by embedding his knee into Deeney\u2019s back but ended up getting hurt himself because Deeney\u2019s arm caught him in the breadbasket. After 90 seconds of treatment Will Hughes was crunched to the ground by Sako. In the words of Mr. T, \u2018Prediction? Pain.\u2019\u201d Brighton 0-0 Liverpool Trent Alexander-Arnold is continuing and may be able to run off his ankle injury. Liverpool have had 88 per cent possession so far. James Ward-Prowse has given Southampton the lead from the penalty spot after Nampalys Mendy\u2019s needless foul on Shane Long. Jordan Moore-Taylor has given MK Dons the lead at Bury in the big League Two match. Meanwhile, Roberto Firmino has missed a good chance for Liverpool at Brighton. Since you asked: no, Schurrle\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t a volley. But it was a belter. Brighton 0-0 Liverpool So far Liverpool have had almost all of the ball at the Amex, though they haven\u2019t really got beyond Brighton. Brighton 0-0 Liverpool Trent Alexander-Arnold did start the game but he\u2019s struggling with an ankle problem and James Milner is warming up. Crystal Palace 0-0 Watford But Watford should be ahead - Deulofeu and Pereyra have hit the post in the same attack! Andre Schurrle has given Burnley Fulham an early lead with a scorching goal, smashed in off the underside of the bar! Brighton v Liverpool Trent Alexander-Arnold had an injury scare during the warm-up but it looks like he\u2019s going to start. Liverpool are already very short in defence, with Fabinho playing at centre back today. They do have good cover at right-back, though, with James Milner and Rafael Camacho on the bench. Not long until kick-off now. A win at Brighton would take Liverpool seven points clear at the top; a drew or defeat would not. \u201cTo be frank for a minute,\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201cdraws have been the new losses since everyone who is not United had unbeaten runs. I await a report from Matt Dony on the true state of a Liverpool fan\u2019s nerves. Yours, Frank.\u201d The early kick-off has finished West Ham 1-0 Arsenal. It was a deserved win for West Ham, who move up to eighth in the table.

An email! \u201cI agree with your nuanced take on my beloved Liverpool but the problem is until we break our Premier League duck it all just means a bit too much,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cIt\u2019s why in 2013-14 Gerrard ended up screaming like a maniac at his team mates to keep their nerve. It feels like Van Dijk and Salah have a little more ice in the veins so I remain optimistic yet terrified. Tell you what I\u2019d really enjoy, should it ever happen: a title race after we win the title. Losing your title virginity is nerve-racking and you can\u2019t really control yourself. But when you\u2019re having regular title races you can really relax and enjoy it.\u201d Trust me, you really can\u2019t. Okay, I suppose you can enjoy it, in the same way you can enjoy a visit to a malevolent drunk dentist if you\u2019re of a certain disposition, but I\u2019m not sure you can ever relax unless you are umpteen points ahead, in which case it isn\u2019t really a race at all. In the early game, Declan Rice has made it West Ham 1-0 Arsenal. Scott Murray has the latest. Some pre-team-news reading Hello. It\u2019s the question every football fan has been asking for the last few months. Can Liverpool, after all this time, finally get their hands on it? One way or another, we\u2019ll find out today. Yes, if Liverpool fail to beat Brighton, they will become the new owners of the Premier League Crisis Baton\u2122. Our not entirely mature culture dictates that, at all times, at least one Premier League club must be in crisis. At the moment Huddersfield hold the baton of doom, but if Liverpool fail to win today \u2013 on the back of a despicable run of two straight defeats in all competitions \u2013 they will be the ones under scrutiny. To hell with nuance; to hell with the fact they played well at Manchester City, that the Wolves defeat meant very little, and that a draw or defeat at a Brighton side who are very good at home would not exacty represent the second coming of Devon Loch. Perception is often more important than reality in modern football, and that\u2019s why Liverpool need to keep the external mood as calm as possible for as long as possible. The football media in this country has the capacity to produce a blizzard of horse pucky so powerful as to affect even the most resilient, focussed group of players. Liverpool will have enough authentic, internal pressure to cope with as they get closer to their first title since 1990. All of which is to say that it\u2019s pretty important they win an awkward game at Brighton today. At the moment Liverpool are four points ahead of Manchester City; in other words, they have two lives, because they can afford to a lose game and still be in control of their own destiny. They\u2019ll want to keep that buffer for as long as possible, or better still increase it. There\u2019s every chance there will be a record points total for a runner-up this season, so draws will feel like defeats for Liverpool and City over the next few months. That game at the Amex is one of five 3pm kick-offs in the Premier League. The rest all involves clubs from the Premier League Second Division, including two meaty tussles between teams fighting to avoid relegation: Burnley v Fulham at Turf Moor, and Cardiff v Huddersfield at the Cardiff City Stadium in Cardiff. These are the fixtures: Brighton v Liverpool Burnley v Fulham Cardiff v Huddersfield Crystal Palace v Watford Leicester v Southampton There are some huge games in the Football League too, including West Brom v Norwich (Championship), Sunderland v Luton (League One) and Bury v Milton Keynes Dons (League Two).

And completely relieved.\u201d</p> <p>Next year Searle plans to be in the centre of Antarctica sending a similar message. She is planning to break the <a href=\"https://explorersweb.com/2016/12/25/johanna-davidsson-set-new-world-record-2016-12-25-36744/\" title=\"\">women\u2019s world speed record for skiing solo to the south pole</a>, unassisted and unaided, with Rudd as her expedition leader. \u201cIt will be a <a href=\"https://southpole2020.com/#intro\" title=\"\">huge challenge</a> but I think everyone\u2019s got one big adventure in them.\u201d</p> <p>Searle will need to ski 702 miles across the frozen continent in less than 38 days, 23 hours and five minutes. \u201cI can\u2019t have any outside assistance and I have to take everything with me in a special sledge called a pulk: all my food, my fuel, my supplies, everything. I can\u2019t have any food resupplies or medical help. I cannot even accept a cup of tea,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be completely alone and, in all likelihood I won\u2019t see anybody else.\u201d</p> <p>Searle is 5ft 5in tall and weighs just over 60kg; the pulk will weigh over 80kg. As training for the expedition, she is spending more than 10 hours a week lifting weights and running up and down hills pulling a tyre, while also holding down a full-time job in the Ministry of Defence press office.</p> <p>Knowing how difficult and dangerous the trip is going to be forces Searle to prioritise it. \u201cWhen you know that, if you don\u2019t do your training, one day that might be the difference between success and failure, then it\u2019s a huge motivator.\u201d</p> <p>Her family \u2013 her husband is a soldier and they have three teenage daughters and a nine-year-old son \u2013 are doing all they can to support her. \u201cMy children are super-independent, and they do a lot of managing upwards. They\u2019ll say, \u2018don\u2019t forget parents evening and these are the appointments I\u2019ve got you\u2019. They\u2019re amazing.\u201d She is determined to show them that following your dreams is worth doing. \u201cI want my children to think: if you pursue things with a passion, you will achieve the results you want to. I want them to see that it\u2019s OK to pursue something with a white-hot passion in a single-minded way and focus on a goal.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72d32640fcf7743680f4e30a66bd5769a5922e20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72d32640fcf7743680f4e30a66bd5769a5922e20/0_0_7028_4685/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Searle was expedition leader for Louis Rudd\u2019s 925-mile solo trek across the Antarctic last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Searle was expedition leader for Louis Rudd\u2019s 925-mile solo trek across the Antarctic last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ren\u00e9 Koster Photography/Rene Koster</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Five years ago, Searle had never considered crossing the Antarctic. Then she managed the media campaign of an expedition to the south pole by a team of military personnel. \u201cI became hooked.\u201d</p> <p>She discovered the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Antarctica\" title=\"\">first woman hadn\u2019t set foot on Antarctica until 1935</a>, even though men had been going there for 100 years before that. It made her wonder if she could have a go herself. \u201cBeing around the pole community made it seem like a totally normal idea.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the fact that she\u2019d had no previous polar training and had never skied before, she successfully skied 350 miles across the Greenland ice sheet last year. \u201cOne thing I learned is that my polar expedition is going to be incredibly tough, mentally. I definitely missed my children.

      "bodyText": "When Louis Rudd crossed the finishing line of his 925-mile solo trek across Antarctica last month, the first person he contacted was Wendy Searle. \u201cI\u2019ve done it!!!!\u201d the army captain texted her. It was the news that the 41-year-old Searle, a Ministry of Defence civil servant and Rudd\u2019s expedition leader, had spent sleepless nights waiting for. \u201cI\u2019d known he was going to do it two or three days before but hearing he was there safely, that he had completed it as he\u2019d set out to \u2026 I was elated. And completely relieved.\u201d Next year Searle plans to be in the centre of Antarctica sending a similar message. She is planning to break the women\u2019s world speed record for skiing solo to the south pole, unassisted and unaided, with Rudd as her expedition leader. \u201cIt will be a huge challenge but I think everyone\u2019s got one big adventure in them.\u201d Searle will need to ski 702 miles across the frozen continent in less than 38 days, 23 hours and five minutes. \u201cI can\u2019t have any outside assistance and I have to take everything with me in a special sledge called a pulk: all my food, my fuel, my supplies, everything. I can\u2019t have any food resupplies or medical help. I cannot even accept a cup of tea,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be completely alone and, in all likelihood I won\u2019t see anybody else.\u201d Searle is 5ft 5in tall and weighs just over 60kg; the pulk will weigh over 80kg. As training for the expedition, she is spending more than 10 hours a week lifting weights and running up and down hills pulling a tyre, while also holding down a full-time job in the Ministry of Defence press office. Knowing how difficult and dangerous the trip is going to be forces Searle to prioritise it. \u201cWhen you know that, if you don\u2019t do your training, one day that might be the difference between success and failure, then it\u2019s a huge motivator.\u201d Her family \u2013 her husband is a soldier and they have three teenage daughters and a nine-year-old son \u2013 are doing all they can to support her. \u201cMy children are super-independent, and they do a lot of managing upwards. They\u2019ll say, \u2018don\u2019t forget parents evening and these are the appointments I\u2019ve got you\u2019. They\u2019re amazing.\u201d She is determined to show them that following your dreams is worth doing. \u201cI want my children to think: if you pursue things with a passion, you will achieve the results you want to. I want them to see that it\u2019s OK to pursue something with a white-hot passion in a single-minded way and focus on a goal.\u201d Five years ago, Searle had never considered crossing the Antarctic. Then she managed the media campaign of an expedition to the south pole by a team of military personnel. \u201cI became hooked.\u201d She discovered the first woman hadn\u2019t set foot on Antarctica until 1935, even though men had been going there for 100 years before that. It made her wonder if she could have a go herself. \u201cBeing around the pole community made it seem like a totally normal idea.\u201d Despite the fact that she\u2019d had no previous polar training and had never skied before, she successfully skied 350 miles across the Greenland ice sheet last year. \u201cOne thing I learned is that my polar expedition is going to be incredibly tough, mentally. I definitely missed my children. But all I could think at the time was: no one day has been as bad or is ever going to be as bad as the six months I spent pretty much on my own in Germany when I was 25. My husband was away fighting in Iraq, I had a house, a dog and three children under four I was solely responsible for, and six months of just absolutely relentless grinding tiredness.\u201d As a woman, she faces certain physical challenges. \u201cIf you\u2019re going for a pee in the Antarctic it is decidedly easier from a logistics point of view to be a guy. Periods are also a massive issue.\u201d She will take medication to stop herself menstruating. Training for her adventures has changed who she is as a person. \u201cDoing things that push me beyond what I thought I might be able to do, that has become a huge part of my life. I can\u2019t imagine not doing those things now.\u201d Searle is still raising money to fund the \u00a350,000 expedition and hopes to raise a further \u00a350,000 for charity.

      "bodyText": "For a game of such magnitude in the fight for survival, a bore draw was an unwelcome outcome for both parties yet Huddersfield left the Welsh capital aggrieved at what might have been. Lee Mason, the referee, awarded Huddersfield a penalty with 14 minutes to play after Joe Bennett brought down Florent Hadergjonaj. But when his assistant flagged to inform Mason that Hadergjonaj had in fact fouled Bennett, the referee reversed his decision. Cardiff may have failed to register a shot on target, or the win they craved, but Huddersfield look doomed. David Wagner\u2019s side face Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal in three of their next four games and this was a 10th consecutive match without victory. They are eight points adrift of safety while no team in Premier League history has avoided relegation after accumulating only 11 points by this stage of the season. It may be barely mid-January but both Wagner and Neil Warnock acknowledged the pain at passing up the chance to gain three points here. Huddersfield have been drinking in the last chance saloon for a while, arguably since November \u2013 when they last tasted victory \u2013 but Wagner fumed at the match officials for removing a lifeline in their battle against the drop. \u201cI have no clue what was in their heads in that moment,\u201d the manager said. \u201cI think they struggled to try to repair [the decision] what they have done. The whole situation makes absolutely no sense. I have seen the video footage and I have to say that it was a clear pen. \u201cIt would have been the clearest-cut chance of the whole game and they took it away from us. We will probably receive another phone call from the FA this week, where they will apologise for the referee\u2019s decision, but this doesn\u2019t help us.\u201d Huddersfield may have stopped the rot after nine consecutive defeats and probably shaded play, though both teams mustered only half-chances. Nathaniel Mendez-Laing was Cardiff\u2019s catalyst and, after skipping away from Erik Durm, he whipped a delicious ball into the box, where Junior Hoilett and Hadergjonaj collided. The latter did not appear to win the ball cleanly. \u201cI suppose you could say justice was done in that respect,\u201d Warnock said. Huddersfield have scored only 13 goals this season, the fewest in the division, and again came up short in the final third. Cardiff, too, were blunt in attack, with Warnock turning to Rhys Healey, fresh from a loan spell at MK Dons, midway through the second half.

      "bodyText": "The US government shutdown is now the longest such closure in history. On Sunday, day 23, members of Congress were out of Washington, Donald Trump was unmoved in the White House, his border wall unbuilt, and around 800,000 federal workers were still without pay and facing mounting hardship. From a White House he described as empty, Trump complained on Twitter about multiple reports in the press that his administration is in chaos, lacking a plan to end the impasse. \u201cI do have a plan on the Shutdown,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cBut to understand that plan you would have to understand the fact that I won the election, and I promised safety and security for the American people. Part of that promise was a Wall at the Southern Border. Elections have consequences!\u201d Trump added: \u201cWe will be out for a long time unless the Democrats come back from their \u2018vacations\u2019 and get back to work. I am in the White House ready to sign!\u201d Trump has however repeatedly pledged to veto legislation initially supported by both parties to reopen the government, without funding for his wall. Friday was the first payday of the year for federal workers and contractors affected by the closure, some at home, some forced to work. Some paychecks turned up blank. Contractors may not recoup lost earnings. As callouts rose among workers deemed essential, so did problems for government programmes, for courts, national parks and vital transport and infrastructure services including major airports. Even White House staffing is severely affected, prompting Trump to complain in a tweet: \u201cThere\u2019s almost nobody in the WH but me.\u201d On Saturday the shutdown passed the 21-day mark set when Bill Clinton faced a Republican Congress in 1995 and 1996. Nine of 15 cabinet-level departments were not funded. Earlier, Trump backed away from threats to declare a national emergency and build the wall with money appropriated from military, water management and disaster management funds, among other sources. \u201cWe want Congress to do its job,\u201d the president said in a discussion on border security at the White House. \u201cWhat we\u2019re not looking to do right now is national emergency.\u201d Nonetheless, Trump insisted he had the right to declare an emergency if he chose to, and continued to insist there was a crisis at the border. \u201cOther presidents have called national emergencies for lesser importance than this,\u201d he told Fox News in an interview on Saturday night. Democrats reject Trump\u2019s insistence there is a crisis and continue to prepare a response to an emergency declaration that would involve recourse to the courts. The impasse is over the $5.7bn needed for a wall on the border with Mexico that Trump promised on the campaign trail, saying Mexico would pay for it. Democrats who control the House are determined not to give it to him, whether or not \u2013 and most analysts say not \u2013 he is correct that savings from a new trade deal will mean Mexico pays after all. The White House has suggested building the wall with steel rather than concrete as a key concession. \u201cThis is where I ask the Democrats to come back to Washington and vote for money for the wall, the barrier,\u201d Trump said on Friday. \u201cWhatever you want to call it, it\u2019s OK with me. They can name it whatever, they can name it peaches.\u201d Democrats, who oppose any wall as a matter of principle, are not buying that. They point to polling that indicates support for their opposition to Trump on the wall and other immigration matters, and to remarks by Trump in December in which he said he would be proud to force a shutdown. In a statement on Saturday, the Connecticut Democratic senator Chris Murphy said \u201cthis was already the dumbest shutdown ever\u201d. \u201cThe only reason we are shut down is that President Trump wants it that way,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear about how we got here.

According to S&amp;P Global Ratings, meanwhile, the shutdown has cost the US economy $3.6bn, a toll that will exceed Trump\u2019s funding demand in two weeks\u2019 time.

A lot of the time when I went into rehab, the counsellors would ask me how old I felt, and I would say \u201cOh, 11 or 12.\u201d I wish that the things I\u2019m learning now, people could have told me about when I was 12.</p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t give back any of my experiences, even if I think a lot of them were unnecessary, but I just wish I had known some life lessons then \u2013 some of the things that I think are amazing but no one speaks about, like masturbation, and \u201cgirl crushes\u201d, which are really normal. I explored my sexuality and then thought I couldn\u2019t tell anybody; but shame is such a dangerous emotion, and so I want to write this book.</p> <p><strong>What would you have been if you hadn\u2019t become a journalist and author?</strong><br>I would probably have been dead. I\u2019m not saying \u201cpoor me\u201d \u2013 the reality is that I\u2019m fucking lucky. It\u2019s a miracle that I\u2019m here, given my self-destructive and addictive behaviour. The most important thing I have realised is that no one is better than anyone else. We are all fundamentally good and a bit flawed.

A lot of the time when I went into rehab, the counsellors would ask me how old I felt, and I would say \u201cOh, 11 or 12.\u201d I wish that the things I\u2019m learning now, people could have told me about when I was 12. I wouldn\u2019t give back any of my experiences, even if I think a lot of them were unnecessary, but I just wish I had known some life lessons then \u2013 some of the things that I think are amazing but no one speaks about, like masturbation, and \u201cgirl crushes\u201d, which are really normal. I explored my sexuality and then thought I couldn\u2019t tell anybody; but shame is such a dangerous emotion, and so I want to write this book. What would you have been if you hadn\u2019t become a journalist and author? I would probably have been dead. I\u2019m not saying \u201cpoor me\u201d \u2013 the reality is that I\u2019m fucking lucky. It\u2019s a miracle that I\u2019m here, given my self-destructive and addictive behaviour. The most important thing I have realised is that no one is better than anyone else. We are all fundamentally good and a bit flawed. I think that embracing your flaws is the closest you get to perfection. What are you reading? Educated by Tara Westover, which is fascinating; also Bonjour Tristesse by Fran\u00e7oise Sagan and The Lost Properties of Love by Sophie Ratcliffe. Since I got sober, reading has been a real joy for me, because before, I\u2019d get into bed drunk and then not be able to concentrate the next morning because of the hangover. Now I read! Do you read aloud to your daughter? What are her favourite books? Yes, we read to her a lot. We\u2019re reading her Michael Rosen\u2019s poems at the moment. She\u2019s five and has just learned to read, which is a joyous thing to watch her do. \u2022 Eat, Drink, Run by Bryony Gordon is published by Headline (\u00a37.99).

And this is where Edmund finally delivered on his gathering promise a year ago, when he overcame niggles he picked up in Brisbane to give Marin Cilic a decent argument in the semi-finals.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s always good just to come back,\u201d he said. \u201cYou remember leaving last year and how it ended and coming back where you did well and playing on certain courts. It is nice to come back. It certainly goes quickly.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the 12 months since, Edmund has climbed from 50 in the world to 14, with a few difficult moments along the way, his season finishing when his knee gave up on him at the Paris Masters in October. The trouble flared in Brisbane two weeks ago, forcing him to withdraw from the Sydney International last week. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot better than what it was,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been practising pretty much like my normal schedule. I\u2019m happy the way it\u2019s going and it\u2019s getting better. Things don\u2019t happen overnight, they take time to progress. You have to manage it very well. If it continues to [improve] then that\u2019s a good sign. I\u2019ll be fine to play. I\u2019ve been playing a lot of hours the last week.\u201d</p> \n<p>Edmund\u2019s coolness in a crisis has helped turn him into one of the most dangerous opponents on the Tour. He is not remotely concerned about defending his ranking points here, either. \u201cIt\u2019s a number on a sheet of paper. The worst that can happen is I lose and I go down a bunch of rankings. It definitely doesn\u2019t keep me awake at night.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"925d3cfc-48a4-4ba8-af29-8ca5633fd3f8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9K6ekKFLFjA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThis is a tough match, though. It\u2019s a bit weird because he\u2019s been out injured and you don\u2019t know how they are coming back. But he did well in Doha so you get a feeling that he is playing well. The way I\u2019ve been going with my fitness and continuing to get that better, I\u2019m pleased about. This year\u2019s so long, there\u2019s so many more opportunities after this tournament to do well.</p> \n<p>\u201cLast year after Australia it took a while until I won a match again, so there are always those sort of silver linings, you could say. Last year I drew [Kevin] Anderson, this year Berdych. They\u2019re tough matches but you can win them. You\u2019ve just not got to have many expectations.\u201d</p> \n<p>The nation does, though. For all that he manages his emotions in an entirely different way to Murray, he will feel those pressures on court. He is in the same quarter of the draw as Anderson, who opens against the Frenchman Adrian Mannarino. There are some quality obstacles in Edmund\u2019s section, including the world No 2, Rafa Nadal, whose first opponent is James Duckworth, who history might yet record as the last player to lose to Murray.</p> \n<p>Nadal, who has known Murray since they met as teenagers in Barcelona, on Saturdayjoined the chorus of commiseration for his friend\u2019s impending retirement. The Spaniard, the 2009 champion, had foot surgery last year, but declared: \u201cI feel good, otherwise I would not be here.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said of Murray: \u201cIt is very bad news. When you are going on court every day without a clear goal because you cannot move well, you have pain, then is the moment to take a decision. Probably he is fighting to keep going for a long time. If he doesn\u2019t feel that it can go better, probably he does the right thing for his mental health.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe will be a big loss for tennis, for the Tour, for the fans, even for his rivals. He has been part of a great rivalry between the best players for a long time, and a great competitor. But that\u2019s life. I know that tennis is not forever. I want to do it as long as I can.\u201d</p>",

It certainly goes quickly.\u201d In the 12 months since, Edmund has climbed from 50 in the world to 14, with a few difficult moments along the way, his season finishing when his knee gave up on him at the Paris Masters in October. The trouble flared in Brisbane two weeks ago, forcing him to withdraw from the Sydney International last week. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot better than what it was,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been practising pretty much like my normal schedule. I\u2019m happy the way it\u2019s going and it\u2019s getting better. Things don\u2019t happen overnight, they take time to progress. You have to manage it very well. If it continues to [improve] then that\u2019s a good sign. I\u2019ll be fine to play. I\u2019ve been playing a lot of hours the last week.\u201d Edmund\u2019s coolness in a crisis has helped turn him into one of the most dangerous opponents on the Tour. He is not remotely concerned about defending his ranking points here, either. \u201cIt\u2019s a number on a sheet of paper. The worst that can happen is I lose and I go down a bunch of rankings. It definitely doesn\u2019t keep me awake at night. \u201cThis is a tough match, though. It\u2019s a bit weird because he\u2019s been out injured and you don\u2019t know how they are coming back. But he did well in Doha so you get a feeling that he is playing well. The way I\u2019ve been going with my fitness and continuing to get that better, I\u2019m pleased about. This year\u2019s so long, there\u2019s so many more opportunities after this tournament to do well. \u201cLast year after Australia it took a while until I won a match again, so there are always those sort of silver linings, you could say. Last year I drew [Kevin] Anderson, this year Berdych. They\u2019re tough matches but you can win them. You\u2019ve just not got to have many expectations.\u201d The nation does, though. For all that he manages his emotions in an entirely different way to Murray, he will feel those pressures on court. He is in the same quarter of the draw as Anderson, who opens against the Frenchman Adrian Mannarino. There are some quality obstacles in Edmund\u2019s section, including the world No 2, Rafa Nadal, whose first opponent is James Duckworth, who history might yet record as the last player to lose to Murray. Nadal, who has known Murray since they met as teenagers in Barcelona, on Saturdayjoined the chorus of commiseration for his friend\u2019s impending retirement. The Spaniard, the 2009 champion, had foot surgery last year, but declared: \u201cI feel good, otherwise I would not be here.\u201d He said of Murray: \u201cIt is very bad news. When you are going on court every day without a clear goal because you cannot move well, you have pain, then is the moment to take a decision. Probably he is fighting to keep going for a long time. If he doesn\u2019t feel that it can go better, probably he does the right thing for his mental health. \u201cHe will be a big loss for tennis, for the Tour, for the fans, even for his rivals. He has been part of a great rivalry between the best players for a long time, and a great competitor. But that\u2019s life. I know that tennis is not forever. I want to do it as long as I can.\u201d",

She says he tried to kiss her and then force himself on her. Huxtable says Hodges made up the allegation after he spurned her advances. Mobile phone records show he was at her home for 26 minutes but he told police he was there for only 10. His browsing history reveals he has an interest in rape porn.</p> <p>I fiddle with a yellow label that says I\u2019m juror number 11. Except I\u2019m not really. The witnesses are actors, and we\u2019ve been watching their testimonies on tablets at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry. The case is fictional, but shared pretence is engaging and our deliberations become heated. </p> <p>The Justice Syndicate is part interactive play, part psychology experiment developed by audience-centric Newcastle theatre group <a href=\"https://www.fanshen.org.uk/\">FanSHEN</a> and Kris De Meyer, a neuroscientist at King\u2019s College London. It explores how we form and change opinions, our tendency to stick to initial instincts and how groups influence our views. De Meyer hopes that data gathered during the shows and their immersive nature will generate new insights into human decision-making.</p> <p>It\u2019s a subject we surely need to understand better. On Monday, protesters jostled and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/07/john-bercow-urges-police-to-do-more-after-nazi-taunts-against-anna-soubry\">yelled at Tory MP Anna Soubry</a> in Westminster, calling her a \u201cfascist\u201d and \u201cscum\u201d because of her pro-Remain stance. Across the Atlantic, divisions appeared to deepen still further as Donald Trump and leading Democrats traded insults over his demands for a wall on the Mexican border. The increasingly polarised and hostile nature of public discourse raises important questions. If humans have the capacity for reason, why do we make so many bad decisions? How come people cling to extreme or irrational views in the face of facts? And can psychological insights lead to better, more rational decisions?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a83def6b95ca90fc3bce17ee3bddb772691a6ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a83def6b95ca90fc3bce17ee3bddb772691a6ab/0_130_2702_1621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Sidney Lumet\u2019s 1957 courtroom drama 12 Angry Men, in which an individual (Henry Fonda) challenges the majority view.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Sidney Lumet\u2019s 1957 courtroom drama 12 Angry Men, in which an individual (Henry Fonda) challenges the majority view.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The starting point for many who grapple with these questions, including those behind The Justice Syndicate, is the work in the 1950s of American social psychologist Leon Festinger. Based on a basic human desire to be consistent, Festinger said we compare ourselves to others to evaluate our own opinions and abilities, and that those in groups with diverging opinions will either seek to move towards consensus, ostracise individuals with opposing views or form entrenched factions.</p> <p>He also outlined how, when humans hold contradictory ideas, or their actions conflict with their beliefs, they suffer a form of mental discomfort called cognitive dissonance. His PhD student Elliot Aronson fleshed this concept out, showing how this is especially likely to lead to poor decision-making when it concerns something that is important to our self-image. \u201cIf I see myself as someone who is smart, competent and kind, and you give me some information that I have done something foolish, immoral or hurtful, I have a choice,\u201d says US social psychologist Carol Tavris, co-author with Aronson of <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/mistakes-were-made-but-not-by-me-why-we-justify-foolish-beliefs-bad-decisions-and-hurtful-acts-9781780662657.html\" title=\"\">Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me)</a></em>. \u201cI can revise my view of myself, or I can dismiss the evidence. Most people take the least painful path and dismiss the evidence.\u201d</p> <p>These pressures can lead to confirmation bias \u2013 the tendency to pay attention only to information that confirms our existing beliefs. It is perhaps the best known of human biases. During the 1970s, Nobel prizewinning psychologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/13/thinking-fast-slow-daniel-kahneman\" title=\"\">Daniel Kahneman</a> outlined a series of other mental shortcuts that can lead us astray. The \u201cavailability heuristic\u201d, for example, may mistakenly convince us that car travel is safer than flying. A \u00a3100 pair of jeans might seem like a bargain if reduced from \u00a3200, even if they cost \u00a32 to make, thanks to the \u201canchoring effect\u201d. And the \u201crepresentativeness heuristic\u201d can mislead gamblers into thinking they are due a win following a string of statistically unrelated losses. Kahneman went on to outline how the brain uses rapid, intuitive processes to make some decisions and slow, more conscious and deliberative processes for others.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/18/daniel-kahneman-books-interview\">Daniel Kahneman: \u2018What would I eliminate if I had a\u00a0magic wand? Overconfidence\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some argue our cognitive biases only look strange if we see human reasoning individualistically. French cognitive psychologists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber argue in their 2017 book <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/enigma-of-reason.html\" title=\"\">The Enigma of Reason</a></em> that as highly social animals, we are deeply concerned with appearing to be wise, competent and trustworthy to others. Our reasoning capabilities therefore evolved not to reach the most logical solutions to problems but to help us argue our case and justify our positions. \u201cWe are constantly justifying ourselves and seeking to persuade others that we are the kind of person they want to cooperate with,\u201d says Mercier, of the Jean Nicod Institute in Paris. \u201cFrom this perspective, it makes no sense to hold on to arguments that contradict your point of view, but it does make sense to have a confirmation bias.\u201d</p> <p>In a 2015 study, Mercier asked participants to tackle a series of reasoning tasks, and provide justifications for their choices. When later asked to evaluate their own statements disguised as those of others, more than half disagreed with themselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ce5c5fbad13d9fda6a943554f9deb24052fbd31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ce5c5fbad13d9fda6a943554f9deb24052fbd31/0_129_3861_2317/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Kahneman, the psychologist who exposed how unconcious biases often shape our decision-making.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Kahneman, the psychologist who exposed how unconcious biases often shape our decision-making.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: unknown/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Political polarisation has been a hot topic since 2016, the year Britain voted to leave the EU and Donald Trump moved into the White House. De Meyer, however, has been tracking the phenomenon since George W Bush\u2019s narrow victory in the 2000 presidential election, through the rise of the Tea Party movement, anti-Barack Obama sentiment and the rumbling acrimony over climate change.</p> <p>Aware of the insights psychology had to offer, he and film-maker Sheila Marshall produced the 2016 documentary <em><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/ondemand/rightbetweenyourears\" title=\"\">Right Between Your Ears</a></em>, which featured American Christian radio host Harold Camping and his followers, who believed that God would gather up his chosen few and then destroy the Earth with huge earthquakes on 21 October, 2011. It captures the intensity of the cognitive dissonance suffered by believers, who had left their jobs and sold their homes, on realising the end had not in fact been nigh.</p> <p>There have been some 20 Justice Syndicate shows since early 2017. The software on which it runs also gathers research data, tracking how consistent participants are when asked three times during the piece which way they are leaning, and how long they view pieces of evidence for. An initial analysis of recent shows found that almost half of participants failed to change their initial leanings at all, despite the introduction of new evidence.</p> <p>\u201cIndividuals take very different views on what bits of information are important,\u201d says Joe McAlister, the computational artist who developed the software. \u201cIt\u2019s taught me that people have a lot of different and unusual biases, which is fascinating but also quite terrifying.\u201d The allegations of sexual assault made against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and US judge Brett Kavanaugh both affected Justice Syndicate debates and verdicts. McAlister says younger participants have focused more strongly on issues of consent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7df5cd7944a9303c827f19b6748d7627b4f475a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7df5cd7944a9303c827f19b6748d7627b4f475a/0_108_3823_2295/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters against US supreme court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters against US supreme court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J. Scott Applewhite/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recent failures to repeat experiments that support important concepts in psychology have led to a loss of confidence in the discipline. Some blamed the use of highly artificial decision-making tasks for this \u201creproducibility crisis\u201d. De Meyer believes interactive theatre can produce more realistic results. \u201cIt allows us to recreate something with a certain level of realism, and opens up doors to do psychological research in a new way that we couldn\u2019t do 20 years ago.\u201d</p> <p>Others seem to agree. In December, De Meyer and FanSHEN produced a new piece, commissioned by the Cabinet Office, to probe people\u2019s reactions to a national power grid failure. Work on a scenario about someone dying due to medical negligence will begin next month. De Meyer wants to use the format to study why people are more likely to blame those of different ethnic groups to themselves for errors.</p> <p>He also hopes his work can help explain rising political polarisation. Research by US thinktank the Pew Research Centre shows a growing gulf in the views of Republicans and Democrats on key topics such as race, the environment and the role of government. Another study shows Americans increasingly dislike or even loathe those who support the party they themselves oppose.</p> <p>Many blame social media for fanning the flames of division. \u201cThe way people use social media and select their own online news sources keeps them in their own little confirmation bias bubbles,\u201d says Tavris. \u201cTweets go viral when they really resonate with a group or really anger a group,\u201d says De Meyer. \u201cSocial media seems to be amplifying existing divisions and probably making them worse.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a8b1f2a3f9266f0e26ac5379c03f506fdf5eeed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a8b1f2a3f9266f0e26ac5379c03f506fdf5eeed/73_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Social media seems to be amplifying distinctions between groups of people in society.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Social media seems to be amplifying distinctions between groups of people in society.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Fanner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Psychology offers insights, both to individuals who want to make better decisions by learning about their own reasoning powers, and those seeking the secrets of persuading others.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt\u2019s her word against his,\u201d says a middle-aged male juror in thick-rimmed glasses. \u201cSomeone of his experience wouldn\u2019t do something so risky.\u201d A woman to my right says the defendant is probably guilty, but maybe not beyond reasonable doubt. \u201cBut why would she lie?\u201d asks another female juror. Eleven strangers and I are discussing whether renowned children\u2019s surgeon Simon Huxtable tried to rape Sally Hodges, the mother of a former patient. She says he tried to kiss her and then force himself on her. Huxtable says Hodges made up the allegation after he spurned her advances. Mobile phone records show he was at her home for 26 minutes but he told police he was there for only 10. His browsing history reveals he has an interest in rape porn. I fiddle with a yellow label that says I\u2019m juror number 11. Except I\u2019m not really. The witnesses are actors, and we\u2019ve been watching their testimonies on tablets at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry. The case is fictional, but shared pretence is engaging and our deliberations become heated. The Justice Syndicate is part interactive play, part psychology experiment developed by audience-centric Newcastle theatre group FanSHEN and Kris De Meyer, a neuroscientist at King\u2019s College London. It explores how we form and change opinions, our tendency to stick to initial instincts and how groups influence our views. De Meyer hopes that data gathered during the shows and their immersive nature will generate new insights into human decision-making. It\u2019s a subject we surely need to understand better. On Monday, protesters jostled and yelled at Tory MP Anna Soubry in Westminster, calling her a \u201cfascist\u201d and \u201cscum\u201d because of her pro-Remain stance. Across the Atlantic, divisions appeared to deepen still further as Donald Trump and leading Democrats traded insults over his demands for a wall on the Mexican border. The increasingly polarised and hostile nature of public discourse raises important questions. If humans have the capacity for reason, why do we make so many bad decisions? How come people cling to extreme or irrational views in the face of facts? And can psychological insights lead to better, more rational decisions? The starting point for many who grapple with these questions, including those behind The Justice Syndicate, is the work in the 1950s of American social psychologist Leon Festinger. Based on a basic human desire to be consistent, Festinger said we compare ourselves to others to evaluate our own opinions and abilities, and that those in groups with diverging opinions will either seek to move towards consensus, ostracise individuals with opposing views or form entrenched factions. He also outlined how, when humans hold contradictory ideas, or their actions conflict with their beliefs, they suffer a form of mental discomfort called cognitive dissonance. His PhD student Elliot Aronson fleshed this concept out, showing how this is especially likely to lead to poor decision-making when it concerns something that is important to our self-image. \u201cIf I see myself as someone who is smart, competent and kind, and you give me some information that I have done something foolish, immoral or hurtful, I have a choice,\u201d says US social psychologist Carol Tavris, co-author with Aronson of Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me). \u201cI can revise my view of myself, or I can dismiss the evidence. Most people take the least painful path and dismiss the evidence.\u201d These pressures can lead to confirmation bias \u2013 the tendency to pay attention only to information that confirms our existing beliefs. It is perhaps the best known of human biases. During the 1970s, Nobel prizewinning psychologist Daniel Kahneman outlined a series of other mental shortcuts that can lead us astray. The \u201cavailability heuristic\u201d, for example, may mistakenly convince us that car travel is safer than flying. A \u00a3100 pair of jeans might seem like a bargain if reduced from \u00a3200, even if they cost \u00a32 to make, thanks to the \u201canchoring effect\u201d. And the \u201crepresentativeness heuristic\u201d can mislead gamblers into thinking they are due a win following a string of statistically unrelated losses. Kahneman went on to outline how the brain uses rapid, intuitive processes to make some decisions and slow, more conscious and deliberative processes for others. Some argue our cognitive biases only look strange if we see human reasoning individualistically. French cognitive psychologists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber argue in their 2017 book The Enigma of Reason that as highly social animals, we are deeply concerned with appearing to be wise, competent and trustworthy to others. Our reasoning capabilities therefore evolved not to reach the most logical solutions to problems but to help us argue our case and justify our positions. \u201cWe are constantly justifying ourselves and seeking to persuade others that we are the kind of person they want to cooperate with,\u201d says Mercier, of the Jean Nicod Institute in Paris. \u201cFrom this perspective, it makes no sense to hold on to arguments that contradict your point of view, but it does make sense to have a confirmation bias.\u201d In a 2015 study, Mercier asked participants to tackle a series of reasoning tasks, and provide justifications for their choices. When later asked to evaluate their own statements disguised as those of others, more than half disagreed with themselves. Political polarisation has been a hot topic since 2016, the year Britain voted to leave the EU and Donald Trump moved into the White House. De Meyer, however, has been tracking the phenomenon since George W Bush\u2019s narrow victory in the 2000 presidential election, through the rise of the Tea Party movement, anti-Barack Obama sentiment and the rumbling acrimony over climate change. Aware of the insights psychology had to offer, he and film-maker Sheila Marshall produced the 2016 documentary Right Between Your Ears, which featured American Christian radio host Harold Camping and his followers, who believed that God would gather up his chosen few and then destroy the Earth with huge earthquakes on 21 October, 2011. It captures the intensity of the cognitive dissonance suffered by believers, who had left their jobs and sold their homes, on realising the end had not in fact been nigh. There have been some 20 Justice Syndicate shows since early 2017. The software on which it runs also gathers research data, tracking how consistent participants are when asked three times during the piece which way they are leaning, and how long they view pieces of evidence for. An initial analysis of recent shows found that almost half of participants failed to change their initial leanings at all, despite the introduction of new evidence. \u201cIndividuals take very different views on what bits of information are important,\u201d says Joe McAlister, the computational artist who developed the software. \u201cIt\u2019s taught me that people have a lot of different and unusual biases, which is fascinating but also quite terrifying.\u201d The allegations of sexual assault made against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and US judge Brett Kavanaugh both affected Justice Syndicate debates and verdicts. McAlister says younger participants have focused more strongly on issues of consent. Recent failures to repeat experiments that support important concepts in psychology have led to a loss of confidence in the discipline. Some blamed the use of highly artificial decision-making tasks for this \u201creproducibility crisis\u201d. De Meyer believes interactive theatre can produce more realistic results. \u201cIt allows us to recreate something with a certain level of realism, and opens up doors to do psychological research in a new way that we couldn\u2019t do 20 years ago.\u201d Others seem to agree. In December, De Meyer and FanSHEN produced a new piece, commissioned by the Cabinet Office, to probe people\u2019s reactions to a national power grid failure. Work on a scenario about someone dying due to medical negligence will begin next month. De Meyer wants to use the format to study why people are more likely to blame those of different ethnic groups to themselves for errors. He also hopes his work can help explain rising political polarisation. Research by US thinktank the Pew Research Centre shows a growing gulf in the views of Republicans and Democrats on key topics such as race, the environment and the role of government. Another study shows Americans increasingly dislike or even loathe those who support the party they themselves oppose. Many blame social media for fanning the flames of division. \u201cThe way people use social media and select their own online news sources keeps them in their own little confirmation bias bubbles,\u201d says Tavris. \u201cTweets go viral when they really resonate with a group or really anger a group,\u201d says De Meyer. \u201cSocial media seems to be amplifying existing divisions and probably making them worse.\u201d Psychology offers insights, both to individuals who want to make better decisions by learning about their own reasoning powers, and those seeking the secrets of persuading others. In a 2014 study, Mercier and colleagues found only 22% of participants could solve a reasoning task on their own, but when small groups discussed their thinking, this rose to 63%. \u201cIf people are reasoning on their own or only with people they agree with, nine times out of 10 they will stick to biased positions and you are going to get polarisation,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you take a group of people with some kind of common incentive but who disagree about something, then reason can help them get a better answer.\u201d Back in our mock jury room, and an initial show of hands reveals that, after hearing the evidence, we see Simon Huxtable as guilty by a slim majority or 7-5. \u201cShe was drunk and upset,\u201d argues juror number four, a young male. \u201cBut what would she have to do for people to believe her?\u201d asks a female jury member, who adds a not guilty verdict would send out the wrong message to other victims. \u201cHis sexual fantasies, however extreme, are irrelevant,\u201d says a male juror. \u201cWe need to focus on the facts of the case.\u201d Another vote shows that 10 minutes of discussion has shifted opinion to 7-5 for not guilty.

While the sunny aspect warms the interior, underfloor heating beneath the poured-concrete floor dispenses with the need for anything extraneous, such as radiators. Storage is also discreetly hidden, behind unobtrusive doors. \u201cThe house would have been harder to furnish without a lot of in-built storage space,\u201d says Gina. \u201cI wanted to buy furniture to enjoy, not for the purpose of storage.\u201d</p> <p>On deciding to leave behind their London life (Gina was a costume designer and advertising stylist), she and Andrew fixed on Dorset but they couldn\u2019t find anywhere affordable that they liked. Finally, with their elder son about to start school, they saw a magazine advertisement for a house in Rye with the beguiling name of Fairladies, which they bought. They had never been to Rye before and lovely though it was, Gina was keen to move further into \u201cthe middle of nowhere\u201d, fuelled by memories of visiting her granny on the Yorkshire Moors. One day, she found herself cycling up a dead-end track, following a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign. What she found was a 1950s farm bungalow: it was love at first sight \u2013 minus the house.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d574f3f624a54aa64954ae946909e841acf0358f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d574f3f624a54aa64954ae946909e841acf0358f/0_468_3744_4680/800.jpg\" alt=\"Upwardly mobile: a wooden ladder in the living area.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Upwardly mobile: a wooden ladder in the living area.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bruce Hemming</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After several years of overseeing the new build, Gina\u2019s family moved into their almost-finished house in 2011. A dark and pale, almost colourless, palette was chosen, allowing Gina\u2019s vintage and modern pieces to have a life of their own. This balance of neutrality and vitality runs through the double-height kitchen and sitting room, as well as the smaller rooms divided by a mezzanine floor. A cosy snug with a wood-burning stove and rush matting on the floor is closed off by a sliding wall painted in \u201cpost-modern mauve\u201d lime paint (from <a href=\"https://www.pure-original.com/\" title=\"\">Pure &amp; Original</a>), while the bedrooms and bathroom upstairs are also accessed via streamlined sliding doors.</p> <p>Every object is carefully considered in this family house, from the industrial lightbulb above the kitchen workbench to cushions that resemble abstract paintings. Living near the Cinque Ports town of Rye, Gina\u2019s interest is piqued by stories of sailors, fishing and stormy weather. A natural stylist, she is interested in folk tradition, whether utilitarian or romantic. Paintings of shipwrecks lean against the walls of the upstairs bathroom, along with a life-size antique knotted anchor, while giant woven fishing buoys loll in the boot room downstairs. A simple handrail of rope lines the steep stairwell.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eae79cb9568e987c718d08d05730f37af4ba491a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eae79cb9568e987c718d08d05730f37af4ba491a/721_154_4363_5451/800.jpg\" alt=\"Shower power: the bathroom, with typically clean lines and plain colours.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shower power: the bathroom, with typically clean lines and plain colours.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bruce Hemming</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rye and nearby Hastings are bursting with junk shops, but Gina is just as interested in new things that are well-made. She likes nothing better than to find a local woodsman who makes bread boards using a horse-drawn lathe in a forest clearing. Some are lined up in her kitchen. When she is particularly struck by a talented craftsperson or artist, she promotes their work, either through events at the house, or at fairs she organises at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2012/mar/30/great-dixter-exotic-christopher-lloyd\" title=\"\">Great Dixter</a>, the historic former home of the gardener and writer Christopher Lloyd, and beyond.</p> <p>Gina\u2019s eye for the authentic is connected with her own creative talent.

Storage is also discreetly hidden, behind unobtrusive doors. \u201cThe house would have been harder to furnish without a lot of in-built storage space,\u201d says Gina. \u201cI wanted to buy furniture to enjoy, not for the purpose of storage.\u201d On deciding to leave behind their London life (Gina was a costume designer and advertising stylist), she and Andrew fixed on Dorset but they couldn\u2019t find anywhere affordable that they liked. Finally, with their elder son about to start school, they saw a magazine advertisement for a house in Rye with the beguiling name of Fairladies, which they bought. They had never been to Rye before and lovely though it was, Gina was keen to move further into \u201cthe middle of nowhere\u201d, fuelled by memories of visiting her granny on the Yorkshire Moors. One day, she found herself cycling up a dead-end track, following a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign. What she found was a 1950s farm bungalow: it was love at first sight \u2013 minus the house. After several years of overseeing the new build, Gina\u2019s family moved into their almost-finished house in 2011. A dark and pale, almost colourless, palette was chosen, allowing Gina\u2019s vintage and modern pieces to have a life of their own. This balance of neutrality and vitality runs through the double-height kitchen and sitting room, as well as the smaller rooms divided by a mezzanine floor. A cosy snug with a wood-burning stove and rush matting on the floor is closed off by a sliding wall painted in \u201cpost-modern mauve\u201d lime paint (from Pure &amp; Original), while the bedrooms and bathroom upstairs are also accessed via streamlined sliding doors. Every object is carefully considered in this family house, from the industrial lightbulb above the kitchen workbench to cushions that resemble abstract paintings. Living near the Cinque Ports town of Rye, Gina\u2019s interest is piqued by stories of sailors, fishing and stormy weather. A natural stylist, she is interested in folk tradition, whether utilitarian or romantic. Paintings of shipwrecks lean against the walls of the upstairs bathroom, along with a life-size antique knotted anchor, while giant woven fishing buoys loll in the boot room downstairs. A simple handrail of rope lines the steep stairwell. Rye and nearby Hastings are bursting with junk shops, but Gina is just as interested in new things that are well-made. She likes nothing better than to find a local woodsman who makes bread boards using a horse-drawn lathe in a forest clearing. Some are lined up in her kitchen. When she is particularly struck by a talented craftsperson or artist, she promotes their work, either through events at the house, or at fairs she organises at Great Dixter, the historic former home of the gardener and writer Christopher Lloyd, and beyond. Gina\u2019s eye for the authentic is connected with her own creative talent. She thinks nothing of felting fingerless gloves from wool spun on the Kent Marshes, or knitting medieval-style slipper socks that might have found favour with King John. She co-hosts foraging or basketry workshops, and hires out the house for photography and film shoots. Whoever is lucky enough to visit, a welcoming modern rustic aesthetic awaits. folkathome.com To find discount codes for Overstock and other homewares brands, visit discountcode.theguardian.com/us",

Like so many communities across the north of England, a decade of austerity topped off with the rollout of universal credit has hit Byker and many parts of Newcastle hard. Just two months ago, the UN\u2019s Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty, Philip Alston, was in the city hearing stories of desperation and deprivation and spending time at the country\u2019s busiest food bank in the city\u2019s west end. His visit came as no great surprise: a fifth of Newcastle\u2019s population live in the most deprived 10% of wards in England and Wales, and child poverty is 50% higher than the national average. But as help from the local authority has been withdrawn as a result of cuts in government funding, projects across the city are springing up, both to help meet basic needs and also to rekindle the sense of community that so many working-class areas hold dear.

An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/30/china-slowing-economy-and-inequality-force-new-priorities-for-rulers\" title=\"\">expected Chinese economic slowdown</a> means that the engine of growth on which some companies have become reliant risks stalling. At the same time, President Trump\u2019s apparent willingness to engage in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/05/china-economy-slowdown-us-tariffs-trade-war\" title=\"\">bruising trade wars with Beijing</a> offers yet another hazard for the industry.</p> <p>But it is the long-term structural issues that cast the longest shadows. Electrification, autonomous vehicle development and the threat posed by ride-hailing services to personal vehicle sales pose challenges that not all companies will be able to meet.</p> <p>According to Williams, the industry has seen nothing like this since Henry Ford\u2019s Model T rolled off the production line in 1908. \u201cIn that [following] period, the US industry defined the idea of the people\u2019s car \u2013 an internal combustion engine with a gearbox and so on,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened after world war two was that the Europeans and Japanese downsized the model. But European cars like the VW Beetle, the Fiat 500, the Mini, would all have been recognised by Henry Ford. The real big thing is that the car, as Ford and General Motors invented it, is going to be reinvented with electrification and autonomy.\u201d</p> <p>As if to underscore this tectonic shift, major European brands including Audi, JLR, Mercedes-Benz and Mini have all dropped out of the Detroit show this year, turning their noses up at the city that gave birth to the industry.</p> <p>From next year, the show will move to summer, perhaps mindful that the gala unveiling of shiny new models inside cavernous buildings protecting delegates from the Michigan cold is losing its lustre.</p> <p>But the seasonal switch is unlikely to be enough to restore Detroit\u2019s former glory, particularly with Silicon Valley becoming just as important to the industry\u2019s future direction.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not at all clear that manufacturers whose expertise is in petrol and diesel vehicles are well placed to benefit from electric and autonomous vehicles,\u201d said Williams. \u201cThe likely beneficiaries are the data companies, like Google, or mobility providers like Uber.\u201d</p> <p>Several carmakers have already cosied up to the tech giants as an insurance policy against a future in which personal vehicles take a back seat to a broader range of transport options. Toyota, the world\u2019s largest carmaker by vehicle production, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/28/toyota-to-invest-500m-in-uber-for-self-driving-car-programme\" title=\"\">poured $500m into a driverless car partnership with Uber</a>, while Volvo also has a partnership with the company and JLR has unveiled a long-term tie-up with Waymo, part of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1838257639b4f3527bb161ac936a486d95999511\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1838257639b4f3527bb161ac936a486d95999511/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toyota car at a motor show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toyota has formed a technology partnership with Uber.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Marcus/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Driverless technology is not without its problems, including several fatal accidents. Polling, at least in the US, shows most drivers don\u2019t yet trust autonomous cars, with <a href=\"https://newsroom.aaa.com/2018/05/aaa-american-trust-autonomous-vehicles-slips/\" title=\"\">73% of American drivers</a> saying they would be too afraid to ride in a fully self-driving vehicle.</p> <p>That may create nagging doubts for an industry spending billions on robot vehicles, particularly given that investment is all the harder to sustain when sales of traditional vehicles are not holding up well. But most pundits are in little doubt about the ultimate direction of travel. Analysts at Citigroup think autonomous features will be standard in personal vehicles in the early 2020s, with services diversifying after that to include autonomous vehicle (AV) subscriptions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA lease payment for an AV subscriber would include use of the car plus insurance and maintenance,\u201d the analysts write. \u201cIn addition to extra AV safety features on this car, the car will drive itself to get services in the middle of the night, or a new car with enough seats to pick up the whole family at the airport can be sent to your house overnight.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, Citigroup\u2019s analysts envisage a global \u201cRobotaxi\u201d market with an enterprise value of some $1tn.</p> <p>Autonomous or not, the cars of the future will be powered by electricity. This poses yet another existential threat to industry players that do not manage the change well.</p> <p>\u201cChina will become the centre for global electric vehicle production,\u201d said Bailey. \u201cUnless the industry transforms, large chunks of it could get wiped out. Renault-Nissan are well ahead and BMW has invested very heavily, then you have Tesla as a new entrant and firms such as JLR catching up.</p> <p>\u201cThose that are really lagging are companies such as Ford, which is well behind and is going into collaboration with Volkswagen, who are having to reorientate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/21/dieselgate-uk-car-industry-sales-slump\" title=\"\">in the wake of Dieselgate</a>.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "As motor industry executives descend on Detroit this week for its annual motor show, the icy winds sweeping in off the Great Lakes will not be the only thing sending a sub-zero chill through their bones. The 2019 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS), to give it its proper title, returns to the Motor City on Monday at what many believe is the most pivotal \u2013 and perhaps the most dangerous \u2013 period in the car industry\u2019s history. Experts are not mincing their words. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be more change in the next 15 to 20 years than in the last 100 years,\u201d said Prof David Bailey of Aston University. According to Prof Karel Williams of the Manchester Business School: \u201cThe car as we know it may be on the edge of becoming history, the way that [photographic company] Kodak became history.\u201d Predictions aside, there is abundant evidence of a looming crisis. Around \u00a3100bn was wiped off the value of car firms last year, with the pain felt on production lines and in boardrooms around the world. Last November, Detroit-based General Motors announced it was shedding 14,700 jobs and closing plants as it deals with flagging sales of saloon cars in a US market that many expect to slow in 2019 and 2020. Only last week, Britain\u2019s largest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, announced 4,500 job cuts, citing weakening demand in China and sliding diesel-vehicle sales in the wake of the Dieselgate emissions-rigging scandal. The spectre of a no-deal Brexit also hangs over JLR and several other manufacturers with major operations in the UK. On the same day as JLR\u2019s announcement, Ford revealed it would be scaling down its European operations dramatically, having unwisely overexpanded. The cuts are expected to include 1,000 job losses in Bridgend \u2013 more than half the workforce at the carmaker\u2019s engine factory in Wales. Other, less structural, issues have further shaken the industry. The death of lionised former Fiat boss Sergio Marchionne piled personal grief on top of professional gloom in 2018. And when the head of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Carlos Ghosn, was arrested in Japan and charged with financial misconduct offences \u2013 which he denies \u2013 it showed that even a figure seen as superhuman in some circles could be suddenly toppled. There could be more pain to follow \u2013 and in short order. An expected Chinese economic slowdown means that the engine of growth on which some companies have become reliant risks stalling. At the same time, President Trump\u2019s apparent willingness to engage in bruising trade wars with Beijing offers yet another hazard for the industry. But it is the long-term structural issues that cast the longest shadows. Electrification, autonomous vehicle development and the threat posed by ride-hailing services to personal vehicle sales pose challenges that not all companies will be able to meet. According to Williams, the industry has seen nothing like this since Henry Ford\u2019s Model T rolled off the production line in 1908. \u201cIn that [following] period, the US industry defined the idea of the people\u2019s car \u2013 an internal combustion engine with a gearbox and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happened after world war two was that the Europeans and Japanese downsized the model. But European cars like the VW Beetle, the Fiat 500, the Mini, would all have been recognised by Henry Ford. The real big thing is that the car, as Ford and General Motors invented it, is going to be reinvented with electrification and autonomy.\u201d As if to underscore this tectonic shift, major European brands including Audi, JLR, Mercedes-Benz and Mini have all dropped out of the Detroit show this year, turning their noses up at the city that gave birth to the industry. From next year, the show will move to summer, perhaps mindful that the gala unveiling of shiny new models inside cavernous buildings protecting delegates from the Michigan cold is losing its lustre. But the seasonal switch is unlikely to be enough to restore Detroit\u2019s former glory, particularly with Silicon Valley becoming just as important to the industry\u2019s future direction. \u201cIt\u2019s not at all clear that manufacturers whose expertise is in petrol and diesel vehicles are well placed to benefit from electric and autonomous vehicles,\u201d said Williams. \u201cThe likely beneficiaries are the data companies, like Google, or mobility providers like Uber.\u201d Several carmakers have already cosied up to the tech giants as an insurance policy against a future in which personal vehicles take a back seat to a broader range of transport options. Toyota, the world\u2019s largest carmaker by vehicle production, has poured $500m into a driverless car partnership with Uber, while Volvo also has a partnership with the company and JLR has unveiled a long-term tie-up with Waymo, part of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. Driverless technology is not without its problems, including several fatal accidents. Polling, at least in the US, shows most drivers don\u2019t yet trust autonomous cars, with 73% of American drivers saying they would be too afraid to ride in a fully self-driving vehicle. That may create nagging doubts for an industry spending billions on robot vehicles, particularly given that investment is all the harder to sustain when sales of traditional vehicles are not holding up well. But most pundits are in little doubt about the ultimate direction of travel. Analysts at Citigroup think autonomous features will be standard in personal vehicles in the early 2020s, with services diversifying after that to include autonomous vehicle (AV) subscriptions. \u201cA lease payment for an AV subscriber would include use of the car plus insurance and maintenance,\u201d the analysts write. \u201cIn addition to extra AV safety features on this car, the car will drive itself to get services in the middle of the night, or a new car with enough seats to pick up the whole family at the airport can be sent to your house overnight.\u201d Ultimately, Citigroup\u2019s analysts envisage a global \u201cRobotaxi\u201d market with an enterprise value of some $1tn. Autonomous or not, the cars of the future will be powered by electricity. This poses yet another existential threat to industry players that do not manage the change well. \u201cChina will become the centre for global electric vehicle production,\u201d said Bailey. \u201cUnless the industry transforms, large chunks of it could get wiped out. Renault-Nissan are well ahead and BMW has invested very heavily, then you have Tesla as a new entrant and firms such as JLR catching up. \u201cThose that are really lagging are companies such as Ford, which is well behind and is going into collaboration with Volkswagen, who are having to reorientate in the wake of Dieselgate.\u201d",

Citing unnamed former law enforcement officials, the paper reported on Friday that in the days after the president fired FBI director James Comey, law enforcement officials were so worried about his behavior that they began investigating whether the president was working against US interests and on behalf of Moscow. Counterintelligence investigators were reportedly considering whether Trump\u2019s actions constituted a national security threat, an extraordinary line of inquiry against a sitting president. They also sought to determine whether the president was knowingly working for Russia, the report said. Trump responded on Saturday morning with a volley of tweets which did not question the Times\u2019 reporting but lambasted \u201cthe corrupt former leaders of the FBI\u201d for opening an investigation \u201cfor no reason &amp; with no proof\u201d. \u201cFunny thing about James Comey,\u201d Trump said. \u201cEverybody wanted him fired, Republican and Democrat alike. My firing of James Comey was a great day for America. He was a Crooked Cop.\u201d Of the leaders who opened the investigation, Trump claimed without offering evidence that \u201calmost all [were] fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons\u201d.

Comey, who last year published a bestselling memoir and has become a strident critic of Trump, responded on Twitter on Saturday. \u201cI ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made,\u201d he wrote, slightly misquoting Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who actually said \u201cMy friends, judge me by the enemies I have made\u201d in a speech in Portland, Oregon in September 1932. FDR's words are familiar in political circles. Six years ago, when he was still a property mogul and reality TV star, Trump tweeted them himself. On Friday, responding to the Times story, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement: \u201cJames Comey was fired because he\u2019s a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. McCabe, who was fired just short of retirement in March last year, will publish his own book next month. Trump mentioned all four of his FBI b\u00eates noires in another Saturday tweet. Sanders continued: \u201cUnlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia.\u201d Trump echoed those sentiments on Saturday. Rudolph Giuliani, one of Trump\u2019s attorneys, also sought to downplay the significance of the FBI investigation, telling the Times: \u201cThe fact that it goes back a year and a half and nothing came of it that showed a breach of national security means they found nothing.\u201d In an interview with CBS Face the Nation due to be broadcast on Sunday, secretary of state Mike Pompeo, director of the CIA at the time of the Comey firing, said the Times report was \u201csilly on its face and not worthy of a response\u201d.

Mueller took over the FBI counterintelligence investigation, the Times reported, just days after it was first opened. FBI spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The report may also raise new questions for congressional investigators looking into Russian meddling. Newly in control of the House of Representatives, Democrats have vowed to further scrutinize Trump\u2019s Russia ties.",

      "body": "<p>Casey Gerald knew he was special from a young age. Not in a conceited or entitled way \u2013 being poor, black, gay, \u201ca damn near orphan\u201d, and from the wrong side of Dallas meant he would often be told otherwise \u2013 but special because his mother insisted he was. \u201cAnd she was the most magical creature I ever knew,\u201d he says, \u201clike something from the movies.\u201d</p> <p>Gerald\u2019s mother was, he later recognised, a manic depressive \u2013 \u201cwith big, crinkly, burnt-blond hair [that] made her look like a high-yellow Whitney Houston\u201d. She left home and disappeared when he was 13. Some time before, Gerald\u2019s football star father, the son of a renowned Texas preacher, became hooked on heroin only to then carousel in and out of prison. And so this gifted, athletic teenager ended up in the care of his grandmother and older sister \u2013 until a football scholarship to Yale became his ticket \u201cto live America from the very bottom to the very top\u201d.</p> <p>Gerald and I talk via a video call from Los Angeles. Now 31, he is eloquent, handsome, thoughtful \u2013 the rags-to-riches poster boy for the American dream that his book, <em>There Will Be No Miracles Here</em>, sets out to dismantle. On the surface, his life reads as the elevator pitch for a Disney movie, the Horatio Alger myth beloved of pop culture and politicians; so much so that after meeting Gerald in 2016, former president George W Bush used his story in a speech to illustrate the plucky, inspirational, pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps narrative that feeds the country\u2019s identity.</p> <p>\u201cI think of my book as an intervention,\u201d says Gerald. \u201cTo turn this American dream on its head is like being the warning on a pack of cigarettes: people will still smoke, but the way we\u2019re taught to live our life in this society can kill you and it is killing people \u2013 even if they\u2019re not dead, they are miserable, sad, depressed. We need to have a referendum on the American <em>machine</em>.\u201d</p> <p>What would the question be?</p> <p>\u201cHow do we build a society where every kid has a shot? It\u2019s as simple as that. One exceptional case [like mine] does not justify the suffering of 13 million American children who don\u2019t have enough food or one in 30 who don\u2019t have a stable place to sleep. My generation has inherited a country that doesn\u2019t work any more.\u201d</p> <p>Gerald says he feels traumatised not only by his childhood, but by his belief that a Yale degree in political science, a prestigious MBA from Harvard Business School and a glittering career on Wall Street would save him. \u201cFor sure, it\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m in therapy.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/casey_gerald_the_gospel_of_doubt\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"260\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://embed.ted.com/talks/casey_gerald_the_gospel_of_doubt\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/casey_gerald_the_gospel_of_doubt?language=en\">Watch Casey Gerald\u2019s TED talk, The Gospel of Doubt</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>As a student, he took an internship at Lehman Brothers in the summer the bank filed for bankruptcy.

It\u2019s an ambitious exercise.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a great tradition of people writing on the margins of society and I am grateful for them, but I had no interest in writing that kind of book,\u201d he says. \u201cI set out to tell the truth and understand why I and a lot of my friends were cracked up. I started this in 2016 and so the country and a lot of the world was cracked up too, but I was sad.

My sisters, my friends, my cousins, that is not a way of living for anyone.\u201d</p> <p>Gerald\u2019s book mirrors the findings of a <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/10/31/most-think-the-american-dream-is-within-reach-for-them/\" title=\"\">2017 Pew study on the American dream</a> that confirms \u201cthe myth of bootstrapping\u201d \u2013 the fantastical notion that wealth and security can be achieved simply if you work and dream hard enough. The report reveals that social mobility between those at the bottom and those in the middle of American society has become increasingly harder, not easier. Given the choice, most families are happier to make ends meet and pay their bills than move up the economic ladder; this reads particularly true of African Americans who are stuck at the lowest levels and more likely to stay there and even potentially fall further behind from one generation to the next.</p> <p>\u201cYes, this is Donald Trump\u2019s America,\u201d shrugs Gerald. \u201cBut let me be clear: I\u2019m a black person, a queer person, my grandma\u2019s grandfather was born a slave in Texas. Very few black people \u2013 if any I know \u2013 were shocked that Donald Trump was elected. Donald Trump may be the most American president we\u2019ve ever had!</p> <p>\u201cFor 200 something years we\u2019ve been taught that the president was supposed to be better than everyone else \u2013 a Washington or Lincoln. Now is one of the few times we have a president that reflects a strong strain of depravity that has always been part of America. Life for people that Trump has been destroying with his policies \u2013 for poor people, people of colour, for immigrants \u2013 that has been intolerable and unsustainable for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>But Gerald isn\u2019t without hope. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a black American and not understand the extraordinary potential of the human spirit.\u201d In any case, he believes a shift is under way. \u201cFundamentally, the way we are taught to be men in this country is a dead end and it\u2019s changing \u2013 and I\u2019m happy about that,\u201d says Gerald. </p> <p>His book, like the TED talk he delivered in 2016 titled <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsrxbqFo41k\" title=\"\">The Gospel of Doubt</a>, begins with the end of the world: a flashback of Millennium Eve when he was in church with his grandmother praying for the Rapture. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason for beginning with that,\u201d he says. \u201cSo much of my childhood was the world ending over and over again; no one called a family meeting and said: \u2018Hey Case, how do you feel about your momma disappearing?\u2019 It just happened and then you have to figure life out.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/06/black-woman-donald-trump-democrats-kamala-harris\">Will it be a black woman who turfs Trump out of the White House? | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Figuring things out included his place in the elite institutions he later found himself in, how he might make a difference, and his sexuality.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to write a dissertation on being an oppressed gay person,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to bring worthy language to the beauty of loving another boy in a society that hates gay people \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean I have to hate myself.\u201d</p> <p>The neighbourhood of Oak Cliff, where Gerald grew up, has barely changed in recent years, he says.

Not in a conceited or entitled way \u2013 being poor, black, gay, \u201ca damn near orphan\u201d, and from the wrong side of Dallas meant he would often be told otherwise \u2013 but special because his mother insisted he was. \u201cAnd she was the most magical creature I ever knew,\u201d he says, \u201clike something from the movies.\u201d Gerald\u2019s mother was, he later recognised, a manic depressive \u2013 \u201cwith big, crinkly, burnt-blond hair [that] made her look like a high-yellow Whitney Houston\u201d. She left home and disappeared when he was 13. Some time before, Gerald\u2019s football star father, the son of a renowned Texas preacher, became hooked on heroin only to then carousel in and out of prison.

      "body": "<p>How does classical music attract new audiences? It\u2019s a question that has preoccupied promoters and performers for decades, and slowly, slowly, things are starting to change. <a href=\"https://www.multi-story.org.uk/\" title=\"\">The Multi-Story Orchestra</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lcorchestra.co.uk/\" title=\"\">London Contemporary Orchestra</a> are pioneering exciting music in unexpected venues, while bands with longer histories, such as the <a href=\"https://cbso.co.uk/education/special-schools/relaxed-concerts\" title=\"\">City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.sco.org.uk/creative-learning/current-projects/73-big-ears-little-ears\" title=\"\">Scottish Chamber Orchestra</a>, emulate the BBC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/proms/bbc-proms-2018/prom-59-relaxed-prom/\" title=\"\">Relaxed Proms</a> with informal concerts for all. Last week, Pizza Express, the restaurant chain known for its live jazz, sensed the zeitgeist and for the first time <a href=\"https://www.pizzaexpresslive.com/whats-on/a-winters-journey\" title=\"\">put art song on the menu</a>, while down the road, urbane Simon Rattle once again invited us in for drinks and a chat with the London Symphony Orchestra.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.askonasholt.co.uk/artists/matthew-rose/\" title=\"\">Matthew Rose</a>, the majestic bass known for his comic turns in opera, perched on a stool in the King\u2019s Road branch of Pizza Express like a cabaret crooner broken and bereft at the loss of his love. But for the Frank Sinatra songbook read Franz Schubert: this was the devastating song cycle <strong>Winterreise</strong>.

      "bodyText": "How does classical music attract new audiences? It\u2019s a question that has preoccupied promoters and performers for decades, and slowly, slowly, things are starting to change. The Multi-Story Orchestra and London Contemporary Orchestra are pioneering exciting music in unexpected venues, while bands with longer histories, such as the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, emulate the BBC\u2019s Relaxed Proms with informal concerts for all. Last week, Pizza Express, the restaurant chain known for its live jazz, sensed the zeitgeist and for the first time put art song on the menu, while down the road, urbane Simon Rattle once again invited us in for drinks and a chat with the London Symphony Orchestra. Matthew Rose, the majestic bass known for his comic turns in opera, perched on a stool in the King\u2019s Road branch of Pizza Express like a cabaret crooner broken and bereft at the loss of his love. But for the Frank Sinatra songbook read Franz Schubert: this was the devastating song cycle Winterreise. Gripping the edge of the piano like a despairing drinker clutching the bar, Rose poured out his heart in a performance that will be hard to equal this year \u2013 and it\u2019s only January. A packed audience, seated at tables around the tiny stage, was transfixed. The tinkle of cutlery and glass gave way to stunned silence. Food was left untouched, such was the visceral power of Rose\u2019s storytelling. For those who have heard his mellifluous voice fill an opera house it was a privilege to be in such an intimate setting, to be close to that supreme sense of line, that untapped power just waiting to be unleashed. Beautifully judged accompaniment came from pianist William Vann, the curator of this monthly art song series. Rachmaninov next. Some vodka with your pizza, perhaps?

Rattle said it was written for the \u201castonishing\u201d Canadian soprano Barbara Hannigan, and astonishing she duly was, her crystalline voice scaling unimaginable heights in a beguiling work that will haunt the memory. But as much as the orchestra shimmered and glowed and rarely rose above mezzo forte, Hannigan\u2019s words were lost in the hall.

In 2010, total bike sales in the UK amounted to \u00a31.49bn but these had declined to \u00a31.28bn by 2016, the most recent figures available and the lowest annual total for seven years.

Its members are discussing pay cuts and becoming more flexible about when they get paid. Many bike shops are now focusing on servicing bikes and building them from parts bought online \u2013 Brixton Cycles charges \u00a3130 to construct a full bike \u2013 rather than relying on sales. \u201cWe\u2019ve just reduced our shopfloor size to increase the workshop \u2013 it\u2019s nearly twice the size now,\u201d Sullivan said. </p> <p>The decline of high street bike shops, at a time when people are being encouraged to be healthier and to reduce their car use, reflects a wider problem: despite millions of pounds being spent in recent years promoting cycling, the number of people using bikes has remained largely static.</p> <p>In 2017, 14% of respondents to a national survey said they cycled at least once a week. One fifth also said they cycled, but less often than that. Two out of three, though, reported that they cycled less than once a year, or never. Those figures have hardly changed since 2003, according to Cycling UK, largely because the younger generation think cycling \u201cis too scary\u201d.</p> <p>Jones drew parallels between the decline of the bike shop and another institution that is falling out of favour with millennials: \u201cBike shops are like pubs when it comes to maintaining community spirit. In many ways they\u2019re that important.\u201d</p>",

Like many other bike shops, Brixton Cycles is tweaking its business model in a bid to stay alive. Its members are discussing pay cuts and becoming more flexible about when they get paid. Many bike shops are now focusing on servicing bikes and building them from parts bought online \u2013 Brixton Cycles charges \u00a3130 to construct a full bike \u2013 rather than relying on sales. \u201cWe\u2019ve just reduced our shopfloor size to increase the workshop \u2013 it\u2019s nearly twice the size now,\u201d Sullivan said. The decline of high street bike shops, at a time when people are being encouraged to be healthier and to reduce their car use, reflects a wider problem: despite millions of pounds being spent in recent years promoting cycling, the number of people using bikes has remained largely static. In 2017, 14% of respondents to a national survey said they cycled at least once a week. One fifth also said they cycled, but less often than that. Two out of three, though, reported that they cycled less than once a year, or never. Those figures have hardly changed since 2003, according to Cycling UK, largely because the younger generation think cycling \u201cis too scary\u201d. Jones drew parallels between the decline of the bike shop and another institution that is falling out of favour with millennials: \u201cBike shops are like pubs when it comes to maintaining community spirit. In many ways they\u2019re that important.\u201d",

In 90 minutes we maybe didn\u2019t deserve it. We had chances, but we did not control the game like we want. Our reaction after the goal was not efficient, we did not impose our gameplan. We lost a big opportunity to get closer to Chelsea in the table. At home we are feeling good but away we are not getting results like we want. We must do more. We need to continue working and gain confidence. The club is working on transfers but I am happy with the players.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c39fc70e4b0cebe76184f0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-12T14:45:53.434Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Now a rather more calm and considered take from their manager Manuel Pellegrini.</strong> \u201cI was pleased with the consistency of the team. We didn\u2019t allow Arsenal to create chances, they have so many good players in attack. We played with the mentality of a big team, we tried to score a second goal. I am happy for them. We have to try to work and play in the same way all the time, against big teams and small teams. Declan Rice is improving, he plays a lot of balls in front and not back. In the future he will be a top, top player. Samir Nasri was very good, his pass for Declan was very good. He could continue but I didn\u2019t want to take the risk. If he wants to be the player he was a few years ago, he can do it. We will see what happens with Marko Arnautovic in the next couple of days, and will take the best decision for everyone.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c39fa16e4b02fb91ff132c0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-12T14:40:13.147Z\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>West Ham captain Mark Noble is told that West Ham have just beaten Arsenal at home for the first time in 13 years. </strong>\u201cIs it really? I didn\u2019t know it was that long. It was hard work, I thought we played brilliantly in the first half, and we started on the front foot in the second half. I\u2019m buzzing for this young man here, to score his first goal. We\u2019ve been on at him in training! He should have scored in the first half from a header, but his finish was fantastic. You could see the joy on his face, how much it meant to him. It\u2019s been a really special six months for Declan. I\u2019d be surprised if he sleeps tonight, really surprised!\u201d</p> <p><strong>Young Declan is standing next to his captain with a grin as wide as the Thames.</strong> \u201cI can\u2019t put it into words. The lads are always on to me to shoot. I thought about picking a pass, but I was in the box and thought why not? Take it on! It\u2019s gone in the top corner, and we\u2019ve beat Arsenal, it\u2019s a special moment! To be fair recently, I\u2019ve been getting myself into the box more recently, and I missed that header before half time. I was gutted with that, but managed to get the only goal of the game. I don\u2019t think I want to be 20 now!\u201d</p> <p>That was a glorious interview. Rice could hardly get the words out, he was smiling so broadly. It was wonderfully infectious; I defy anyone, even Arsenal fans wallowing in the misery of defeat, not to grin like a loon themselves while watching that. Such a sweet moment, and one that Rice will remember forever. Factoring in his birthday on Monday, I suspect he\u2019ll stop smiling around Wednesday or Thursday afternoon.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c39f849e4b072dc52e6d727\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-12T14:26:18.254Z\">2.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rice won\u2019t be 20 years of age until next week.</strong> He really does look the part already, though. And here he celebrates with a wide smile playing across his face, after a match-winning performance against Arsenal. There aren\u2019t too many West Ham players who have enjoyed one of those in the last decade. The win moves West Ham up into eighth spot, on 31 points, while Arsenal remain stuck in fifth on 41, now within reach of revived hunters Manchester United. The rest of this weekend\u2019s Premier League card promises to be very fascinating indeed.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c39f817e4b072dc52e6d725\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-12T14:22:50.378Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FULL TIME: West Ham United 1-0 Arsenal</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This Declan Rice, eh?</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c39f7ede4b0cebe76184ef3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-12T14:22:13.630Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 min +3: </strong>West Ham hearts are in mouths as Kolasinac bursts down the left and crosses for Koscielny, who plants a diving header into the bottom right!

Heady days. But since then, their record over their illustrious London rivals hasn\u2019t been too great. They\u2019ve subsequently played each other 23 times, Arsenal winning on 18 occasions, West Ham just the once. Those Hammers fans slightly longer of tooth won\u2019t be looking forward to this.</p> <p><strong>And yet West Ham shouldn\u2019t give up hope just yet.</strong> They may have lost their last three matches against Arsenal, but those games were all held at the Emirates, and the last time they met at the London Stadium the game ended in a goalless draw. Perhaps more pertinently, they\u2019ve taken 16 points out of the last 24 on offer. They\u2019re beginning to hit their stride under Manuel Pellegrini.</p> <p><strong>Arsenal by comparison are currently a little difficult to predict. </strong>Unai Emery\u2019s lads can be sensational on their day, and they\u2019re putting together quite a portfolio of pretty goals. But they haven\u2019t won away in the league since November, a run that\u2019s taken in painful defeats at Southampton and Liverpool. To illustrate their inconsistency, their last three matches have ended 3-0, 4-1 and 1-5. Good luck guessing what they\u2019ll do today.</p> <p><strong>So for different reasons, both teams will fancy their chances. </strong>Hopefully that\u2019ll mean a lovely open match full of goals, in a fixture that has recently finished 3-3, 1-5 and, er, 0-0.

      "bodyText": "Right, we\u2019re all done here, then! All that remains is for me to point you in the direction of our man Jacob Steinberg\u2019s match report, and to remind you that there\u2019s some hot 3pm action going on in Rob Smyth\u2019s Clockwatch. Enjoy, enjoy! And now here\u2019s Unai Emery\u2019s take. \u201cIt is a bad result for us. In 90 minutes we maybe didn\u2019t deserve it. We had chances, but we did not control the game like we want. Our reaction after the goal was not efficient, we did not impose our gameplan. We lost a big opportunity to get closer to Chelsea in the table. At home we are feeling good but away we are not getting results like we want. We must do more. We need to continue working and gain confidence. The club is working on transfers but I am happy with the players.\u201d Now a rather more calm and considered take from their manager Manuel Pellegrini. \u201cI was pleased with the consistency of the team. We didn\u2019t allow Arsenal to create chances, they have so many good players in attack. We played with the mentality of a big team, we tried to score a second goal. I am happy for them. We have to try to work and play in the same way all the time, against big teams and small teams. Declan Rice is improving, he plays a lot of balls in front and not back. In the future he will be a top, top player. Samir Nasri was very good, his pass for Declan was very good. He could continue but I didn\u2019t want to take the risk. If he wants to be the player he was a few years ago, he can do it. We will see what happens with Marko Arnautovic in the next couple of days, and will take the best decision for everyone.\u201d West Ham captain Mark Noble is told that West Ham have just beaten Arsenal at home for the first time in 13 years. \u201cIs it really? I didn\u2019t know it was that long. It was hard work, I thought we played brilliantly in the first half, and we started on the front foot in the second half. I\u2019m buzzing for this young man here, to score his first goal. We\u2019ve been on at him in training! He should have scored in the first half from a header, but his finish was fantastic. You could see the joy on his face, how much it meant to him. It\u2019s been a really special six months for Declan. I\u2019d be surprised if he sleeps tonight, really surprised!\u201d Young Declan is standing next to his captain with a grin as wide as the Thames. \u201cI can\u2019t put it into words. The lads are always on to me to shoot. I thought about picking a pass, but I was in the box and thought why not? Take it on! It\u2019s gone in the top corner, and we\u2019ve beat Arsenal, it\u2019s a special moment! To be fair recently, I\u2019ve been getting myself into the box more recently, and I missed that header before half time. I was gutted with that, but managed to get the only goal of the game. I don\u2019t think I want to be 20 now!\u201d That was a glorious interview. Rice could hardly get the words out, he was smiling so broadly. It was wonderfully infectious; I defy anyone, even Arsenal fans wallowing in the misery of defeat, not to grin like a loon themselves while watching that. Such a sweet moment, and one that Rice will remember forever. Factoring in his birthday on Monday, I suspect he\u2019ll stop smiling around Wednesday or Thursday afternoon. Rice won\u2019t be 20 years of age until next week. He really does look the part already, though. And here he celebrates with a wide smile playing across his face, after a match-winning performance against Arsenal. There aren\u2019t too many West Ham players who have enjoyed one of those in the last decade. The win moves West Ham up into eighth spot, on 31 points, while Arsenal remain stuck in fifth on 41, now within reach of revived hunters Manchester United. The rest of this weekend\u2019s Premier League card promises to be very fascinating indeed. This Declan Rice, eh? 90 min +3: West Ham hearts are in mouths as Kolasinac bursts down the left and crosses for Koscielny, who plants a diving header into the bottom right! But Kolasinac was well offside, and the flag goes up. 90 min +2: Arsenal have scored in each of their last 20 Premier League matches. Is this fine run over? 90 min +1: The first of three added minutes. Iwobi reaches the byline on the left and pulls one back. Rice - the man of the match - slices wildly behind for a corner. Torreira loops the set piece straight down Fabianski\u2019s throat. 90 min: Anderson romps down the left. He\u2019s got Snodgrass completely unmarked in the middle, but doesn\u2019t spot him and passes to the nearby Noble instead. There goes a fine chance to wrap this up. 88 min: Noble slips a pass down the right for Snodgrass, who looks for Carroll in the centre. Carroll can\u2019t get on the end of the cross, caught in two minds between a header and a spectacular overhead kick. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if Arsenal seem stumped and could really use the sort of tricky player able to create a bit of magic,\u201d observes Matthew Schofield. \u201cShame they don\u2019t have one on the bench.\u201d 87 min: It\u2019s beginning to look that way, as Carroll embarks on a dribble, Anderson bursts down the left, and Rice conducts a little triangular keepball. This is impressive game management. 85 min: West Ham knock it around the back awhile. They\u2019re in control of this match; can they see out their 50th Premier League game at the London Stadium? 83 min: Arsenal walk the ball in the goal, 2002 style, Ramsey chipping the ball down the left to release Kolasinac, who rolls a cross for Aubameyang to tap in. But Kolasinac was a mile offside, play having stopped long before the net rippled. 82 min: West Ham make a final, defensively minded change, replacing Antonio with Obiang. 81 min: Arsenal\u2019s passes aren\u2019t sticking. On the touchline, Emery cuts a frustrated figure. 79 min: Arsenal keep hold of the ball, but fail to do a great deal with it. West Ham look fairly comfortable at the moment. 77 min: Ramsey, out on the right, hooks a cross into the West Ham box that\u2019s easy for Fabianski to collect. He shakes his head in frustration, as Arsenal continue to toil. 75 min: Snodgrass makes ground down the left, and his cross to the far post very nearly finds Antonio. Koscielny does well to eyebrow the ball away from danger. Both West Ham subs already in the thick of the action. 74 min: Carroll is already giving Sokratis something to think about. His mere presence panics the Arsenal defender into dragging him down by the shirt on the halfway line. 72 min: Ramsey\u2019s corner arcs straight out of play. Not worth waiting for. 71 min: Before it can be taken, Nasri is replaced by Snodgrass, while Arnautovic makes way for Carroll. As he departs, he spins through 360 degrees and ostentatiously applauds. A goodbye to the fans? 70 min: Kolasinac slips one down the left wing for Ramsey, who wins a corner. 69 min: Bellerin comes on for Maitland-Niles. 68 min: Guendouzi has another long-distance effort. This one is well gathered by Fabianski. 67 min: Arsenal are beginning to create chances. Ramsey flicks a pass to Iwobi down the left. Iwobi arrives in the area and zips a fine shot across Fabianski and inches wide of the right-hand post. Not sure the keeper had that covered. 65 min: And now Aubameyang spurns another chance, as Kolasinac crosses low from the left and releases the striker into the box. He\u2019s one on one with Fabianski, but faced with a slight angle on the left, hesitates, allows Cresswell to slide across him, and blasts wildly over the bar. 63 min: Maitland-Niles robs Anderson near the right-hand corner flag, and tees up Ramsey to the side of the West Ham box. Ramsey drops a shoulder, makes for the byline, and dinks one to the far stick, where Aubameyang heads over from close range. Chance. 62 min: The resulting free kick isn\u2019t up to much. A moment for Arsenal to regroup. 60 min: Antonio threatens to burst down the right wing. Kolasinac comes across in the agricultural style and hacks him down. A no-brainer of a booking, and Arsenal\u2019s left back would do well to simmer down. 59 min: A double change by Arsenal, who hook Xhaka and Mustafi and replace them with Torreira and Ramsey. 58 min: Felipe Anderson\u2019s free kick-cum-corner finds the head of Ogbonna, who flashes wide left of the goal. 57 min: Felipe Anderson wins yet another corner for West Ham with an entertaining dribble. Nothing much comes of it, but then Noble holds up the ball near the flag. Aubameyang clatters into the back of him, conceding a free kick right by the corner. Before it can be taken, Kolasinac gets up in the linesman\u2019s grille, and is lucky to escape censure. 56 min: West Ham\u2019s sixth corner of the game, out on the right. Felipe Anderson takes. Antonio attempts a mid-air pirouette and flick at the near post. Leno gathers easily. 54 min: Guendouzi latches onto a very poor Antonio pass and looks for the bottom-left corner from 25 yards. It\u2019s not far wide, but Fabianski always had that covered. \u201cArise Sir Declan Moore!\u201d chirps Brian Withington. \u201cIs it too soon/heretical to detect more than a passing resemblance between Declan Rice and a young Robert Moore? Their tackling and interceptions similarly effortless too. Please God/Gareth let him pick England.\u201d 52 min: Only Fulham (28) and Bournemouth (23) have conceded more goals away from home this season than Arsenal\u2019s 22. Imagine what bother they\u2019d be in if they started letting them in from corners as well. 50 min: The joy on Rice\u2019s face was something to behold there. That really meant something. And what a fine finish, calmly dispatched into the top corner. Arsenal respond well. First Lacazette drives down the left, and there\u2019s a bit of pinball before Fabianski gathers. Then Aubameyang wins Arsenal\u2019s first corner of the afternoon down the right; Xhaka\u2019s set piece bounces straight through the box and out for a goal kick. Anderson comes straight back at Arsenal with a scamper down the right. He reaches the byline and tugs the ball back. Xhaka\u2019s attempted clearance is no good. Nasri intercepts and tees up Rice, who pearls his first goal for West Ham United into the top right! He wheels away in sheer delight! What a moment for the young man! 47 min: Cresswell\u2019s delivery is headed over his own bar by Kolasinac. Yet another West Ham corner, out on the right. Anderson doesn\u2019t beat the first man. Arsenal half clear. But ... 46 min: Some loose control from Guendouzi gifts Anderson a run down the left. Mustafi slides across and nearly gets the ball, but nicks the man instead. That\u2019s the game\u2019s first booking, and a free kick in a very dangerous position near the Arsenal area. Arsenal get the second half underway. No half-time substitutions. \u201cHonoured to make it into the MBM,\u201d writes Zubin Mistry, the good doctor of 41 min fame. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t mean to invoke the \u2018Dr\u2019. Damn you, email signature. Unless, of course, that\u2019s why I made the cut and I can finally persuade my family that doing a PhD in medieval history really was worth it (beyond somehow jamming an academic job that means I\u2019m at work on Saturday following the MBM instead of watching the game live).\u201d Half-time reading. Arsenal\u2019s men won\u2019t be winning the title this season. But their women might. It hasn\u2019t been a classic, but both sides have had their chances. However it remains goalless in this London derby. Look on the bright side: it\u2019s perfectly poised for a great second half. Stay tuned! 45 min: Another corner for West Ham down the right. Rice flashes a header wide left from six yards. Arsenal\u2019s proud record, and Gary Naylor\u2019s first draft, should be in tatters. But both remain intact. 43 min: Arsenal hog possession, but don\u2019t really go anywhere. Maitland-Niles briefly threatens to burst down the right, but that\u2019s it. The atmosphere is a bit flat now, this game having never quite sparked into life. 41 min: Zabaleta romps forward and slips a ball wide right for Antonio, who has three men in the middle to find. But instead of crossing, he opts for a spectacular curler towards the top left. Nope! \u201cI\u2019d quibble with your fate-tempting reference to Arsenal\u2019s record on corners this season,\u201d writes Dr Zubin Mistry. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely looked defensively vulnerable from our own corners this season, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve conceded a few on quick breaks from them. Worth a mention in the chapter on playing against Arsenal in that tactics textbook Gary Naylor is re-writing.\u201d 39 min: Nasri really didn\u2019t do an awful lot there. It looks as though Gendouzi hurt his shoulder as he fell awkwardly. A sore one, but he looks good to continue. 37 min: Guendouzi is brought down by Nasri as he plays the ball out of defence. There wasn\u2019t much in that, but the Arsenal man\u2019s not getting up quickly. 35 min: Guendouzi drops a shoulder to make himself some space down the inside right. He creams a shot towards the top right; it flies inches wide of the post. Fabianski wasn\u2019t getting to that. The Arsenal section thinks it\u2019s in; the home support take great pleasure in explaining the error of their ways. 34 min: The game\u2019s got a little scrappy of late. Moves of more than two passes are at a premium. It\u2019s all a bit pinball. 32 min: Noble\u2019s long ball down the middle finds Arnautovic free! But he can\u2019t dig the ball out from under his feet, so slips a pass to Noble, who in turn tees up Felipe Anderson, 25 yards out and charging down the inside right. Anderson creams a low shot across Leno and inches wide of the left-hand post. Arnautovic looked well offside initially, but had in fact checked at the last second and timed his run to perfection. 30 min: Iwobi slips a pass to Maitland-Niles, who briefly threatens to skin Cresswell and romp into the West Ham box. But Cresswell passes the test. 28 min: A third corner of the match for West Ham, this time out on the right. Filipe Anderson one-twos with Nasri, and his cross is then deflected into the arms of Leno. Arsenal\u2019s proud record at corners etc. \u201cWith so few goals resulting from corners for the attacking side these days, do more goals come for the defending side, breaking against defenders and midfielders upfield and out of position? If so, why not concede more corners to allow more such opportunities?\u201d Gary Naylor there, rewriting the tactical textbooks. Step aside, Wilson, a new man\u2019s in town. 26 min: Twice in the matter of a minute, Arnautovic drops a shoulder down the inside-left channel to make some space. The first time he can\u2019t get a shot away; the second he feeds Nasri on the overlap. Faced with a tight angle, Nasri ripples the side netting. But that was a very decent move by West Ham, who look reasonably lively in attack themselves this afternoon. 24 min: Nasri fights with great determination down the left and wins a corner out of a not particularly promising position. But the set piece is wasted and Arsenal\u2019s grand record at corners this season is maintained. 22 min: Iwobi flicks a gorgeous pass round the corner to send Kolasinac away down the left. Kolasinac enters the box and pulls back for Lacazette, who is cocking his leg back to shoot when Rice comes in to scupper his plan. Great play all round. 21 min: Iwobi, who is beginning to look a real player this season, drifts in from the left and slips a cute pass into the area for Aubameyang. But the flag goes up for offside. Arsenal look like they could do damage every time they go forward. 19 min: Aubameyang and Iwobi combine to release Lacazette into the West Ham box from the right. But Lacazette has been tugging shirts in order to get a jump on the West Ham defence, and the referee blows up accordingly. 18 min: Arnautovic is sent into acres down the right by Zabaleta, but his cross, needlessly delivered first time, is a panicked nonsense. There\u2019s nobody in the middle, and it\u2019s an easy gather for Leno. Patience, dear boy. 16 min: West Ham respond well, Arnautovic probing down the right, but unable to find Nasri in the middle. Then Cresswell tears down the left and sends a dangerous low cross into the box. Leno gets down to smother. After a slow start, this is developing into an interesting match. 15 min: Arsenal suddenly look very dangerous. Lacazette and Guendouzi swarm the West Ham back line; the latter should release Aubameyang into the box on the right, but his pass down the channel is too strong. 13 min: Aubameyang turns in the centre circle and bursts upfield. He slips a pass inside to Iwobi, who in turn finds Lacazette bombing down the inside-right channel. He enters the box and lashes hard towards the bottom right. Fabianksi parries brilliantly, and Lacazette blazes the rebound over the bar; it was a difficult chance. 11 min: ... nothing much happens. Arsenal still haven\u2019t conceded a goal from a corner this season. Felipe Anderson retrieves the ball from the right wing, sashays infield, and looks to curl one into the top left. Always high and wide. 10 min: Nasri feeds Cresswell down the left, and West Ham earn the first corner of the game. From which ... 9 min: Lacazette finds space easily down the middle of the park, sent scampering into it by Xhaka. West Ham offer him far too much time, and he\u2019s able to have a dig from 25 yards. He looks for the top right, but the effort is always curling wide. 8 min: Nasri bursts down the inside-right channel, Arsenal not offering much resistance. But there\u2019s nobody in the middle for him to cross to. The move peters out. Nasri is getting pelters from the away support that once doted on him, much as you\u2019d expect. 6 min: The match comes to life. Iwobi bursts down the inside-right channel but can\u2019t find the killer pass to send Guendouzi clear into the box. Then Antonio tightropes his way down the right touchline, a brilliant run that sets up Nasri and Noble for a one-two across the face of the Arsenal box. Noble eventually sends a pearoller into the arms of Leno. 4 min: Arsenal push West Ham back. Ogbonna is forced to play a nervous pass out of defence from deep, and Xhaka nearly takes up possession 25 yards out. Rice does very well to get his body in the way and draw a foul that takes the pressure off. 2 min: Guendouzi nearly takes advantage of a heavy Rice touch, but the West Ham midfielder recovers well to win the ball back before Arsenal can launch a dangerous attack. Just as well, because West Ham were light at the back there. And we\u2019re off! The hosts get the ball rolling, and stroke it around the back awhile. Everyone gets a touch. The home crowd belt out a fine rendition of the club anthem. The teams are out! West Ham are in their world-famous claret and blue, while Arsenal sport third-choice green. It\u2019s a drizzly, overcast day in the East End, but the atmosphere in the London Stadium is derby-day fine. Both sets of fans giving it plenty. Pretty bubbles in the air. We\u2019ll be off before you know it! Kilroy William Hargreaves was here. \u201cWot no Ozil? Particularly after he has advertised his full training all week and availability on Twitter etc. And this with three at the back, admittedly still with defensive frailties. I suspect that, with the club not feeling able to offer Ramsey a hefty new contract, and Emery\u2019s weekday words on loans only, no purchases, that Mesut\u2019s eye-watering take-home is stifling Unai\u2019s ability to mould the team in his own likeness. And he\u2019s showing this with his being incalcitrant over Mesut. Tough at the top.\u201d Yes, it\u2019s increasingly looking like a love affair not likely to last. That\u2019s the Rumour Mill kept busy for the next few weeks/months. Unai Emery talks! \u201cFor us it is very important for the table, and it is a derby. We will play with great motivation in the hope of making the top four. There is a chance for us today to play a good match and show everyone we are well. We can be better.\u201d Manuel Pellegrini speaks! \u201cMarko Arnautovic is important. He has trained with the squad and the team; we are not thinking about other things. I know Samir Nasri very well, he played in the cup last week which was important for him after being out for a long time. He may not be ready for 90 minutes every week. I hope today we will be balanced and aggressive, we will go for the three points.\u201d Arsenal may have the upper hand in the Premier League ... but West Ham will always have the 1980 FA Cup. Any old excuse to pop up a picture of a cup final from Wembley\u2019s sun-kissed golden age. West Ham make three changes to the team named for the 2-2 draw with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, their last Premier League game. Mark Noble and Michail Antonio return, while Samir Nasri makes his debut for his new club in the League. Dropping down to the bench: Robert Snodgrass, Pedro Obiang and Andy Carroll. Arsenal meanwhile name the same side picked for the 4-1 win over Fulham. Plenty of changes from the team selected at Blackpool, of course, but that was the FA Cup and in the Premier League you know exactly what you\u2019re getting with Arsenal these days. West Ham United: Fabianski, Zabaleta, Diop, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Noble, Rice, Antonio, Nasri, Felipe Anderson, Arnautovic. Subs: Carroll, Snodgrass, Adrian, Obiang, Masuaku, Lucas Perez, Diangana. Arsenal: Leno, Koscielny, Papastathopoulos, Mustafi, Maitland-Niles, Guendouzi, Xhaka, Kolasinac, Iwobi, Aubameyang, Lacazette. Subs: Cech, Bellerin, Ramsey, Torreira, Lichtsteiner, Monreal, Nketiah. Referee: Jonathan Moss (County Durham). West Ham United did the double over Arsenal in the 2006-07 season. Marlon Harewood settled a 1-0 win for the Hammers at Upton Park; Bobby Zamora secured the same scoreline at the Emirates. Heady days. But since then, their record over their illustrious London rivals hasn\u2019t been too great. They\u2019ve subsequently played each other 23 times, Arsenal winning on 18 occasions, West Ham just the once. Those Hammers fans slightly longer of tooth won\u2019t be looking forward to this. And yet West Ham shouldn\u2019t give up hope just yet. They may have lost their last three matches against Arsenal, but those games were all held at the Emirates, and the last time they met at the London Stadium the game ended in a goalless draw. Perhaps more pertinently, they\u2019ve taken 16 points out of the last 24 on offer. They\u2019re beginning to hit their stride under Manuel Pellegrini. Arsenal by comparison are currently a little difficult to predict. Unai Emery\u2019s lads can be sensational on their day, and they\u2019re putting together quite a portfolio of pretty goals. But they haven\u2019t won away in the league since November, a run that\u2019s taken in painful defeats at Southampton and Liverpool. To illustrate their inconsistency, their last three matches have ended 3-0, 4-1 and 1-5. Good luck guessing what they\u2019ll do today. So for different reasons, both teams will fancy their chances. Hopefully that\u2019ll mean a lovely open match full of goals, in a fixture that has recently finished 3-3, 1-5 and, er, 0-0. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.30pm GMT.",

      "body": "<h2>\u2018Traditional masculinity\u2019 is harmful, says the APA</h2> <p>Last August the American Psychological Association (APA) released its first-ever guidelines for therapists <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/about/policy/boys-men-practice-guidelines.pdf\">working with men and boys</a>. Nobody paid much attention to these for several months, but they went viral this week. This was largely due to the APA condensing its academic report into a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/APA_Monitor/status/1080485620303233026\">tweet</a> explaining that the key takeaway is that traditional masculinity is harmful and socializing boys to suppress their emotions causes damage. Suddenly everyone on the internet was an armchair psychologist and conservatives were up in arms about war on men.</p> <p>Traditional notions of masculinity, marked by stoicism, competitiveness and aggression, are clearly toxic to both men and women. As the APA write in an article <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/01/ce-corner.aspx\">accompanying the study</a>: \u201cMen commit 90% of homicides in the United States and represent 77% of homicide victims. They\u2019re the demographic group most at risk of being victimized by violent crime. They are 3.5 times more likely than women to die by suicide.\u201d They also point to research that found men who bought into traditional notions of masculinity were less likely to seek mental health support than those who had more open gender attitudes. The guidelines advise psychologists to understand \u201chow power, privilege and sexism work both by conferring benefits to men and by trapping them in narrow roles\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/29/year-in-patriarchy-brett-kavanaugh-serena-williams-metoo\">The year in patriarchy: from Kavanaugh's fury to Serena William's catsuit | Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While all that sounds eminently sensible to me, certain intellectuals on the right have predictably interpreted it as meaning the APA has it out for men. The Fox News host Laura Ingraham, for example, made the compelling argument that toxic masculinity is actually great because she <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/is-toxic-masculinity-a-threat-to-america\">\u201cloves James Bond\u201d</a>. (Please can someone explain to Ingraham that Bond is a fictional character?) Meanwhile Tucker Carlson, that bastion of reason, asked: \u201cWhat would happen if you told girls the qualities that make you feel female are poison and you must suppress them?\u201d I don\u2019t think he quite understands that feminists have been fighting against poisonous gender stereotypes for a very long time. And, by the way, the APA has a set of guidelines for women.</p> <p>Despite the right using the APA guidelines as an opportunity for outrage, we should all be highly encouraged by the new guidelines. It\u2019s a great sign that toxic gender norms are being gradually interrogated and dismantled and it will literally save lives.</p> <h2>Rahaf al-Qunun is safe \u2013 many Saudi women are not</h2> <p>Twitter can be a hellhole, but it can also be a powerful force for good. This week it may well have saved the life of 18-year-old Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, who fled her Saudi family and pleaded for help on Twitter from an airport hotel in Bangkok. When she first tweeted about being worried her family would kill her for renouncing Islam (which is punishable by death in Saudia Arabia), Rahaf only had a handful of followers. But, thanks to the Egyptian American feminist Mona Eltahawy translating her tweets from Arabic and sending them out to her large follower base, she quickly caught the world\u2019s attention. On Friday, Rahaf was granted asylum in Canada. It is wonderful that Rahaf is now safe, but let us remember that many women in Saudi Arabia\u2019s repressive regime are not.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Traditional masculinity\u2019 is harmful, says the APA Last August the American Psychological Association (APA) released its first-ever guidelines for therapists working with men and boys. Nobody paid much attention to these for several months, but they went viral this week. This was largely due to the APA condensing its academic report into a tweet explaining that the key takeaway is that traditional masculinity is harmful and socializing boys to suppress their emotions causes damage. Suddenly everyone on the internet was an armchair psychologist and conservatives were up in arms about war on men. Traditional notions of masculinity, marked by stoicism, competitiveness and aggression, are clearly toxic to both men and women. As the APA write in an article accompanying the study: \u201cMen commit 90% of homicides in the United States and represent 77% of homicide victims. They\u2019re the demographic group most at risk of being victimized by violent crime. They are 3.5 times more likely than women to die by suicide.\u201d They also point to research that found men who bought into traditional notions of masculinity were less likely to seek mental health support than those who had more open gender attitudes. The guidelines advise psychologists to understand \u201chow power, privilege and sexism work both by conferring benefits to men and by trapping them in narrow roles\u201d. While all that sounds eminently sensible to me, certain intellectuals on the right have predictably interpreted it as meaning the APA has it out for men. The Fox News host Laura Ingraham, for example, made the compelling argument that toxic masculinity is actually great because she \u201cloves James Bond\u201d. (Please can someone explain to Ingraham that Bond is a fictional character?) Meanwhile Tucker Carlson, that bastion of reason, asked: \u201cWhat would happen if you told girls the qualities that make you feel female are poison and you must suppress them?\u201d I don\u2019t think he quite understands that feminists have been fighting against poisonous gender stereotypes for a very long time. And, by the way, the APA has a set of guidelines for women. Despite the right using the APA guidelines as an opportunity for outrage, we should all be highly encouraged by the new guidelines. It\u2019s a great sign that toxic gender norms are being gradually interrogated and dismantled and it will literally save lives. Rahaf al-Qunun is safe \u2013 many Saudi women are not Twitter can be a hellhole, but it can also be a powerful force for good. This week it may well have saved the life of 18-year-old Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, who fled her Saudi family and pleaded for help on Twitter from an airport hotel in Bangkok. When she first tweeted about being worried her family would kill her for renouncing Islam (which is punishable by death in Saudia Arabia), Rahaf only had a handful of followers. But, thanks to the Egyptian American feminist Mona Eltahawy translating her tweets from Arabic and sending them out to her large follower base, she quickly caught the world\u2019s attention. On Friday, Rahaf was granted asylum in Canada. It is wonderful that Rahaf is now safe, but let us remember that many women in Saudi Arabia\u2019s repressive regime are not. The kingdom has locked up a number of women\u2019s rights activists, and there are worries they are being tortured. Let\u2019s not stop paying attention to the plight of women in Saudi Arabia when Rahaf has faded from the headlines.

      "bodyText": "The number of rapes, murders and other serious crimes committed by offenders on parole has risen by more than 50% since reforms to probation were introduced four years ago, according to official data that has triggered calls for the government to rethink its plans for another shake-up of the service. Serious further offence reviews \u2013 which take place when a convicted offender under supervision is charged with another serious offence (SFO) \u2013 rose from 409 in the year before the 2014 reforms to 627 in the 12 months up to last April. The new figures for England and Wales \u2013 which were shared with Plaid Cymru\u2019s justice spokeswoman, Liz Saville Roberts \u2013 come as it emerges that coroners have taken the highly unusual decision to reopen inquests into three people killed by offenders under supervision, a move that is expected to expose systemic flaws in the probation service. The problems are blamed on former justice secretary Chris Grayling\u2019s reform programme, which saw some probation work outsourced to eight private providers, who were given responsibility for running 21 community rehabilitation companies working with low and medium risk offenders. \u201cSince the private contracts were let there have been staff cuts of up to 30%, offices have been merged and the quality of supervision has fallen sharply,\u201d said Harry Fletcher of the Victims\u2019 Rights Campaign. Ian Lawrence, general secretary of the probation union, Napo, said there was a \u201cclear correlation\u201d between the increase and the reforms, which he blamed on increased workloads, low morale and chronic staff shortages which have left the National Probation Service with more than 1,000 vacancies. \u201cThere will be further serious offences whatever system you run but we think the fragmentation of the service has been a serious factor in the increase in SFOs,\u201d he said. A ministry of justice spokeswoman said the reforms \u201chad extended probation supervision to around 40,000 extra offenders each year\u201d and therefore \u201canalysis of the number of offences does not provide a like-for-like comparison\u201d. The Observer has learned that any lapses in the supervision of serious offenders are set to be examined in court following a decision to reopen inquests into the deaths of three people who were killed by offenders under supervision. As a result, previously confidential documents, including serious case reviews and risk assessments, will be shared with the victims\u2019 families. Alex Malcolm, five, died in 2016, after being attacked by Marvyn Iheanacho who was in a relationship with his mother. Iheanacho had been convicted of attacks on previous partners and children. A condition of his supervision was that he was not to be left alone with a child. Lisa Skidmore was raped and murdered in 2016 by Leroy Campbell, a registered sex offender who was under supervision on probation. A review revealed that six weeks before he killed Skidmore, Campbell had told his probation officer he was having feelings that were \u201ctroubling him\u201d and mentioned rape. Conner Marshall, 18, was beaten to death by David Braddon in south Wales in 2015. Braddon, who had taken a cocktail of drugs and alcohol, had missed eight separate probation appointments in the weeks leading up to the attack. The coroners have agreed to resume the inquests so that lessons can be learned to prevent future deaths and because, it is argued, the state may have failed in its duty to safeguard the right to life. Amid signs the system is struggling, the government is ending the contracts for the eight private providers two years early and reducing the number of community rehabilitation companies from 21 to 10. It is also spending \u00a322m improving support for ex-offenders. Saville Roberts accused the government of \u201cwilfully wrecking the humanitarian principle of rehabilitation\u201d and called for more probation services to be returned to government control. A coalition comprising the probation trade unions, the Probation Institute, the Howard League, the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, and the Centre for Justice Innovation have written to the justice secretary, David Gauke, urging him not to rush into retendering the contracts until a thorough review of the probation service has been conducted.",

      "body": "<p>Exactly two years ago, in early 2017, the actor Mahershala Ali and his wife were about to give birth \u2013 one after the other. \u201cIt\u2019s something we still joke about,\u201d says the 44-year-old American, sitting in a London hotel, smiling at the memory. \u201cMy wife was pregnant with a baby. And I was pregnant with an Oscar.\u201d</p> <p>The actor knows that sounds glib. He knows that however exciting or worked-for an industry prize \u2013 Ali won his best supporting actor award that year for a standout performance in the coming-of-age drama Moonlight \u2013 nothing compares to the graft of bearing an actual child. But aspects of the comparison stand. There\u2019s a lot of build-up and then things go crazy all at once. Taking home a newborn, like taking home an Oscar, turns life on its head. And forget about sleep. Ali\u2019s wife, the artist Amatus Sami-Karim, gave birth to their daughter, Bari, that February, and 100 frazzled hours later Ali was on stage at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, looking blinky and delighted, and bringing an audience of grandees to their feet when he croaked: \u201cI just wanna thank my wife.\u201d</p> <p>It was a week that changed everything for Ali. Until then he\u2019d been an auxiliary guy, a well-thought-of actor who didn\u2019t often get his name on the posters and who was probably best known for his regular appearances in Netflix\u2019s House Of Cards. Ali had a fun if slightly underwritten role as the Washington fixer Remy Danton, a job he quit when the show was at its peak \u2013 wanting to take one last shot at becoming a leading actor before it was too late. Moonlight, in which he was a taciturn drug dealer, a character who appeared only fleetingly but whose presence hung over the whole movie, suggested Ali had the chops for lead roles. The Oscar win in 2017 pushed him over the top, and in the two years since then Ali has juggled parenthood with work on two huge new productions due out this month \u2013 the third season of HBO\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/aug/27/true-detective-watch-mahershala-ali-in-the-trailer-for-the-long-awaited-third-season\" title=\"\">prestige procedural True Detective</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/03/peter-farrelly-green-book-mahershala-ali-viggo-mortensen\" title=\"\">awards-tipped biopic Green Book</a>, about the pioneering African American pianist Don Shirley.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5565d1a125e09abf725e703415f48308e5c4e21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5565d1a125e09abf725e703415f48308e5c4e21/346_0_4981_2991/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mahershala Ali in Green Book as the pianist Don Shirley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ali in Green Book as the pianist Don Shirley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal Pictures/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I want to talk to Ali about Green Book, a rich and affecting film which last week won best comedy or musical at the Golden Globes; Ali picked up the award for best supporting actor. But first, I\u2019m curious to know what happened <em>next</em> in the Ali family home, when a newborn and an Oscar came home within hours of each other.</p> <p>He considers his answer carefully. The actor is an observant Muslim, a thoughtful guy who speaks in long, unhurried sentences. Combined with today\u2019s outfit \u2013 a navy blue kimono-like gown, buttoned to the throat \u2013 it projects a potent sense of spiritual calm. Ali says that having the baby and the Oscar \u201cwas like a jigsaw puzzle which my wife and I had to try to put together. And as soon as we felt like we\u2019d figured it out, it changed. It took a lot of listening to each other. Reacting. Every now and then we had to hit a tuning fork, to make sure we were in sync.\u201d</p> <p>Green Book was based in New Orleans, where during filming the young Ali family were able to snatch some life together between days on set.

This will be the clip of Ali that gets shown during awards season, whenever they are running down the list of nominees \u2013 but, for me, it\u2019s his smaller moments in the film that linger. In one scene, Shirley is invited to a grand black-tie dinner party at which the host, imagining a great treat for his guest, reveals the evening\u2019s menu: fried chicken. And instead of walking out or protesting, Ali has Shirley hesitate for a moment \u2013 and then produce a beaming smile, showing exactly the gratitude that white society meant him to.</p> <p>I ask Ali about that pained smile, which prompts a personal story. \u201cThat smile... I think it has a bit to do with Shirley wanting to be comfortable. If <em>they\u2019re</em> not comfortable then <em>he</em> won\u2019t be comfortable. So many times, in my life, just living in New York city for a good bit of time... You\u2019re walking on the street a lot, you\u2019re on public transportation, you\u2019re travelling late at night. And I remember I was always really conscious of how I dressed. Like, I wouldn\u2019t wear clothes that allowed people to identify me with what I would think they would view as the typical black man. I wouldn\u2019t wear tennis shoes. It was a conscious thing, because I found that women would cross the street [to avoid me], day or night. Or turn their ring over on the subway \u2013 turn the diamond inward! These were little things I would catch all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Ali continues: \u201cHow people would react to a large, fairly muscular, dark-skinned black man \u2013 I would be <em>so</em> conscious of it and it would upset me. It would affect my energy for the rest of the day. So in order to protect myself from having to manage other people\u2019s fear, I would do things to preempt that. And <em>so many</em> black people around the world do this. Because there\u2019s an idea that we\u2019re something to be feared, or that we pose a danger.\u201d</p> <p>Shirley\u2019s forced smile in the movie? That\u2019s normal, Ali suggests: that\u2019s textbook. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of the tactics of a black person navigating a world that doesn\u2019t know how to react. You develop this habit of addressing a situation by communicating how <em>safe</em> you are.\u201d The actor puts out his hands in a helpless gesture: it is what it is, \u201cthe double consciousness that black people carry with them\u201d.</p> <p>***</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I went through a process of digging through different religions and ways of connecting to God.

She picked her son\u2019s name \u2013 Mahershalalhashbaz in full \u2013 out of the Bible. Mother and son lived in the Bay Area of California in what Ali describes as a \u201cprayerful home\u201d. His father, Phillip, was around for a few years, until he left the family in unusual circumstances. An amateur dancer, he was invited, in the late 1970s, to appear on a TV talent contest called Soul Train. He won, came home with a sports car, and then one day moved across America to try to get work in the theatre in New York. For about 20 years, until his death in the mid-1990s, Phillip appeared in the chorus line in Broadway musicals. Ali would occasionally visit. They cannot have seen each other often, because the actor once said he could count on 10 fingers the number of times the two of them were together. \u201cBut I always really respected and admired what my dad was doing,\u201d he tells me.</p> <p>Ali grew up close to his mother until he was in his early 20s, at which point there was a difficult breach over religion. \u201cWe lost a lot of years. Being in a relationship with God through Christianity had carried me for a period of time,\u201d he remembers. \u201cAnd then I felt like I needed to understand something deeper. So I went through a process of digging through different religions and philosophies, and ways of connecting to God. And that ended up being Islam for me.\u201d He converted at the start of 2000, changing his name from Gilmore to Ali. His mother was upset and many of his friends were politely confused. But on the whole, Ali recalls, \u201cit didn\u2019t necessarily seem that deep a thing to do. And then 9/11 happened.\u201d</p> <p>Moving through airports became difficult. After a few years of being taken aside at security gates, Ali learned that his name was on a watch list for air travel. Meanwhile, his wife, also a practising Muslim, had stopped wearing a headscarf on city streets: too much grief. There was trouble with the couple\u2019s bank account, their funds had been mysteriously frozen, Ali was told.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"144dc54a7fc9327a407b86e20fd477cd3c969f22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/144dc54a7fc9327a407b86e20fd477cd3c969f22/364_0_2555_1534/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In House of Cards with Molly Parker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In House of Cards with Molly Parker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having grown up with that \u201cdouble consciousness\u201d about his race, he watched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/21/moonlight-mahershala-ali-anti-islam-prejudice-black\" title=\"\">his religion become another thing</a> that conservatives in America flinched from. He wondered how it would affect his work and tells me he decided to compartmentalise his faith, keeping it separate from his burgeoning acting career, \u201cmaking sure the work was the work and my spiritual space was my spiritual space\u201d. In fact the two things \u2013 the work and the faith \u2013 were on a funny sort of collision course that would take years to play out.</p> <p>Ali might have been a professional basketballer, having once been good enough to earn a scholarship to a private college in California. He was OK, he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think I had the approach or mentality that would sustain a successful sporting career\u201d. As a student he\u2019d started writing poetry, sometimes performing it, and, \u201cI was sort of caught between the worlds, where I think my mentality was more suited for the arts over athletics.\u201d He enrolled on a graduate course in drama at New York University, and afterwards hung around long enough to play a boxer in an off-Broadway show, before moving to Los Angeles.</p> <p>His third-tier Hollywood career began on a TV drama called Crossing Jordan. (\u201cI was the black guy on the show,\u201d Ali once said. \u201cThat was kind of it.\u201d) More forgettable TV shows followed, and occasionally he got middle-size parts in middle-quality films, such as The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button and The Place Beyond The Pines. At one point he released a rap album. In 2012, vaguely hoping for a bounce in name recognition, he shortened that astonishing name from Mahershalalhashbaz to Mahershala. (Pronounced correctly it\u2019s Ma-HER-sha-la.) Between episodes of House Of Cards, he played a military grunt in a couple of Hunger Games movies. He\u2019d hoped for more.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was a person they felt enough respect for to honour with an award \u2013 well, I\u2019m not that different from the people not allowed into America</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The actor was in his agent\u2019s office when he first read the script for Moonlight, a heavily autobiographical work by the playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney about a Miami schoolboy called Chiron, persecuted for being gay. Ali was told there might be a part for him in the film as a drug dealer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/30/mahershala-ali-luke-cage-moonlight-hunger-games\" title=\"\">Juan, who becomes a father figure to Chiron</a>, and later said he had a \u201cvisceral reaction\u201d to the script. Shot by the director Barry Jenkins in late 2015, audiences had a similarly visceral reaction to Moonlight when it began to play at festivals in 2016, and the momentum continued through to Oscars night in 2017, Ali and his colleagues scooping up nominations at the Golden Globes, the Baftas and the Screen Actors Guild awards.</p> <p>The SAG ceremony took place in January 2017, at the end of a difficult weekend. President Trump had just unveiled the policy that became known as his \u201cMuslim travel ban\u201d. Ali had a lot going on in his life (the baby was due, the Oscar was due) and he could have been forgiven for ignoring the politics of the moment. But it was rare for a Muslim actor even to be nominated at these ceremonies, and on the way to the SAG awards he kept thinking about Trump\u2019s travel ban. The actor didn\u2019t fancy declaiming or fist-waving \u2013 not his style. At the same time he felt it worth pointing out that here he was, up for famous prizes, \u201cand if I was a person they felt enough respect for to honour with an award, well, I\u2019m not that different from those people that are not allowed to travel into the country\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33ae57e8b2bcc944e50ef7e4469a322f5539e817\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33ae57e8b2bcc944e50ef7e4469a322f5539e817/0_210_3300_1980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mahershala Ali in Moonlight with Alex R Hibbert\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ali in Moonlight with Alex R Hibbert.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Plan B Entertainment</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When he won, Ali wound up telling a story about his mother. Tender, as personal as it was political, the speech has since been viewed hundreds of thousands of times online. \u201cMy mother is an ordained minister,\u201d Ali said: \u201cI\u2019m a Muslim. She didn\u2019t do <em>backflips</em> when I called her to tell her I\u2019d converted 17 years ago. But I tell you now, you put things to the side [and] I\u2019m able to see her, she\u2019s able to see me, and we love each other.\u201d His was one of the first Muslim-American voices the country heard that weekend, certainly from within the arts, and it was a powerful moment. Talking softly from the podium about the particular pain of persecution that comes from within one\u2019s own community, Ali\u2019s voice cracked as he said: \u201cI hope that we do a better job.\u201d</p> <p>Two years on, it isn\u2019t clear we <em>are</em> doing a better job. The US is full of renewed talk of a border wall. Europe is racking itself over Brexit. The #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements have helped expose even graver social ills than were previously acknowledged. I ask Ali: if he were to get back up on a winner\u2019s podium with this new film, would he speak to the political moment again?</p> <p>Characteristically, he takes a moment to consider this. He doesn\u2019t say yes, he doesn\u2019t say no. His daughter, born in Oscars week, is now two years old and Ali offers up a lesson he\u2019s learned from parenting her. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you get to say to them, \u2018Hey! Don\u2019t touch that hot stove!\u2019 And then they never touch the stove again. You\u2019ve got to keep drilling the message, right? You\u2019ve got to carry on the conversation until they grow into a state of consciousness where they understand.\u201d So we\u2019re only at the beginning, Ali thinks. \u201cIt\u2019s a conversation that\u2019s gonna go on for a while yet.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Green Book is released in the UK on 30 January.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 January 2019 to correct some inaccuracies. Ali filmed Green Book before True Detective not after, and an incorrect reference to Ali\u2019s previous auditions has been removed. An earlier version said that Mahershala Ali telephoned the Shirley family to apologise for not consulting them on Green Book; Ali was unaware that Don Shirley had close surviving relatives at the time of filming. After filming, Ali called them to apologise for any offence caused.<br><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Exactly two years ago, in early 2017, the actor Mahershala Ali and his wife were about to give birth \u2013 one after the other. \u201cIt\u2019s something we still joke about,\u201d says the 44-year-old American, sitting in a London hotel, smiling at the memory. \u201cMy wife was pregnant with a baby. And I was pregnant with an Oscar.\u201d The actor knows that sounds glib. He knows that however exciting or worked-for an industry prize \u2013 Ali won his best supporting actor award that year for a standout performance in the coming-of-age drama Moonlight \u2013 nothing compares to the graft of bearing an actual child. But aspects of the comparison stand. There\u2019s a lot of build-up and then things go crazy all at once. Taking home a newborn, like taking home an Oscar, turns life on its head. And forget about sleep. Ali\u2019s wife, the artist Amatus Sami-Karim, gave birth to their daughter, Bari, that February, and 100 frazzled hours later Ali was on stage at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, looking blinky and delighted, and bringing an audience of grandees to their feet when he croaked: \u201cI just wanna thank my wife.\u201d It was a week that changed everything for Ali. Until then he\u2019d been an auxiliary guy, a well-thought-of actor who didn\u2019t often get his name on the posters and who was probably best known for his regular appearances in Netflix\u2019s House Of Cards. Ali had a fun if slightly underwritten role as the Washington fixer Remy Danton, a job he quit when the show was at its peak \u2013 wanting to take one last shot at becoming a leading actor before it was too late. Moonlight, in which he was a taciturn drug dealer, a character who appeared only fleetingly but whose presence hung over the whole movie, suggested Ali had the chops for lead roles. The Oscar win in 2017 pushed him over the top, and in the two years since then Ali has juggled parenthood with work on two huge new productions due out this month \u2013 the third season of HBO\u2019s prestige procedural True Detective and the awards-tipped biopic Green Book, about the pioneering African American pianist Don Shirley. I want to talk to Ali about Green Book, a rich and affecting film which last week won best comedy or musical at the Golden Globes; Ali picked up the award for best supporting actor. But first, I\u2019m curious to know what happened next in the Ali family home, when a newborn and an Oscar came home within hours of each other. He considers his answer carefully. The actor is an observant Muslim, a thoughtful guy who speaks in long, unhurried sentences. Combined with today\u2019s outfit \u2013 a navy blue kimono-like gown, buttoned to the throat \u2013 it projects a potent sense of spiritual calm. Ali says that having the baby and the Oscar \u201cwas like a jigsaw puzzle which my wife and I had to try to put together. And as soon as we felt like we\u2019d figured it out, it changed. It took a lot of listening to each other. Reacting. Every now and then we had to hit a tuning fork, to make sure we were in sync.\u201d Green Book was based in New Orleans, where during filming the young Ali family were able to snatch some life together between days on set. After that, he was straight on to a 10-month shoot on True Detective; Ali\u2019s wife and daughter travelled from the family home in Los Angeles to the set in Arkansas as often as possible. And after that? Ali says he just stopped saying yes to jobs. His wife needed time for her own career as an artist. The couple hit the tuning fork \u2013 and the tuning fork said it was blatantly her turn. They moved back to Los Angeles. \u201cYou get to the point where you think: \u2018If I were to accept the next thing I\u2019d be throwing off the balance of my family.\u2019\u201d Ali talks a lot about balance. Central to the appeal of playing Don Shirley in Green Book was that here was a historical figure all out of whack, a man blessed with enormous musical talent but with no clear place in the world he inhabited. Shirley rose to prominence in New York in the 1960s, becoming such a fixture at Carnegie Hall that he ended up living in a grand apartment above the main auditorium. \u201cThe more he had, the more he attained,\u201d Ali says. \u201cHe still couldn\u2019t get away from his isolated existence, because he was sort of a man beyond his time. You think about the Michael Jacksons of the world, the Princes, people so exceptional and extraordinary they almost have alien status.\u201d Green Book, which also stars Viggo Mortensen, plays out as a road movie. Mortensen is Tony \u201cLip\u201d Vallelonga, an Italian-American bodyguard who is hired by Shirley to provide protection on a risky tour through the Jim Crow-era South. The film is based on real-life events, though both Shirley and Vallelonga have since died, and controversy brewed last year when Shirley\u2019s surviving relatives questioned Green Book\u2019s accuracy. Was the musician really such an aloof figure, estranged from his family, from mainstream black culture, from the black politics of the era, as Green Book insists? Shirley\u2019s brother and nephew wondered why they hadn\u2019t figured in the writing or the production of the film, calling it \u201ca symphony of lies\u201d, while Vallelonga\u2019s son has a screenwriting credit. Late last year, Ali telephoned the Shirley family to apologise for any offence. What seems beyond question is that the pianist was a man who struggled to fit in. Ali\u2019s take is that \u201che was someone who was not black enough for the black community. He was not white enough to be accepted in his profession. And he was not ready to be embraced by society because of how he identified sexually.\u201d Towards the end of the movie, the actor delivers a big, weepy scene in the rain in which Shirley opens up, about what it is to be black and gay, and so doubly inferior in the eyes of 1960s society. This will be the clip of Ali that gets shown during awards season, whenever they are running down the list of nominees \u2013 but, for me, it\u2019s his smaller moments in the film that linger.

You develop this habit of addressing a situation by communicating how safe you are.\u201d The actor puts out his hands in a helpless gesture: it is what it is, \u201cthe double consciousness that black people carry with them\u201d. *** Ali\u2019s mother, Willicia, was the daughter of a Christian minister, and later became one herself.

Having grown up with that \u201cdouble consciousness\u201d about his race, he watched his religion become another thing that conservatives in America flinched from. He wondered how it would affect his work and tells me he decided to compartmentalise his faith, keeping it separate from his burgeoning acting career, \u201cmaking sure the work was the work and my spiritual space was my spiritual space\u201d. In fact the two things \u2013 the work and the faith \u2013 were on a funny sort of collision course that would take years to play out. Ali might have been a professional basketballer, having once been good enough to earn a scholarship to a private college in California. He was OK, he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think I had the approach or mentality that would sustain a successful sporting career\u201d. As a student he\u2019d started writing poetry, sometimes performing it, and, \u201cI was sort of caught between the worlds, where I think my mentality was more suited for the arts over athletics.\u201d He enrolled on a graduate course in drama at New York University, and afterwards hung around long enough to play a boxer in an off-Broadway show, before moving to Los Angeles. His third-tier Hollywood career began on a TV drama called Crossing Jordan. (\u201cI was the black guy on the show,\u201d Ali once said. \u201cThat was kind of it.\u201d) More forgettable TV shows followed, and occasionally he got middle-size parts in middle-quality films, such as The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button and The Place Beyond The Pines. At one point he released a rap album. In 2012, vaguely hoping for a bounce in name recognition, he shortened that astonishing name from Mahershalalhashbaz to Mahershala. (Pronounced correctly it\u2019s Ma-HER-sha-la.) Between episodes of House Of Cards, he played a military grunt in a couple of Hunger Games movies. He\u2019d hoped for more. The actor was in his agent\u2019s office when he first read the script for Moonlight, a heavily autobiographical work by the playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney about a Miami schoolboy called Chiron, persecuted for being gay. Ali was told there might be a part for him in the film as a drug dealer, Juan, who becomes a father figure to Chiron, and later said he had a \u201cvisceral reaction\u201d to the script. Shot by the director Barry Jenkins in late 2015, audiences had a similarly visceral reaction to Moonlight when it began to play at festivals in 2016, and the momentum continued through to Oscars night in 2017, Ali and his colleagues scooping up nominations at the Golden Globes, the Baftas and the Screen Actors Guild awards. The SAG ceremony took place in January 2017, at the end of a difficult weekend. President Trump had just unveiled the policy that became known as his \u201cMuslim travel ban\u201d. Ali had a lot going on in his life (the baby was due, the Oscar was due) and he could have been forgiven for ignoring the politics of the moment. But it was rare for a Muslim actor even to be nominated at these ceremonies, and on the way to the SAG awards he kept thinking about Trump\u2019s travel ban. The actor didn\u2019t fancy declaiming or fist-waving \u2013 not his style. At the same time he felt it worth pointing out that here he was, up for famous prizes, \u201cand if I was a person they felt enough respect for to honour with an award, well, I\u2019m not that different from those people that are not allowed to travel into the country\u201d. When he won, Ali wound up telling a story about his mother. Tender, as personal as it was political, the speech has since been viewed hundreds of thousands of times online. \u201cMy mother is an ordained minister,\u201d Ali said: \u201cI\u2019m a Muslim. She didn\u2019t do backflips when I called her to tell her I\u2019d converted 17 years ago. But I tell you now, you put things to the side [and] I\u2019m able to see her, she\u2019s able to see me, and we love each other.\u201d His was one of the first Muslim-American voices the country heard that weekend, certainly from within the arts, and it was a powerful moment. Talking softly from the podium about the particular pain of persecution that comes from within one\u2019s own community, Ali\u2019s voice cracked as he said: \u201cI hope that we do a better job.\u201d Two years on, it isn\u2019t clear we are doing a better job. The US is full of renewed talk of a border wall. Europe is racking itself over Brexit. The #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements have helped expose even graver social ills than were previously acknowledged. I ask Ali: if he were to get back up on a winner\u2019s podium with this new film, would he speak to the political moment again? Characteristically, he takes a moment to consider this. He doesn\u2019t say yes, he doesn\u2019t say no. His daughter, born in Oscars week, is now two years old and Ali offers up a lesson he\u2019s learned from parenting her. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you get to say to them, \u2018Hey! Don\u2019t touch that hot stove!\u2019 And then they never touch the stove again. You\u2019ve got to keep drilling the message, right? You\u2019ve got to carry on the conversation until they grow into a state of consciousness where they understand.\u201d So we\u2019re only at the beginning, Ali thinks. \u201cIt\u2019s a conversation that\u2019s gonna go on for a while yet.\u201d \u2022 Green Book is released in the UK on 30 January. \u2022 This article was amended on 16 January 2019 to correct some inaccuracies. Ali filmed Green Book before True Detective not after, and an incorrect reference to Ali\u2019s previous auditions has been removed. An earlier version said that Mahershala Ali telephoned the Shirley family to apologise for not consulting them on Green Book; Ali was unaware that Don Shirley had close surviving relatives at the time of filming. After filming, Ali called them to apologise for any offence caused.",

The only game in which Chelsea\u2019s opponents have scored was when Arsenal visited Kingsmeadow in October and ran riot, winning 5-0. It was par for the course for Joe Montemurro\u2019s side, whose first six league games this season ended with an outrageously one-sided aggregate scoreline of 31-3, with only West Ham breaching their defence \u2013 and they still lost 4-3. Where Chelsea have failed to shut out their opponents only once, there has been just one occasion when Arsenal have failed to score. While there has been a bit of a defensive drop-off of late, with one clean sheet in their last five WSL fixtures, they have still won four of them. Arsenal finished third last season, seven points behind Chelsea and one away from Manchester City, and the games between those teams will inevitably have an enormous impact on this year\u2019s table. Chelsea remain in search of their first win in this mini-league, while so far Arsenal have comfortably won one before, like the leaders in the men\u2019s Premier League, finally losing their unbeaten record in Manchester.

      "body": "<p>In 1765 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2014/jan/20/rousseau-compassionate-intense-relevant-philosopher\" title=\"\">Jean-Jacques Rousseau </a>spent two months on a Swiss island dedicating himself to \u201cmy precious <em>far niente</em>\u201d (doing nothing). He loafed about, gathering plants, drifting in a boat, sitting for hours in a \u201cdelicious reverie \u2026 pleasurably aware of my existence without troubling myself with thought\u201d: an idleness that he later described as the most \u201ccomplete and perfect happiness\u201d of his life.</p> <p>Rousseau is one of the heroes of <em>Not Working</em>, alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/10/henry-david-thoreau-a-life-by-laura-dassow-walls-review\" title=\"\">Thoreau</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/emilydickinson\" title=\"\">Emily Dickinson</a> and a rabbit named Rr that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/04/josh-cohen-psychology-slacker-work-burnout\" title=\"\">Josh Cohen</a> once briefly looked after. The book opens with Rr shuffling around his hutch, his mindless serenity triggering an empathic recognition in Cohen of his own \u201csecret, self-enclosed blankness\u201d, his frequent bouts of \u201clapine reverie\u201d. Like Rousseau on his island, Rr does not do, he merely is. His passivity calls out to Cohen, who at various points in his book describes himself as a slob, a slacker, a layabout. As a child he was regularly chastised for laziness; as an adult, every day brings its moment of <em>far niente</em>: \u201cIt usually happens at night, when I\u2019m slouched on the sofa \u2026 my book lies face down, my shoes are kicked off; next to me are two remote controls, a bowl of peanuts and a half-empty beer bottle \u2026 Raising myself from this lethargy \u2026 feels like a physical, even a metaphysical disturbance, a violation of cosmic justice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d The childish protest is disarming; we picture Cohen\u2019s inner bunny strapped to a treadmill or, worse still, turned into a very different rabbit: the Duracell bunny, whose \u201cclockwork motion\u201d and \u201cdead-eyed grin\u201d makes him a perfect symbol for the relentless busyness of modern life, its \u201cconstant, nervous compulsion to activity\u201d that Cohen resents and resists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1cde8ccb9dccca929103bac1793f123366bb4fa1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cde8ccb9dccca929103bac1793f123366bb4fa1/0_311_3576_2146/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jean-Jacques Rousseau.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lebrecht Music &amp; Arts/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Not Working</em> is a polemic against our overwork culture and a meditation on its alternatives. \u201cWhat, if not work, makes life worth living?\u201d Cohen is a psychoanalyst. Every day his consulting room resounds with stories of unremitting activity, exhaustion, breakdown; \u201cfantasies of a complete cessation of doing\u201d. Some of these storytellers appear in the book, carefully disguised, in company with a host of other anti-workers, actual and fictional, including the Greek philosopher Pyrrho, Homer Simpson and Cohen himself at various phases in his life. The cast is mostly male and grouped into four \u201cinertial types\u201d: the burnout, the slob, the daydreamer, the slacker. Some crash into inertia; others, like Cohen, sink into it. All, it turns out, are risk-takers, since \u201cin resisting work \u2026 each type is liable to fall into one or more impasse\u201d: debilitating lassitude, depression, loneliness, boredom. <em>Far niente</em>, in other words, has its price, which for some people, including the three men whose stories Cohen highlights \u2013 Andy Warhol, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/orsonwelles\" title=\"\">Orson Welles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/10/karen-green-david-foster-wallace-interview\" title=\"\">David Foster Wallace</a> \u2013 can be very high.</p> <p>Warhol yearned for what the Stoics called <em>apatheia</em> (passionlessness), a longing that resulted in a machine-like numbness, a state of \u201cbeing and feeling nothing\u201d, in which ferocious mechanical activity alternated with inertial collapse: a Duracell bunny with his batteries flat. Welles combined Herculean exertions with lengthy retreats to his bed, which became more frequent as his body and mind gave way under his crazed lifestyle. Foster Wallace\u2019s dazzling literary career was punctuated by periods when he lay slumped in front of the TV struggling with acute depression: a deathly torpidity that terminated in suicide. Cohen types these men differently (Warhol the burnout, Welles the slob, Foster Wallace the slacker) but what is striking about all three is how the flight from hyperactivity into self-destructive inertia involves a move into radical solitude, <em>far niente</em> as malignant isolation.</p> <p>Solitude has long been associated with depressive enervation. Medieval spiritual solitaries were said to suffer from <em>acedia</em>, a melancholic sluggishness of mind and body. \u201cBe not solitary, be not idle,\u201d the 17th-century scholar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/18/anatomy-melancholy-robert-burton-100-best-nonfiction-books\" title=\"\">Robert Burton</a> counselled in his hugely influential <em>The</em> <em>Anatomy of Melancholy</em> (1621). Modern psychiatry regards reclusiveness as pathological and many of Cohen\u2019s fellow psychoanalysts concur. He rejects this, turning instead to the alternative tradition, dating back to the Renaissance, that values solitude as a setting for creativity. The postwar analyst <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/dec/16/enduring-lessons-of-donald-winnicotts-toy-story\" title=\"\">Donald Winnicott </a>was an eloquent spokesman for this tradition. For Winnicott \u201ccreativity depended on maintaining contact with the \u2018still, silent spot\u2019 at the heart of the psyche\u201d: an insight exemplified for Cohen by the famously reclusive Emily Dickinson, whose retirement from society into the \u201cboundless confines of her own room and head\u201d liberated her to produce poetry of dazzling originality. Renouncing sexual love and marriage for the \u201cpolar privacy\u201d of her inner life, \u201cin the eyes of the world she was \u2018doing nothing\u2019, while in her own mind she was \u2018doing everything\u2019, travelling fearlessly to the furthest extremes of possible experience.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Daydreaming for Dickinson was not a retreat into listless inactivity, but the basis for the highest vocation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a brilliant set of readings, Cohen shows how this fearless voyaging produced a poetry that moved between shattering images of acedia and ecstatic evocations of unconsummated desire, Dickinson\u2019s \u201cprivate and invisible glory\u201d. Dreaming and the products of dreaming trumped constraining actuality. \u201cDaydreaming for Dickinson was not a retreat into listless inactivity, but the basis for the highest vocation.\u201d</p> <p>Cohen\u2019s treatment of Dickinson is revealing. The slobs and slackers that populate <em>Not Working</em> are men after his heart, but it\u2019s the artist who is his ideal, disdaining real-world activity (\u201cprose\u201d was Dickinson\u2019s sniffy label for this) for the life of the imagination. An artist \u201cdoes nothing\u201d, produces nothing \u201cuseful\u201d, and in this she embodies the \u201csabbatical dimension of us human beings\u201d, the richest part of ourselves. But does this make the artist an \u201cinertial type\u201d?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2340a8b0cf460685d13edda1bf028921f71ed092\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2340a8b0cf460685d13edda1bf028921f71ed092/0_0_2100_2884/728.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Dickinson.\" width=\"728\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily Dickinson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his <em>Confessions</em> Rousseau wrote \u201cThe idleness I love is not that of a do-nothing who stays with his arms crossed in totally inactivity,\u201d but \u201cthat of a child who is ceaselessly in motion\u201d. Play is also not work, but it is anything but inert. For Winnicott, play was the primal creative experience, the source of all adult creativity. Cohen is keen on Winnicott so it\u2019s interesting that he doesn\u2019t mention it, unlike Tracey Emin who in a 2010 interview described childhood play as the wellspring of her art. In an illuminating discussion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/27/tracey-emin-my-bed-violent-mess-sex-death\" title=\"\">Emin\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/27/tracey-emin-my-bed-violent-mess-sex-death\" title=\"\">My Bed</a></em>, Cohen praises the work for its powerful portrayal of \u201cinertia and lassitude\u201d. But unlike the inertia of the men he discusses, Emin herself seems to go from strength to strength. Perhaps playing is the secret?</p> <p>Emin and Dickinson are among the few women who appear in <em>Not Working</em>. We read about their artistic representation of female inertia but meet no female sluggards or layabouts. So what are women doing while men are lazing about? A closer look at Cohen\u2019s favourite idlers \u2013 Rousseau, Thoreau, Homer Simpson \u2013 gives us a clue. Rousseau\u2019s days of <em>far niente</em> were punctuated by meals prepared by his wife. Thoreau\u2019s laundry was done by his mother. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jun/10/doh-homer-simpson-leaves-marge-for-lena-dunham-for-one-episode\" title=\"\">Marge Simpson </a>does the housework while Homer swills beer in front of the TV. What kind of revolution would it take to put Marge in front of the TV while Homer cleans the kitchen?</p> <p>The battle against overwork has gone on for centuries (joined more recently by feminist protests against the \u201cdouble shift\u201d). So too have struggles for decent work, decently paid, of the kind that Cohen and I both enjoy. Yet today real-life Marges dash between their homes and their minimum-wage jobs at Asda. Homers do 12-hour stints driving for Uber. If they burn out, as many people do, they often find themselves in food banks. What to do about this?</p> <p>\u201cIdiorrhythmy\u201d was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/roland-barthes\" title=\"\">Roland Barthes</a>\u2019s term for living according to one\u2019s inner rhythms, free from compulsion. Cohen wants us to imagine what such a life would be like. He\u2019s sceptical about agendas for change that fail to do this, arguing that if \u201cthe aims of legal, political and economic justice are isolated from the question of what makes a life worth living they are liable to become just another set of items on \u2026 a joyless to-do list\u201d. Along with work-related rights we need a right not to work, he argued recently. It\u2019s a utopian argument and no worse for that, although weakened by an ironic dismissal of all political action in favour of slacking and sloth. But <em>Not Working</em> is no revolutionary manifesto. Rather, it\u2019s a highly personal, eloquent reimagining of our lives as a space for <em>far niente</em> in all its unfettered idiosyncrasy, and a valuable reminder of the exorbitant price of a Duracell bunny existence.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Not Working </em>is published by Granta.

      "bodyText": "In 1765 Jean-Jacques Rousseau spent two months on a Swiss island dedicating himself to \u201cmy precious far niente\u201d (doing nothing). He loafed about, gathering plants, drifting in a boat, sitting for hours in a \u201cdelicious reverie \u2026 pleasurably aware of my existence without troubling myself with thought\u201d: an idleness that he later described as the most \u201ccomplete and perfect happiness\u201d of his life. Rousseau is one of the heroes of Not Working, alongside Thoreau, Emily Dickinson and a rabbit named Rr that Josh Cohen once briefly looked after. The book opens with Rr shuffling around his hutch, his mindless serenity triggering an empathic recognition in Cohen of his own \u201csecret, self-enclosed blankness\u201d, his frequent bouts of \u201clapine reverie\u201d. Like Rousseau on his island, Rr does not do, he merely is. His passivity calls out to Cohen, who at various points in his book describes himself as a slob, a slacker, a layabout. As a child he was regularly chastised for laziness; as an adult, every day brings its moment of far niente: \u201cIt usually happens at night, when I\u2019m slouched on the sofa \u2026 my book lies face down, my shoes are kicked off; next to me are two remote controls, a bowl of peanuts and a half-empty beer bottle \u2026 Raising myself from this lethargy \u2026 feels like a physical, even a metaphysical disturbance, a violation of cosmic justice.\u201d \u201cWhy should I?\u201d The childish protest is disarming; we picture Cohen\u2019s inner bunny strapped to a treadmill or, worse still, turned into a very different rabbit: the Duracell bunny, whose \u201cclockwork motion\u201d and \u201cdead-eyed grin\u201d makes him a perfect symbol for the relentless busyness of modern life, its \u201cconstant, nervous compulsion to activity\u201d that Cohen resents and resists. Not Working is a polemic against our overwork culture and a meditation on its alternatives. \u201cWhat, if not work, makes life worth living?\u201d Cohen is a psychoanalyst. Every day his consulting room resounds with stories of unremitting activity, exhaustion, breakdown; \u201cfantasies of a complete cessation of doing\u201d. Some of these storytellers appear in the book, carefully disguised, in company with a host of other anti-workers, actual and fictional, including the Greek philosopher Pyrrho, Homer Simpson and Cohen himself at various phases in his life. The cast is mostly male and grouped into four \u201cinertial types\u201d: the burnout, the slob, the daydreamer, the slacker. Some crash into inertia; others, like Cohen, sink into it. All, it turns out, are risk-takers, since \u201cin resisting work \u2026 each type is liable to fall into one or more impasse\u201d: debilitating lassitude, depression, loneliness, boredom. Far niente, in other words, has its price, which for some people, including the three men whose stories Cohen highlights \u2013 Andy Warhol, Orson Welles and David Foster Wallace \u2013 can be very high. Warhol yearned for what the Stoics called apatheia (passionlessness), a longing that resulted in a machine-like numbness, a state of \u201cbeing and feeling nothing\u201d, in which ferocious mechanical activity alternated with inertial collapse: a Duracell bunny with his batteries flat. Welles combined Herculean exertions with lengthy retreats to his bed, which became more frequent as his body and mind gave way under his crazed lifestyle. Foster Wallace\u2019s dazzling literary career was punctuated by periods when he lay slumped in front of the TV struggling with acute depression: a deathly torpidity that terminated in suicide. Cohen types these men differently (Warhol the burnout, Welles the slob, Foster Wallace the slacker) but what is striking about all three is how the flight from hyperactivity into self-destructive inertia involves a move into radical solitude, far niente as malignant isolation. Solitude has long been associated with depressive enervation. Medieval spiritual solitaries were said to suffer from acedia, a melancholic sluggishness of mind and body. \u201cBe not solitary, be not idle,\u201d the 17th-century scholar Robert Burton counselled in his hugely influential The Anatomy of Melancholy (1621). Modern psychiatry regards reclusiveness as pathological and many of Cohen\u2019s fellow psychoanalysts concur. He rejects this, turning instead to the alternative tradition, dating back to the Renaissance, that values solitude as a setting for creativity. The postwar analyst Donald Winnicott was an eloquent spokesman for this tradition. For Winnicott \u201ccreativity depended on maintaining contact with the \u2018still, silent spot\u2019 at the heart of the psyche\u201d: an insight exemplified for Cohen by the famously reclusive Emily Dickinson, whose retirement from society into the \u201cboundless confines of her own room and head\u201d liberated her to produce poetry of dazzling originality. Renouncing sexual love and marriage for the \u201cpolar privacy\u201d of her inner life, \u201cin the eyes of the world she was \u2018doing nothing\u2019, while in her own mind she was \u2018doing everything\u2019, travelling fearlessly to the furthest extremes of possible experience.\u201d In a brilliant set of readings, Cohen shows how this fearless voyaging produced a poetry that moved between shattering images of acedia and ecstatic evocations of unconsummated desire, Dickinson\u2019s \u201cprivate and invisible glory\u201d. Dreaming and the products of dreaming trumped constraining actuality. \u201cDaydreaming for Dickinson was not a retreat into listless inactivity, but the basis for the highest vocation.\u201d Cohen\u2019s treatment of Dickinson is revealing. The slobs and slackers that populate Not Working are men after his heart, but it\u2019s the artist who is his ideal, disdaining real-world activity (\u201cprose\u201d was Dickinson\u2019s sniffy label for this) for the life of the imagination. An artist \u201cdoes nothing\u201d, produces nothing \u201cuseful\u201d, and in this she embodies the \u201csabbatical dimension of us human beings\u201d, the richest part of ourselves. But does this make the artist an \u201cinertial type\u201d? In his Confessions Rousseau wrote \u201cThe idleness I love is not that of a do-nothing who stays with his arms crossed in totally inactivity,\u201d but \u201cthat of a child who is ceaselessly in motion\u201d. Play is also not work, but it is anything but inert. For Winnicott, play was the primal creative experience, the source of all adult creativity. Cohen is keen on Winnicott so it\u2019s interesting that he doesn\u2019t mention it, unlike Tracey Emin who in a 2010 interview described childhood play as the wellspring of her art. In an illuminating discussion of Emin\u2019s My Bed, Cohen praises the work for its powerful portrayal of \u201cinertia and lassitude\u201d. But unlike the inertia of the men he discusses, Emin herself seems to go from strength to strength. Perhaps playing is the secret? Emin and Dickinson are among the few women who appear in Not Working. We read about their artistic representation of female inertia but meet no female sluggards or layabouts. So what are women doing while men are lazing about? A closer look at Cohen\u2019s favourite idlers \u2013 Rousseau, Thoreau, Homer Simpson \u2013 gives us a clue. Rousseau\u2019s days of far niente were punctuated by meals prepared by his wife. Thoreau\u2019s laundry was done by his mother. Marge Simpson does the housework while Homer swills beer in front of the TV. What kind of revolution would it take to put Marge in front of the TV while Homer cleans the kitchen? The battle against overwork has gone on for centuries (joined more recently by feminist protests against the \u201cdouble shift\u201d). So too have struggles for decent work, decently paid, of the kind that Cohen and I both enjoy. Yet today real-life Marges dash between their homes and their minimum-wage jobs at Asda. Homers do 12-hour stints driving for Uber. If they burn out, as many people do, they often find themselves in food banks. What to do about this? \u201cIdiorrhythmy\u201d was Roland Barthes\u2019s term for living according to one\u2019s inner rhythms, free from compulsion. Cohen wants us to imagine what such a life would be like. He\u2019s sceptical about agendas for change that fail to do this, arguing that if \u201cthe aims of legal, political and economic justice are isolated from the question of what makes a life worth living they are liable to become just another set of items on \u2026 a joyless to-do list\u201d. Along with work-related rights we need a right not to work, he argued recently. It\u2019s a utopian argument and no worse for that, although weakened by an ironic dismissal of all political action in favour of slacking and sloth. But Not Working is no revolutionary manifesto. Rather, it\u2019s a highly personal, eloquent reimagining of our lives as a space for far niente in all its unfettered idiosyncrasy, and a valuable reminder of the exorbitant price of a Duracell bunny existence. \u2022 Not Working is published by Granta.

Sasha Ryazantsev, the club\u2019s chief finance officer, informed shareholders that match-day revenue at Goodison was not only less than at the established top six but also West Ham \u2013 at Upton Park \u2013 and Southampton in the smaller capacity St Mary\u2019s Stadium. \u201cThe delivery of a new stadium, quite frankly, has nothing to do with my vision,\u201d Moshiri said. \u201cIt is a necessity.\u201d All who shared the stage with Everton\u2019s majority shareholder, with the exception of Brands and Silva, were at the club when his initial, heavy investment in players was squandered. Several have since been promoted with the highest-earning director\u2019s pay rising from \u00a3578,000 in 2017 to \u00a3917,000 in 2018. Moshiri has been remarkably patient with his executives compared with his managers. Silva, a \u201cbig bet\u201d as the billionaire described him, must hope stability in the dugout is viewed as a necessity, too.",

Theresa May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal.</p>\n    <p> As a result, the EU insists on having its own backstop - the backstop to the backstop - which would mean Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free trade deal, prompting fierce objections from Conservative hard Brexiters and the DUP, which props up her government.</p>\n    <p> That prompted May to propose a country-wide alternative in which the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the customs union after Brexit.</p>\n    <p> \u201cThe EU still requires a \u2018backstop to the backstop\u2019 \u2013 effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy. And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed,\u201d May told MPs.</p>\n    <p> Raising the stakes, the prime minister said the EU\u2019s insistence amounted to a threat to the constitution of the UK: \u201cWe have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom,\u201d she added.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>While Ireland had no say in the Brexit referendum, Bruton said, the result had an impact on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/05/good-friday-agreement-20-britain-ireland-peace-process\">Good Friday agreement</a>, which brought peace to the island in 1998.</p> \n<p>He pointed out the agreement also involved a referendum in the Irish Republic, in which voters agreed to abandon the claim on the six counties in the written Irish constitution, which has existed since partition almost 100 years ago. This, he said, meant the constitution of the union between Northern Ireland and Great Britain was not threatened by the backstop, as has been claimed.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/15/dup-brexit-pressure-grows-countdown-to-disaster\">Pressure grows on stubborn DUP to avoid Brexit \u2018countdown to disaster\u2019</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Hattersley \u2013 due to speak alongside the former Labour cabinet minister Margaret Beckett and the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, \u2013 will say later on Saturday that there is \u201cno conceivable deal which is remotely as beneficial to Great Britain as full membership of the European Union\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cJeremy Corbyn promised the party that policy would be made by the membership.

He said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Labour members wanted the party to campaign for a new referendum if Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s calls for an early general election to break the Brexit impasse did not materialise. Hattersley, 86, who was a minister in the Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan governments, will declare his support for the People\u2019s Vote campaign in a speech in Sheffield on Saturday. Parliamentary support for a second referendum is unlikely to be tested until after next week\u2019s crucial vote, as campaigners weigh up the best moment to try to win over the Labour leadership. However, Hattersley\u2019s support will be seen as a significant intervention. The former deputy Labour leader is expected to tell Corbyn to \u201cput out of his mind all the outdated nonsense about a socialist economy being impossible in Europe\u201d. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Saturday morning that \u201csometimes, you just have to do what is right\u201d. He said it was clear that no deal was the worst possible scenario and needed to be averted, and dismissed controversial claims by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, that blocking Brexit could \u201copen the door\u201d to extremist political forces. Grayling told the Daily Mail British politics would take on a different tone if the UK failed to leave the EU, predicting a \u201cless tolerant society\u201d and a \u201cmore nationalistic nation\u201d. \u201cIt will open the door to extremist populist political forces in this country of the kind we see in other countries in Europe,\u201d Grayling said. \u201cIf MPs who represent seats that voted 70% to leave say \u2018sorry guys, we\u2019re still going to have freedom of movement\u2019, they will turn against the political mainstream.\u201d Hattersley said: \u201cI don\u2019t think many people would regard Chris Grayling as an expert on these matters or, indeed, on anything.\u201d The transport secretary\u2019s comments came after the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, said a no-deal exit would create a \u201cfeeling of unrest\u201d. She told BBC News Northern Ireland: \u201cI have been clear that I believe no deal is bad for the United Kingdom, it\u2019s bad for the whole United Kingdom because it does put in jeopardy some of those constitutional arrangements.\u201d The former Irish taoiseach John Bruton told the Today programme the border backstop arrangement, which the Democratic Unionist party wants removed from the withdrawal agreement before it will support it, could not be dropped. He said it would be like Ireland cancelling its insurance policy. While Ireland had no say in the Brexit referendum, Bruton said, the result had an impact on the Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to the island in 1998. He pointed out the agreement also involved a referendum in the Irish Republic, in which voters agreed to abandon the claim on the six counties in the written Irish constitution, which has existed since partition almost 100 years ago. This, he said, meant the constitution of the union between Northern Ireland and Great Britain was not threatened by the backstop, as has been claimed. Hattersley \u2013 due to speak alongside the former Labour cabinet minister Margaret Beckett and the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, \u2013 will say later on Saturday that there is \u201cno conceivable deal which is remotely as beneficial to Great Britain as full membership of the European Union\u201d. \u201cJeremy Corbyn promised the party that policy would be made by the membership. Conference resolutions would, he said, be implemented. \u201cThat means he must, difficult as it may be, put out of his mind all the outdated nonsense about a socialist economy being impossible in Europe. \u201cThe vast majority of party members now expect that when the hope of an early general election is extinguished, Labour will campaign for a people\u2019s vote,\u201d he will say. He will warn that young people in the UK will \u201cpay the price\u201d of Brexit, while the elderly would be protected from the long-term \u201cpenalties\u201d. \u201cNone of us \u2013 and that includes the leadership of the Labour party \u2013 ought to waste our time talking about another renegotiation. \u201cSupport for a people\u2019s vote on Britain\u2019s future grows stronger every day. If it were backed by the Labour party, and in consequence, by the progressive trade unions, the idea would be irresistible. \u201cThe people\u2019s vote must enfranchise the young \u2013 not because they are passionately in favour of a European future, but because the Europe we build this year will belong to them. \u201cThe elderly \u2013 people like me \u2013 would be protected from the long-term penalties of leaving the union, or hovering half in, half out. \u201cWe can rely for a year or two on the prosperity which is bequeathed to us by 40 years of European membership. It is the young who will pay the price if Little England rises from the dead \u2013 reduced job opportunities, a retarded rate of economic growth and investment diverted from Britain to tariff-free markets.\u201d The Tory former minister Anna Soubry and the Labour MP for Wakefield, Mary Creagh, will also speak at the event as part of the People\u2019s Vote campaign\u2019s national Day of Action.",

Humans have been looking up at the stars for thousands of years, but modern telescopes and computers are rapidly accelerating our understanding. We know far more than we did even 20 years ago, and we are now much closer to answering questions about whether life exists elsewhere in the cosmos, how our planet came to be here, our cosmic origins and eventual fate.</p> <p>On a clear night the stars twinkle in the sky, and often we can see the bright planets of our own solar system in orbit, like us, around our sun. Until the early 1990s, we had no idea whether there were any other planets around the stars in the sky. Astronomers suspected so, but had no way to prove it. We have in the past decade found thousands in orbit around foreign stars, and have a better idea of how common they are. A sizable fraction of stars probably have their own planets, their own worlds carried around them in the most fantastically diverse solar systems.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"49807dbd6a144d2fe72f71ebf49936f6dc879656\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49807dbd6a144d2fe72f71ebf49936f6dc879656/245_432_1594_1593/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Pistol star, in an infrared image taken by the Hubble space telescope, is located near the centre of the Milky Way.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Pistol star, in an infrared image taken by the Hubble space telescope, is located near the centre of the Milky Way.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UCLA/Nasa/HO/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Look up at the stars, though, and you can\u2019t see any of their planets. They are tiny and don\u2019t make much light of their own. Even with powerful telescopes it is hard to see a planet directly, as the light from its parent star is blindingly bright in comparison. Instead, astronomers have devised ingenious methods to find them. One is the \u201cwobbling\u201d effect: a planet makes its parent star wobble just a little as it orbits around it, the star feeling a subtle pull of gravity from the smaller planet. In 1995 the Swiss astronomers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/1999/dec/16/starsgalaxiesandplanets\" title=\"\">Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz</a> used the Haute-Provence Observatory telescope in France to pinpoint a star, 51 Pegasi b, that was wobbling just as expected.

Kepler was designed to spot planets crossing in front of their parent stars, looking for the slight dimming effect of the planet blocking some of the starlight. Kepler has found thousands of planets this way, including many whose complete orbit around their star takes just hours or days. Some are so close to their star that their surface must be entirely molten lava. It has shown us solar systems with multiple planets, and some planets that orbit around two stars \u2013 \u201cTatooine\u201d planets, named after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/oct/17/the-last-jedi-luke-skywalker-goes-to-the-dark-side\" title=\"\">Luke Skywalker</a>\u2019s fictional home. Some planets are larger than Jupiter, some are as small as our moon. Most were found by professional astronomers, but amateurs have found them too, using pattern recognition to mine online data from the Kepler mission and catch planets that automated searches had missed. We now think there are more planets than stars in the sky.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Neutron stars are nature\u2019s weirdest. They are incredibly dense \u2013 a spoonful of neutron star weighs as much as a mountain</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We want to find out how likely it is that a habitable planet like Earth exists and, even better, to find one. In the elusive \u201cGoldilocks\u201d zone, the conditions must be just right: not too hot and not too cold. Astronomers have already found a few dozen planets like this, of which at least three are in the Trappist I solar system, found in 2015 around one of our nearest stars. Trappist I has seven planets, all similar in size to Earth, and at least one has a liquid water ocean. Studying these planets, and some of the hundreds of millions of potentially habitable planets in our Milky Way galaxy is the goal of ambitious new projects. Nasa\u2019s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (Tess), launched in 2018, is expected to find more than 20,000 new planets. The most interesting will be examined in greater detail by the James Webb Space telescope, the Hubble space telescope\u2019s successor, due to fly in the 2020s.</p> <p>The stars in the sky are hosts to this wealth of solar systems, but they also have a vital role to play as nature\u2019s great factories. Consider gold: where did it come from? Astronomers have long wondered how gold came to be part of Earth\u2019s ingredients. We know that it is stars themselves that manufacture what our own bodies are made of, including mostly carbon and oxygen. The British-American astronomer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2013/aug/23/cecilia-payne-gaposchkin-pants\" title=\"\">Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin</a> first worked out in the 1920s that stars are themselves mostly just hydrogen and helium gas. The intense heat at the heart of stars can fuse together these tiny atoms into slightly larger ones, which are then ejected into space when the stars explode at the end of their lives. Those recycled remnants will later be present at the birth of new stars like our sun, and will end up making new planets like our own. But the alchemy of making gold has long been a mystery. Gold has much larger atoms than carbon and oxygen, and can\u2019t be made in the core of a star. The explosions of individual stars could create some of it, but not enough.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"53cd1e7e5e31cc4617ca2cfba0caf0f642578946\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53cd1e7e5e31cc4617ca2cfba0caf0f642578946/0_0_2381_3508/679.jpg\" alt=\"Jocelyn Bell Burnell at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory at Cambridge University, in 1968.\" width=\"679\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jocelyn Bell Burnell at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory at Cambridge University, in 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Herald Archive/SSPL/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2017 astronomers concluded that another way gold is generated is during intense collisions of pairs of neutron stars. Neutron stars are nature\u2019s weirdest. They are incredibly dense, the result of squashing a star larger than our sun into a space just a few miles across, after it has run out of the fuel that kept it burning bright. A spoonful of neutron star weighs as much as a mountain. We can\u2019t see them with regular telescopes, but they send out radio waves. The stars spin around and, if oriented right, their beam of radio waves sweeps past Earth regularly, like a lighthouse beacon. The astronomer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/06/jocelyn-bell-burnell-british-astrophysicist-overlooked-by-nobels-3m-award-pulsars\" title=\"\">Jocelyn Bell Burnell</a> first discovered one of these stars in November 1967 using a radio telescope she built (with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/oct/03/fred-hoyle-nobel-prize\" title=\"\"> Anthony Hewish</a>) as a PhD student at the University of Cambridge. The pulses of radio waves she saw from the star were so regular, arriving every second, that they initially named it LGM-1 for \u201cLittle Green Men\u201d, half-jokingly considering that it might be a signal from aliens.</p> <p>When a pair of these neutron stars orbit around each other, their pull of gravity is so strong that they actually deform the fabric of space-time itself. A gravitational wave ripples outwards, subtly shrinking and then expanding space and everything in it, over and over, as it passes on by. On 17 August 2017 the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave observatory in the US (Ligo), and the Virgo detector in Italy felt a burst of these waves passing through Earth. Using lasers to measure the precise length of two 4km-long tubes positioned at right angles, they directly measured the tiny squeezing and stretching of the tubes. They were sensing two neutron stars for the first time, catching the last two minutes of their life as they spun thousands of times around each other before colliding.</p> <p>The Ligo and Virgo teams immediately alerted astronomers around the world, so that they could search for the aftermath. It was still daytime in Hawaii and Chile, home to many of the largest telescopes, so they had to wait until nightfall. Astronomer Ryan Foley and his team from the University of California in Santa Cruz were the first to locate a burst of intense light coming from the collision, using the Swope telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. They in turn alerted the community so that other telescopes could swing to take a closer look. In the end it was seen by 70 observatories on all seven continents and from space. What they had found was a kilonova and by studying the explosion, astronomers could tell that it had produced huge amounts of gold and platinum, much more than the entire weight of Earth. That particular collision happened too far away to have produced the gold on your finger, but here at last was decisive proof that closer to home collisions like this could have created Earth\u2019s gold.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/09/repeating-fast-radio-bursts-from-deep-space-could-be-aliens\">Mysterious fast radio bursts from deep space \u2018could be aliens\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The stars, source of heat and light and of our very bodies, give an impression of permanence. There they are, night after night. We do, though, already know that they will change. Their positions in the sky will gradually shift, as our own solar system moves around the Milky Way galaxy, our larger home to billions of stars. And they will eventually stop burning bright, and new ones will be born. Within astronomy, my particular expertise is cosmology, in which I ask questions about the life story of the whole of the universe. As a professor at Princeton University I also teach undergraduate students, and I train junior scientists to ask, and answer, their own questions about the cosmos.</p> <p>By the late 20th century astronomers had begun to consider a big change on the horizon. If we look beyond our own Milky Way galaxy, we find a sea of galaxies, each a collection of billions of stars, strewn throughout space. A century ago, the astronomers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2013/apr/23/should-change-name-higgs-boson\" title=\"\">Edwin Hubble and Georges Lema\u00eetre</a> showed that the galaxies are, on average, all moving apart from each other. Space itself is growing. But the pull of gravity of all the galaxies towards each other should tend to slow down the growth of space, just as a ball thrown in the air comes to a halt and then falls back down again. So astronomers turned to wondering whether space would one day stop growing altogether, and then start to shrink. Billions of years in the future, might all the galaxies come crashing back towards each other, invading our local cocoon of stars and marking the end of the universe as we know it?</p> <p>The key to answering this lay in measuring how fast space is growing and comparing it to its growth in the past. You can of course see into the past by looking far out into space, at places from which light set off a long time ago. Using a set of telescopes in Chile, Hawaii and the Canary Islands, rival teams of astronomers made new measurements of distant galaxies, using extremely bright exploding stars as cosmic markers. The teams, led by Brian Schmidt at Mount Stromlo observatory in Australia, and Saul Perlmutter at the University of California in Berkeley, measured galaxies whose light set off as long as 7bn years ago. In 1998 both announced the same surprising discovery, which was that space was not slowing down at all. Instead, galaxies appeared to be moving apart from each other faster and faster. This was as peculiar as if you threw a ball in the air, and it sped up and away from your hand into the sky. By the early 2000s other measurements of the universe were telling the same story, and over the past decade the evidence has become incontrovertible. We still don\u2019t yet know why this is happening. Astronomers refer to whatever is causing this as \u201cdark energy\u201d, a form of energy we have not yet identified. It could be the energy of empty space itself, or something entirely new. It is a mystery waiting to be solved.</p> <p>This new finding means that we no longer expect all the galaxies in space to come crashing back towards us. We are probably safe from that fate. But our own Milky Way is still on a collision course with at least one other galaxy. We are flying towards Andromeda, the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way, at a speed of more than 50 miles per second, and there is no turning back. A few billion years from now we will unavoidably collide and mix our stars together. Any living beings in our solar system by then will see a spectacular change in the night sky when it happens, but the gaps between stars is so large that it is unlikely any will physically collide. Our sun will simply find itself part of a larger home. </p> <p>This future view of our cosmos, our revolutionary discoveries of new worlds around stars, and our understanding of how the inner workings of stars make the fabric of our lives, are just some of this century\u2019s exciting discoveries. A common thread is that major advances in astronomy take teams of scientists working together, using telescopes around the world and in space, coupled with powerful computers. The questions we are asking cannot, for the most part, be solved by people working alone. As a result, the community is international. Meet an astronomer anywhere in the world, and most likely they are asking the same questions about the existence of life elsewhere, our place in space and the cosmic story of how we came to be here. And with many magnificent new telescopes being readied for the coming decade, we can expect together to take further great strides in our understanding of the night skies, and the wider universe, in the coming 20 years. We know, based on past experience, that the most exciting discoveries will probably be the ones we have been least expecting.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Jo Dunkley\u2019s <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/our-universe-628597.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Our Universe: An Astronomer\u2019s Guide</a> is published by Pelican on 31 January.</em></p>",

On 17 August 2017 the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave observatory in the US (Ligo), and the Virgo detector in Italy felt a burst of these waves passing through Earth. Using lasers to measure the precise length of two 4km-long tubes positioned at right angles, they directly measured the tiny squeezing and stretching of the tubes. They were sensing two neutron stars for the first time, catching the last two minutes of their life as they spun thousands of times around each other before colliding. The Ligo and Virgo teams immediately alerted astronomers around the world, so that they could search for the aftermath. It was still daytime in Hawaii and Chile, home to many of the largest telescopes, so they had to wait until nightfall. Astronomer Ryan Foley and his team from the University of California in Santa Cruz were the first to locate a burst of intense light coming from the collision, using the Swope telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. They in turn alerted the community so that other telescopes could swing to take a closer look. In the end it was seen by 70 observatories on all seven continents and from space. What they had found was a kilonova and by studying the explosion, astronomers could tell that it had produced huge amounts of gold and platinum, much more than the entire weight of Earth. That particular collision happened too far away to have produced the gold on your finger, but here at last was decisive proof that closer to home collisions like this could have created Earth\u2019s gold. The stars, source of heat and light and of our very bodies, give an impression of permanence. There they are, night after night. We do, though, already know that they will change. Their positions in the sky will gradually shift, as our own solar system moves around the Milky Way galaxy, our larger home to billions of stars. And they will eventually stop burning bright, and new ones will be born. Within astronomy, my particular expertise is cosmology, in which I ask questions about the life story of the whole of the universe. As a professor at Princeton University I also teach undergraduate students, and I train junior scientists to ask, and answer, their own questions about the cosmos. By the late 20th century astronomers had begun to consider a big change on the horizon. If we look beyond our own Milky Way galaxy, we find a sea of galaxies, each a collection of billions of stars, strewn throughout space. A century ago, the astronomers Edwin Hubble and Georges Lema\u00eetre showed that the galaxies are, on average, all moving apart from each other. Space itself is growing. But the pull of gravity of all the galaxies towards each other should tend to slow down the growth of space, just as a ball thrown in the air comes to a halt and then falls back down again. So astronomers turned to wondering whether space would one day stop growing altogether, and then start to shrink. Billions of years in the future, might all the galaxies come crashing back towards each other, invading our local cocoon of stars and marking the end of the universe as we know it? The key to answering this lay in measuring how fast space is growing and comparing it to its growth in the past. You can of course see into the past by looking far out into space, at places from which light set off a long time ago. Using a set of telescopes in Chile, Hawaii and the Canary Islands, rival teams of astronomers made new measurements of distant galaxies, using extremely bright exploding stars as cosmic markers. The teams, led by Brian Schmidt at Mount Stromlo observatory in Australia, and Saul Perlmutter at the University of California in Berkeley, measured galaxies whose light set off as long as 7bn years ago. In 1998 both announced the same surprising discovery, which was that space was not slowing down at all. Instead, galaxies appeared to be moving apart from each other faster and faster. This was as peculiar as if you threw a ball in the air, and it sped up and away from your hand into the sky. By the early 2000s other measurements of the universe were telling the same story, and over the past decade the evidence has become incontrovertible. We still don\u2019t yet know why this is happening. Astronomers refer to whatever is causing this as \u201cdark energy\u201d, a form of energy we have not yet identified. It could be the energy of empty space itself, or something entirely new. It is a mystery waiting to be solved. This new finding means that we no longer expect all the galaxies in space to come crashing back towards us. We are probably safe from that fate. But our own Milky Way is still on a collision course with at least one other galaxy. We are flying towards Andromeda, the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way, at a speed of more than 50 miles per second, and there is no turning back. A few billion years from now we will unavoidably collide and mix our stars together. Any living beings in our solar system by then will see a spectacular change in the night sky when it happens, but the gaps between stars is so large that it is unlikely any will physically collide. Our sun will simply find itself part of a larger home. This future view of our cosmos, our revolutionary discoveries of new worlds around stars, and our understanding of how the inner workings of stars make the fabric of our lives, are just some of this century\u2019s exciting discoveries. A common thread is that major advances in astronomy take teams of scientists working together, using telescopes around the world and in space, coupled with powerful computers. The questions we are asking cannot, for the most part, be solved by people working alone. As a result, the community is international. Meet an astronomer anywhere in the world, and most likely they are asking the same questions about the existence of life elsewhere, our place in space and the cosmic story of how we came to be here. And with many magnificent new telescopes being readied for the coming decade, we can expect together to take further great strides in our understanding of the night skies, and the wider universe, in the coming 20 years. We know, based on past experience, that the most exciting discoveries will probably be the ones we have been least expecting. \u2022 Jo Dunkley\u2019s Our Universe: An Astronomer\u2019s Guide is published by Pelican on 31 January.",

That creates a nuclear family economic unit that gives men the ability to focus nearly all of their efforts on their work for pay. Their wives worry about everything else.

Despite the shutdown directive, which has seen national park staff furloughed and the parks suffering from neglect, the interior department has continued processing oil drilling permits and applications. It has also moved forward with a controversial plan to increase drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A). According to a \u201ccontingency plan\u201d for an interior department agency, the Bureau of Land Management, approved last year, employees exempt from furloughs include those \u201cworking on selected energy, minerals and other associated permit activities for which the bureau charges a processing fee\u201d. As a result, workers in New Mexico and Wyoming have continued to process oil and gas drilling applications. In Alaska, the Trump administration is rolling out a contentious plan to overwrite Obama-era protections and expand the oil and gas leasing in two controversial areas, the wildlife refuge and the NPR-A. Since the shutdown began, the interior department moved forward with previously scheduled public meetings to educate stakeholders and provide opportunities for comment and discussion. Conversely, the same type of meetings scheduled by the department for an 800-megawatt wind farm project being built off the coast of Massachusetts, were canceled. Oversight officials have begun to investigate the agency. \u201cAsking people to comment on two major development processes in the Arctic with huge potential environmental and human consequences without anyone in the agency able to answer questions defeats the purpose of the public participation process,\u201d chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, Ra\u00fal M Grijalva wrote in a letter to the acting secretary of the interior, David Benhardt on 7 January.

Dhawan, Kohli and Rayudu all fell, and Rayudu used India\u2019s only review despite being plumb. That meant Dhoni couldn\u2019t use it when he shouldn\u2019t have been given out. He put on 137 with Rohit, and I can see that some Indian fans are already bagging him for batting too slowly, but if he\u2019d got out there would have been no chance. </p> <p>After that, Rohit couldn\u2019t get anyone to support him briskly enough late in the innings to keep the required rate in check. The dilemma of early wickets. But he went on to a quite brilliant hundred himself.</p> <p>He likes playing Australia. These are his last few ODI innings against the team in gold.<br></p> <p>141*, 11, 9*, 79, 209, 138, 34, 171*, 124, 6, 41, 99, 28, 7, 71, 65, 125, 133.</p> <p>But no win tonight. Australia will be delighted, after a win rate of 17%, I think it was, since the Champions Trophy in 2017.</p> <p>Richardson (4-26) and Behrendorff (2-39) were exceptional with the ball, and Lyon (0-50) exercised control in the face of withering attack.</p> <p>There were some decent numbers for Australia\u2019s batsmen: Khawaja 59, Marsh 54, Handscomb 73, Stoinis 47 not out. But they could have gone a fair bit bigger on a good batting surface, and will need to find a way to push that rate if they\u2019re to compete in the World Cup. The balance of the order especially doesn\u2019t look right. Will be interesting to see if they keep playing around through this series.</p> <p>We\u2019ll be back with you on Tuesday for the second match from Adelaide.

Bhuvi toe-ends a slower ball way up in the air but again it lands between a couple of pursuers. So once Shami gives the strike back, Bhuvi clears his front leg and slams the ball through cover for four!</p> <p>Perhaps a reminder to Kohli and team management that hey, I\u2019m a pretty useful cricketer in both disciplines.</p> <p>Two balls to go. Bhuvneshwar steps across and flips the shorter ball away over long leg. Handscomb runs around and can\u2019t quite hold it as he sprawls towards the drop zone. </p> <p>And with one ball to go, Shami walks at Stoinis, has a huge slog, sends it miles up past the cable camera, past the light towers, into low-lying cloud, and down into the hands of Maxwell who has run in from deep midwicket. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c39bd5ee4b072dc52e6d5ba\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-12T10:15:18.349Z\">10.15am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">WICKET!

Chance for a cheap wicket. Or a chance to be carved over point by Bhuvi for four. Which is what happens. Where was this guy while Rohit needed a buddy? Goes over cover for a couple more, as well as taking ones from the yorkers with ease. This is how Kuldeep gets strike from the last ball, and he pulls around to long leg in the air. This time, Khawaja has calmed his nerves.

Walks across to off stump and misses a scoop, then nails a hook shot past a diving square leg for one. <br></p> <p>I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready for this jelly: my body too Bhuvi-licious for you babe.</p> <p>Usman Khawaja certainly isn\u2019t ready.

Two of them from Stoinis, then he bowls very wide of off stump trying to land the wide yorker. Tries again and dishes up a sloppy full toss, which Rohit equally sloppily slaps over mid-off for four. This whole passage of play has been like throwing a pot of pasta sauce against the wall. Rohit knows he has to keep going, so he heaves again, and this time it won\u2019t fall safely.

I don\u2019t want to go on about it too much, but where was this when they were four down an hour ago? Stoinis has found his groove but has only just passed a strike rate of 100 in this final over. Another top edge just lands in front of point, the single giving Maxwell two balls to play with. <strong>SHOT! </strong>He gives it a flick of the wrist from a ball that would have missed off stump, directing it expertly over square leg for four.

They have been dreadful in this format of the game of late, winning just three of their last 21. Yes, Smith and Warner will help, but this problem started well before then.</p> <p>To help with their major issue - losing wickets in the middle overs - Peter Handscomb and Usman Khawaja have been invited back to the engine room, alongside Shaun Marsh: experience all the way.

Then the bowlers, of which they have Behrendorff on debut, Siddle playing his first ODI since the Carter Administration and Jhye Richardson just 22 years old. The experienced spinner is Lyon, back for another crack ahead of the World Cup, a man they want in England. </p> <p>I\u2019ll be back with you shortly to talk about the visitors, but for the time being, please do get in touch on the <a href=\"mailto:adam.collins.casual@theguardian.com\">email</a> or <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/collinsadam\">tweet</a>.

      "bodyText": "It got pretty close in the end thanks to that late work from Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who did what most other batsmen couldn\u2019t do and found runs at a decent clip. India shouldn\u2019t have got anywhere near it after losing three wickets with four runs on the board. Dhawan, Kohli and Rayudu all fell, and Rayudu used India\u2019s only review despite being plumb. That meant Dhoni couldn\u2019t use it when he shouldn\u2019t have been given out. He put on 137 with Rohit, and I can see that some Indian fans are already bagging him for batting too slowly, but if he\u2019d got out there would have been no chance. After that, Rohit couldn\u2019t get anyone to support him briskly enough late in the innings to keep the required rate in check. The dilemma of early wickets. But he went on to a quite brilliant hundred himself. He likes playing Australia. These are his last few ODI innings against the team in gold. 141*, 11, 9*, 79, 209, 138, 34, 171*, 124, 6, 41, 99, 28, 7, 71, 65, 125, 133. But no win tonight. Australia will be delighted, after a win rate of 17%, I think it was, since the Champions Trophy in 2017. Richardson (4-26) and Behrendorff (2-39) were exceptional with the ball, and Lyon (0-50) exercised control in the face of withering attack. There were some decent numbers for Australia\u2019s batsmen: Khawaja 59, Marsh 54, Handscomb 73, Stoinis 47 not out. But they could have gone a fair bit bigger on a good batting surface, and will need to find a way to push that rate if they\u2019re to compete in the World Cup. The balance of the order especially doesn\u2019t look right. Will be interesting to see if they keep playing around through this series. We\u2019ll be back with you on Tuesday for the second match from Adelaide. Until then, from Geoff and also Adam Collins, goodnight. 50th over: India 254-9 (Bhuvneshwar 29) The Stoin to finish things off. Bhuvi toe-ends a slower ball way up in the air but again it lands between a couple of pursuers. So once Shami gives the strike back, Bhuvi clears his front leg and slams the ball through cover for four! Perhaps a reminder to Kohli and team management that hey, I\u2019m a pretty useful cricketer in both disciplines. Two balls to go. Bhuvneshwar steps across and flips the shorter ball away over long leg. Handscomb runs around and can\u2019t quite hold it as he sprawls towards the drop zone. And with one ball to go, Shami walks at Stoinis, has a huge slog, sends it miles up past the cable camera, past the light towers, into low-lying cloud, and down into the hands of Maxwell who has run in from deep midwicket. 49th over: India 247-8 (Bhuvneshwar 23) Siddle is only bowling his 8th of the innings, and it\u2019ll be his last. Chance for a cheap wicket. Or a chance to be carved over point by Bhuvi for four. Which is what happens. Where was this guy while Rohit needed a buddy? Goes over cover for a couple more, as well as taking ones from the yorkers with ease. This is how Kuldeep gets strike from the last ball, and he pulls around to long leg in the air. This time, Khawaja has calmed his nerves. He can handle this. 48th over: India 238-7 (Bhuvneshwar 15, Kuldeep 2) Oh, Bhuvi came to party! Slaps Stoinis over mid-on for four, then opens the face and stylishly square-drives him behind point for more of the same. Walks across to off stump and misses a scoop, then nails a hook shot past a diving square leg for one. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready for this jelly: my body too Bhuvi-licious for you babe. Usman Khawaja certainly isn\u2019t ready. The last ball of the over is launched down the ground, Khawaja steadies under it at long-on... and lets it slip straight through his fingers. Were your hands shaking, Uz? 47th over: India 227-7 (Bhuvneshwar 5, Kuldeep 2) Now then. Can Jhye Richardson get a five-for? Bhuvi hits one in the air but safe. Kuldeep gets a couple of singles. Bhuvi digs out a couple of yorkers. Richardson finishes with 4-26 from his 10 overs. 46th over: India 223-7 (Bhuvneshwar 3, Kuldeep 0) If someone had gone with him, they could have done this in a waltz. Rohit Sharma is extraordinary at the top of the order. No wonder they keep wanting him to make it work in Test cricket. He\u2019s gone now, and the game is Australia\u2019s, with 66 runs needed in 24 balls and the bowlers holding the bat. Singles won\u2019t cut it from here. Two of them from Stoinis, then he bowls very wide of off stump trying to land the wide yorker. Tries again and dishes up a sloppy full toss, which Rohit equally sloppily slaps over mid-off for four. This whole passage of play has been like throwing a pot of pasta sauce against the wall. Rohit knows he has to keep going, so he heaves again, and this time it won\u2019t fall safely. Glenn Maxwell comes in from deep midwicket, and he\u2019s the best in the business when it comes to fielding. What a solo performance from Rohit Sharma. 45th over: India 214-6 (Rohit 128, Bhuvneshwar 0) Terrific over from Richardson. Mixes in a couple of slower balls, the bouncer, and makes sure Rohit can only get a single, then Bhuvneshwar Kumar can\u2019t get off strike. Takes four precious deliveries out of the equation. It looks too steep for India now, at 75 in 30 balls. Need a couple of 20-run overs. The WA Mafia gets the swordsman. Richardson bowls short to the left-hander. Jadeja has both feet off the ground as he plays the uppercut, but gets too much height on the shot. Marsh at deep backward has his heels near the rope again but knows where it is. Snared. 44th over: India 214-5 (Rohit 127, Jadeja 8) They just can\u2019t get a roll on. No batsman tonight bar Rohit has been able to work the strike with any ease. Jadeja gets blocked up again by Rohit, then runs a desperation single. With two balls left in the Stoinis over, something has to give. So Rohit range-hits a ball into the second deck of the Members Pavilion. Then follows up with a perfectly pulled four splitting the two boundary riders at midwicket. Crisp. 76 needed from 36. 43rd over: India 201-5 (Rohit 116, Jadeja 7) Rohit lines up Lyon and goes downtown once again. Can he possibly reel this in? It will take even more hitting. But that was a gorgeous straight hit, huge, never a moment of doubt that it would make the crowd. And Lyon comes back to tie up Jadeja once Rohit gives up the strike. 89 from 42 balls. Impossible once. Not any more. 42nd over: India 193-5 (Rohit 109, Jadeja 6) Rohit is feeling the pressure now: if you wanted to be harsh you could say a little of it is self-imposed. Jadeja works two and then one, before Rohit tries a big launch against Maxwell. Skews it, skies it, but it drops out at midwicket with everyone back on the fence. Then Maxwell bowls one that slips from his hand, a high full toss, and Rohit makes a mess of the swing but his top edge flies away through slip for four. That helps, but they still need 96 from 48. 41st over: India 184-5 (Rohit 103, Jadeja 3) I\u2019m not sure about the approach of still working singles with 10 overs to play. They take four runs from Lyon\u2019s over. Four! Singles! 40th over: India 180-5 (Rohit 101, Jadeja 1) He\u2019s certainly caught up after that enforced slow start. India remain in the game purely because of Rohit\u2019s innings. He has three centuries (and a 99) in his last six ODIs on Australian soil. Doesn\u2019t mind it here. Very muted celebration after flicking two runs off his pads, just a quick glove-punch and wave, though Jadeja hugs him and Rohit ignores it. Shades of a teenager with a parent there. But it\u2019s because Rohit want to finish the job, not worry about the plaudits now. Four runs and the wicket from the Richardson over, India need 109 from 60 balls. Bowled off the edge! Went for a big hook shot and didn\u2019t get it. Maybe for the best for India, because Karthik was struggling and they need someone who can feed Rohit the strike. Jadeja is next. 39th over: India 176-4 (Rohit 98, Karthik 12) Finally DK goes for one, a big bottom-handed whip across the line at Siddle that only fetches him one run to the square leg sweeper. Rohit resumes strike: he has to do the damage. Knows it. Tries. Big pull shot, hanging in the air. Mistimed, floating rather than soaring, but it finds the gap between deep square leg and long-on as they both run around. Four. Drives hard to mid-off next ball but can\u2019t beat Finch. Cover point and long leg are the other two boundary riders. Five in the circle. So Rohit goes again, pulling the off-cutter through midwicket for four. Then gets down on one knee, across to Siddle bowling fuller and wider, and scoops it for four more! Three in the over, and a century beckons. India need 113 from 66. 38th over: India 163-4 (Rohit 86, Karthik 11) Richardson returns. Short and fast, like a neat whisky. He\u2019s barely conceded a run today, having bowled at the start when the rebuild was on. But he carries that form on, zipping through Rohit with a ball that nearly bowls him, and going for two singles in the over. The asking rate creeps up. 126 in 72. 37th over: India 161-4 (Rohit 85, Karthik 10) Nearly through! The Dorff gets a big toe-end edge from Karthik, which squeezes through the gap, bounces in front of off stump, then bounces over. Karthik responds with an aerial flick that lands in front of the deep square leg fielder. Rohit bottom-edges a pull shot to fine leg for two, after charging to shorten the length. Smart play, didn\u2019t nail the shot. So he plays a classic straight drive instead for two more, walking at JB again. Behrendorff just got a finger on it, slowing it down, and nearly knocking it back onto the stumps behind him as well. Could have had a run out to his name had that worked out slightly differently. Rohit taps a single, then it\u2019s Karthik\u2019s turn to edge a pull past the keeper for two runs. All glove, not much love. Target: 128 from 78. 36th over: India 153-4 (Rohit 80, Karthik 7) Perhaps Rohit is just happy to give Karthik the time to get his eye in, knowing they can both hit the rope at a great rate later. Rohit takes a single by finding a gap, Karthik takes four balls to manage to match it. Stoinis has 0-28 from his six overs. 35th over: India 151-4 (Rohit 79, Karthik 6) So now things have gone quiet again. Not a whole lot of intent from these two to score in the last few overs. Behrendorff gets through a set for three singles, and has 2-31 from his nine. You\u2019d want to motor soon, needing 138 from 90. 34th over: India 148-4 (Rohit 77, Karthik 5) Marcus Stoinis, he of the shirtless net sessions, will not mind the dot balls. Rohit gives up a couple after Karthik gets off strike. When Karthik gets back, he edges fine to third man for a couple, willing the ball to go for four but not able to summon the psychic potency. India need 141 from 96. 33rd over: India 144-4 (Rohit 76, Karthik 2) Dinesh Karthik is off the mark immediately by gliding a single. Replays confirm that the previous ball was smashing middle stump, but pitched outside leg. Morally I don\u2019t mind some of those going the bowler\u2019s way: if you miss the shot, you\u2019re liable to get out. Harsha Bhogle sat down next to me a few minutes ago to announce that Jason Behrendorff looks like a young George H. W. Bush. I was taken aback by the suggestion, but once you think about it for a while it does start to grow on you. But then, so does ringworm. No reviews, but I\u2019m not sure that was out. The left-armer bowls full, Dhoni misses the flick and is hit low on the pad. I think that was just outside leg stump. But nothing can be done once the finger goes up. Breakthrough, but Dhoni has done a job to get India back in the hunt. Now it\u2019s over to DK. 32nd over: India 140-3 (Rohit 74, Dhoni 51) That strike rate for Dhoni looks horrible, but when you consider the situation when he walked to the crease it\u2019s understandable. He does need to make up a fair bit of that difference though. Gets to the milestone with a powerful on-drive from Stoinis, punches gloves briefly, waves the bat once, and gets back to work. Been there, done that. A couple more singles from the over. India need 149 from 108 balls. 31st over: India 134-3 (Rohit 73, Dhoni 46) Better from The Dorff. Dhoni finds the field three times, then flays at a ball and gets his edge beaten as Behrendorff pulls back the length. In the end there\u2019s just a single from the last ball. Top comeback. Here we go. Kruder &amp; Behrendorffmeister. Iconic. 30th over: India 133-3 (Rohit 73, Dhoni 45) \u201cDhoni, Dhoni, Dhoni!\u201d goes the chant around the SCG. Terrific atmosphere today, the joint is full. The crowd is jumping as Dhoni flicks Lyon square and once more races back for the second. The joint is heaving as Rohit lifts another six into the midwicket stands, this time down at the Members Pavilion. His fourth of the night, India\u2019s fifth. 156 needed from 120 balls. 29th over: India 124-3 (Rohit 67, Dhoni 42) Dorff, Dorff, Dorff. No, it\u2019s not a car with a large stereo system pulling up outside. It\u2019s Jason Behrendorff. Bowling a wide. Being scooped by Rohit over the batsman\u2019s own head for four. Being lofted over mid-off, shot of the day from Rohit, clean and clear for four. A dozen from the over. The partnership at 120. The target at 165 from 21 overs, 126 balls. Could they? 28th over: India 112-3 (Rohit 58, Dhoni 41) Lyon down on one knee pleading for the wicket of Dhoni, but only surrendering yet another leg bye. Rohit edging wide of the keeper for two. Four from the over. 27th over: India 108-3 (Rohit 55, Dhoni 41) Whatever you think of his batting, Dhoni\u2019s running is still top notch. Shuffles at Richardson to open up some space at point, slices the ball there deliberately, and makes it back for two as deep backward runs around. Had to be fast. Was. A subsequent single to a similar area raises the 100 partnership. Richardson hits the pad and gives the most half-hearted appeal. Quarter-hearted. Sliding down leg. As is his next ball, even more so, conceding a wide. Then off the pad for a leg bye. Wanting to give the extras column a workout. Seven from the over. 26th over: India 101-3 (Rohit 53, Dhoni 38) Lyon is parsimony personified. Despite the six-hitting, he\u2019s still bowled six overs for 26 runs. They only get two singles from him, and one of those leaves Dhoni flat on his face in the dirt having to dive in at the non-striker\u2019s end. The hundred comes up for India. 25th over: India 99-3 (Rohit 52, Dhoni 37) Richardson returns. Dhoni isn\u2019t bothered by the pace, happy to dab it away. Four runs, all in ones. The run rate is nudging 4 now, and the required rate is steady enough at 7.6. That means 190 runs are needed from 25 overs, or 150 balls. 24th over: India 95-3 (Rohit 50, Dhoni 36) Snappers ahoy: Glenn Maxwell\u2019s into the attack. Didn\u2019t get a bowl when Steve Smith was captain but he does under Aaron Finch. Dhoni comes awkwardly across his front pad to a couple, then drops to a knee and whacks a sweep shot that\u2019s nearly caught at square leg. Inches from the fingertips of Richardson diving to his left, then hits the boundary. Dhoni gets a single, then Rohit slashes wide outside off and edges over backward point for four. 23rd over: India 79-3 (Rohit 46, Dhoni 31) There\u2019s another four, a veritable glut of them. Rohit through cover this time. Plus three singles from Siddle, and the partnership is worth 82. 22nd over: India 79-3 (Rohit 41, Dhoni 29) Stoinis bowls short, Dhoni pulls, and it\u2019s nearly snared at midwicket. Siddle dived away to his left but the ball went just over him. Looks like he got a touch, because it slowed up and only went for two runs. A single, a single. A wide. A single. The collection continues. 21st over: India 73-3 (Rohit 25, Dhoni 40) We waited, and it came. First ball of the over. Siddle bowls outside off, not too short, but Dhoni was able to get low and play a cut shot anyway, finding the gap behind point for four! A rare and exotic four. Then celebrates with a very nice leave of the next ball. Punches a single into the covers. This is classic MSD stuff. Just take it deep, as has always been his motto. Karthik and Jadeja to come can hit, but you don\u2019t want to leave them too much to do. 20th over: India 68-3 (Rohit 20, Dhoni 40) Stoinis uses the same line of attack, but the batsmen milk it a bit more successfully this time. Five singles and a brace, Dhoni still sharp between the wickets. 19th over: India 62-3 (Rohit 38, Dhoni 16) Nice little dab from Rohit earns him three from Lyon, running the ball fine. Dhoni tries to smack one into the midwicket gap, but drags it flat and squarer and it bounces in front of the sweeper in front of square. 18th over: India 57-3 (Rohit 34, Dhoni 15) Marcus Stoinis will have a bowl. He\u2019s the one India have to target, but he\u2019s also a skilled operator bowling at the death in T20 cricket. Variations, accuracy. Sometimes bowling a bit slower than others can help in this format. He\u2019s bowling into the body, looking to prevent swinging room, and it works with four singles shovelled into the leg side. A stat from the telly says that no Indian team has got this deep into an ODI innings without hitting a four. Ever. Which would be great news for Australia if not for the ones clearing the rope. 17th over: India 53-3 (Rohit 32, Dhoni 13) It\u2019s worth a mention that India have scored three sixes and no fours so far in this innings. They\u2019re going at 2.88 per over needing 7.22. Australia\u2019s 288 is looking pretty good (though that doesn\u2019t change the fact that batting in that fashion will get Australia rinsed at the upcoming World Cup). Make that four sixes. Having blocked out the first five balls of the over, Rohit keeps them guessing by shimmying a pace down the wicket and setting off a shuttle launch. It soars high, high into the blue Sydney sky, a real steepler that would have cleared any church in the world. It drops into the crowd at midwicket in front of the O\u2019Reilly Stand. 16th over: India 47-3 (Rohit 26, Dhoni 13) They ease off again versus Siddle, happy to glide three singles and avoid attack. What a fate, Megan. What a fate. The one thing you can say for sure is that Peter Siddle would still come out of Jumanji cheerful. 15th over: India 44-3 (Rohit 24, Dhoni 12) Rohit with another smear for two and then a single from Lyon. The 37-year-old Dhoni comes on strike. Does he still have it? Yes, at least against this ball, he does. Cannons the shot over wide long on for six, dropping to a rapturous crowd clad in Indian blue. The noise coming up to us on the level above is clamorous. 14th over: India 35-3 (Rohit 21, Dhoni 6) The Hitman decides it\u2019s time to go. Comes down the wicket to try lofting Siddle, but only slices him high over backward point. Lands safely for two runs. Nothing risky about the next shot though, hooking the bouncer for six! Got every bit of that one. Then a single to keep the strike. Nine from the over. The required rate is just past seven. 13th over: India 26-3 (Rohit 12, Dhoni 6) Nathan Lyon is bowling beautifully, denying Dhoni any space to swing. Dhoni comes down the wicket three times, four times, but can only get the ball back to the bowler from each. It\u2019s a maiden! The fifth in 13 overs. The ground DJ is trying to get things moving with this number. The ground DK is Dinesh Karthik, who just has his initials on the back of his shirt. Baller move. 12th over: India 26-3 (Rohit 12, Dhoni 6) Peter Siddle has got his lime-green collar popped, a gold sweatband on his left wrist... incredible areas. Goes up for a huge retro appeal as he hits Dhoni on the pad. Going down leg. Australia have no review left, luckily, or they might have blown it on that. Dhoni drives a single, and that\u2019s the only score from the over. I joked about going scoreless before, but Rohit is 12 from 33 and Dhoni 6 from 29. 11th over: India 25-3 (Rohit 12, Dhoni 5) Here\u2019s another retro pick in Nathan Lyon. Australia tried to stack the ODI team with T20 players last November, and when that didn\u2019t work they\u2019ve stacked it with Test players instead. Khawaja, Marsh, Handscomb through that middle. Four runs from Lyon\u2019s over. 10th over: India 21-3 (Rohit 10, Dhoni 3) Here we go, here we go. Peter Siddle, for his first delivery in ODI cricket since 2010. Last time he played he was bowling with Mitch Johnson, Nathan Hauritz and Clint McKay. He got rained off partway through an over. Now he can finish it. It\u2019s a beauty, too, beating Dhoni\u2019s edge a couple of times and costing just one run plus a leg bye. 9th over: India 19-3 (Rohit 9, Dhoni 3) They are really taking it easy, this Indian pair. Trying to survive for now. Behrendorff goes for just two. 8th over: India 17-3 (Rohit 8, Dhoni 2) Richardson bowling, three singles from the over as the calm-down period continues. 7th over: India 14-3 (Rohit 6, Dhoni 1) Behrendorff to Dhoni, pitching up and testing him. MS can\u2019t put him away, and it\u2019s another maiden. \u201cTargeting the stumps of the new batsman,\u201d emails Daniel Guidone. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the test quicks do this? 6th over: India 14-3 (Rohit 6, Dhoni 1) Richardson loses his rhythm and bowls a couple of wides. He\u2019s a short man, relative to other fast bowlers, and runs in with pumping angular elbows. Delivers with a flurry, and fast. Dhoni can\u2019t get a run, defending several then mistiming a pull, until the last ball of the over. Inside edge, thigh pad, runs away behind square, and it\u2019s a low-key way to score his 10,000th ODI run for India (having also scored 174 playing three official ODIs for an Asia XI). 5th over: India 11-3 (Rohit 6, Dhoni 0) To continue the catalogue of eventfulness, Behrendorff bowls a no-ball. Oversteps, and the free hit is signalled. Like stealing from Smaug, Rohit is awakened from his slumber and descends to pillage the folk of Dale. Or Jason, in this case. Flicks off the pads to deep backward square. It\u2019s almost six, it\u2019s hanging. Shaun Marsh knows he can\u2019t dismiss the batsman so he doesn\u2019t bother trying to catch it, he just volleyballs it back into play. But his heel has kissed the boundary padding, so it\u2019s six nonetheless. 4th over: India 4-3 (Rohit 0, Dhoni 0) Richardson with the double-wicket maiden. And now we\u2019ve got two of the keenest early blockers in the world at the crease. We might go scoreless until the 30th over here. Then chase the target anyway. Below is the fate that Australia just avoided. If you\u2019re confused by that scoreline, it\u2019s 3 wickets for 4 runs. Rayudu doesn\u2019t last either, hit on the front pad by a ball that cut in a bit. He reviewed it, and it was smashing leg stump. So the review is gone along with three batsmen. And MS Dhoni comes to the crease in the fourth over. Scenes. They don\u2019t come any bigger than that! Richardson gets the wicket. He didn\u2019t exactly do Kohli for pace, as that flick off the pads came right out of the middle. But maybe the pace made Kohli mistime fractionally so that it went in the air at catchable height to square leg. Stoinis snaffled it. 3rd over: India 4-1 (Rohit 0, Kohli 3) The Dorff to continue. It\u2019s easier to type. Something about the sequence of letters confuses the fingertips. Kohli is away with a couple through cover, then runs a single behind point. 2nd over: India 1-1 (Rohit 0, Kohli 0) Massive cheers of course as Virat Kohli comes to the crease. The best ODI run-chaser the game has ever known. This target is merely mid-range for him. Will he carry on his stellar 2018? Won\u2019t get the chance to face a ball, as Jhye Richardson is bowling to Rohit who remains in Test match mode. That was a good fast over too. Looked brisk even from the press box. This just in from a CA spokesperson. \u201cSteve Smith will undergo surgery on Tuesday to repair a ligament in his right elbow. He is expected to wear a brace for six weeks before commencing rehabilitation. Return to play time frames will be clearer once the brace has been removed.\u201d 1st over: India 1-1 (Rohit 0) Righto, away we go. With the ball in hand it\u2019s the new Big German Disco, inheriting the title from Ben Hilfenhaus. The heir to the title is Jason Behrendorff. He bowls a few dotties, coming left-arm over the wicket to the right-handed Rohit. But fifth ball of the innings strikes Rohit on the pad. They go up for a review, Australia. It\u2019s one of the worst reviews of all time. It\u2019s pitching outside leg, hitting the batsman outside leg, and going over the stumps. Aside from that he was stone. But the very next ball, as they scamper a leg bye, Behrendorff hits Dhawan dead in front and the finger goes up. End of the over. Eventful. Great shot. (Photographically.) This is on the speakers at the SCG. Temper Trap. A real feel-good tune. Carelesssss whissperrrrrs... Hello friends. Thanks Adam. He\u2019s right, you know: it looks a pretty decent score, but then the ease with which shots were played on this wicket, and the way the innings unfolded, 280 could have been more like 330. Not sure why you\u2019d take your player with the best strike rate in the team, and I think the best in the world for players averaging over 30, and stick him way down the order to come in with 16 balls to go. While playing three anchor-role batsmen through the middle order. Strange strange days down south. And that\u2019s me done. Some thoroughly uninspiring batting salvaged somewhat by that final flourish. I\u2019ll leave it with Geoff to track India\u2019s pursuit of 289. Bye! 50th over: Australia 288-5 (Stoinis 47, Maxwell 11) BIG from Stoinis, climbing into a full toss from Bhuvi, putting him into the midwicket seats. He swings again, the top edge clearing the fielding circle and running down to third man for four! I don\u2019t want to go on about it too much, but where was this when they were four down an hour ago? Stoinis has found his groove but has only just passed a strike rate of 100 in this final over. Another top edge just lands in front of point, the single giving Maxwell two balls to play with. SHOT! He gives it a flick of the wrist from a ball that would have missed off stump, directing it expertly over square leg for four. On his hands and knees, he digs out the wide yorker to finish, Stoinis scampering back fortwo. That\u2019s it, Stoinis unbeaten on 47 (43) Maxwell 11 (5). 49th over: Australia 270-5 (Stoinis 36, Maxwell 5) Stoinis into the 30s with a whack over midwicket that just makes it to the rope after pitching and losing speed. With Maxwell his partner, there is no doubt they are taking two from the next clip to square leg - that\u2019s intent! An excellent shorter ball from Shami, cutting back off the seam, denies a run from the fourth ball but a single down the ground. Maxwell one chance, giving it his best to clear cover with a committed upper cut, but deep point keeps it to two. 48th over: Australia 259-5 (Stoinis 27, Maxwell 3) Maxwell deflects his first ball to third man for what becomes two after a misfield, then taking one to mid-off. Can Stoinis complete the Bhuvi over with a boundary? Nup, it\u2019s one to point. Handscomb finds Dhawan at deep point, the catch safely pouched. He should have fell the ball before, Rayudu charging in so hard in from the rope that he not only dropped the catch but parried it over the crossbar, into the crowd. 47th over: Australia 248-4 (Handscomb 67, Stoinis 25) Shami is doing his bit to help the home side set enough runs that Kohli can reach three figures in the chase, spraying one wide down the legside then another over Handscomb\u2019s head. Stoinis tried to split open midwicket earlier on but didn\u2019t get enough on it, nor did Handscomb towards extra cover. The more senior man tries to swing into the O\u2019Reilly Stand to finish but the top edge lands inside the fielding circle. Good news from Warwick Baker, our evacuated correspondent from the Churchill Stand: he\u2019s been upgraded to a corporate box! Drinks on him! 46th over: Australia 240-4 (Handscomb 63, Stoinis 23) Shot! He can do it, Handscomb, there is no doubting this, which only makes the last half an hour the more frustrating. Facing his first ball of the new Bhuvi over, the Victorian captain comes down the track to meet the ball, slaying it over extra cover for four. Stoinis\u2019 turn and he tries to ping out to midwicket but doesn\u2019t make full contact. The 50 stand is raised with the shot, in 50 balls. Handscomb again gets the ticking over to finish, picking up a full toss slower ball over square leg into the gap. 11 off it! 45th over: Australia 229-4 (Handscomb 54, Stoinis 21) Jadeja on, back to Plan A! After so successfully taking the attack to Kuldeep, the seven runs collected here are all to the sweepers, all without attacking the boundary through the air. The spin twins have finished their work and they have been fantastic, Kuldeep taking 2/54 and Jadeja 1/48. 44th over: Australia 222-4 (Handscomb 51, Stoinis 17) A SIX! The first of the innings! THEN ANOTHER! The first of these, via Stoinis, ends up the second deck of the Members Stand, picking Kuldeep up off a length. Inspired by it, perhaps, Handscomb does the same from the final ball for the same result. HOW ABOUT THAT? Having a pop with wickets in hand might be worthwhile! \u201cAustralian selectors surely operating some sort of Antipodean double-dealing sporting version of a John Le Carr\u00e9 novel,\u201d emails Brian Withington. \u201c\u2018The Guy who Stayed in the Cold\u2019 or maybe \u2018Tinker, Tailor, Maxwell, Bye\u2019. All designed to confuse English and lull them into a false sense of security before World Cup and Ashes. Inscrutably deep stuff.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. All about that false sense of security, they are. 43rd over: Australia 208-4 (Handscomb 45, Stoinis 10) Jadeja\u2019s turn to squeeze, six runs taken all in the small currency, no risks at all. I can\u2019t believe how bad this is. 42nd over: Australia 202-4 (Handscomb 41, Stoinis 8) This is extraordinary batting. They\u2019ve picked up three from the Kuldeep over, all singles, without even looking to hit - or clear - the boundary. Have these blokes not watched any ODI cricket in the last three years? You\u2019d think they were new to the format. No other team does this. 41st over: Australia 199-4 (Handscomb 40, Stoinis 6) Handscomb finds the sweeper along the ground, good stuff. Stoinis takes three balls to beat the ring for one. Going well. Four from the first ~explosion~ over. Yes, well bowled Shami. Still. Fair dinkum. 40th over: Australia 195-4 (Handscomb 38, Stoinis 4) Kuldeep\u2019s eighth over and it adds to the strangle. Four singles were found but all with maximum safety. Handscomb missed out on a long hop too, hitting it straight to point. We\u2019re finally into happy hour with 1/57 added between overs 30 to 40. At least they have made it to over 40 with wickets in hand; that was the point, I think. \u201cIf they go at ten an over from here they\u2019ll go close to 300!\u201d jokes Geoff Lemon. \u201cThat\u2019s a monster score, nobody chases that.\u201d Ben Jones adds: India will win this nine wickets in hand with 74 balls remaining. 39th over: Australia 191-4 (Handscomb 36, Stoinis 2) Shami just sent down the 39th over an ODI at the Australian number five and number six that went for just two singles. Forget defending the World Cup, they will be hard pressed beating a much-improved Afghanistan in their tournament opener. Especially if the track is spinning. 38th over: Australia 189-4 (Handscomb 35, Stoinis 1) Singles along the carpet for the three remaining Kuldeep balls to complete his successful over, Stoinis off the mark. \u201cRetro jersey, retro scoring rate,\u201d says Kiran Kumar. I\u2019d show you the dismissal but the clips aren\u2019t often posted on twitter from those that can when Australia are doing poorly. Kuldeep is brought back and has a wicket from his third ball! Marsh, to his credit, tried to take him on but didn\u2019t make quite enough contact, holing out to long-on. His 70-ball innings comes to an end, bringing Maxw..., I mean, Stoinis to the middle. 37th over: Australia 185-3 (Marsh 54, Handscomb 32) Up comes the 50-partnership with the second of four singles in the Bhuvi over, the aggression shown from his previous set shelved for now. It was nice while it lasted, I guess. \u201cFrom The Big Show to The Big No Show,\u201d emails Ian Forth. \u201cThough somehow I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be the title of Maxwell\u2019s autobiography. I\u2019m a little ignorant here, what is he supposed to have actually done to upset the Powers That Be? Score runs too fast?\u201d They are adamant that it is nothing to do with his personality. Perhaps the best tell was when Smith said last year that Maxwell was dropped for not training smart enough? I wrote a lot of words about him this week; this recapping the misinformation mess. 36th over: Australia 181-3 (Marsh 53, Handscomb 30) Marsh locks up his World Cup spot (for 2023, hiyooooo!), raising his 13th ODI half-century with a stand-and-deliver smash through midwicket. Handscomb completes the over with just about the shot of the day so far, driving through cover between two fielders for another four. That\u2019s Khaleel\u2019s eighth over and surely the final one he\u2019ll deliver here, his analysis 8-0-55-0. 35th over: Australia 171-3 (Marsh 48, Handscomb 25) Consecutive fours! Strike lambs! Handscomb is the man, steering Bhuvi past point then creaming him to wide long-on. The Victorian is up to a run a ball, Marsh 48 from 64 at the other end. \u201cPeople have been evacuated from the bays at the SCG due to a structural problem with the roof,\u201d reports Warwick Baker. \u201cThere are many irate fans. Because they have been redirected to standing areas in the Bradman Stand.\u201d So they have. I can see three bays in the Churchill Stand now empty. I know the SCG Trust are keen to rebuild that stand, this might help bolster their case chasing that sweet government cash. Yep, CA have confirmed that it is a roof panel that is being looked at, so the experts are coming in to review with fans relocated for now. 34th over: Australia 160-3 (Marsh 47, Handscomb 15) Khaleel again, the one bowler that the Australians are happy to at least try and attack. And Marsh goes at him! Hurrah! It comes off an edge but over the cordon and far away for four. After the customary singles, it is an over of nine. Party on! Drinks. 33rd over: Australia 151-3 (Marsh 42, Handscomb 11) Bhuvi is on and nearly gets a return catch gifted first ball from Handscomb, just outside his reach. This won\u2019t surprise you: five of his six balls here are dots. Good stuff boys, let\u2019s see him off. Imagine how hard Eoin Morgan must be laughing if he\u2019s watching this somewhere. 32nd over: Australia 150-3 (Marsh 42, Handscomb 10) Lovely defensive posture from Handscomb, really getting in behind Shami. We\u2019re joking around in the press box: we know Australia want to play more like England at the moment but not the 2015 model. Shami misses his bumper, a wide called, with four singles to the sweepers. \u201cDespite that Rayudu over and the all pace attack selection blunder,\u201d emails Abhijato Sensarma, \u201cVirat\u2019s captaincy choices have been spot-on, exemplified by near perfect execution. For a long time, I thought he was too one-dimensional - this tour has gone a long way in changing that general perception.\u201d With you here. I spent some time discussing this point on Geoff and my podcast after the Test. Specifically, how my own impression of Kohli has evolved quite a bit. 31st over: Australia 145-3 (Marsh 40, Handscomb 8) Jadeja nearly pulls off another three-single over but Handscomb jumps on a marginally shorter ball to finish, placing it nicely through cover for four. More please, immediately, or let Maxwell at it. \u201cIt is hard to see where Glenn Maxwell sits in the modern Australian team,\u201d laments Jim Maxwell on ABC. \u201cNow he\u2019s not even deemed worthy of a top six spot in the one-day team.\u201d 30th over: Australia 138-3 (Marsh 38, Handscomb 3) Righto, so double 30 as they say - 276. Imagine England or India setting up an innings like this? They don\u2019t, not in this era. Shami sent four dot balls to Handscomb to begin. Sure, he is new to the crease but the field is out and his job is to accumulate singles from the get-go. Two from it. 29th over: Australia 136-3 (Marsh 37, Handscomb 2) Handscomb does walk out where he was listed at number five, off the mark with a single to long-off first ball, Marsh getting one to midwicket before Handscomb again plays down the ground. \u201cThe poor run rate,\u201d says Patrick Hargreaves \u201cIndia arent bowling hand grenades. Is it a mindset or a form thing? No six hit yet or attempted. Looks like everyones batting for their place not the win.\u201d They have bowled well but I\u2019m sure confidence is a big part of it. It takes a long time for a white-ball team to gel, and this is a fairly big overhaul. It\u2019s not a great time to be trying that on with six months to the World Cup but they don\u2019t have much choice. Sweeping conventionally, Khawaja missed the ball, crashing into his front pad below the knee. He sent it upstairs but DRS showed it to be clipping middle and leg. The partnership of 92 for the third wicket comes to an end. 28th over: Australia 132-2 (Khawaja 59, Marsh 35) Khaleel has been the least effective of India\u2019s seamers today, back now for his sixth over. Two wides in this set won\u2019t help his confidence, every legal delivery scored off too. Good thing that Kohli got a couple out of Rayudu so that the left-armer will only be required to send down eight. \u201cThe longer you go with Maxwell sitting in the sheds is a waste of talent,\u201d says Gilchrist, suggesting that he should be promoted at the fall of the next wicket. I\u2019ll believe it when I see it. 27th over: Australia 123-2 (Khawaja 55, Marsh 32) Another four for Khawaja with the reverse sweep, a shot that is quickly becoming one of his most dependable. He can\u2019t back it up, though, Jadeja finishing his over with four dots on the bounce. Can\u2019t be having that in the 27th over of an ODI. 26th over: Australia 119-2 (Khawaja 51, Marsh 32) Into the second half of the Australian innings with Shami back into the track for Rayudu. \u201cYou normally would double the score at 30 overs,\u201d says Warne, right on cue. \u201cBut you can probably make that 32 overs now with the players so powerful.\u201d Khawaja takes one to square leg, bringing up his half-century in his first innings back in the canary yellow. Two singles to finish, Marsh to cover and Khawaja long on. That makes three from it, of course. 25th over: Australia 116-2 (Khawaja 49, Marsh 31) The batsmen exchange singles to long-on but that\u2019s their lot, Jadeja getting through the set in no more than 60 seconds. 24th over: Australia 114-2 (Khawaja 48, Marsh 30) They go after Rayudu! Khawaja tickles the first ball of the over fine for four then stands back to slap an \u201cabsolute pie\u201d (as described by Shane Warne on the telly) to the square leg rope for four more. Ten off the over from India\u2019s sixth bowler. That might be it for him. \u201cYou can feel the momentum building now,\u201d says Gilchrist. That might be a fraction optimistic. 23rd over: Australia 104-2 (Khawaja 39, Marsh 29) There is that reverse, Khawaja getting into position early and clearing square leg to get himself another boundary. Lovely cricket. It has taken a while, but I reckom he might have just found his groove. 22nd over: Australia 98-2 (Khawaja 34, Marsh 28) Rayudu, the sixth bowler, is on with his offies. Not a bad shout from Kohli to squeeze out a couple of overs from him now while Australia are battling to shift gears. Marsh gets two from the first ball but only one other single. Guess what? Three from it. 21st over: Australia 95-2 (Khawaja 34, Marsh 25) Three dots to begin for Jadeja to Khawaja, one of those prompting a visit to the third ump after Dhoni got the bails off. Khawaja paddles a couple to finish, having reversed for the first time a few overs back. 20th over: Australia 91-2 (Khawaja 31, Marsh 24) Marsh puts away a long-hop from Kuldeep, cutting hard behind point, the ball beating the sweeper to the rope. Four other singles along the way makes this the most productive over in some long time. \u201cIt\u2019s really great that the ICC have allowed them to play the fifth day of the Test even though it was rained out,\u201d says Pat Noone, another member of the CricProf Massive. 19th over: Australia 83-2 (Khawaja 29, Marsh 18) Five singles this time, in a row! As a bloke once said several thousand times to the Australian people: what a time to be alive. 18th over: Australia 78-2 (Khawaja 27, Marsh 15) We\u2019re back with Kuldeep from the Paddington end, now into his fifth over. I wonder whether Kohli will bowl out his ten straight, per what England did with Moeen a lot last year? He slips through this set giving up only three singles. Half the overs today must have gone for three singles. Yuk. \u201cOther instances aside,\u201d begins Vasu Chaurey, \u201cit\u2019s really nice to listen to Warne commentate while Kuldeep is bowling. Low-key wholesome. I agree with him too (\u201cIt\u2019s really nice to see a leggie bowling in the mid 70s. He\u2019s able to do that because he can beat the batsmen in flight.\u201d), it\u2019s a delight.\u201d Yep, I\u2019m not much for Warne on the 1s and 2s as a rule, but I agree, he\u2019s great when a wrist-spinner is in the attack and doing it well. \u201cP.S. You\u2019re about the only other person I know who has Kuldeep and Bhuvi in his special favourites list. Cheers!\u201d I\u2019m always recruiting - especially for Kuldeep. 17th over: Australia 75-2 (Khawaja 26, Marsh 13) A huuuuge roar goes up around the SCG when Jadeja as announced. There are a lot more people in today than on the opening day of the Test, the vast majority wearing blue. I can\u2019t wait to get down there with them during the run chase later when Kohli is better, they\u2019re the best fans in the world when their team is on top. Back to the middle, Jadeja darts in his six deliveries for just the three singles, in keeping with the dreary theme of the innings so far. Drinks! 16th over: Australia 72-2 (Khawaja 25, Marsh 11) Khawaja picks the Kuldeep wrong\u2019un this time, pulling hard into the gap for four. He\u2019s 25 from 42, which isn\u2019t pretty, but he absolutely cannot throw it away now. He has to be there in an hour, at a run a ball from this point forward. Capiche? 15th over: Australia 66-2 (Khawaja 20, Marsh 10) Four for Australia, albeit via Dhoni who doesn\u2019t cleanly take a Shami delivery that bounced on the way through to him. Three other singles to the sweepers. Khawaja, at last, into the 20s. \u201cReplays showed Hawk Eye declaring the ball to be pitching outside leg (the Shami appeal),\u201d notes Vasu Chaurey. Fair enough. \u201cAlso, 12.2 and 12.3 were absolutely brilliant to watch (Shami to Marsh).\u201d What a fantastic bowler he has evolved into. 14th over: Australia 59-2 (Khawaja 18, Marsh 9) Khawaja nearly carves Kuldeep back onto his stumps, cutting the wrong\u2019un close to his body; the shot that did Carey in. It\u2019s the third dot ball on the bounce, followed by three singles. I know it\u2019s early, but Australia are already in a world of pain. 13th over: Australia 56-2 (Khawaja 16, Marsh 8) DJ Shami to Shaun Marsh, a match up he will fancy for all the obvious reasons. In keeping with that expectation, he finds his inside edge to begin, then beats his outside edge, then does it again. Sigh. Oh, that\u2019s better, Marsh clipping off the pads for four to give him a bit of relief. Meanwhile, Glenn Maxwell is batting at seven today. 12th over: Australia 52-2 (Khawaja 16, Marsh 4) Much better batting, the Australian pair finding the sweepers from five or six Kuldeep deliveries to get them heading in the right direction through this all-important accumulation period. 11th over: Australia 46-2 (Khawaja 14, Marsh 0) Ohhhh, how is that not given out? Shami its Khawaja on the pad with a slower ball and is insistent! It\u2019s not given. Dhoni gives the bowler the option to review but he says no. Oh dear, the replay shows Khawaja back on his stumps dead in front. Oh well. The No3 responds next ball, as is the custom, with a drive through the covers for four. Shot. Bad news for people who like special things: James Pattinson is injured again. It\u2019s the wrong\u2019un again from Kuldeep! Into the attack and striking inside an over! Carey went back in his crease playing for turn away from his blade, setting up to cut. When the ball came back his way, he didn\u2019t quite adjust the stroke well enough, edging into the hands of Rohit at slip. Great captaincy getting on his gun spinner inside the power play. 10th over: Australia 41-2 (Khawaja 9, Marsh 0) A power play worth 41. \u201cIt\u2019s cute that you are trying to win the 2015 World Cup,\u201d sledges Ben Jones, CricViz young gun, to my left. He\u2019s enjoying this a lot more than the home fans are. Welcome to the middle overs. 9th over: Australia 37-1 (Carey 20, Khawaja 9) Shami gets his first twist of the day, running towards us from the Randwick End. To Khawaja. Another fine over from India, as poor as it was from Khawaja to only score from the final ball, the new man locating his inside edge early on then beating the outside of the blade with a ripper. Early signs from the Cricket Ground DJ are strong, this his latest mid-over offering. As I\u2019ve said time and again, that\u2019s my true dream job. And I\u2019m daring to dream. Oh! And now this after this Shami over and I\u2019m officially overheating in the press box. 8th over: Australia 35-1 (Carey 20, Khawaja 7) Shot! Carey flicks up the back leg on contact with his flick through midwicket, as if he\u2019s the batsman down the other end. Unfortunately, it is one of only two balls scored off from Khaleel\u2019s over. They may be in the 1986 kits but The Wombats had it right when talking about Australia\u2019s first ten overs here - they\u2019re bringing back 1996 with their current run rate of 4.38. 7th over: Australia 30-1 (Carey 16, Khawaja 6) Khawaja drives twice to fielders in the circle to start the Bhuvi over, getting off strike to midwicket. Carey takes a couple off his hip but that\u2019s their lot. Back to back overs with only three runs taken. This isn\u2019t good. 6th over: Australia 27-1 (Carey 14, Khawaja 5) Khaleel gets one to kick up at Khawaja to begin, played nicely with soft hands. He then finds his outside edge, spitting away through the cordon. It should be one but they get an overthrow when the ball hits the stumps when returned causing a brief moment of chaos as the Australians raced back. The two need to get busy now, this power play only has 24 balls remaining. 5th over: Australia 24-1 (Carey 14, Khawaja 2) Just one scoring shot from the over and it is a boundary, Carey playing from the crease in front of point with a well-timed push that makes it to the rope. Bhuvi beat him earlier in the over with a beauty and kept him honest after the four, bang on that off-stump line. A good early contest. 4th over: Australia 20-1 (Carey 10, Khawaja 2) Good work here from Alex Carey. He is the vice-captain of this side for a reason, well respected for his leadership skills. Khaleel oversteps for a second time already to make things a fraction easier, Carey cleaning mid-on with the free hit to record his first boundary. Later in the set he frees his arms to go over the cordon for a second four. More, please. \u201cYou must be excited,\u201d emails Amod Paranjape. \u201cBhuvi is back.\u201d This is true, I\u2019m fairly transparent when it comes to my favourite cricketers and you better believe Bhuvi is one of them. Look out if he bowls in tandem witih Kuldeep later. Blimey, this is a damning stat from the Prof. 3rd over: Australia 10-1 (Carey 1, Khawaja 2) Khawaja defends a few to get his eye in, taking the final ball of the set behind square for a couple to get off the mark. I can hear some grumbling behind me in the press box from a couple of former Australian batsmen. \u201cShocking shot,\u201d says one of Finch\u2019s dismissal. Here it is. Through him! Just a little bit of movement off the seam, enough to slip through the gap between Finch\u2019s bat and front pad. Goodnight Saigon. And that\u2019s Bhuvi\u2019s 100th ODI wicket. What a lovely way to get there, picking up the Australian captain. 2nd over: Australia 8-0 (Carey 1, Finch 6) Khaleel gets the new ball, in his seventh ODI. He\u2019s already played under three captains, according to the ABC call. He oversteps early on but Finch doesn\u2019t make contact with the free hit. He does strike well to finish, off the back foot through cover for three. Six from it. 1st over: Australia 2-0 (Carey 1, Finch 1) It takes Carey four balls to get off the mark, doing so with a push into the covers, racing to the danger end. Finch\u2019s turn and they are up for leg before first up! Not out, says Blocker Wilson, the ball making contact outside the line according to the replay. The captain gets his day started with a single from the final ball, keeping the strike. The players are out in the field! Bhuvi has the ball in his hand, Alex Carey taking the first delivery. Here we go. PLAY! We\u2019ve just had the Indigenous welcome and the national anthems out in the middle. \u201cMy wish list is simple,\u201d emails Neil Brandom. \u201cMaxwell a ton and 5 wickets. Australia to win? No that would be asking for too much.\u201d If he does achieve the latter, I\u2019ll be invading the pitch in celebration. It has been a big week for the Maxwell Mafia, that\u2019s for sure. I was pondering loudly yesterday. Is the decision to deck Australia out in retro kits from 1985-86 the best cricket news in Australia since Sandpaper? Well, maybe the Dubai draw. But this must be slotting into second, making so many people happy. That summer, the home side dominated the tri-series against India and New Zealand. More impotantly, Allan Border found the formula he required to win Australia\u2019s first World Cup 18 months later with Marsh, Jones, Boon, McDermott, Waugh and Reid. What Aaron Finch would give for a bit of that stability ahead of June. I do like this decision to give Alex Carey a go up the top, a player they are investing in heavily. Hardik Pandya has actually been sent home. I missed this earlier today, reports that he now will face the BCCI music for some fairly low-rent comments he and KL Rahul made on a talk show last weekend. Meanwhile, I don\u2019t want to make too much of this (what on Earth was his manager doing allowing this to happen?) but I have to share with you Monty on Mastermind. The pitch. The new normal in this format is quickly becoming 350 - this is certainly the expectation of England and India ahead of the World Cup. I noticed yesterday they had prepared the \u201c400\u201d graphic for the scoreboard. Had India batted first, perhaps. The teams as named at the toss. Australia: Aaron Finch (c), Alex Carey (wk), Shaun Marsh, Usman Khawaja, Peter Handscomb, Marcus Stoinis, Glenn Maxwell, Jhye Richardson, Nathan Lyon, Peter Siddle, Jason Behrendorff India: Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli (c), Ambati Rayudu, Dinesh Karthik, MS Dhoni (wk), Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Khaleel Ahmed So, just as we were told yesterday by Finch. As for India, no Hardik Pandya after his controversial week, left-arm quick Khaleel Ahmed winning the final bowling spot. Aaron Finch has won the toss and what a relief that will be for the hosts - they need eveything to go right. \u201cThe middle overs are an area we really need to brush up on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is about keeping wickets in hand for the back end.\u201d On the new (retro) kit: \u201cIsn\u2019t it brilliant?\u201d More on those shortly! Virat Kohli acknowledges that he, sure enough, would have batted first too. But with a top three that have collectively averaged in excess of 250 in 2018, it won\u2019t bother the boys in blue too much. I\u2019ll have India\u2019s XI with you as soon as we get the team sheets. And welcome to the SCG for it, on a stunning day. It is expected to be hot here this afternoon and the pitch looks as it should, so we should be in for tons of runs. For Australia, this is just about last chance cafe in terms of finding a combination that can work for their World Cup defence in six months from now. They have been dreadful in this format of the game of late, winning just three of their last 21. Yes, Smith and Warner will help, but this problem started well before then. To help with their major issue - losing wickets in the middle overs - Peter Handscomb and Usman Khawaja have been invited back to the engine room, alongside Shaun Marsh: experience all the way. Alex Carey, meanwhile, is up to the top of the list for the first time in 50-over internationals, partnering the captain Finch. Victorians bash brothers Stoinis and Maxwell follow, the aim to get them as many overs in the final ten or 15 as possible rather than coming in too early. Then the bowlers, of which they have Behrendorff on debut, Siddle playing his first ODI since the Carter Administration and Jhye Richardson just 22 years old. The experienced spinner is Lyon, back for another crack ahead of the World Cup, a man they want in England. I\u2019ll be back with you shortly to talk about the visitors, but for the time being, please do get in touch on the email or tweet. There is a lot more riding on this three-game series than may appear obvious, so it\u2019ll be worth tracking closely. Thanks for joining the OBO!",

It is now an international business and financial hub, an arts and culture destination, and a tourism hotspot with thriving nightlife. But what we want it to be known as most of all is a model for how to clear the air of tobacco smoke. Tobacco in Jordan starts with cigarettes. Smoking rates among men with low incomes are soaring. About 57% of men earning 100-250 Jordanian dinars a month (\u00a3110-\u00a3275) smoke regularly, and these men spend up to half of their income on cigarettes.

      "body": "<p>A huge queue snakes around Bolton Wanderers football club, but this is no regular Saturday. These supporters are here for a political rally. It is mid-September 2018, and Leave Means Leave has just started a tour of Brexit Britain. This cross-party pressure group was formed in 2016 to ensure a \u201cclean Brexit\u201d \u2013 in other words, a hard one. Now, with Brexit looking anything but clean, it has decided to step things up. Half a dozen rallies have been announced, and the organisers promise this is only the start.</p> \n<p>Outside the ground, people stand next to an open-topped Leave Means Leave battle bus to take selfies. Its colour scheme echoes that of the European Union flag, but with an extra fizz \u2013 blue and orange, instead of blue and yellow. The rally is sold out and takes place in a conference centre adjoining the stadium. It is packed with more than a thousand people, most of them middle-aged and elderly. On every seat, there is a little welcome pack for those who have paid their \u00a35.98 to attend: a Stop The Brexit Betrayal banner, a Believe In Britain pen, a union jack flag.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Nigel Farage walks in and it feels as if the sea has parted. He holds his hands aloft as the faithful roar him on, a messiah without portfolio</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Leave Means Leave\u2019s chairman, John Longworth, is the former director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, while its founder and vice chair, Richard Tice, is CEO of the asset management group Quidnet Capital. They make for impressive frontmen \u2013 Longworth with his record in business, Tice with his Dr Kildare good looks. Longworth tells the audience that, wherever he has worked, he has had a direct link to Brussels. \u201cI knew more than most people how the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\" title=\"\">European Union</a> worked. I knew what they were up to, and that\u2019s why I voted to leave.\u201d</p> \n<p>But nobody is here to listen to him. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, the next person needs little introduction,\u201d Tice begins. \u201cHe is one of the original Brexiteers. He has slowly but surely changed the course of British political history, and he, without question, will go down as one of the most significant political figures in the last 50 or 60 years\u2026 He has survived plane crashes that would have killed most people because he is a true patriot, ladies and gentlemen!\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage\" title=\"\">Nigel Farage</a> walks down the centre of the room and it feels as if the sea has parted. He holds his hands aloft as the faithful roar him on, a messiah without portfolio. While he has never been an MP, it is hard to argue with Tice\u2019s proposition that he is one of Britain\u2019s most influential politicians. At a time when rightwing politics are sweeping the world, Farage is the closest thing we have to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" title=\"\">Donald Trump</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/viktor-orban\" title=\"\">Viktor Orb\u00e1n</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jair-bolsonaro\" title=\"\">Jair Bolsonaro</a> \u2013 a populist insurgent. In 2016, while the mainstream parties encouraged the British public to remain in Europe, he mobilised 17.4 million people to vote leave. Now, after two years away, Farage has returned to the frontline \u2013 and he is furious that the \u201cpolitical class\u201d is trying to thwart the will of the people. If he is denied the Brexit he spent a quarter of a century battling for, where will he take the fight next?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dff175fe7bd6274d27ad496a2e8cc88d3039bca\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dff175fe7bd6274d27ad496a2e8cc88d3039bca/0_199_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters at the Westminster rally\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters at the Westminster rally.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When he speaks, Farage makes it clear that his is a reluctant return. He could be making squillions in the City, or breaking bread with Trump, rather than addressing the Brexiters of Bolton. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d have to do this again,\u201d he tells the crowd. \u201cI thought we\u2019d won on June 23 2016, in what was the greatest democratic exercise in the history of this nation. We voted to leave, and I thought our politicians would deliver. Well, they haven\u2019t. So you know what, we\u2019re back and we\u2019ll fight them again!\u201d</p> \n<p>Two days before the rally, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/donald-tusk\" title=\"\">Donald Tusk</a>, president of the European council, posted <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bn8Luwbjzf9/\" title=\"\">a photograph on Instagram</a> of himself offering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\" title=\"\">Theresa May</a> a selection of cakes, accompanied by the caption: \u201cA piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries.\u201d It was a reference to an earlier speech he had given, arguing that the prime minister could not cherrypick areas of the single market as Britain leaves the EU. Farage is apoplectic about this slight, which he sees as typical of the arrogance of the EU. His message is simple: no Eurocrat has the right to ridicule a British prime minister, however inept.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The EU, Farage states, is supremacist. Why should somebody from Europe have more right to live here than somebody from Africa or Asia?</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>He takes us back to the greatest day of his life. \u201cLet\u2019s remind ourselves what actually happened on June 23 2016, what happened despite the big political parties, despite the big companies, despite the big banks, despite big global politics, including of course President Obama coming to our country\u201d \u2013 \u201cBoooo!\u201d shout the crowd \u2013 \u201cto tell us what we should do. Despite the threats of disaster. Do you remember? From <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne\" title=\"\">George Osborne</a> there was going to be an emergency budget\u2026 They almost told us that if we dared to vote leave, a plague of black locusts would descend on our land. And despite all those threats, we voted to leave. We voted, folks, for independence.\u201d</p> \n<p>He says it is now up to Leave Means Leave supporters to ensure that Brexit is not betrayed. \u201cThe vast majority of our politicians want to dilute it, suspend it, overturn it. And one or two former senior politicians like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair\" title=\"\">Tony Blair</a>\u201d \u2013 \u201cBoooo!\u201d \u201cLock him up!\u201d \u2013 \u201cdo not want to give us Brexit.\u201d</p> \n<p>Farage foments the crowd with consummate skill. As he reaches a climax, every word becomes a sentence. \u201cWith Mrs May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/06/what-the-cabinet-has-agreed-at-chequers-brexit-meeting\" title=\"\">Chequers plan</a>, the very best we would get is Brexit. In. Name. Only. And. That. Is. Not. Good. Enough. Is it?\u201d It may be pantomime, but his anger is visceral. The language is clever and deliberate. Like his friend Trump, Farage is careful to distance himself from the political class. He might still be a member of the European parliament, but he is not One of Them. He is here to fight for the Everyman and the Everywoman, struggling to make themselves heard in a world dominated by globalisation and liberal elites.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"65246a0b-889b-4f28-9959-42e3e4babece\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DCnd8KA-iPk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In June 2016, Farage was less subtle. He posed in front of that notorious Ukip poster with the slogan Breaking Point: The EU Has Failed Us All, showing hundreds of refugees, most of them non-white, crossing the Croatia-Slovenia border in 2015. The poster was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-breaking-point-poster-queue-of-migrants\" title=\"\">reported to police for inciting racial hatred</a>, and even Farage\u2019s fellow Brexiter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove\" title=\"\">Michael Gove</a> said it made him \u201cshudder\u201d.</p> \n<p>Since then, Farage\u2019s frame of reference has become more coded. Blair, Obama, the BBC, London: he doesn\u2019t need to say much more than this to generate a boo from his followers \u2013 just the name, the institution, the city is enough. It\u2019s dog-whistle politics on a new level, although the crowd occasionally give him away: at a mention of London, an audience member heckles, \u201cThey\u2019re all foreigners in London!\u201d</p> \n<p>Now 54, Farage is in many ways a throwback to a Britannia that ruled the waves, when men and women were addressed as ladies and gentlemen, and prejudices were hidden behind tight smiles. There is a nihilistic sentimentality to his politics; his Britain is one where we still happily smoke our way to cancer and drink ourselves silly before lunch \u2013 because no bloody bureaucrat, least of all a European, is going to tell us what\u2019s good for us. But beneath the patriot-next-door persona, Farage has changed in many ways \u2013 in his language, his alliances, his status across the world. As Ukip has become increasingly irrelevant (membership was down from 39,000 in July 2016 to 23,600 in August 2018), Farage\u2019s global influence has grown.</p> \n<p>His friendships now cross continents, but they tend to be with white, male, rightwing populists: Trump,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/steve-bannon\" title=\"\"> Steve Bannon</a> or Hungary\u2019s prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Last April, Farage tweeted his support for Orb\u00e1n, who has been accused of Islamophobia and antisemitism, calling him <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage/status/983251627980226560\" title=\"\">\u201cthe strongest leader in Europe and the EU\u2019s biggest nightmare\u201d</a>. The pair share an antipathy towards the Jewish Hungarian investor and philanthropist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/george-soros\" title=\"\">George Soros, who has given away much of his vast fortune through the Open Society foundation, \u201cto build vibrant and tolerant democracies\u201d</a>. In June, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gXsOvcs_Ks\" title=\"\">Farage told Fox News</a>: \u201cSoros is actively encouraging people to come across the Mediterranean, to flood Europe\u2026 Thank goodness Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Hungary have got the confidence to stand up against him\u2026 If you criticise Soros, his media friends accuse you of being an antisemite. It is quite extraordinary. I really feel that Soros in many ways is the biggest danger to the entire western world.\u201d</p> \n<p>Today\u2019s rally in Bolton is coming to an end, and Tice asks everybody to wave their flags and placards, and to make as big a noise as possible. \u201cStand up and let the world see that we believe in Britain, and we want to stop the Brexit betrayal!\u201d The room cheers as one.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22b4df933d501f0a1320dae89d657d44ab7ac342\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22b4df933d501f0a1320dae89d657d44ab7ac342/0_398_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An attendee in Bournemouth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Those who have paid \u00a35.98 to attend get a Stop The Brexit Betrayal banner, a Believe In Britain pen and a union jack.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cGod bless Great Britain!\u201d shouts a voice from the back of the hall.</p> \n<p>I start to feel self-conscious. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to wave your flag?\u201d says the man next to me.</p> \n<p>On the way out, I meet a woman dressed in floral pinks and purples. Joan Johnson was chair of Bolton Ukip, until she defected back to the Tories after Britain voted to leave; like many Ukip members, she felt the party had served its purpose. But she\u2019s still a Farage fan. Is he Britain\u2019s greatest populist politician? \u201cYes, I think he is.\u201d What does it mean to be a great populist? \u201cIt means he\u2019s a good leader. He\u2019s very outspoken, and he tells the truth. He is popular and he is populist, in that he\u2019s a leader of the people.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a typical politician,\u201d adds Diane Parkinson, Johnson\u2019s friend and another former Ukip activist. \u201cThere\u2019s no diplomacy, no sitting on the fence. He\u2019s an outcast.\u201d Farage has this in common with other successful populists \u2013 an ability to portray himself as the outsider: little David with a fag in one hand and a pint of bitter in the other, kicking out at the all-powerful Goliath.</p> \n<p>Bolton is an ethnically diverse city; in 2011, <a href=\"https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/11419690.Warning_as_Bolton_population_predicted_to_hit_300_000_in_20_years/\" title=\"\">20% of its population did not identify as white British</a>. Yet everybody here today appears to be white. \u201cYes, I noticed that,\u201d Johnson says, before adding that there is no tension between the city\u2019s white and Asian populations. She does not believe relationships between Bolton\u2019s Asian and European migrants are as harmonious. \u201cA lot of the Indians and Pakistanis have their own businesses and they work hard at it. But then you\u2019ve got your people from eastern Europe coming in, perhaps also wanting to set up businesses, and there are fights.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cToo many cultures,\u201d Parkinson says. \u201cThe eastern Europeans saw an opportunity to come over. I\u2019d do the same. It\u2019s all about survival. They\u2019re taking low-paid jobs, but the British people don\u2019t want those low-paid jobs because they\u2019ve got the benefits system to fall back on.\u201d</p> \n<p>On the bus back to Manchester, I meet Alexa Michael, a Conservative councillor for Beckenham in London. \u201cNigel says what a lot of ordinary people are thinking but are too frightened to say,\u201d she tells me. \u201cHe\u2019s got the common touch, even though he\u2019s got quite a posh background. It\u2019s no surprise that people in Bolton, the old mill towns, what you might call working-class areas, were more inclined to vote leave than some of the more prosperous areas.\u201d</p> \n<p>And yet the Bolton audience more closely resembled her \u2013 smartly dressed, very middle class \u2013 not the working-class voters we are often told Farage appeals to.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7590ce79a6acfd1e11fc42968586f4992d15e0a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7590ce79a6acfd1e11fc42968586f4992d15e0a/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man's legs in front of Leave Means Leave and Believe in Britain banners\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>It\u2019s a week later, and the battlebus has moved on to Birmingham\u2019s National Conference Centre. Again the event is sold out and the 1,000-strong crowd is every bit as white and grey as Bolton\u2019s. A dozen miles away, the Conservative party is holding its annual conference. \u201cI want you to make a big noise today,\u201d Longworth tells the audience, \u201cnot least because we want those people down the road to hear you.\u201d </p> \n<p>Tice takes over, to drum home the purpose of the meeting. \u201cWe know why we\u2019re here, don\u2019t we? We want to send a very simple message that they should just Chuck Chequers.\u201d Chuck Chequers; No Deal? No Problem; Leave Means Leave: the leavers have both the simplest arguments and the strongest soundbites.</p> \n<p>He makes a joke about the battlebus. \u201cWe had such fun deciding how big a number we were going to put on the bus.\u201d This is a reference to the \u00a3350m Boris Johnson emblazoned on his Vote Leave bus, the sum we were meant to be saving on EU membership and spending on the NHS every week (he had not accounted for rebates, grants and subsidies). \u201cI was all for putting \u2018Save \u00a339bn\u2019!\u201d Tice says. He pauses to let the audience laugh. \u201cUnbelievably, I was outvoted \u2013 but I believe in democracy.\u201d Thirty nine billion pounds is now the anticipated Brexit divorce bill.</p> \n<p>Conservative MP Peter Bone takes to the stage. He talks of the horror of being at the mercy of Europe. \u201cWe didn\u2019t fight world wars\u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cNo more German cars!\u201d shouts a member of the audience.</p> \n<p>\u201c\u2026 to be subservient,\u201d Bone continues. \u201cWe want to make our own laws in our own countries... The thing that annoyed people enormously was, when we make laws they\u2019re not judged by our own judges, they\u2019re not decided in our supreme court \u2013 they\u2019re decided somewhere in Europe by a bunch of judges, half of whom are not qualified anyway.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cNo, they aren\u2019t,\u201d cries a woman at the back.</p> \n<p>This might be Margaret Atwood\u2019s Gilead; you would fear for the safety of those European judges were they here today.</p> \n<p>Bone does a decent job of whipping up the anger, but he knows he\u2019s only the warm-up act. \u201cI think there\u2019s someone else,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>\u201cMr Brexit!\u201d calls a voice in the crowd.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4df5e57ad6eb134aca222b14495f596cef84bc69\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4df5e57ad6eb134aca222b14495f596cef84bc69/0_183_5500_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters at the Leave Means Leave rally at QEII Centre in Westminster\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018May is too weak to negotiate with the European commission,\u2019 says Farage. \u2018I\u2019d rather we sent someone like Trump.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cNigel Farage! Mr Brexit, as somebody says at the front.\u201d Bone gets his biggest cheer, and Tice takes over for the already familiar introduction. \u201cThe vilification, abuse, threats to his family, what he\u2019s put up with is unbelievable. His courage manifested when he was unfortunately in a very serious plane crash on one election day. It would have killed many people. Bless him: he dragged himself out, wiped away the odd bit of blood, dusted himself down and promptly lit a cigarette. He is a true patriot. He is possibly the original Brexiter.\u201d</p> \n<p>Again the sea splits for Farage, and again he looks more spiv than saviour. There is a touch of Private Walker, the black-market wheeler-dealer in Dad\u2019s Army, whose absence from the regular armed forces was explained by a corned-beef allergy. \u201cGood afternoon, Birmingham,\u201d he begins. \u201cI\u2019ve given the best part of my adult life, battling, fighting, campaigning for one thing \u2013 that we, the British people, should be masters of our own destiny, running our own lives, in control of our own country. And. That. Referendum. On. June. 23rd. When. We. Won. That. Vote. Was. The. Happiest. Day. Of. My Life.\u201d </p> \n<p>Farage has an advantage over many politicians in knowing how to make his audience laugh. \u201cWe were told by the party leaders that whatever we decided they would abide by,\u201d he says. \u201cIndeed, do you remember Mr Cameron?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cBoooo!\u201d comes the catcall.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s surprising, because most of the country has forgotten about him!\u201d There is laughter across the room.</p> \n<p>\u201cMr Cameron spent \u00a39m of taxpayers\u2019 money putting that outrageous leaflet through every door in the land.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cShame! Shame!\u201d Cameron is heckled in absentia.</p> \n<p>\u201cHow I enjoyed posting mine back through the letterbox of No 10,\u201d Farage continues, \u201cwith a few suitable annotations, but not ones I am going to share with you on a public platform.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4badb65b0faf19336168ef727f3098864b900aa0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4badb65b0faf19336168ef727f3098864b900aa0/0_972_3470_4308/805.jpg\" alt=\"A Leave Means Leave supporter with a union jack\" width=\"805\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Then he\u2019s back on the attack. \u201cNow we are told that we didn\u2019t understand what we were voting for. You. Are. All. Thick. And. Pig. Ignorant. They even have the effrontery to tell us that people were lied to \u2013 despite the fact that the greatest lie of all was told back in the 1970s, when my parents\u2019 generation were told they were joining nothing more than a common market which was about friendship and free trade. Even if Boris\u2019s figures on the side of a bus were a bit on the high side, it is nothing to the half a century of lies we have been told by the establishment.\u201d</p> \n<p>Farage\u2019s argument here is straightforward. The referendum was nothing to do with the terms of leaving, and nobody thought it was; we were simply asked whether we wanted in or out. He even attempts to claim the moral high ground when it comes to the migration argument. The EU, he states, is supremacist. Why should somebody from Europe have more right to live in our country than, say, somebody from Africa or Asia? It\u2019s the only line that is not met with a resounding cheer. </p> \n<p>But by the time he is done, calling on the audience to stop the Brexit betrayal, they are chanting for more. Lynne, a friendly, middle-aged woman who has been sharing her Polos with me, is on her feet. I ask her why she feels so strongly. She talks about the need for sovereignty, to be able to make our own laws and reclaim our pride. Is it anything to do with immigration? \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cNot really.\u201d She pauses. \u201cBut Birmingham isn\u2019t as clean as it used to be. Is it? They leave their furniture in the street.\u201d Who \u2013 the Europeans? \u201cNo, the Muslims. There are areas that are predominantly Muslim. I\u2019m not racist. They\u2019re not to blame. But they don\u2019t love our country like we do. They put mattresses in the street. They all drive nice cars, mind \u2013 Mercs and BMWs. And then they\u2019ve got their rubbish piled up.\u201d She offers me another Polo.</p> \n<p>I look for Farage, but the man of the people has done a disappearing act. The last time we met, in 2009, he took me to his local pub for breakfast (three pints of Landlord), told me his political hero was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/16/enoch-powell-rivers-of-blood-speech-brexit-right\" title=\"\">Enoch Powell</a>, and talked with pride of his German wife Kirsten and his love of a good lapdance club. But the more renowned this populist becomes, the less accessible he is; Farage declined to be interviewed for this article.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the less starry members of Leave Means Leave are happy to talk. I ask Peter Bone what populism means to him. \u201cDoesn\u2019t populist mean what most people want?\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Longworth comes up with a similar definition. \u201cIt\u2019s to do with being popular among people, so if populism means we\u2019re actually supporting people\u2019s democratic rights, I\u2019m all for it.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The language is tough and militaristic, and Farage\u2019s delivery chilling: \u2018Meet your MPs face to face. Make them feel the heat'</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>As the audience leave, I scan the hall for somebody who looks a bit younger, and spot Jared Day. He is in his 20s, and a wheelchair-user. Day is a smart, engaging man who voted remain but has since become a leaver. Why? \u201cThe EU\u2019s lack of respect. I thought the photo that Donald Tusk posted was very distasteful.\u201d</p> \n<p>Unlike many politicians, Day has no problem explaining why populism means much more than being popular. \u201cPopulism is more about nationalist lines, the nation state. When you hear about populist governments, they tend to be more internal-looking, almost isolationist.\u201d</p> \n<p>Contemporary populism is by its nature oppositional. In his 2016 book <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-populist-explosion-how-the-great-recession-transformed-american-and-european-politics-9780997126440.html\" title=\"\">The Populist Explosion</a>, a study of how the great recession shaped US and European politics, author John B Judis distinguishes between left- and rightwing populism as follows: \u201cLeftwing populists champion the people against an elite or an establishment. Theirs is a vertical politics of the bottom and middle, arrayed against the top. Rightwing populists champion the people against an elite that they accuse of favouring a third group, which can consist, for instance, of immigrants, Islamists, or African-American militants. Rightwing populism is triadic: it looks upward, but also down upon an out group.\u201d This feels very much the Leave Means Leave approach. </p> \n<p>On my way out, I catch two pairs of sisters chatting. Like Day, their youth makes them stand out. Jill and her sister, who does not give her name, are wearing Brexit sweatshirts, while two identical twins, who also won\u2019t give their names, are formally dressed in skirts and jackets; they could be extras for a film about the suffragette movement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6dbe32102b28dba2bb84780a14e76eb2e1a55c50\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6dbe32102b28dba2bb84780a14e76eb2e1a55c50/0_360_5500_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Attendees stand and clap to show their support in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Attendees show their support in London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jill is a chemistry teacher from Sheffield who says she wants Brexit for her pupils. She believes there will be more money for them when we leave, and they will have a better chance of getting decent jobs. One of the twins also teaches, and is looking forward to a brighter future. All four women tell me they despise the mainstream media, particularly the Guardian, because it is a purveyor of fake news. What they dislike most is the notion that they must be ignorant or bigoted to have voted leave. The twins take up Farage\u2019s theme, finishing each other\u2019s sentences.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey demonise us\u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201c\u2026 And make out we\u2019re really stupid\u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201c\u2026 That we don\u2019t know what we voted for\u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jill, who is wearing union jack trainers, says: \u201cDemonise is the exact word. I so object to that. I\u2019m not far right or racist. And that, I\u2019m afraid, is the media.\u201d</p> \n<p>The women talk about wages being undercut by EU workers, how hard the trade unions have fought for the minimum wage, the need for controlled migration and to look after our own.</p> \n<p>As for the notion that British people don\u2019t want many of the jobs the Europeans do, Jill is not having any of it. \u201cAbsolute rubbish,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying the kids I teach are lazy. They\u2019re not. They want a job and can\u2019t get one, because it\u2019s been taken by somebody from the European Union.\u201d</p> \n<p>All four women sing from the same hymn sheet, despite coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum. \u201cThe main thing that got me into politics was the magnificent patriot Nigel Farage,\u201d Jill says. The twins are Corbynistas, dismayed that the Labour leader has suppressed his anti-Europe instincts.</p> \n<p>The conversation leaves my head spinning; in some ways, left and right seem an irrelevance in Brexit Britain. Perhaps that\u2019s why some Labour MPs have been happy to align themselves with Leave Means Leave. Yet look more closely and you realise that the group is not as cross-party as it would have us believe. All six members of its advisory board are white, male Conservatives. Of the 25 MPs it names as supporters on its website, 24 are Conservatives or members of the DUP. The one exception is the independent MP Kelvin Hopkins, who was suspended from the Labour party in 2017 after it was alleged he sexually harassed a local activist. (He has denied the claims.) Of the 44 prominent members <a href=\"https://www.leavemeansleave.eu/who-we-are/\" title=\"\">pictured on Leave Means Leave\u2019s website</a>, all are white and 43 are men; Andrea Jenkyns, the Conservative who succeeded Ed Balls as MP for Morley and Outwood, is the only woman.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98a846dc40883c9e151088e8b7c7ab315a456d4e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98a846dc40883c9e151088e8b7c7ab315a456d4e/0_447_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man holding union jack balloons at the Bournemouth rally\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Balloons in Bournemouth \u2013 every rally is sold out.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It\u2019s a Tuesday night in October and we\u2019re in Bournemouth, which voted to leave Europe by a margin of 9%. Like the other events, tonight\u2019s rally is sold out. Before the speakers start, the audience is shown a film about how intransigent the EU has been in negotiating Brexit. The narrator asks: \u201cWhen we asked for cooperation on security, the boys in Brussels said <em>Non</em>! When Mrs May offered flexibility on Labour mobility, the boys in Brussels said <em>Non</em>! Mrs May even offered them more of our money, and this time the boys in Brussels said they wanted more! The UK has consistently offered the boys in Brussels huge concessions yet it is never enough for these unaccountable Eurocrats who, let\u2019s remember, spend an awful lot of their time\u2026 drunk.\u201d</p> \n<p>On the screen, a cartoon inebriated Eurocrat topples over, and the crowd cheer. Alcohol is a recurring theme tonight. JD Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin was due to make an appearance, but he has gone down with a tummy bug, so we are played a video of him addressing a rally in Torquay the previous week instead.</p> \n<p>\u201cLord Bamford, Sir James Dyson, Tim Martin\u2026 have you noticed how all the great entrepreneurs are Brexiters?\u201d John Longworth says. \u201cTim set up a chain of almost 1,000 pubs.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd Nigel\u2019s drunk in most of them!\u201d heckles a man in front of me affectionately.</p> \n<p>Tice has perfected his introduction over the past month. \u201cHe is possibly the original, truest Brexiteer!\u201d he begins.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe should be prime minister!\u201d cries a voice from the front.</p> \n<p>Tice tells the story of Farage\u2019s helicopter crash, this time leaving a gap for the audience to applaud each heroic act. \u201cIt would have killed many people, but not our good friend.

I\u2019m going to take issue with the deputy chair\u2019s introduction. I\u2019m not the original Brexiteer. That was Henry VIII.\u201d He appears to be in a jovial mood. \u201cMy day started when I got off the battlebus in Christchurch. I went round Christchurch market, and I met some stallholders and members of the public, and then it all went wrong.\u201d Pause. \u201cWe found a pub.\u201d</p> \n<p>This is Farage the seaside standup, and the audience lap it up. \u201cThe day after the referendum, there was an emergency debate in the European parliament. I thought I\u2019d better show up, you know, \u2019cos I\u2019ve worked quite hard over there. I\u2019ve always tried to make positive and helpful contributions. And there waiting for me was European commission president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jean-claude-juncker\" title=\"\">Jean-Claude Juncker</a>, who came up, put an arm round me, and said\u2026 \u2018Bastard!\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>The hall erupts. Then Farage flips the mood. \u201cI said to them, \u2018That morning when I came here, 17 years ago, I said I would lead a campaign to take the United Kingdom out of the European Union, and you laughed at me. Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018you\u2019re not laughing now, are you?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>And suddenly Farage flips again; now he\u2019s mobilising his troops. \u201cThis is the most important campaign that has ever been fought in British history. This. Campaign. Is. About. Right. And. Wrong. We are simply asking our politicians to do what they promised.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>This is the first rally in the heart of remain-land \u2013 London \u2013 and the mood is darker. There\u2019s a sense of the battle lines hardening</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>There was a time, he says, when he trusted May when she said that no deal was better than a bad deal. \u201cShe kept on telling us Brexit means Brexit, but little did we know that she is a woman who is too weak to negotiate with the European commission.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI\u2019d much rather we sent someone like Trump, personally!\u201d The audience applauds.</p> \n<p>Now it\u2019s time for strategy, as Farage tells supporters how to confront MPs. \u201cI don\u2019t want you writing letters to them. Go and visit them at their surgeries, queue around the block, meet them face to face, make them feel the heat, make them understand that being part of a customs union, being a vassal state with laws made somewhere else, is unacceptable. And that if they do this, you will never give them your vote again. Make. Them. Feel. The. Heat. We in Leave Means Leave are reactivating the people\u2019s army.\u201d </p> \n<p>The language is tough and militaristic, and Farage\u2019s delivery chilling. He warns that if he is forced to fight a second referendum we\u2019ll see a very different Farage: \u201cThis time, no more Mr Nice Guy.\u201d I can\u2019t help thinking back to his victory speech after the referendum, delivered at 4am on 24 June 2016. Farage boasted that Brexit had been achieved \u201cwithout a single bullet being fired\u201d. It was only eight days after the strongly pro-EU Labour MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jo-cox\" title=\"\">Jo Cox</a> had been murdered on her way to a constituency surgery. Her killer, Thomas Mair, shouted \u201cKeep Britain independent\u201dand \u201cBritain first\u201d as he shot and stabbed her. But Farage appeared to have forgotten that.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>On 13 November, Theresa May announces that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/13/cabinet-members-called-in-to-sign-off-mays-brexit-deal\" title=\"\">the UK and the European Union have reached an agreement</a>; the next day the Cabinet signs off on the deal. Leave Means Leave organises a protest outside Downing Street. On 15 November, Brexit secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-raab\" title=\"\">Dominic Raab</a> is one of four ministers to resign amid calls for the prime minister to step down.</p> \n<p>Britain remains gridlocked; Westminster is in chaos and yet nothing changes. On 10 December, the day before the Commons is due to have its say on the deal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/10/theresa-may-postpones-brexit-deal-meaningful-vote-eu\" title=\"\">May announces the vote will be delayed</a>. The following day Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee, announces that the threshold has been reached for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister; at least 48 letters have been submitted by Tory MPs. Although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2018/dec/12/tory-mps-trigger-vote-of-no-confidence-in-may-amid-brexit-uncertainty-politics-live\" title=\"\">May survives, winning by 200 votes to 117</a>, she appears to have as little chance of getting her deal through the Commons as she did before.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, there is a similar upheaval in Farage\u2019s world \u2013 revolution leading to stasis. On 22 November, Ukip leader Gerard Batten announces that he has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/22/tommy-robinson-ukip-grooming-gangs-adviser\" title=\"\">appointed far-right activist and former EDL leader Tommy Robinson</a> as a special adviser on \u201crape gangs\u201d and prison reform. In an interview on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Farage says he is \u201cappalled\u201d, that Ukip is becoming a party of \u201cstreet activism\u201d, and that Batten has sabotaged his own efforts to make Ukip \u201ca non-racist, non-sectarian party\u201d. This is the same Farage who masterminded the Breaking Point poster; the same Farage who talked only days ago about mobilising a people\u2019s army. On 4 December, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/04/nigel-farage-quits-ukip-over-fixation-anti-muslim-policies\" title=\"\">he announces that he is quitting Ukip</a> \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d: he has lost his battle to \u201cprofessionalise\u201d the party he helped found in 1993. But the truth is, he has outgrown Ukip. Its once marginal voice is now mainstream, and Farage has bigger political fish to fry. </p> \n<p>***</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97242de7fc5ee69385c5118311532309714d5956\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97242de7fc5ee69385c5118311532309714d5956/0_340_5500_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg at the London rally.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg at the London rally.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It is 14 December, and all the big guns are out for the Leave Means Leave rally at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre, opposite the Houses of Parliament. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jacob-rees-mogg\" title=\"\">Jacob Rees-Mogg</a>, JD Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin, the DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson and, of course, Farage, line up to deliver the same message \u2013 No Deal? No Problem \u2013 only with more urgency. There is a new chant: \u201cLet\u2019s go bigger than Europe. Let\u2019s go Global. Let\u2019s Go WTO.\u201d Inconsistency appears to be a virtue for this populist campaign; globalism is now presented as a positive rather than a negative.</p> \n<p>Tonight, the two Labour MPs who have spoken at previous rallies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/katehoey\" title=\"\">Kate Hoey</a> and Graham Stringer, are on the same bill, giving the event a more genuinely cross-party feel. But there is nothing diverse about the audience, and the whiteness is, if anything, even more stark than at previous rallies \u2013 not least because nearly every security officer on the door is black.</p> \n<p>This is the first rally held in the heart of remain-land \u2013 London \u2013 and the mood is darker, more defiant. There is a sense of the battle lines hardening: only two days ago, chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond\" title=\"\">Philip Hammond</a> described hard Brexiters as \u201cextremists\u201d. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Let us be ready for that referendum \u2013 if it comes we\u2019ll win it next time. By. A. Much. Bigger. Majority</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Tonight, all six speakers have the knack of being able to incite the crowd or make them laugh \u2013 even the antediluvian Rees-Mogg, dubbed the honourable member for the 18th century. Hoey asks how we can trust the government to take us out of the EU when it is led by a prime minister who is a remainer, a chancellor who regards Brexiters as extremists and a Speaker \u201cwho has a Bollocks to Brexit sticker on his car\u201d. Tim Martin concludes his speech by quoting Paul Simon (\u201cYou just slip out the back, Jack/Make a new plan, Stan/You don\u2019t need to be coy, Roy/Just get yourself free\u201d). Puce-faced Sammy Wilson delivers a barnstorming unionist speech (\u201cThe EU is demanding the price for leaving is splitting the United Kingdom. <em>Never</em>!\u201d) and says that not even Arthur Daley would have had the brass to flog the Chequers deal to the British public.</p> \n<p>As always, though, Farage is the star turn. He makes the familiar jokes about booze, dismisses the \u201cjumped-up foreign bureaucrats\u201d of Brussels, and describes the Italian government (which has scrapped humanitarian protection status for asylum seekers) as \u201crather splendid\u201d. But this is a more muted, restrained Farage. He admits he is worried.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid, folks, I don\u2019t see the great Brexit betrayal as anywhere near finished. I\u2019m now more fearful than at any time I have been during this process that, outrageous and monstrous though it is, we\u2019re going to finish up being sent back for a second referendum\u2026 My message, folks, is it would be wrong of us not to get ready, not to prepare for the worst-case scenario\u2026 Let us be ready not just to fight back, not just to be ready for that referendum, but if it comes we\u2019ll win it next time. By. A. Much. Bigger. Majority.\u201d Back in January 2018, Farage surprised everyone by calling for a second referendum, on the grounds it would deliver a bigger leave majority. But it was a classic Farage blip, and he has never called for one since. Last August, he dismissed the idea as \u201cnot the people\u2019s vote, but the George Soros vote\u201d.</p> \n<p>After his speech in London, Farage is mobbed. A huddle forms around him, comprised mainly of the few young people in the audience. A woman in her 20s, draped in a union jack, asks for a selfie. Her friend, also draped in a union jack, pushes her way forward. \u201cExcuse me, seeing as I got her these tickets, the least you can do is give me a kiss,\u201d she says to Farage.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d2662b7cf59edb17abe5c662d9b6f2fda96630d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d2662b7cf59edb17abe5c662d9b6f2fda96630d/0_183_5500_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage is mobbed by supporters at the Westminster rally\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage is mobbed by supporters at the Westminster rally.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is the closest I\u2019ve been to him in three months of following the Leave Means Leave campaign \u2013 within shouting distance. So I do just that. Earlier this evening, someone in the audience asked who people should vote for, now that Farage has quit Ukip. The question went unanswered, so I ask again. \u201cNigel, who should we vote for?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWho asked that?\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>\u201cI asked that,\u201d I bellow, deep within the bosom of the Faragistas. He looks at me.</p> \n<p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s find out, shall we? At the moment I couldn\u2019t vote for anybody. But let\u2019s see how this plays out. The cards haven\u2019t fallen yet. I meant what I said tonight. All the Eurosceptics are hoping we\u2019re going to get through this, but I\u2019m actually more pessimistic.\u201d</p> \n<p>Do we need to mobilise? \u201cYes. When you build an army, you don\u2019t do it wanting to fight a war. But if a war happens, you\u2019ve got it. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve now got to do.\u201d And with that he\u2019s off, flanked by two security men.</p> \n<p>I shout one of his own slogans after him as he walks away. \u201cNigel, no more Mr Nice Guy?\u201d He turns on his heels, walks back and looks me in the face. For once there isn\u2019t a hint of a smile. \u201cOh listen. Listen. If they make us do this again, I shall be a bit tougher than last time.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article forms part of the Guardian\u2019s ongoing series, The new populism; read more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/the-new-populism\">here</a>.</p> \n<p>If you would like to make a comment on this piece, and be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "A huge queue snakes around Bolton Wanderers football club, but this is no regular Saturday. These supporters are here for a political rally. It is mid-September 2018, and Leave Means Leave has just started a tour of Brexit Britain. This cross-party pressure group was formed in 2016 to ensure a \u201cclean Brexit\u201d \u2013 in other words, a hard one. Now, with Brexit looking anything but clean, it has decided to step things up. Half a dozen rallies have been announced, and the organisers promise this is only the start. Outside the ground, people stand next to an open-topped Leave Means Leave battle bus to take selfies. Its colour scheme echoes that of the European Union flag, but with an extra fizz \u2013 blue and orange, instead of blue and yellow. The rally is sold out and takes place in a conference centre adjoining the stadium. It is packed with more than a thousand people, most of them middle-aged and elderly. On every seat, there is a little welcome pack for those who have paid their \u00a35.98 to attend: a Stop The Brexit Betrayal banner, a Believe In Britain pen, a union jack flag. Leave Means Leave\u2019s chairman, John Longworth, is the former director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, while its founder and vice chair, Richard Tice, is CEO of the asset management group Quidnet Capital. They make for impressive frontmen \u2013 Longworth with his record in business, Tice with his Dr Kildare good looks. Longworth tells the audience that, wherever he has worked, he has had a direct link to Brussels. \u201cI knew more than most people how the European Union worked. I knew what they were up to, and that\u2019s why I voted to leave.\u201d But nobody is here to listen to him. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, the next person needs little introduction,\u201d Tice begins. \u201cHe is one of the original Brexiteers. He has slowly but surely changed the course of British political history, and he, without question, will go down as one of the most significant political figures in the last 50 or 60 years\u2026 He has survived plane crashes that would have killed most people because he is a true patriot, ladies and gentlemen!\u201d Nigel Farage walks down the centre of the room and it feels as if the sea has parted. He holds his hands aloft as the faithful roar him on, a messiah without portfolio. While he has never been an MP, it is hard to argue with Tice\u2019s proposition that he is one of Britain\u2019s most influential politicians. At a time when rightwing politics are sweeping the world, Farage is the closest thing we have to a Donald Trump, Viktor Orb\u00e1n or Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 a populist insurgent. In 2016, while the mainstream parties encouraged the British public to remain in Europe, he mobilised 17.4 million people to vote leave. Now, after two years away, Farage has returned to the frontline \u2013 and he is furious that the \u201cpolitical class\u201d is trying to thwart the will of the people. If he is denied the Brexit he spent a quarter of a century battling for, where will he take the fight next? When he speaks, Farage makes it clear that his is a reluctant return. He could be making squillions in the City, or breaking bread with Trump, rather than addressing the Brexiters of Bolton. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d have to do this again,\u201d he tells the crowd. \u201cI thought we\u2019d won on June 23 2016, in what was the greatest democratic exercise in the history of this nation. We voted to leave, and I thought our politicians would deliver. Well, they haven\u2019t. So you know what, we\u2019re back and we\u2019ll fight them again!\u201d Two days before the rally, Donald Tusk, president of the European council, posted a photograph on Instagram of himself offering Theresa May a selection of cakes, accompanied by the caption: \u201cA piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries.\u201d It was a reference to an earlier speech he had given, arguing that the prime minister could not cherrypick areas of the single market as Britain leaves the EU. Farage is apoplectic about this slight, which he sees as typical of the arrogance of the EU. His message is simple: no Eurocrat has the right to ridicule a British prime minister, however inept. He takes us back to the greatest day of his life. \u201cLet\u2019s remind ourselves what actually happened on June 23 2016, what happened despite the big political parties, despite the big companies, despite the big banks, despite big global politics, including of course President Obama coming to our country\u201d \u2013 \u201cBoooo!\u201d shout the crowd \u2013 \u201cto tell us what we should do. Despite the threats of disaster. Do you remember? From George Osborne there was going to be an emergency budget\u2026 They almost told us that if we dared to vote leave, a plague of black locusts would descend on our land. And despite all those threats, we voted to leave. We voted, folks, for independence.\u201d He says it is now up to Leave Means Leave supporters to ensure that Brexit is not betrayed. \u201cThe vast majority of our politicians want to dilute it, suspend it, overturn it. And one or two former senior politicians like Tony Blair\u201d \u2013 \u201cBoooo!\u201d \u201cLock him up!\u201d \u2013 \u201cdo not want to give us Brexit.\u201d Farage foments the crowd with consummate skill. As he reaches a climax, every word becomes a sentence. \u201cWith Mrs May\u2019s Chequers plan, the very best we would get is Brexit. In. Name. Only. And. That. Is. Not. Good. Enough. Is it?\u201d It may be pantomime, but his anger is visceral. The language is clever and deliberate. Like his friend Trump, Farage is careful to distance himself from the political class. He might still be a member of the European parliament, but he is not One of Them. He is here to fight for the Everyman and the Everywoman, struggling to make themselves heard in a world dominated by globalisation and liberal elites. In June 2016, Farage was less subtle. He posed in front of that notorious Ukip poster with the slogan Breaking Point: The EU Has Failed Us All, showing hundreds of refugees, most of them non-white, crossing the Croatia-Slovenia border in 2015. The poster was reported to police for inciting racial hatred, and even Farage\u2019s fellow Brexiter Michael Gove said it made him \u201cshudder\u201d. Since then, Farage\u2019s frame of reference has become more coded. Blair, Obama, the BBC, London: he doesn\u2019t need to say much more than this to generate a boo from his followers \u2013 just the name, the institution, the city is enough. It\u2019s dog-whistle politics on a new level, although the crowd occasionally give him away: at a mention of London, an audience member heckles, \u201cThey\u2019re all foreigners in London!\u201d Now 54, Farage is in many ways a throwback to a Britannia that ruled the waves, when men and women were addressed as ladies and gentlemen, and prejudices were hidden behind tight smiles. There is a nihilistic sentimentality to his politics; his Britain is one where we still happily smoke our way to cancer and drink ourselves silly before lunch \u2013 because no bloody bureaucrat, least of all a European, is going to tell us what\u2019s good for us. But beneath the patriot-next-door persona, Farage has changed in many ways \u2013 in his language, his alliances, his status across the world. As Ukip has become increasingly irrelevant (membership was down from 39,000 in July 2016 to 23,600 in August 2018), Farage\u2019s global influence has grown. His friendships now cross continents, but they tend to be with white, male, rightwing populists: Trump, Steve Bannon or Hungary\u2019s prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Last April, Farage tweeted his support for Orb\u00e1n, who has been accused of Islamophobia and antisemitism, calling him \u201cthe strongest leader in Europe and the EU\u2019s biggest nightmare\u201d. The pair share an antipathy towards the Jewish Hungarian investor and philanthropist George Soros, who has given away much of his vast fortune through the Open Society foundation, \u201cto build vibrant and tolerant democracies\u201d. In June, Farage told Fox News: \u201cSoros is actively encouraging people to come across the Mediterranean, to flood Europe\u2026 Thank goodness Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Hungary have got the confidence to stand up against him\u2026 If you criticise Soros, his media friends accuse you of being an antisemite. It is quite extraordinary. I really feel that Soros in many ways is the biggest danger to the entire western world.\u201d Today\u2019s rally in Bolton is coming to an end, and Tice asks everybody to wave their flags and placards, and to make as big a noise as possible. \u201cStand up and let the world see that we believe in Britain, and we want to stop the Brexit betrayal!\u201d The room cheers as one. \u201cGod bless Great Britain!\u201d shouts a voice from the back of the hall. I start to feel self-conscious. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to wave your flag?\u201d says the man next to me. On the way out, I meet a woman dressed in floral pinks and purples. Joan Johnson was chair of Bolton Ukip, until she defected back to the Tories after Britain voted to leave; like many Ukip members, she felt the party had served its purpose. But she\u2019s still a Farage fan. Is he Britain\u2019s greatest populist politician? \u201cYes, I think he is.\u201d What does it mean to be a great populist? \u201cIt means he\u2019s a good leader. He\u2019s very outspoken, and he tells the truth. He is popular and he is populist, in that he\u2019s a leader of the people.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not a typical politician,\u201d adds Diane Parkinson, Johnson\u2019s friend and another former Ukip activist. \u201cThere\u2019s no diplomacy, no sitting on the fence. He\u2019s an outcast.\u201d Farage has this in common with other successful populists \u2013 an ability to portray himself as the outsider: little David with a fag in one hand and a pint of bitter in the other, kicking out at the all-powerful Goliath. Bolton is an ethnically diverse city; in 2011, 20% of its population did not identify as white British. Yet everybody here today appears to be white. \u201cYes, I noticed that,\u201d Johnson says, before adding that there is no tension between the city\u2019s white and Asian populations. She does not believe relationships between Bolton\u2019s Asian and European migrants are as harmonious. \u201cA lot of the Indians and Pakistanis have their own businesses and they work hard at it. But then you\u2019ve got your people from eastern Europe coming in, perhaps also wanting to set up businesses, and there are fights.\u201d \u201cToo many cultures,\u201d Parkinson says. \u201cThe eastern Europeans saw an opportunity to come over. I\u2019d do the same. It\u2019s all about survival. They\u2019re taking low-paid jobs, but the British people don\u2019t want those low-paid jobs because they\u2019ve got the benefits system to fall back on.\u201d On the bus back to Manchester, I meet Alexa Michael, a Conservative councillor for Beckenham in London. \u201cNigel says what a lot of ordinary people are thinking but are too frightened to say,\u201d she tells me. \u201cHe\u2019s got the common touch, even though he\u2019s got quite a posh background. It\u2019s no surprise that people in Bolton, the old mill towns, what you might call working-class areas, were more inclined to vote leave than some of the more prosperous areas.\u201d And yet the Bolton audience more closely resembled her \u2013 smartly dressed, very middle class \u2013 not the working-class voters we are often told Farage appeals to. *** It\u2019s a week later, and the battlebus has moved on to Birmingham\u2019s National Conference Centre. Again the event is sold out and the 1,000-strong crowd is every bit as white and grey as Bolton\u2019s. A dozen miles away, the Conservative party is holding its annual conference. \u201cI want you to make a big noise today,\u201d Longworth tells the audience, \u201cnot least because we want those people down the road to hear you.\u201d Tice takes over, to drum home the purpose of the meeting. \u201cWe know why we\u2019re here, don\u2019t we? We want to send a very simple message that they should just Chuck Chequers.\u201d Chuck Chequers; No Deal? No Problem; Leave Means Leave: the leavers have both the simplest arguments and the strongest soundbites. He makes a joke about the battlebus. \u201cWe had such fun deciding how big a number we were going to put on the bus.\u201d This is a reference to the \u00a3350m Boris Johnson emblazoned on his Vote Leave bus, the sum we were meant to be saving on EU membership and spending on the NHS every week (he had not accounted for rebates, grants and subsidies). \u201cI was all for putting \u2018Save \u00a339bn\u2019!\u201d Tice says. He pauses to let the audience laugh. \u201cUnbelievably, I was outvoted \u2013 but I believe in democracy.\u201d Thirty nine billion pounds is now the anticipated Brexit divorce bill. Conservative MP Peter Bone takes to the stage. He talks of the horror of being at the mercy of Europe. \u201cWe didn\u2019t fight world wars\u2026\u201d \u201cNo more German cars!\u201d shouts a member of the audience. \u201c\u2026 to be subservient,\u201d Bone continues. \u201cWe want to make our own laws in our own countries... The thing that annoyed people enormously was, when we make laws they\u2019re not judged by our own judges, they\u2019re not decided in our supreme court \u2013 they\u2019re decided somewhere in Europe by a bunch of judges, half of whom are not qualified anyway.\u201d \u201cNo, they aren\u2019t,\u201d cries a woman at the back. This might be Margaret Atwood\u2019s Gilead; you would fear for the safety of those European judges were they here today. Bone does a decent job of whipping up the anger, but he knows he\u2019s only the warm-up act. \u201cI think there\u2019s someone else,\u201d he says. \u201cMr Brexit!\u201d calls a voice in the crowd. \u201cNigel Farage! Mr Brexit, as somebody says at the front.\u201d Bone gets his biggest cheer, and Tice takes over for the already familiar introduction. \u201cThe vilification, abuse, threats to his family, what he\u2019s put up with is unbelievable. His courage manifested when he was unfortunately in a very serious plane crash on one election day. It would have killed many people. Bless him: he dragged himself out, wiped away the odd bit of blood, dusted himself down and promptly lit a cigarette. He is a true patriot. He is possibly the original Brexiter.\u201d Again the sea splits for Farage, and again he looks more spiv than saviour. There is a touch of Private Walker, the black-market wheeler-dealer in Dad\u2019s Army, whose absence from the regular armed forces was explained by a corned-beef allergy. \u201cGood afternoon, Birmingham,\u201d he begins. \u201cI\u2019ve given the best part of my adult life, battling, fighting, campaigning for one thing \u2013 that we, the British people, should be masters of our own destiny, running our own lives, in control of our own country. And. That. Referendum. On. June. 23rd. When. We. Won. That. Vote. Was. The. Happiest. Day. Of. My Life.\u201d Farage has an advantage over many politicians in knowing how to make his audience laugh. \u201cWe were told by the party leaders that whatever we decided they would abide by,\u201d he says. \u201cIndeed, do you remember Mr Cameron?\u201d \u201cBoooo!\u201d comes the catcall. \u201cThat\u2019s surprising, because most of the country has forgotten about him!\u201d There is laughter across the room. \u201cMr Cameron spent \u00a39m of taxpayers\u2019 money putting that outrageous leaflet through every door in the land.\u201d \u201cShame! Shame!\u201d Cameron is heckled in absentia. \u201cHow I enjoyed posting mine back through the letterbox of No 10,\u201d Farage continues, \u201cwith a few suitable annotations, but not ones I am going to share with you on a public platform.\u201d Then he\u2019s back on the attack. \u201cNow we are told that we didn\u2019t understand what we were voting for. You. Are. All. Thick. And. Pig. Ignorant. They even have the effrontery to tell us that people were lied to \u2013 despite the fact that the greatest lie of all was told back in the 1970s, when my parents\u2019 generation were told they were joining nothing more than a common market which was about friendship and free trade. Even if Boris\u2019s figures on the side of a bus were a bit on the high side, it is nothing to the half a century of lies we have been told by the establishment.\u201d Farage\u2019s argument here is straightforward. The referendum was nothing to do with the terms of leaving, and nobody thought it was; we were simply asked whether we wanted in or out. He even attempts to claim the moral high ground when it comes to the migration argument. The EU, he states, is supremacist. Why should somebody from Europe have more right to live in our country than, say, somebody from Africa or Asia? It\u2019s the only line that is not met with a resounding cheer. But by the time he is done, calling on the audience to stop the Brexit betrayal, they are chanting for more. Lynne, a friendly, middle-aged woman who has been sharing her Polos with me, is on her feet. I ask her why she feels so strongly. She talks about the need for sovereignty, to be able to make our own laws and reclaim our pride. Is it anything to do with immigration? \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cNot really.\u201d She pauses. \u201cBut Birmingham isn\u2019t as clean as it used to be. Is it? They leave their furniture in the street.\u201d Who \u2013 the Europeans? \u201cNo, the Muslims. There are areas that are predominantly Muslim. I\u2019m not racist. They\u2019re not to blame. But they don\u2019t love our country like we do. They put mattresses in the street. They all drive nice cars, mind \u2013 Mercs and BMWs. And then they\u2019ve got their rubbish piled up.\u201d She offers me another Polo. I look for Farage, but the man of the people has done a disappearing act. The last time we met, in 2009, he took me to his local pub for breakfast (three pints of Landlord), told me his political hero was Enoch Powell, and talked with pride of his German wife Kirsten and his love of a good lapdance club. But the more renowned this populist becomes, the less accessible he is; Farage declined to be interviewed for this article. Meanwhile, the less starry members of Leave Means Leave are happy to talk. I ask Peter Bone what populism means to him. \u201cDoesn\u2019t populist mean what most people want?\u201d he says. Longworth comes up with a similar definition. \u201cIt\u2019s to do with being popular among people, so if populism means we\u2019re actually supporting people\u2019s democratic rights, I\u2019m all for it.\u201d As the audience leave, I scan the hall for somebody who looks a bit younger, and spot Jared Day. He is in his 20s, and a wheelchair-user. Day is a smart, engaging man who voted remain but has since become a leaver. Why? \u201cThe EU\u2019s lack of respect. I thought the photo that Donald Tusk posted was very distasteful.\u201d Unlike many politicians, Day has no problem explaining why populism means much more than being popular. \u201cPopulism is more about nationalist lines, the nation state. When you hear about populist governments, they tend to be more internal-looking, almost isolationist.\u201d Contemporary populism is by its nature oppositional. In his 2016 book The Populist Explosion, a study of how the great recession shaped US and European politics, author John B Judis distinguishes between left- and rightwing populism as follows: \u201cLeftwing populists champion the people against an elite or an establishment. Theirs is a vertical politics of the bottom and middle, arrayed against the top. Rightwing populists champion the people against an elite that they accuse of favouring a third group, which can consist, for instance, of immigrants, Islamists, or African-American militants. Rightwing populism is triadic: it looks upward, but also down upon an out group.\u201d This feels very much the Leave Means Leave approach. On my way out, I catch two pairs of sisters chatting. Like Day, their youth makes them stand out. Jill and her sister, who does not give her name, are wearing Brexit sweatshirts, while two identical twins, who also won\u2019t give their names, are formally dressed in skirts and jackets; they could be extras for a film about the suffragette movement. Jill is a chemistry teacher from Sheffield who says she wants Brexit for her pupils. She believes there will be more money for them when we leave, and they will have a better chance of getting decent jobs. One of the twins also teaches, and is looking forward to a brighter future. All four women tell me they despise the mainstream media, particularly the Guardian, because it is a purveyor of fake news. What they dislike most is the notion that they must be ignorant or bigoted to have voted leave. The twins take up Farage\u2019s theme, finishing each other\u2019s sentences. \u201cThey demonise us\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026 And make out we\u2019re really stupid\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026 That we don\u2019t know what we voted for\u2026\u201d \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s disgusting.\u201d Jill, who is wearing union jack trainers, says: \u201cDemonise is the exact word. I so object to that. I\u2019m not far right or racist. And that, I\u2019m afraid, is the media.\u201d The women talk about wages being undercut by EU workers, how hard the trade unions have fought for the minimum wage, the need for controlled migration and to look after our own. As for the notion that British people don\u2019t want many of the jobs the Europeans do, Jill is not having any of it. \u201cAbsolute rubbish,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying the kids I teach are lazy. They\u2019re not. They want a job and can\u2019t get one, because it\u2019s been taken by somebody from the European Union.\u201d All four women sing from the same hymn sheet, despite coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum. \u201cThe main thing that got me into politics was the magnificent patriot Nigel Farage,\u201d Jill says. The twins are Corbynistas, dismayed that the Labour leader has suppressed his anti-Europe instincts. The conversation leaves my head spinning; in some ways, left and right seem an irrelevance in Brexit Britain. Perhaps that\u2019s why some Labour MPs have been happy to align themselves with Leave Means Leave. Yet look more closely and you realise that the group is not as cross-party as it would have us believe. All six members of its advisory board are white, male Conservatives. Of the 25 MPs it names as supporters on its website, 24 are Conservatives or members of the DUP. The one exception is the independent MP Kelvin Hopkins, who was suspended from the Labour party in 2017 after it was alleged he sexually harassed a local activist. (He has denied the claims.) Of the 44 prominent members pictured on Leave Means Leave\u2019s website, all are white and 43 are men; Andrea Jenkyns, the Conservative who succeeded Ed Balls as MP for Morley and Outwood, is the only woman. *** It\u2019s a Tuesday night in October and we\u2019re in Bournemouth, which voted to leave Europe by a margin of 9%. Like the other events, tonight\u2019s rally is sold out. Before the speakers start, the audience is shown a film about how intransigent the EU has been in negotiating Brexit. The narrator asks: \u201cWhen we asked for cooperation on security, the boys in Brussels said Non! When Mrs May offered flexibility on Labour mobility, the boys in Brussels said Non! Mrs May even offered them more of our money, and this time the boys in Brussels said they wanted more! The UK has consistently offered the boys in Brussels huge concessions yet it is never enough for these unaccountable Eurocrats who, let\u2019s remember, spend an awful lot of their time\u2026 drunk.\u201d On the screen, a cartoon inebriated Eurocrat topples over, and the crowd cheer. Alcohol is a recurring theme tonight. JD Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin was due to make an appearance, but he has gone down with a tummy bug, so we are played a video of him addressing a rally in Torquay the previous week instead. \u201cLord Bamford, Sir James Dyson, Tim Martin\u2026 have you noticed how all the great entrepreneurs are Brexiters?\u201d John Longworth says. \u201cTim set up a chain of almost 1,000 pubs.\u201d \u201cAnd Nigel\u2019s drunk in most of them!\u201d heckles a man in front of me affectionately. Tice has perfected his introduction over the past month. \u201cHe is possibly the original, truest Brexiteer!\u201d he begins. \u201cHe should be prime minister!\u201d cries a voice from the front. Tice tells the story of Farage\u2019s helicopter crash, this time leaving a gap for the audience to applaud each heroic act. \u201cIt would have killed many people, but not our good friend. He dragged himself out of the plane, wiped away the blood from his head, from his eyes, dusted himself down\u2026 \u201d \u201cHoorah!\u201d \u201cPut his hand in his pocket... \u201d \u201cHoorah!\u201d \u201cReached out for a packet of cigarettes and lit a fag.\u201d \u201cHoooooorraaaaah!\u201d Farage begins with a humblebrag. \u201cGood evening, Bournemouth. I\u2019m going to take issue with the deputy chair\u2019s introduction. I\u2019m not the original Brexiteer. That was Henry VIII.\u201d He appears to be in a jovial mood. \u201cMy day started when I got off the battlebus in Christchurch. I went round Christchurch market, and I met some stallholders and members of the public, and then it all went wrong.\u201d Pause. \u201cWe found a pub.\u201d This is Farage the seaside standup, and the audience lap it up. \u201cThe day after the referendum, there was an emergency debate in the European parliament. I thought I\u2019d better show up, you know, \u2019cos I\u2019ve worked quite hard over there. I\u2019ve always tried to make positive and helpful contributions. And there waiting for me was European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, who came up, put an arm round me, and said\u2026 \u2018Bastard!\u2019\u201d The hall erupts. Then Farage flips the mood. \u201cI said to them, \u2018That morning when I came here, 17 years ago, I said I would lead a campaign to take the United Kingdom out of the European Union, and you laughed at me. Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018you\u2019re not laughing now, are you?\u2019\u201d And suddenly Farage flips again; now he\u2019s mobilising his troops. \u201cThis is the most important campaign that has ever been fought in British history. This. Campaign. Is. About. Right. And. Wrong. We are simply asking our politicians to do what they promised.\u201d There was a time, he says, when he trusted May when she said that no deal was better than a bad deal. \u201cShe kept on telling us Brexit means Brexit, but little did we know that she is a woman who is too weak to negotiate with the European commission.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI\u2019d much rather we sent someone like Trump, personally!\u201d The audience applauds. Now it\u2019s time for strategy, as Farage tells supporters how to confront MPs. \u201cI don\u2019t want you writing letters to them. Go and visit them at their surgeries, queue around the block, meet them face to face, make them feel the heat, make them understand that being part of a customs union, being a vassal state with laws made somewhere else, is unacceptable. And that if they do this, you will never give them your vote again. Make. Them. Feel. The. Heat. We in Leave Means Leave are reactivating the people\u2019s army.\u201d The language is tough and militaristic, and Farage\u2019s delivery chilling. He warns that if he is forced to fight a second referendum we\u2019ll see a very different Farage: \u201cThis time, no more Mr Nice Guy.\u201d I can\u2019t help thinking back to his victory speech after the referendum, delivered at 4am on 24 June 2016. Farage boasted that Brexit had been achieved \u201cwithout a single bullet being fired\u201d. It was only eight days after the strongly pro-EU Labour MP Jo Cox had been murdered on her way to a constituency surgery. Her killer, Thomas Mair, shouted \u201cKeep Britain independent\u201dand \u201cBritain first\u201d as he shot and stabbed her. But Farage appeared to have forgotten that. *** On 13 November, Theresa May announces that the UK and the European Union have reached an agreement; the next day the Cabinet signs off on the deal. Leave Means Leave organises a protest outside Downing Street. On 15 November, Brexit secretary Dominic Raab is one of four ministers to resign amid calls for the prime minister to step down. Britain remains gridlocked; Westminster is in chaos and yet nothing changes. On 10 December, the day before the Commons is due to have its say on the deal, May announces the vote will be delayed. The following day Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee, announces that the threshold has been reached for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister; at least 48 letters have been submitted by Tory MPs. Although May survives, winning by 200 votes to 117, she appears to have as little chance of getting her deal through the Commons as she did before. Meanwhile, there is a similar upheaval in Farage\u2019s world \u2013 revolution leading to stasis. On 22 November, Ukip leader Gerard Batten announces that he has appointed far-right activist and former EDL leader Tommy Robinson as a special adviser on \u201crape gangs\u201d and prison reform. In an interview on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Farage says he is \u201cappalled\u201d, that Ukip is becoming a party of \u201cstreet activism\u201d, and that Batten has sabotaged his own efforts to make Ukip \u201ca non-racist, non-sectarian party\u201d. This is the same Farage who masterminded the Breaking Point poster; the same Farage who talked only days ago about mobilising a people\u2019s army. On 4 December, he announces that he is quitting Ukip \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d: he has lost his battle to \u201cprofessionalise\u201d the party he helped found in 1993. But the truth is, he has outgrown Ukip. Its once marginal voice is now mainstream, and Farage has bigger political fish to fry. *** It is 14 December, and all the big guns are out for the Leave Means Leave rally at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre, opposite the Houses of Parliament. Jacob Rees-Mogg, JD Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin, the DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson and, of course, Farage, line up to deliver the same message \u2013 No Deal? No Problem \u2013 only with more urgency. There is a new chant: \u201cLet\u2019s go bigger than Europe. Let\u2019s go Global. Let\u2019s Go WTO.\u201d Inconsistency appears to be a virtue for this populist campaign; globalism is now presented as a positive rather than a negative. Tonight, the two Labour MPs who have spoken at previous rallies, Kate Hoey and Graham Stringer, are on the same bill, giving the event a more genuinely cross-party feel. But there is nothing diverse about the audience, and the whiteness is, if anything, even more stark than at previous rallies \u2013 not least because nearly every security officer on the door is black. This is the first rally held in the heart of remain-land \u2013 London \u2013 and the mood is darker, more defiant. There is a sense of the battle lines hardening: only two days ago, chancellor Philip Hammond described hard Brexiters as \u201cextremists\u201d. Tonight, all six speakers have the knack of being able to incite the crowd or make them laugh \u2013 even the antediluvian Rees-Mogg, dubbed the honourable member for the 18th century. Hoey asks how we can trust the government to take us out of the EU when it is led by a prime minister who is a remainer, a chancellor who regards Brexiters as extremists and a Speaker \u201cwho has a Bollocks to Brexit sticker on his car\u201d. Tim Martin concludes his speech by quoting Paul Simon (\u201cYou just slip out the back, Jack/Make a new plan, Stan/You don\u2019t need to be coy, Roy/Just get yourself free\u201d). Puce-faced Sammy Wilson delivers a barnstorming unionist speech (\u201cThe EU is demanding the price for leaving is splitting the United Kingdom. Never!\u201d) and says that not even Arthur Daley would have had the brass to flog the Chequers deal to the British public. As always, though, Farage is the star turn. He makes the familiar jokes about booze, dismisses the \u201cjumped-up foreign bureaucrats\u201d of Brussels, and describes the Italian government (which has scrapped humanitarian protection status for asylum seekers) as \u201crather splendid\u201d. But this is a more muted, restrained Farage. He admits he is worried. \u201cI\u2019m afraid, folks, I don\u2019t see the great Brexit betrayal as anywhere near finished. I\u2019m now more fearful than at any time I have been during this process that, outrageous and monstrous though it is, we\u2019re going to finish up being sent back for a second referendum\u2026 My message, folks, is it would be wrong of us not to get ready, not to prepare for the worst-case scenario\u2026 Let us be ready not just to fight back, not just to be ready for that referendum, but if it comes we\u2019ll win it next time. By. A. Much. Bigger. Majority.\u201d Back in January 2018, Farage surprised everyone by calling for a second referendum, on the grounds it would deliver a bigger leave majority. But it was a classic Farage blip, and he has never called for one since. Last August, he dismissed the idea as \u201cnot the people\u2019s vote, but the George Soros vote\u201d. After his speech in London, Farage is mobbed. A huddle forms around him, comprised mainly of the few young people in the audience. A woman in her 20s, draped in a union jack, asks for a selfie. Her friend, also draped in a union jack, pushes her way forward. \u201cExcuse me, seeing as I got her these tickets, the least you can do is give me a kiss,\u201d she says to Farage. This is the closest I\u2019ve been to him in three months of following the Leave Means Leave campaign \u2013 within shouting distance. So I do just that. Earlier this evening, someone in the audience asked who people should vote for, now that Farage has quit Ukip. The question went unanswered, so I ask again. \u201cNigel, who should we vote for?\u201d \u201cWho asked that?\u201d he says. \u201cI asked that,\u201d I bellow, deep within the bosom of the Faragistas. He looks at me. \u201cWell, let\u2019s find out, shall we? At the moment I couldn\u2019t vote for anybody. But let\u2019s see how this plays out. The cards haven\u2019t fallen yet. I meant what I said tonight. All the Eurosceptics are hoping we\u2019re going to get through this, but I\u2019m actually more pessimistic.\u201d Do we need to mobilise? \u201cYes. When you build an army, you don\u2019t do it wanting to fight a war. But if a war happens, you\u2019ve got it. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve now got to do.\u201d And with that he\u2019s off, flanked by two security men. I shout one of his own slogans after him as he walks away. \u201cNigel, no more Mr Nice Guy?\u201d He turns on his heels, walks back and looks me in the face. For once there isn\u2019t a hint of a smile. \u201cOh listen. Listen. If they make us do this again, I shall be a bit tougher than last time.\u201d \u2022 This article forms part of the Guardian\u2019s ongoing series, The new populism; read more here.

      "body": "<p>In a review into the Metropolitan police service\u2019s secretive Gangs Matrix, the London mayor\u2019s office has been forced to publicly acknowledge that the database disproportionately targets black males. \u201cThe representation of young black males on the matrix is disproportionate to their likelihood of criminality and victimisation,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/21/metropolitan-police-gangs-matrix-review-london-mayor-discriminatory\" title=\"\">the report, sneaked out just before Christmas, admitted</a>.</p> <p>Of the almost 4,000 names on the matrix at any given time, 78% are black and 9% are other ethnic minorities. Yet the review made no attempts to explain why this shocking disproportionality exists; nor did it seek to understand, or explain, the impact of this racist policing process on the individuals targeted, their families or the communities that they come from.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/21/metropolitan-police-gangs-matrix-review-london-mayor-discriminatory\">Met gangs matrix may be discriminatory, review finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a result of a number of leaks of the sensitive information the database holds, there have been several damning reports into its use. The Monitoring Group, Amnesty International and StopWatch have all cited the matrix as racial profiling, discriminatory and an ineffective tool. But probably the most damning verdict comes from the information commissioner\u2019s office. It carried out a 12-month investigation into the legality of the gang matrix\u2019s processes. It found that the Met\u2019s use of the matrix has led to multiple and serious breaches of data protection, privacy and equality laws \u201cwith the potential to cause damage and distress to the disproportionate number of black men on the matrix\u201d. As a result the Met <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/action-weve-taken/enforcement/metropolitan-police-service/\" title=\"\">is now effectively under \u201cspecial measures</a>\u201d. </p> <p>So there now appears to be a slowly growing recognition, even among the regulators, that the matrix is, and has been used as, a discriminatory tool in the Met\u2019s so-called war on gangs.</p> <p>Yet it is little understood how the matrix itself helps to fuel the violence it was set up to stop. The Met claims the matrix, informed by intelligence, helps identify and assess the most harmful gang members in each of London\u2019s boroughs, based on violence and weapon offences.</p> <p>But, those of us who have witnessed the impact of the matrix know this is far from the truth. Individuals are classified \u2013 given a computer-generated harm rating of red, amber or green, meant to reflect the risk an individual poses to others. Yet 65% of those on the matrix are rated, by the Met itself, as green, which means they are officially deemed low-risk. In fact, 40% of these individuals have no record of violence; and 27% of these same greens have no criminal record whatsoever. They populate the list simply because they are the friends or acquaintances of those on the matrix who might resort to the use of violence. The regulators agree that their inclusion on the database is unjustifiable, and now the Mayor\u2019s Office for Policing and Crime has demanded that the Met reconsider their inclusion.</p> <p>But what should be of most concern to black people in the capital is that the matrix has a significant and, according to the information commissioner, \u201cintended impact on the rest of the public sector\u201d, through the sharing of sensitive, untested information. In effect the entire public sector \u2013 including local authorities, housing associations and jobcentres \u2013 has become critical partners with the Met in this process, with chilling effects on the life chances, as there is little differentiation by the public servants whom the information is shared with between those of \u201chigh risk\u201d and those who are greens. </p> <p>So GM \u201cnominals\u201d are policed not simply by Met officers but by the state, in the most oppressive manner possible. Children get excluded from schools; young people receive benefits sanctions and miss out on offers of employment or training; families are denied housing transfers; local youth provision is removed.</p> <p>In Haringey, north London, the Met engaged with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority, which has written to nearly all the borough\u2019s 100 \u201cgang nominals\u201d telling them they are suspected cannabis smokers, and therefore have to either complete a \u201cmedical\u201d (including providing a urine sample) or return their driving licence. The anger and frustration this creates among its young targets is what risks fuelling violence. Everyone knows that kids who are bullied can often become bullies themselves. And the overzealous focus on gangs by the Met has, in all probability, left fewer resources to deal with the real issues underlying the violence on the capital\u2019s streets. So the matrix is not only an institutionally racist process, but it is also wholly ineffective.</p> <p>In its review, the mayor\u2019s office recommends that it and the Met engage with the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). But this is not a mere bureaucratic error in failing to comply with equality obligations: this is institutionally racist policing in its purest form. The EHRC itself must now use its powers and conduct a full investigation, not only into the Met\u2019s use of such a racist process but into police forces in Manchester, Birmingham and Nottingham, where such lists are also in use. </p> <p>\u2022 Stafford Scott was a co-founder of the Broadwater Farm Defence Campaign in 1985, and is now a consultant on racial equality and community engagement</p>",

      "bodyText": "In a review into the Metropolitan police service\u2019s secretive Gangs Matrix, the London mayor\u2019s office has been forced to publicly acknowledge that the database disproportionately targets black males. \u201cThe representation of young black males on the matrix is disproportionate to their likelihood of criminality and victimisation,\u201d the report, sneaked out just before Christmas, admitted. Of the almost 4,000 names on the matrix at any given time, 78% are black and 9% are other ethnic minorities. Yet the review made no attempts to explain why this shocking disproportionality exists; nor did it seek to understand, or explain, the impact of this racist policing process on the individuals targeted, their families or the communities that they come from. As a result of a number of leaks of the sensitive information the database holds, there have been several damning reports into its use. The Monitoring Group, Amnesty International and StopWatch have all cited the matrix as racial profiling, discriminatory and an ineffective tool. But probably the most damning verdict comes from the information commissioner\u2019s office. It carried out a 12-month investigation into the legality of the gang matrix\u2019s processes. It found that the Met\u2019s use of the matrix has led to multiple and serious breaches of data protection, privacy and equality laws \u201cwith the potential to cause damage and distress to the disproportionate number of black men on the matrix\u201d. As a result the Met is now effectively under \u201cspecial measures\u201d. So there now appears to be a slowly growing recognition, even among the regulators, that the matrix is, and has been used as, a discriminatory tool in the Met\u2019s so-called war on gangs. Yet it is little understood how the matrix itself helps to fuel the violence it was set up to stop. The Met claims the matrix, informed by intelligence, helps identify and assess the most harmful gang members in each of London\u2019s boroughs, based on violence and weapon offences. But, those of us who have witnessed the impact of the matrix know this is far from the truth. Individuals are classified \u2013 given a computer-generated harm rating of red, amber or green, meant to reflect the risk an individual poses to others. Yet 65% of those on the matrix are rated, by the Met itself, as green, which means they are officially deemed low-risk. In fact, 40% of these individuals have no record of violence; and 27% of these same greens have no criminal record whatsoever. They populate the list simply because they are the friends or acquaintances of those on the matrix who might resort to the use of violence. The regulators agree that their inclusion on the database is unjustifiable, and now the Mayor\u2019s Office for Policing and Crime has demanded that the Met reconsider their inclusion. But what should be of most concern to black people in the capital is that the matrix has a significant and, according to the information commissioner, \u201cintended impact on the rest of the public sector\u201d, through the sharing of sensitive, untested information. In effect the entire public sector \u2013 including local authorities, housing associations and jobcentres \u2013 has become critical partners with the Met in this process, with chilling effects on the life chances, as there is little differentiation by the public servants whom the information is shared with between those of \u201chigh risk\u201d and those who are greens. So GM \u201cnominals\u201d are policed not simply by Met officers but by the state, in the most oppressive manner possible. Children get excluded from schools; young people receive benefits sanctions and miss out on offers of employment or training; families are denied housing transfers; local youth provision is removed. In Haringey, north London, the Met engaged with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority, which has written to nearly all the borough\u2019s 100 \u201cgang nominals\u201d telling them they are suspected cannabis smokers, and therefore have to either complete a \u201cmedical\u201d (including providing a urine sample) or return their driving licence. The anger and frustration this creates among its young targets is what risks fuelling violence. Everyone knows that kids who are bullied can often become bullies themselves. And the overzealous focus on gangs by the Met has, in all probability, left fewer resources to deal with the real issues underlying the violence on the capital\u2019s streets. So the matrix is not only an institutionally racist process, but it is also wholly ineffective. In its review, the mayor\u2019s office recommends that it and the Met engage with the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). But this is not a mere bureaucratic error in failing to comply with equality obligations: this is institutionally racist policing in its purest form. The EHRC itself must now use its powers and conduct a full investigation, not only into the Met\u2019s use of such a racist process but into police forces in Manchester, Birmingham and Nottingham, where such lists are also in use. \u2022 Stafford Scott was a co-founder of the Broadwater Farm Defence Campaign in 1985, and is now a consultant on racial equality and community engagement",

Ticket-holders ranged from VIPs and those who had forked out $5,000 to winners of a lottery that offers 275 tickets for every performance at $10 each. Liz Mari, 30, an optician, had wanted a Hamilton ticket for her 30th birthday on Thursday. Her husband tried and failed, but then they got lucky in the lottery. \u201cI wanted to cry,\u201d she said of the moment she found out. \u201cWe\u2019ve been to New York to try and see it and couldn\u2019t get a ticket, so to see it now on our island is amazing. This is the first time we can actually see a Broadway show in Puerto Rico.\u201d Doris Pellicier, 61, a bank manager, was similarly euphoric: \u201cI called my husband: \u2018Wow! Wow! I won, I can\u2019t believe it!\u2019\u201d Her husband, Eric Perez, 65, a vice-president of a hospital group, added: \u201cWe wanted to see it because it\u2019s a great musical and Lin-Manuel Miranda is Puerto Rican. People here are very proud of what he\u2019s done.\u201d Another audience member, Kari Hernandez, 32, admitted: \u201cI\u2019ve never been happier in my life than at this moment! It is super-inspiring to see this here in this environment and at this time. It feels a little bit extra special: a lot of the messaging resonates. Puerto Rico is struggling in a lot of ways and it\u2019s a good time for inspiration.\u201d A British Hamilton fan was in attendance, too. Matthew Lumby, 46, a civil servant from Islington, north London, had seen the show six times already but paid $300 for a ticket plus air fare. \u201cI saw Lin-Manuel Miranda do it in the early days on Broadway,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d get the chance again. He brings his own idiosyncrasies to the role; he does his own little dances. It\u2019s funny to see him deliver the words he wrote. He can do it like no one else.\u201d At an after-show party, where musicians played and the Hamilton logo was combined with the Puerto Rican flag on a giant screen, Miranda was trailed by an eager crowd snapping photos on their phones. He climbed on stage and said: \u201cMy heart is so full. It is not every day you get to bring everyone you love to the island you most love in the world.\u201d",

On a night off last week Rib\u00e9ry travelled to Dubai for dinner at Nusr-Et, a restaurant run by celebrity butcher Nusret Gokce \u2013 also known as Salt Bae in tribute to his \u201ciconic\u201d method of sprinkling seasoning on meat.</p> <p>Rib\u00e9ry ate a Tomahawk steak covered in gold dust. We know this because he published a film on Instagram that shows the vast chop being plonked in front of him, gleaming like a prime cut of Aslan-shank. Salt Bae is in shot too, sunglasses on, dressed in his muscle-shirt butcher\u2019s tunic. On cue he drops into an urgent, constipated crouch and begins to slice the Tomahawk, revolving his hands in a series of sensual gestures, gyrating his hips, a man not so much carving meat as energetically feeling it up in the VIP section of an elite celebrity disco.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FranckRibery/status/1080754426292457473\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">No better way to start the year than with a dash of salt and a visit to my Turkish brother \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SaltBae?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SaltBae</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/fr7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#fr7</a>\ud83d\udc51 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELHAMDOULILLAH?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ELHAMDOULILLAH</a>\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffd\u2665\ufe0f <a href=\"https://t.co/O5ztj4mueq\">pic.twitter.com/O5ztj4mueq</a></p>&mdash; Franck Rib\u00e9ry (@FranckRibery) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FranckRibery/status/1080754426292457473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 3, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>On this occasion Rib\u00e9ry himself is allowed to perform the ritual of the sprinkling, as Salt Bae crowds close by in voyeuristic approval before finally planting his quivering meat-scimitar into the steak board with a flick of the wrist. Smiles all round and gangster fingers into the camera. And that\u2019s a scene.</p> <p>At which point, the whole thing pretty much fell apart. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the jealous, the haters, those only born because a condom had a hole in: fuck your mothers, your grandmothers and even your family tree,\u201d Rib\u00e9ry posted on his social media page at the start of this week, response to a great spurting geyser of personal abuse over his choice of venue, style of steak, lifestyle, religion, and basic extinction as a unit of extreme consumption within the nexus of professional sport.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rib\u00e9ry has since been hit with a \u201csubstantial\u201d fine by Bayern for his reaction. Wider reporting of the incident has created a vague, semi-processed picture of just another footballing imbecile waving his underserved millions in the face of consumptive nurses everywhere.</p> <p>As an anatomy of idiocy on so many levels it is a fairly complete picture, from the inanity of the original tableau, to the confected outrage, to the undeniable weirdness of the basic spectacle.</p> <p>The first thing to say is, of course, lay off Franck. Overseasoned, overpriced cuts of gold-leaf meat exist because there are sufficient people in the world willing to buy them (Rib\u00e9ry\u2019s, incidentally, was a gift). Robert Lewandowski did the same thing a few days earlier, producing his own video with Salt Bae frowning down at his meat as though solving some deep maths algorithm, salt bearer offering up his platter as though presenting his own quivering ohmic soul to those gloved fingers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/09/benjamin-pavard-bayern-munich-join-summer\">Benjamin Pavard to join Bayern Munich in summer for \u00a331.4m</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nobody seemed to care much on that occasion, but then Lewandowski looks like a super-Aryan James Bond rejected from auditions for the next super-Aryan James Bond for looking too much like a super-Aryan James Bond. He isn\u2019t from the Chemin-Vert sink estate in Boulogne, isn\u2019t a Muslim convert, doesn\u2019t wear street-style fashions, isn\u2019t a convenient pi\u00f1ata for all the rage, the confused material longing that the wider digital public like to hurl at the right kind of footballer on such occasions.</p> <p>And really if Rib\u00e9ry\u2019s gold steak tells us anything it is that the key relationship between those who play and those who watch has become fundamentally skewed and toxic. Star footballers tend to be either venerated with a sickly and sensual kind of piety, or relentlessly abused as a cartoon embodiment of all human failings. All of which is justified on the grounds that they\u2019re rich and therefore impossibly blessed, immune to all human anguish, an attitude that says a great deal more about the craven, depressingly deluded veneration of money and celebrity generally.</p> <p>Alienation, anger, loss of that shared human touch: this is of course just another casualty of football\u2019s decision to turn itself inside out in the name of money, just another gold-leaf chop to be carved apart on the salted board.</p> <p>Bayern\u2019s presence in Qatar is in itself a cause of some discomfort to the fan base. But then money has done such strange things to this dear old sport, created a peculiar drowned world where you fall at the first hurdle just trying to find the correct moral response, from the political hijacking of the world\u2019s favourite spectacle to the fact any person anywhere can be paid a million pounds a month. Hate the gold-leaf butchery. Hate the grabbing hands at the edges of the game. But don\u2019t hate the player.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In his book This One\u2019s On Me Jimmy Greaves describes the pre-match meals of his playing days in the 1960s. At West Ham it was all down to Moody\u2019s cafe for a full roast dinner and apple crumble for pudding. As an England player Greaves records, with some reverence, the pre-match habits of Gordon Banks, who in line with the sports science of the day would prepare himself for a game with a huge steak served with both boiled and roast potatoes, all washed down with \u201ca large bowl of rice pudding\u201d. Looking back now it is probably a good thing social media wasn\u2019t around in the mid-60s. It isn\u2019t hard to imagine the wider response to such wanton displays of starch-based excess. Banks Flaunts Roast Riches. Soccer Ace in Boiled AND Roasted Shame. Potato Bae: Gloveman Rocked By Double-Spud storm. But then, there has always been an obsession with footballers\u2019 consumption, from the days of Scampi dinners and Ford Cortinas, to the obsession with Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s \u00a32.5m Bugatti, Raheem Sterling\u2019s kitchen sink, Neymar\u2019s fur-lined helicopter gunship, his emerald-studded rocket-unicycle, his ocean-going sex yacht powered entirely by the tears of Martian slaves. In the last few days it has been the turn of Franck Rib\u00e9ry, who has spent the last few days on a winter sun training camp in Qatar with Bayern Munich. On a night off last week Rib\u00e9ry travelled to Dubai for dinner at Nusr-Et, a restaurant run by celebrity butcher Nusret Gokce \u2013 also known as Salt Bae in tribute to his \u201ciconic\u201d method of sprinkling seasoning on meat. Rib\u00e9ry ate a Tomahawk steak covered in gold dust. We know this because he published a film on Instagram that shows the vast chop being plonked in front of him, gleaming like a prime cut of Aslan-shank. Salt Bae is in shot too, sunglasses on, dressed in his muscle-shirt butcher\u2019s tunic. On cue he drops into an urgent, constipated crouch and begins to slice the Tomahawk, revolving his hands in a series of sensual gestures, gyrating his hips, a man not so much carving meat as energetically feeling it up in the VIP section of an elite celebrity disco. On this occasion Rib\u00e9ry himself is allowed to perform the ritual of the sprinkling, as Salt Bae crowds close by in voyeuristic approval before finally planting his quivering meat-scimitar into the steak board with a flick of the wrist. Smiles all round and gangster fingers into the camera. And that\u2019s a scene. At which point, the whole thing pretty much fell apart. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the jealous, the haters, those only born because a condom had a hole in: fuck your mothers, your grandmothers and even your family tree,\u201d Rib\u00e9ry posted on his social media page at the start of this week, response to a great spurting geyser of personal abuse over his choice of venue, style of steak, lifestyle, religion, and basic extinction as a unit of extreme consumption within the nexus of professional sport. Rib\u00e9ry has since been hit with a \u201csubstantial\u201d fine by Bayern for his reaction. Wider reporting of the incident has created a vague, semi-processed picture of just another footballing imbecile waving his underserved millions in the face of consumptive nurses everywhere. As an anatomy of idiocy on so many levels it is a fairly complete picture, from the inanity of the original tableau, to the confected outrage, to the undeniable weirdness of the basic spectacle. The first thing to say is, of course, lay off Franck. Overseasoned, overpriced cuts of gold-leaf meat exist because there are sufficient people in the world willing to buy them (Rib\u00e9ry\u2019s, incidentally, was a gift). Robert Lewandowski did the same thing a few days earlier, producing his own video with Salt Bae frowning down at his meat as though solving some deep maths algorithm, salt bearer offering up his platter as though presenting his own quivering ohmic soul to those gloved fingers. Nobody seemed to care much on that occasion, but then Lewandowski looks like a super-Aryan James Bond rejected from auditions for the next super-Aryan James Bond for looking too much like a super-Aryan James Bond. He isn\u2019t from the Chemin-Vert sink estate in Boulogne, isn\u2019t a Muslim convert, doesn\u2019t wear street-style fashions, isn\u2019t a convenient pi\u00f1ata for all the rage, the confused material longing that the wider digital public like to hurl at the right kind of footballer on such occasions. And really if Rib\u00e9ry\u2019s gold steak tells us anything it is that the key relationship between those who play and those who watch has become fundamentally skewed and toxic. Star footballers tend to be either venerated with a sickly and sensual kind of piety, or relentlessly abused as a cartoon embodiment of all human failings. All of which is justified on the grounds that they\u2019re rich and therefore impossibly blessed, immune to all human anguish, an attitude that says a great deal more about the craven, depressingly deluded veneration of money and celebrity generally. Alienation, anger, loss of that shared human touch: this is of course just another casualty of football\u2019s decision to turn itself inside out in the name of money, just another gold-leaf chop to be carved apart on the salted board. Bayern\u2019s presence in Qatar is in itself a cause of some discomfort to the fan base. But then money has done such strange things to this dear old sport, created a peculiar drowned world where you fall at the first hurdle just trying to find the correct moral response, from the political hijacking of the world\u2019s favourite spectacle to the fact any person anywhere can be paid a million pounds a month. Hate the gold-leaf butchery. Hate the grabbing hands at the edges of the game. But don\u2019t hate the player.",

      "body": "<p><strong>How did you start writing about food?</strong></p> <p>My first review was in about 1998 for Marie Claire magazine. The restaurant is still there and I loved it. I wanted to write about food and have a column from that point but they\u2019re not the kind of jobs you come across easily. You have to pretty much wait for someone to die or give up because they\u2019ve got gout. People carry on as long as they can because it\u2019s the greatest job in the world. Before I started reviewing for the London Evening Standard in 2012, I spent years wanting to be a critic so that I could purge all the things in my head about bad restaurants and good restaurants, but mainly bad ones.</p> <p><strong>Do you eat out every night?</strong></p> <p>No. I tend to hit restaurants in batches over two to three days, and eat and take notes. Last night, I was at a place in north London. Today, I\u2019m going to write my column about a restaurant in Edinburgh, then go to one in Covent Garden and a brasserie in the West End. I have a space where I really eat and then I try to counteract it by living really cleanly for, say, 48 hours, 72 hours. It\u2019s the only way that works for me. During the down period, I exercise a lot and I live, try to be as good as I can.</p> <p>In London alone, there are about 230 openings a year and I am invited to all of them. If I wanted to go and eat the food there for free, I could although that\u2019s an ethical problem. I book anonymously everywhere I go, which is hard because they find out the names all the time, I pay for the meal myself then claim it back from the Guardian. I spend as much as an average person would at dinner - I don\u2019t go mad. It\u2019s a normal experience, so far as it can be. You have to be really strategic in eating as a critic because your body doesn\u2019t really belong to you any more: it belongs to the newspaper. You\u2019ve got to get the food into you at some time to write the column but if you were to eat everything that came your way, it would be the end of you.</p> <p><strong>Is it impossible to eat without mentally reviewing the food?</strong></p> <p>Yes. It\u2019s impossible even when I\u2019m really trying. My mind is always subconsciously trying to work out why this food isn\u2019t up to standard. Is it stale? Has it been made without love and without the right seasoning? And why is a restaurant not staffed properly? It takes over your life so I enjoy eating at home because there\u2019s a calmness about that.</p> <p>I took my mother for afternoon tea at a hotel in the Lake District the other day and I just wanted to treat her to a lovely experience but I was writing a furious column in my head from the moment we walked in. The greeting, the lack of greeting, the general atmosphere from the staff, that they\u2019re bored to see me and so on.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to go out eating with me socially because once I\u2019ve noticed things, my antennae are on. My friends never cook for me. When they\u2019re tipsy, they invite me to dinner then, in the cold light of day, they panic and always book a restaurant. I\u2019m rarely ever invited to people\u2019s houses to eat. It\u2019s a lovely idea until they wake up then they wriggle out of it.</p> <p><strong>What have been your best dinners?</strong></p> <p>I always remember the bad experiences because I have hundreds of great dinners. I once went on a hot date with a hot actor to what was one of London\u2019s hottest restaurants and once we\u2019d ordered he announced that he was actually seeing someone else but of course then I couldn\u2019t stand up and leave. I had to eat about seven courses of incredible world-class Indian food through absolute gritted teeth. And I remember thinking there are thousands of people across London who would kill for this bespoke naan and I am bloody going to eat it.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re pretty much vegan. How does that affect your reviewing?</strong></p> <p>When I was a little girl I always enjoyed the roast potatoes and the vegetables at Sunday dinner more than the meat. I was always incredibly aware what meat is. I\u2019m a massive animal lover so the glorification of meat doesn\u2019t sit right with me. I don\u2019t get upset if people eat it around me. When I\u2019m reviewing, I always have someone with me who eats meat. I don\u2019t generally ever order meat; they always do. I will have a bit of theirs and I can tell straightaway if it\u2019s good or rubbish. I don\u2019t have to force myself \u2013 I\u2019m not gagging when I eat it - because I don\u2019t think meat tastes horrible. One of the cruellest tricks is how absolutely delicious lamb is. In my own time, I eat vegan or vegetarian. I really abhor factory farming and its byproducts so I live a vegan lifestyle as much as I can. If you come to my house you are getting oat milk, vegan cheeses and things like that. I am always walking into restaurants and making them paranoid that they are not catering to people of different appetites and I think that I am a force for good in that way.</p> <p><strong>What would be your desert island dish?</strong></p> <p>It would be something carb-laden and full of calories because I\u2019m going to finally put on as much weight as I\u2019d like to if I wasn\u2019t on HDTV in people\u2019s living rooms. It would be chef Romy Gill\u2019s samosa chaat \u2013 fried, chopped-up samosas with chickpeas, sweet chutneys and yoghurt. It\u2019s a big, crunchy, chunky bowl. It\u2019s delicious. She would just keep bringing me that.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the most important thing you try to convey in reviews?</strong></p> <p>Is the restaurant worth going to? That\u2019s it for me. I\u2019m not writing for a small number of London food-scene tastemakers. I write my Guardian column for people all over Britain who may go out two or three times a year because they have families and a limited budget, and I want that experience to be amazing for them and not a rip-off. I write for people who are looking for places to take their spouse for an anniversary or somewhere to propose or somewhere to save their relationship. I also want to convey what restaurants are like for people who may never get to go to them. I think those people want to know what it feels like to be in there. The food world is very funny \u2013 unintentionally often \u2013 and I want to make people laugh or cheer them up every Saturday morning.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the best thing about your job?</strong></p> <p>When I review a rural pub, say, outside London for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/series/grace-dent-on-restaurants\">Feast</a>, then I hear that they have been booked out for months ahead and they\u2019ve had to take on more staff from the local area. You realise that you\u2019ve really made an impact on that community and you can change people\u2019s lives. It feels amazing but you\u2019ve got a massive responsibility sometimes.</p> <p><strong>Are you ever wrong?</strong></p> <p>Looking back at reviews I sometimes know that I was in an incredibly bad mood and taking my horrible day with me, so the fact that the service and the food were terrible meant that I was probably harsher than I could have been. However, was I wrong? No, you\u2019re never wrong. I don\u2019t make up that things are bad. When I\u2019ve given a stinking review, it\u2019s because those things happened. I don\u2019t look back at any place that I have annihilated and go, actually now I think about it, that was a wonderful meal.</p> <p><strong>How do you think of the restaurants around Britain?</strong></p> <p>Before Feast, when I wrote about restaurants at the London Evening Standard for five years, I definitely became convinced that the only good food in Britain was in the capital. When I came to the Guardian, I was determined to spend half my time going right through Britain, to prove myself wrong and to take up the advice of readers and of people that I met along the way. After my first year, I admit I was a complete idiot to think there wasn\u2019t great food outside London. It does new and trend-setting but there are incredible places across the country. My greatest meals in 2018 have been in places like Moseley, Edinburgh and the Lake District. One of my favourite places to be at the moment is Bristol and I love Manchester - it\u2019s really exciting.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of food crazes?</strong></p> <p>Food fads are the bane of the critic\u2019s life because you\u2019re served the same thing again and again. Food predictions are arbitrary things that people have decided will be cool next year, like some super seed is in and another one is out. They\u2019re just ridiculous. But as a writer who likes to make people laugh, they\u2019re an absolute gift.</p> <p>A food trend I\u2019d like to see the back of is the never-ending tasting menu. I looked at the menu of a restaurant near Brighton recently and they do a 19-course tasting menu for \u00a3180 or something. I think there may be a 14-course one if you beg for clemency. It said that to enjoy the full experience please allow three to four hours for dinner, we seat everyone at 7 but meet us at 6 o\u2019clock at the bar for a drink. I\u2019ve had relationships that haven\u2019t lasted as long as that. You\u2019re literally moving in with all your fellow diners and the staff for an entire evening. No.</p> <p><br></p>",

Meanwhile, other dark developments \u2013 from the erosion of American democracy and the resurgence of the European <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/far-right\" title=\"\">far right</a>, all the way to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\" title=\"\">climate change</a> \u2013 fuel a sense of foreboding that isn\u2019t exactly motivational when it comes to self-improvement: the creeping fear that you might be living in the end times is a poor basis for making a new beginning.

For one thing, it\u2019s by no means clear that it\u2019s possible to transform yourself through the simple application of individual willpower: wherever you come down on nature and nurture, it\u2019s undeniable that we owe much of our success or failure in life to our circumstances, and to luck. Then there is the infuriating psychological quirk of \u201chedonic adaptation\u201d, otherwise known as the happiness treadmill. Succeed in improving your life, and the improvement will soon become part of the backdrop of your days, and thus cease delivering pleasure; to recover that sense of vitality and zest, you\u2019ll have to reinvent yourself again, ad infinitum.</p> <p>Finally, there\u2019s the conundrum that the self being reinvented is the same one that\u2019s doing the reinventing \u2013 so your existing flaws invariably get baked into your vision of the future. If you yearn to become, say, more productive or empathetic or physically fit in 2019, how do you know that very yearning isn\u2019t just another expression of your tendency to beat yourself up, which you\u2019d be better off addressing than indulging? Or suppose you plan to conquer your perfectionism: how will you avoid getting all perfectionistic about that? There are no completely fresh starts, there is no year zero. You\u2019re already hopelessly ensnared in the only life you\u2019ll ever get.</p> <p>In response to the prevailing mood, there has been a noticeable change of tone in the world of self-help, a publishing genre historically dedicated to promising massive, near-effortless transformation overnight, or in a couple of weeks at most. For a while now, that hyperbole has been losing ground to a spirit of anti-utopianism \u2013 of accepting yourself as you are, building a good-enough life, or just protecting yourself from the worst of the world outside. Adult colouring books are the most easily mockable manifestation of this urge. But it\u2019s detectible, too, in the unceasing stream of Scandinavian lifestyle concepts \u2013 <em>hygge</em>, <em>lagom</em>, and the rest \u2013 with their focus on hunkering down and getting cosy; and in the ongoing rediscovery of Stoic philosophy and the championing of \u201cresilience\u201d as techniques for enduring life\u2019s blows.</p> <p>And it\u2019s everywhere present, this time around, in the phase of the publishing calendar irritatingly known as \u201cNew Year, New You\u201d. One thought-provoking example is a new edition of <em>Solve for Happy</em> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/30/google-mo-gawdat-solve-for-happy-interview\" title=\"\">Mo Gawdat</a>, formerly a senior executive with Google X, the search giant\u2019s secretive research and development arm. Generally speaking, the notion that \u201chappiness is an engineering problem\u201d is one to distrust. But Gawdat, far from championing the tech multimillionaire lifestyle as the only one worth aiming for, writes movingly of having achieved it, only to discover its emptiness. And he has endured far worse, losing his 21-year-old son Ali as a result of complications during routine surgery.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The hyperbole of overnight transformation has lost ground to a spirit of anti-utopianism \u2013 of accepting yourself as you are</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the core of Gawdat\u2019s \u201cformula for happiness\u201d is the venerable observation that happiness equals reality minus expectations: in order to feel distress because your life is lacking something, you must first have had some expectation of attaining that thing. (My life lacks a 70ft yacht, but this causes me no suffering, because I never imagined I\u2019d have one.) The argument is not, as progressive critics of self-help sometimes imagine, that disadvantaged people need only stop expecting anything better in order to be content. Some expectations \u2013 a reasonable standard of living, healthcare, fulfilling work, social connection \u2013 may be entirely rational. But seeing the truth of the formula acts as a kind of sieve, allowing you to separate the handful of things you genuinely want from life from those you\u2019ve been socialised into believing you should want. The latter aren\u2019t worth the pursuit \u2013 and if they are the reason you\u2019re trying to invent a \u201cnew you\u201d, you\u2019re better off sticking with the old one.</p> <p><strong>\u00b6</strong></p> <p>One of the most rigorous articulations of the new mood of acceptance is <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/happy-ever-after-628587.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Happy Ever After: Escaping</a></em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/happy-ever-after-628587.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/happy-ever-after-628587.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">the Myth of the Perfect Life</a></em> by Paul Dolan, a professor of behavioural science at the LSE and, the publicity material explains, \u201can internationally renowned expert in human behaviour and happiness\u201d. His book is a persuasive demolition of many of our cultural stories about how we ought to live, including the idea that there\u2019s anything particularly desirable about being a senior academic or a renowned expert. In fact, his data suggests, pursuing education beyond the age of 18 is unlikely to make much positive difference to the pleasure or sense of purpose you experience in life: on average, after secondary school, \u201chappiness decreases as education increases\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4d1cedde962d2ab3e199baec80d673b588403dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4d1cedde962d2ab3e199baec80d673b588403dd/0_0_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Dolan identifies the \u2018narrative traps\u2019 in wellbeing research.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Dolan identifies the \u2018narrative traps\u2019 in wellbeing research.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeremy Baile</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Dolan concedes, it can be notoriously hard to pin down the direction of causation in wellbeing research: it could be that gloomier people are more prone to doing university degrees, rather than that degrees make people gloomy. Yet either way, the belief that more education equals more fulfilment is a clear example of what he calls a \u201cnarrative trap\u201d \u2013 a socially imposed message about the ideal life that doesn\u2019t match real experience. This ideal often ends up doing more harm than good, either by propelling people into lives they don\u2019t enjoy, or by wrongly convincing those who don\u2019t make the grade that they are missing out on a more satisfying existence. Another trap is the belief that higher-status jobs reliably bring more satisfaction (in fact, florists are generally much happier than lawyers), or that a larger income necessarily buys more happiness (it does, but only up to about \u00a350,000 a year; beyond that, tasks related to earning more money squeeze out more enjoyable ones).</p> <p>These sorts of findings are increasingly well known, but where Dolan excels is in drawing attention to how stubbornly we resist their implications. If happiness and a sense of purpose are your goals in life, then a \u201cgood job\u201d or education or salary that fails to deliver them isn\u2019t really \u201cgood\u201d in any meaningful sense of the word \u2013 which makes it a strange thing to strive for, or to encourage your children to strive for. Oh, and speaking of children, the evidence is that parenthood won\u2019t make you happier, either. (It does boost people\u2019s sense of purpose, although apparently not more than various other things.) Likewise the dedicated pursuit of physical fitness, which turns out to lead to less happiness than you\u2019d think. And marriage: it\u2019s true that married people tell researchers they are happier than when they were single, but only if their husband or wife is present in the room during the interview.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The message of self-reinvention is never relax, since you could always benefit from acquiring more money and status</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What makes <em>Happy Ever After</em> somewhat radical, at least by the standards of popular psychology, is its recognition that these narrative traps aren\u2019t simply inexplicable mistakes we happen to make, but the products of ideology. They may not serve us, but they certainly serve the system in which we find ourselves embedded. The pursuit of wealth or social mobility might not bring happiness, but it does fuel economic growth \u2013 while marriage, parenthood, fitness and the rest keep the whole operation running smoothly into the next generation. Dolan focuses on how uniquely detrimental such messages can be for children from working-class families. Stereotypes about appropriate accents and lifestyles may deter them from going to university at all; those who make it into middle-class professions then face self-consciousness and insecurity about fitting in. Dolan, raised \u201clower working class\u201d in east London, writes that he still struggles with the cultural codes of academia: \u201cI weight train with bodybuilders. Seeing a blazer or a pair of loafers at a bodybuilding competition is as rare as rocking-horse shit.\u201d</p> <p>The new crop of anti-perfectionist self-help books are an important counterweight to the conventional message of self-reinvention, which is that there\u2019s no point at which it makes sense to be satisfied with your situation and finally relax, since you could always benefit from acquiring more money, status, education, and so on. What\u2019s less clear is whether this humbler kind of advice is any easier to implement, on a practical level, than the old sort. Apart from anything else, our narratives about the perfect life aren\u2019t just beliefs we can choose to jettison by a mere act of will, after reading about research that refutes them. They are deeply entrenched in the culture, reinforced by the media, inculcated in us as small children, not to mention in our genes. (There are some obvious evolutionary advantages to constantly craving more resources, and never feeling as if what you\u2019ve got is sufficient.) Moreover, no research finding about the average happiness of the general population can decisively prove that a given lifestyle choice is the right or wrong one for you, with all your idiosyncrasies. One chapter in <em>Happy Ever After</em> gamely makes the case for polyamorous relationships as a path to increased happiness, but whatever your reaction to that prospect \u2013 thrilling erotic adventure, or indescribable hassle? \u2013 it\u2019s not clear that you should try to override it based on the results of academic studies.</p> <p>There\u2019s another, more mind-bending problem with using this kind of research to direct personal change, which is that many such transitions are what the philosopher LA Paul calls \u201ctransformative experiences\u201d: they turn you into a person so different that you\u2019re unable, from the vantage point of the present, to imagine what that future person will make of them. To pick the most obvious example, becoming a parent might transform you into the kind of person who adores having children, even if beforehand you weren\u2019t. But it might just as easily work the other way, turning someone enthusiastic about the prospect into the kind who\u2019d never have chosen to do so.</p> <p>Nonetheless, it\u2019s psychologically freeing to be reminded that there is no single path to satisfaction \u2013 and that if circumstances or personal preferences disbar you from following the herd, you still have a good shot at fulfilment. \u201cQuite a lot of what passes itself off as dialogue about our society,\u201d the essayist Tim Kreider has written, \u201cconsists of people trying to justify their choices as the only right or natural ones by denouncing others\u2019 as selfish or pathological or wrong. So it\u2019s easy to overlook that hidden behind all this smug certainty is a poignant insecurity, and the naked 3am terror of regret.\u201d Much of the time, when it comes to building a meaningful life, you\u2019re flying blind. But the comforting truth is that so is everyone else.</p> <p><strong>\u00b6</strong></p> <p>Then again, judging by its continued dominance of the self-help shelves, you\u2019d be forgiven for concluding that the key to a perfect life was indisputable: lots and lots of Buddhist (or at least Buddhist-inspired) meditation. This is ironic, since Buddhism embodies one of the earliest confrontations with the truth about the perfectionist standards by which we judge the world and ourselves \u2013 that this is a recipe for permanent dissatisfaction. The basic situation, Buddha famously said, is that life is suffering. Everything is impermanent; old age, sickness and death are our inescapable human fate. And your philosophy of happiness had better acknowledge these realities, otherwise the only possible result is even more suffering, for you and everyone around you.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8161672891704fb104b4b051a683492cf02ed0db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8161672891704fb104b4b051a683492cf02ed0db/0_265_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Especially eloquent on life\u2019s smaller dissatisfactions \u2026 South Korean Zen writer Haemin Sunim.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Especially eloquent on life\u2019s smaller dissatisfactions \u2026 South Korean Zen writer Haemin Sunim.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WENN Rights Ltd/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While he probably wouldn\u2019t put it so bluntly, this is the spirit that imbues a new work by the South Korean Zen writer and former monk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/25/haemin-sunim-things-you-can-only-see-when-you-slow-down\" title=\"\">Haemin Sunim</a>, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/love-for-imperfect-things.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Love for Imperfect Things: How to Be Kind and Forgiving Toward Yourself and Others</a></em>. In these snark-saturated times, it\u2019s cheering that a voice as quietly friendly as Haemin\u2019s can make you a mega-celebrity: he has a combined social media following of around 2 million people, plus a previous global bestseller, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/things-you-can-see-only-when-you-slow-down-548979.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">The Things You Can </a></em><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/things-you-can-see-only-when-you-slow-down-548979.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">See Only When You Slow Down</a></em>. (In Seoul, where he lives, he presides over a Zen-infused therapy centre, the School for Broken Hearts, but the primary vehicle for his teaching is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/haeminsunim?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">Twitter</a>.)</p> <p>Haemin is especially eloquent on life\u2019s smaller dissatisfactions, and how they can sometimes be trickier to deal with than the bigger, more dramatic ones. For example, though it\u2019s a good thing that we talk so much more openly today about mental illness, one perverse consequence is that it can actually be easier to admit to a serious depression than to a milder, pervasive sense of disappointment in life. \u201cUnlike other emotions, disappointment is very tricky to express: it comes out as petty and small-minded,\u201d Haemin writes; it also tends to sound like you\u2019re blaming other people for failing to measure up. Yet of course it\u2019s a far more widespread problem than severe suffering. It has been argued that Buddha\u2019s observation that \u201clife is suffering\u201d might be more accurately translated as something like \u201clife is bothersome\u201d. (With luck, extreme agony will be very infrequent in your life, but a background sense of things being not quite right may be truly close to universal.) The first step towards relieving this kind of discontent, Haemin suggests, is to recognise the untenability of the demand that you, or anyone you encounter, should demonstrate perfection to begin with. Much of the bothersomeness of daily life arises not from circumstances themselves, but from the insistence that they ought to be other than they are.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d17ab21c2d9e6068aa0170cd6483b4c5f52a813e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d17ab21c2d9e6068aa0170cd6483b4c5f52a813e/0_0_351_500/351.jpg\" alt=\"Love for Imperfect Things\" width=\"351\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Having not yet attained Haemin\u2019s tolerance for other people\u2019s flaws, I can\u2019t resist observing that his wisdom all too often comes across as platitudinous. The book\u2019s prose passages are interspersed with sections laid out as blank verse, inadvertently demonstrating that mundane reflections aren\u2019t transformed into profundities merely by centring them on the page and inserting a few line breaks. (A typical example: \u201cIf someone did not ask for your help, / do not try to solve her problem for her. / Though your intentions may be good, / You risk taking control away from her / and injuring her self-esteem.\u201d) Still, he\u2019s not wrong. And behind the sporadic banality lurks a bracingly hard-headed world view: reality is what it is, and a lot of unnecessary misery arises from demanding that things shouldn\u2019t be the way that \u2013 as a matter of stubborn fact \u2013 they are. This is not a counsel of resignation; having accepted the reality of your situation, it may well be appropriate to try to change it. But not denying how things stand is the essential first step. Or, as the psychotherapist Carl Rogers put it: \u201cThe curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It can be easier to locate fulfilment in the future, rather than run the risks involved in trying to achieve it now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ironically, if not very surprisingly, the wellbeing industry has proved adept at turning this new spirit of modesty and acceptance into another expensive consumerist pursuit. Those Scandinavian \u201csecrets of happiness\u201d are a case in point: \u201chygge\u201d may evoke contented relaxation around a familiar fireplace with old friends, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t spend almost \u00a3200 on a specially hygge-appropriate plant-dyed pillow, or \u00a380 on a set of candle holders, at the website <a href=\"https://www.hyggelife.com/\" title=\"\">hyggelife.com</a>. (And while \u201clagom\u201d may mean \u201cjust the right amount\u201d in Swedish, there are at least six recent books in English on the subject, which isn\u2019t just the right amount, but too many.) Your effort to become the sort of person who finds happiness in what they already have can easily become its own interminable quest, in which success \u2013 and therefore happiness \u2013 always lies in some fantasy of the future, rather than in the here and now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8f03b14bcdb765b572d14fc2fb827f87e3ff0ed8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f03b14bcdb765b572d14fc2fb827f87e3ff0ed8/0_0_334_499/334.jpg\" alt=\"The Courage To Be Disliked\" width=\"334\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As always, this is capitalism\u2019s fault. But most of us are complicit: we chase unattainable fantasies of self\u2011reinvention, rather than confronting reality, at least in part because life is easier that way. This is one of the lessons of an absorbing recent addition to the anti-perfectionist self-help subgenre, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/courage-to-be-disliked-630096.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">The Courage to Be Disliked</a></em>, by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga, published in English last year. (By then, it had reportedly already sold more than 3.5m copies in the original Japanese and other translations.) Despite all the \u201cnew Japanese phenomenon\u201d marketing \u2013 the book was described by one critic as \u201cMarie Kondo, but for your brain\u201d \u2013 it is primarily an accessible exploration of the work of the Austrian psychotherapist Alfred Adler. He held that we frequently cling to our problems, no matter how much we complain about them and claim we want to eradicate them, because overcoming them necessitates an encounter with fear. It can be easier to locate fulfilment \u2013 and fulfilment in intimate relationships above all \u2013 in the future, where we never quite have to do what it takes to attain it, rather than run the interpersonal risks involved in trying to achieve it now.</p> <p>The problem, as Kishimi and Koga make clear, is that this only makes for more suffering in the present, by systematically biasing you towards taking the kind of actions that postpone, rather than build, a meaningful life. In this way, fantasies of total self-transformation don\u2019t simply fail, they also block change of the more modest \u2013 but real \u2013 kind. And in any case, the future never seems to arrive: the truth is that the present is the only time it\u2019ll ever be possible to make a change. Transformative self-reinvention may be an overoptimistic dream, but defeatism about change is its own kind of false comfort, too: both are forms of absolutism that serve to justify passivity. We will fail to reinvent ourselves this January, or next month, or next January, or ever. But once we finally get that fact into our heads, we might at last be able to start making a few improvements.</p>",

In response to the prevailing mood, there has been a noticeable change of tone in the world of self-help, a publishing genre historically dedicated to promising massive, near-effortless transformation overnight, or in a couple of weeks at most. For a while now, that hyperbole has been losing ground to a spirit of anti-utopianism \u2013 of accepting yourself as you are, building a good-enough life, or just protecting yourself from the worst of the world outside. Adult colouring books are the most easily mockable manifestation of this urge. But it\u2019s detectible, too, in the unceasing stream of Scandinavian lifestyle concepts \u2013 hygge, lagom, and the rest \u2013 with their focus on hunkering down and getting cosy; and in the ongoing rediscovery of Stoic philosophy and the championing of \u201cresilience\u201d as techniques for enduring life\u2019s blows. And it\u2019s everywhere present, this time around, in the phase of the publishing calendar irritatingly known as \u201cNew Year, New You\u201d. One thought-provoking example is a new edition of Solve for Happy by Mo Gawdat, formerly a senior executive with Google X, the search giant\u2019s secretive research and development arm. Generally speaking, the notion that \u201chappiness is an engineering problem\u201d is one to distrust. But Gawdat, far from championing the tech multimillionaire lifestyle as the only one worth aiming for, writes movingly of having achieved it, only to discover its emptiness. And he has endured far worse, losing his 21-year-old son Ali as a result of complications during routine surgery. At the core of Gawdat\u2019s \u201cformula for happiness\u201d is the venerable observation that happiness equals reality minus expectations: in order to feel distress because your life is lacking something, you must first have had some expectation of attaining that thing. (My life lacks a 70ft yacht, but this causes me no suffering, because I never imagined I\u2019d have one.) The argument is not, as progressive critics of self-help sometimes imagine, that disadvantaged people need only stop expecting anything better in order to be content. Some expectations \u2013 a reasonable standard of living, healthcare, fulfilling work, social connection \u2013 may be entirely rational. But seeing the truth of the formula acts as a kind of sieve, allowing you to separate the handful of things you genuinely want from life from those you\u2019ve been socialised into believing you should want. The latter aren\u2019t worth the pursuit \u2013 and if they are the reason you\u2019re trying to invent a \u201cnew you\u201d, you\u2019re better off sticking with the old one. \u00b6 One of the most rigorous articulations of the new mood of acceptance is Happy Ever After: Escaping the Myth of the Perfect Life by Paul Dolan, a professor of behavioural science at the LSE and, the publicity material explains, \u201can internationally renowned expert in human behaviour and happiness\u201d. His book is a persuasive demolition of many of our cultural stories about how we ought to live, including the idea that there\u2019s anything particularly desirable about being a senior academic or a renowned expert. In fact, his data suggests, pursuing education beyond the age of 18 is unlikely to make much positive difference to the pleasure or sense of purpose you experience in life: on average, after secondary school, \u201chappiness decreases as education increases\u201d. As Dolan concedes, it can be notoriously hard to pin down the direction of causation in wellbeing research: it could be that gloomier people are more prone to doing university degrees, rather than that degrees make people gloomy. Yet either way, the belief that more education equals more fulfilment is a clear example of what he calls a \u201cnarrative trap\u201d \u2013 a socially imposed message about the ideal life that doesn\u2019t match real experience. This ideal often ends up doing more harm than good, either by propelling people into lives they don\u2019t enjoy, or by wrongly convincing those who don\u2019t make the grade that they are missing out on a more satisfying existence. Another trap is the belief that higher-status jobs reliably bring more satisfaction (in fact, florists are generally much happier than lawyers), or that a larger income necessarily buys more happiness (it does, but only up to about \u00a350,000 a year; beyond that, tasks related to earning more money squeeze out more enjoyable ones). These sorts of findings are increasingly well known, but where Dolan excels is in drawing attention to how stubbornly we resist their implications. If happiness and a sense of purpose are your goals in life, then a \u201cgood job\u201d or education or salary that fails to deliver them isn\u2019t really \u201cgood\u201d in any meaningful sense of the word \u2013 which makes it a strange thing to strive for, or to encourage your children to strive for. Oh, and speaking of children, the evidence is that parenthood won\u2019t make you happier, either. (It does boost people\u2019s sense of purpose, although apparently not more than various other things.) Likewise the dedicated pursuit of physical fitness, which turns out to lead to less happiness than you\u2019d think. And marriage: it\u2019s true that married people tell researchers they are happier than when they were single, but only if their husband or wife is present in the room during the interview. What makes Happy Ever After somewhat radical, at least by the standards of popular psychology, is its recognition that these narrative traps aren\u2019t simply inexplicable mistakes we happen to make, but the products of ideology. They may not serve us, but they certainly serve the system in which we find ourselves embedded. The pursuit of wealth or social mobility might not bring happiness, but it does fuel economic growth \u2013 while marriage, parenthood, fitness and the rest keep the whole operation running smoothly into the next generation. Dolan focuses on how uniquely detrimental such messages can be for children from working-class families. Stereotypes about appropriate accents and lifestyles may deter them from going to university at all; those who make it into middle-class professions then face self-consciousness and insecurity about fitting in. Dolan, raised \u201clower working class\u201d in east London, writes that he still struggles with the cultural codes of academia: \u201cI weight train with bodybuilders. Seeing a blazer or a pair of loafers at a bodybuilding competition is as rare as rocking-horse shit.\u201d The new crop of anti-perfectionist self-help books are an important counterweight to the conventional message of self-reinvention, which is that there\u2019s no point at which it makes sense to be satisfied with your situation and finally relax, since you could always benefit from acquiring more money, status, education, and so on. What\u2019s less clear is whether this humbler kind of advice is any easier to implement, on a practical level, than the old sort. Apart from anything else, our narratives about the perfect life aren\u2019t just beliefs we can choose to jettison by a mere act of will, after reading about research that refutes them. They are deeply entrenched in the culture, reinforced by the media, inculcated in us as small children, not to mention in our genes. (There are some obvious evolutionary advantages to constantly craving more resources, and never feeling as if what you\u2019ve got is sufficient.) Moreover, no research finding about the average happiness of the general population can decisively prove that a given lifestyle choice is the right or wrong one for you, with all your idiosyncrasies. One chapter in Happy Ever After gamely makes the case for polyamorous relationships as a path to increased happiness, but whatever your reaction to that prospect \u2013 thrilling erotic adventure, or indescribable hassle? \u2013 it\u2019s not clear that you should try to override it based on the results of academic studies. There\u2019s another, more mind-bending problem with using this kind of research to direct personal change, which is that many such transitions are what the philosopher LA Paul calls \u201ctransformative experiences\u201d: they turn you into a person so different that you\u2019re unable, from the vantage point of the present, to imagine what that future person will make of them. To pick the most obvious example, becoming a parent might transform you into the kind of person who adores having children, even if beforehand you weren\u2019t. But it might just as easily work the other way, turning someone enthusiastic about the prospect into the kind who\u2019d never have chosen to do so. Nonetheless, it\u2019s psychologically freeing to be reminded that there is no single path to satisfaction \u2013 and that if circumstances or personal preferences disbar you from following the herd, you still have a good shot at fulfilment. \u201cQuite a lot of what passes itself off as dialogue about our society,\u201d the essayist Tim Kreider has written, \u201cconsists of people trying to justify their choices as the only right or natural ones by denouncing others\u2019 as selfish or pathological or wrong. So it\u2019s easy to overlook that hidden behind all this smug certainty is a poignant insecurity, and the naked 3am terror of regret.\u201d Much of the time, when it comes to building a meaningful life, you\u2019re flying blind. But the comforting truth is that so is everyone else. \u00b6 Then again, judging by its continued dominance of the self-help shelves, you\u2019d be forgiven for concluding that the key to a perfect life was indisputable: lots and lots of Buddhist (or at least Buddhist-inspired) meditation. This is ironic, since Buddhism embodies one of the earliest confrontations with the truth about the perfectionist standards by which we judge the world and ourselves \u2013 that this is a recipe for permanent dissatisfaction. The basic situation, Buddha famously said, is that life is suffering. Everything is impermanent; old age, sickness and death are our inescapable human fate. And your philosophy of happiness had better acknowledge these realities, otherwise the only possible result is even more suffering, for you and everyone around you. While he probably wouldn\u2019t put it so bluntly, this is the spirit that imbues a new work by the South Korean Zen writer and former monk Haemin Sunim, Love for Imperfect Things: How to Be Kind and Forgiving Toward Yourself and Others. In these snark-saturated times, it\u2019s cheering that a voice as quietly friendly as Haemin\u2019s can make you a mega-celebrity: he has a combined social media following of around 2 million people, plus a previous global bestseller, The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down. (In Seoul, where he lives, he presides over a Zen-infused therapy centre, the School for Broken Hearts, but the primary vehicle for his teaching is Twitter.) Haemin is especially eloquent on life\u2019s smaller dissatisfactions, and how they can sometimes be trickier to deal with than the bigger, more dramatic ones. For example, though it\u2019s a good thing that we talk so much more openly today about mental illness, one perverse consequence is that it can actually be easier to admit to a serious depression than to a milder, pervasive sense of disappointment in life. \u201cUnlike other emotions, disappointment is very tricky to express: it comes out as petty and small-minded,\u201d Haemin writes; it also tends to sound like you\u2019re blaming other people for failing to measure up. Yet of course it\u2019s a far more widespread problem than severe suffering. It has been argued that Buddha\u2019s observation that \u201clife is suffering\u201d might be more accurately translated as something like \u201clife is bothersome\u201d. (With luck, extreme agony will be very infrequent in your life, but a background sense of things being not quite right may be truly close to universal.) The first step towards relieving this kind of discontent, Haemin suggests, is to recognise the untenability of the demand that you, or anyone you encounter, should demonstrate perfection to begin with. Much of the bothersomeness of daily life arises not from circumstances themselves, but from the insistence that they ought to be other than they are. Having not yet attained Haemin\u2019s tolerance for other people\u2019s flaws, I can\u2019t resist observing that his wisdom all too often comes across as platitudinous. The book\u2019s prose passages are interspersed with sections laid out as blank verse, inadvertently demonstrating that mundane reflections aren\u2019t transformed into profundities merely by centring them on the page and inserting a few line breaks. (A typical example: \u201cIf someone did not ask for your help, / do not try to solve her problem for her. / Though your intentions may be good, / You risk taking control away from her / and injuring her self-esteem.\u201d) Still, he\u2019s not wrong. And behind the sporadic banality lurks a bracingly hard-headed world view: reality is what it is, and a lot of unnecessary misery arises from demanding that things shouldn\u2019t be the way that \u2013 as a matter of stubborn fact \u2013 they are. This is not a counsel of resignation; having accepted the reality of your situation, it may well be appropriate to try to change it. But not denying how things stand is the essential first step. Or, as the psychotherapist Carl Rogers put it: \u201cThe curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change.\u201d Ironically, if not very surprisingly, the wellbeing industry has proved adept at turning this new spirit of modesty and acceptance into another expensive consumerist pursuit. Those Scandinavian \u201csecrets of happiness\u201d are a case in point: \u201chygge\u201d may evoke contented relaxation around a familiar fireplace with old friends, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t spend almost \u00a3200 on a specially hygge-appropriate plant-dyed pillow, or \u00a380 on a set of candle holders, at the website hyggelife.com. (And while \u201clagom\u201d may mean \u201cjust the right amount\u201d in Swedish, there are at least six recent books in English on the subject, which isn\u2019t just the right amount, but too many.) Your effort to become the sort of person who finds happiness in what they already have can easily become its own interminable quest, in which success \u2013 and therefore happiness \u2013 always lies in some fantasy of the future, rather than in the here and now. As always, this is capitalism\u2019s fault. But most of us are complicit: we chase unattainable fantasies of self\u2011reinvention, rather than confronting reality, at least in part because life is easier that way. This is one of the lessons of an absorbing recent addition to the anti-perfectionist self-help subgenre, The Courage to Be Disliked, by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga, published in English last year. (By then, it had reportedly already sold more than 3.5m copies in the original Japanese and other translations.) Despite all the \u201cnew Japanese phenomenon\u201d marketing \u2013 the book was described by one critic as \u201cMarie Kondo, but for your brain\u201d \u2013 it is primarily an accessible exploration of the work of the Austrian psychotherapist Alfred Adler. He held that we frequently cling to our problems, no matter how much we complain about them and claim we want to eradicate them, because overcoming them necessitates an encounter with fear. It can be easier to locate fulfilment \u2013 and fulfilment in intimate relationships above all \u2013 in the future, where we never quite have to do what it takes to attain it, rather than run the interpersonal risks involved in trying to achieve it now. The problem, as Kishimi and Koga make clear, is that this only makes for more suffering in the present, by systematically biasing you towards taking the kind of actions that postpone, rather than build, a meaningful life. In this way, fantasies of total self-transformation don\u2019t simply fail, they also block change of the more modest \u2013 but real \u2013 kind. And in any case, the future never seems to arrive: the truth is that the present is the only time it\u2019ll ever be possible to make a change. Transformative self-reinvention may be an overoptimistic dream, but defeatism about change is its own kind of false comfort, too: both are forms of absolutism that serve to justify passivity. We will fail to reinvent ourselves this January, or next month, or next January, or ever. But once we finally get that fact into our heads, we might at last be able to start making a few improvements.",

But these themes will reach a huge audience though the writer\u2019s old-fashioned talents for compelling character, plotting and landscape description. \u2022 Mark Lawson\u2019s novel The Allegations is published by Picador.",

      "body": "<p>I was in my early 20s. I thought of myself as a poet, well aware of the rule that you couldn\u2019t call yourself one until you had had a book of poems published. In Stockholm, where I lived, a place called Forum had opened for people interested in poetry and art; it called itself a contemporary space for culture. In those days, the late 80s, it attracted a young, elitist crowd, where everyone shared a rather earnest desire for profound experiences. I didn\u2019t feel threatened by any of it. My parents were both well-known writers; my father a literary critic, my mother a poet and translator.</p> <p>I had no writer friends of my own age. I had fallen into the gap between an adult world to which I did not yet belong, and a young person\u2019s world that was mostly about sex and alcohol. I loved to dance. I loved going to nightclubs. The music, the anonymous backs at the bar, the dark corners. The smells of perfume, sweat, spilled drinks. The little details of men and women: a woman\u2019s shirt, dazzling white; a thin gold chain in a cleavage. Sometimes there were men I liked, or desired. I made it a point of honour to salute them, make a small bow, and turn on my heel. Sometimes the farewell itself worked as a seduction technique.</p> <p>I made no close friendships at the Forum, but I felt part of a circle, mostly made up of older male poets and artists. I got used to being precocious and the youngest. Hanging out with older men gave me the freedom to be young and act old. </p> <p>***</p> <p>It is some years later, and I have submitted a book of poems, had it rejected and rewritten it. Now it has been accepted. Someone wonders whether it\u2019s because it\u2019s good or because I have parents with contacts. It\u2019s an unanswerable question, and I make a joke of it. I know I can\u2019t do any better, but when I read the proofs I wonder if it really is good enough.</p> <p>Soon I am invited to read my poems at the Forum. The host there is a man named Jean-Claude Arnault, in his mid-40s and<strong> </strong>married to the poet Katarina Frostenson. He is the frontman; she is the mysterious figure in the background. Jean-Claude is a restless artistic type, a sort of director and doorman who impatiently rattles chairs, pours wine, manages to keep an eye on the stage, the house and the crush at the interval. He kisses women on the cheek, remembers faces, and holds a tender, protective hand behind the back of older visitors negotiating the steep stairs down to the venue. Sometimes I hear him make lewd comments about young women, but I choose to hear them as puerile humour. They\u2019re never funny, but they are something easy to brush away, like dandruff on a shoulder. He is French, after all, and speaks Swedish with an accent. Perhaps he wouldn\u2019t sound so crude in French? </p> <p>One day I see him right at the back of the club, having a go at a young woman standing behind a trestle table of wine glasses. He is very close to her, gesticulating and wagging his finger. I wonder what has made him so angry, what gives him permission to act that way. The woman seems strong. Her face is like a mask. Dark eyes; a clear red mouth. A black lace vest under her suit jacket. I like to wear black, too, but I would never wear a lacy top. It is too obvious, too much of a bohemian cliche, like round framed glasses, dresses with abstract prints, biker boots and dyed hair. But the lace is beautiful against her pale skin. I\u2019m impressed by the way she stays so calm.</p> <p>***</p> <p>One early afternoon, I agree to meet Jean-Claude in the office at the club to discuss my forthcoming reading. A woman a little older than me pours coffee in dark cups. A vein sticks out on her forehead, becoming more prominent as she bends forward to place the cups on the table. Jean-Claude is angry with her about something to do with the upcoming programme. He asks her to go and make a few calls, leaving us to talk. We sit on the sofa, so close that our knees and shoulders touch. Sometimes I nudge him with my arm, in a friendly way. The gesture is a way of showing that I can afford to be a bit familiar; that we trust each other. He seems grateful that I want to appear on his stage. I\u2019m grateful that he\u2019ll let me do it. My shoulder against his upper arm implies that we have a past together, although we don\u2019t.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t want to have sex with him. But I want us to have something adult, between equals. I take off my clothes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The fear that he might grow bad-tempered diminishes. He says I am to read for 10 minutes, 15 at most. There is a growing, definite feeling that we have something between us. It\u2019s exciting and ambiguous. I tell myself it is mutual respect.</p> <p>When we have drunk our coffee we go into the club itself. He locks the door behind us and shows me the green room. Then he asks me to take off my clothes.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to have sex with him. He is 24 years older than me. On the other hand, I want the two of us to have something special: something adult, between equals. I take off my clothes. The heatpipes sigh. He doesn\u2019t hurt me; nor does he give me pleasure. It\u2019s a neutral act. There is no resistance and no understanding. It must be a ritual, I think. I notice that his skin is like paper. I look at the ceiling.</p> <p>My body is on the cold concrete floor. An old carpet, rolled up, supports my head. Jean-Claude, still fully dressed, is almost nonchalant. He tells me I need not worry about pregnancy: he\u2019s sterile. I read the spines of the books on the shelves. My legs seem to be floating. I wish I were more androgynous, the way I feel I really I am. My eyes jump between book spines and body parts. I imagine how I might write this scene, how I would turn the present into a memory.</p> <p>He tells me that he and Katarina have an open relationship, but that what we\u2019ve done should still be a secret. Later I think, did he really say \u201copen\u201d, or had I had sex with a married man whose wife would dislike it if she knew? Suppose he was in love with me. The fact that he had told me about his sterility made me believe that he had been faithful to his wife for decades; I had no need to worry about picking up a disease. Perhaps I should have said something similar myself \u2013 told him that I was probably clean, that I had recently taken an HIV test and wasn\u2019t infected. I wished I could read the situation better.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7af8aab23799c1edff01543d1e053378d529eb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7af8aab23799c1edff01543d1e053378d529eb0/19_422_5469_3281/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johanna Ekstr\u00f6m\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Was it a kind of transaction \u2013 sex for entry to the inner circle?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Schori/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Was it his way of creating a bond of friendship; a kind of handshake? Or was it a kind of transaction \u2013 sex for entry to the inner circle? But I didn\u2019t think I had anything to gain. Maybe I was so light-heartedly ready to pay the price precisely because he had no real power over me.</p> <p>***</p> <p>One day a few months later, I look in at the office and find myself alone with Jean-Claude. He asks if I want to go home with him so he can show me some paintings he knows I am interested in. I don\u2019t ask if Katarina is at home; I assume she is at least local. The mood between us is not as friendly as before. There is an edge, a mocking tone. He brings up my age, my poetry collection, my next book, my ancestry, my relationship with my father, my way of life \u2013 as if he wants to see what is real, and what is just cladding.</p> <p>I feel my own inadequacy, which makes me want to fight back. My ability to put up a front diminishes the closer we come to their house. I feel as though I am trying to avoid something that has already happened \u2013 to return to the scene of the crime to undo something, to smooth it over, to rewrite the story. I want to erase what has happened; transform it into a story about two friends, without a murky past. I almost manage. As we speak there is a masculine, almost conspiratorial tone between us; an easiness. But something doesn\u2019t fit. </p> <p>He shows me the paintings. He shows me their bedroom and a painting there. He suggests that we have sex on their bed. I have a brief, dreadful thought: Katarina is in the flat, hidden behind a curtain. This is a game they have made up together. But she doesn\u2019t appear.</p> <p>We sit on their bed. It is twilight. Their separate duvets are in shadow, the pillows still marked where their heads were. I say no, that it isn\u2019t a good idea. I say no again. Jean-Claude is insistent but not threatening. I say: \u201cI\u2019m far too old for you,\u201d thinking myself witty. I kiss him on the forehead, and tell myself that my kiss is both motherly and androgynous.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Five years after the encounter on the concrete floor, my father was elected to the Swedish Academy, where he sat alongside Katarina. In due course he became chairman of the Nobel prize committee. I published my first collection of short stories. One of them was about a young woman who has a relationship with an older man. It was based on real life: a love affair which lasted some years.</p> <p>Early one morning after the story had been published, the phone rang. I was living in the same part of the city as the Forum club, with my husband and his daughters. I lay in bed, picked up the receiver, and was surprised to hear the voice of Jean-Claude. We had never called one another, but saw each other from time to time at the club, which I still visited occasionally, most often as part of the audience but sometimes to perform. He was very upset. His voice was low.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3d53cf914a8fb531fbde2a2444521951c0b9e1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3d53cf914a8fb531fbde2a2444521951c0b9e1f/249_304_2584_3229/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jean-Claude Arnault with his wife, the poet Katarina Frostenson, in 2011\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jean-Claude Arnault with his wife, the poet Katarina Frostenson, in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said that he and Katarina, or Katta, as he called her, were grateful for the book I had sent them, but that both had been very disturbed by one story \u2013 I knew which one, right? He said he understood that the erotic short story was about him; that I had flagrantly, if flatteringly, revealed our relationship, and that I must now deny that the story was about him.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not about you!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cHow could it be?\u201d My denial counted as further evidence that the material was explosive. He said that I had placed both of them, and myself, in a very delicate position. He said: \u201cShe\u2019s really furious with you now!\u201d I trembled with shock.

      "bodyText": "I was in my early 20s. I thought of myself as a poet, well aware of the rule that you couldn\u2019t call yourself one until you had had a book of poems published. In Stockholm, where I lived, a place called Forum had opened for people interested in poetry and art; it called itself a contemporary space for culture. In those days, the late 80s, it attracted a young, elitist crowd, where everyone shared a rather earnest desire for profound experiences. I didn\u2019t feel threatened by any of it. My parents were both well-known writers; my father a literary critic, my mother a poet and translator. I had no writer friends of my own age. I had fallen into the gap between an adult world to which I did not yet belong, and a young person\u2019s world that was mostly about sex and alcohol. I loved to dance. I loved going to nightclubs. The music, the anonymous backs at the bar, the dark corners. The smells of perfume, sweat, spilled drinks. The little details of men and women: a woman\u2019s shirt, dazzling white; a thin gold chain in a cleavage. Sometimes there were men I liked, or desired. I made it a point of honour to salute them, make a small bow, and turn on my heel. Sometimes the farewell itself worked as a seduction technique. I made no close friendships at the Forum, but I felt part of a circle, mostly made up of older male poets and artists. I got used to being precocious and the youngest. Hanging out with older men gave me the freedom to be young and act old. *** It is some years later, and I have submitted a book of poems, had it rejected and rewritten it. Now it has been accepted. Someone wonders whether it\u2019s because it\u2019s good or because I have parents with contacts. It\u2019s an unanswerable question, and I make a joke of it. I know I can\u2019t do any better, but when I read the proofs I wonder if it really is good enough. Soon I am invited to read my poems at the Forum. The host there is a man named Jean-Claude Arnault, in his mid-40s and married to the poet Katarina Frostenson. He is the frontman; she is the mysterious figure in the background. Jean-Claude is a restless artistic type, a sort of director and doorman who impatiently rattles chairs, pours wine, manages to keep an eye on the stage, the house and the crush at the interval. He kisses women on the cheek, remembers faces, and holds a tender, protective hand behind the back of older visitors negotiating the steep stairs down to the venue. Sometimes I hear him make lewd comments about young women, but I choose to hear them as puerile humour. They\u2019re never funny, but they are something easy to brush away, like dandruff on a shoulder. He is French, after all, and speaks Swedish with an accent. Perhaps he wouldn\u2019t sound so crude in French? One day I see him right at the back of the club, having a go at a young woman standing behind a trestle table of wine glasses. He is very close to her, gesticulating and wagging his finger. I wonder what has made him so angry, what gives him permission to act that way. The woman seems strong. Her face is like a mask. Dark eyes; a clear red mouth. A black lace vest under her suit jacket. I like to wear black, too, but I would never wear a lacy top. It is too obvious, too much of a bohemian cliche, like round framed glasses, dresses with abstract prints, biker boots and dyed hair. But the lace is beautiful against her pale skin. I\u2019m impressed by the way she stays so calm. *** One early afternoon, I agree to meet Jean-Claude in the office at the club to discuss my forthcoming reading. A woman a little older than me pours coffee in dark cups. A vein sticks out on her forehead, becoming more prominent as she bends forward to place the cups on the table. Jean-Claude is angry with her about something to do with the upcoming programme. He asks her to go and make a few calls, leaving us to talk. We sit on the sofa, so close that our knees and shoulders touch. Sometimes I nudge him with my arm, in a friendly way. The gesture is a way of showing that I can afford to be a bit familiar; that we trust each other. He seems grateful that I want to appear on his stage. I\u2019m grateful that he\u2019ll let me do it. My shoulder against his upper arm implies that we have a past together, although we don\u2019t. The fear that he might grow bad-tempered diminishes. He says I am to read for 10 minutes, 15 at most. There is a growing, definite feeling that we have something between us. It\u2019s exciting and ambiguous. I tell myself it is mutual respect. When we have drunk our coffee we go into the club itself. He locks the door behind us and shows me the green room. Then he asks me to take off my clothes. I don\u2019t want to have sex with him. He is 24 years older than me. On the other hand, I want the two of us to have something special: something adult, between equals. I take off my clothes. The heatpipes sigh. He doesn\u2019t hurt me; nor does he give me pleasure. It\u2019s a neutral act. There is no resistance and no understanding. It must be a ritual, I think. I notice that his skin is like paper. I look at the ceiling. My body is on the cold concrete floor. An old carpet, rolled up, supports my head. Jean-Claude, still fully dressed, is almost nonchalant. He tells me I need not worry about pregnancy: he\u2019s sterile. I read the spines of the books on the shelves. My legs seem to be floating. I wish I were more androgynous, the way I feel I really I am. My eyes jump between book spines and body parts. I imagine how I might write this scene, how I would turn the present into a memory. He tells me that he and Katarina have an open relationship, but that what we\u2019ve done should still be a secret. Later I think, did he really say \u201copen\u201d, or had I had sex with a married man whose wife would dislike it if she knew? Suppose he was in love with me. The fact that he had told me about his sterility made me believe that he had been faithful to his wife for decades; I had no need to worry about picking up a disease. Perhaps I should have said something similar myself \u2013 told him that I was probably clean, that I had recently taken an HIV test and wasn\u2019t infected. I wished I could read the situation better. Was it his way of creating a bond of friendship; a kind of handshake? Or was it a kind of transaction \u2013 sex for entry to the inner circle? But I didn\u2019t think I had anything to gain. Maybe I was so light-heartedly ready to pay the price precisely because he had no real power over me. *** One day a few months later, I look in at the office and find myself alone with Jean-Claude. He asks if I want to go home with him so he can show me some paintings he knows I am interested in. I don\u2019t ask if Katarina is at home; I assume she is at least local. The mood between us is not as friendly as before. There is an edge, a mocking tone. He brings up my age, my poetry collection, my next book, my ancestry, my relationship with my father, my way of life \u2013 as if he wants to see what is real, and what is just cladding. I feel my own inadequacy, which makes me want to fight back. My ability to put up a front diminishes the closer we come to their house. I feel as though I am trying to avoid something that has already happened \u2013 to return to the scene of the crime to undo something, to smooth it over, to rewrite the story. I want to erase what has happened; transform it into a story about two friends, without a murky past. I almost manage. As we speak there is a masculine, almost conspiratorial tone between us; an easiness. But something doesn\u2019t fit. He shows me the paintings. He shows me their bedroom and a painting there. He suggests that we have sex on their bed. I have a brief, dreadful thought: Katarina is in the flat, hidden behind a curtain. This is a game they have made up together. But she doesn\u2019t appear. We sit on their bed. It is twilight. Their separate duvets are in shadow, the pillows still marked where their heads were. I say no, that it isn\u2019t a good idea. I say no again. Jean-Claude is insistent but not threatening. I say: \u201cI\u2019m far too old for you,\u201d thinking myself witty. I kiss him on the forehead, and tell myself that my kiss is both motherly and androgynous. *** Five years after the encounter on the concrete floor, my father was elected to the Swedish Academy, where he sat alongside Katarina. In due course he became chairman of the Nobel prize committee. I published my first collection of short stories. One of them was about a young woman who has a relationship with an older man. It was based on real life: a love affair which lasted some years. Early one morning after the story had been published, the phone rang. I was living in the same part of the city as the Forum club, with my husband and his daughters. I lay in bed, picked up the receiver, and was surprised to hear the voice of Jean-Claude. We had never called one another, but saw each other from time to time at the club, which I still visited occasionally, most often as part of the audience but sometimes to perform. He was very upset. His voice was low. He said that he and Katarina, or Katta, as he called her, were grateful for the book I had sent them, but that both had been very disturbed by one story \u2013 I knew which one, right? He said he understood that the erotic short story was about him; that I had flagrantly, if flatteringly, revealed our relationship, and that I must now deny that the story was about him. \u201cBut it\u2019s not about you!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cHow could it be?\u201d My denial counted as further evidence that the material was explosive. He said that I had placed both of them, and myself, in a very delicate position. He said: \u201cShe\u2019s really furious with you now!\u201d I trembled with shock. I felt accused, even though I was innocent. But of course I was also guilty, despite everything. The dark memory of the basement floor. Me naked: him almost fully dressed, his black jeans pulled down. What was the truth behind his phone call? Was Katarina really upset? Did she really think the short story was unmasking him? Had she read it at all? Or was it just that he wanted me to correct what he saw as my testimony, from some combination of self-esteem and a sudden loss of control? I wanted to protect myself from my own memories. I wanted to protect what I had written. I also wanted to protect the good memories that had been the foundation of the short story. It felt as if I had joined the game, endured it, wanted it, but then suddenly got tired, forgetting the rules. *** Now, 28 years later, when I look back at what happened in the basement at Forum, at Jean-Claude, and Katarina, and the young woman I then was, I do so with dark, mixed feelings. When last year, the journalist Matilda Gustavsson published the testimony of 18 women who accused Jean-Claude of sexual assault and harassment, in the Dagens Nyheter newspaper, I felt a great weight lifted from me. It was as though the roof of the Forum club had been lifted off; what had been hidden floated into the light. It was no longer dangerous. But it hurt. The grief came later. I remembered the place where I had heard all that poetry and music; I thought of the importance of being able to perform there myself. I remembered the atmosphere of the room, a ceremonious, shared joy in art. Perhaps the knowledge of being chosen. It could have been wonderful, but it was not. Jean-Claude Arnault is in jail now, sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment on two counts of rape. Katarina Frostenson, who was a character witness for the defence at his trial, has herself been the subject of an investigation for conflict of interest \u2013 since the Academy subsidised the Forum club for many years. The scandal meant there was no Nobel prize for literature last year. This is not a story about a rape. Nor am I very interested in Jean-Claude himself. I am interested in my own route to that concrete floor. My memory is a series of still lives, fixed in time.

      "bodyText": "A British startup trying to counter the waste created by single-use coffee capsules says it will be strangled at birth by a no-deal Brexit. The founders of Moving Beans say Brexit is like a \u201cbomb dropping\u201d on their business, which started manufacturing in February. The firm is the latest to express frustration over the lack of understanding among Brexiters, such as the former minister Suella Braverman about the impact of no deal on real small to medium business. Moving Beans began producing coffee capsules using the fibre from sugar beet in response to a growing environmental backlash against single-serve pods such as those from Nespresso, which are advertised by George Clooney. The company claims to be the \u201cfirst in the world who have managed to solve the problem of producing Nespresso-compatible coffee capsules which are compostable and maintain a delicious coffee taste\u201d. But the team now fear for their future because of Brexit. Moving Beans employs three people and produces 5,000 capsules a month, with plans to expand to a staff of about 20 in two to three years. \u201cWe are trying to make a real difference, but this Brexit mess may actually really backfire on our company and eventually on the environmental wellbeing of the UK,\u201d said co-founder Mike, who asked for his surname not to be published. \u201cFalling back on the World Trade Organization will close many UK SMEs [small and medium enterprises] \u2013 it\u2019s real, not \u2018project fear\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bomb dropped [when] our fulfilment company in the UK sent us the tariffs we would need to pay if we were to fall back on World Trade Organization rules and the paperwork which would need to be provided. Our margins are gone, directly because of import fees (VAT + duty) and indirectly because of staff spending more time doing admin.\u201d They were told that under WTO tariffs they would have to pay 7.5% extra to import coffee for their capsules, which are manufactured on mainland Europe and could also attract a tariff \u2013 enough to decimate their profits. Mike explained that small margins or fluctuations in currency exchange rates could be absorbed by bigger and older businesses but not by startups, where everything is fine-tuned. \u201cMargins are very tight in the business; we had to scout for a factory which is affordable whilst not compromising the quality of the product. We found one a year back, but in mainland Europe. We have been importing over past months, and it has worked really great, with customers loving our product and us not having had any troubles with the supply chain.\u201d His partner Dan said if the company was \u201cshifting massive volumes\u201d it might be able to \u201cride through and hope for the best\u201d but at the moment it is less than a year old and in a delicate startup phase of the business cycle. Dan and Mike agreed to speak out after reading of other small- and medium-sized businesses struggling to work out how they can absorb a no-deal Brexit. They are among many small businesses and entrepreneurs incensed with politicians such as Conservative backbencher Nadine Dorries, who recently said \u201cno deal won\u2019t crash the car\u201d. An online clothing company in Bristol told the Guardian how \u201cBrexit is not a business disrupter, it\u2019s a business bankrupter\u201d but said small businesses were scared to go public because of the abuse they get from Brexiters and others. Another medium-sized firm told the Guardian how Brexit had put up to 25,000 British seasonal jobs in ski resorts and summer activity holidays at risk. These businesses are typical of many in the country who are in despair over the prospect of no deal, according to the Confederation of British Industry. Dan and Mike said they were inspired to launch Moving Beans after reading about the \u201chorrendous amount of waste\u201d caused by Nespresso and other capsule machines, which produce capsules \u201calmost impossible\u201d to recycle. They hoped their product would be a winning formula for those who want the convenience of the coffee capsule machine but are conscious of the waste. But, Dan explained, there is a point at which consumers will not be willing to pay extra for environmentally-friendly products. In the worst case scenario, Moving Beans will concentrate on exporting from its factory in the EU to central Europe rather than selling to the UK. However, this is not what the duo had envisaged. \u201cWe are a company established in the UK and we would like to keep up the momentum here and keep people employed here,\u201d said Dan. But their ultimate goal is to make a difference environmentally as well as to make coffee, so Moving Beans may have to quit Britain if the UK crashes out of the EU and the business is no longer viable. \u201cWe are on a mission to produce great coffee in sustainable way and if that means having to move elsewhere, then so be it. It is something we have discussed and something we will decide on as the Brexit deadline gets closer,\u201d said Dan.

Not to the Boris Johnsons and Jacob Rees-Moggs, of course, nor to the middle-class little-Englanders across the Tory shires \u2013 nor either to the thuggish nationalist bigots of the far right: but to the millions of ordinary working-class voters who saw leaving the EU as a way to improve their lives and finally have their voices heard.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/10/corbyn-says-labour-may-need-to-delay-brexit-if-it-wins-snap-election\">Corbyn says Labour may delay Brexit if it wins snap election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Remember that brief moment after the referendum, when commentators started acknowledging the \u201cleft behind\u201d, admitting that they\u2019d been ignored for far too long? The swaths of the country beyond the M25 where industries had been lost, where communities had been torn apart, and where the idea of prosperity was a long-forgotten dream.</p> <p>What happened? Before long the Westminster village reverted to type, and began obsessing about political plots, obscure article wording, and parliamentary procedures. All the talk switched to meaningful votes \u2013 yet in vast stretches of the UK, what they want is meaningful lives.</p> <p>And amid the panic to stop Brexit, their stories have been forgotten. It often seems the message to them from remainers can be boiled down to two words: \u201cStupid northerners.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s been little attempt to acknowledge the widespread poverty, deprivation, insecurity and marginalisation of so many towns and cities that led them to seek such a drastic solution to their problems. Yes, of course it\u2019s clear that all the predictions are for the economy to take a hit and the poorer, northern regions to take the biggest hit of all: \u201cWhat on earth were you thinking,\u201d the liberal commentariat say (it\u2019s a statement, not a question). Yet they fail to realise that these parts of the country have mostly been untouched by economic growth, even in the so-called boom years.</p> <p>I was born and raised in Hull, a medium-sized, solidly working-class city in east Yorkshire. I remember the Thatcher recession of the 1980s, and the hit the city took, along with the collapse of its fishing industry. I also remember feeling incredulous when the media, over the following years, reported the economic boom: the yuppies, the \u201cbig bang\u201d in the City of London, the \u201cshare-owning democracy\u201d. None of that was felt anywhere near us.</p> <p>And little has changed. The only two regions of the UK that have recovered after the 2008 crash are London and the south-east. So, during the referendum campaign, to raise the economy as a reason for staying in Europe was always likely to fall on deaf ears \u2013 and it did. Yet since 2016, remarkably, most remainers seem to feel that if they keep repeating this message, somehow people will change their minds. It won\u2019t work. Nor will that other continuously repeated phrase: \u201cYou were lied to.\u201d As if leave voters are so gullible they\u2019d believe anything politicians tell them: in fact, they voted Brexit because they totally distrusted politicians. All these remainer arguments do is make people feel their protest vote is being ignored, and that establishment voices just want things to carry on as before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9210921912653aea59341f0afe36f70900a2ec7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9210921912653aea59341f0afe36f70900a2ec7e/816_324_4508_2705/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Activists hold up placards from the Leave Means Leave campaign group outside the Houses of Parliament this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists hold up placards from the Leave Means Leave campaign group outside the Houses of Parliament this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niklas Halle\u2019n/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a great scene in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/04/channel-4s-new-brexit-drama-conceived-the-day-jo-cox-was-killed\" title=\"\">James Graham\u2019s</a> 2017 play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/03/labour-of-love-review-james-graham-comedy-political-party-noel-coward-theatre\" title=\"\">Labour of Love</a>, which centres on a Nottingham Labour MP and his constituency agent, played in its original production by Tamsin Greig. At the end of another long day pounding the streets, trying to show voters how her party can improve their lives, she says wistfully: \u201cWhat a glorious peace, it must be, to be on the Right. To wake up every morning and look around and think \u2013 yeah, this is pretty much how it should be.\u201d The same is true over the EU vote: working-class Brexiters could equally think, \u201cIt must be glorious being a remainer ...\u201d</p> <p>Certainly, few of them are likely to be persuaded by the leading voices in the people\u2019s vote campaign \u2013 almost all wealthy and middle class, and most of them southerners. The same is true of almost all remainer commentators in the media. The notion of the \u201cmetropolitan elite\u201d used to seem like a ridiculous putdown; yet, more and more, it seems to be becoming a truth. \u201cThe people have spoken. The people must be wrong,\u201d seems to be their mantra.</p> <p>And in the face of their impotence over changing hearts and minds, and as Theresa May drives on towards the cliff edge, they turn to the one person they know they can damage: Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t Labour\u2019s leader help us and make all this nightmare end?\u201d they say. It is of little importance to them that Labour, as a national political party, has to listen to the voices of its northern voters; nor that Corbyn has, so far, played a tactically astute game.</p> <p>They forget that in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/general-election-2017\" title=\"\">general election of 2017</a>, less than two years after becoming leader, he gained 3.5 million extra Labour votes (and 1.5 million more than David Cameron had for his majority government in 2015). Corbyn did this backing a soft Brexit. And he did this when there was a clear remain option on the ballot paper \u2013 in the form of the Lib Dems, whose vote bombed. Much as the Labour membership is clearly pro-EU, Corbyn\u2019s stance helped Labour in large parts of the country beyond the south-east \u2013 it held on to all three seats in Hull, a city that voted 68% leave. He correctly judged that, above all, people wanted to be listened to, and for the misery of austerity to end.</p> <p>Of course, this mattered little in the media world \u2013 dominated as it is by Oxbridge graduates, especially at its most senior levels. These are the people who have least to fear from austerity, and the most to lose from leaving Europe; nor do they have to worry about migrants moving in next door or changing their neighbourhoods, taking their jobs or undercutting their wages. To them, the concerns of poorer or working-class areas are irrational, merely evidence of their simple-mindedness. So the commentators demand Labour ditch all connection with its heartlands.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even if Theresa May gets her deal through, she will lose the support of the DUP and provide the prospect of the government losing a no-confidence motion</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be about tactics,\u201d they insist, \u201cit\u2019s about putting the country first.\u201d Yet, conveniently, they forget that Tony Blair used exactly the same strategy for humiliating and discrediting the John Major government during the 1990s. Blair stayed \u201cconstructively ambiguous\u201d over the big European questions of the day \u2013 Maastricht, and joining the euro \u2013 while the Tory prime minister was skewered by his eurosceptic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk\" title=\"\">\u201cbastards\u201d</a>. The only significant difference to today is that the media establishment loved Blair (private school, Oxbridge, centrist \u2013 \u201cone of us\u201d), so they saw his manoeuvrings as the work of a genius. When, in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/21/jeremy-corbyn-labour-policy-leaving-eu\" title=\"\">interview just before Christmas</a>, Corbyn repeated the carefully crafted thinking behind his party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/sep/25/labour-conference-brexit-debate-starmer-increasingly-likely-to-vote-down-mays-brexit-deal-starmer-says-politics-live\" title=\"\">Brexit policy adopted</a> just three months earlier, he was accused of \u201cdefying\u201d his membership. He\u2019s accused of secretly voting in favour of Brexit in 2016 (which goes to prove that you don\u2019t have to be a Trump supporter to believe fake news). And party members are urged to revolt against him.</p> <p>They claim Corbyn is a hopeless leader. But if that was true, the whole Brexit issue would be playing out completely differently. Given May has shown herself to be totally out of her depth, any ambitious Tory leader-in-waiting (and there are several) would have taken her on by now, ousted her, and called a new general election to gain a solid majority and the chance to put through their own kind of Brexit deal.</p> <p>Yet they haven\u2019t. Why not? Because they know Corbyn\u2019s message of ending austerity and taxing the rich still resonates. In fact it\u2019s Corbyn who\u2019s calling for an election, confident he can take his party to victory.

      "bodyText": "The outcome of the 2016 referendum horrified me. Despite my doubts about the European Union as an institution (its remoteness, lack of democracy, and inflexibility in dealing with crises such as the eurozone debt), I was, and remain, convinced that it\u2019s better for nations to work together to deal with problems than apart. Since then, the chaotic fallout of the vote has made Brexit seem even more scary: we have witnessed an unstable government, inept negotiations, early signs of the economic damage to come, and a looming no-deal outcome. So why is it that, almost by the day, I grow more and more sympathetic to the people who voted leave? Not to the Boris Johnsons and Jacob Rees-Moggs, of course, nor to the middle-class little-Englanders across the Tory shires \u2013 nor either to the thuggish nationalist bigots of the far right: but to the millions of ordinary working-class voters who saw leaving the EU as a way to improve their lives and finally have their voices heard. Remember that brief moment after the referendum, when commentators started acknowledging the \u201cleft behind\u201d, admitting that they\u2019d been ignored for far too long? The swaths of the country beyond the M25 where industries had been lost, where communities had been torn apart, and where the idea of prosperity was a long-forgotten dream. What happened? Before long the Westminster village reverted to type, and began obsessing about political plots, obscure article wording, and parliamentary procedures. All the talk switched to meaningful votes \u2013 yet in vast stretches of the UK, what they want is meaningful lives. And amid the panic to stop Brexit, their stories have been forgotten. It often seems the message to them from remainers can be boiled down to two words: \u201cStupid northerners.\u201d There\u2019s been little attempt to acknowledge the widespread poverty, deprivation, insecurity and marginalisation of so many towns and cities that led them to seek such a drastic solution to their problems. Yes, of course it\u2019s clear that all the predictions are for the economy to take a hit and the poorer, northern regions to take the biggest hit of all: \u201cWhat on earth were you thinking,\u201d the liberal commentariat say (it\u2019s a statement, not a question). Yet they fail to realise that these parts of the country have mostly been untouched by economic growth, even in the so-called boom years. I was born and raised in Hull, a medium-sized, solidly working-class city in east Yorkshire. I remember the Thatcher recession of the 1980s, and the hit the city took, along with the collapse of its fishing industry. I also remember feeling incredulous when the media, over the following years, reported the economic boom: the yuppies, the \u201cbig bang\u201d in the City of London, the \u201cshare-owning democracy\u201d. None of that was felt anywhere near us. And little has changed. The only two regions of the UK that have recovered after the 2008 crash are London and the south-east. So, during the referendum campaign, to raise the economy as a reason for staying in Europe was always likely to fall on deaf ears \u2013 and it did. Yet since 2016, remarkably, most remainers seem to feel that if they keep repeating this message, somehow people will change their minds. It won\u2019t work. Nor will that other continuously repeated phrase: \u201cYou were lied to.\u201d As if leave voters are so gullible they\u2019d believe anything politicians tell them: in fact, they voted Brexit because they totally distrusted politicians. All these remainer arguments do is make people feel their protest vote is being ignored, and that establishment voices just want things to carry on as before. There\u2019s a great scene in James Graham\u2019s 2017 play Labour of Love, which centres on a Nottingham Labour MP and his constituency agent, played in its original production by Tamsin Greig. At the end of another long day pounding the streets, trying to show voters how her party can improve their lives, she says wistfully: \u201cWhat a glorious peace, it must be, to be on the Right. To wake up every morning and look around and think \u2013 yeah, this is pretty much how it should be.\u201d The same is true over the EU vote: working-class Brexiters could equally think, \u201cIt must be glorious being a remainer ...\u201d Certainly, few of them are likely to be persuaded by the leading voices in the people\u2019s vote campaign \u2013 almost all wealthy and middle class, and most of them southerners. The same is true of almost all remainer commentators in the media. The notion of the \u201cmetropolitan elite\u201d used to seem like a ridiculous putdown; yet, more and more, it seems to be becoming a truth. \u201cThe people have spoken. The people must be wrong,\u201d seems to be their mantra. And in the face of their impotence over changing hearts and minds, and as Theresa May drives on towards the cliff edge, they turn to the one person they know they can damage: Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cWhy won\u2019t Labour\u2019s leader help us and make all this nightmare end?\u201d they say. It is of little importance to them that Labour, as a national political party, has to listen to the voices of its northern voters; nor that Corbyn has, so far, played a tactically astute game. They forget that in the general election of 2017, less than two years after becoming leader, he gained 3.5 million extra Labour votes (and 1.5 million more than David Cameron had for his majority government in 2015). Corbyn did this backing a soft Brexit. And he did this when there was a clear remain option on the ballot paper \u2013 in the form of the Lib Dems, whose vote bombed. Much as the Labour membership is clearly pro-EU, Corbyn\u2019s stance helped Labour in large parts of the country beyond the south-east \u2013 it held on to all three seats in Hull, a city that voted 68% leave. He correctly judged that, above all, people wanted to be listened to, and for the misery of austerity to end. Of course, this mattered little in the media world \u2013 dominated as it is by Oxbridge graduates, especially at its most senior levels. These are the people who have least to fear from austerity, and the most to lose from leaving Europe; nor do they have to worry about migrants moving in next door or changing their neighbourhoods, taking their jobs or undercutting their wages. To them, the concerns of poorer or working-class areas are irrational, merely evidence of their simple-mindedness. So the commentators demand Labour ditch all connection with its heartlands. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be about tactics,\u201d they insist, \u201cit\u2019s about putting the country first.\u201d Yet, conveniently, they forget that Tony Blair used exactly the same strategy for humiliating and discrediting the John Major government during the 1990s. Blair stayed \u201cconstructively ambiguous\u201d over the big European questions of the day \u2013 Maastricht, and joining the euro \u2013 while the Tory prime minister was skewered by his eurosceptic \u201cbastards\u201d. The only significant difference to today is that the media establishment loved Blair (private school, Oxbridge, centrist \u2013 \u201cone of us\u201d), so they saw his manoeuvrings as the work of a genius. When, in an interview just before Christmas, Corbyn repeated the carefully crafted thinking behind his party\u2019s Brexit policy adopted just three months earlier, he was accused of \u201cdefying\u201d his membership. He\u2019s accused of secretly voting in favour of Brexit in 2016 (which goes to prove that you don\u2019t have to be a Trump supporter to believe fake news). And party members are urged to revolt against him. They claim Corbyn is a hopeless leader. But if that was true, the whole Brexit issue would be playing out completely differently. Given May has shown herself to be totally out of her depth, any ambitious Tory leader-in-waiting (and there are several) would have taken her on by now, ousted her, and called a new general election to gain a solid majority and the chance to put through their own kind of Brexit deal. Yet they haven\u2019t. Why not? Because they know Corbyn\u2019s message of ending austerity and taxing the rich still resonates. In fact it\u2019s Corbyn who\u2019s calling for an election, confident he can take his party to victory. And if he did, who knows what might happen over Brexit? Corbyn, unlike his liberal critics, understands that Brexit is a matter of timing. If you oppose it too soon, you\u2019ll be labelled as someone who never accepted the referendum result, showing contempt for the 17.4 million leave voters. When thousands took to the streets demanding a people\u2019s vote last summer, I couldn\u2019t help thinking that, up north, many leave voters would be digging their heels in even further. Something dramatic has to happen before Labour changes the stance which proved so popular at the last election. The past few weeks have felt like the start of that drama: a dud deal; cabinet resignations; the withdrawal vote pulled at the last minute; a Tory leadership challenge; a parliament asserting itself over the government. In the following days there will be more such moments. If May\u2019s deal is voted on and then defeated, everything will change. Paradoxically, even if May gets her deal through, she will automatically lose the support of the DUP and therefore provide the very real prospect of the government losing a no-confidence motion. (So if Corbyn really was putting his party\u2019s interests above the country\u2019s, he\u2019d back May\u2019s deal and create this very scenario.) Assuming her deal is defeated, this would indeed be a moment for Corbyn to push for an election. And given the calamity of no-deal, which was certainly not on the side of any bus in 2016, it would also be a valid moment to call for a second referendum. Either of these options would provide the potential to alter Britain\u2019s current catastrophic trajectory. I\u2019d back them both. But if I had to choose between an election or a second referendum, I think that ultimately it would have to be for the option that could transform Britain \u2013 rather than the one under which things would remain just the same. \u2022 Joseph Harker is a Guardian deputy opinion editor",

      "body": "<p>\u201cAn olive orchard cultivated in a conventional manner is a bloody wound in nature,\u201d declares Johannes Eisenbach as he drives \u2013 fast \u2013 south along the gleaming new Greek motorways towards Kalamata. The olives are harvested, the branches are burned, and all these nutritional elements leave the olive grove and never return.</p> <p>Eisenbach is an ebullient German with a Bluetooth receiver in his ear, constantly switching between Greek, German and English as he takes calls from big German supermarkets including Lidl. He runs the Organic Marketing &amp; Export Network, a group of 800 Greek and Cypriot organic farmers who sell to northern Europe. He\u2019s also the accidental inventor of a new kind of compost that could kick-start vegan farming.</p> <p>It is dawning on many vegans that although they eschew eating animal products, the fruit, vegetables and cereals they consume are grown with animal manure. Factory-farmed animal waste may contain antibiotic residues but even organic farmers have long argued it is not possible to maintain soil fertility without animal manure. Could Eisenbach\u2019s invention change that?</p> <p>Twenty-three years ago, seeking to better use wasted olive branches on his employer\u2019s Greek farm, Eisenbach began a small trial, mixing olive leaves, olive cake \u2013 the dry residue after olives have been mechanically pressed \u2013 and grape pomace, the leftovers from local vineyards. He produced 80 tonnes of compost, which worked well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0993c2bac39615ced1de82b4148e24d5c10a0b0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0993c2bac39615ced1de82b4148e24d5c10a0b0b/0_0_4000_6000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Johannes Eisenbach\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Johannes Eisenbach photographed at OIKOBIO farm in Makroch\u00f3ri Ver\u00edas, Greece.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Georgios Makkas/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few years later, a crisis in his employer\u2019s business forced him to devote his energies to establishing the organic network. Too busy to sell his compost, Eisenbach grew vegetables on it. He assumed the crops would eventually exhaust the compost. Oddly, however, as the compost aged, his vegetable yields got bigger and bigger.</p> <p>He dispatched old compost for laboratory tests. The lab scientist phoned him, baffled: he\u2019d never seen such strange material. Nitrogen levels were unusually high for a compost; it also held moisture uncharacteristically well and released pure water \u2013 no nitrates washed out as they do with conventional, water-soluble fertilisers.</p> <p>Eisenbach shows me his small plant on the edge of Kalamata where he makes what he calls biocyclic humus soil. There\u2019s one small shed, two employees, and 12 long hummocks of black soil tended by a mini-tractor \u2013 a purpose-built Swiss composter. He first mixes grape pomace, olive leaves and olive cake. The temperature must be above 56C to kill harmful micro-organisms. For a month, the mini-tractor churns the compost like a whisk and adds water daily. For another three months, the compost is turned weekly to enter the first stage of \u201cripeness\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEven with a difficult raw material you can produce a fantastic ripe, balanced compost within five months,\u201d says Eisenbach. \u201cEverybody would say this is a ripe compost. But it is not a ripe compost.\u201d As he accidentally discovered, extra benefits occur when this compost is left to mature for up to four years. In one row of maturing compost, Eisenbach is growing vegetables directly into the humus soil. He picks a lettuce \u2013 it is the size of a large pumpkin.</p> <h2>Demand for \u2018vegan\u2019 fruit and veg</h2> <p>Farmers are rightly suspicious of \u201cmiracle\u201d products but the humus soil is bearing fruit on farms beyond Eisenbach\u2019s compost plant. His work has helped created a new global certification, the <a href=\"http://www.biocyclic-vegan.org/index.html#news\">biocyclic vegan standard</a>, for crops grown only with plant-based fertilisers.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of biocyclic vegan products on the market already but people don\u2019t know that they were actually grown vegan,\u201d says Axel Anders, the Berlin-based coordinator for <a href=\"http://www.biocyclic-vegan.org/\">Biocyclic Vegan Agriculture</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s like organic farming 40 years ago. We experience the same resistance. People say using plant-based composts doesn\u2019t work; even organic farmers have the same attitude.\u201d</p> <p>Farms and fruit orchards in Greece and Cyprus have been among the first to adopt its new certification, growing produce for export to German, Austria and the Netherlands, where there is increasing demand for \u201cvegan\u201d fruit and veg.</p> <p>On the sunny plains of Northern Greece, groves of peaches and nectarines mingle with rectangles planted with potatoes and courgettes. Orange orbs of hokkaido squash ripen as birds sing in thick hedges. A luxuriant field of broccoli dances with scores of large white butterflies.</p> <p>The abundance of bird and insect life is unusual and \u00d3thon Grigori\u00e1dis and his daughter, Stephanie, do not resemble typical farmers. Grigori\u00e1dis is a studious engineer and wears a smart shirt; Stephanie wears luminous trainers and sportswear. Their farm, Oiko Bio, is organic and now has the biocyclic vegan standard too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3aaade8c893d44fff07b680dca24c114b11d691\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3aaade8c893d44fff07b680dca24c114b11d691/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u00d3thon Grigori\u00e1dis,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u00d3thon Grigori\u00e1dis, founder of Oiko Bio farm in Makroch\u00f3ri Ver\u00edas, with a hokkaido squash.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Georgios Makkas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s really remarkable about this \u201cvegan\u201d farm is the size of its vegetables. Organic yields are typically 20-30% lower than farms that use synthetic fertilisers and chemical pesticides. But Oiko Bio has had a spectacular harvest this year. One hokkaido plant has produced nine squashes; plants often produce only two. Stephanie shows me photos of their earlier courgette harvest. She taps her phone for more data. This 0.2-hectare (0.5-acre) field produced 1,500kg of courgette: 7.5 tonnes per hectare. The previous year, on the same field, with similar weather, it was five tonnes.</p> <p>Like most farmers, Stephanie and her father are naturally cautious. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about anything if I don\u2019t see the results,\u201d says Stephanie. Does the biocyclic humus soil really work? \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure, and I see a difference in the broccoli here.\u201d</p> <p>Is there a demand for vegan vegetables? \u201cIn other European countries, maybe,\u201d she smiles. \u201cIn Greece, we are still thinking about vegans. I\u2019m not sure about vegans. In Greece people still eat a lot of meat.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a point reiterated by Dimitrios Bilalis, professor of agronomy at the Agricultural University of Athens. \u201cTen years ago if you said you were vegan in Greece, it was a joke,\u201d he says. Now a third of his students are vegan. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he grins.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bce1eba52225120470798ed251f04a256c0d15c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bce1eba52225120470798ed251f04a256c0d15c9/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Organic hokkaido squash\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Organic hokkaido squash at Oiko Bio farm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Georgios Makkas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bilalis and his colleagues have been studying the qualities of Eisenbach\u2019s humus soil. These include Eisenbach\u2019s daughter, Lydia, who was so interested in her father\u2019s compost she sought to scientifically test its capabilities. Bilalis, Lydia Eisenbach and colleagues measured yields of tomato and sweet potato growing in humus soil, an inorganic fertiliser and a control. Tomatoes\u2019 average marketable yield was 7.95 tonnes per hectare in humus soil compared with 4 tonnes in the plots with the inorganic fertiliser and even less in the control; the sweet potato yield was 24.3 tonnes per hectare in humus soil compared with just 3.2 tonnes in the inorganic fertiliser plot. One of these studies has already been published in a peer-reviewed scientific paper, and the group expects another to be published shortly.</p> <p>What are the constituent parts of biocyclic humus soil and why is it so effective? \u201cThere is not a concrete answer in science,\u201d says Lydia Eisenbach, who since graduating from the Agricultural University of Athens now works alongside her father. \u201cWe don\u2019t know all the chemical substances within this complex of organic matter that is called humus. It\u2019s carbon but it\u2019s not only this.\u201d</p> <p>According to Bilalis, the humus soil contains natural hormones that help root development; crops grown on it have particularly good root architecture, which penetrates the soil more deeply. He believes that the humus soil probably produces similar yields to animal manure fertilisers but he is alive to its additional benefits. Produced on a larger scale, he says, it would better use olive grove and viticulture waste. Its lack of solubility means nitrates won\u2019t wash into and pollute rivers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9023812a4c3e9d3a53df1d8fe2acbc5ab088e0de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9023812a4c3e9d3a53df1d8fe2acbc5ab088e0de/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Organic broccoli\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Organic broccoli at Oiko Bio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Georgios Makkas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is no patent on this humus soil, so why is it not ubiquitous? \u201cAgro-terrorism,\u201d grimaces Bilalis. He argues that big chemical corporations hinder simpler solutions that are better for people, crops and wildlife. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to penetrate the market because the barriers come from big companies. Unfortunately the food we serve in big cities is industrial food \u2013 the fruit has to be the same size, the same colour, like cars.\u201d</p> <p>But there is also a catch. Doesn\u2019t the four years it takes to turn good compost into humus soil make it too expensive for large-scale use? Eisenbach anticipates demand for (expensive) mature humus soil from small-scale urban growers who can cultivate vegetables in rooftop soil bags. But he hopes that conventional organic farmers in his network will buy it as affordable \u201cripe compost\u201d and ripen it on their land. While letting it mature into humus soil, they can grow vegetables in it, so land is not wasted.</p> <p>Can he convince farmers to store it for four years? \u201cWe have to persuade them,\u201d smiles Eisenbach. He considers biocyclic humus soil a kind of open source software, and hopes farmers will test it. He\u2019s convinced it can be produced beyond Greece \u2013 using other plant materials \u2013 as well. \u201cAt the moment we are producing agricultural products looking at nature as our enemy,\u201d he says. \u201cWe try to fight to get fertiliser into the soil. We just have to understand that nature is in favour of us. We will not be perfect because there is nothing more perfect than nature, but we have to imitate nature as closely as possible.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 30 January 2019.

      "bodyText": "\u201cAn olive orchard cultivated in a conventional manner is a bloody wound in nature,\u201d declares Johannes Eisenbach as he drives \u2013 fast \u2013 south along the gleaming new Greek motorways towards Kalamata. The olives are harvested, the branches are burned, and all these nutritional elements leave the olive grove and never return. Eisenbach is an ebullient German with a Bluetooth receiver in his ear, constantly switching between Greek, German and English as he takes calls from big German supermarkets including Lidl. He runs the Organic Marketing &amp; Export Network, a group of 800 Greek and Cypriot organic farmers who sell to northern Europe. He\u2019s also the accidental inventor of a new kind of compost that could kick-start vegan farming. It is dawning on many vegans that although they eschew eating animal products, the fruit, vegetables and cereals they consume are grown with animal manure. Factory-farmed animal waste may contain antibiotic residues but even organic farmers have long argued it is not possible to maintain soil fertility without animal manure. Could Eisenbach\u2019s invention change that? Twenty-three years ago, seeking to better use wasted olive branches on his employer\u2019s Greek farm, Eisenbach began a small trial, mixing olive leaves, olive cake \u2013 the dry residue after olives have been mechanically pressed \u2013 and grape pomace, the leftovers from local vineyards. He produced 80 tonnes of compost, which worked well. A few years later, a crisis in his employer\u2019s business forced him to devote his energies to establishing the organic network. Too busy to sell his compost, Eisenbach grew vegetables on it. He assumed the crops would eventually exhaust the compost. Oddly, however, as the compost aged, his vegetable yields got bigger and bigger. He dispatched old compost for laboratory tests. The lab scientist phoned him, baffled: he\u2019d never seen such strange material. Nitrogen levels were unusually high for a compost; it also held moisture uncharacteristically well and released pure water \u2013 no nitrates washed out as they do with conventional, water-soluble fertilisers. Eisenbach shows me his small plant on the edge of Kalamata where he makes what he calls biocyclic humus soil. There\u2019s one small shed, two employees, and 12 long hummocks of black soil tended by a mini-tractor \u2013 a purpose-built Swiss composter. He first mixes grape pomace, olive leaves and olive cake. The temperature must be above 56C to kill harmful micro-organisms. For a month, the mini-tractor churns the compost like a whisk and adds water daily. For another three months, the compost is turned weekly to enter the first stage of \u201cripeness\u201d. \u201cEven with a difficult raw material you can produce a fantastic ripe, balanced compost within five months,\u201d says Eisenbach. \u201cEverybody would say this is a ripe compost. But it is not a ripe compost.\u201d As he accidentally discovered, extra benefits occur when this compost is left to mature for up to four years. In one row of maturing compost, Eisenbach is growing vegetables directly into the humus soil. He picks a lettuce \u2013 it is the size of a large pumpkin. Demand for \u2018vegan\u2019 fruit and veg Farmers are rightly suspicious of \u201cmiracle\u201d products but the humus soil is bearing fruit on farms beyond Eisenbach\u2019s compost plant. His work has helped created a new global certification, the biocyclic vegan standard, for crops grown only with plant-based fertilisers. \u201cThere are a lot of biocyclic vegan products on the market already but people don\u2019t know that they were actually grown vegan,\u201d says Axel Anders, the Berlin-based coordinator for Biocyclic Vegan Agriculture. \u201cIt\u2019s like organic farming 40 years ago. We experience the same resistance. People say using plant-based composts doesn\u2019t work; even organic farmers have the same attitude.\u201d Farms and fruit orchards in Greece and Cyprus have been among the first to adopt its new certification, growing produce for export to German, Austria and the Netherlands, where there is increasing demand for \u201cvegan\u201d fruit and veg. On the sunny plains of Northern Greece, groves of peaches and nectarines mingle with rectangles planted with potatoes and courgettes. Orange orbs of hokkaido squash ripen as birds sing in thick hedges. A luxuriant field of broccoli dances with scores of large white butterflies. The abundance of bird and insect life is unusual and \u00d3thon Grigori\u00e1dis and his daughter, Stephanie, do not resemble typical farmers. Grigori\u00e1dis is a studious engineer and wears a smart shirt; Stephanie wears luminous trainers and sportswear. Their farm, Oiko Bio, is organic and now has the biocyclic vegan standard too. What\u2019s really remarkable about this \u201cvegan\u201d farm is the size of its vegetables. Organic yields are typically 20-30% lower than farms that use synthetic fertilisers and chemical pesticides. But Oiko Bio has had a spectacular harvest this year. One hokkaido plant has produced nine squashes; plants often produce only two. Stephanie shows me photos of their earlier courgette harvest. She taps her phone for more data. This 0.2-hectare (0.5-acre) field produced 1,500kg of courgette: 7.5 tonnes per hectare. The previous year, on the same field, with similar weather, it was five tonnes. Like most farmers, Stephanie and her father are naturally cautious. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about anything if I don\u2019t see the results,\u201d says Stephanie. Does the biocyclic humus soil really work? \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure, and I see a difference in the broccoli here.\u201d Is there a demand for vegan vegetables? \u201cIn other European countries, maybe,\u201d she smiles. \u201cIn Greece, we are still thinking about vegans. I\u2019m not sure about vegans. In Greece people still eat a lot of meat.\u201d It\u2019s a point reiterated by Dimitrios Bilalis, professor of agronomy at the Agricultural University of Athens. \u201cTen years ago if you said you were vegan in Greece, it was a joke,\u201d he says. Now a third of his students are vegan. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he grins. Bilalis and his colleagues have been studying the qualities of Eisenbach\u2019s humus soil. These include Eisenbach\u2019s daughter, Lydia, who was so interested in her father\u2019s compost she sought to scientifically test its capabilities. Bilalis, Lydia Eisenbach and colleagues measured yields of tomato and sweet potato growing in humus soil, an inorganic fertiliser and a control. Tomatoes\u2019 average marketable yield was 7.95 tonnes per hectare in humus soil compared with 4 tonnes in the plots with the inorganic fertiliser and even less in the control; the sweet potato yield was 24.3 tonnes per hectare in humus soil compared with just 3.2 tonnes in the inorganic fertiliser plot. One of these studies has already been published in a peer-reviewed scientific paper, and the group expects another to be published shortly. What are the constituent parts of biocyclic humus soil and why is it so effective? \u201cThere is not a concrete answer in science,\u201d says Lydia Eisenbach, who since graduating from the Agricultural University of Athens now works alongside her father. \u201cWe don\u2019t know all the chemical substances within this complex of organic matter that is called humus. It\u2019s carbon but it\u2019s not only this.\u201d According to Bilalis, the humus soil contains natural hormones that help root development; crops grown on it have particularly good root architecture, which penetrates the soil more deeply. He believes that the humus soil probably produces similar yields to animal manure fertilisers but he is alive to its additional benefits. Produced on a larger scale, he says, it would better use olive grove and viticulture waste. Its lack of solubility means nitrates won\u2019t wash into and pollute rivers. There is no patent on this humus soil, so why is it not ubiquitous? \u201cAgro-terrorism,\u201d grimaces Bilalis. He argues that big chemical corporations hinder simpler solutions that are better for people, crops and wildlife. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to penetrate the market because the barriers come from big companies. Unfortunately the food we serve in big cities is industrial food \u2013 the fruit has to be the same size, the same colour, like cars.\u201d But there is also a catch. Doesn\u2019t the four years it takes to turn good compost into humus soil make it too expensive for large-scale use? Eisenbach anticipates demand for (expensive) mature humus soil from small-scale urban growers who can cultivate vegetables in rooftop soil bags. But he hopes that conventional organic farmers in his network will buy it as affordable \u201cripe compost\u201d and ripen it on their land. While letting it mature into humus soil, they can grow vegetables in it, so land is not wasted. Can he convince farmers to store it for four years? \u201cWe have to persuade them,\u201d smiles Eisenbach. He considers biocyclic humus soil a kind of open source software, and hopes farmers will test it. He\u2019s convinced it can be produced beyond Greece \u2013 using other plant materials \u2013 as well. \u201cAt the moment we are producing agricultural products looking at nature as our enemy,\u201d he says. \u201cWe try to fight to get fertiliser into the soil. We just have to understand that nature is in favour of us. We will not be perfect because there is nothing more perfect than nature, but we have to imitate nature as closely as possible.\u201d This article was amended on 30 January 2019. An earlier version stated that the studies by Dimitrios Bilalis and his colleagues had already been published in peer-reviewed journals. In fact one study has been published while another is still awaiting publication.",

Leave to rest and cool slightly, then release from the tin and move to a rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the icing. Drain the nuts, put them in a blender with all the other ingredients and blitz until super-smooth. Scrape into a bowl, cover with clingfilm and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.

Mac\u2019n\u2019cheese Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr 10 min Serves 4 For the sauce 1 litre unsweetened oat milk, or similar 300g cauliflower, roughly chopped, leaves kept 1 onion, peeled and finely chopped 4 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed 150g tapioca flour 1 tbsp dijon mustard 1 tbsp nutritional yeast 3 tsp cider vinegar \u00bc tsp turmeric Salt and black pepper 50ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for topping 85g wholemeal spelt flour, or other 400g dried macaroni, wholemeal if possible 6 sprigs herbs (parsley, rosemary, thyme) 40g breadcrumbs To make the cheese sauce, pour the oat milk into a saucepan, then add the cauliflower, onion and half the garlic, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Allow to cool a little, then carefully blend with the tapioca flour, mustard, yeast, vinegar and turmeric. Season to taste. Cook the macaroni in plenty of salted boiling water until only just cooked and still firm to the bite (about half the time stated on the packet). Drain and put to one side. Heat the oil and flour in a heavy-based pan over a low flame, stirring well to make a roux. Add a little of the cauliflower mixture at a time, whisking out the lumps, until it is all incorporated. Bring to a low simmer and cook for a few minutes, or until thickened and stretchy, then season to taste. Add the macaroni and a splash of olive oil, stir to combine, then transfer to a casserole dish about 20cm x 30cm. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Finely chop the herbs and mix into the breadcrumbs with the remaining garlic and a splash of extra-virgin olive oil. Season to taste, then sprinkle over the macaroni and bake for 30 minutes, or until golden on top. Lentil and celeriac shepherd\u2019s pie Prep 20 min Cook 1 hr 20 min Serves 4 400g floury potatoes (eg desiree, russet), roughly diced with the skin on 400g celeriac, washed, root removed, and roughly diced with the skin on Extra-virgin olive oil 5g dried ceps (optional) 1 onion, peeled and finely diced 2 large carrots, finely diced 200g mushrooms, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, roughly peeled and chopped 1 tbsp Marmite 5 sprigs rosemary, leaves picked, roughly chopped 1 tbsp tomato paste 1 x 240g tin green or brown lentils, drained 1 tsp maple syrup 1 tbsp vegan Worcestershire sauce 250ml red wine 100g frozen peas In two pans of salted water, separately bring the potatoes and celeriac to a boil, then simmer gently for about 20 minutes, or until tender. Drain and mash the potatoes with a good glug of oil. Drain the celeriac, keeping the water in a bowl, and blend smooth, adding back some water if necessary. Mix the celeriac with the potato and season well, adding more oil to taste, then put to one side. Soak the ceps, if using, in the remaining celeriac cooking water. Heat a large, heavy-based pan over a medium flame with a glug of oil. Add the onion, carrots and mushrooms, and fry for 10 minutes, or until it begins to caramelise. Stir in the garlic, Marmite, rosemary, tomato paste, lentils, maple syrup and Worcestershire sauce, then add the wine and bring to a boil. Finely dice the soaked ceps, if using, and add them, along with 150ml of the celeriac water, and return to the boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes, or until the mixture is thick and the lentils are just cooked, adding more water if necessary. Season to taste. Heat the oven to 180C (160 fan)/350F/gas 4. Transfer the lentils to a deep 20cm casserole dish and top with the celeriac-potato mix. Bake for 20 minutes, then finish under the grill to get a nice golden top. Jackfruit lasagne Prep 20 min Cook 50 min Serves 4 Light olive oil 400g tin jackfruit, drained (net weight) 1 onion, peeled and grated 1 stick celery, finely diced 1 carrot, peeled and grated 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 tsp dried oregano 1 bay leaf 1 tbsp vegan Worcestershire sauce 1 tbsp Marmite 50ml red wine 1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes \u00bd tbsp maple syrup 6 spelt or wholemeal lasagne sheets \u00bd portion of cheese sauce (see vegan mac\u2019n\u2019cheese recipe above) Heat a large frying pan over a high flame with a glug of oil. Add the jackfruit and fry for five to 10 minutes, stirring regularly until caramelised. Add the onion, celery, carrot, garlic, oregano and bay leaf, and fry for another five minutes, until the vegetables soften and take on some colour. Add the vegan Worcestershire sauce, Marmite and wine, and bring to a boil while stirring. Add the chopped tomatoes and maple syrup and boil for two minutes. Season to taste. Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Pour half the jackfruit mixture into a baking dish. Layer with half of the lasagne sheets, then spread half of the cheese sauce on top of the pasta. Pour the rest of the jackfruit on top and spread it out evenly. Top with the remaining pasta sheets and finish with the remaining cheese sauce, making sure all the pasta is covered. Put in the oven for 25 minutes, or until the pasta is chewy but cooked. Leave to rest for 10 minutes, then serve.",

The same funeral director was priced at \u00a32,086 on beyond.life\u2019s site, which at least gave much more information about the quote. What it was showing was a basic price for funeral director services only, plus another \u00a3750 for the crematorium. A full burial was priced at \u00a33,364.</p> <p>Note that lots of funeral directors with what appears to be a long local history may be part of national chains, such as Dignity.

      "bodyText": "January is a cruel month. More people will die this week than any other week of the year, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics for England and Wales. On average, there are 30% more deaths recorded in the second week of January than during the rest of the year. For the loved ones left behind, the days after a death can be devastating and overwhelming in equal measure. Hundreds of decisions have to be taken: the funeral director, the service, the timing, cremation or burial, the wake, the catering and so on \u2013 and that\u2019s just the immediate stuff. Then there\u2019s the bureaucracy of death: registering the death, certificates, finding the will and beginning to sort out the estate, if there is one. Then add to that the time and effort of sorting out the deceased\u2019s possessions, going through all their paperwork and selling their property. So where do you start? And how do you avoid being exploited at such a tough time? The golden rules Fran Hall at the Good Funeral Guide sets out her golden rules: \u2022 Set your budget and shop around. You can save hundreds of pounds \u2022 Ask a friend to help keep you on track. \u2022 Take charge; don\u2019t pay others to do what you can do yourself. \u2022 A good funeral is what you say and do, not what you spend. \u2022 Do it your way; there are no rules, so follow your heart. How much you should pay But what is the right budget to set? Funeral prices have escalated rapidly in recent years, which has prompted an ongoing Competition and Markets Authority probe. The average cost is now about \u00a34,271, it found, yet by shopping around it\u2019s easy to knock \u00a31,000 off that. There are a number of comparison websites that promise to obtain quotes from local undertakers. These include beyond.life and yourfuneralchoice.com, while Sun Life launched its Funeral Planning Mapper this week. They are useful as a guide to what\u2019s available locally, but don\u2019t rely too heavily on the specific price quoted. For example, Yourfuneralchoice gave us a quote for \u00a31,720 for a funeral director in Hastings, but said it could not guarantee the price. The same funeral director was priced at \u00a32,086 on beyond.life\u2019s site, which at least gave much more information about the quote. What it was showing was a basic price for funeral director services only, plus another \u00a3750 for the crematorium. A full burial was priced at \u00a33,364.

We found in our price test on beyond.life that the Dignity-owned operations charged \u00a33,000 more for a full burial service that the cheapest operator. Hall is scathing about the two big chains, Co-operative Funeralcare and Dignity. \u201cThey are more expensive than we think they ought to be, despite the fact they operate on an industrial scale. Avoid them.\u201d But she adds: \u201cMore funeral directors than you might think are brilliant; some of course are awful. Mostly, the best funeral directors are good independents. They are likely to be less expensive and offer a higher level of personal service.\u201d There are heaps of extra costs A funeral director fee is likely to cover just the mortuary, chapel of rest, coffin, pallbearers and hearse.

Probate can be a lengthy and sometimes fraught process but it doesn\u2019t have to be so. Crucially, do not make the common mistake of simply handing over the job to the bereaved\u2019s bank or family solicitor because you will likely pay huge fees. There are a host of specialists who will do it for less, plus lots of advice on how to do it yourself. Many recently bereaved people report finding doing the paperwork a welcome distraction. Note, if the deceased used a bank to draw up their will and appointed them as a co-executor, ask the bank to step down as executor. If you don\u2019t it will cost thousands of pounds. If the bank refuses to renounce its role, you can apply to the court to remove them. Do I have to use a solicitor? You are under no obligation to use a solicitor but if you do decide to use one, don\u2019t just sign up with the family firm, or the bank, as the charges can be astronomical \u2013 in excess of \u00a340,000 even for a simple estate. It is because most firms operate hourly rates/percentage charging systems. A much better bet is to use a probate brokerage, such as Final Duties, that will find you a solicitor from its approved panel that will undertake probate for a fixed fee. You can phone Final Duties or do an online inquiry. It will charge an upfront fee of \u00a3295 and it earns commission from the one of five or so experienced solicitors it will put you in touch with. It does not get paid any commission if you later pull out, so has a big incentive to find you a good firm. What should you pay a solicitor? For a very basic estate with a few bank accounts, and no inheritance tax to pay, the cost can be \u00a32,500-\u00a33,000. For a more complex estate, which used multiple accounts and with some IHT to pay, you are looking at around \u00a36,000. Every extra layer of complication means extra probate fees. Note after 1 April the government-applied fees structure all changes. Why not do it yourself \u2013 with some legal help? Your cheapest guided route is possibly the \u00a3299 self-help option using the probate service from Which? \u2013 England and Wales only. Users get a 64-page pack and email or phone support for six months from a trained probate specialist. There are timelines to help you keep on track and you will get all the forms necessary to apply for a grant of probate, including examples of complete forms and letter templates. If you have been named as an executor in a will, then you should use Which? legal probate for executors. If there is no will and you are responsible for administering the estate, choose Which? legal probate for administrators. Can I do it all by myself? Yes, and increasing numbers of people are opting to do so. The only thing that might stop you would be a lot of stocks, complex investments, buy-to-lets or inheritance tax problems. You will need a copy of the death certificate for each of the deceased\u2019s assets (eg each bank account, credit card, mortgage etc) and before you can start probate, you will need to register the death. If there is no will, the next of kin should apply to the court for \u201cletters of administration\u201d, also known as a \u201cgrant of administration\u201d. If you cannot find the deceased\u2019s bank, building society or savings accounts, the website My Lost Account can find out where they held an account, although it can take up to three months to trace. You should also claim on any outstanding life or other insurance policies. Fill in the probate application form PA1P yourself, or call the helpline for assistance in filling in the form. Provided there are no complications, it usually takes between four and eight weeks to get a grant of probate after you have submitted the application. Once you totted up the assets, you will need to complete an inheritance tax form to HMRC to see if the estate is liable. If it is below the \u00a3325,000 IHT threshold, use form IHT205, or IHT400 if it is above. To do this you will need to work out how much the estate is worth. You will have to attend a probate interview and swear on oath. There is a mountain of advice online on how to do it yourself \u2013 particularly on the government websites. There is nothing to stop you starting the process, before calling in an expert if it all becomes too much.",

      "body": "<p>The F45 workout schedule looks madly exciting; its website is like an ice-cream counter, tons of different classes with zingy names \u2013 Brooklyn, Panthers, Hollywood, Romans. Plus, they all have groovy graphics and you think, \u201cThis sounds exactly me. I would like to improve my combat prowess while working on my core strength. I want an infamous, 1,000-calorie-burning cardio workout.\u201d They\u2019re on to something, goddamn them. The idea is quite simple \u2013 all the workouts a person could do, boiled into 45 minutes, fancied up with themes \u2013 and through some combination of variety and enthusiasm, they lull you into thinking it\u2019s actually something you want to do.</p> <p>I rejected everything that required a partner (Wingman, which is paired resistance; and 22, which is paired cardio, because I am not here to make friends). Foxtrot is an EPIC (their capitals) cardio workout with two intensity levels: a 45-second set and a 20-second one. The idea is that you are more measured in the longer burst, then go flat out on the shorter one.</p> <p>Picture the scene: you need to do 10 Russian twists (sitting on the floor with your legs up and your back almost straight, putting an imaginary ball to one side, then to the other) and 10 mountain climbers (in a sort of push-up position, then you make a climb-style motion with your legs). It reminds me a little of British Military Fitness: these exercises feel classic, as though they were devised by the Canadian air force around the time they invented planes. The truly distinctive thing about them is how much easier they look when other people are doing them. The very idea that, after 45 seconds, I would start over and do it more vigorously was fanciful.

      "bodyText": "The F45 workout schedule looks madly exciting; its website is like an ice-cream counter, tons of different classes with zingy names \u2013 Brooklyn, Panthers, Hollywood, Romans. Plus, they all have groovy graphics and you think, \u201cThis sounds exactly me. I would like to improve my combat prowess while working on my core strength. I want an infamous, 1,000-calorie-burning cardio workout.\u201d They\u2019re on to something, goddamn them. The idea is quite simple \u2013 all the workouts a person could do, boiled into 45 minutes, fancied up with themes \u2013 and through some combination of variety and enthusiasm, they lull you into thinking it\u2019s actually something you want to do. I rejected everything that required a partner (Wingman, which is paired resistance; and 22, which is paired cardio, because I am not here to make friends). Foxtrot is an EPIC (their capitals) cardio workout with two intensity levels: a 45-second set and a 20-second one. The idea is that you are more measured in the longer burst, then go flat out on the shorter one. Picture the scene: you need to do 10 Russian twists (sitting on the floor with your legs up and your back almost straight, putting an imaginary ball to one side, then to the other) and 10 mountain climbers (in a sort of push-up position, then you make a climb-style motion with your legs). It reminds me a little of British Military Fitness: these exercises feel classic, as though they were devised by the Canadian air force around the time they invented planes. The truly distinctive thing about them is how much easier they look when other people are doing them. The very idea that, after 45 seconds, I would start over and do it more vigorously was fanciful. For the 20-second slot, I was pretending. Jumping jacks, lateral dips, all manner of evil crunching; the main obstacle you\u2019re working with here \u2013 hefting about, buckling under the weight of \u2013 is your own body. I will say one thing for the short burst; at least it stops. The relief of a thing, stopping, occurs more than once a minute. But then it starts again, so you know, swings and roundabouts.

Aquafaba, or bean water (the liquor from cooking pulses), perfectly mimics egg\u2019s ability to trap air (cue vegan meringue), emulsify (vegan mayonnaise), thicken (vegan ice-cream) and bind (vegan meatballs). Beyond that, Lacey Siomos, who blogs at <a href=\"https://avocadosandales.com/\">Avocados and Ales</a>, makes an aquafaba mozzarella that can be sliced, grated and melted \u2013 properties that had eluded previous vegan cheeses. For something that until four years ago was only ever drained down the sink, it\u2019s revolutionary.</p> <h2><strong>Baking</strong></h2> <p>While a dyed-in-the-wool eggs-and-butter baker might blink at the idea of whipping up something edible without using either, there are endless possibilities for plant-based treats, as the entries for flax, aquafaba and yoghurt show. And vegan baking runs the full gamut, from Dana Schultz \u2013 AKA the <a href=\"https://minimalistbaker.com/\">Minimalist Baker</a> \u2013 and her no-fuss no-bakes to <a href=\"https://food52.com/\">Food52</a>\u2019s genius chocolate birthday cake with the super-fluffy frosting.</p> <h2><strong>Cashews</strong></h2> <p>With a neutral flavour profile and rich, built-in creaminess, cashews are key to myriad plant-based takes on non-vegan dishes. When soaked and blended in water, they can be turned into milk, sauces, batters, cheese, creams, icing, caramel \u2026 </p> <h2><strong>Dried fruit</strong></h2> <p>Ready-made snacks, flavour bombs in savoury settings, and natural sweeteners for bakes, puddings and porridge. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/nov/08/from-offal-to-nettles-chefs-on-the-best-underused-ingredients-to-try-at-home\" title=\"\">Many a chef\u2019s secret ingredient</a>, and a must-have in the vegan pantry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"32823613f8e114884eb3c9c4361d0cea92ac355f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32823613f8e114884eb3c9c4361d0cea92ac355f/0_59_3611_3610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bosh! co-founders Henry Firth and Ian Theasby\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Experiment</strong></h2> <p>Vegan cookbook authors <a href=\"https://www.bosh.tv/\" title=\"\">Bosh!</a> best exemplify the DIY creativity that makes vegan cooking so exciting. \u201cYou name it, we can do it.

Some gadgets are definitely worth forking out for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7b8384ef8a883cb64ecf3391633af2813a70b2ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b8384ef8a883cb64ecf3391633af2813a70b2ce/0_312_4160_2496/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the jackfruit, a tropical fruitPDGJGA the jackfruit, a tropical fruit\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Jackfruit</strong></h2> <p>The oversized, fleshy south-east Asian fruit that has pulled-meat aficionados turning vegan. Supermarkets now stock tins of brined pieces, to be turned into the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/21/vegan-jackfruit-tacos-fried-corn-hot-cashew-sauce-recipe-meera-sodha\" title=\"\">Meera Sodha\u2019s tacos with fried corn and hot cashew sauce</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Kombu</strong></h2> <p>While kombu (or edible kelp) is an unparalleled vegan source of umami (try it slow-braised in water with sweet soy: a revelation), plus the vegan-friendly way to make Japanese soup stock (AKA dashi), the other sea plants out there \u2013 from hijiki and nori to dulse and samphire \u2013 are as flavourful as they are nutritious.</p> <h2><strong>Lentils (and other pulses)</strong></h2> <p>The Birkenstocks of the food world, and for good reason: pulses in general are cheap, easy to prepare, a source of goodness and <em>very</em> adaptable (black beans make fab brownies, cannellini a good lemon drizzle cake, and lentils great crisps). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4ceec3ca81d3cf6fd83afffaa916f214ebeaaf8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ceec3ca81d3cf6fd83afffaa916f214ebeaaf8a/20_892_3148_3148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bowl of Japanese miso soup\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Miso</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s possible to follow a soy-free vegan diet, but it\u2019s not easy. Be it umami-rich miso paste, soy sauce and tofu \u2013 with its varieties variously substituting meat, eggs and cream, in contexts both savoury and sweet \u2013 or nutty, freshly blanched edamame as a crunchy snack, the range of soy-based possibilities is superb.</p> <h2><strong>Nutritional yeast</strong></h2> <p>The Bosh! guys call this magic dust. Heat-treated, it won\u2019t ferment your food, unlike the active yeast in beer and bread, but it will boost its flavour with an addictive, nutty, cheesy tang. Buy it in flake form to add to sauces or scatter on traybakes; or blitz with oil, garlic, cayenne pepper and ground cashews, then coat kale leaves to create mind-blowingly good crisps.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b912935340142681cb9d0868955f60f428f6096d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b912935340142681cb9d0868955f60f428f6096d/0_0_3386_3386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sesame and green olive bars\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>On the go</strong></h2> <p>Always, always pack emergency snacks in case you can\u2019t find vegan food wherever you land up.</p> <h2><strong>Protein</strong></h2> <p>The one nutritional prerequisite of the vegan diet about which non-vegans are often the most sceptical, and yet, from pulses and seitan to yeast, grains and seeds, there are good sources of vegetal protein.</p> <h2><strong>Quality (and variety)</strong></h2> <p>Even a seasoned chef such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/dec/14/cooking-science-baking-j-kenji-lopez-alt-tamal-ray-cooks-cook\" title=\"\">J Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt</a> will attest to the new-found culinary pleasure in going vegan, because it forces you to explore the produce aisle like never before. He has blogged about how his consumption of good extra-virgin olive oil has gone up fourfold, and a nascent appreciation for the enormous variety of hot sauces, vinegars, dressings and DIY condiments out there. As with all cooking, your vegan dishes will only ever taste as good as the things you put into them.</p> <h2><strong>Reasons</strong></h2> <p>Meat (and fish, dairy and eggs) is, as L\u00f3pez-Alt puts it, the easy answer to: What\u2019s for dinner? So it\u2019s helpful to be clear about why you want to avoid it \u2013 whether for animal welfare, environmental or health reasons. </p> <h2><strong>Seitan</strong></h2> <p>This east Asian wheat-gluten product is a go-to meat substitute. Some vegans take issue with the idea of wanting to emulate meat-eating in any way. Others embrace how seitan (much like tempeh and hard tofu) can be sliced, marinated, braised, barbecued, stewed and otherwise meatishly handled.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7f9b8e43b34f3948dbb82eb14f05ed573dd36bdc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f9b8e43b34f3948dbb82eb14f05ed573dd36bdc/1610_28_3682_3682/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Garlic-marinated tempeh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Tempeh</strong></h2> <p>Where tofu is coagulated soy milk curds, tempeh is whole cooked soy beans fermented into a savoury \u201ccake\u201d. The flavour is nutty but neutral (like tofu, it can go anywhere you want it to) and the texture pleasingly dense. It\u2019s easy to make, too. You need good-quality soy beans, a starter culture (try a healthfood shop), an airy container (<a href=\"https://www.thekitchn.com/\" title=\"\">Kitchn</a> says perforated zip-top bags do the trick nicely) and a warm spot in which to leave it. Try tempeh charred or finely sliced and fried until crisp. It makes a mean savoury crumble, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cfee68e908a7a6ea8583f8ca9dc607968cc0679a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfee68e908a7a6ea8583f8ca9dc607968cc0679a/0_349_1873_1872/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Derek Sarno, vegan chef\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Umami</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://wickedhealthyfood.com/about/\" title=\"\">Derek Sarno</a>, the US chef behind Tesco\u2019s new plant-based range, says he hasn\u2019t met a mushroom he\u2019s not fond of. And his takes on steak (made with char siu cluster brown mushrooms) and pulled carnitas (smoky and spiked with cumin) prove why: funghi allow you to achieve that savouriness more widely associated with a roast. </p> <h2><strong>Vitamins</strong></h2> <p>NHS guidelines single out calcium, vitamin D, iron and vitamin B12 as the nutrients you have to make sure you get enough of. Find them in pulses, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, dark leafy greens and fortified foodstuffs (though quite what breads, drinks and cereals are fortified with might be problematic \u2013 see xanthan gum below). It may also be worth looking into supplements.</p> <h2><strong>Weight loss</strong></h2> <p>L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2019s first monthly foray into vegan eating saw him lose 4.5kg (10lbs) and 80 points of cholesterol. Within a year of eating only plants \u2013 and a whole lot of exercise \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/20/vegan-experiment-health-diet-ready-meals\" title=\"\">Decca Aitkenhead had lost 18kg (40lb)</a>. Converts to plant-based eating variously speak of clear skin, increased energy levels, eased digestion, and better odds against heart disease and diabetes.</p> <h2><strong>Xanthan gum</strong></h2> <p>An additive commonly used as a thickener, xanthan gum is sometimes made with egg whites, so pay attention to everything that goes into your food. The potential for animal byproducts lies in the most unsuspecting places: fish bladders in beer, anchovy in orange juice, human hair in bread. Cereals don\u2019t always cut it, either, fortified as they often are with lanolin-derived vitamin D. Consult an online guide: the Vegan Society does <a href=\"https://www.vegansociety.com/whats-new/blog/how-avoid-buying-non-vegan-products\" title=\"\">a good one</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fb1021ffeb0abb0e74ee1b8c79e3a0c440981481\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb1021ffeb0abb0e74ee1b8c79e3a0c440981481/84_345_870_870/500.jpg\" alt=\"Parfait of chia pud, coconut yoghurt and green smoothie\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Yoghurt</strong></h2> <p>Super-rich and silken coconut yoghurt makes a superlative substitute for Greek yoghurt. And it\u2019s perfectly possible to make your own: all you need is coconut milk and a probiotic starter. Try it with other milk alternatives, too: <a href=\"https://minimalistbaker.com/how-to-make-coconut-milk/\">see the Minimalist Baker</a>\u2019s nifty how-to.</p> <h2><strong>Za\u2019atar</strong></h2> <p>The herb-and-spice blend most keenly associated with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/series/yotam-ottolenghi-recipes\" title=\"\">Yotam Ottolenghi</a>\u2019s brand of culinary adventure. The name refers to a Middle Eastern herb, but many blends feature dried thyme, oregano or marjoram, or all three, as well as cumin and sumac. Either way, it\u2019ll make your cooking sing.</p>",

Invest You\u2019ll need a decent blender and/or food processor to make your own (potentially cheaper, pleasingly fresher) milk alternatives, nut and seed butters, and tahini; to blend cashews, blitz beans and whip up hidden-veg smoothies (a great way to diversify your vegetal intake). Some gadgets are definitely worth forking out for. Jackfruit The oversized, fleshy south-east Asian fruit that has pulled-meat aficionados turning vegan. Supermarkets now stock tins of brined pieces, to be turned into the likes of Meera Sodha\u2019s tacos with fried corn and hot cashew sauce. Kombu While kombu (or edible kelp) is an unparalleled vegan source of umami (try it slow-braised in water with sweet soy: a revelation), plus the vegan-friendly way to make Japanese soup stock (AKA dashi), the other sea plants out there \u2013 from hijiki and nori to dulse and samphire \u2013 are as flavourful as they are nutritious. Lentils (and other pulses) The Birkenstocks of the food world, and for good reason: pulses in general are cheap, easy to prepare, a source of goodness and very adaptable (black beans make fab brownies, cannellini a good lemon drizzle cake, and lentils great crisps). Miso It\u2019s possible to follow a soy-free vegan diet, but it\u2019s not easy. Be it umami-rich miso paste, soy sauce and tofu \u2013 with its varieties variously substituting meat, eggs and cream, in contexts both savoury and sweet \u2013 or nutty, freshly blanched edamame as a crunchy snack, the range of soy-based possibilities is superb. Nutritional yeast The Bosh! guys call this magic dust. Heat-treated, it won\u2019t ferment your food, unlike the active yeast in beer and bread, but it will boost its flavour with an addictive, nutty, cheesy tang. Buy it in flake form to add to sauces or scatter on traybakes; or blitz with oil, garlic, cayenne pepper and ground cashews, then coat kale leaves to create mind-blowingly good crisps. On the go Always, always pack emergency snacks in case you can\u2019t find vegan food wherever you land up. Protein The one nutritional prerequisite of the vegan diet about which non-vegans are often the most sceptical, and yet, from pulses and seitan to yeast, grains and seeds, there are good sources of vegetal protein. Quality (and variety) Even a seasoned chef such as J Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt will attest to the new-found culinary pleasure in going vegan, because it forces you to explore the produce aisle like never before. He has blogged about how his consumption of good extra-virgin olive oil has gone up fourfold, and a nascent appreciation for the enormous variety of hot sauces, vinegars, dressings and DIY condiments out there. As with all cooking, your vegan dishes will only ever taste as good as the things you put into them. Reasons Meat (and fish, dairy and eggs) is, as L\u00f3pez-Alt puts it, the easy answer to: What\u2019s for dinner? So it\u2019s helpful to be clear about why you want to avoid it \u2013 whether for animal welfare, environmental or health reasons. Seitan This east Asian wheat-gluten product is a go-to meat substitute. Some vegans take issue with the idea of wanting to emulate meat-eating in any way. Others embrace how seitan (much like tempeh and hard tofu) can be sliced, marinated, braised, barbecued, stewed and otherwise meatishly handled. Tempeh Where tofu is coagulated soy milk curds, tempeh is whole cooked soy beans fermented into a savoury \u201ccake\u201d. The flavour is nutty but neutral (like tofu, it can go anywhere you want it to) and the texture pleasingly dense. It\u2019s easy to make, too. You need good-quality soy beans, a starter culture (try a healthfood shop), an airy container (Kitchn says perforated zip-top bags do the trick nicely) and a warm spot in which to leave it. Try tempeh charred or finely sliced and fried until crisp. It makes a mean savoury crumble, too. Umami Derek Sarno, the US chef behind Tesco\u2019s new plant-based range, says he hasn\u2019t met a mushroom he\u2019s not fond of. And his takes on steak (made with char siu cluster brown mushrooms) and pulled carnitas (smoky and spiked with cumin) prove why: funghi allow you to achieve that savouriness more widely associated with a roast. Vitamins NHS guidelines single out calcium, vitamin D, iron and vitamin B12 as the nutrients you have to make sure you get enough of. Find them in pulses, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, dark leafy greens and fortified foodstuffs (though quite what breads, drinks and cereals are fortified with might be problematic \u2013 see xanthan gum below). It may also be worth looking into supplements. Weight loss L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2019s first monthly foray into vegan eating saw him lose 4.5kg (10lbs) and 80 points of cholesterol. Within a year of eating only plants \u2013 and a whole lot of exercise \u2013 Decca Aitkenhead had lost 18kg (40lb). Converts to plant-based eating variously speak of clear skin, increased energy levels, eased digestion, and better odds against heart disease and diabetes. Xanthan gum An additive commonly used as a thickener, xanthan gum is sometimes made with egg whites, so pay attention to everything that goes into your food. The potential for animal byproducts lies in the most unsuspecting places: fish bladders in beer, anchovy in orange juice, human hair in bread. Cereals don\u2019t always cut it, either, fortified as they often are with lanolin-derived vitamin D. Consult an online guide: the Vegan Society does a good one. Yoghurt Super-rich and silken coconut yoghurt makes a superlative substitute for Greek yoghurt. And it\u2019s perfectly possible to make your own: all you need is coconut milk and a probiotic starter. Try it with other milk alternatives, too: see the Minimalist Baker\u2019s nifty how-to. Za\u2019atar The herb-and-spice blend most keenly associated with Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s brand of culinary adventure. The name refers to a Middle Eastern herb, but many blends feature dried thyme, oregano or marjoram, or all three, as well as cumin and sumac. Either way, it\u2019ll make your cooking sing.",

      "bodyText": "At least 11,000 child refugees and their families are facing a weekend of freezing temperatures with no shelter, after torrential rains across Syria\u2019s Idlib province swept away tents and belongings. Aid workers warn there is a real risk people will simply freeze to death as temperatures have already dropped to -1C, amid a shortage of blankets and heating fuel. The shelters of Syrian refugees inside Lebanon have also been battered by high winds, rain and snow this week, according to UNHCR, which says 361 sites have been affected. Camps in the border town of Arsal have been buried in snow, while settlements in the central and west Bekaa areas, where there has been heavy flooding, have experienced even worse damage. It is forecast that rains will begin again on Sunday. On Thursday, the UN confirmed an eight-year-old Syrian girl died in Lebanon after slipping and falling into a river during the storm. In north-west Syria, Save the Children is distributing plastic sheeting to displaced families. Caroline Anning, Syria advocacy and communications manager for the charity, said there were cases of babies freezing to death last year, and added that more people are vulnerable this winter. \u201cThe number of people that moved into Idlib over the last year is huge and there is always the risk there will be more,\u201d said Anning. \u201cWe saw, a couple of months ago, there was an escalation of violence in the south and thousands of people fled northwards. It\u2019s a very tense situation.\u201d Outbreaks of violence between armed groups have delayed emergency relief efforts over recent weeks, she added. Though fighting has subsided, many areas remain cut off as a result of flash floods, preventing families from accessing health facilities and slowing the distribution of emergency supplies. On Wednesday, a woman in labour was carried out of a camp on the shoulders of six people because it was not possible to access roads, Anning said. Aid workers are concerned about the spread of disease in overcrowded camps, and have received anecdotal reports of respiratory illnesses. About half of the 2.9 million people living in Idlib and the surrounding areas are displaced, according to the UN. Children, who make up half of those displaced, have often been forced to move up to seven times and are already in poor health. Save the Children warned that a demilitarised zone set up by Turkey and Russia along the frontline in Idlib must be fully implemented. \u201cThings are so fragile, any further escalation or displacement would just create a huge humanitarian crisis,\u201d said Anning. In Lebanon, 70,000 refugees, including almost 40,000 children, are at risk of extreme weather, according to UNHCR. \u201cIt has stopped raining and snowing now but it\u2019s still very cold and we are expecting another storm starting this Sunday,\u201d said Lisa Abou Khaled, public information officer for UNHCR in Lebanon. \u201cWe are worried that the upcoming storm may cause more damage, especially in informal tented settlements in Bekaa and in the north,\u201d she added.",

I don\u2019t have any friends that are in my situation. Sometimes I do feel quite isolated because sometimes they can\u2019t relate, which is fine.

At school at the time, I wasn\u2019t even able to do a BTec, I wasn\u2019t on that level. So when I started doing music, I put it out there and I was kind of like: \u2018This is going to shock people, I bet they didn\u2019t know I could do this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He starts talking about his ambitions, which, for all the stuff in his songs about \u201ccounting your stacks and making them bounce\u201d, he says are \u201cbasically small\u201d. He recently modelled in a campaign for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jan/16/adidas-eqt-trainers-transport-tickets-berlin\" title=\"\">Adidas</a>, but says he has turned down \u201clike 10 grand\u201d from other companies because he didn\u2019t like the clothes: you can\u2019t sing about looking like a million pounds if you\u2019ll wear any old tat. He has rebuffed attempts by his new label to get him to work with outside songwriters and producers. \u201cI was like: \u2018No, no, no, no!\u2019 I have to focus on making sure they don\u2019t change who I am.\u201d He thinks people who believe his music is a joke are going to be disappointed when they eventually hear his album \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s songs there for my pure fans that just like my voice and especially my instrumentals, so those other people probably won\u2019t enjoy it; \u2018Oh, he\u2019s not saying anything funny\u2019\u201d \u2013 and seems genuinely nonplussed when I tell him I\u2019d assumed Jimothy Lacoste was a kind of character he\u2019d invented. He shakes his head: no, he says, it\u2019s him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just there being me, really.

I don\u2019t have any friends that are in my situation. Sometimes I do feel quite isolated because sometimes they can\u2019t relate, which is fine. At the same time, we\u2019re all humans, we\u2019re all the same.\u201d He says he started making music as \u201cliterally for me to listen to myself in my room\u201d: he was more interested in melodies and arrangements than lyrics because \u201cI used to listen to rap songs, and because of my dyslexia, I wouldn\u2019t know a thing that they were saying, but I\u2019d just love the sound of his or her voice, that kind of melody; I\u2019m more of a sound man, you know?\u201d The videos, meanwhile, were initially made just to show his friends: he enlisted a mate to shoot them, startled him by announcing that the results weren\u2019t right and needed to be completely re-shot, and edited them himself \u201con Movie Maker, this weird free program I downloaded on Google\u201d. \u201cThe music came out of shyness, having a bad time at school, finding a way to express myself and experiment with my emotions and stuff but, at the same time, there was a confidence there that made me put it out: \u2018I think this is amazing, I\u2019m sure other people will find it amazing.\u2019 In my group of friends I was always seen as the dumb one, you know?\u201d he says. \u201cThey would always have this joke, if they saw something a bit amateur, they\u2019d say: \u2018That\u2019s so BTec\u2019. At school at the time, I wasn\u2019t even able to do a BTec, I wasn\u2019t on that level. So when I started doing music, I put it out there and I was kind of like: \u2018This is going to shock people, I bet they didn\u2019t know I could do this.\u2019\u201d He starts talking about his ambitions, which, for all the stuff in his songs about \u201ccounting your stacks and making them bounce\u201d, he says are \u201cbasically small\u201d. He recently modelled in a campaign for Adidas, but says he has turned down \u201clike 10 grand\u201d from other companies because he didn\u2019t like the clothes: you can\u2019t sing about looking like a million pounds if you\u2019ll wear any old tat. He has rebuffed attempts by his new label to get him to work with outside songwriters and producers. \u201cI was like: \u2018No, no, no, no!\u2019 I have to focus on making sure they don\u2019t change who I am.\u201d He thinks people who believe his music is a joke are going to be disappointed when they eventually hear his album \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s songs there for my pure fans that just like my voice and especially my instrumentals, so those other people probably won\u2019t enjoy it; \u2018Oh, he\u2019s not saying anything funny\u2019\u201d \u2013 and seems genuinely nonplussed when I tell him I\u2019d assumed Jimothy Lacoste was a kind of character he\u2019d invented. He shakes his head: no, he says, it\u2019s him. \u201cI\u2019m just there being me, really. In the videos and the live shows, it\u2019s literally like \u2026 my most powerful me, coming out.\u201d Jimothy performs at KOKO, NW1, 14 February",

      "body": "<p>Shortly after celebrating my 30th birthday in 1998, I was driving through Cumbria when I got a call from my father. \u201cSimon\u2019s been murdered \u2013 you need to come home.\u201d</p> <p>Simon was my identical twin brother. It\u2019s hard to describe what happened next. We knew very little, other than the fact that Simon had been beaten up and drowned, and that the police were conducting a murder investigation.</p> <p>About 10 days after Simon\u2019s death, the story had reached the national media; I was set to go on Crimewatch when the police caught his killers. Sixteen years later, I would come face to face with one of these men and find out exactly what had happened, in the most excruciating detail. But at the time it was a case of trying to piece together what had happened that night.</p> <p>Simon had gone to a nightclub with his friends. CCTV showed him leaving alone and heading to stay with a friend who lived nearby. He then bumped into the two young men who would later murder him. Both were previous offenders who were well known in the area; one had been released from a young offender institution that morning. They had been drinking and smoking cannabis all day. Simon had also been drinking, so probably wasn\u2019t fully aware of the danger he might be putting himself into.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"20493b570eacf6d4340d3afcd9c41aa5b277cbb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20493b570eacf6d4340d3afcd9c41aa5b277cbb2/0_0_799_1121/713.jpg\" alt=\"Nick with Simon in Mallorca in 1989\" width=\"713\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick (left) with Simon in Mallorca in 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Nick Dawson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The two men saw an opportunity to rob him. Simon, being Simon, wouldn\u2019t have fought back \u2013 neither of us was like that. He had no money on him, only his cash card, so they beat him to try to get the pin number. They stamped on him and kicked him unconscious. (I remember seeing him in the mortuary afterwards; his head was black and blue.) They then threw him in a nearby pond, where he drowned.</p> <p>The case took almost a year to come to court and was extremely upsetting. When the pathologist described the trauma to Simon\u2019s head, my mum had to run out of the courtroom. Both the accused pleaded not guilty, but the verdict was unanimous. One of the offenders was 19 at the time, and he received a life sentence, of at least 12 years. The other, who was 16, was jailed for at least 10 years.</p> <p>Those early years after the trial were very tough and I had a lot of counselling. My mother suffered from alcoholism as a result. She\u2019s recovered now, but she\u2019s lucky to be alive.</p> <p>During those years, the victim liaison service kept us informed as the offenders passed through the prison system; and, in 2012, we started attending their parole hearings, where we were able to read out our victim impact statements. It was the first time since the trial that we were able to see Simon\u2019s killers and to tell them, face to face, about the impact their actions had had on us; it was a very powerful experience, especially when it came to the younger offender, David.</p> <p>My mother read out her statement first; when I walked in, David was in tears. As I read my statement, I looked him straight in the eye and told him how hurt I was.</p> <p>To us, all those years ago, when David had been sentenced, he was just a 16-year-old low-life who had no understanding of the enormity of what he\u2019d done. Although he was the younger of the two, we felt he was the ringleader.</p> <p>That day in the parole hearing, I saw someone completely different \u2013 a grown man who was trying to recover. He\u2019d spent the best part of his life in jail, and for all those years I\u2019d imagined him to be an evil monster. I realised then that I really wanted to meet and talk to him; I came out that day determined to explore restorative justice.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wanted answers to some of the details around Simon's death \u2013 and I was prepared to go very deep</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In August 2014, the victim liaison officer put me in touch with Mandy and Jenny, two people from victim support who would help me through the process of meeting David. Mum and Dad didn\u2019t want to be a part of it, but supported me nonetheless. My wife was very involved, and she was there on the day. She had never really got to know Simon or had the chance to understand our relationship as twins. That was a loss, and something she needed to express to David.</p> <p>The meeting took place in the prison chapel. There was a circle of chairs and a small, screened-off area in case I needed time out. When Mandy asked if I was ready, I felt tears welling up \u2013 I was very emotional. Then David was brought in.</p> <p>At that stage, I hadn\u2019t even heard his voice. Mandy began by inviting David to talk about what had happened. It took only a minute or two before the conversation began flowing. I talked about my background, Simon, and everything that had led up to that day. I showed David photographs of our 30th birthday, three weeks before Simon died. He spent a lot of time reflecting on them \u2013 we found out after the meeting that the pictures of Simon helped bring home the impact of what he\u2019d done to our family.</p> <p>I wanted to get answers to some of the details about Simon\u2019s death, and I was prepared to go very deep. I also wanted to hear David say how sorry he was \u2013 something that I felt he, too, wanted to express. I made it clear the meeting was not about me forgiving him, because I was not ready to do that (that door may open at some stage in future). It was more about me getting answers to many questions, unknowns that I had reflected on over the last 16 years. </p> <p>Finally, I asked David how he had killed Simon. He looked me in the eye and took me, step by step, through what had happened. He talked about Simon crying and begging them to stop beating him. He said at one point: \u201cI can\u2019t use the word \u2018sorry\u2019 to make up for what I\u2019ve done \u2013 it\u2019s hollow, and it\u2019s got no meaning. I was an evil person when I killed your brother, and I can\u2019t take that away.\u201d</p> <p>I also got a deep insight into David\u2019s background, which helped me understand how damaged he\u2019d been when he killed Simon. It wasn\u2019t an excuse, but it helped partly to explain why he\u2019d come to be where he was that night. He said to me: \u201cI was just so angry \u2013 it wasn\u2019t Simon I was kicking, it could have been anybody.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8061d3d4953857b159df0189734d5135906bf96a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8061d3d4953857b159df0189734d5135906bf96a/41_364_1563_1411/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The twins on their 30th birthday; Simon (on left) was killed shortly afterwards.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"903\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The twins on their 30th birthday; Simon (on left) was killed shortly afterwards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Nick Dawson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I walked out of the prison I was on a high; I felt as if I wanted to go straight into another meeting with David. It was exhausting, though.</p> <p>To get the connection I had with David took time and a willingness to have an open mind. I don\u2019t feel like a victim any more. I\u2019m just a human being who has experienced, and now lives with, the impact of a serious crime on my family. Restorative justice allows you to \u201cclose\u201d and lose the victim tag. The hurt will never go away, of course, but I\u2019ve shown the courage to step up, face and talk to the offender: it\u2019s an incredible piece of closure.</p> <p>As the killers of my brother started to go through the process of being released, I wrestled with the question of whether they deserved a second chance. The older offender was released in 2017, though David remains in prison. Restorative justice helped me understand that all people can make a serious mistake and be given a second chance \u2013 even murderers. Even the murderers of my twin brother. I\u2019ve always thought that I wanted something positive to come out of Simon\u2019s death, and the starting point was saying to David: \u201cIf you can prevent just one family going through what we\u2019ve been through, then that\u2019s a success.\u201d</p> <p>My experiences have spurred me to give back and help others. I now volunteer in prisons as part of <a href=\"http://www.sycamoretree.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the Sycamore Tree programme</a>, where I speak to offenders. My story helps them understand what it\u2019s like to be on the other side, and how much impact and hurt they cause. But it\u2019s also a positive story, in the sense of my meeting with David; and through it, I help them realise that acceptance, understanding and connection is possible on both sides. Simon\u2019s legacy has been to help many offenders recover, and live clean and meaningful lives on release.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>David is a pseudonym; as part of the continuing process of restorative justice between the two men, the writer has agreed not to identify David in the article.

      "bodyText": "Shortly after celebrating my 30th birthday in 1998, I was driving through Cumbria when I got a call from my father. \u201cSimon\u2019s been murdered \u2013 you need to come home.\u201d Simon was my identical twin brother. It\u2019s hard to describe what happened next. We knew very little, other than the fact that Simon had been beaten up and drowned, and that the police were conducting a murder investigation. About 10 days after Simon\u2019s death, the story had reached the national media; I was set to go on Crimewatch when the police caught his killers. Sixteen years later, I would come face to face with one of these men and find out exactly what had happened, in the most excruciating detail. But at the time it was a case of trying to piece together what had happened that night. Simon had gone to a nightclub with his friends. CCTV showed him leaving alone and heading to stay with a friend who lived nearby. He then bumped into the two young men who would later murder him. Both were previous offenders who were well known in the area; one had been released from a young offender institution that morning. They had been drinking and smoking cannabis all day. Simon had also been drinking, so probably wasn\u2019t fully aware of the danger he might be putting himself into. The two men saw an opportunity to rob him. Simon, being Simon, wouldn\u2019t have fought back \u2013 neither of us was like that. He had no money on him, only his cash card, so they beat him to try to get the pin number. They stamped on him and kicked him unconscious. (I remember seeing him in the mortuary afterwards; his head was black and blue.) They then threw him in a nearby pond, where he drowned. The case took almost a year to come to court and was extremely upsetting. When the pathologist described the trauma to Simon\u2019s head, my mum had to run out of the courtroom. Both the accused pleaded not guilty, but the verdict was unanimous. One of the offenders was 19 at the time, and he received a life sentence, of at least 12 years. The other, who was 16, was jailed for at least 10 years. Those early years after the trial were very tough and I had a lot of counselling. My mother suffered from alcoholism as a result. She\u2019s recovered now, but she\u2019s lucky to be alive. During those years, the victim liaison service kept us informed as the offenders passed through the prison system; and, in 2012, we started attending their parole hearings, where we were able to read out our victim impact statements. It was the first time since the trial that we were able to see Simon\u2019s killers and to tell them, face to face, about the impact their actions had had on us; it was a very powerful experience, especially when it came to the younger offender, David. My mother read out her statement first; when I walked in, David was in tears. As I read my statement, I looked him straight in the eye and told him how hurt I was. To us, all those years ago, when David had been sentenced, he was just a 16-year-old low-life who had no understanding of the enormity of what he\u2019d done. Although he was the younger of the two, we felt he was the ringleader. That day in the parole hearing, I saw someone completely different \u2013 a grown man who was trying to recover. He\u2019d spent the best part of his life in jail, and for all those years I\u2019d imagined him to be an evil monster. I realised then that I really wanted to meet and talk to him; I came out that day determined to explore restorative justice. In August 2014, the victim liaison officer put me in touch with Mandy and Jenny, two people from victim support who would help me through the process of meeting David. Mum and Dad didn\u2019t want to be a part of it, but supported me nonetheless. My wife was very involved, and she was there on the day. She had never really got to know Simon or had the chance to understand our relationship as twins. That was a loss, and something she needed to express to David. The meeting took place in the prison chapel. There was a circle of chairs and a small, screened-off area in case I needed time out. When Mandy asked if I was ready, I felt tears welling up \u2013 I was very emotional. Then David was brought in. At that stage, I hadn\u2019t even heard his voice. Mandy began by inviting David to talk about what had happened. It took only a minute or two before the conversation began flowing. I talked about my background, Simon, and everything that had led up to that day. I showed David photographs of our 30th birthday, three weeks before Simon died. He spent a lot of time reflecting on them \u2013 we found out after the meeting that the pictures of Simon helped bring home the impact of what he\u2019d done to our family. I wanted to get answers to some of the details about Simon\u2019s death, and I was prepared to go very deep. I also wanted to hear David say how sorry he was \u2013 something that I felt he, too, wanted to express. I made it clear the meeting was not about me forgiving him, because I was not ready to do that (that door may open at some stage in future). It was more about me getting answers to many questions, unknowns that I had reflected on over the last 16 years. Finally, I asked David how he had killed Simon. He looked me in the eye and took me, step by step, through what had happened. He talked about Simon crying and begging them to stop beating him. He said at one point: \u201cI can\u2019t use the word \u2018sorry\u2019 to make up for what I\u2019ve done \u2013 it\u2019s hollow, and it\u2019s got no meaning. I was an evil person when I killed your brother, and I can\u2019t take that away.\u201d I also got a deep insight into David\u2019s background, which helped me understand how damaged he\u2019d been when he killed Simon. It wasn\u2019t an excuse, but it helped partly to explain why he\u2019d come to be where he was that night. He said to me: \u201cI was just so angry \u2013 it wasn\u2019t Simon I was kicking, it could have been anybody.\u201d When I walked out of the prison I was on a high; I felt as if I wanted to go straight into another meeting with David. It was exhausting, though. To get the connection I had with David took time and a willingness to have an open mind. I don\u2019t feel like a victim any more. I\u2019m just a human being who has experienced, and now lives with, the impact of a serious crime on my family. Restorative justice allows you to \u201cclose\u201d and lose the victim tag. The hurt will never go away, of course, but I\u2019ve shown the courage to step up, face and talk to the offender: it\u2019s an incredible piece of closure. As the killers of my brother started to go through the process of being released, I wrestled with the question of whether they deserved a second chance. The older offender was released in 2017, though David remains in prison. Restorative justice helped me understand that all people can make a serious mistake and be given a second chance \u2013 even murderers. Even the murderers of my twin brother. I\u2019ve always thought that I wanted something positive to come out of Simon\u2019s death, and the starting point was saying to David: \u201cIf you can prevent just one family going through what we\u2019ve been through, then that\u2019s a success.\u201d My experiences have spurred me to give back and help others. I now volunteer in prisons as part of the Sycamore Tree programme, where I speak to offenders. My story helps them understand what it\u2019s like to be on the other side, and how much impact and hurt they cause. But it\u2019s also a positive story, in the sense of my meeting with David; and through it, I help them realise that acceptance, understanding and connection is possible on both sides. Simon\u2019s legacy has been to help many offenders recover, and live clean and meaningful lives on release. \u2022 David is a pseudonym; as part of the continuing process of restorative justice between the two men, the writer has agreed not to identify David in the article.

I can\u2019t really remember much after four negronis and wine but: books, scumbag Tories, coming out. Any awkward moments? Probably when we got kicked out of the house party we crashed. And leaving my knickers behind. I think I also fell over at some point. Good table manners? Excellent, we both spoke with our mouths full. Best thing about Morgan? Her energy, intelligence and sense of humour. And she was up for getting pissed. Would you introduce her to your friends? Absolutely. Describe her in three words Fun, interesting, fit. What do you think she made of you? Maybe that I talked a mile a minute and was a bit overexcited. Also that I am \u201ccool and hot\u201d, because that\u2019s what she said in a text to her friends, sent when I went to the loo. Did you go on somewhere? Yes, to that fateful house party. And... did you kiss? We did. A lot. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? Wear better shoes for a quick getaway. Marks out of 10? 10. Would you meet again? Yeah, next week. Morgan on Joanne What were you hoping for? Someone to break up the week. First impressions? Super tall with really nice eyes. What did you talk about? I can\u2019t wholly remember. Maybe, failing sex education in UK schools and her fairly ugly but sadly estranged cat. Any awkward moments? I walked into a glass wall at one point and my head still has a bump. Good table manners? Who really cares? Best thing about Joanne? She is obscenely fun. Would you introduce her to your friends? Yes, asap. Describe her in three words Tactile, funny, engaging. What do you think she made of you? I think she thought I was really great, because she said she texted her friend that while she was in the bathroom. Did you go on somewhere? Yes, to a house party we weren\u2019t invited to. And... did you kiss? Sure did. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? I\u2019m struggling to come up with anything. Marks out of 10? 10. Would you meet again? Yes. \u2022 Joanne and Morgan ate at Emelia\u2019s Crafted Pasta, London E1. Fancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com.",

      "bodyText": "It is Saturday morning, not early. My wife is about to go out, and I am working at the kitchen table. She walks in and picks up two shopping bags. \u201cPerhaps, while I\u2019m gone, you could clear up in here,\u201d my wife says. I smile apologetically, and indicate the difficult book I am reading, and the pad I am pretending to take notes on. \u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d I say. \u201cOr you could just sit there, while I go out and do everything,\u201d she says. \u201cOK bye,\u201d I say. \u201cGet milk.\u201d I hear the door close, and I put my book down. A minute later I hear the door open and I snatch my book up again. When my wife reappears in the kitchen, I am writing, \u201cWhy is she back?\u201d on my pad. \u201cSomeone\u2019s been rifling through the car,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat?\u201d I say. \u201cThe glove box was open, visors down,\u201d she says. \u201cThey took the pound!\u201d \u201cThe trolley pound?\u201d I say. \u201cAnd my gym card,\u201d she says. \u201cAt least we know they went away disappointed,\u201d I say. \u201cStill,\u201d she says. \u201cI think we should lock the car from now on.\u201d \u201cI always lock the car,\u201d I say. My wife takes the dog to the park and the high street, returning with two full bags of shopping, which she hands to me. \u201cReady, steady, cook!\u201d she says. At this time of year it\u2019s difficult to know how many of my children are home, but by the time I\u2019ve got the chicken in the oven it becomes apparent that we have a full house: the oldest one, last up, enters the kitchen yawning some time after midday. \u201cAt first I thought it was funny about the car, but now I\u2019m cross,\u201d my wife says. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d the oldest one says. \u201cSomeone broke into the car last night,\u201d my wife says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t break in,\u201d I say. \u201cThey were more or less invited.\u201d \u201cI feel violated,\u201d my wife says. \u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cNext week some thief could be impersonating you in a step class.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not about that, or the pound,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just destroys my sense of living in a rural idyll.\u201d \u201cWake up,\u201d I say. \u201cThis is Acton.\u201d But I understand what she means. Since we moved in a year and a half ago, I\u2019ve relaxed into a kind of security complacency. The house came with a sophisticated alarm system, but we\u2019ve never turned it on. I\u2019d stopped worrying about the fact that my children sometimes fail to close the front door, letting the sprung bolt bounce uselessly against the frame. On several occasions a set of keys has been left dangling in the outside lock all night, without consequences.

      "bodyText": "The controversial Tornillo temporary detention facility in west Texas that has housed thousands of migrant children is shutting down, two months after a report warned of \u201cserious safety and health vulnerabilities\u201d at the camp. The Republican congressman Will Hurd, who from early on voiced his opposition to having the facility within his district, was the first to announce the departure of the last group of children on Friday. \u201cI just talked with the management at the Tornillo facility \u2013 the last kid just left. This tent city should never have stood in the first place but it is welcome news that it will be gone,\u201d Hurd announced on Twitter. The former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke said the forthcoming closure showed \u201cthe power of people who showed up for them and shared with the rest of the country that we were locking up immigrant kids for months at a time\u201d. The facility, located adjacent to the Marcelino Serna port of entry on the US border, just south of the town of Tornillo, opened in June to allow the federal government to house a rising number of unaccompanied minors crossing the border. It also housed migrant children who had been separated from their family at the border under the Trump administration\u2019s widely condemned family separation policy, which was rescinded on 20 June. When it first opened its doors, the facility only had room for 400 youths and was only expected to run for a month. After more than three months and a couple of contract extensions, the facility increased its capacity to house up to 2,800 migrants by the end of September. Less than two months ago, Daniel Levinson, the inspector general of the health and human services department, issued a warning about the camp\u2019s lack of criminal background checks for staff and the number of clinicians, among other concerns. By December, pressure from the local community, activists across the country, and the Trump administration\u2019s persistent requests to continue to expand led the site\u2019s operators to refuse to take any more children. Kevin Dinnin, CEO of BCFS, the contractor that ran the site, told Vice News that a big factor in the decision to turn the children away was the federal government\u2019s pre-occupation with expanding capacity rather than uniting the minors with their families. \u201cThe children were coming in but never leaving \u2026 We as an organization finally drew the line,\u201d Dinnin said. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep taking children in and not releasing them.\u201d According to sources, out of the nearly 3,000 minors who were at the shelter in mid-December, the vast majority are expected to be sent to their sponsors in the US, while only a handful of them will be sent to one of the permanent shelters operated by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which keeps custody of unaccompanied minors who enter the country. \u201c[The Tornillo facility] was a symbol of this administration\u2019s deep inhumanity as shown by their willingness to hold tens of thousands of migrant children in detention,\u201d said Fernando Garcia, executive director of the Border Network for Human Rights. \u201cMigrant children and families never should have been separated or held in detention.\u201d Camilo Perez-Bustillo, the director of research and advocacy at Hope Border Institute, interviewed some of the teens who were detained in Tornillo in November. \u201cWhat I noticed about them was their vulnerability and trauma.

Although core government functions such as military capabilities and public pension and health programs remain largely unaffected, many federal agencies have suspended their functions and hundreds of thousands of workers are no longer being paid, including many employees forced to work or risk losing their jobs.</p> <p>With no political solution on the horizon, Trump has warned that the shutdown could last \u201cmonths or even years\u201d. Here is a roundup of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/08/us-government-shutdown-2019-explained\">impacts from the shutdown</a> so far.</p> <h2><strong>Suspended salaries</strong></h2> <p>An estimated 800,000 federal workers have missed at least one and in many cases two paychecks, creating an alarming number of personal crises in the form of missed rent, car or mortgage payments; spoiled credit ratings; lapsed insurance policies; healthcare and childcare conflicts; and in some cases food emergencies.</p> <p>Affected households are mostly on the lower end of the middle-class spectrum, with average take-home pay of about $500 per employee, according to the largest labor union of federal employees. The pinch is keenly felt by African Americans, who fill the ranks of federal employees at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/11/governmnet-shutdown-black-federal-workers-trump-border-wall\">proportions greater</a> than their share of the overall population.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DCist/status/1083818188431937536\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Capital Area Food Bank is holding five free grocery pop ups for furloughed government workers <a href=\"https://t.co/qXj3ijtjeN\">https://t.co/qXj3ijtjeN</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/dgKOa0KaoZ\">pic.twitter.com/dgKOa0KaoZ</a></p>&mdash; DCist (@DCist) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DCist/status/1083818188431937536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 11, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>People affected by the shutdown have established approximately 1,000 fundraisers on the GoFundMe site to help cover their expenses, a spokeswoman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/10/government-shutdown-gofundme-employee-assistance-trump\">told the Guardian</a>.</p> <p>Many workers are required to report to work even though they are not being paid, including those who serve essential functions such as airport security and law enforcement.</p> <h2><strong>Airport </strong><strong>lines</strong></h2> <p>Transportation Security Administration employees are among those whose work is deemed essential, meaning they must continue to report for work \u2013 without pay.

Federal Aviation Administration employees also are required to work without pay, adding stress to the overstretched network of air traffic controllers. Federal aviation safety inspections have ended, the Miami Herald <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/tourism-cruises/article223864750.html\">reported</a>, leading furloughed safety inspectors to warn about a possible safety gap.</p> <h2><strong>Environmental impacts</strong></h2> <p>Pollution inspectors with the Environmental Protection Agency have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/09/epa-government-shutdown-environmental-protection-agency-nightmare\">stopped working</a>, and many routine activities such as checks on regulated businesses, clean-ups of toxic superfund sites and the pursuit of criminal polluters have been <a href=\"https://www.environmentalprotectionnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Effects-of-a-Government-Shutdown-at-EPA.pdf\">paused</a> since 28 December.

Emergency federal aide to compensate mainly for a sharp drop in soybean prices has been suspended, while crucial end-of-year agricultural data will not be released on schedule, creating uncertainty in planning.</p> <h2><strong>Immigration backlog</strong></h2> <p>The shutdown has postponed court hearings for thousands of immigrants, potentially meaning years more of waiting for people asking for asylum in the US and helping others stave off deportation, thus \u201cadding to the very delays the Trump administration has railed against\u201d, the Associated Press <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/21d8b7dad1b94c6a89f2988c0647f260\">has noted</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Suspended science</strong></h2> <p>Scientists working in major federal agencies including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Weather Service have had to suspend research work and have not been able to attend conferences.

The Fema budget has been further endangered by a plan floated by Trump to reallocate emergency funds from disaster relief to build a border wall.</p> <h2><strong>No zoo, no art</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/05/how-the-government-shutdown-affects-museums\">How the government shutdown affects museums</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All branches of the Smithsonian \u2013 17 museums and galleries in Washington DC, the National Zoo, and two museums in New York City \u2013 are closed. That includes destination tourism sites such as the African American Museum, the Air and Space Musuem and the National History Museum.</p> <h2><strong>Security threats</strong></h2> <p>Among the federal employees working without pay are secret service agents, whose responsibilities include protecting the president; federal prison corrections officers; and agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The head of the FBI labor union said the shutdown endangered national security and could make it harder to recruit and retain agents, and could also cause delays at the FBI lab and in getting or renewing security clearances.</p> <h2><strong>Hungry families</strong></h2> <p>The largest federal food aid program \u2013 the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or Snap \u2013 which helps to feed about 40 million Americans, is due to run out of cash by the end of January, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/tsa-government-shutdown-sick-leave.html?module=inline\">reported</a>. A food assistance program serving about 7 million women, infants and children, known as WIC, is suspended. For the time being, state funding has filled the resulting gap in some cases.</p> <h2><strong>Stalled markets</strong></h2> <p>The negative economic impact from the shutdown goes beyond the crippling uncertainty felt by global markets. The Security and Exchange Commission has stopped reviewing loan approval applications for public companies, the federal reserve may be hampered by a data shortage and economists warn that economic growth is threatened.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2032f17c05763bdb1f1e609d110e294311acadb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2032f17c05763bdb1f1e609d110e294311acadb4/0_444_5265_3159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders at the New York Stock Exchange keep an eye on the effects of the federal government shutdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traders at the New York Stock Exchange keep an eye on the effects of the federal government shutdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Tax processing</strong></h2> <p>Fearing a true backlash, Trump gave a special \u2013 and legally dubious \u2013 order for the Internal Revenue Service to continue processing tax refunds, meaning IRS workers are among those required to report for work without pay. But the potential for delays or processing disasters grows as staff resources and morale are stretched.</p> <h2><strong>Stalled home loans</strong></h2> <p>Both the Federal Housing Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs offer federally subsidized home loans \u2013 or they used to. The shutdown has stalled that loan activity, potentially affecting thousands of borrowers. The Navy Federal Credit Union is offering no-interest loans, meanwhile.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/11/governmnet-shutdown-black-federal-workers-trump-border-wall\">'Barely above water': US shutdown hits black federal workers hardest</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Justice delayed</strong></h2> <p>The justice department has requested delays in responding to civil litigation including, for example, a challenge brought by Senate Democrats to the legitimacy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/07/matt-whitaker-jeff-sessions-acting-attorney-general-mueller\">acting attorney general Matt Whitaker</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Tech device hurdle</strong></h2> <p>Telecom companies have <a href=\"https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/telecom-tech-cos-shutdown-threatens-5g-rollout\">warned</a> that a Federal Communications Commission shutdown of its device approval process has threatened the rollout of 5G phone service.

But 69% of Americans say a border wall should not be a priority and according to polling, the public is increasingly blaming Trump for the shutdown. For everyday Americans, the implications of the shutdown grow each day. Although core government functions such as military capabilities and public pension and health programs remain largely unaffected, many federal agencies have suspended their functions and hundreds of thousands of workers are no longer being paid, including many employees forced to work or risk losing their jobs. With no political solution on the horizon, Trump has warned that the shutdown could last \u201cmonths or even years\u201d. Here is a roundup of impacts from the shutdown so far. Suspended salaries An estimated 800,000 federal workers have missed at least one and in many cases two paychecks, creating an alarming number of personal crises in the form of missed rent, car or mortgage payments; spoiled credit ratings; lapsed insurance policies; healthcare and childcare conflicts; and in some cases food emergencies. Affected households are mostly on the lower end of the middle-class spectrum, with average take-home pay of about $500 per employee, according to the largest labor union of federal employees. The pinch is keenly felt by African Americans, who fill the ranks of federal employees at proportions greater than their share of the overall population. People affected by the shutdown have established approximately 1,000 fundraisers on the GoFundMe site to help cover their expenses, a spokeswoman told the Guardian. Many workers are required to report to work even though they are not being paid, including those who serve essential functions such as airport security and law enforcement. Airport lines Transportation Security Administration employees are among those whose work is deemed essential, meaning they must continue to report for work \u2013 without pay. Coincidentally, TSA employees have been calling in sick in unprecedented numbers, the New York Times reported, creating crippling airport backups. The TSA is reportedly \u201cbeginning to close some security checkpoints\u201d. Air travel safety gap? Once through security, the air traveler\u2019s shutdown-related woes are not over. Federal Aviation Administration employees also are required to work without pay, adding stress to the overstretched network of air traffic controllers. Federal aviation safety inspections have ended, the Miami Herald reported, leading furloughed safety inspectors to warn about a possible safety gap. Environmental impacts Pollution inspectors with the Environmental Protection Agency have stopped working, and many routine activities such as checks on regulated businesses, clean-ups of toxic superfund sites and the pursuit of criminal polluters have been paused since 28 December. More than 13,000 employees at the EPA are not at work, with just 794 deemed essential staff undertaking the agency\u2019s duties. Employees are planning a \u201cnational sick day\u201d to protest the shutdown. Eviction threats Millions of Americans who depend on federally subsidized housing run the risk of eviction. Funding for major programs such as Section 8 vouchers, which serves an estimated 5 million Americans in 2.2m households, has lapsed. Health dangers Although the Department of Health and Human Services, which funds the main Medicare and Medicaid health programs, is funded through September, important health programs have lapsed. The Food and Drug Administration has suspended key functions such as routine facility inspections, food recalls and reviews of new pharmaceuticals. A key program for health services for Native Americans has lapsed. Trashed parks While some national parks and monuments have closed, others have remained open with reduced staff, only to witness vandalism, delayed emergency responses and an overflow of trash. Joshua Tree National Park closed earlier this week after officials announced the vandalism of its distinctive namesake plants and other maintenance and sanitation problems. Farmers hurt Farmers reeling from Trump\u2019s trade war with China are further endangered by the shutdown. Emergency federal aide to compensate mainly for a sharp drop in soybean prices has been suspended, while crucial end-of-year agricultural data will not be released on schedule, creating uncertainty in planning. Immigration backlog The shutdown has postponed court hearings for thousands of immigrants, potentially meaning years more of waiting for people asking for asylum in the US and helping others stave off deportation, thus \u201cadding to the very delays the Trump administration has railed against\u201d, the Associated Press has noted. Suspended science Scientists working in major federal agencies including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Weather Service have had to suspend research work and have not been able to attend conferences. The National Science Foundation has suspended reviews of grant proposals. Emergency response The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which helps with emergency response and rebuilding efforts after major natural disasters, has not been able to pay contractors. The Fema budget has been further endangered by a plan floated by Trump to reallocate emergency funds from disaster relief to build a border wall. No zoo, no art All branches of the Smithsonian \u2013 17 museums and galleries in Washington DC, the National Zoo, and two museums in New York City \u2013 are closed. That includes destination tourism sites such as the African American Museum, the Air and Space Musuem and the National History Museum. Security threats Among the federal employees working without pay are secret service agents, whose responsibilities include protecting the president; federal prison corrections officers; and agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The head of the FBI labor union said the shutdown endangered national security and could make it harder to recruit and retain agents, and could also cause delays at the FBI lab and in getting or renewing security clearances. Hungry families The largest federal food aid program \u2013 the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or Snap \u2013 which helps to feed about 40 million Americans, is due to run out of cash by the end of January, the New York Times reported. A food assistance program serving about 7 million women, infants and children, known as WIC, is suspended. For the time being, state funding has filled the resulting gap in some cases. Stalled markets The negative economic impact from the shutdown goes beyond the crippling uncertainty felt by global markets. The Security and Exchange Commission has stopped reviewing loan approval applications for public companies, the federal reserve may be hampered by a data shortage and economists warn that economic growth is threatened. Tax processing Fearing a true backlash, Trump gave a special \u2013 and legally dubious \u2013 order for the Internal Revenue Service to continue processing tax refunds, meaning IRS workers are among those required to report for work without pay. But the potential for delays or processing disasters grows as staff resources and morale are stretched. Stalled home loans Both the Federal Housing Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs offer federally subsidized home loans \u2013 or they used to. The shutdown has stalled that loan activity, potentially affecting thousands of borrowers. The Navy Federal Credit Union is offering no-interest loans, meanwhile. Justice delayed The justice department has requested delays in responding to civil litigation including, for example, a challenge brought by Senate Democrats to the legitimacy of acting attorney general Matt Whitaker. Tech device hurdle Telecom companies have warned that a Federal Communications Commission shutdown of its device approval process has threatened the rollout of 5G phone service. The FCC has also taken down databases including the Electronic Comment Filing System and Universal Licensing System. Beer-mergency The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau receives a whopping 3,000 applications every week for approval for new alcohol labels, which must comply with alcohol content and serving size listing requirements, according to NPR. Those applications currently sit neglected.",

The Australian director of Human Rights Watch, Elaine Pearson, said while it was \u201cfantastic news Rahaf is headed to safety in Canada\u201d, Australian officials should have acted with more urgency to resolve her case. \u201cThe Canadian government seemed to appreciate the urgency of this case, while Australian officials did not \u2013 for whatever reason, Australia was moving too slowly in processing UNHCR\u2019s request,\u201d Pearson said. \u201c[Peter] Dutton\u2019s comments that the case will be considered \u2018in the usual way\u2019 was probably not very comforting for UNHCR, knowing that it can take many months for individuals to be resettled.

Labor and the Greens have welcomed Canada\u2019s decision to grant a visa Qunun. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, confirmed Qunun was granted asylum following a request from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Labor and the Greens welcomed the decision on Saturday, which followed a tense week during which Qunun barricaded herself in an airport hotel room in Bangkok and used social media to draw attention to her plight. She had been on her way to Australia and the Australian government had been assessing an application that was being processed at the time Canada granted her asylum. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased the UNHCR process concluded so quickly and that Ms Mohammed Al-Qunun has been offered asylum,\u201d Shayne Neumann, Labor\u2019s immigration and border protection spokesman, said. \u201cLabor is supportive of any government moves to offer her humanitarian resettlement and we wish Ms Mohammed al-Qunun well.\u201d Nick McKim, the Greens spokesman for immigration, said he was pleased for the teen. But he said the immigration minister, David Coleman, had questions to answer about why the Australian government had taken so long to assess her application when Canada managed to do it in one day. \u201cIt\u2019s great news that Rahaf will get freedom and safety,\u201d McKim said. \u201cWe wish her all the best in Canada, but Mr Coleman needs to explain why Australia was taking so long to process her case. \u201cWe should still offer Rahaf a visa so she has the choice to come here if she wants.\u201d In a statement on Saturday, Coleman said the government welcomed the news that Qunun had been offered a place in Canada. \u201cThe safety of Ms Al-Qunun has always been the Australian Government\u2019s primary concern, and we have been working with the UNHCR and international partners to ensure her claim is assessed appropriately,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the time of the UNHCR\u2019s referral to Canada on January 11, the assessment of Ms Al-Qunun\u2019s case by Australian officials was progressing.\u201d He defended the government saying Australia had \u201cone of the most generous humanitarian programs in the world, and all applications are considered in accordance with Australian law and procedures\u201d. \u201cWe wish Ms Al-Qunun all the best for her future in Canada,\u201d he said.",

The other 99% of toroa live on remote sub-antarctic Chatham Islands and have never been accurately counted or managed, though survey drone flights are planned in the near future. Watts says the 24/7 coverage from the camera has provided valuable insights into the lives of the elusive birds, and has the capacity to ensure more vulnerable chicks reach adulthood. Royalcam, as it is known, has captured the birds arriving at their nests in the night \u2013 which the rangers previously didn\u2019t know they did \u2013 and also recorded dramatic scenes including the chicks first flight and predators such as cats and stoats infiltrating the protected peninsula to kill the nest-bound young. In early 2018 a mother albatross attacked her chick in an unusual and gruesome episode. The death was livestreamed around the world and viewers frantically called the department office in Dunedin, begging the rangers to intervene.

The change will affect around three million households.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The BBC says the annual cost of the free licences is \u00a3745m. They argue that maintaining the status quo would have taken up a fifth of its budget, equal to the total amount it spends on all of BBC Two, BBC Three, BBC Four, the BBC News channel, CBBC and CBeebies.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The corporation has said it will continue to provide TV licences to over-75s who claim pension credit, a means-tested benefit designed to help older people. It estimates this proposal will cost it \u00a3250m a year, requiring some cuts but no channel closures.<br></p>\n    <p>The policy of free TV licences for the over-75s was introduced in 1999 by Labour chancellor, Gordon Brown, with the cost met by the government. However, in 2015 the Conservatives, guided by George Osborne, struck a deal under which the subsidy would be phased out by 2020, with the broadcaster having to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/06/bbc-pay-cost-free-tv-licences-over-75s-fee-deal\">shoulder the cost</a>.</p>\n    <p>The government later gave the BBC responsibility for deciding what to do about the benefit, meaning any unpopular decisions on charging over-75s had to be made by the BBC rather than ministers.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jim-waterson\"><b>Jim Waterson</b></a>,&nbsp;<i>Media editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The corporation also commissioned research pointing out many older people are wealthier than in previous generations, although its consultation admits some may be put at higher risk of social isolation if they lose access to free television.</p> \n<p>The former prime minister Gordon Brown, who introduced the benefit while chancellor, has strongly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/02/theresa-may-tv-licence-elderly\">opposed any change</a> and pointed out the 2017 Conservative manifesto included a pledge to maintain the free TV licence.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/02/theresa-may-tv-licence-elderly\">Theresa May has broken her promise to the over-75s | Gordon Brown</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Reintroducing the TV licence for over-75s could also result in people in their 80s and 90s being prosecuted for failure to pay the licence fee, with potential prison sentences for those unable to pay.</p> \n<p>One proposal is to introduce a discount rate for over-75s or take income into account, but Age UK also warned against means-testing the benefit amid fears vulnerable pensioners could fail to apply for such a discount.</p> \n<p>The average BBC One viewer is now in their 60s, while the ageing audience for many BBC services means an increasingly large proportion of consumers will receive the corporation\u2019s services free unless a change is made.</p> \n<p>The BBC is also facing the need to redirect funding to attract younger audiences, who are less likely to consume the broadcaster\u2019s content, especially in the face of competition from deep-pocketed rivals such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/oct/13/netflix-amazon-battle-rejoins-tv-biggest-stars-romanoffs-making-a-murderer\">Netflix and Amazon Prime</a>.</p> \n<p>A BBC spokesman said: \u201cFree TV licences for people over 75 are expected to cost \u00a3745m a year by 2021-22, and government funding for the scheme ends in June 2020. This is a really important issue. We\u2019re conscious that pensioner poverty is still an issue for some older people.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have set out a range of options in our consultation \u2013 each has merits and consequences, with implications for the future of the BBC and for everyone, including older people.

The broadcaster opened a consultation last year on whether to start charging older people the \u00a3150.50-a-year fee, but the charity said such a move could distress many older people, \u201cpotentially forcing them to cut back on other essentials such as heating and food in order to remain informed, entertained, stimulated and connected to the world beyond their doorstep\u201d. Age UK calculated that forcing over-75s to start paying for BBC services could hit disposable incomes and leave tens of thousands of households facing a choice between being able to watch television or being pushed into relative poverty, which is defined as households with less 60% of median household income. \u201cContrary to the stereotype suggesting that everyone in later life is well-heeled, the reality is that most are living on quite modest incomes, particularly as you go higher up the age range,\u201d said Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK. Free TV licences for the over-75s were introduced by the last Labour government in 2000 in an attempt to reduce pensioner poverty, under an arrangement that saw the government directly compensate the BBC for lost revenue from public funds. However, under a deal struck by the Conservatives in 2015, the BBC agreed to pick up the bill, a move that saved the government money but left the broadcaster facing a substantial extra cost burden of about \u00a3750m a year. Although the BBC has publicly insisted it was keeping an open mind pending the results of the consultation, the corporation made it clear it would have to make enormous cuts to its programming budget and possibly close channels if it continued to provide services free to over-75s. The corporation also commissioned research pointing out many older people are wealthier than in previous generations, although its consultation admits some may be put at higher risk of social isolation if they lose access to free television. The former prime minister Gordon Brown, who introduced the benefit while chancellor, has strongly opposed any change and pointed out the 2017 Conservative manifesto included a pledge to maintain the free TV licence. Reintroducing the TV licence for over-75s could also result in people in their 80s and 90s being prosecuted for failure to pay the licence fee, with potential prison sentences for those unable to pay. One proposal is to introduce a discount rate for over-75s or take income into account, but Age UK also warned against means-testing the benefit amid fears vulnerable pensioners could fail to apply for such a discount. The average BBC One viewer is now in their 60s, while the ageing audience for many BBC services means an increasingly large proportion of consumers will receive the corporation\u2019s services free unless a change is made. The BBC is also facing the need to redirect funding to attract younger audiences, who are less likely to consume the broadcaster\u2019s content, especially in the face of competition from deep-pocketed rivals such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. A BBC spokesman said: \u201cFree TV licences for people over 75 are expected to cost \u00a3745m a year by 2021-22, and government funding for the scheme ends in June 2020. This is a really important issue. We\u2019re conscious that pensioner poverty is still an issue for some older people. \u201cWe have set out a range of options in our consultation \u2013 each has merits and consequences, with implications for the future of the BBC and for everyone, including older people. We need to hear everyone\u2019s views to help the BBC make the best and fairest decision.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The proportion of students in schools for excluded pupils in inner London is almost double the national rate, according to new analysis which raises concerns over the increasing exclusion rates from schools in England. Research found that one in 116 pupils in the 13 inner city boroughs of the capital are in schools for excluded students \u2013 rising to one in 54 in one London borough, compared with the national figure of one in 196 pupils. The rate was calculated by looking at headcount of students in pupil referral units as a proportion of all secondary school pupils. This latest research was carried out by a new education charity called The Difference, set up to train a new generation of specialist teachers to help stem the flow of excluded pupils out of mainstream schools, first in London and then across England. Kiran Gill, charity founder and fellow of the Institute for Public Policy Research, said: \u201cI think we need to ask seriously whether the London story of school improvement has left some of the most vulnerable behind.\u201d London\u2019s schools are among the highest performing in the country, having undergone a radical transformation as a result of the London Challenge programme which saw huge improvements in the capital\u2019s schools between 2003 and 2011. However experts in the sector are concerned about the proportion of pupils who end up leaving high-achieving mainstream schools in inner London and moving into pupil referral units (PRUs) or other alternative provision (AP) for excluded students. School exclusion rates in England are coming under increasing scrutiny from government and the schools watchdog Ofsted. Last year saw the third successive annual increase, which ministers acknowledge is a concern, though they point out the numbers are still far fewer than the peak 10 years ago. According to official government data, Blackpool has the highest proportion of students in schools for excluded children with one in every 30 secondary school pupils in a PRU \u2013 or 3.3% \u2013 which is six and half times the national average. But many of the inner London boroughs are among those with the highest proportions in England \u2013 in Kensington &amp; Chelsea it is one in 54 pupils in a PRU (1.8%), in Islington, it is one in 65 (1.5%), in Camden one in 76 (1.3%) and in Haringey one in 84 (1.2%).
