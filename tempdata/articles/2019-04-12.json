      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond has played down the possibility that the UK could use the delay to Brexit to hold a second referendum and stressed that he still expects Britain to leave the European Union. Speaking in Washington, the chancellor said time would be too tight to hold a confirmatory vote before the new deadline of the end of October unless it was triggered over the coming weeks. Hammond said the damage caused by continued uncertainty \u2013 including problems attracting suitable candidates to replace Mark Carney as the governor of the Bank of England \u2013 meant it was vital that the Brexit issue was resolved as quickly as possible. The chancellor was speaking as cross-party talks continued in Westminster.

Asked whether he had raised the prospect of a referendum on Brexit, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s always on the table of course, we raise that at each meeting.\u201d Some Labour MPs, including Clive Lewis, who is a member of McDonnell\u2019s shadow Treasury team, are adamant the party should not sign up to any deal without a confirmatory vote attached. \u201cAny Brexit deal passed through parliament must be ratified by a public vote \u2013 this has to be the bottom line of negotiations, no ifs no buts,\u201d Lewis wrote in his local paper, the Eastern Daily Press, on Friday. Hammond warned continued Brexit deadlock would put at risk his plan to announce the results of a long-term spending review in the autumn budget \u2013 previously billed as the \u201cend of austerity\u201d. \u201cIf we get a deal through parliament in the next few weeks I expect to conduct a full three-year spending review of resource spending and a longer review of capital spending,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get a deal done, it probably makes it inappropriate to do a long-term spending review.\u201d The chancellor warned that Brexit had damaged Britain\u2019s reputation as a place to do business.

Noting that it would take six months to organise a referendum, he added: \u201cIt is unlikely, at a technical level, whether there would be enough time. \u201cI know some papers have been saying that the EU gave us an October extension so there would be time for a confirmatory referendum but if that had been the motive they would have given us longer.

Jeremy Corbyn will seek to gloss over his party\u2019s divisions on Brexit in a speech in Wales on Saturday. In phrases reminiscent of Theresa May\u2019s Downing Street statement blaming MPs\u2019 squabbling for the failure of her Brexit deal, the Labour leader will express sympathy with voters who are exasperated with the \u201carcane procedure\u201d and \u201calien language\u201d of Westminster politics. \u201cReal politics comes from the ground up.

The cabinet ministers David Lidington and Michael Gove are holding talks with Labour\u2019s John McDonnell to try to reach a compromise on May\u2019s deal. If the sides cannot agree, the government hopes they can at least decide on a process of indicative votes or the path for the withdrawal agreement bill as a way to try to find a parliamentary consensus.</p> <h2>15 April</h2> <p>The UK will need to publish notices for EU elections the prime minister has said she is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/09/conditions-for-short-brexit-delay-have-not-been-met-says-berlin\">determined not to hold</a>.</p> <h2>23 April</h2> <p>MPs return to parliament after Easter recess. This is the week in which a new parliamentary process could begin in an attempt to find a consensus \u2013 whether by new indicative votes or the government introducing the bill, which MPs could amend, either to add a confirmatory referendum or soft Brexit options such as a customs union.</p> <h2>25 April</h2> <p>The closing date for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/11/conservative-mps-may-boycott-european-election-campaign\">European parliament elections nominations</a> and candidate lists.</p> <h2>2 May</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/21/labour-launch-local-elections-campaign-with-focus-tory-funding-cuts-stoke-on-trent\">Local elections take place</a> across England and Northern Ireland.

From the limited amount of polling that has been carried out so far, Labour is currently ahead, with significant vote shares likely for smaller parties.</p> <h2>27 May</h2> <p>May would probably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/11/theresa-may-will-face-pressure-to-quit-from-brexiters-over-delay\">need to quit this week</a> in order for a new leader to be in place by summer recess.

Britain will remain a member state of the EU until 31 October, with the option to leave earlier if the prime minister can secure House of Commons support for her Brexit deal. Here are some of the key upcoming dates in the political calendar. 12 April Parliament is in recess. The cabinet ministers David Lidington and Michael Gove are holding talks with Labour\u2019s John McDonnell to try to reach a compromise on May\u2019s deal. If the sides cannot agree, the government hopes they can at least decide on a process of indicative votes or the path for the withdrawal agreement bill as a way to try to find a parliamentary consensus. 15 April The UK will need to publish notices for EU elections the prime minister has said she is determined not to hold. 23 April MPs return to parliament after Easter recess. This is the week in which a new parliamentary process could begin in an attempt to find a consensus \u2013 whether by new indicative votes or the government introducing the bill, which MPs could amend, either to add a confirmatory referendum or soft Brexit options such as a customs union. 25 April The closing date for European parliament elections nominations and candidate lists. 2 May Local elections take place across England and Northern Ireland. The Conservative party has said it is expecting poor results. The Liberal Democrats are expected to kickstart their contest to replace Vince Cable as leader after the polls. 9 May EU leaders will hold a summit on the future of Europe in Sibiu, Romania \u2013 an event that was supposed to spell out the bloc\u2019s post-Brexit future. May has agreed not to attend. Mid-May The approximate time legislation for any second referendum would need to begin passing through the Houses of Parliament, according to Alan Renwick, the deputy director of the Constitution Unit at University College London. 22 May The final day on which MPs could pass a withdrawal deal and avoid holding European parliament elections. 23 May European parliament elections take place across the UK and the rest of the EU, with any campaign likely to be dominated in the UK by smaller protest parties including Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party and Ukip, as well as Change UK. 26 May Results are declared from 10pm, with the Conservatives expecting massive losses. From the limited amount of polling that has been carried out so far, Labour is currently ahead, with significant vote shares likely for smaller parties. 27 May May would probably need to quit this week in order for a new leader to be in place by summer recess. However, this could technically take place later because only a fortnight would be required for MPs to vote on leadership candidates. 30 May \u2013 11 June The Commons would probably be due to go on a short Whitsun recess, which would be cancelled if the prime minister is still attempting to pass a Brexit deal, in order to prevent new MEPs from having to take their seats in the European parliament. 20-21 June EU leaders will assess the progress Britain has made over the past few months at a European council summit. 28-29 June May, along with EU and world leaders, is due to attend a G20 summit in Osaka. When the prime minister pledged to Tory MPs that she would stand down, she had planned this to be her final overseas summit. 30 June The date past which May said she would not countenance the UK staying in the EU, and the day before MEPs must take their seats in the European parliament. 2 July New MEPs sit at the inaugural session of the new European parliament. 25 July The rough date on which the Commons would be expected to rise for summer recess, and the date by which the party would, ideally, like a new Conservative leader to be installed if a contest took place. Mid-August The approximate time by which the prime minister would need to call a general election to be held before the article 50 extension expires \u2013 in order to meet the requirements of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011, and also the timetable set out in the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013, which requires 25 working days for an election campaign. 25-27 August The prime minister is due to attend a G7 summit in Biarritz, France. 5-12 September This is the date on which the Commons would be likely to return from summer recess, bar any early recall of MPs to deal with Brexit crises. 22 September \u2013 2 October The Labour and Conservative party conferences are held on consecutive weeks. 8 October The date MPs would return to parliament, 18 working days before the UK would be due to leave the EU. 10 October The last practical polling date on which a prime minister could hold a general election or second referendum \u2013 the final Thursday before the next European council. The Electoral Commission is suggesting it would need 10 weeks to organise a poll, as set out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, and that there would be a campaign of at least four weeks. In practice, a change of policy or government this late in the timetable would be likely to require a further extension if a radical change of direction is expected. 17-18 October EU leaders meet for the final European council summit before the UK\u2019s extension is due to expire. 31 October The six-month article 50 extension will expire. 12 December The next date on which Tory MPs can hold a confidence vote in May, if she remains at the helm.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>I was rather nonplussed to learn that Prince William had been doing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/07/prince-william-interns-mi5-mi6-gchq-on-her-majestys-secret-service\">work experience</a> with the intelligence services and, according to the GCHQ head of counter-terrorism, identified only as David, \u201ccomfortably held his own with highly skilled analysts and operators\u201d.</p> <p>Not just because our future king is clearly something of a genius if he can, in a matter of a few hours, master tasks for which some of the country\u2019s brightest graduates take years of training, but also because I\u2019d always imagined that one of the prerequisites for the intelligence services was an ability to blend into the background. Not something that comes easily to a man who seldom travels without several members of staff and is invariably greeted by large crowds wherever he goes. But just maybe MI5 and MI6 are on to something.</p> <p>With William you would have an agent who was hiding in plain sight. Just imagine how time-consuming it must be trying to get your undercover operatives up close to high-profile targets. Years of tradecraft, only for the whole operation to fall apart when someone forgets a dead-letter drop. With William, you bypass all those problems. All he has to do is make one phone call and he gets a one to one with anyone in the world \u2013 from celebrities and oligarchs to dictators and presidents. And no one would think of searching him for weapons or bugs ahead of his audience, so he could literally get away with anything. Even murder. After all, if an undesirable world leader was to be found dead of \u201ca heart attack\u201d, no one would dare come out and openly accuse the prince of killing him. Watch this space.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>One of the advantages of being fairly disorganised is that sometimes you pleasantly surprise yourself. Last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/05/uk-yet-to-leave-but-brexit-has-separated-me-from-myself\">I wrote</a> that Brexit had forced me to give up my ticket to see Spurs play Manchester City in the Champions League quarter-finals. This would have been true, had the game been played on Wednesday, as I had imagined, rather than Tuesday. So an hour before kick-off I did, after all, get to meet my friend Matthew at Seven Sisters station so we could walk up Tottenham High Road together. He immediately declared he had been feeling sick with anxiety about the game since waking up that morning. \u201cIs this what it is like to be you every day?\u201d he asked. I said that sounded about right. \u201cWhat a nightmare. I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not you,\u201d he added, charmingly.</p> <p>As it happened, I was actually feeling rather relaxed about the match, as I was expecting to lose comfortably and had already made plans to sell on my tickets for the return leg in Manchester next week. There\u2019s nothing like the certainty of defeat to ease the tension. That all changed as the game got under way and Spurs began to do more than hold their own. By half-time I was a full-on wreck and when Son Heung-min <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/09/tottenham-hotspur-manchester-city-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report\">scored a late winner</a>, I was probably the only Tottenham fan in the entire stadium who thought, \u201cOh shit. That means I am going to have to make a 400-mile round trip next week that\u2019s almost certain to end in disappointment.\u201d My ability to spoil things sometimes even takes me by surprise. My therapist once described me as the second most self-destructive man she had ever met. I\u2019m still wondering who the most self-destructive man is.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>A morning Eurostar found me back in Brussels for the emergency European council <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/10/may-signals-she-would-accept-eu-offer-of-longer-brexit-delay\">Brexit summit</a>. Where I soon got lost as the buildings that make up the European commission are so large they almost count as their own ecosystem. With a lot of help, I eventually navigated myself past the vast semi-circular red carpet where all the EU leaders do their arrival TV clips and found my way to the overheated side room that the British press had been allocated. Where we all waited \u2013 and waited \u2013 for people inside the room where the EU leaders were meeting to text details of what was going on to trusted media contacts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/11/brexit-may-insists-uk-can-still-exit-eu-by-end-of-next-month\">May tells MPs 'swift decisions' on Brexit will be needed after recess</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The early signs were that Theresa May\u2019s presentation had been better received than the one she had given two weeks earlier, but she had rather struggled when asked just what she hoped to achieve with a longer extension. A question you\u2019d have thought she might have seen coming and prepared a more convincing reply than, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. There again, I\u2019m no one to talk, as at one of the few work interviews I managed to get during the lost decade of my 20s, when asked why I wanted the job, I replied, \u201cI don\u2019t really\u201d.</p> <p>Amazingly I didn\u2019t get the job. It then turned out that Emmanuel Macron, who has one eye on the French far right parties in the forthcoming European elections, had chosen to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/11/macrons-tough-guy-stance-on-brexit-is-part-of-his-political-project\">play hardball</a>. This was Brexit as absurdist performance art, with May asking for a 30 June deadline that she didn\u2019t want and Macron offering her a 30 June deadline that he didn\u2019t want to give as France would suffer from a no-deal scenario. Inevitably the EU 27 finally settled on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/11/its-a-halloween-brexit-european-media-give-their-verdict\">compromise of Halloween</a>. A fitting outcome for a zombie prime minister, but one that actually suited no one.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s been reported that David Cameron has had to scale back on some of the pre-publicity for his memoirs that are scheduled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/11/david-cameron-memoir-autumn-publication-william-collins-brexit-extension-theresa-may\">for October</a>, due to the entirely foreseeable delay to the UK leaving the EU on 29 March as had originally been planned.</p> <p>The official line is that he and his minders feel it would not be appropriate for him to do anything that might complicate the prime minister\u2019s job as she tries to come up with a Brexit deal that can win a majority in parliament.

      "bodyText": "Monday I was rather nonplussed to learn that Prince William had been doing work experience with the intelligence services and, according to the GCHQ head of counter-terrorism, identified only as David, \u201ccomfortably held his own with highly skilled analysts and operators\u201d. Not just because our future king is clearly something of a genius if he can, in a matter of a few hours, master tasks for which some of the country\u2019s brightest graduates take years of training, but also because I\u2019d always imagined that one of the prerequisites for the intelligence services was an ability to blend into the background. Not something that comes easily to a man who seldom travels without several members of staff and is invariably greeted by large crowds wherever he goes. But just maybe MI5 and MI6 are on to something. With William you would have an agent who was hiding in plain sight. Just imagine how time-consuming it must be trying to get your undercover operatives up close to high-profile targets. Years of tradecraft, only for the whole operation to fall apart when someone forgets a dead-letter drop. With William, you bypass all those problems. All he has to do is make one phone call and he gets a one to one with anyone in the world \u2013 from celebrities and oligarchs to dictators and presidents. And no one would think of searching him for weapons or bugs ahead of his audience, so he could literally get away with anything. Even murder. After all, if an undesirable world leader was to be found dead of \u201ca heart attack\u201d, no one would dare come out and openly accuse the prince of killing him. Watch this space. Tuesday One of the advantages of being fairly disorganised is that sometimes you pleasantly surprise yourself. Last week I wrote that Brexit had forced me to give up my ticket to see Spurs play Manchester City in the Champions League quarter-finals. This would have been true, had the game been played on Wednesday, as I had imagined, rather than Tuesday. So an hour before kick-off I did, after all, get to meet my friend Matthew at Seven Sisters station so we could walk up Tottenham High Road together. He immediately declared he had been feeling sick with anxiety about the game since waking up that morning. \u201cIs this what it is like to be you every day?\u201d he asked. I said that sounded about right. \u201cWhat a nightmare. I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not you,\u201d he added, charmingly. As it happened, I was actually feeling rather relaxed about the match, as I was expecting to lose comfortably and had already made plans to sell on my tickets for the return leg in Manchester next week. There\u2019s nothing like the certainty of defeat to ease the tension. That all changed as the game got under way and Spurs began to do more than hold their own. By half-time I was a full-on wreck and when Son Heung-min scored a late winner, I was probably the only Tottenham fan in the entire stadium who thought, \u201cOh shit. That means I am going to have to make a 400-mile round trip next week that\u2019s almost certain to end in disappointment.\u201d My ability to spoil things sometimes even takes me by surprise. My therapist once described me as the second most self-destructive man she had ever met. I\u2019m still wondering who the most self-destructive man is. Wednesday A morning Eurostar found me back in Brussels for the emergency European council Brexit summit. Where I soon got lost as the buildings that make up the European commission are so large they almost count as their own ecosystem. With a lot of help, I eventually navigated myself past the vast semi-circular red carpet where all the EU leaders do their arrival TV clips and found my way to the overheated side room that the British press had been allocated. Where we all waited \u2013 and waited \u2013 for people inside the room where the EU leaders were meeting to text details of what was going on to trusted media contacts. The early signs were that Theresa May\u2019s presentation had been better received than the one she had given two weeks earlier, but she had rather struggled when asked just what she hoped to achieve with a longer extension. A question you\u2019d have thought she might have seen coming and prepared a more convincing reply than, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. There again, I\u2019m no one to talk, as at one of the few work interviews I managed to get during the lost decade of my 20s, when asked why I wanted the job, I replied, \u201cI don\u2019t really\u201d. Amazingly I didn\u2019t get the job. It then turned out that Emmanuel Macron, who has one eye on the French far right parties in the forthcoming European elections, had chosen to play hardball. This was Brexit as absurdist performance art, with May asking for a 30 June deadline that she didn\u2019t want and Macron offering her a 30 June deadline that he didn\u2019t want to give as France would suffer from a no-deal scenario. Inevitably the EU 27 finally settled on a compromise of Halloween. A fitting outcome for a zombie prime minister, but one that actually suited no one. Thursday It\u2019s been reported that David Cameron has had to scale back on some of the pre-publicity for his memoirs that are scheduled for October, due to the entirely foreseeable delay to the UK leaving the EU on 29 March as had originally been planned. The official line is that he and his minders feel it would not be appropriate for him to do anything that might complicate the prime minister\u2019s job as she tries to come up with a Brexit deal that can win a majority in parliament. The cynic in me can\u2019t help feeling that, just at this moment, Dave might also not be too keen on reminding everyone that he was one of the principal architects of the shambles that has divided a nation. It\u2019s not just that the referendum was only ever a means to settle an internal squabble in the Tory party: it\u2019s also that Cameron was so negligently lazy in the way he allowed the debate to be framed. With a little more care, the biggest issues gripping the country these past three years would have been the roll-out of universal credit and HS2. I also wonder if Dave\u2019s \u201cMy Struggle\u201d autobiography will actually appear in October, as the odds are quite high on the UK seeking yet another extension on publication day. If I was Dave, I\u2019d want the dust to have settled on Brexit and for memories to have dimmed before I risked reigniting the wrath of the nation. The chapters on how loathsome and untrustworthy Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are had better be long on detail or his publishers will have trouble recouping the \u00a3800,000 advance. Friday In his 3am press conference at the end of the Brussels summit, Donald Tusk, the president of the EU council, had urged the UK not to waste the extra time it had been given.

Just as Brexit has lurched through successive phases of induction, crisis, intensification, torpor and now paroxysm that map the five act dramas of Shakespeare, so too has it produced a dramatis personae of variously wounded, self-deluded, malign or unheroic characters worthy of a Shakespearean cast: Theresa May, a Polonius who found herself unexpectedly on the throne; Jacob Rees-Mogg as a hedge-fund Bolingbroke; Michael Gove a wheedling Cassius; Dominic Grieve as the nostalgically principled John of Gaunt.</p> <p>These equivalences provide an enjoyable game, and not a new one: Shakespeare\u2019s works have always inspired contemporary parallels.

      "bodyText": "\u201cBrexit \u2013 a tragedy. Not even Shakespeare would have conceived of that ... Very depressing.\u201d When Michael Roth, Germany\u2019s Europe minister, tweeted this in November last year, he had no idea how much worse things could get \u2013 but he also may have underestimated the UK\u2019s national playwright. The combination of personal failing and collective paralysis that characterises the current political situation does in fact track the national and individual breakdown depicted in Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies. Just as Brexit has lurched through successive phases of induction, crisis, intensification, torpor and now paroxysm that map the five act dramas of Shakespeare, so too has it produced a dramatis personae of variously wounded, self-deluded, malign or unheroic characters worthy of a Shakespearean cast: Theresa May, a Polonius who found herself unexpectedly on the throne; Jacob Rees-Mogg as a hedge-fund Bolingbroke; Michael Gove a wheedling Cassius; Dominic Grieve as the nostalgically principled John of Gaunt. These equivalences provide an enjoyable game, and not a new one: Shakespeare\u2019s works have always inspired contemporary parallels. In 1593 a disturbed former soldier and fantasist maintained that he was the real Adonis to Queen Elizabeth\u2019s lusty goddess Venus, reading Shakespeare\u2019s popular erotic narrative poem as a direct political allegory. In 2017, prominent commercial sponsors withdrew from a production of Julius Caesar in New York that appeared to model the eponymous tyrant on President Trump. And where such parallels have not been easily found, the plays have been rewritten to provide them: Nahum Tate\u2019s infamous adaptation of King Lear in 1681 bins Shakespeare\u2019s bleak ending and allows a chastened but triumphant king to return to the throne, in a happy echo of the Restoration mood. Alfred Jarry reworked Macbeth in his Ubu Roi (1896) to emphasise the appetitive and infantile brutality of modernity. Deploying Shakespeare in Brexit discourse thus has a long and familiar history, and the plays have provided helpful material.

On the other hand, Chris Bryant has written that \u201cI have not a shadow of a doubt that William Shakespeare would have voted to remain,\u201d a view echoed by the academic Richard Wilson who, like Hannan, cites Cymbeline, this time in more collaborative mode: \u201cPublish this peace \u2026 Set we forward, let / A Roman and a British ensign wave / Friendly together\u201d.
