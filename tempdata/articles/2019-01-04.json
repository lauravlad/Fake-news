      "bodyText": "Fernandinho has questioned Liverpool\u2019s ability to deal with the pressure of being Premier League leaders after Manchester City\u2019s 2-1 defeat of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side. City\u2019s first win over their title rivals in five attempts reduced the gap at the top to four points with 17 matches remaining. Fernandinho, who was among City\u2019s finest performers at the Etihad Stadium on Thursday, said: \u201cFour points is going to be interesting for the rest of the season for both teams. They are still leaders and they have a lot of games to play as well. It is not easy to stay at the top because the pressure is so high. You have to win every game, so we will see what happens in the end.\u201d The midfielder pointed to the manner of the victory, in which Leroy San\u00e9 scored the winner after Roberto Firmino had cancelled out Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s opener. \u201cI am so glad because the team started so well,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the beginning of the second half we suffered a little bit and after that, even when they had the ball in possession, we defended so well, we didn\u2019t concede many chances. \u201cThis is the best way to play. Whoever wants to be champions has to be able to attack and defend. I think all the big games are like this [tense]. You cannot blink. You get punished, so you have to be careful all the time and everyone who was involved had the same feeling. We had to play our football and try to defend as well as we did, not concede goals. \u201cWe had a chance to show our quality after a couple of bad results [defeats to Leicester City and Crystal Palace].

By contrast, 27 percent mentioned immigration in December 2017. <br></p> \n  <p>Partisan divides on the best solutions remain deep. Republicans continue to be more likely to cite immigration as a top issue than Democrats, an indication of the GOP\u2019s greater intensity on the issue. But it\u2019s an increasingly important issue to members of both parties. <br></p> \n  <p>The poll found that 65 percent of Republicans say immigration is one of the top five problems facing the country, up from 42 percent in 2017. Among Democrats, 37 percent cite immigration as a top issue, compared with just 2 in 10 a year ago. <br></p> \n  <p>Roughly two-thirds of those who named immigration as a top priority express little confidence in the government to make progress this year, including a third who say they are \u201cnot at all\u201d confident. About a third say they are at least moderately confident in the government to make progress on immigration. This follows a year of intermittent deadlocked negotiations and standoffs between Trump and Democrats in Congress. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c2f77f7e4b072dc52e687c1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-04T15:44:41.642Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Rashida Tlaib stands by vow to 'impeach the motherfucker'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Newly sworn-in Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib isn\u2019t backing down from her remark Thursday that \u201cwe\u2019re going to impeach the motherfucker\u201d, speaking about Donald Trump.</p> \n  <p>In a statement Friday her office said: \u201cCongresswoman Tlaib was elected to shake up Washington, not continue the status quo.\u201d</p> \n  <p>It continued: \u201cThe Congresswoman absolutely believes he needs to be impeached and ... will not stay silent.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Tlaib added herself more succinctly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RashidaTlaib/status/1081190513691246592\">on Twitter</a>: \u201cI will always speak truth to power.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/unapologeticallyMe?src=hash\"> #unapologeticallyMe</a>\u201d</p> \n  <p>The remarks came just a few hours after Tlaib was officially sworn into office as one of the two first Muslim women to serve in Congress.

Many of the values and beliefs we hold dear at The Guardian are under threat both here in the US and around the world. Facts, science, humanity, diversity and equality are being challenged daily. As is truth. Which is why we need your help.</p> \n   <p>Powerful public figures choose lies over truths, prefer supposition over science; and select hate over humanity. The US administration is foremost among them; whether in denying climate science or hating on immigrants; giving succor to racists or targeting journalists and the media. Many of these untruths and attacks find fertile ground on social media where tech platforms seem unable to cauterise lies. As a result, fake is in danger of overriding fact.</p> \n   <p>Almost 100 years ago, in 1921, the editor of The Guardian argued that the principal role of a newspaper was accurate reporting, insisting that \u201cfacts are sacred.\u201d We still hold that to be true. The need for a robust, independent press has never been greater, but the challenge is more intense than ever as digital disruption threatens traditional media\u2019s business model. We pride ourselves on not having a paywall because we believe truth should not come at a price for anyone. Our journalism remains open and accessible to everyone and with your help we can keep it that way.</p> \n   <p>We want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported The Guardian so far. We\u2019re aiming to raise $1 million by the new year, and we hope to pass our goal by early January 2019.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s a wrap from another chaotic day in Trump\u2019s Washington. To recap: The US government remains in a partial shutdown. A meeting between Trump and congressional leaders failed to produce a breakthrough. A Democratic congresswoman is under fire for saying her party will \u201cimpeach the motherfucker\u201d in reference to Trump. In a rambling appearance outside the White House, Trump insisted Mexico is paying for the wall \u2013 while still demanding Congress pay for it; said he could declare a national emergency and build the wall himself \u2013 while still demanding Congress approve it; and claimed a president can\u2019t be impeached if he\u2019s doing \u201ca great job\u201d. Feeling a tad bit exhausted? So are we ... have a great weekend, folks, and tune in again next week! The US supreme court announced on Friday it will again wade into the controversial issue of partisan gerrymandering by taking up two cases that examine whether congressional maps were drawn in ways that violated the Constitution. America\u2019s highest court will hear the two cases in March, which concern electoral maps in North Carolina and Maryland deemed to be unconstitutional by lower courts. The case in North Carolina involved the state\u2019s entire congressional map, which was drawn up by Republicans. Although Republicans won just 53% of the statewide vote, the party was able to maintain a 10-3 majority of congressional seats in November\u2019s midterm elections. In Maryland, Republican voters alleged that a single congressional district was redrawn to favor Democrats. The supreme court ruling could carry significant consequences for the next redistricting process, which is due to occur in 2020. The federal grand jury impaneled by special counsel Robert Mueller has been extended for another six months. The grand jury was convened last year in Washington on an 18-month term, which was set to expire in the coming days. But the chief judge of the DC district court extended the grand jury\u2019s mandate for another six months, according to CNN. Remember, it\u2019s the grand jury that has considerable power to subpoena witnesses and documents. What this means: Much to Team Trump\u2019s chagrin, the Mueller investigation isn\u2019t going anywhere. Hello everyone! Sabrina Siddiqui here, taking over the blog from my trusted colleague Jamiles. I\u2019ll keep you posted on key developments over the next few hours, as we try and make sense of Trump\u2019s marathon appearance outside the White House. One quick update to kick us off: White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has called the ongoing pay freeze on federal workers an \u201cunnecessary byproduct\u201d of the government shutdown. \u201cThe Administration is aware of the issue and we\u2019re exploring options to prevent this from being implemented while some federal workers are furloughed,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cCongress can easily take care of this by funding the government and securing our borders.\u201d In other words, federal workers are not about to get paid any time soon ... even as senior Trump administration officials are poised to get raises as high as $10,000. Trump also said he would consider asking his Cabinet officials not to accept the $10,000 raise due to take effect for them tomorrow. He concludes his remarks by suggesting \u201cThe people that won\u2019t get next week\u2019s pay or the following week\u2019s pay, I think if you ever really looked at those people, I think they\u2019d say, \u2018Mr. President, keep going, this is far more important.\u2019\u201d Donald Trump seems to confirm ABC News reporting that his administration is considering building a wall without the consent or appropriation of Congress by declaring a national emergency. \u201cI can do it if I want,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.\u201d Trump is now talking about \u201cthe military version of eminent domain\u201d to build the wall, which per the fifth amendment is, bluntly, not a thing. It has the added bonus of sounding more or less like the literal definition of military conquest. Citing multiple sources, ABC News is reporting that President Donald Trump is seriously considering declaring a national emergency to help pay for parts of his desired border wall. \u201cSources tell ABC News the discussions are still on the \u2018working level\u2019 adding that there\u2019s a range of legal mechanisms that are being considered before such a decision is announced.\u201d Trump responded to Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib\u2019s high-profile call for impeachment by saying \u201cyou can\u2019t impeach somebody who\u2019s doing a great job.\u201d which is not strictly true. Is Trump still \u201cproud\u201d to shut the government down? You be the judge. Trump defended his demand for a border wall in a Rose Garden press conference this afternoon, citing traffickers who he said \u201ctake a right\u201d when they get to ports of entry, drive until the current walls end, make a left and it\u2019s \u201cWelcome to the United States\u201d. \u201cWe will have to build a steel wall...I think you are probably talking about steel,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a wall or some form of very powerful steel- now the steel is actually more expensive than the concrete but I think we\u2019re really talking about steel because I really feel the other side feels better about it.\u201d It is not clear whether Trump meant Mexico or Democrats when he referenced \u201cthe other side\u201d, nor is it clear that either party would be more amenable to a steel, as opposed to concrete barrier at the border. Updating a previous item, Trump announces that his team for ongoing negotiations over the weekend will be VP Mike Pence, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen and adviser Jared Kushner. Trump comes out sounding encouraged by today\u2019s talks, which is confusing. Because based on the line he\u2019s drawn in the sand-- the only way talks could have been productive is if Democrats put wall funding on the table. Which they did not. Is the person responsible for spell-checking White House communications on furlough thanks to the shutdown? Answer: No, probably not. The White House has been cranking out spelling and grammatical errors with regularity for nearly two years now. It\u2019s unclear who Trump\u2019s \u201ctop people\u201d are or how amenable to compromise they will be, but McConnell says Trump wants negotiations to occur over the weekend. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are addressing reporters after a meeting with president Trump over the government shutdown, and expressing little evidence of progress. Trump is expected to address the meeting in the Rose Garden shortly. Two images captured the mood in Washington this week as excited children crowded into the normally staid House of Representatives to help the re-elected speaker, Nancy Pelosi, welcome the most diverse new intake of lawmakers in US history, while Donald Trump surrounded himself with tough guys at a surprise White House press briefing, delivering another hardline push for his wall project on the US-Mexico border. Amid the ongoing government shutdown and nearly two years into the Trump presidency, US politics looked into the abyss and saw the divide in Washington \u2013 but also glimpsed the future. The most racially diverse and most female group of representatives ever elected to the House in congressional history crowded into the traditionally white and male halls of Capitol Hill for their swearing-in on Thursday afternoon. They were joined by partners, parents and children who also better reflected the country\u2019s patchwork of identities than Congress traditionally does, and signaled that a more diverse future is inevitable. In a perhaps intentional nod to forward thinking, Pelosi invited children to join her at the podium after she was handed the gavel and prepared to swear in the dozens of new members \u2013 mostly Democrats. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib initially came out defiant after describing Trump as a \u201cmotherfucker\u201d in a call for impeachment, but fled from press trying to ask her about the comments this morning, including our own Ben Jacobs. This might be why. From Politico: House Democrats are furious that an incoming freshman\u2019s expletive-riddled statement about impeaching Donald Trump has suddenly upended their carefully crafted rhetoric on their plans to take on the president. Rank-and-file Democrats, immediately fearful of the damage the comment could cause, unloaded on their new colleague Friday morning. Republicans, they argued, would hold it up as proof that Democrats are playing politics rather than pursuing genuine oversight of the president \u2014 even if the GOP never showed interest in investigating Trump scandals while it was in power. \u201cMueller hasn\u2019t even produced his report yet!\u201d said Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.), referring to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe. \u201cPeople should cool their jets a little bit, let the prosecutors do their job and finish the investigation.\u201d \u201cInappropriate,\u201d added Rep. Jim Costa (D-Calif.). \u201cAs elected officials I think we should be expected to set a high bar\u2026 It\u2019s not helpful.\u201d Longtime Republican Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas will not seek re-election in 2020, setting up an intense political scramble to replace him. Roberts has spent decades in Congress but faced pressure to step aside in part because he would have been 84 when facing voters. He also faced grueling primary and general election contests in 2014. Roberts began his Capitol Hill career as an aide in 1967. He won a U.S. House seat representing western Kansas in 1980 and was elected to the Senate in 1996. His longevity became a liability during his 2014 campaign. There are reports already that GOP leadership is hoping to tap Trump secretary of state Mike Pompeo for the seat. Freshman Congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez is still dancing after a Twitter user\u2019s attempt to shame her for a video she made in college backfired horribly. Trump has sent a letter to members of Congress from both parties repeating his call for a border wall. Democrats are unlikely to take the letter seriously as it does not even mention DACA or Dreamers, which in the past, has been the one bargaining chip Democrats felt strongly enough about to entertain a compromise on wall funding. Instead, Trump asks lawmakers to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement so families can be detained together, and alter law so that unaccompanied minors deported may be deported more quickly. Stock markets are rising on the jobs report after a rocky start to the year. Trump is close to obsessional about the markets and recently said recent wild swings were due to a \u201cglitch\u201d. But he can also thank Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell for today\u2019s rise. Powell told a conference in Atlanta that the Fed would \u201cadjust policy quickly and flexibly\u201d in the coming months if there were signs of a slowdown. Investors took that as a sign that the Fed may slow its policy of raising interest rates, something Trump has called \u201ccrazy\u201d. Trump has also threatened to fire Powell, although he may not have the legal authority. Such a move would be unprecedented and has scared investors who see an independent central bank as a pillar of the US economic system. Powell told the conference he wouldn\u2019t resign even if Trump asked him to. That news also cheered Wall Street but it means all eyes - and especially Trump\u2019s - will be on the Fed\u2019s next meeting at the end of January. While many federal workers go without pay and the government is partially shut down, hundreds of senior Trump political appointees, and Vice President Mike Pence are poised to receive annual raises of about $10,000 a year tomorrow, the Washington Post is reporting: The pay raises for cabinet secretaries, deputy secretaries, top administrators and even Vice President Pence are scheduled to go into effect beginning Jan. 5 without legislation to stop them, according to documents issued by the Office of Personnel Management and experts in federal pay. The raises appear to be an intended consequence of the shutdown: When lawmakers failed to pass bills on Dec. 21 to fund multiple federal agencies, they allowed an existing pay freeze to lapse. Congress enacted a law capping pay for top federal executives in 2013 and renewed it each year. The raises will occur because that cap will expire without legislative action by Saturday, allowing raises that have accumulated over those years but never took effect to kick in, starting with paychecks that will be issued next week. #51? Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell says he wouldn\u2019t resign if Trump asked him to. Trump has been highly critical of recent Fed interest rate hikes. According to Bloomberg News reporter Mike Dorning, Former Fed Chair Janet Yellen is warning that Trump\u2019s attacks could undermine confidence in the central bank. \u201cObviously the president has a right to comment on the Fed, but I would worry that if it continues, or intensifies, that it could undermine confidence in the Fed,\u201d she said. On their first full day in power, House Democrats voted to jump into into a court battle defending the Affordable Care Act as part of their rules package. From Politico: To ratchet up pressure on Republicans who campaigned on promises to keep the popular health care protections, they\u2019ll vote again next week on a similar stand-alone measure \u2014 authorizing the House\u2019s own general counsel to intervene alongside the Democratic states that Thursday filed an appeal of the ruling that would kill Obamacare. Said Massachusetts Representative Jim McGovern, the new chairman of the powerful Rules Committee: \u201cWe\u2019re on offense.\u201d \u201cThe American people made it very clear in the last election that health care is important, and they don\u2019t want Republicans screwing around with it. And we\u2019re going to have their backs.\u201d From the Associated Press, new poll shows Americans increasingly concerned with immigration: As much of the U.S. government remains shut down over President Donald Trump\u2019s insistence on funding for his border wall, nearly half of Americans identify immigration as a top issue for the government to work on this year. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted shortly before the shutdown began finds that both Republicans and Democrats are far more likely to include immigration in their list of top issues facing the country this year compared with a year ago. Overall, 49 percent mentioned immigration in an open-ended question as one of the top five problems they hoped the government addresses in 2019. By contrast, 27 percent mentioned immigration in December 2017. Partisan divides on the best solutions remain deep. Republicans continue to be more likely to cite immigration as a top issue than Democrats, an indication of the GOP\u2019s greater intensity on the issue. But it\u2019s an increasingly important issue to members of both parties. The poll found that 65 percent of Republicans say immigration is one of the top five problems facing the country, up from 42 percent in 2017. Among Democrats, 37 percent cite immigration as a top issue, compared with just 2 in 10 a year ago. Roughly two-thirds of those who named immigration as a top priority express little confidence in the government to make progress this year, including a third who say they are \u201cnot at all\u201d confident. About a third say they are at least moderately confident in the government to make progress on immigration. This follows a year of intermittent deadlocked negotiations and standoffs between Trump and Democrats in Congress. Newly sworn-in Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib isn\u2019t backing down from her remark Thursday that \u201cwe\u2019re going to impeach the motherfucker\u201d, speaking about Donald Trump. In a statement Friday her office said: \u201cCongresswoman Tlaib was elected to shake up Washington, not continue the status quo.\u201d It continued: \u201cThe Congresswoman absolutely believes he needs to be impeached and ... will not stay silent.\u201d Tlaib added herself more succinctly on Twitter: \u201cI will always speak truth to power. #unapologeticallyMe\u201d The remarks came just a few hours after Tlaib was officially sworn into office as one of the two first Muslim women to serve in Congress. Speaking to a crowd at a MoveOn.org event, Tlaib recalled the moment she won her election in November. \u201cAnd when your son looks at you and says, \u2018Mama look, you won. Bullies don\u2019t win,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Baby, they don\u2019t,\u2019 because we\u2019re gonna go in there and we\u2019re going to impeach the motherfucker.\u201d The comment received mixed approval on the hill. Democratic House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler told CNN early Friday morning: \u201cI don\u2019t really like that kind of language, but more to the point, I disagree with what she said. It is too early to talk about that intelligently. We have to follow the facts.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said earlier this week that her caucus would not rule out impeachment but would not rush to that possibility either, and would at least wait until special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation concludes. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn\u2019t avoid impeachment for a political reason,\u201d Pelosi said. Trump responded to the impeachment talk on Twitter Friday morning, arguing: \u201cHow do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time, done nothing wrong (no Collusion with Russia, it was the Dems that Colluded), had the most successful first two years of any president, and is the most popular Republican in party history 93%?\u201d The Trump administration has stopped cooperating with UN investigators over potential human rights violations occurring inside America, in a move that delivers a major blow to vulnerable US communities and sends a dangerous signal to authoritarian regimes around the world, our Ed Pilkington reports. Quietly and unnoticed, the state department has ceased to respond to official complaints from UN special rapporteurs, the network of independent experts who act as global watchdogs on fundamental issues such as poverty, migration, freedom of expression and justice. There has been no response to any such formal query since 7 May 2018, with at least 13 requests going unanswered. Read more: The Wall Street Journal editorial board published a column Friday calling recent comments by Donald Trump about US allies and Russian militarism a \u201cmockery\u201d, \u201cslander\u201d, \u201creprehensible\u201d, and \u201cutterly false\u201d. The comments from Trump came during a cabinet meeting Wednesday in which Trump first demeaned troop commitments from other nations in a diatribe about the US not being taken advantage of by other world governments. Trump said, \u201cThey tell me a hundred times, \u2018Oh, we sent you soldiers. We sent you soldiers\u2019... \u201cI\u2019ve heard past presidents, \u2018Well, they\u2019re involved in the Afghanistan war because they sent us 100 soldiers.\u2019 And yet, it\u2019s costing us billions and billions of dollars.\u201d The Journal called Trump\u2019s assessment \u201ca slander against every ally that has supported the U.S. effort in Afghanistan with troops who fought and often died.\u201d The editorial took even more umbrage at this historically illiterate and nonsensical statement about the late 1970s Russian incursion into Afghanistan. Here\u2019s the thing \u2014 because mentioned India: India is there. Russia is there. Russia used to be the Soviet Union. Afghanistan made it Russia, because they went bankrupt fighting in Afghanistan. Russia. So you take a look at other countries. Pakistan is there; they should be fighting. But Russia should be fighting. \u201cThe reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia. They were right to be there.\u201d \u201cRight to be there?\u201d responded the editorial. \u201cWe cannot recall a more absurd misstatement of history by an American President. The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan with three divisions in December 1979 to prop up a fellow communist government.\u201d Help us defend the truth in 2019. Make a year-end gift to the Guardian. A note from the Guardian\u2019s US editor, John Mulholland: In normal times we might not be making this appeal. But these are not normal times. Many of the values and beliefs we hold dear at The Guardian are under threat both here in the US and around the world. Facts, science, humanity, diversity and equality are being challenged daily. As is truth. Which is why we need your help. Powerful public figures choose lies over truths, prefer supposition over science; and select hate over humanity. The US administration is foremost among them; whether in denying climate science or hating on immigrants; giving succor to racists or targeting journalists and the media. Many of these untruths and attacks find fertile ground on social media where tech platforms seem unable to cauterise lies. As a result, fake is in danger of overriding fact. Almost 100 years ago, in 1921, the editor of The Guardian argued that the principal role of a newspaper was accurate reporting, insisting that \u201cfacts are sacred.\u201d We still hold that to be true. The need for a robust, independent press has never been greater, but the challenge is more intense than ever as digital disruption threatens traditional media\u2019s business model. We pride ourselves on not having a paywall because we believe truth should not come at a price for anyone. Our journalism remains open and accessible to everyone and with your help we can keep it that way. We want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported The Guardian so far. We\u2019re aiming to raise $1 million by the new year, and we hope to pass our goal by early January 2019. Every contribution, big or small, will help us reach it. Please make a year-end gift today to show your ongoing support for our independent journalism. Thank you. The US added 312,000 jobs in December, a huge rise well above forecasts, as the unemployment rate rose to 3.9% as more people entered the job market looking for work. Economists had been expecting the US to add about 180,000 new jobs in December, up from November\u2019s 155,000 jobs. The US has now added jobs for 99 consecutive months \u2013 the longest streak of job creation since records began. Numbers for November and October were also revised up by a total of 58,000. The economy added 2.64m jobs over 2018, the third-best year for job growth since the recession a decade ago. There was good news for workers on wages too. Average hourly earnings climbed by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% from November and were up 3.2% from a year earlier, their largest gain since 2008. Wages have lagged behind the recovery in the jobs market since the end of the last recession. But while the latest rise will be a boon to workers it will also stoke fears of further interest rate rises this year - a scenario that has rattled stock markets in recent months. Good morning. It\u2019s day 14 of the partial government shutdown, and there\u2019s no end in sight as Donald Trump and the newly minted Democratic House majority remain at an impasse over funding for a border wall. Trump has invited congressional leadership back to the White House on Friday to continue negotiations, but there\u2019s no reason to believe Democrats will budge in denying Trump\u2019s request for wall funding. In her first news conference since reclaiming the role of speaker of the House on Thursday, Democrat Nancy Pelosi dug in her heels over Trump\u2019s wall calling it \u201ca waste of money\u201d and \u201can immorality\u201d, according to CNN. Pelosi added: \u201cWe\u2019re not doing a wall. Does anybody have any doubt? We are not doing a wall.\u201d Asked if she would give Trump $1 for a wall to reopen the government, Pelosi said: One dollar? Yeah, one dollar. The fact is a wall is an immorality. It\u2019s not who we are as a nation.\u201d Late Thursday the newly sworn-in Democratic House majority voted to fund the government and end the shutdown, but Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has said he will not waste the Senate\u2019s time passing a bill that Trump won\u2019t sign. The White House meeting is slated for 11.30am.",

      "body": "<p><em>Spoiler alert: this article contains spoilers from series five of Luther. Do not read on if you haven\u2019t watched. </em><br><br>With any luck, we\u2019ve just watched the final ever episode of Luther. Oh sure, it\u2019s bound to come back in one form or another; the series has already managed to claw its way back from two definitive-seeming endings in 2010 and 2012, and Idris Elba seems determined to make a Luther film. But, really, there\u2019s no need. Everything about the episode we just watched dripped with finality. Anything more would be a waste.</p> <p>Alice is dead, obviously. That\u2019s the biggest clue. Because Luther the show needs Alice the character. We know this because we\u2019ve seen Aliceless episodes in the past, and they\u2019ve never been very satisfying. Luther only manages to hit its highest gear when Ruth Wilson is allowed to to run around licking her lips like Hannibal Lecter during a Vaseline shortage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94f4c0782283d8a96c2d388bda070024392d8967\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94f4c0782283d8a96c2d388bda070024392d8967/0_0_5120_3413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Wilson as Alice Morgan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luther only hits its highest gear when Ruth Wilson is running around licking her lips like Hannibal Lecter during a Vaseline shortage \u2026 Alice Morgan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Des Willie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there are other signs too. The episode ended with Luther being stripped of his coat; the show\u2019s equivalent of Superman having his cape snipped. And the final scene \u2013 Luther, surrounded by beams and pipes in the rafters of an abandoned building, watching a baddie fall to their death \u2013 was a direct echo of the very first scene of the very first episode nine years ago. Everything\u2019s come full circle.</p> <p>If this really is it for Luther, it marks the end of a fitfully brilliant and occasionally terrible series. What began a decade ago as a tense little police procedural has grown to become the closest thing the UK has to 24. It was a show about a law enforcement officer weighed down by the heavy psychic toll of his job. It had moles and jobsworth superiors and a love of offing beloved characters. It took huge, bizarre leaps of logic. It routinely sacrificed story for momentum.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/01/luther-review-the-maverick-the-minion-and-the-pincushion\">Luther review \u2013 the maverick, the minion and the pincushion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And, by god, when it was bad it absolutely sucked. The previous series, a 2015 two-parter, was seemingly scraped together out of nothing but dirt and mist. Nothing happened, and it happened slowly, and the idea to replace Alice with a woman who was identical to Alice and also apparently murdered Alice \u2013 a plot point blithely waved away this year \u2013 was one of the show\u2019s worst.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"960b47d0b9b3d17c0b969e3ab3aff18abbf4c7a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/960b47d0b9b3d17c0b969e3ab3aff18abbf4c7a6/0_145_4300_2581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"If a piece of TV makes me gasp harder than the offing of Wunmi Mosaku\u2019s character this year, my lungs might pop \u2026 DCI John Luther (Idris Elba) with DS Halliday (Wunmi Mosaku).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If a piece of TV makes me gasp harder than the offing of Wunmi Mosaku\u2019s character this year, my lungs might pop \u2026 DCI John Luther (Elba) with DS Halliday (Mosaku).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Des Willie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Luther always had a tendency to tread water at a million miles an hour, not quite able to distract you from all the flabby connective tissue it threw between jump-scares, and this was still evident for at least half of this new series. The big baddie, Enzo Cilenti\u2019s Jeremy Lake, was a collection of outfits and tics who mainly existed to fuel a million \u2018<a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2019-01-02/luther-night-bus/\">Too scared to go on the night bus</a>\u2019 memes. The George Cornelius plot \u2013 as giddily as he was played by Patrick Malahide \u2013 eventually started to feel like it was just a stepping stone to the finale.

      "bodyText": "Spoiler alert: this article contains spoilers from series five of Luther. Do not read on if you haven\u2019t watched. With any luck, we\u2019ve just watched the final ever episode of Luther. Oh sure, it\u2019s bound to come back in one form or another; the series has already managed to claw its way back from two definitive-seeming endings in 2010 and 2012, and Idris Elba seems determined to make a Luther film. But, really, there\u2019s no need. Everything about the episode we just watched dripped with finality. Anything more would be a waste. Alice is dead, obviously. That\u2019s the biggest clue. Because Luther the show needs Alice the character. We know this because we\u2019ve seen Aliceless episodes in the past, and they\u2019ve never been very satisfying. Luther only manages to hit its highest gear when Ruth Wilson is allowed to to run around licking her lips like Hannibal Lecter during a Vaseline shortage. But there are other signs too. The episode ended with Luther being stripped of his coat; the show\u2019s equivalent of Superman having his cape snipped. And the final scene \u2013 Luther, surrounded by beams and pipes in the rafters of an abandoned building, watching a baddie fall to their death \u2013 was a direct echo of the very first scene of the very first episode nine years ago. Everything\u2019s come full circle. If this really is it for Luther, it marks the end of a fitfully brilliant and occasionally terrible series. What began a decade ago as a tense little police procedural has grown to become the closest thing the UK has to 24. It was a show about a law enforcement officer weighed down by the heavy psychic toll of his job. It had moles and jobsworth superiors and a love of offing beloved characters. It took huge, bizarre leaps of logic. It routinely sacrificed story for momentum. And, by god, when it was bad it absolutely sucked. The previous series, a 2015 two-parter, was seemingly scraped together out of nothing but dirt and mist. Nothing happened, and it happened slowly, and the idea to replace Alice with a woman who was identical to Alice and also apparently murdered Alice \u2013 a plot point blithely waved away this year \u2013 was one of the show\u2019s worst. Luther always had a tendency to tread water at a million miles an hour, not quite able to distract you from all the flabby connective tissue it threw between jump-scares, and this was still evident for at least half of this new series. The big baddie, Enzo Cilenti\u2019s Jeremy Lake, was a collection of outfits and tics who mainly existed to fuel a million \u2018Too scared to go on the night bus\u2019 memes. The George Cornelius plot \u2013 as giddily as he was played by Patrick Malahide \u2013 eventually started to feel like it was just a stepping stone to the finale. The flashback, where Luther took Alice to the seaside, had sex with her once and then watched the news for a bit, was aggressively stupid. But Luther\u2019s masterstroke was always pulling everything together at the end. The climax of this series wasn\u2019t quite as audacious as the finale of the first, when Luther was framed for the murder of his own wife by his best friend, but it came pretty damn close. Framed again, shot by his serial killer love interest, with two of his friends dead \u2013 incidentally, if a piece of television makes me gasp harder than the offing of Wunmi Mosaku\u2019s character this year, my lungs might pop \u2013 Luther flailed around for the solution he always found in situations like these, only to come up short. It was just about as tense as television can get; so much so that I actively felt my body unclench halfway through the end credits. It was a wholly unhappy ending. How perfect. If Luther doesn\u2019t return, I\u2019ll miss a lot about it. I\u2019ll miss Idris Elba overusing everyone\u2019s name. I\u2019ll miss Martin Schenk floating around like a haunted painting.

If you\u2019re reading this, then you don\u2019t think the FA Cup has become a waste of time. Or your Fridays ain\u2019t what they used to be. Either way, welcome: this could prove a fun diversion from routine. </p> <p>Mauricio Pochettino is unlikely to field a full-strength team for a competition that he does not consider to be first-rate (but which he would like to win, if only to have something other than a tea cup to put in his trophy cabinet). But Tranmere plan to make life awkward for their Premier League visitors.</p> <p>Micky Mellon\u2019s side are in upbeat form, going along nicely in League Two in their first season back in the Football League following last May\u2019s thrilling promotion playoff victory at Wembley. The man who scored the winning goal against Boreham Wood that day, James Norwood, remains in scorching form, his 16 goals league goals so far this season making him the joint-highest scorer in League Two and the Prenton Park version of Harry Kane. </p> <p>Tranmere\u2019s two previous ties in this season\u2019s FA Cup \u2013 against Oxford City and Southport \u2013 went to replays. A similar outcome this time would suit them just fine. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-04T18:41:08.307Z\">at 6.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Paul Wilson\u2019s match report. A difficult interview for Tranmere manager Micky Mellon: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to say Spurs were fantastic. We\u2019re disappointed with certain moments and some of the goals. When you don\u2019t do the right things with the ball you can get punished and we were punished very heavily by a very good team. They\u2019re a fantastic team with outrageously good players. It\u2019s a tough night for the boys but it was a fantastic achievement to bring tottenham here and that\u2019s important.\u201d Pochettino\u2019s verdict: \u201cIt was a very professional performance. It was fantastic for our fans. I\u2019m very pleased.\u201d When he\u2019s told by Jake Humphreys that this is Spurs\u2019 record away win, he turns to Harry Redknapp (who\u2019s here on pundit duties) and asks: \u201cyou never did it?\u201d Redknapp proceeds to regale him with the tale of that 9-1 home win over Wigan in 2009. Asked about his team\u2019s recent away wins, Pochettino says: \u201cI am so, so pleased because the team is performing very well away from home, showing great character. Maybe it\u2019s helped by playing at Wembley because it\u2019s like playing the whole season away.\u201d He is also asked about his impression\u2019s of yesterday\u2019s Man City-Liverpool match and the title race. \u201cIt was very nice to watch but I don\u2019t care about the result. We are in a competition where there are still a lot of games to play. We have to go step by step. Of course we need to be dream and be ambitious but we also have to be realistic.\u201d Tottenham Hotspur were founded in 1882 and never have they won an official away match by a score as big as this. That\u2019s right, folks, you\u2019ve witnessed history. But no hat-trick from Serge Aurier. \u201cKudos to you and Mike Nagle for the headlines,\u201d blurts Peter Oh. \u201cThese recent scores sure do give Spurs an Aurier of invincibility.\u201d Honk! Alli: \u201cWe knew it was never going to be easy. It was all about attitude today, we had to give them a lot of respect ... then in the second half we showed our quality. It was a top performance for us but you have to give them credit for working so hard and making it difficult for us in the first half.\u201d Aurier: \u201cI\u2019m happy about my two goals and happy for the team. We\u2019re going to keep going for the next one.\u201d For almost half the game Tranmere sort of held their own ... and then they were blown away. One-nil up at half-time, Spurs were royally superior in the second period and crushed their hosts with almost relentless scoring. 90+2 min: Moura tries to get in on the act but bangs over from 20 yards. 89 min: Aurier tries again, this time from 20 yards. He smashes it with great force ... into a defenders face, potentially adding injury to insult. 87 min: Banks booked for a studs-first challenge on Skipp. He won the ball but in a naughty way. 86 min: Aurier sees the chance for a hat-trick as Kane rolls the ball into his path 20 yards from goal. He lets fly with his left foot ... and the ball sails towards the Irish Sea. 84 min: This is how the FA Cup should be. All I want from a tie is (a) a shock win for the lower league side or (b) a ruthless annihilation of the lower league side by an elite team determined to show their superiority rather than get a couple of goals in front and then knock off. Easy as you like. Alli collects the ball on the left wing, spots a run by Kane and flips the ball into his path with the outside of his foot. Kane dinks it over the advancing goalkeeper. This has been a pleasingly merciless second half by Spurs. Spurs substitution: Eyoma, another debutant, enters the fray in place of Sanchez. He\u2019ll remember this moment rest of his life. Unless Aurier completes a hat-trick, in which case everyone\u2019s minds will be blown. 77 min: A lull. We\u2019re approaching four minutes without a shot. Kane can\u2019t be happy with that. \u201cWhy are you even MBM\u2019ing this match?\u201d demands-to-know Rob Coughlin. \u201cBetter yet, why am I following your every keystroke?\u201d Because we\u2019re addicts. The first step to recovery is to admit that. Spurs substitution: Kane on - because you can never take victory for granted - and Llorente off. 74 min: Freekick to Tranmere, about 25 yards out and central. Consolation coming? Only for people consoled by the sight of Norwood smashing a shot into the wall. Spurs are scoring quicker than I can type! Llorente completes his hat-trick with an almost effortless close-range finish from a cross from the left by Moura. Skipp finds Llorente with a beautiful low pass straight through the home defence. Llorente takes it in his stride and finishes with nonchalant ease. 68 min: Tranmere haven\u2019t give up. They\u2019re still buzzing around in the hope of eking out at least one goal for their fans to cheer. \u201cI am sure you have already written your report headline: Spurs Serge to victory,\u201d blares Mike Nagle. It\u2019ll be that or Hip Hip Aurier ... Spurs substitution: Nineteen-year-old George Marsh trots on for his senior debut; Son walks off to hearty applause - he\u2019s been excellent yet again. 65 min: Norwood nicks the ball off Skipp in midfield and for a moment there seems a chance that he will run all the way through and fire off a shot. But Sanchez soon puts a stop to that far-out idea. 63 min: Jennings releases Caprice with a smart ball down the right. Caprice dashes forward and then tries a hopeful shot from 20 yards and a difficult angle. It drifts way wide. 60 min: Gazzaniga gets his hands warmed by a long-range shot. \u201cSo how\u2019s the giant-killing trope going then?\u201d asks Ed Moloney. Forget the giant-killing, from here on in it\u2019s all about finding out whether Serge Aurier is, in fact, the new Bunny Bell. Tranmere substitution: Banks on, Harris off. Oh dear. Tranmere are unravelling. Son runs from inside his own half to the edge of the area before facing any challenge, and he eludes that easily before shooting calmly past the keeper. A lovely piece of control by Son at the edge of the box as he takes down a diagonal pass and then spins and sets up Aurier, who charges in from the right to hit a powerful low shot beyond the keeper and a defender on the line. Tranmere are toast now, and Aurier\u2019s on a hat-trick! 54 min: Gazzaniga sets up an attack with a precise long kick. Moura tries to dribbe around the out-rushing keeper, but Davies gets a vital touch with his trailing leg to take it off the attacker! 52 min: A long throw-in from the right if flicked on by Monthe. Foyth jumps with Norwood and heads it further into the six-yard box. It drops to Gilmour, who Gilmour, who lashes the bouncing ball just over the bar! Aurier flicks the ball through to Son, who skips past Monthe and into the box. He looks up from the byline and pulls the ball back to Llorente, who merely has to slot it into the net from six yards. Spurs are surely on Easy Street now. 47 min: Monthe and McNulty combine to snuff out dangerous conniving between Alli and Moura on the edge of the Tranmere box. 46 min: Off we go again. \u201cIt\u2019s been the usual nerve inducing game from Spurs against lower league teams,\u201d sniffs Mike Nagle. \u201cSurely would have been a good opportunity for N\u2019Koudou who was in the last squad but not this one. Also appreciate the qualities of Dele Ali but a midfield general he is not. 1-0 at half-time but feel appearances from Kane &amp; Eriksen will be necessary.\u201d You don\u2019t think N\u2019koudou will leave the club this month? In other news, many, many people have got in touch to tell Alasdair Philips that this match can be watched in the US on a subscription channel. But why would he do that when he can follow it for free here while doing some Skeeter Bass? Serge Aurier\u2019s long-range blast is the difference between the sides, detonated at a time when Tranmere were starting to believe an upset might be on the cards. It still might, but it\u2019s going to take a mighty second-half turn-around. And you wouldn\u2019t want to miss that. Stay tuned! 44 min: Gilmour wins a corner on the left for Tranmere. Spurs deal with it sans bother. 42 min: The replay suggests that the swerve on Aurier\u2019s shot was enhanced by a slight deflection off Monthe, who tried to charge it down. Still, it was a terrific strike and a bitter reminder to Tranmere that it only takes a second for a Premier League team to transform a match in which the lower league side were starting to gain some momentum. That\u2019s a heck of a way to make Spurs comfortable! After winning possession mid-way inside the Tranmere half, the Ivorian lashed a swirling right-footed shot into the top corner! The keeper, bewildered by the swerve, barely moved! 38 min: Alli badly overhits an attempted cross towards the far post. This is turning into an uncomfortable experience for Spurs. It might have been a lot smoother if they hadn\u2019t bungled those two early chances. Now Tranmere have more belief. \u201cI\u2019m sitting in Brooklyn NY and was really looking forward to tonight\u2019s game,\u201d reveals Alasdair Philip. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m happy to follow your live updates but I would rather watch it on TV. Sadly the allure of the FA Cup is not enough to elevate it above either \u2018Facts of Fishing\u2019 episode 411 or strangely the 2nd test between South Africa and Pakistan. There\u2019s also a Skeeter Bass tournament showing, Smash Wrestling, Australian Rules Football and Kung Fu Panda 2, but no Tranmere-Spurs. If I give you my number, would you Facetime it for me?\u201d No, but if you give me your number I\u2019ll gladly publish it here and invite others to get in touch about any services they may have to offer. (I may change my stance if you offer to provide updates on that Skeeter Bass tournament, starting with what the hell is Skeeter Bass? Do you smoke it or dance to it?). 35 min: Monthe, leaning backwards, meets an outswining corner with a header from 15 yards. He directs it on target but not with enough power to trouble Gazzaniga. 32 min: Davies sends over an out-swinging corner. Llorente peels off his marker and tries to guide a sidefooted volley towards goal. But he lifts it a couple of yards over. 29 min: Lloretne knocks the ball past Monthe and tries to chase after it but runs into the defender. He turns to the referee with an exasperated look on his face as if to suggest he was barged of the ball. He gets no sympathy from the ref and even less from the crowd. 27 min: A lovely pass from midfield finds Norwood, running into the left-hand side of the box. He has Harris baying for a pass in the middle but chooses to shoot first time from a difficult angle. It flies wide several yards on the near side. Still, there\u2019s been some encouraging signs from the hosts in the last few minutes and the crowd are making noise again after being lulled into silence by Spurs\u2019 early dominance. 25 min: Gilmour\u2019s cross from the left is blocked and sent spinning into the air in the Tottenham box. Jennings keeps his eye on it and catches it sweetly on the volley when it comes down. Foyth makes a good block. 22 min: A marvellous dummy by Alli fools the Tranmere defence ... but also takes Moura by surprise. So the ball rolls through to the goalkeeper. 20 min: Tranmere are starting to put a few passes together around midfield. Nothing remotely threatening but good enough to relieve pressure temporarily. 18 min: Tranmere are in Tottenham\u2019s half! But the flag goes up for offside... 16 min: Davies comes up from his position on the left-hand side of Spurs\u2019 back three to take a freekick on the right. McNulty clears it. But its worked back to Davies, who lets fly from 25 yards. His namesake in the Tranmere goal makes a a tidy save. 14 min: That\u2019s better from Spurs! With swift passing and beguiling movement they opened up the home defence, Son slipped pass through to Moura to give Spurs another one-on-one opportunity - but Moura\u2019s finish is weak, his low shot trickling into the arms of the grateful keeper. In fairness to the Brazilian, the pitch seems a little bobbly and may have stopped him getting a cleaner connection. 12 min: Spurs continue to hog possession but Tranmere remain vigilant. McNulty has atoned for his early lapse by making a couple of fine interceptions in the box. \u201cPlease, please tell me McNulty is strong at heading corners,\u201d pleas John Boon. He\u2019s a 35-year-old centreback with the build of a butcher and part-time fire fighter: of course he\u2019s strong at heading corners. 9 min: A mistake by McNulty allows Son to race through on goal. Davies surges out to meet him ... and makes a fine save near the penalty spot! Tranmere got away with one there. 7 min: Moura becoems impatient at Spurs\u2019 slow and steady passing. He tries to dissect the home defence with a quick pass through to the overlapping Walker-Peters but it was too rushed and easily cut out. 5 min: Spurs have monopolised possession so far but Tranmere are energetic and well organised and aren\u2019t about to offer up an easy openings. 3 min: Alli, Spurs\u2019 captain for the occasion, leads a slow, probing move forward. Walker-Peters, the left wing-back, takes it up and skitters down the flank and wins a corner. Davies\u2019 delivery is cleared at the near post. 1 min: Spurs kick off. The teams are on the pitch and there\u2019s a party in the stands! The locals are determined to make the atmosphere as loud and festive as possible. It\u2019s Tottenham\u2019s job to try to shut them up. Pochettino has opted for a pretty strong lineup and has even more class on the bench, along with a couple of youngsters with who you might not be familiar: Timothy Eyoma is an 18-year-old defender who is highly enough rated to have been given a new contract in August. And George Marsh is a 19-year-old midfielder who is competitive enough to have sent Adam Lallana into a red-card rage during a reserve team match against Liverpool in February. Pochettino has warned his players not to take Tranmere lightly. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very difficult game because the FA always forces you to give your best. You cannot talk about levels in this type of competition and if you don\u2019t take it the right, the game can be problematic. We have to have the same level of motivation and energy [as Tranmere] and after that our quality should appear, but if we do not have that, it will be difficult.\u201d Micky Mellon has been talking to the TV people and his message is clear: \u201cThis is a big step forward in our recovery as a football club. I want the players and fans to be excited. We\u2019re going to have a right good go. It\u2019s a one-off shot at glory so why be afraid of that? Go for it.\u201d It\u2019s on! \u201cI\u2019ve got a good feeling about this one,\u201d announces Matt Dixon. \u201cI fancy us to come out strongly and put Tottenham under pressure early doors. McNulty will score from a corner and then we\u2019ll hang on for a famous victory.\u201d Is that all? I thought \u201cstarting strongly\u201d meant more than that at Tranmere, what with Bunny Bell &amp; Co having shown the way by scoring six goals in the first 20 minutes against Oldham back in 1935, en route to a 13-4 win. Bell, of course, scored nine that day (and missed a penalty), so the likes of Norwood and Kane have plenty more to do if they want to really impress folks in these parts. Tranmere: Davies, Ridehalgh, McNulty, McCullogh, Monthe, Caprice, Ellis, Gilmour, Harris, Jennings, Norwood Subs: Passant, Bakayogo, Buxton, Sutton, Stockton, Mullin, Banks Spurs: Gazzaniga; Foyth, Sanchez, Davies; Aurier, Skipp, Alli, Lucas, Walker-Peters; Son, Llorente. Subs: Vorm, Alderweireld, Eyoma, Marsh, Sissoko, Eriksen, Kane Hello. If you\u2019re reading this, then you don\u2019t think the FA Cup has become a waste of time. Or your Fridays ain\u2019t what they used to be. Either way, welcome: this could prove a fun diversion from routine. Mauricio Pochettino is unlikely to field a full-strength team for a competition that he does not consider to be first-rate (but which he would like to win, if only to have something other than a tea cup to put in his trophy cabinet). But Tranmere plan to make life awkward for their Premier League visitors. Micky Mellon\u2019s side are in upbeat form, going along nicely in League Two in their first season back in the Football League following last May\u2019s thrilling promotion playoff victory at Wembley. The man who scored the winning goal against Boreham Wood that day, James Norwood, remains in scorching form, his 16 goals league goals so far this season making him the joint-highest scorer in League Two and the Prenton Park version of Harry Kane. Tranmere\u2019s two previous ties in this season\u2019s FA Cup \u2013 against Oxford City and Southport \u2013 went to replays. A similar outcome this time would suit them just fine.",

      "body": "<p>Not all snowmen are made by human hands. The <em>Nieves Penitentes</em> or \u201csnow penitents\u201d are formations eerily like rows of hooded human figures, some standing more than two metres high. They have long been familiar to inhabitants of the high Andes and were described by <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Darwin_Journal_of_Researches.djvu/347\">Charles Darwin in 1839</a>. Their name comes from a resemblance to Holy Week penitents who wear tall, pointed headgear.</p> <p>These spiky figures are formed by a process called <a href=\"http://cds.cern.ch/record/449655/files/0007099.pdf\">differential ablation</a>. When the sun shines on a field of snow and the air is dry, the snow will sublimate, turning directly into water vapour rather than melting.

The Nieves Penitentes or \u201csnow penitents\u201d are formations eerily like rows of hooded human figures, some standing more than two metres high. They have long been familiar to inhabitants of the high Andes and were described by Charles Darwin in 1839. Their name comes from a resemblance to Holy Week penitents who wear tall, pointed headgear. These spiky figures are formed by a process called differential ablation. When the sun shines on a field of snow and the air is dry, the snow will sublimate, turning directly into water vapour rather than melting. This occurs unevenly, forming hollows or sun cups in the snow which catch the light and sublimate faster. The hollows grow and deepen until only rows of stalagmite-like spikes are left between them. These spikes point towards the sun, their almost vertical sides catching little of the light. The penitent remains intact once all the surrounding snow has gone.

On Friday evening, the company that built Opal Tower, Icon Constructions, announced that residents would remain in hotels for another seven days \u2013 despite promising last week that they could return by Monday. Also on Friday, the spokeswoman for the Australian Subcontractors Association, Louise Stewart, said a \u201ctoxic culture\u201d had developed where subcontractors were forced to work for unreasonable rates and asked to do extra unpaid work, which created low-quality buildings. Opal Tower, a new apartment building in Sydney\u2019s Olympic Park, developed a large crack on Christmas Eve. Further faults were later discovered and the New South Wales government has announced an emergency investigation. However, the developer and builder have said the tower is safe, structurally sound and poses no threat to safety. Stewart said the faults highlighted how subcontractors across the industry were expected to work for rates that were \u201ctoo competitive\u201d. \u201cThe subcontractors are asked to price jobs at the tender stage and even if the work is won, the prices are then shopped around and they are expected to drop their rates,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the nature of the industry, that\u2019s the way it\u2019s been working for years and it\u2019s part of the problem. \u201c[Builders] might come back and say \u2018You need to drop it by 10%\u2019. Subcontractors will price a job at fair market value and then they get completely screwed down by the builder. \u201cThe subcontractors are also asked to do extra work that is outside the scope of the price. And if you know you are not getting paid for it, you are not going to do your best work.\u201d Stewart said subcontractors made up 82% of the building industry, resulting in an increasingly competitive market. \u201cFifty years ago, builders employed large workforces and the trades were employed by the builder. Now almost none of the trades are employed by the builder. They are all subcontractors. And the subcontractors are played off against each other to get the lowest price. \u201cIt\u2019s destroying the industry,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s eroding the quality of projects.\u201d A spokeswoman for Icon rejected the claim that it used too many subcontractors. She said Icon used a \u201cvery small percentage\u201d of subcontractors, well below the industry-wide figure of 82% cited by Stewart. \u201cIcon was very happy with the contract price that was awarded, of which a very small component was for subcontractor works,\u201d she said. Icon said it did not ask subcontractors to do too much extra work \u2013 known as variations. \u201cIn terms of variations, there was no greater or less number of variations [than] on any standard build of this kind,\u201d the spokeswoman said. On Friday, the NSW planning minister, Anthony Roberts, announced the results of an \u201cinterim briefing\u201d he had received from the two professors of engineering commissioned to investigate the Opal Tower fault. \u201cWe can say from our initial assessment there is no evidence of any issues with the foundations of the building, though we believe that there are a number of design and construction issues that require further investigation,\u201d they said. The review is being led by Mark Hoffman from the University of New South Wales and John Carter from the University of Newcastle. Roberts said he did not believe any residents should be moved back into the building until an \u201cinitial report\u201d had been completed by the professors. Later on Friday, Icon announced it was taking this advice. \u201cAccordingly, Icon advises that it has secured ongoing hotel accommodation for residents until next Friday, 11 January,\u201d a statement said. \u201cWe are hopeful that the independent investigator\u2019s initial report will be made available in the course of the next week.\u201d On 27 December, Icon had told residents they could move back into their apartments within 10 days \u2013 that is, by Monday. But on 1 January, the builder announced that more cracks had been found on another level, and those affected could not move back in until those cracks were repaired. The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, told the tower\u2019s residents they should \u201cabsolutely\u201d look into legal action against the developer, Ecove, and the builder. \u201cI would if I was in their shoes,\u201d she said.",

Vicente Zambada Niebla \u2013 \u201cEl Vicentillo\u201d \u2013 is the son of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s longtime partner and co-founder of the cartel, Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada Garc\u00eda, and was once groomed to take over the business. But in court on Thursday, he testified for the prosecution. Zambada Niebla \u2013 the cartel\u2019s former operations manager, envoy to politicians and businessmen and logistics supervisor \u2013 told the court that he started accompanying his father to planning meetings as a teenager. \u201cI started realizing how everything was done,\u201d he testified, \u201cand little by little, I started getting involved in my father\u2019s business.\u201d Zambada Niebla greeted the defendant with a courteous half-smile. In contrast to the dry, often droll, testimony of previous turncoat witnesses, El Vicentillo gave meandering testimony which nonetheless gave some idea of the scope and depth of his authority: he oversaw importations of cocaine from Colombia into Mexico and onward to Los Angeles and Chicago, which he made his centre of operations. He described meeting high-level executives from Mexico\u2019s state oil company Pemex, with a view to shipping nearly 100,000kg of cocaine to the US in a tanker owned by the conglomerate, bearing its logo. Zambada Niebla also alleged that a senior military officer in the Mexican defence ministry and a member of former president Vicente Fox\u2019s security team \u2013 were accomplices of the Sinaloa cartel. Zambada Niebla is a star \u2013 potentially crucial \u2013 prosecution witness, but a controversial one. He was arrested in 2010 in Mexico City and extradited to Chicago. But he was never tried, and in April 2014 the DEA unsealed a guilty plea he had made in April 2013 in which he admitted operating a \u201cvast narcotics trafficking conspiracy\u201d. The court documents added that Zambada Niebla was now \u201ccooperating with the United States\u201d. During the first week of the Guzm\u00e1n trial, El Vicentillo entered a further guilty plea for related offences, and another agreement to cooperate \u201con any matter\u201d. He faces sentencing in March. Meanwhile, a year-long investigation by El Universal of Mexico City has traced the details of El Vicentillo\u2019s relationship with the DEA, in which he provided information in exchange for a free hand to operate. The DEA has admitted contact with El Vicentillo but denies a deal allowing him to continue trafficking. All this will make for eventful cross-examination, so far as Judge Brian Cogan will allow, as will the possibility of a variation on the narrative: it is widely believed that El Mayo and Guzm\u00e1n developed major differences, and that Zambada Garc\u00eda betrayed his former partner to Mexican authorities in order to assume sole control over the cartel. Supporters of this theory argue that Zambada Niebla\u2019s dealings with the DEA and cooperation agreements were \u2013 and still are \u2013 all part of El Mayo\u2019s plan to take Guzm\u00e1n down and secure reduced sentences for his son and brother. That would mean that El Vicentillo\u2019s testimony marks a betrayal of Guzm\u00e1n \u2013 with tacit US cooperation \u2013 but not of his father or the organisation. El Mayo\u2019s brother, Jes\u00fas Zambada Garc\u00eda, who was the cartel\u2019s accountant until his arrest in 2008, has also testified in the trial.",

Another senior official briefing the press before the trip, said that the secretary of state aimed to debunk a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d that the US was leaving the region, in the wake of Trump\u2019s order for the withdrawal of an estimated 2,000 US troops in Syria. He said there was no timeline for the withdraw and that it would be \u201cheavily coordinated\u201d with US allies in the region so as not to let up pressure on Isis, or leave a vacuum in areas of northern and southern Syria where US troops have been operating. Asked about reports of plans to raise an Arab force to take over from US troops, the official said that the US is \u201cexploring a variety of options ... but we don\u2019t have any plans right now to facilitate Arab forces going into Syria\u201d",

Theresa May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal.</p>\n    <p> As a result, the EU insists on having its own backstop - the backstop to the backstop - which would mean Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free trade deal, prompting fierce objections from Conservative hard Brexiters and the DUP, which props up her government.</p>\n    <p> That prompted May to propose a country-wide alternative in which the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the customs union after Brexit.</p>\n    <p> \u201cThe EU still requires a \u2018backstop to the backstop\u2019 \u2013 effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy. And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed,\u201d May told MPs.</p>\n    <p> Raising the stakes, the prime minister said the EU\u2019s insistence amounted to a threat to the constitution of the UK: \u201cWe have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom,\u201d she added.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Expectations are being kept deliberately low, and May is likely to begin the political year talking about the long-term future of the NHS on BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.</p> \n<p>May has recently spoken to the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. The discussions were initially confirmed by the offices of Tusk and Merkel. No 10 will not otherwise say who the prime minister has spoken to, unless the counterpart does so first.</p> \n<p>A European commission spokeswoman described the call between Juncker and May as friendly\u201d and said they \u201cagreed to stay in touch next week\u201d when Westminster returns from its Christmas break and the debate on the meaningful vote will restart.</p> \n<p>The Commons will discuss May\u2019s Brexit deal on Wednesday after prime minister\u2019s questions, continuing on Thursday and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/20/theresa-may-wishes-2018-end-remembers-2019-worse-brexit\">possibly Friday</a>.

But ministers would need to pass dozens of items of emergency legislation. Labour has said it would seek to introduce amendments that would make no deal difficult to implement.</p> \n<p>Downing Street had hoped Brexit passions would have cooled over the Christmas break as warnings mount about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/04/no-deal-brexit-would-be-catastrophic-uk-farmers-warns-nfu\">potential impact of no deal</a>, but the early signs are that rebel positions remain firm and the vote is expected to be lost.</p> \n<p>It is believed there are 30-40 Tory MPs deemed certain to vote against May\u2019s deal, including former cabinet ministers and veteran anti-EU campaigners, although that would be a significant reduction from the 100 who publicly declared their opposition in December.</p> \n<p>The DUP, whose 10 MPs help keep May in power, has been repeating its objections to the proposed Brexit arrangement over the past 24 hours, despite continuing talks with No 10 to try to resolve the impasse.</p> \n<p>Sammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, said his party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/04/dup-politician-rules-out-backing-theresa-mays-brexit-deal\">opposed the backstop</a> because if it came into force, Northern Ireland \u201cwould have to treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country\u201d and would not participate in any trade deals that the UK may enter into in the future.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/03/police-reinforcements-for-northern-ireland-in-case-of-no-deal-brexit-1000-officers-training-trouble-hard-border\">Police reinforcements for Northern Ireland in case of no-deal Brexit</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Downing Street has floated the idea of staging a second parliamentary vote almost immediately after the first in an attempt to pressure MPs to change their minds, in a crisis atmosphere of rising public concern and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/31/ftse-100-tumbles-by-125-in-2018-its-biggest-fall-in-a-decade\">jittery financial markets</a>.</p> \n<p>The argument is helped by May\u2019s position being more secure than it was in December after rebel MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/12/theresa-may-defeats-leadership-challenge-by-83-votes\">failed to unseat her</a>. Under Conservative party rules, she cannot be challenged again for nearly a year.</p> \n<p>Labour has repeatedly called for May to step aside if her deal is voted down, but she could only be forced out if she were defeated in a Commons vote of no confidence. Rebel Tories have said they would not vote with Labour in such a situation.</p> \n<p>EU sources said on Friday they did not know what May was aiming for with her round of holiday telephone diplomacy. \u201cThat is still not clear,\u201d said one diplomat, adding that the \u201csurgical removal\u201d of the backstop demanded by some Eurosceptics was \u201cnot remotely possible\u201d.</p> \n<p>A call by the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, for the EU to define the temporary nature of the backstop is not seen as realistic. \u201cDefine it how?\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a unilateral departure from the backstop and it can\u2019t be time-limited. All of this tends to run around in circles.\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, told a group of European newspapers that EU leaders could not hope to push May into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/02/corbyn-tells-may-to-strike-new-brexit-deal-labour-can-back\">organising a second referendum</a> because it would inflame political tensions.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe extent to which Britain is divided currently is small compared with the tensions a second vote would cause. It would continue to split our nation,\u201d Barclay said, in remarks first <a href=\"https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article186532540/Stephen-Barclay-Brexit-Minister-warnt-vor-Spaltung-durch-zweites-Referendum.html\">reported by Germany\u2019s Die Welt</a>.</p> \n<p>The minister said it would not be possible to hold a referendum before the EU parliamentary elections, due in May, and if Britons had to vote for MEPs again, he predicted there would be \u201chuge democratic damage, because the citizens voted to quit\u201d.</p> \n<p>Barclay even signalled that holding European elections in such a context could lead to a surge in support for Ukip or other anti-EU populists. \u201cEven our European colleagues cannot be interested in it because that would trigger a very populist reaction,\u201d Barclay said.</p> \n<p>A poll of 1,215 Conservative party members found 57% would support a no-deal Brexit if there were a three-way referendum in which May\u2019s Brexit deal and remaining in the EU were the other two options. In comparison, 25% of voters would back no deal.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May has spoken to Jean-Claude Juncker as part of her effort to obtain further written reassurances that the Irish border backstop in her Brexit deal would never come into force. The phone call between the prime minister and the European commission president on Friday was described by Brussels as \u201cfriendly\u201d but Downing Street refused to provide any further details, as May struggles to break the Brexit impasse. She is still hoping to obtain additional clarifications over the backstop before MPs vote on the deal in the week of 14 January, although it is not clear what May can get that would satisfy Tory rebels and the Democratic Unionist party. Expectations are being kept deliberately low, and May is likely to begin the political year talking about the long-term future of the NHS on BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. May has recently spoken to the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. The discussions were initially confirmed by the offices of Tusk and Merkel. No 10 will not otherwise say who the prime minister has spoken to, unless the counterpart does so first. A European commission spokeswoman described the call between Juncker and May as friendly\u201d and said they \u201cagreed to stay in touch next week\u201d when Westminster returns from its Christmas break and the debate on the meaningful vote will restart. The Commons will discuss May\u2019s Brexit deal on Wednesday after prime minister\u2019s questions, continuing on Thursday and possibly Friday. The final vote, pulled last month after the prime minister admitted she would lose by a \u201csignificant margin\u201d, is due to follow in the middle of the week following. Time is narrowing for May\u2019s deal to be approved before 29 March, because once MPs agree in principle, ratification legislation will have to be voted through by parliament, a process that normally takes months. Failure to agree would mean the UK would crash out without a deal, and it would be difficult for MPs to force the government into proposing an alternative. But ministers would need to pass dozens of items of emergency legislation. Labour has said it would seek to introduce amendments that would make no deal difficult to implement. Downing Street had hoped Brexit passions would have cooled over the Christmas break as warnings mount about the potential impact of no deal, but the early signs are that rebel positions remain firm and the vote is expected to be lost. It is believed there are 30-40 Tory MPs deemed certain to vote against May\u2019s deal, including former cabinet ministers and veteran anti-EU campaigners, although that would be a significant reduction from the 100 who publicly declared their opposition in December. The DUP, whose 10 MPs help keep May in power, has been repeating its objections to the proposed Brexit arrangement over the past 24 hours, despite continuing talks with No 10 to try to resolve the impasse. Sammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, said his party opposed the backstop because if it came into force, Northern Ireland \u201cwould have to treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country\u201d and would not participate in any trade deals that the UK may enter into in the future. Downing Street has floated the idea of staging a second parliamentary vote almost immediately after the first in an attempt to pressure MPs to change their minds, in a crisis atmosphere of rising public concern and jittery financial markets. The argument is helped by May\u2019s position being more secure than it was in December after rebel MPs failed to unseat her. Under Conservative party rules, she cannot be challenged again for nearly a year. Labour has repeatedly called for May to step aside if her deal is voted down, but she could only be forced out if she were defeated in a Commons vote of no confidence. Rebel Tories have said they would not vote with Labour in such a situation. EU sources said on Friday they did not know what May was aiming for with her round of holiday telephone diplomacy. \u201cThat is still not clear,\u201d said one diplomat, adding that the \u201csurgical removal\u201d of the backstop demanded by some Eurosceptics was \u201cnot remotely possible\u201d. A call by the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, for the EU to define the temporary nature of the backstop is not seen as realistic. \u201cDefine it how?\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a unilateral departure from the backstop and it can\u2019t be time-limited. All of this tends to run around in circles.\u201d Meanwhile, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, told a group of European newspapers that EU leaders could not hope to push May into organising a second referendum because it would inflame political tensions. \u201cThe extent to which Britain is divided currently is small compared with the tensions a second vote would cause. It would continue to split our nation,\u201d Barclay said, in remarks first reported by Germany\u2019s Die Welt. The minister said it would not be possible to hold a referendum before the EU parliamentary elections, due in May, and if Britons had to vote for MEPs again, he predicted there would be \u201chuge democratic damage, because the citizens voted to quit\u201d. Barclay even signalled that holding European elections in such a context could lead to a surge in support for Ukip or other anti-EU populists. \u201cEven our European colleagues cannot be interested in it because that would trigger a very populist reaction,\u201d Barclay said. A poll of 1,215 Conservative party members found 57% would support a no-deal Brexit if there were a three-way referendum in which May\u2019s Brexit deal and remaining in the EU were the other two options. In comparison, 25% of voters would back no deal.",

      "bodyText": "An attempt to humiliate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as she was sworn in as the youngest ever US congresswoman has backfired impressively, prompting a huge outpouring of support for her. A 30-second video was posted by a Twitter user called AnonymousQ, showing Ocasio-Cortez dancing on the roof of a building while in college. \u201cHere is America\u2019s favorite commie know-it-all acting like the clueless nitwit she is,\u201d read the post, with the user, who has since deleted their account, claiming it was a \u201chigh school video of \u2018Sandy\u2019 Ocasio-Cortez\u201d. But instead of embarrassing Ocasio-Cortez, who was elected to represent New York\u2019s 14th congressional district in November, the video has bolstered her popularity, with many people on social media praising her for being joyful and having fun. Having already tweeted the riposte \u201cYou hate me coz you ain\u2019t me, fellas,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez on Friday afternoon posted a brand new short video of herself dancing outside her new congressional office. In the lighthearted, 11-second clip, she dances and sings (or lip-syncs) along to a line from Edwin Starr\u2019s classic Motown hit War: \u201cWhat is it good for? Absolutely nothing,\u201d pointing half playfully, half defiantly at the camera before bursting into laughter and flinging herself through the door of her office as if she had occupied her seat on Capitol Hill for years, not 24 hours. With the clip, she wrote: \u201cI hear the GOP [Republican party] thinks women dancing are scandalous. Wait till they find out Congresswomen dance too! Have a great weekend everyone :)\u201d The original short clip from her student days was part of a longer video, made while she was an undergraduate at Boston University. In it, she and several other students dance on the rooftop of a university building to the song Lisztomania by Phoenix, in a mash-up of a dance from the Breakfast Club. Comedian Patton Oswalt joked: \u201cShe\u2019ll never recover from the world seeing her \u2026 (watches video) \u2026 dancing adorably and having fun with her friends in high school?\u201d Reacting late on Thursday and early Friday to the first video, before Ocasio-Cortez posted her ripostes, the actor Russell Crowe said the dance was \u201cfantastic\u201d. He added: \u201cThe more politicians we have like AOC the sooner we\u2019ll all be dancing.\u201d Ally Sheedy, who played Allison Reynolds in The Breakfast Club, and whose dance moves Ocasio-Cortez was imitating, said she was \u201cpretty happy \u2019bout it\u201d, later writing: \u201cI love this #teamAOC.\u201d A Twitter account was soon created called \u201cAOC Dances To Every Song\u201d, setting her dance moves to hits such as Kids in America by Kim Wilde and Rebel Rebel by David Bowie. The clips of the young congresswoman getting her groove on have been shared hundreds of thousands of times \u2013 emphasizing how bad politicians normally are at dancing, as highlighted by the British prime minister, Theresa May, and her departed foreign secretary and Brexit nemesis, Boris Johnson. Since her election, Ocasio-Cortez has repeatedly been the target of criticism from the right, including for her clothing choices. Fox News also attacked her for claiming she wouldn\u2019t be able to afford an apartment in Washington DC until her congressional salary started, saying Ocasio-Cortez was stretching the truth about how poor she was when she had $15,000 (\u00a312,000) in savings. Her communications director later confirmed that Ocasio-Cortez, a former Bernie Sanders staffer who earned about $27,000 in 2017, had less than $7,000 in savings. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory in the Democratic primary against incumbent Joe Crowley was one of the biggest upsets of the primary season. Ocasio-Cortez ran on a platform of Medicare for All and abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) department. She has already begun a campaign to make climate change a defining issue for Congress. She is also an adept social media user and has 1.74 million followers on Twitter and 1.2 million on Instagram, and regularly engages with them. She posted a video diary on Instagram documenting her first week in Washington. Meanwhile, Donald Trump\u2019s team demonstrated a slightly less deft touch with social media on Thursday, posting a picture on Instagram of his face looming over the phrase \u201cThe wall is coming\u201d, written in the Game of Thrones font. This is the second time this week the president has misappropriated the tagline from the hit television show to refer to his policies. On Wednesday, Trump posted a photograph of himself in a cabinet meeting with a poster on the table reading: \u201cSanctions are coming \u2026 November 5.\u201d While it is clear that someone on Trump\u2019s team knows enough about Game of Thrones to know that there is, indeed, a wall in it, perhaps his team should watch a little more of the series before drawing any further parallels between Trump\u2019s desired border wall and the ice wall in the HBO series.",

      "body": "<p>Children\u2019s use of social media and the internet is a problem. That doesn\u2019t mean it should be stopped. The internet is at least as interesting and fun for children as it is for adults, and social media is a fact of life. While younger children should not be on platforms where 13 is the minimum age, it is neither practical nor desirable to imagine a world in which teenagers are prevented from accessing the platforms and messaging systems that the adults around them use to organise their lives.</p> <p>But the pleasure and stimulation that people of all ages find on their screens and smartphones must not blind us to the harm that spending time in this way can cause. The finding that the alarmingly high rate of depression in British teenage girls is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/04/depression-in-girls-linked-to-higher-use-of-social-media\" title=\"\">closely correlated to time spent on social media</a> is extremely concerning. Research drawn from interviews with almost 11,000 14-year-olds found that two in five girls are on social media for at least three hours a day \u2013 with half as many boys engaged to the same extent. More than a third of depressed girls have experienced online harassment. About half of affected girls suffered disrupted sleep, compared with 20% of depressed boys.</p> <p>Children\u2019s charities and clinicians have long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/26/social-media-firms-failing-to-protect-young-people-survey-finds\" title=\"\">highlighted cyberbullying</a> and issues around self-esteem, often linked to anxieties around attractiveness and sexuality, particularly among girls. While there is nothing new about teenagers being unkind to each other, there is a world of difference between whispered rumours and Photoshopped images. Feeling excluded or unpopular has always been painful, but it didn\u2019t use to be possible for children to torment themselves \u2013 or others \u2013 with feeds featuring pictures of their peers having a wonderful time.</p> <p>Although the research does not prove that social media causes depression, the importance of the finding that there is a connection should not be underestimated. This is an area in which, despite a great deal of worrying, evidence remains limited. Schools have done important work in communicating key messages about the risks of online abuse and grooming. But when it comes to broader questions about \u201cscreen time\u201d \u2013 an unhelpfully broad category conflating television, ebooks, gaming and social media \u2013 many professionals as well as parents are confused and uncertain.</p> <p>The health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/29/health-chief-set-social-media-time-limits-young-people\" title=\"\">Matt Hancock, wants official guidelines on time and age limits</a>, and has asked chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies to provide them. This idea has the virtue of simplicity, though some experts question its effects and call for a greater degree of differentiation, arguing that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/04/screen-time-not-intrinsically-bad-for-children-say-doctors\" title=\"\">time online per se is not a bad thing</a> and it all depends what you are doing. Also due this year is information commissioner Elizabeth Denham\u2019s <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/ico-and-stakeholder-consultations/call-for-views-age-appropriate-design-code/\" title=\"\">Age Appropriate Design Code</a>, covering the use of children\u2019s personal data. Both initiatives are welcome. But the government is playing catch-up. Statutory regulation of the digital media giants is long overdue. The failure to protect children from data harvesting and targeted advertising thus far is as shocking as the lack of concern shown by the companies themselves with regard to children\u2019s psychological health.</p> <p>Of course, social media companies are not the source of all our ills, and can offer a too-easy target for politicians keen to deflect attention from inadequately resourced schools and health services. There are other reasons for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/22/mental-health-disorders-on-rise-among-children-nhs-figures\" title=\"\">rising incidence of depression in young people</a>, with increasing pressure to succeed in education and in life more broadly \u2013 to be famous, beautiful, rich \u2013 often cited as a source of unhappiness or anxiety which can, if aggravated by other factors, and not managed, tip into ill health. But it is shaming that so many inroads into young people\u2019s lives and minds have been made by a handful of Silicon Valley companies whose priority is profit. Safeguarding means more than the avoidance of physical threat.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Children\u2019s use of social media and the internet is a problem. That doesn\u2019t mean it should be stopped. The internet is at least as interesting and fun for children as it is for adults, and social media is a fact of life. While younger children should not be on platforms where 13 is the minimum age, it is neither practical nor desirable to imagine a world in which teenagers are prevented from accessing the platforms and messaging systems that the adults around them use to organise their lives. But the pleasure and stimulation that people of all ages find on their screens and smartphones must not blind us to the harm that spending time in this way can cause. The finding that the alarmingly high rate of depression in British teenage girls is closely correlated to time spent on social media is extremely concerning. Research drawn from interviews with almost 11,000 14-year-olds found that two in five girls are on social media for at least three hours a day \u2013 with half as many boys engaged to the same extent. More than a third of depressed girls have experienced online harassment. About half of affected girls suffered disrupted sleep, compared with 20% of depressed boys. Children\u2019s charities and clinicians have long highlighted cyberbullying and issues around self-esteem, often linked to anxieties around attractiveness and sexuality, particularly among girls. While there is nothing new about teenagers being unkind to each other, there is a world of difference between whispered rumours and Photoshopped images. Feeling excluded or unpopular has always been painful, but it didn\u2019t use to be possible for children to torment themselves \u2013 or others \u2013 with feeds featuring pictures of their peers having a wonderful time. Although the research does not prove that social media causes depression, the importance of the finding that there is a connection should not be underestimated. This is an area in which, despite a great deal of worrying, evidence remains limited. Schools have done important work in communicating key messages about the risks of online abuse and grooming. But when it comes to broader questions about \u201cscreen time\u201d \u2013 an unhelpfully broad category conflating television, ebooks, gaming and social media \u2013 many professionals as well as parents are confused and uncertain. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, wants official guidelines on time and age limits, and has asked chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies to provide them. This idea has the virtue of simplicity, though some experts question its effects and call for a greater degree of differentiation, arguing that time online per se is not a bad thing and it all depends what you are doing. Also due this year is information commissioner Elizabeth Denham\u2019s Age Appropriate Design Code, covering the use of children\u2019s personal data. Both initiatives are welcome. But the government is playing catch-up. Statutory regulation of the digital media giants is long overdue. The failure to protect children from data harvesting and targeted advertising thus far is as shocking as the lack of concern shown by the companies themselves with regard to children\u2019s psychological health. Of course, social media companies are not the source of all our ills, and can offer a too-easy target for politicians keen to deflect attention from inadequately resourced schools and health services. There are other reasons for the rising incidence of depression in young people, with increasing pressure to succeed in education and in life more broadly \u2013 to be famous, beautiful, rich \u2013 often cited as a source of unhappiness or anxiety which can, if aggravated by other factors, and not managed, tip into ill health. But it is shaming that so many inroads into young people\u2019s lives and minds have been made by a handful of Silicon Valley companies whose priority is profit. Safeguarding means more than the avoidance of physical threat.",

      "bodyText": "Anti-abortion activists have struck back against Ireland\u2019s introduction of abortion services by picketing a clinic and by launching potentially misleading websites that mimic the state\u2019s support service for unplanned pregnancies. A group holding placards protested outside a doctor\u2019s office in Galway on Thursday in an effort to deter women from seeking abortion pills just three days after abortion services became legal. About half a dozen people stood outside the Galvia West medical centre in Galway city with signs bearing slogans including \u201cSay no to abortion in Galway\u201d and \u201cReal doctors don\u2019t terminate their patients.\u201d Organisers said it was a peaceful demonstration that received positive feedback from the public. However, pro-choice groups condemned the picket as intimidation and urged the government to establish exclusion zones to prevent protests outside abortion service providers. \u201cI do find that this is public harassment, effectively, of people who are trying to access abortion services here,\u201d Ailbhe Smyth from the Together for Yes campaign told Newstalk radio station on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s despicable behaviour because they are deliberately seeking to deter women from accessing an entirely lawful health service in this country.\u201d She called on the health minister, Simon Harris, to deliver on a promise to introduce legislation for exclusion zones around medical practices offering abortion services, a call backed by Colm O\u2019Gorman, the head of Amnesty Ireland. \u201cExclusion zones don\u2019t mean people cannot protest,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cBut they must do so in a way that doesn\u2019t interfere with another person\u2019s right to access a lawful health service.\u201d Meanwhile, other anti-abortion activists are believed to be behind several websites that mimic myoptions.ie, a support site for women affected by unplanned pregnancies run by the Health Service Executive (HSE), a state agency. The site, which launched on Tuesday, directs women who seek abortions to advice and information about how to access the service, which is set to roll out across Ireland in the coming weeks and months. The HSE warned this week of websites with possible hidden agendas using similar names to its helpline. The mimic sites try to steer women away from abortions by warning of health dangers and offering ultrasounds to show an image of the foetus. \u201cCall us now and book a free ultrasound if you are thinking about termination and need to know how far pregnant you are and all you need to know to be fully informed,\u201d says one such site, myoptions.website. It links to research which claims to link abortions to breast cancer, an association which has been widely discredited by physicians and scientists. When the Guardian called its helpline, it was answered by Eamon Murphy, a veteran anti-abortion activist based in Dublin. \u201cWe\u2019re flooded with phone calls and demands,\u201d he said. He cited research purportedly connecting abortions to cancer. \u201cWe\u2019re probably the only people telling women of the link.\u201d Asked about misleading callers by mimicking the state\u2019s helpline, Murphy said his site was set up last year, predating the official site. Asked for more details, he ended the call. Ireland started rolling out abortion services on 1 January in the wake of the referendum vote last year to lift a near-total ban on abortion, a landmark in the country\u2019s social liberalisation. A total of 66.4% of voters delivered a stinging rebuke to the Roman Catholic church by voting to repeal the eighth amendment to the constitution, which gave \u201cthe unborn\u201d equal rights to pregnant women and made abortion illegal even in cases of rape, incest or severe danger to the mother. Fast-track legislation led to the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act being signed into law on 20 December 2018, paving the way for service rollout this month. Most of the state\u2019s 19 maternity units, plus clinics run by other organisations, are expected to start offering abortion services within weeks. About 20 women reportedly sought terminations on the first working day of the service on Wednesday. Under the new system, GPs will provide abortions to women up to nine weeks pregnant and hospitals will perform terminations at between nine and 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, abortions will be allowed only in exceptional circumstances. The service will be largely free, with the state paying GPs approximately \u20ac400 (\u00a3358) per patient.",

      "bodyText": "Brexit anxiety dragged the UK economy almost to a standstill at the end of 2018, as a key gauge for the largest sector of the economy showed optimism among firms fell to the lowest levels since the financial crisis. According to the latest snapshot for the services sector compiled by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply \u2013 which covers banks, restaurants and hotels \u2013 subdued growth conditions persisted in December, with concerns over the UK\u2019s departure from the EU resulting in companies putting spending decisions on hold. In an early warning sign that GDP growth almost certainly stalled in the final three months of 2018, the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) showed lower demand from cash-strapped consumers also acted as a brake on sales. While the Markit/Cips services sector PMI rose slightly to 51.2 last month from 50.4 in November, the rate of increase in business activity was one of the slowest since the Brexit vote in 2016. Economists said that GDP growth in the final quarter would plunge to 0.1% from a rate of 0.6% in the third quarter, ending the stronger period of growth over the summer and falling well short of the 0.3% expected by the Bank of England and the Treasury. The warning came as it emerged UK house prices grew at the slowest rate in almost six years. According to the Nationwide house price index, annual values grew on average by 0.5%, the slowest since February 2013. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said the slowdown was prompted by the \u201cimpact of the uncertain economic outlook on buyer sentiment\u201d. Borrowing figures published by the Bank of England on Friday also revealed faltering demand for consumer credit and mortgages in November, in a further sign of the drop in retail spending and home purchases. Threadneedle Street\u2019s statisticians noted: \u201cThe extra amount consumers have borrowed each month to buy goods and services has slowed in the second half of 2018.\u201d The latest IHS Markit/Cips report on the services sector, which covers about 80% of the UK economy, showed November and December marked the weakest two months for morale among businesses since March 2009 \u2013 the low point of the recession that followed the financial crisis. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: \u201cThe service sector typically plays a major role in driving economic growth, but is now showing worrying signs of having lost steam amid intensifying Brexit anxiety.\u201d It comes after the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 10% of the economy, recorded stronger growth last month as companies ramped up their stockpiling to protect against the risk of a no-deal Brexit in less than 90 days\u2019 time. While the services PMI provides an early warning indicator, and is watched closely by the Bank and the Treasury, it reflects businesses reporting worse conditions rather than any exact details of slowing growth. Official growth figures for the fourth quarter of 2018 will not come until early February. Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, cautioned the PMI was \u201coverstating the extent of the easing\u201d in the economy towards the end of last year. \u201cWe think that 0.3% quarter-on-quarter [GDP growth] is more likely. If a Brexit deal is agreed soon, growth will surely rise this year,\u201d he said. MPs failing to reach a deal to support Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan or to come to a form of compromise agreement ahead of the 29 March deadline will likely act as a drag on business activity and discourage consumers from spending.

This led Nasa to call her \u201cmother of Hubble\u201d.</p> <p>Joining <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/nasa\" title=\"\">Nasa</a> in 1959, just six months after the agency opened, Roman was in charge of developing a programme of astronomy from space. She travelled the US talking to astronomers in their various universities and listening to their ambitions. She also discussed with them the advantages of observing from space, where there was no atmosphere to blur the view and no daytime to halt the observatory\u2019s work for half the day.</p> <p>In 1960, she brought together around 30 astronomers and Nasa engineers to discuss the idea of a large, general-purpose space telescope. It would cost 20 times the price of the largest ground-based telescope, so Roman wanted them to come up with something that made sense to everyone. The astronomers could say what they wanted to use it for, and the engineers could talk about how to build such an instrument. Because the two groups did not speak the same technical language, Roman acted as interpreter between them.</p> <p>This laid the foundation, but it took until the 1970s for certain key technologies to be developed. These included the CCD chips that made the first digital cameras possible. Once these were available, Roman set up the programme that built the Hubble space telescope. It was painstaking work, and by the time the telescope was launched in 1990, Roman had been retired from Nasa for 11 years, becoming a consultant and an advocate for women in science.</p> <p>She was born in Nashville, Tennessee, the only child of Georgia (nee Smith), a former music teacher, and Irwin Roman, a geophysicist. Because of her father\u2019s job, the family lived a peripatetic life, moving to Oklahoma, Texas, New Jersey, Michigan and Nevada. Roman remembered her mother taking her outside as a child in Michigan to look at the natural world.

They settled on the edge of Reno, well away from the city lights, and Nancy found the stars captivating. At the age of 11, she organised her friends into an astronomy club. They would read together about the constellations, learning about the exotic celestial objects to be found within them. Nancy\u2019s interest took her to the public library where she devoured any book she could find about space, and she determined to become an astronomer. But navigating towards that goal proved unexpectedly difficult. In high school, she asked to take a second year of algebra instead of a fifth year of Latin. Her guidance counsellor retorted: \u201cWhat lady would take mathematics instead of Latin?\u201d</p> <p>She continued to encounter the belief that women did not become scientists throughout her schooling. Only in her first year at Swarthmore College, Pennsylvania, did she receive her first begrudging encouragement. While she was working in the lab one day, the head of physics confessed to her that he usually tried to talk women out of going into physics but in Roman\u2019s case he conceded that she \u201cmight make it\u201d. She graduated with a degree in astronomy in 1946. Moving to the University of Chicago, she earned a PhD in astronomy three years later and started working at the university\u2019s Yerkes Observatory. Yet, after six years of professional success at Yerkes, her future was not secure.</p> <p>She was not a permanent staff member and she could see that those positions were overwhelmingly going to men. Her chance came in 1955 when she saw an astronomer was needed for the US government\u2019s Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC. She applied for and got the job. Four years later, she was tipped off that the recently formed Nasa was looking for someone to set up its space astronomy programme. She won that position, too, and it was at Nasa that she finally felt men treated her as an equal.</p> <p>As part of her work that would culminate in the Hubble space telescope, she developed and budgeted numerous smaller space observatories. In particular, the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory programme was a series of four space observatories launched between 1966 and 1972.

Health service managers said they hoped the move would end the persistent criticism that only a minority of young people receive help for debilitating conditions such as depression, eating disorders and psychosis. The pledge will be included in the NHS long-term plan to be launched by the prime minister and the chief executive of NHS England, Simon Stevens, at a hospital on Monday. For years MPs, psychiatrists, mental health charities and families have accused the NHS of letting down troubled teenagers by not ensuring that more of them received treatment. The NHS responded by agreeing to increase the proportion of those with a diagnosable mental health condition who get treated from 25% to 35% by 2020-21. However, key people, such as the children\u2019s commissioner, Anne Longfield, said that even the revised ambition was inadequate and cast doubt on the NHS\u2019s commitment to ensuring \u201cparity of esteem\u201d between mental and physical health. The long-term plan \u2013 which will set out how the NHS plans to spend the extra \u00a320.5bn a year it will receive by 2023-24 \u2013 will make clear that many more under-18s will receive care over the next few years. Stevens has been considering pleas from Claire Murdoch, NHS England\u2019s national mental health director, and Paul Farmer, the chief executive of the mental health charity Mind, to increase the treatment target from 35% to 50%. When questioned by MPs in October about the 35% figure, Stevens assured them the target would rise as part of the plan to deliver \u201ca more ambitious set of service expansions and reforms in mental health, as well as in other areas\u201d. He said improvements in access to treatment meant 30.5% of under-18s were already being helped by specialist NHS child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs), and the NHS was \u201con track\u201d to meet the 35% target by 2020-21. May has pledged to dramatically improve NHS mental healthcare for people of all ages as part of her personal agenda to address the \u201cburning injustices\u201d in British society she identified when she took office in July 2016. The prime minister has made better help for under-18s a key priority, and unveiled plans to give schools a key role and introduce a maximum four-week waiting time for young people to start receiving help, although initially only in some parts of England. Stevens has cautioned that serious staffing problems across mental health services limit the NHS\u2019s ability to expand Camhs care to deal with the growing number of under-18s affected by mental ill-health. He told the public accounts committee of MPs: \u201cWe want to get to a position where ultimately every child who needs a specialist NHS mental health service is able to get it, but that might not be the same as every child with a diagnosable mental health condition, which at the moment is what the 30% or 35% is tracking.\u201d May will reveal key elements of the plan on The Andrew Marr Show on BBC One on Sunday morning, with the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, giving further details on Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News. Mental health campaigners made clear the plan must significantly increase the number of children and young people who receive help. They said that, just as NHS bosses would not allow under-18s with a serious physical condition, such as cancer, to go untreated, the same should apply to those with psychological or psychiatric conditions, some of which can lead to self-harm and suicide. \u201cThe previous target of treating just a third of under-18s with a diagnosable mental health condition simply isn\u2019t good enough, particularly given that the most recent statistics on the number of young people experiencing mental ill health showed there has been a significant increase in the last decade,\u201d said Dr Bernadka Dubicka, the chair of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists. \u201cIf they were waiting months or even years for cancer treatment there would be an outcry, which is why we\u2019ve repeatedly asked the government to address this issue.\u201d The college has lobbied Stevens to commit in the plan to treating at least 45% of children in need by 2023-24, and wants to see that increased again to 70% by 2028-29. Anne Longfield, a vocal critic of the delays and rationing of care families face when seeking help for their child from Camhs, said all young people with mental health problems should get help. \u201cI\u2019ll welcome any progress being made to improve services, but any system that does not provide Camhs support to every child who needs it will still be failing thousands of children.

      "body": "<p>Ministers are facing a fresh confrontation with local councils over their controversial plans to expand fracking, after one of the biggest combined authorities in the country set out plans to ban the practice.</p> \n<p>Greater Manchester\u2019s decision to effectively stop companies from extracting underground shale gas in the region was greeted as a critical moment in the fight against fracking, which critics say is dangerous and unproven.</p> \n<p>The 10 local authorities that make up Greater Manchester will put planning measures in place to create a \u201cpresumption\u201d against fracking for shale gas, said the area\u2019s mayor, Andy Burnham, as part of its effort to become carbon neutral by 2038.</p> \n<p>The announcement, which comes as London finalises a similar scheme, will amplify discontent among local councils \u2013 including Tory-controlled authorities \u2013 that experts said could lead to a showdown with central government, and potentially kill off ministers\u2019 plans.</p> \n<p>Concerns about the drilling technique were again raised in the run-up to Christmas when the energy company Cuadrilla was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/26/cuadrilla-forced-to-stop-fracking-as-quake-breaches-threshold\">forced to pause operations</a> near Blackpool three times after drilling caused small earthquakes that breached legal limits.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5cf8a4d1-3f7f-420b-9d0f-551632c48434\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a way of extracting natural gas from shale rock formations that are often deep underground. It involves pumping water, chemicals and usually sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale \u2013 hence the name \u2013 and release the gas trapped within to be collected back at the surface.</p>\n    <p>The technology has transformed the US energy landscape in the last decade, owing to the combination of high-volume fracking \u2013 1.5m gallons of water per well, on average \u2013 and the relatively modern ability to drill horizontally into shale after a vertical well has been drilled.</p>\n    <p>In England, the government placed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/02/fracking-banned-in-uk-as-government-makes-major-u-turn\">a moratorium</a> on fracking in November 2019 after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/26/anti-fracking-activists-jailed-for-blackpool-cuadrilla-protest\">protests</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/12/anti-fracking-campaigner-loses-legal-bid-to-block-cuadrilla\">legal challenges</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/29/fracking-application-cuadrilla-rejected-lancashire-county-council\">planning rejections</a>. A year earlier, the energy company Cuadrilla was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/29/strongest-tremor-yet-halts-fracking-at-cuadrilla-site-near-blackpool\">forced to stop work&nbsp;</a>at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire twice in four days due to minor earthquakes occurring while it was fracking. The tremors breached a seismic threshold imposed after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/02/fracking-cause-lancashire-quakes\">fracking caused minor earthquakes at a nearby Cuadrilla site in 2011</a>. In March 2019 the high court ruled that the government's fracking guidelines were unlawful because they had failed to sufficiently consider scientific evidence against fracking.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Several other authorities \u2013 including Leeds, Wakefield, Hull and York \u2013 have expressed opposition to fracking, and experts believe the stance taken by Manchester and London will embolden others.</p> \n<p>Many Conservatives are also opposed. In Westminster, almost two dozen Tory MPs are reported to be against fracking and willing to \u201cdestroy the government\u2019s majority\u201d if it tries to weaken planning laws.</p> \n<p>Several Tory-run local authorities \u2013 including Derby, Dorset and Nottinghamshire \u2013 are fiercely opposed to the change in planning proposals, which would mean companies could drill test sites without applying for planning permission.</p> \n<p>Manchester\u2019s decision echoes similar policies already pursued by the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales. Scottish government has a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/03/scottish-government-bans-fracking-scotland-paul-wheelhouse\" title=\"\">shale gas moratorium</a> and the Welsh government has promised to <a href=\"https://gov.wales/newsroom/environmentandcountryside/2018/180703-welsh-government-consults-on-new-powers-for-petroleum-extraction/?lang=en\" title=\"\">block any applications</a>.</p> \n<p>Tom Fyans from the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), said Greater Manchester\u2019s policy was a significant moment. \u201cThe decision is symbolic of the growing opposition to the government\u2019s plans to fast-track fracking, which look to override local democracy by disregarding the wishes of local communities and deny those very people the opportunity to have their say on decisions that will ultimately affect them and the health of their countryside,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Burnham said: \u201cIt\u2019s about embracing the future, not the past. Cities like Greater Manchester need to join the group of leading cities on the world stage that are driving fast towards carbon neutrality.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat is a big challenge and it must be embraced wholeheartedly, and it means a full commitment to renewable energy and not half measures, and not clinging on to processes that hark back to a past.\u201d</p> \n<p>In London, the city\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, who last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/11/london-mayor-sadiq-khan-city-climate-emergency\">declared a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d</a>, has said he will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/26/fracking-london-sadiq-khan-mayor\">throw out all fracking proposals</a>. His draft London plan, which will be ratified later this year, introduces an effective ban on fracking across the capital.</p> \n<p>Tony Bosworth of Friends of the Earth said: \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that they are opposed by local councils around the country, including many controlled by the Conservatives. In order to deal with the climate crisis, we need to be moving away from fossil fuels, not making it easier for companies to dig up more.\u201d</p> \n<p>The scale of opposition within the Conservative party was underlined last year when a survey commissioned by CPRE and Friends of the Earth found <a href=\"https://www.cpre.org.uk/media-centre/latest-news-releases/item/4927-polling-shows-conservative-councillors-at-odds-with-government-on-plans-to-fast-track-fracking\">80% of Conservative councillors</a> in areas where fracking companies have a licence believe planning applications should be required before drilling.</p> \n<p>About 2.6 million people live in Greater Manchester, large parts of which are within \u201cshale-prospective areas\u201d identified by the British Geological Survey and the Oil and Gas Authority. Energy companies have been granted licences to pursue oil and gas exploration in the west and north of the region, with iGas the first to drill a combined coalbed methane and shale gas exploration well in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/11/anti-fracking-campaigners-salford-court-barton-moss\">Barton Moss in Salford</a> in 2013-14.</p> \n<p>The combined authority\u2019s proposals on fracking are part of a wider, more ambitious environmental plan. Manchester city council, one of its10 local authorities, has already <a href=\"https://secure.manchester.gov.uk/news/article/8076/ambitious_climate_change_target_proposed_for_manchester\">agreed to the goal</a> after accepting advice from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. The wider region is expected to follow suit soon.</p> \n<p>Cities such as Berlin, Boston, Copenhagen, London and New York have joined the the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance, pledging to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80%-100% by 2050 or sooner.</p> \n<p>Burnham said the decision to move against fracking came about after council leaders looked at what happened in Lancashire, where fracking started in October at Preston New Road near Blackpool <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/uk-fracking-given-go-ahead-as-lancashire-council-rejection-is-overturned\">against the will</a> of the local authority after a government intervention. The earthquakes caused by the Cuadrilla activity were a serious concern, Burnham said.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor the legal limits to be breached so regularly is a worry, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s hard to know what damage is being done and the effect that is having on groundwater and all of those other issues that emerge,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s even more worrying in Greater Manchester, which is a much more urban place, where there is more contaminated land, more mine shafts. This is an industry which hasn\u2019t proven its case. In fact, the opposite.\u201d</p> \n<p>Burnham accepted that Greater Manchester did not have the power to implement a ban on fracking. \u201cThat\u2019s a reflection of government policy and not our policy. We would if we could,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are doing what we can within the legal structures that we have got at our disposal.\u201d</p> \n<p>The policy will be announced on Monday as part of the Greater Manchester spatial framework, which sets out a strategic plan for the city region until 2037. Local leaders have agreed to include concerns about the impacts arising from the exploitation of new sources of hydrocarbons. They believe the government\u2019s support for fracking means there is less of an imperative to invest in new zero-carbon technologies.</p> \n<p>In September 2018, the petrochemical company Ineos <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-scotland-ineos/scottish-government-wins-fracking-case-against-energy-giant-ineos-idUKKBN1JF1H8\">lost a legal challenge</a> against the Scottish government\u2019s position on fracking, when Scotland\u2019s highest court ruled politicians had not exceeded their powers by imposing a moratorium against fracking for oil and gas.</p> \n<p>Burnham said he was hopeful that energy companies would respect Greater Manchester\u2019s wishes and not apply to frack in the region. \u201cThere has never been a legal case involving a spatial framework of this kind. We would be empowering our own communities to take on a government policy which at times seems to impose its will on local communities,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Energy industry analysts have begun to question the economic feasibility of fracking in the UK. Since 2013, gas prices have fallen sharply and there is no shortage of supply in Europe or across the world. German import prices \u2013 the standard European benchmark \u2013 are half their 2013 level.

      "bodyText": "Ministers are facing a fresh confrontation with local councils over their controversial plans to expand fracking, after one of the biggest combined authorities in the country set out plans to ban the practice. Greater Manchester\u2019s decision to effectively stop companies from extracting underground shale gas in the region was greeted as a critical moment in the fight against fracking, which critics say is dangerous and unproven. The 10 local authorities that make up Greater Manchester will put planning measures in place to create a \u201cpresumption\u201d against fracking for shale gas, said the area\u2019s mayor, Andy Burnham, as part of its effort to become carbon neutral by 2038. The announcement, which comes as London finalises a similar scheme, will amplify discontent among local councils \u2013 including Tory-controlled authorities \u2013 that experts said could lead to a showdown with central government, and potentially kill off ministers\u2019 plans. Concerns about the drilling technique were again raised in the run-up to Christmas when the energy company Cuadrilla was forced to pause operations near Blackpool three times after drilling caused small earthquakes that breached legal limits. Several other authorities \u2013 including Leeds, Wakefield, Hull and York \u2013 have expressed opposition to fracking, and experts believe the stance taken by Manchester and London will embolden others. Many Conservatives are also opposed. In Westminster, almost two dozen Tory MPs are reported to be against fracking and willing to \u201cdestroy the government\u2019s majority\u201d if it tries to weaken planning laws. Several Tory-run local authorities \u2013 including Derby, Dorset and Nottinghamshire \u2013 are fiercely opposed to the change in planning proposals, which would mean companies could drill test sites without applying for planning permission. Manchester\u2019s decision echoes similar policies already pursued by the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales. Scottish government has a shale gas moratorium and the Welsh government has promised to block any applications. Tom Fyans from the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), said Greater Manchester\u2019s policy was a significant moment. \u201cThe decision is symbolic of the growing opposition to the government\u2019s plans to fast-track fracking, which look to override local democracy by disregarding the wishes of local communities and deny those very people the opportunity to have their say on decisions that will ultimately affect them and the health of their countryside,\u201d he said. Burnham said: \u201cIt\u2019s about embracing the future, not the past. Cities like Greater Manchester need to join the group of leading cities on the world stage that are driving fast towards carbon neutrality. \u201cThat is a big challenge and it must be embraced wholeheartedly, and it means a full commitment to renewable energy and not half measures, and not clinging on to processes that hark back to a past.\u201d In London, the city\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, who last month declared a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d, has said he will throw out all fracking proposals. His draft London plan, which will be ratified later this year, introduces an effective ban on fracking across the capital. Tony Bosworth of Friends of the Earth said: \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that they are opposed by local councils around the country, including many controlled by the Conservatives. In order to deal with the climate crisis, we need to be moving away from fossil fuels, not making it easier for companies to dig up more.\u201d The scale of opposition within the Conservative party was underlined last year when a survey commissioned by CPRE and Friends of the Earth found 80% of Conservative councillors in areas where fracking companies have a licence believe planning applications should be required before drilling. About 2.6 million people live in Greater Manchester, large parts of which are within \u201cshale-prospective areas\u201d identified by the British Geological Survey and the Oil and Gas Authority. Energy companies have been granted licences to pursue oil and gas exploration in the west and north of the region, with iGas the first to drill a combined coalbed methane and shale gas exploration well in Barton Moss in Salford in 2013-14. The combined authority\u2019s proposals on fracking are part of a wider, more ambitious environmental plan. Manchester city council, one of its10 local authorities, has already agreed to the goal after accepting advice from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. The wider region is expected to follow suit soon. Cities such as Berlin, Boston, Copenhagen, London and New York have joined the the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance, pledging to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80%-100% by 2050 or sooner. Burnham said the decision to move against fracking came about after council leaders looked at what happened in Lancashire, where fracking started in October at Preston New Road near Blackpool against the will of the local authority after a government intervention. The earthquakes caused by the Cuadrilla activity were a serious concern, Burnham said. \u201cFor the legal limits to be breached so regularly is a worry, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s hard to know what damage is being done and the effect that is having on groundwater and all of those other issues that emerge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s even more worrying in Greater Manchester, which is a much more urban place, where there is more contaminated land, more mine shafts. This is an industry which hasn\u2019t proven its case. In fact, the opposite.\u201d Burnham accepted that Greater Manchester did not have the power to implement a ban on fracking. \u201cThat\u2019s a reflection of government policy and not our policy. We would if we could,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are doing what we can within the legal structures that we have got at our disposal.\u201d The policy will be announced on Monday as part of the Greater Manchester spatial framework, which sets out a strategic plan for the city region until 2037. Local leaders have agreed to include concerns about the impacts arising from the exploitation of new sources of hydrocarbons. They believe the government\u2019s support for fracking means there is less of an imperative to invest in new zero-carbon technologies. In September 2018, the petrochemical company Ineos lost a legal challenge against the Scottish government\u2019s position on fracking, when Scotland\u2019s highest court ruled politicians had not exceeded their powers by imposing a moratorium against fracking for oil and gas. Burnham said he was hopeful that energy companies would respect Greater Manchester\u2019s wishes and not apply to frack in the region. \u201cThere has never been a legal case involving a spatial framework of this kind. We would be empowering our own communities to take on a government policy which at times seems to impose its will on local communities,\u201d he said. Energy industry analysts have begun to question the economic feasibility of fracking in the UK. Since 2013, gas prices have fallen sharply and there is no shortage of supply in Europe or across the world. German import prices \u2013 the standard European benchmark \u2013 are half their 2013 level. It is also not yet proven that the substantial shale resources present under the the north of England and elsewhere in the UK can be recovered at a commercially viable volume, as in the US. The government\u2019s determination to press ahead with fracking in light of mounting evidence of climate breakdown has also been criticised by leading scientists. Jim Hansen, known as the father of climate change awareness, accused ministers of ignoring scientific fact. However, the government had defended the practice. A Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said: \u201cShale gas has the potential to be a new domestic energy source, enhancing our energy security and delivering economic benefits, including the creation of well-paid, quality jobs.\u201d",

The action by US authorities came two months after the Serious Fraud Office in the UK abandoned its investigation into the case, a long-running loan scandal that pushed Mozambique into financial crisis when it first emerged five years ago. The US is seeking to charge the former bankers in connection with conspiracy to violate anti-bribery laws, money laundering and securities fraud.

The men arrested on Thursday in London were named as Andrew Pearse, Surjan Singh and Detelina Subeva, who were arrested in connection with allegations of defrauding investors. US prosecutors allege the former Credit Suisse bankers intentionally circumvented antifraud measures set in place by their employer between 2011 and 2013 in order to set up and execute the fraud, while using personal emails to conceal their involvement.

I imagined back then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/10/president-trump-brexit-which-worse-britain-votes-leave-hammer-blow-peace\" title=\"\">the devil offering progressive types one wish</a>: they could either have Britain stay in the European Union or see Donald Trump lose the US presidential election. But they could not have both. I wrote then that, forced to make that diabolical choice, I\u2019d opt for a remain victory in the referendum. Though four years of Trump would be a nightmare, Brexit would haunt us for generations.</p> \n<p>In the end, of course, Satan had the last laugh and we got saddled with both. But as I look across the Atlantic, I think my instinctive choice was probably right. Of course, it\u2019s far too early to make predictions about 2020, and whether US voters will seize their chance to kick Trump out after four years. But what\u2019s already clear is that the forces devoted to opposing America\u2019s 2016 horror \u2013 Trump \u2013 are doing a better job than the forces opposing ours, Brexit.</p> \n<p>For one thing, the anti-Trumpers have already won a public vote. On Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/03/democrats-government-shutdown-congress-legislation\" title=\"\">Nancy Pelosi returned</a> as speaker of the House of Representatives following Democratic victories last November. The mood was celebratory on Capitol Hill as newly elected Democrats took their seats, revelling in their diversity and plurality, with more women and people of colour than ever before.</p> \n<p>Some Democrats are anxious about the year ahead, as more than 30 possible contenders for the party\u2019s presidential nomination jostle and compete. But the coming contest could equally be viewed as proof of the party\u2019s vigorous good health, with a deep bench of talent, whether older and experienced figures like Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden, or younger and charismatic ones, such as Kamala Harris and Beto O\u2019Rourke.</p> \n<p>For now, though, the Democrats control one half of America\u2019s lawmaking body, giving them the power to thwart, slow down and interrogate the Trump administration.On Friday, they unveiled a package of measures they called the For the People Act, which took aim at some of the more blatant Trumpian excesses, tightening lobbying rules and demanding presidential candidates release their tax returns. Now they chair House committees, Democrats will have the power to question, and subpoena the Trump inner circle, probing their way through the corruption allegations that surround this president. The most tangible form of opposition, however, is the one that\u2019s led to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/03/government-workers-shutdown-stories-trump\" title=\"\">shutdown</a> of about a quarter of the federal government, now entering its third week. For the funding tap to be turned back on, both Trump and Congress have to agree on spending bills \u2013 and Trump insists that they include $5bn for his wall on the Mexican border. The Democrats refuse to give him that money. (Besides, didn\u2019t Trump promise that the Mexicans would pay for it?) They say the wall is wrong in principle and a spectacular waste of money \u2013 and they refuse to have any part of it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5ae8a99b-22ac-477a-9b2a-b5ee5734d0a9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P8QWY8iBRxs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Now contrast all that with the situation in Britain.

No. Not even in the face of daily evidence that this is a similarly doomed venture. It could be Michael Gove, he of the 2016 leave campaign, warning that a no-deal crash-out from the EU on 29 March would lead to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1080891694881665026\" title=\"\">tariffs on beef and sheep meat</a> of more than 40%.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m suffering from a bad case of opposition envy. Perhaps you missed this only-recently- discovered malady, among all the new year detox supplements and guides \u201cto a new you\u201d. In which case, let me fill you in. Spool back to the early summer of 2016, when twin horrors loomed on the horizon: Brexit and Trump. I imagined back then the devil offering progressive types one wish: they could either have Britain stay in the European Union or see Donald Trump lose the US presidential election. But they could not have both. I wrote then that, forced to make that diabolical choice, I\u2019d opt for a remain victory in the referendum. Though four years of Trump would be a nightmare, Brexit would haunt us for generations. In the end, of course, Satan had the last laugh and we got saddled with both. But as I look across the Atlantic, I think my instinctive choice was probably right. Of course, it\u2019s far too early to make predictions about 2020, and whether US voters will seize their chance to kick Trump out after four years. But what\u2019s already clear is that the forces devoted to opposing America\u2019s 2016 horror \u2013 Trump \u2013 are doing a better job than the forces opposing ours, Brexit. For one thing, the anti-Trumpers have already won a public vote. On Thursday, Nancy Pelosi returned as speaker of the House of Representatives following Democratic victories last November. The mood was celebratory on Capitol Hill as newly elected Democrats took their seats, revelling in their diversity and plurality, with more women and people of colour than ever before. Some Democrats are anxious about the year ahead, as more than 30 possible contenders for the party\u2019s presidential nomination jostle and compete. But the coming contest could equally be viewed as proof of the party\u2019s vigorous good health, with a deep bench of talent, whether older and experienced figures like Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden, or younger and charismatic ones, such as Kamala Harris and Beto O\u2019Rourke. For now, though, the Democrats control one half of America\u2019s lawmaking body, giving them the power to thwart, slow down and interrogate the Trump administration.On Friday, they unveiled a package of measures they called the For the People Act, which took aim at some of the more blatant Trumpian excesses, tightening lobbying rules and demanding presidential candidates release their tax returns. Now they chair House committees, Democrats will have the power to question, and subpoena the Trump inner circle, probing their way through the corruption allegations that surround this president. The most tangible form of opposition, however, is the one that\u2019s led to the shutdown of about a quarter of the federal government, now entering its third week. For the funding tap to be turned back on, both Trump and Congress have to agree on spending bills \u2013 and Trump insists that they include $5bn for his wall on the Mexican border. The Democrats refuse to give him that money. (Besides, didn\u2019t Trump promise that the Mexicans would pay for it?) They say the wall is wrong in principle and a spectacular waste of money \u2013 and they refuse to have any part of it. Now contrast all that with the situation in Britain. Does the opposition here say that the signature project of the May government \u2013 Brexit \u2013 is wrong in principle, and a spectacular waste of money? Does it refuse to have any part of it? No. Not even in the face of daily evidence that this is a similarly doomed venture. It could be Michael Gove, he of the 2016 leave campaign, warning that a no-deal crash-out from the EU on 29 March would lead to tariffs on beef and sheep meat of more than 40%. Or Chris Grayling, reassuring us that it\u2019s fine to hand over \u00a313.8m of taxpayers\u2019 money to a ferry company with no ferries, even as Ramsgate begins emergency dredging to become once again a deeper-water port in a matter of weeks. Or Britain\u2019s universities, in effect one of the country\u2019s most successful exports, attracting the best and brightest from Europe and beyond, reporting a drop in take-up of places and warning that no-deal represents \u201cone of the biggest threats\u201d they\u2019ve ever faced. Despite all this, and the undeniable truth that Brexit has always been a project of the nationalist right \u2013 a fact of which we shall be vividly reminded by Channel 4\u2019s Brexit drama on Monday night \u2013 Labour\u2019s stance has been to hem and haw, to be a little bit leave and a little bit remain, as it maintains its awkward perch on the Brexit fence. Never mind the data that shows Labour members overwhelmingly oppose Brexit, the party leader \u2013 who won the job by promising to listen to party members \u2013 told the Guardian before Christmas that even if Labour won a 2019 election, he would still go ahead with Brexit. This week Jeremy Corbyn disappointed those who would like to see Labour back a second referendum by appearing to add yet another stage in the much-vaunted sequence of moves that would lead him to call for a public vote \u2013 suggesting that if Theresa May\u2019s deal is rejected in the Commons then that should be the cue for renegotiating a new deal with the EU, as if such a thing were possible before the crash-out deadline in nine weeks. \u201cMost Labour MPs want someone to make a decision,\u201d says one member of the shadow cabinet. \u201cLeadership is about taking these decisions, and that of course has been lacking.\u201d Imagine if Pelosi showed similarly tortured hesitation towards Trump and his wall, fearful of opposing it outright because, after all, Trump had won an election, thanks in part to his success in traditionally Democratic states. Yet that has been Labour\u2019s position since 2016, terrified by those Labour seats that backed leave. It\u2019s resulted in the absurdity of Labour policy being a \u201cjobs-first Brexit\u201d: you might as well call for a patients-first disease.

They know a wall is a bad idea, and they are opposing it with a clear voice. Just as they know that Trump is doing to the US what Brexit is doing to Britain: weakening the country and trashing its reputation abroad.

With the increasing use of low-flying drones, we can perhaps expect the law to develop in this area.\u201d</p> <p>Identifying the owners of registered drones is simple, she said. \u201cThe challenge though is to identify rogue perpetrators \u2013 or those who currently have no obligation to registration. In practice that can be difficult.\u201d</p> <p>Many people say the warnings to ministers were long in the offing. Lord Harris, in his review of London\u2019s preparedness to respond to a major terrorist incident, highlighted the potential for drones to disrupt flights.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"caf0e2ad35f15db9d087677c0ca1751745267512\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caf0e2ad35f15db9d087677c0ca1751745267512/0_299_4900_2940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A drone flying near a block of flats\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The government\u2019s drone regulations have been criticised as too little, too late.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Arnold/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/22/gatwick-horses-stable-doors-drones-legislation-uk-government\">Writing for the Observer</a> last month, he said: \u201cI was by no means the first. The year before, a House of Lords committee issued similar warnings, as had academics, technical experts and airline pilots.</p> <p>\u201cA few months ago the government finally made it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/30/drone-rules-made-law-to-reduce-threat-to-aircraft\" title=\"\">illegal to fly a drone above 400ft</a> or within a kilometre of an airport. This was too little, too late and the penalties nothing like sufficient to stop those responsible from creating havoc with the holiday plans of thousands of families last week.\u201d</p> <p>The Labour party is calling for a full inquiry into the Gatwick chaos. Andy McDonald, Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, said: \u201cThe government has neither understood nor fully assessed the risk posed by drones to the UK\u2019s national infrastructure. It has not undertaken anything like appropriate contingency planning. And it has not prepared properly, despite protective technology being available.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that drones should not be able to get anywhere near an airport before being taken down. But the government has dithered and delayed on regulating drones.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe delay in bringing forward legislation is indicative of this government\u2019s failure to concentrate on the day-to-day business in front of them. They have taken their eye off the ball. The scale of disruption is unacceptable and it demands that we find out how this was allowed to happen, which is why Labour are calling for an independent inquiry.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/03/heathrow-and-gatwick-millions-anti-drone-technology\">it emerged that both Gatwick and Heathrow</a> will spend millions of pounds on anti-drone equipment in the wake of the December incident. While a spokeswoman for Gatwick would not say exactly what equipment had been installed since the drone chaos, she said the airport\u2019s owners had bought a system that provided a similar level of protection to the hardware provided by the military and had installed it about a week ago. Heathrow\u2019s spokeswoman also confirmed the reports of its investment in military-grade anti-drone equipment were accurate.</p> <p>Chris Grayling is understood to have chaired a meeting of police, aviation and defence chiefs on Thursday to discuss what lessons can be learned. The transport secretary spoke with the chief constable of Sussex police, along with representatives from the Ministry of Defence, the Metropolitan police, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Home Office.</p> <p>It is understood the aviation minister, Lady Sugg, who was also present at the meeting, will meet with the heads of all UK airports next week to discuss their counter-drone strategies.</p> <p>The lack of progress by the police has led to criticism from some. Katy Bourne, the police and crime commissioner for Sussex, defended the response.</p> <p>\u201cSadly, we have seen further examples of those armed with a little knowledge seeking to exploit the incident as a failure of policing,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not something I recognise.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed, the approach being taken by Sussex police in both the investigation and prevention measures has been first class given the extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances within which they have been operating. Even the Met police have said that they would not be doing anything differently.</p> <p>\u201cThe rush to find answers has blinded some commentators to where the real focus of concerns should be \u2013 our national capacity to tackle drone incursions and how information and assets are shared and deployed.\u201d</p>",

There have been some legislative changes to deal with drones but ultimately experts say these will not help to identify rogue operators. \u201cThe civil law is not really adequate to address the risk of drones,\u201d said Alison Oldfield, a real estate litigation partner from law firm Eversheds Sutherland. \u201cIt only gives a property owner the right to use the airspace above his land to such height as is necessary for the \u2018ordinary use and enjoyment\u2019 of his land. \u201cWhat that means in practice in this context is untested but is generally thought to be confined to a fairly limited height above the ground. With the increasing use of low-flying drones, we can perhaps expect the law to develop in this area.\u201d Identifying the owners of registered drones is simple, she said. \u201cThe challenge though is to identify rogue perpetrators \u2013 or those who currently have no obligation to registration. In practice that can be difficult.\u201d Many people say the warnings to ministers were long in the offing. Lord Harris, in his review of London\u2019s preparedness to respond to a major terrorist incident, highlighted the potential for drones to disrupt flights. Writing for the Observer last month, he said: \u201cI was by no means the first. The year before, a House of Lords committee issued similar warnings, as had academics, technical experts and airline pilots. \u201cA few months ago the government finally made it illegal to fly a drone above 400ft or within a kilometre of an airport. This was too little, too late and the penalties nothing like sufficient to stop those responsible from creating havoc with the holiday plans of thousands of families last week.\u201d The Labour party is calling for a full inquiry into the Gatwick chaos. Andy McDonald, Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, said: \u201cThe government has neither understood nor fully assessed the risk posed by drones to the UK\u2019s national infrastructure. It has not undertaken anything like appropriate contingency planning. And it has not prepared properly, despite protective technology being available. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that drones should not be able to get anywhere near an airport before being taken down. But the government has dithered and delayed on regulating drones.\u201d He added: \u201cThe delay in bringing forward legislation is indicative of this government\u2019s failure to concentrate on the day-to-day business in front of them. They have taken their eye off the ball. The scale of disruption is unacceptable and it demands that we find out how this was allowed to happen, which is why Labour are calling for an independent inquiry.\u201d On Thursday, it emerged that both Gatwick and Heathrow will spend millions of pounds on anti-drone equipment in the wake of the December incident. While a spokeswoman for Gatwick would not say exactly what equipment had been installed since the drone chaos, she said the airport\u2019s owners had bought a system that provided a similar level of protection to the hardware provided by the military and had installed it about a week ago. Heathrow\u2019s spokeswoman also confirmed the reports of its investment in military-grade anti-drone equipment were accurate. Chris Grayling is understood to have chaired a meeting of police, aviation and defence chiefs on Thursday to discuss what lessons can be learned. The transport secretary spoke with the chief constable of Sussex police, along with representatives from the Ministry of Defence, the Metropolitan police, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Home Office. It is understood the aviation minister, Lady Sugg, who was also present at the meeting, will meet with the heads of all UK airports next week to discuss their counter-drone strategies. The lack of progress by the police has led to criticism from some. Katy Bourne, the police and crime commissioner for Sussex, defended the response. \u201cSadly, we have seen further examples of those armed with a little knowledge seeking to exploit the incident as a failure of policing,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not something I recognise. \u201cIndeed, the approach being taken by Sussex police in both the investigation and prevention measures has been first class given the extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances within which they have been operating. Even the Met police have said that they would not be doing anything differently. \u201cThe rush to find answers has blinded some commentators to where the real focus of concerns should be \u2013 our national capacity to tackle drone incursions and how information and assets are shared and deployed.\u201d",

But after reports of antisemitic chanting after Chelsea\u2019s fixture at Brighton before Christmas and at Arsenal\u2019s defeat to Tottenham in the Carabao Cup, the WJC and BOD urged supporters to \u201ctake a stand\u201d against abusive language.</p> <p>\u201cContrary to the protests of many fans, there is no grey area when it comes to slurs that target a particular religious, racial or ethnic group,\u201d said the WJC CEO and executive vice-president, Robert Singer. \u201cThe word \u2018Yid\u2019 has for years been reappropriated from its original Yiddish to carry a distinctly pejorative and antisemitic message, and its use by fans in the stands, either as a self-designated nickname or as a slogan against rivals must not be tolerated in any way.</p> <p>\u201cThere has sadly been a long history of hooliganism and extremist behaviour within football, particularly in England, and we hope that the actions being taken in good faith by Chelsea\u2019s leadership to take punitive measures against any supporters that violate this code of conduct will help establish the groundwork for more tolerance among fans of all teams.</p> <p>\u201cWe would also ask Tottenham Hotspur to take a stand against the use of \u2018Yid Army\u2019, \u2018Yid\u2019 and \u2018Yiddos\u2019 by their fans.

      "bodyText": "The World Jewish Congress and the Board of Deputies of British Jews have condemned Tottenham Hotspur supporters\u2019 use of the nickname \u201cYids\u201d and called for fans to take a stand against using the term during matches. Three Spurs fans were arrested in 2014 for using the word during a Europa League game, with the Football Association and anti-racism group Kick It Out having repeatedly urged supporters not to use it. But after reports of antisemitic chanting after Chelsea\u2019s fixture at Brighton before Christmas and at Arsenal\u2019s defeat to Tottenham in the Carabao Cup, the WJC and BOD urged supporters to \u201ctake a stand\u201d against abusive language. \u201cContrary to the protests of many fans, there is no grey area when it comes to slurs that target a particular religious, racial or ethnic group,\u201d said the WJC CEO and executive vice-president, Robert Singer. \u201cThe word \u2018Yid\u2019 has for years been reappropriated from its original Yiddish to carry a distinctly pejorative and antisemitic message, and its use by fans in the stands, either as a self-designated nickname or as a slogan against rivals must not be tolerated in any way. \u201cThere has sadly been a long history of hooliganism and extremist behaviour within football, particularly in England, and we hope that the actions being taken in good faith by Chelsea\u2019s leadership to take punitive measures against any supporters that violate this code of conduct will help establish the groundwork for more tolerance among fans of all teams. \u201cWe would also ask Tottenham Hotspur to take a stand against the use of \u2018Yid Army\u2019, \u2018Yid\u2019 and \u2018Yiddos\u2019 by their fans. Such a long overdue action is important to kick antisemitism off the pitch and create a welcoming environment for all.\u201d A supporter was ejected from the Emirates Stadium following a physical altercation in the North Bank after being accused of making numerous antisemitic references during Spurs\u2019 2-0 win at Arsenal in December.",

His new club go to Newcastle on Saturday sitting fourth in the Premiership with the second fewest tries conceded despite not yet having managed back-to-back victories. A top-four finish and Quins\u2019 decision to recruit Gustard will clearly have been vindicated.</p> <p>His time under Jones, if nothing else, sharpened him up mentally. \u201cEddie is the most observant coach I\u2019ve met. There\u2019s no waiting or standing on ceremony. It\u2019s simply: \u2018This doesn\u2019t look right. Why?\u2019 That\u2019s the question he asks more than any other. Why?

I do things a little bit differently. I\u2019m not a one trick pony: it\u2019s not just about getting a wolf in. As a coach you\u2019re essentially a teacher as well as a salesman. Can I get people to buy in? Everyone\u2019s got knowledge, it\u2019s about how well you transmit that information.\u201d</p> <p>As a north-east lad, brought up in a hamlet just outside Blaydon on the road to Consett and the son of the prolific former Gosforth winger Steve Gustard, this is also a personally significant weekend in other respects. Gustard was born and educated in Newcastle and was taught plenty by Richards during his time at Leicester. \u201cI remember myself, Martin Corry and Lewis Moody practising mauling in training. Dean had come out to watch: the next thing we knew he had taken his teeth out, picked the three of us up \u2013 and we weren\u2019t small blokes \u2013 and just ripped the ball off us. It was fucking embarrassing.\u201d</p> <p>There was also the time the Tigers clinched a league title at Bristol. \u201cI remember on the way back being pinned down by Dean and Darren Garforth. He ripped my shirt off and started stubbing me with a cigar. He was laughing away but he\u2019s a good man really, Deano.\u201d Winning in Bath during Gustard\u2019s first season remains another vivid memory.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a favourite bar where Dean liked to go, mainly to take the shit out of the Bath fans. We were a bit raucous and this huge bloke comes across saying: \u2018Richards, I want to arm-wrestle you.\u2019 Dean goes: \u2018I am too good for you, you want Austin Healey.\u2019 Little did this monster know Austin was an unbelievable arm wrestler. They did one arm \u2013 boom, straight down \u2013 then the other, at which point Austin dropped the nut on him. It was like the wild west.\u201d</p> <p>Different times. In the modern era coaches crave iron discipline and having banned Dave Ward for treading on Wasps\u2019 Thomas Young last weekend, Gustard wants a cleaner contest in the north-east. \u201cOne of our mantras is that we want people to come and watch Harlequins and say: \u2018That\u2019s a tough, competitive, resilient team but they do it right.\u2019 The big thing for us now is wins on the road. If we can\u2019t get them we\u2019re going to be in the shitfight with everyone else.\u201d</p> <p>If he is nursing any England withdrawal symptoms, he hides them well.</p>",

It was fucking embarrassing.\u201d There was also the time the Tigers clinched a league title at Bristol. \u201cI remember on the way back being pinned down by Dean and Darren Garforth. He ripped my shirt off and started stubbing me with a cigar. He was laughing away but he\u2019s a good man really, Deano.\u201d Winning in Bath during Gustard\u2019s first season remains another vivid memory. \u201cThere was a favourite bar where Dean liked to go, mainly to take the shit out of the Bath fans. We were a bit raucous and this huge bloke comes across saying: \u2018Richards, I want to arm-wrestle you.\u2019 Dean goes: \u2018I am too good for you, you want Austin Healey.\u2019 Little did this monster know Austin was an unbelievable arm wrestler. They did one arm \u2013 boom, straight down \u2013 then the other, at which point Austin dropped the nut on him. It was like the wild west.\u201d Different times. In the modern era coaches crave iron discipline and having banned Dave Ward for treading on Wasps\u2019 Thomas Young last weekend, Gustard wants a cleaner contest in the north-east. \u201cOne of our mantras is that we want people to come and watch Harlequins and say: \u2018That\u2019s a tough, competitive, resilient team but they do it right.\u2019 The big thing for us now is wins on the road. If we can\u2019t get them we\u2019re going to be in the shitfight with everyone else.\u201d If he is nursing any England withdrawal symptoms, he hides them well.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Indianapolis Colts (No6 seed) @ Houston Texans (No3 seed). Saturday, 4.35pm ET/9.35pm GMT</strong></h2> <p><strong>What the Colts need to do to win:</strong> Andrew Luck needs to change his <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2019/1/3/18166753/andrew-luck-playoff-issues-frank-reich-houston-texans-nfl-wild-card\">postseason narrative</a>. Luck\u2019s resurgence after missing last season with injury has been a key reason why the Colts were able to sneak into the playoffs. Now he needs to change his, well, luck during the postseason. Luck has had more interceptions in the playoffs than any other quarterback since 2012 and has been generally less effective during the postseason than in the regular season.</p> <p><strong>What the Texans need to do to win</strong>: The Houston Texans need to protect Deshaun Watson. The Texans\u2019 offensive line has been horribly porous, allowing more than 60 sacks this season, and had the <a href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/2019/01/01/colts-texans-odds-picks-betting-preview\">worst opposing sack rate in the league</a>. The Colts alone have racked up 12 during their last two meetings with Houston. It\u2019s hard to score when your QB is constantly on their back.</p> <p><strong>Key player</strong>: <strong>JJ Watt, DE, Texans</strong>. It\u2019s not often that the first-round of the playoffs features two potential Comeback Player of the Year candidates facing each other, but that\u2019s what we\u2019ll have when <a href=\"https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/nfl/colts/2018/12/06/andrew-luck-v-j-j-watt-comeback-poy-contenders-square-off/2194447002/\">Watt is on Luck </a>during Saturday\u2019s contest. Watt missed most of last season with a leg injury, but has been back at full strength this year.</p> <p><strong>Prediction: </strong>Colts 17-13 Texans</p> <h2><strong>Seattle Seahawks (No5 seed) @ Dallas Cowboys (No4 seed). Saturday, 8.15pm ET/ 1.15am Sunday GMT</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc27fdc832ab2d2e473391c48bcb655a0b333b59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc27fdc832ab2d2e473391c48bcb655a0b333b59/80_0_3280_1968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russell Wilson is attempting to win the second Super Bowl of his career.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russell Wilson is attempting to win the second Super Bowl of his career.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Froschauer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What the Seahawks need to do to win</strong>: The Seahawks have to stop the Cowboys\u2019 running game, which is easier said than done when it comes to containing Ezekiel Elliott. When the two teams <a href=\"https://seahawkswire.usatoday.com/2019/01/01/seahawks-run-defense-will-need-to-step-up-to-beat-cowboys/\">faced each other earlier this season</a>, Elliott had 16 carries and rushed for 127 yards but didn\u2019t score a touchdown. The Seahawks weren\u2019t great defensively that day, but they held on to the win. They\u2019d take that again in a heartbeat during the playoffs.</p> <p><strong>What the Cowboys need to do to win</strong>: Can they escape the ghosts of the past? The last time these two teams met during wildcard weekend, the Cowboys played their way out of a potential game-winning field goal when Tony Romo\u2019s <a href=\"https://touchdownwire.usatoday.com/2018/12/31/cowboys-fans-still-have-nightmares-over-lone-playoff-meeting-with-seahawks/\">botched hold on the snap</a> sealed a 21-20 Seahawks victory. The Cowboys have had a reputation as choke artists ever since and if something goes wrong, fans at JerryWorld may start expecting things to unravel. They can\u2019t let that get to them.</p> <p><strong>Key player</strong>: <strong>Ezekiel Elliott, RB, Cowboys</strong>. Elliott is Dallas\u2019s most dynamic player, he ran for 1,434 yards this season, the most in the league. Dallas <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25663275/ezekiel-elliott-saturday-wild-card-game-vs-seahawks-ready-go-right-now\">kept him out</a> of the regular season finale against the New York Giants, meaning that he\u2019s well rested for the rest of the postseason. The Cowboys will lean on him hard.</p> <p><strong>Prediction: </strong>Seahawks 16-20 Cowboys</p> <h2>Los Angeles Chargers (No5 seed) @ Baltimore Ravens (No4 seed). Sunday, 1.05pm ET/6.05pm GMT</h2> <p><strong>What the Chargers need to do to win</strong>: The Chargers need to learn from their mistakes. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/game?gameId=401030897\">The Chargers lost 22-10</a> when they battled the Ravens just a few weeks ago. Normally one would think that would be a bad sign, but this was a learning opportunity for LA, who basically get a chance for a do-over on a much bigger stage.</p> <p><strong>What the Ravens need to do to win</strong>: Baltimore are going to want to take care of the ball. While they have improved with rookie Lamar Jackson as their quarterback, Jackson has had <a href=\"https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/lamar-jackson-s-next-challenge-protect-the-football\">ball security issues</a>. Jackson is an elite runner, but he\u2019s still working on his pass accuracy. This wouldn\u2019t be a huge issue if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he\u2019s also had 10 fumbles on the season. One costly turnover could make all the difference on Sunday.</p> <p><strong>Key player</strong>:<strong> Philip Rivers, QB. Chargers</strong>. When it comes to elite passers, Rivers is never in the same conversation as Tom Brady, Peyton Manning or Drew Brees <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2019/1/3/18166771/philip-rivers-chargers-playoffs-super-bowl-career-legacy\">even though he should be</a>. The main reason is that he\u2019s never even participated in the Super Bowl. This is one of his last chances, but he\u2019s going to need to win every game on the road from here on out. Baltimore\u2019s dominant defense is going to make for a tough challenge.</p> <p><strong>Prediction: </strong>Chargers 17-20 Ravens</p> <h2>Philadelphia Eagles (No6 seed) @ Chicago Bears (No3 seed). Sunday, 4.40pm ET/9.40pm GMT</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"639f33f9cd2963e67dcd6fec2218f2517c7b4939\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/639f33f9cd2963e67dcd6fec2218f2517c7b4939/0_35_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Foles finds himself in a leading role in the playoffs once again\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Foles finds himself in a leading role in the playoffs once again.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Szagola/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What the Eagles need to do to win</strong>: Rely on <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2019/1/3/18166088/philadelphia-eagles-nick-foles-playoff-superhero\">Nick Foles\u2019s magic?</a> At this point it\u2019s ridiculous to think that the Eagles\u2019 backup QB can keep leading them to victory whenever Carson Wentz goes down. But, hey, it keeps happening so why not keep believing? After earning Super Bowl MVP honors last year, Foles came in for Wentz again this season and helped the Eagles rattle off three straight wins to make the postseason.</p> <p><strong>What the Bears needs to do to win</strong>: They need to play the same defense that got them here. Quarterback Mitchell Trubisky has been just about everything the team could have hoped for this season, but it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/03/ditkaland-dispatches-why-chicago-should-rethink-its-80s-nostalgia\">never about the offense</a> in Chicago. When the Bears win it\u2019s because they have an elite defense, and this time around it\u2019s no different. Bolstered by the Khalil Mack trade, Chicago\u2019s defense is ranked third in the league and primed to turn Foles back into a pumpkin.</p> <p><strong>Key player</strong>: <strong>Khalil Mack, OLB, Chicago Bears</strong>. The Bears traded two first-round picks to the Oakland Raiders to get Mack and then gave him a six-year/$141m contract, making him <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-khalil-mack-magical-season-htmlstory.html\">the highest paid defender</a> in NFL history. He ended the year with 12.5 sacks, 47 tackles and a handful of key takeaways. Looks like he was worth it.</p> <p><strong>Prediction: </strong>Eagles 16-21 Bears</p>",

The Colts alone have racked up 12 during their last two meetings with Houston. It\u2019s hard to score when your QB is constantly on their back. Key player: JJ Watt, DE, Texans. It\u2019s not often that the first-round of the playoffs features two potential Comeback Player of the Year candidates facing each other, but that\u2019s what we\u2019ll have when Watt is on Luck during Saturday\u2019s contest. Watt missed most of last season with a leg injury, but has been back at full strength this year. Prediction: Colts 17-13 Texans Seattle Seahawks (No5 seed) @ Dallas Cowboys (No4 seed). Saturday, 8.15pm ET/ 1.15am Sunday GMT What the Seahawks need to do to win: The Seahawks have to stop the Cowboys\u2019 running game, which is easier said than done when it comes to containing Ezekiel Elliott. When the two teams faced each other earlier this season, Elliott had 16 carries and rushed for 127 yards but didn\u2019t score a touchdown. The Seahawks weren\u2019t great defensively that day, but they held on to the win. They\u2019d take that again in a heartbeat during the playoffs. What the Cowboys need to do to win: Can they escape the ghosts of the past? The last time these two teams met during wildcard weekend, the Cowboys played their way out of a potential game-winning field goal when Tony Romo\u2019s botched hold on the snap sealed a 21-20 Seahawks victory. The Cowboys have had a reputation as choke artists ever since and if something goes wrong, fans at JerryWorld may start expecting things to unravel. They can\u2019t let that get to them. Key player: Ezekiel Elliott, RB, Cowboys. Elliott is Dallas\u2019s most dynamic player, he ran for 1,434 yards this season, the most in the league. Dallas kept him out of the regular season finale against the New York Giants, meaning that he\u2019s well rested for the rest of the postseason. The Cowboys will lean on him hard. Prediction: Seahawks 16-20 Cowboys Los Angeles Chargers (No5 seed) @ Baltimore Ravens (No4 seed). Sunday, 1.05pm ET/6.05pm GMT What the Chargers need to do to win: The Chargers need to learn from their mistakes. The Chargers lost 22-10 when they battled the Ravens just a few weeks ago. Normally one would think that would be a bad sign, but this was a learning opportunity for LA, who basically get a chance for a do-over on a much bigger stage. What the Ravens need to do to win: Baltimore are going to want to take care of the ball. While they have improved with rookie Lamar Jackson as their quarterback, Jackson has had ball security issues. Jackson is an elite runner, but he\u2019s still working on his pass accuracy. This wouldn\u2019t be a huge issue if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he\u2019s also had 10 fumbles on the season. One costly turnover could make all the difference on Sunday. Key player: Philip Rivers, QB. Chargers. When it comes to elite passers, Rivers is never in the same conversation as Tom Brady, Peyton Manning or Drew Brees even though he should be. The main reason is that he\u2019s never even participated in the Super Bowl. This is one of his last chances, but he\u2019s going to need to win every game on the road from here on out. Baltimore\u2019s dominant defense is going to make for a tough challenge. Prediction: Chargers 17-20 Ravens Philadelphia Eagles (No6 seed) @ Chicago Bears (No3 seed). Sunday, 4.40pm ET/9.40pm GMT What the Eagles need to do to win: Rely on Nick Foles\u2019s magic? At this point it\u2019s ridiculous to think that the Eagles\u2019 backup QB can keep leading them to victory whenever Carson Wentz goes down. But, hey, it keeps happening so why not keep believing? After earning Super Bowl MVP honors last year, Foles came in for Wentz again this season and helped the Eagles rattle off three straight wins to make the postseason. What the Bears needs to do to win: They need to play the same defense that got them here. Quarterback Mitchell Trubisky has been just about everything the team could have hoped for this season, but it\u2019s never about the offense in Chicago. When the Bears win it\u2019s because they have an elite defense, and this time around it\u2019s no different. Bolstered by the Khalil Mack trade, Chicago\u2019s defense is ranked third in the league and primed to turn Foles back into a pumpkin. Key player: Khalil Mack, OLB, Chicago Bears. The Bears traded two first-round picks to the Oakland Raiders to get Mack and then gave him a six-year/$141m contract, making him the highest paid defender in NFL history. He ended the year with 12.5 sacks, 47 tackles and a handful of key takeaways. Looks like he was worth it. Prediction: Eagles 16-21 Bears",

      "body": "<p>How can you be sure a horse is a horse? Usually, it is obvious, but no more so than on screen, when you often hear it neigh. And it\u2019s driving at least one equestrian-minded ITV viewer mad.</p> <p>IMDb-user sarahjgodley \u201cthoroughly enjoyed\u201d the recent adaptation of Vanity Fair, according to her online review <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mere_lyn/status/1080000685830225920\" title=\"\">that went viral last week</a>: \u201cEXCEPT for the usual flaw in historical dramas \u2026 Every single time a horse appears on screen, you hear a neigh, even though it\u2019s apparent that the horse in question is not neighing \u2013 it\u2019s like hearing the sound of a dog barking although the dog shown has its mouth shut.\u201d</p> <p>It seemed always to be \u201cthe same bloody horse, too\u201d, sarahjgodley writes, with mounting heat: \u201cThe only time a horse makes a sound like that is when it\u2019s a stallion which has the scent of an in-season mare.\u201d Not only does this disregard the emotional state of the animal \u2013 whether it is feeling pensive or full of hubris, melancholic, amused or just numb \u2013 horses seldom neigh at all. \u201cFor them, it\u2019s long-distance communication they don\u2019t often use.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomewhere in the mists of time\u201d, she thinks, a sound engineer recorded the cry of one randy stud and used it to voice every horse on screen.</p> <p>Sound designer Roland Heap, director of the London-based post-production company Sound Disposition, says that may not be far from the case. \u201cThere are only a few thousand sound-effect libraries, and however many million hours of content being created each year \u2013 it\u2019s inevitable there\u2019s some repetition.\u201d</p> <p>But a sound designer\u2019s aim is not so much to reflect reality as to evoke an emotional response. In this case, Heap explains, that may mean where there\u2019s a horse, there\u2019s a neigh. \u201cCats meow all the time when they\u2019re on screen. Dogs bark when you don\u2019t see them barking,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the nature of film sound that quite often we are a little bit \u2018show and tell\u2019. You look at the screen and go: \u2018What would the audience expect to hear?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The broader soundscape is another factor. \u201cOften a director will want to make the sound seem busier, and the first thing we\u2019ll do is look at a scene: there is a horse on screen, therefore we can justify the sound of a horse.\u201d Then, Heap says: \u201cYou want to go to a horse that sounds distinctively like a horse\u201d \u2013 or rather, what people think of as sounding distinctively like a horse, regardless of the reality.</p> <p>\u201cDirectors may ask: \u2018Why isn\u2019t that horse making an exciting noise? Why can\u2019t I hear that horse?\u2019,\u201d Heap says. \u201cIt\u2019s more about capturing the essence of what\u2019s going on. The worlds we create in sound are far more interesting and clear than the reality, which is generally a bit of a mush.\u201d</p> <p>He gives the example of a sword being drawn: although they were historically kept in a leather scabbard lest they become blunted, viewers expect to hear metal (running a spatula along a pole can achieve the effect). \u201cIt\u2019s all storytelling, in sound as much as anything else \u2013 everything in film sound is a lie.\u201d</p> <p>Cars seen on screen rarely correspond to the engines heard; gentle caresses land like floor-tom thuds.

      "bodyText": "How can you be sure a horse is a horse? Usually, it is obvious, but no more so than on screen, when you often hear it neigh. And it\u2019s driving at least one equestrian-minded ITV viewer mad. IMDb-user sarahjgodley \u201cthoroughly enjoyed\u201d the recent adaptation of Vanity Fair, according to her online review that went viral last week: \u201cEXCEPT for the usual flaw in historical dramas \u2026 Every single time a horse appears on screen, you hear a neigh, even though it\u2019s apparent that the horse in question is not neighing \u2013 it\u2019s like hearing the sound of a dog barking although the dog shown has its mouth shut.\u201d It seemed always to be \u201cthe same bloody horse, too\u201d, sarahjgodley writes, with mounting heat: \u201cThe only time a horse makes a sound like that is when it\u2019s a stallion which has the scent of an in-season mare.\u201d Not only does this disregard the emotional state of the animal \u2013 whether it is feeling pensive or full of hubris, melancholic, amused or just numb \u2013 horses seldom neigh at all. \u201cFor them, it\u2019s long-distance communication they don\u2019t often use.\u201d \u201cSomewhere in the mists of time\u201d, she thinks, a sound engineer recorded the cry of one randy stud and used it to voice every horse on screen. Sound designer Roland Heap, director of the London-based post-production company Sound Disposition, says that may not be far from the case. \u201cThere are only a few thousand sound-effect libraries, and however many million hours of content being created each year \u2013 it\u2019s inevitable there\u2019s some repetition.\u201d But a sound designer\u2019s aim is not so much to reflect reality as to evoke an emotional response. In this case, Heap explains, that may mean where there\u2019s a horse, there\u2019s a neigh. \u201cCats meow all the time when they\u2019re on screen. Dogs bark when you don\u2019t see them barking,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the nature of film sound that quite often we are a little bit \u2018show and tell\u2019. You look at the screen and go: \u2018What would the audience expect to hear?\u2019\u201d The broader soundscape is another factor. \u201cOften a director will want to make the sound seem busier, and the first thing we\u2019ll do is look at a scene: there is a horse on screen, therefore we can justify the sound of a horse.\u201d Then, Heap says: \u201cYou want to go to a horse that sounds distinctively like a horse\u201d \u2013 or rather, what people think of as sounding distinctively like a horse, regardless of the reality. \u201cDirectors may ask: \u2018Why isn\u2019t that horse making an exciting noise? Why can\u2019t I hear that horse?\u2019,\u201d Heap says. \u201cIt\u2019s more about capturing the essence of what\u2019s going on. The worlds we create in sound are far more interesting and clear than the reality, which is generally a bit of a mush.\u201d He gives the example of a sword being drawn: although they were historically kept in a leather scabbard lest they become blunted, viewers expect to hear metal (running a spatula along a pole can achieve the effect). \u201cIt\u2019s all storytelling, in sound as much as anything else \u2013 everything in film sound is a lie.\u201d Cars seen on screen rarely correspond to the engines heard; gentle caresses land like floor-tom thuds. Animals are always making \u201cthe most exciting sound that animal can possibly make\u201d \u2013 for birds of prey and \u201cHollywood frogs\u201d, it is often the same regardless of species. \u201cThe red-tailed hawk cry is an absolute classic,\u201d says Heap. \u201cI\u2019ve used that countless times.

It is plain daft to list the things this money could be used for, as it is \u201csunk costs\u201d. Once a GP surgery is scheduled, it incurs a set of fixed costs \u2013 the wages of the GP and other staff, the running of the building etc.</p> <p>Even if no patients turn up, these costs have been incurred and the money isn\u2019t available for an alternative use.</p> <p>Bearing in mind that most GP consultations end up with a prescription or a referral, I would argue that each missed appointment probably represents a saving to the NHS. Nor should we be worried that a missed appointment leaves the GP twiddling their thumbs. I always used the time to do paperwork or just get back on schedule, meaning that subsequent patients had a shorter wait.</p> <p>Using the term \u201cwasted\u201d implies fecklessness on the part of the patient, which is seldom the case. It is more likely that they are struggling to balance family and work demands, have been let down by transport arrangements \u2013 or are too ill to attend.</p> <p>If you want to address waste in the NHS, I would suggest that getting rid of NHS England would be a good starting point.<br><strong>Dr Christopher Price</strong><br><em>Retired GP, Norwich</em></p> <p>\u2022 I understand why the measure of missed GP appointments might be expressed in terms of cost.

      "bodyText": "NHS England claims that missed GP appointments cost the NHS \u00a3216m each year (Money wasted on missed GP slots could fund 2,300 doctors, 2 January). While it is frustrating for those struggling to get a timely GP appointment to hear that 15m appointments are lost in this way, it is very misleading to attach a monetary value to a missed appointment. It is plain daft to list the things this money could be used for, as it is \u201csunk costs\u201d. Once a GP surgery is scheduled, it incurs a set of fixed costs \u2013 the wages of the GP and other staff, the running of the building etc. Even if no patients turn up, these costs have been incurred and the money isn\u2019t available for an alternative use. Bearing in mind that most GP consultations end up with a prescription or a referral, I would argue that each missed appointment probably represents a saving to the NHS. Nor should we be worried that a missed appointment leaves the GP twiddling their thumbs. I always used the time to do paperwork or just get back on schedule, meaning that subsequent patients had a shorter wait. Using the term \u201cwasted\u201d implies fecklessness on the part of the patient, which is seldom the case. It is more likely that they are struggling to balance family and work demands, have been let down by transport arrangements \u2013 or are too ill to attend. If you want to address waste in the NHS, I would suggest that getting rid of NHS England would be a good starting point. Dr Christopher Price Retired GP, Norwich \u2022 I understand why the measure of missed GP appointments might be expressed in terms of cost. However, it is ludicrous to draw up a wishlist of how any money saved might be spent. There is no single cause of this problem and ideally all missed appointments should be explained, but don\u2019t be fooled into thinking that the effect is anything other than to allow those who do turn up a little more of our time.

      "bodyText": "The high value of blue badges is inevitable as they are not marked with a car registration, for very good reasons (Blue badge thefts rise by 45% in England, 30 November). This issue came to my notice, via harassed constituents, when I was a councillor in Lambeth (sometimes memorialised in the Society section of this newspaper) over a decade ago. One constituent\u2019s blue badge was being repeatedly stolen from her car overnight \u2013 hasslesome enough, but then there were also the parking tickets assiduously issued the next morning. We came up with a ludicrously simple solution that I now offer to the nation: Lambeth issued (I wonder if it still does?) its own disabled badges, valid only in Lambeth but printed with the car\u2019s registration. This meant that when used overnight or on a local trip, the badge was rendered valueless to a thief. Not a universal solution, but I imagine it would, if nationally applied by each council, cut theft \u2013 and the subsequent fraud \u2013 in half. If not more.

      "bodyText": "A couple who were stabbed during an attack at Manchester Victoria station on New Year\u2019s Eve have said they hope the incident does not \u201cdivide communities or create tensions\u201d. The man and woman, both in their 50s, sustained multiple stab wounds in the suspected terrorist attack on the station concourse. They remain in hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries. In a statement released by Greater Manchester police (GMP), the couple thanked the officers who \u201cran into danger to protect us\u201d. Sgt Lee Valentine of British Transport Police (BTP) was also stabbed after he ran to arrest a suspect near the Metrolink platforms A and B. He has since been released from hospital to recover at home. \u201cWe would like to thank the men and women from British Transport Police who ran into danger to protect us, as well as the paramedics and hospital employees who have shown great care and skill in looking after us,\u201d the couple said. \u201cWe also want to say thank you to GMP for their ongoing support, our families for their care and concern, our friends and the wider public. We hope this incident does not divide communities or create tensions. Now we would like to be left in peace to make a full recovery.\u201d On Wednesday police said the injured man had made \u201cgood progress\u201d and was expected to be released from hospital soon. \u201cHis partner is also making progress but is expected to be in hospital for longer,\u201d the force said. Since the incident it has emerged that the 25-year-old man suspect was known to mental health services. \u201cThere\u2019s often an underlying mental health problem when someone commits anything of this kind,\u201d a source close to the investigation said. The suspect was not known to counter-terrorism police, the source added. The suspect was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and remains detained under the Mental Health Act in a secure medical facility. On Wednesday his family released a statement saying they were praying for the three victims. Greater Manchester police said a counter-terrorism investigation remained ongoing. On Wednesday police finished searching the suspect\u2019s house and said they were \u201cincreasingly confident that the man acted alone in the final stages of the attack\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Two years after its inception, 10,000 bitcoin was just about enough to buy a <a href=\"https://qz.com/1285209/bitcoin-pizza-day-2018-eight-years-ago-someone-bought-two-pizzas-with-bitcoins-now-worth-82-million/\">couple of takeaway pizzas</a>. Today those bitcoin would be worth nearly $38m (\u00a330m). That is a huge increase, but just a fraction of their $180m value only 13 months ago, because since its creation a decade ago this week, the digital currency has been at the centre of one of the biggest economic bubbles in history.</p> <p>Bitcoin has had a wild ride since its birth on 3 January 2009. Created as a digital currency to sidestep the traditional finance industry using encrypted code, it took until May 2010 for the first reported purchase using bitcoin to take place: those two large Papa John\u2019s pizzas worth $30 for 10,000 bitcoins.</p> <p>But in recent years bitcoin has become less useful as a medium of exchange and more famous for its boom-bust tendencies \u2013 drawing parallels to the Dutch tulip mania of 1637 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/07/rbs-sir-howard-davies-bitcoin-dantes-inferno-digital-currency\">Dante\u2019s Inferno</a> for its ability to lose investors millions of pounds.</p> <p>It surged by more than 1,000%, sometimes gaining $2,500 in a single day, to stand at almost $20,000 just before Christmas 2017. But the digital currency then crumpled over the course of last year, and yesterday stood at just $3,780, having wiped out many investments on the way down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2019-01-04T16:12:25/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Bitcoin's boom and bust\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2019-01-04T16:12:25/embed.html\">Bitcoin's boom and bust</a> </figure>  <p>Nouriel Roubini, one of the few economists to predict the 2008 financial crash and a former White House economic adviser is one of Bitcoin\u2019s most vocal critics. He has called it the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/bitcoin-biggest-bubble-in-history-says-economist-who-predicted-2008-crash\">mother of all bubbles</a>\u201d and tweeted last month that it,and other crypto copycats like Ethereum and Litecoin, should be ranked in a \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/1079709868238557184\">2018 Shitcoin Hall/Pile of Manure Shame</a>\u201d.</p> <p>But despite the cautionary warnings from mainstream economists, as well as the finance industry labelling bitcoin a vehicle for scammers, crooks and terrorists, there are still legions of cryptocurrency fans, with an online cottage industry of news websites, blogs and podcasts.</p> <p>The digital currency launched as more than just an opportunity for investors to make millions (before losing them almost equal amounts). The technology underlying it has excited businesses, while the growth of cryptocurrencies promised another future for its fans outside the traditional financial system.</p> <p>At its launch a decade ago, the very first block of bitcoin was etched with a subversive statement: \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d</p> <p>The message from its creator \u2013 an unknown person or group of people going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto \u2013 was clear: bitcoin would exist outside of a system that had failed badly and could no longer be trusted.</p> <p>The idea came straight from the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@hayekian/how-bitcoin-spreads-austrian-economics-and-thus-worldwide-intellectual-revolution-9df49929725d\">Austrian school of economics</a> with a pinch of left-wing anarchism thrown in for good measure \u2013 offering individual liberty and a way to avoid the grasp of government, while sidestepping corporate power and the banking system.</p> <p>The birth of the digital currency represented a return to the days of private money in the earlier stages of western economic development, with a parallel to wildcat banks in the mid 19th century as the US expanded westward, when railway companies and construction firms issued thousands of banknotes between them.</p> <p>Scores of bitcoin copycats have emerged, hoping to ride the wave of euphoria evident in 2017, launched through initial coin offerings (ICOs) that in several cases turned out to be fraudulent scams.</p> <p>As with the age of private money, which led governments to create monopolies over currency under the auspices of the central banking system, in order to gain state control and to protect consumers from firms and individuals unable to repay the holders of their notes, bitcoin also appears to be heading for a more tightly regulated future.</p> <p>The UK government is poised to give sweeping new powers over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/20/bitcoin-may-be-overseen-by-uks-financial-regulator\">digital currencies to the Financial Conduct Authority</a>, after MPs warned that it and other cryptocurrencies were akin to the \u201cwild west\u201d and exposed consumers to various risks. Central banks including the Bank of England are <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/digital-currencies\">examining cryptocurrencies</a>, while some countries have looked to create their own.</p> <p>Despite losing some investors millions of pounds, the bitcoin boom and bust has also attracted attention to its underlying technology \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/10/blockchain-music-imogen-heap-provenance-finance-voting-amir-taaki\">the blockchain</a> \u2013 which may be used to revolutionise the way companies handle payments or transfer information.</p> <p>Kiran Nagaraj of the accountancy firm KPMG said company executives increasingly ask about how they can use digital currencies or blockchain technology. \u201cCredit to bitcoin, it created an awareness. The 2018 bear market will help create better quality services and products for the whole space overall,\u201d he said.</p> <p>There are fears however that the institutional wave of investors that rushed to buy cryptocurrencies last year may slowly melt away. JP Morgan has warned that more <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-18/pros-are-ditching-bitcoin-market-as-interest-ebbs-jpmorgan-says\">professionals are ditching bitcoin than investing</a>. After the launch of bitcoin futures on the Chicago Board Options Exchange a year ago \u2013 viewed by enthusiasts as its arrival in the mainstream \u2013 trading interest has slumped.</p> <p>Wild estimates were made for the future value of bitcoin a year ago. John McAfee, the software security company founder, predicted it would reach $500,000 by the end of 2020.

      "bodyText": "Two years after its inception, 10,000 bitcoin was just about enough to buy a couple of takeaway pizzas. Today those bitcoin would be worth nearly $38m (\u00a330m). That is a huge increase, but just a fraction of their $180m value only 13 months ago, because since its creation a decade ago this week, the digital currency has been at the centre of one of the biggest economic bubbles in history. Bitcoin has had a wild ride since its birth on 3 January 2009. Created as a digital currency to sidestep the traditional finance industry using encrypted code, it took until May 2010 for the first reported purchase using bitcoin to take place: those two large Papa John\u2019s pizzas worth $30 for 10,000 bitcoins. But in recent years bitcoin has become less useful as a medium of exchange and more famous for its boom-bust tendencies \u2013 drawing parallels to the Dutch tulip mania of 1637 and Dante\u2019s Inferno for its ability to lose investors millions of pounds. It surged by more than 1,000%, sometimes gaining $2,500 in a single day, to stand at almost $20,000 just before Christmas 2017. But the digital currency then crumpled over the course of last year, and yesterday stood at just $3,780, having wiped out many investments on the way down. Nouriel Roubini, one of the few economists to predict the 2008 financial crash and a former White House economic adviser is one of Bitcoin\u2019s most vocal critics. He has called it the \u201cmother of all bubbles\u201d and tweeted last month that it,and other crypto copycats like Ethereum and Litecoin, should be ranked in a \u201c2018 Shitcoin Hall/Pile of Manure Shame\u201d. But despite the cautionary warnings from mainstream economists, as well as the finance industry labelling bitcoin a vehicle for scammers, crooks and terrorists, there are still legions of cryptocurrency fans, with an online cottage industry of news websites, blogs and podcasts. The digital currency launched as more than just an opportunity for investors to make millions (before losing them almost equal amounts). The technology underlying it has excited businesses, while the growth of cryptocurrencies promised another future for its fans outside the traditional financial system. At its launch a decade ago, the very first block of bitcoin was etched with a subversive statement: \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d The message from its creator \u2013 an unknown person or group of people going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto \u2013 was clear: bitcoin would exist outside of a system that had failed badly and could no longer be trusted. The idea came straight from the Austrian school of economics with a pinch of left-wing anarchism thrown in for good measure \u2013 offering individual liberty and a way to avoid the grasp of government, while sidestepping corporate power and the banking system. The birth of the digital currency represented a return to the days of private money in the earlier stages of western economic development, with a parallel to wildcat banks in the mid 19th century as the US expanded westward, when railway companies and construction firms issued thousands of banknotes between them. Scores of bitcoin copycats have emerged, hoping to ride the wave of euphoria evident in 2017, launched through initial coin offerings (ICOs) that in several cases turned out to be fraudulent scams. As with the age of private money, which led governments to create monopolies over currency under the auspices of the central banking system, in order to gain state control and to protect consumers from firms and individuals unable to repay the holders of their notes, bitcoin also appears to be heading for a more tightly regulated future. The UK government is poised to give sweeping new powers over digital currencies to the Financial Conduct Authority, after MPs warned that it and other cryptocurrencies were akin to the \u201cwild west\u201d and exposed consumers to various risks. Central banks including the Bank of England are examining cryptocurrencies, while some countries have looked to create their own. Despite losing some investors millions of pounds, the bitcoin boom and bust has also attracted attention to its underlying technology \u2013 the blockchain \u2013 which may be used to revolutionise the way companies handle payments or transfer information. Kiran Nagaraj of the accountancy firm KPMG said company executives increasingly ask about how they can use digital currencies or blockchain technology. \u201cCredit to bitcoin, it created an awareness. The 2018 bear market will help create better quality services and products for the whole space overall,\u201d he said. There are fears however that the institutional wave of investors that rushed to buy cryptocurrencies last year may slowly melt away. JP Morgan has warned that more professionals are ditching bitcoin than investing. After the launch of bitcoin futures on the Chicago Board Options Exchange a year ago \u2013 viewed by enthusiasts as its arrival in the mainstream \u2013 trading interest has slumped. Wild estimates were made for the future value of bitcoin a year ago. John McAfee, the software security company founder, predicted it would reach $500,000 by the end of 2020. The Winklevoss twins, who have invested significant sums in bitcoin, argued it could end up matching gold in value, meaning a price above $320,000 and total market capitalisation of at least $4tn. The argument went that prices only exist for any given asset because society agrees it is worth that amount, and why should bitcoin be any different, even if it lacks physical properties. But while gold also has limited utility to justify its value, unlike bitcoin the precious metal has been held in high regard for millennia. At the start of its 10th year, predictions for Bitcoin\u2019s future are modest. Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at the currency trading firm Oanda, is moderately optimistic: \u201cA bit of risk is still in the air but I\u2019m starting to warm up to the upside now \u2026 we could see $5,000 and even a push to $6,000 on a convincing enough break of the key $5,000 mark.\u201d Clement Thibault, senior analyst at Investing.com, reckons investor confidence has been shot for the time being: \u201cI believe too many would-be early adopters got burned badly last year, and once an asset has been labeled a bubble, a gamble, or a speculative investment, it takes time to rebuild the trust and appeal needed to push the asset forward.\u201d There are still those, like Roubini, who believe bitcoin could \u2013 or should \u2013 be wiped out entirely, while Teunis Brosens of the Dutch bank ING, reckons it will just disappear into relative obscurity: \u201cThis time last year I wrote a note saying [bitcoin] will become a niche asset,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to say I think that view aged well.\u201d",

Elsewhere popular pundit Richard Keys has had his say on the officiating on social media disgrace Twitter. \u201cThe PGMOL must STOP appointing Anthony Taylor to games involving Manchester clubs,\u201d Keysie decreed. \u201cHe takes baggage onto the pitch &amp; can\u2019t officiate evenly as a result.\u201d</p> <p>The Fiver can remember a time when people would talk about the football after an absorbing game between two title-chasing sides. In the internet era, however, it seems everyone just wants to focus on bias and agendas and referees. Midway through the first half, City captain Ryan Shawcross scythed through Mohamed Salah and sent the Liverpool forward flying into the air. It wasn\u2019t quite as strong a challenge on Salah as that ferocious one by Paul Dummett on Boxing Day, but Liverpool were staggered to see Shawcross receive no more than a yellow card.

Rumour has it that Guardiola is lining up a January move for Rory Delap. Andy Carroll might also be available this month and the West Ham forward could be a good option for a side shifting away from silken-footed possession football and moving towards an all-out long-ball English attritional grind as they attempt to chase Liverpool down after moving four points behind the leaders.</p> <p>That\u2019s one conclusion to draw from one isolated game anyway, and if you really fancied getting carried away, you could observe that Liverpool are starting to crack up, with Nathaniel Clyne wisely escaping the sinking ship and heading to Bournemouth on loan. But the Fiver doesn\u2019t have time for all that. It\u2019s a goalline technology truther these days and is too busy studying photos of John Stones\u2019s clearance off the line.

      "bodyText": "HOOFERS AND TRUTHERS Tinfoil hat enthusiasts have been in business since Manchester City beat Liverpool in the greatest game anyone can remember since Pep Guardiola and J\u00fcrgen Klopp invented football in 2018. Weird Uncle Fiver was straight on the phone at full-time, ranting away about CGI shadows, dark conspiracies within the corridors of power at the Ferguson Association and the moment when Guardiola proved himself to be an enemy of the environment by attacking the grass with his scarf. Elsewhere popular pundit Richard Keys has had his say on the officiating on social media disgrace Twitter. \u201cThe PGMOL must STOP appointing Anthony Taylor to games involving Manchester clubs,\u201d Keysie decreed. \u201cHe takes baggage onto the pitch &amp; can\u2019t officiate evenly as a result.\u201d The Fiver can remember a time when people would talk about the football after an absorbing game between two title-chasing sides. In the internet era, however, it seems everyone just wants to focus on bias and agendas and referees. Midway through the first half, City captain Ryan Shawcross scythed through Mohamed Salah and sent the Liverpool forward flying into the air. It wasn\u2019t quite as strong a challenge on Salah as that ferocious one by Paul Dummett on Boxing Day, but Liverpool were staggered to see Shawcross receive no more than a yellow card. Why hadn\u2019t he tackled like Virgil van Dijk on Dries Mertens, roared the Red Men? Amid the disappointment and frustration, at least Liverpool could reflect on forcing City to play like a deluxe version of Pulis-era Stoke, with little Bernardo Silva stomping around midfield like a Portuguese Glenn Whelan, Sergio Ag\u00fcero leading the line like Jonathan Walters and Aymeric Laporte a rigid, immovable, stolid, stern presence at left-back. Rumour has it that Guardiola is lining up a January move for Rory Delap. Andy Carroll might also be available this month and the West Ham forward could be a good option for a side shifting away from silken-footed possession football and moving towards an all-out long-ball English attritional grind as they attempt to chase Liverpool down after moving four points behind the leaders. That\u2019s one conclusion to draw from one isolated game anyway, and if you really fancied getting carried away, you could observe that Liverpool are starting to crack up, with Nathaniel Clyne wisely escaping the sinking ship and heading to Bournemouth on loan. But the Fiver doesn\u2019t have time for all that. It\u2019s a goalline technology truther these days and is too busy studying photos of John Stones\u2019s clearance off the line. You watch, one day the story will emerge. The conspiracy is real. Buy tinfoil. You won\u2019t regret it. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Paul Doyle from 7.45pm GMT for hot FA Cup MBM coverage of Tranmere 1-3 Tottenham.

At the end of that 2016-17 season, Lincoln were promoted back to the Football League as National League champions.</p> <p>Saturday\u2019s trip to Goodison Park has a similar feel in that ahead of another big game for the club, the Imps are again challenging for promotion as the current leaders of League Two.</p> <p>\u201cThe cup run two years ago helped the team win promotion,\u201d said Cowley. \u201cIt fast-tracked us and we improved as a team and a squad as a consequence of that run and that experience. It\u2019s going to be a great experience again on Saturday and we\u2019ll learn loads about the group, which I hope will stand us in good stead. </p> <p>\u201cWhen you play against the best, they test you technically and tactically and always find weaknesses that perhaps you didn\u2019t know about. We like the feedback these sorts of games create for us. So we want to try to have a good run in the cup again because we\u2019ve shown it can be done side by side with a good run in the league.</p> <p>\u201c[In 2017] everyone in the National League was telling us it would get in the way and eventually catch up with us, but what people don\u2019t realise is it helped us win the league because when it got to the business end of the season in the league we had already lived big games in the FA Cup and been in those pressure situations.

There\u2019s no guarantee on that. We want to re-focus on this game. It\u2019s important. We want to keep that mentality and that winning mentality is a really important thing.\u201d</p> <p>Burnley had won only once in 12 games when they beat West Ham 2-0 last Sunday, and coming from behind to win at Huddersfield on Wednesday evening only increased the level of confidence within the dressing room.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been difficult,\u201d said Dyche. \u201cIt\u2019s been tricky over the last few months, but I think the feel has remained the same and there\u2019s been a good feel and a solid feel to the group in the mentality. But nothing reinforces it more than wins, of course, because that\u2019s what footballers live for. They live to win games - that\u2019s part of their lives - as do I as a manager, as do my staff and of course the fans as well. Without any doubt, when you are winning, it does add that edge of confidence to what you are trying to do.\u201d</p> <p>Burnley will be without the suspended Robbie Brady following his red card in midweek, but could welcome back goalkeeper Nick Pope, defender Stephen Ward and midfielder Steven Defour from injury, with Dyche indicating he is likely to use the depth of his squad. \u201cWe have got a more competitive group now and the team that we put out, I think, can win games and particularly this game,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they have got to deliver a performance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a44807adc2ae415266d1ee41f21759f71528e491\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a44807adc2ae415266d1ee41f21759f71528e491/0_238_2650_1590/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sean Dyche\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burnley manager Sean Dyche.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Kearns/CameraSport via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-04T14:22:37.558Z\">at 2.22pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c2f52fbe4b02fb91ff0e237\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-04T12:35:54.526Z\">12.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A Chelsea legend tweets ...</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Kingcanners/status/1081156961985544200\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cSeriously think it\u2019s time football clubs and players all came together to say enough is enough with all hate crime.

It is just the same if we had won,\u201d said the Scotland captain. \u201cIt would have been nice to be 10 points clear of them and nine points above Tottenham but we wouldn\u2019t have won [the title by winning the game]. We have not lost it. They\u2019re obviously delighted, seeing their reaction at the end but they\u2019ve not won it either. We will fight right to the death.

We can use that to our advantage and we\u2019ll look forward to the games ahead now.\u201d <br><br><strong>On <em>that</em> potentially season-defining 11.7mm:</strong> \u201cI saw the picture of the one were Sadio hit the post and then the deflection - it was millimetres, but they\u2019re the fine margins,\u201d said Robertson. \u201cIf that goes in it might have been a completely different game. But they then scored before half-time and we needed to bounce back, which we did. I thought we were controlling the game at that point but we just left ourselves that wee bit too open and a team like City punish you.

Dominic Solanke has moved from Liverpool to Bournemouth for \u00a319m. No really, \u00a319m. Liverpool full-back Nathaniel Clyne is also on the verge of signing a six-month loan deal with the Cherries. Jermain Defoe has yet to finalise a loan deal with Rangers, which will take him to the end of his contract with Bournemouth. Football Weekly Extra ... Extra, in which we pick over the bones of last night\u2019s match between Liverpool and Manchester City is here Huddersfield Town are on the verge of signing Jason Puncheon from Crystal Palace. Stoke have spent a combined \u00a320m to make the loan signings of Ryan Woods and Benik Afobe permanent. Gianfranco Zola thinks Chelsea\u2019s Callum Hudson-Ndoi should reject Bayern Munich\u2019s advances The FA Cup third round kicks off tonight From the Guardian Sport Network: The FA Cup has scrapped another set of replays this season. Thirty years ago, clubs kept on playing until they found a winner. Words: Steven Pye. Done deal klaxon!!! Bournemouth pay Liverpool \u00a319m for Dominic Solanke. Crikey. Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 to China? Sky Sports News are reporting that Chinese Super League club Beijing Sinobo Guoan have enquired about the possibility of taking Belgian midfielder Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 off Tottenham\u2019s hands. The 31-year-old has made just seven Premier League starts for Tottenham this season and is expected to leave the club in January. Thierry Henry is also believed to be interested in bringing him to Monaco. Dominic Solanke to Bournemouth? Eddie Howe is ready to offer Dominic Solanke a chance to kick-start his stalled career at Bournemouth, in a deal that could be worth up to \u00a320m to Liverpool. The 21-year-old striker had been on the verge of a move to Crystal Palace, only for the deal to collapse yesterday, but now looks to be heading to Bournemouth, possibly on a permanent deal. Behind Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino, Mo Salah and Daniel Sturridge in the Liverpool pecking order, the centre-forward was always likely to struggle for game-time at Liverpool and will presumably begin life at Bournemouth as back-up for Callum Wilson, should his move materialise. Solanke moved to Liverpool from Chelsea on a free transfer in July 2017 and made 27 appearances in all competitions under Jurgen Klopp last season. He has yet to play for Liverpool in the current campaign. Christian Benteke latest: Crystal Palace\u2019s Christian Benteke has returned to training following his knee injury, but is not yet fit enough to start. \u201cBenteke trained, he\u2019s been back in training for a while, said Roy Hodgson on the Palace website. \u201c[Today] was the first real occasion that he joined the squad and trained from start to finish. A couple of times, he\u2019s joined in with the early parts of training and dropped out when things became more physical but [today] he joined in. Of his team\u2019s FA Cup match against Gr4imsby at Selhurst Park tomorrow, Hodgson had this to say. \u201cYou\u2019ll see a changed side but it\u2019s not just a case of bringing through younger players. We can\u2019t keep top, international players forever on the sidelines because we\u2019ve been lucky enough to have a very stable and consistent first XI. \u201cThere are a lot of players who are more than good enough to play in the Crystal Palace first team but they haven\u2019t had a chance. I\u2019m not using it [the Grimsby fixture] as an experimental occasion. I want to put a team out on the field that I think will win the game. We know that will never be easy because Grimsby will come here looking to upset the apple cart.\u201d Puncheon to Huddersfield Town latest: David Wagner expects Huddersfield to complete the loan signing of Jason Puncheon from Crystal Palace within the next 24 to 48 hours. The winger, 32, who has not started in the Premier League for Palace this season and is 0out of contract in June, will become Huddersfield\u2019s second transfer window signing following the arrival of defender Jadon Brown from Tottenham. \u201cWe are close and I\u2019m pretty confident this will be done in the next 24 to 48 hours,\u201d said Wagner, who refused to discuss any further targets. \u201cAll of them are contracted to other clubs and this is why I\u2019ve no idea if we are able to bring some further players in or not and once we\u2019ve done our business, or as close as we are with Jason, I will let you know.\u201d Just Say No dept: The Football Association has encouraged anyone with information about a potential anti-doping violation to come forward following a report an unnamed England player had been seen taking taken cocaine at a nightclub. On Friday, The Sun claimed that a Premier League player had taken the drug during a pre-Christmas get-together following an away game. According to the report, which quoted a club insider, the player, who was believed to be drunk by the team\u2019s \u201cirate\u201d manager, was later put into a taxi and taken home. Any player found to have breached the FA\u2019s social drugs policy regulations would be subject to sanctions, which begin from zero-to-three months suspension for a first offence but increases to potentially a lifetime ban for multiple breaches. \u201cThe FA operates one of the most comprehensive national anti-doping programmes in the world,\u201d said a statement. \u201cIn partnership with UK Anti-Doping, we have a targeted research and intelligence-led programme in place to identify potential doping risks in the game. Although incidents of doping in English football are very rare, it remains a priority for the FA to find and sanction anyone found taking performance-enhancing or recreational drugs. \u201cWe encourage anyone with information about any anti-doping violation in football to report it to the FA, via anti-dopingthefa.com, or to UK Anti-Doping by visiting www.reportdoping.com Nathaniel Clyne to Bournemouth: Unconfirmed reports are filtering through that Bournemouth have signed Liverpool full-back Nathaniel Clyne on loan from Liverpool until the end of the season. The 27-year-old from Stockwell in south-west London has made just two starts in five appearances so far this season and was also being chased by Cardiff City. With both Adam Smith and Simon Francis sidelined for the foreseeable future, Bournemouth were in need of a right-back and look to have landed their man. Andy Carroll unlikely to be sold in January: Manuel Pellegrini does not expect West Ham to sell Andy Carroll this January. Carroll\u2019s future remains uncertain as he turns 30 on Sunday and only has a contract until the end of the season. The injury-hit striker has figured sparingly this term and made his first start in a year against Brighton on Wednesday, only to be taken off at half-time. Nevertheless, when asked if he expected to lose Carroll this month, Hammers boss Pellegrini said it was unlikely. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Andy will stay here with us, he is an important player for our team. He is just coming back from a long, long injury, and the way he is taking advantage of his minutes he will return to the player that we all know.\u201d Carroll is expected to start in Saturday\u2019s FA Cup third-round meeting with Birmingham. Samir Nasri is also set to make his debut, having been an unused substitute in midweek. The 31-year-old former Manchester City and Arsenal midfielder joined the Hammers as a free agent on New Year\u2019s Eve once his 18-month doping ban was complete. Having played three games in seven days and with a lengthy injury list, Pellegrini will make further changes against the Championship play-off hopefuls. Cardiff City news: Neil Warnock will make wholesale changes for the FA Cup third-round tie at Gillingham. Fringe players such as goalkeeper Alex Smithies, defender Lee Peltier and wingers Nathaniel Mendez-Laing and Kadeem Harris are all in line to start, with Warnock expected to rest several Premier League regulars. Defenders Matt Connolly and Jazz Richards are both out with viruses, but the young trio of Cameron Coxe, James Waite and Lloyd Humphries will travel after impressing for the under-23 side. Provisional squad: Smithies, Murphy, Peltier, Bennett, Morrison, Manga, Cunningham, Ralls, Gunnarsson, Damour, Harris, Hoilett, Paterson, Reid, Murphy, Mendez-Laing, Coxe, Waite, Humphries. Danny Cowley speaks: The Lincoln boss believes an FA Cup tie against Everton will be a valuable learning curve that could help his side\u2019s League Two promotion challenge. Cowley\u2019s Imps created history two years ago when they became the first non-league club since 1914 to reach the quarter-finals of the competition. At the end of that 2016-17 season, Lincoln were promoted back to the Football League as National League champions. Saturday\u2019s trip to Goodison Park has a similar feel in that ahead of another big game for the club, the Imps are again challenging for promotion as the current leaders of League Two. \u201cThe cup run two years ago helped the team win promotion,\u201d said Cowley. \u201cIt fast-tracked us and we improved as a team and a squad as a consequence of that run and that experience. It\u2019s going to be a great experience again on Saturday and we\u2019ll learn loads about the group, which I hope will stand us in good stead. \u201cWhen you play against the best, they test you technically and tactically and always find weaknesses that perhaps you didn\u2019t know about. We like the feedback these sorts of games create for us. So we want to try to have a good run in the cup again because we\u2019ve shown it can be done side by side with a good run in the league. \u201c[In 2017] everyone in the National League was telling us it would get in the way and eventually catch up with us, but what people don\u2019t realise is it helped us win the league because when it got to the business end of the season in the league we had already lived big games in the FA Cup and been in those pressure situations. Hopefully the experience can have the same affect this season.\u201d Bad news for Sunderland fans: The club\u2019s leading scorer, Josh Maja, appears to have indicated he will not be signing the new contract offered to him by the club ... having previously indicated he would be inking the deal. The 20-year-old, whose breakthrough to the first team last season is chronicled in the Netflix docuseries Sunderland Til I Die, has bagged 14 goals for the League One side this season, seven more than the club\u2019s next most prolific scorer, Aiden McGeady. This, from Stewart Donald, the head of the consortium that bought the club last May. Maja is rumoured to have been offered seven times his current salary to stay at the club. Lend us your ears: Because last night\u2019s match between Manchester City and Liverpool was the biggest, most important game in the history of the Premier League, Max Rushden, Lars Sivertson, Philippe Auclair and yours truly convened in the studio this morning to pick over the bones of the contest. Here\u2019s what we thought ... Sean Dyche speaks: And Burnley\u2019s manager has been warning his players against complacency on the back of their recent two-match winning ... em, streak, as they prepare to face Barnsley in the FA Cup tomorrow afternoon. \u201cI like the idea of the momentum, of course, but we\u2019ve been in these competitions, we have been up and down and obviously this year more so with the Europa [League] as well, so I think we have adapted to the challenge. \u201cIt\u2019s been tough, but you can\u2019t guarantee that momentum remains purely because it\u2019s literally game after game. There\u2019s no guarantee on that. We want to re-focus on this game. It\u2019s important. We want to keep that mentality and that winning mentality is a really important thing.\u201d Burnley had won only once in 12 games when they beat West Ham 2-0 last Sunday, and coming from behind to win at Huddersfield on Wednesday evening only increased the level of confidence within the dressing room. \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult,\u201d said Dyche. \u201cIt\u2019s been tricky over the last few months, but I think the feel has remained the same and there\u2019s been a good feel and a solid feel to the group in the mentality. But nothing reinforces it more than wins, of course, because that\u2019s what footballers live for. They live to win games - that\u2019s part of their lives - as do I as a manager, as do my staff and of course the fans as well. Without any doubt, when you are winning, it does add that edge of confidence to what you are trying to do.\u201d Burnley will be without the suspended Robbie Brady following his red card in midweek, but could welcome back goalkeeper Nick Pope, defender Stephen Ward and midfielder Steven Defour from injury, with Dyche indicating he is likely to use the depth of his squad. \u201cWe have got a more competitive group now and the team that we put out, I think, can win games and particularly this game,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they have got to deliver a performance.\u201d A Chelsea legend tweets ... David Moyes to Stoke City? Speculation continues to mount that David Moyes is on the verge of being appointed manager of Stoke City, with the Potters\u2019 current boss, Gary Rowett, expected to be sacked following a poor run of form in which his side have won just one of their past five games. Jonny Williams signs for Charlton: The Crystal Palace and Wales midfielder has signed on a six-month loan deal permanently. One of the stars of the utterly compelling Sunderland Til I Die Netflix series, Williams came across as an absolutely lovely bloke ... unlike others I could mention. Yes you, Martin Bain. And you, Jack Rodwell. And you, Lewis Grabban. If you haven\u2019t seen Sunderland Til I Die yet, make it your business to do so. Here\u2019s a piece I wrote on it ... More post-match reaction: Our video team have been slaving over this clip of selected highlights from Pep and J\u00fcrgen\u2019s post-match press conferences, in which the Liverpool manager, unlike his Manchester City counterpart demonstrates that he has never learned that if you wear your coat, hat and scarf indoors, then you won\u2019t feel the benefit of them when you go outside. Andy Robertson has been talking: Considered a pre-match doubt last night as his girlfriend was due to give birth to the couple\u2019s second child, Liverpool defender Andy Robertson eventually lined up and played very well in defeat against Manchester City. Here\u2019s what he had to say after the game. On defeat: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything. It is just the same if we had won,\u201d said the Scotland captain. \u201cIt would have been nice to be 10 points clear of them and nine points above Tottenham but we wouldn\u2019t have won [the title by winning the game]. We have not lost it. They\u2019re obviously delighted, seeing their reaction at the end but they\u2019ve not won it either. We will fight right to the death. They\u2019ve closed the gap but it is all about how we react. On how he thinks Liverpool will react: \u201cIt is a new experience for all of us. We can use that to our advantage and we\u2019ll look forward to the games ahead now.\u201d On that potentially season-defining 11.7mm: \u201cI saw the picture of the one were Sadio hit the post and then the deflection - it was millimetres, but they\u2019re the fine margins,\u201d said Robertson. \u201cIf that goes in it might have been a completely different game. But they then scored before half-time and we needed to bounce back, which we did. I thought we were controlling the game at that point but we just left ourselves that wee bit too open and a team like City punish you. Credit goes to them but we are still four points clear at that is what we have got to remember.\u201d There\u2019s no word yet on whether or not how Rachel, Andy\u2019s better half, is getting on but we wish them both all the very best. FA Cup third round Looking at the weekend fixtures, you\u2019ve got to say it\u2019s an interesting draw. We have ... Seven Premier League sides playing away against lower league opposition. Chelsea play Nottingham Forest, who have eliminated the FA Cup holders on five of the six previous occasions they have faced them. We have just 10 games kicking off at 3pm on Saturday. There are also quite a few Premier League teams in action who I suspect won\u2019t be in the least bit fussed about advancing to the next round, as they\u2019ve more pressing concerns. And here they are: Gillingham v Cardiff, Burnley v Barnsley, Liverpool v Wolves, Derby v Southampton, Bristol City v Huddersfield, Fulham v Oldham. Good morning all (other time zones are available). Barry Glendenning here, fresh from recording a bonus episode of Football Weekly ... Extra ... Extra following last night\u2019s humdinger between Manchester City and Liverpool. Philippe Auclair, Lars Sivertson and myself picked over the bones of a terrific encounter with Max Rushden asking the probing questions and Producer Jonathan will have that up for your listening pleasure in a few hours, once he\u2019s whipped it into something resembling coherence. In the meantime, you can feast your ears on yesterday\u2019s Football Weekly podcast. And if you\u2019re not already a subscriber, please sign up in all the usual pod places. Southampton visit Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby in the apparently endangered 3pm GMT time slot tomorrow. The Press Association have team news from the Premier League side \u2026 Southampton should have full-back Matt Targett available again after a thigh problem for the FA Cup tie against Championship side Derby. Saints will be hoping the hamstring issue which forced striker Danny Ings to be replaced at half-time against Chelsea in midweek is nothing serious, but defender Maya Yoshida is definitely missing as he is on international duty with Japan. Defender Ryan Bertrand (back) and striker Michael Obafemi (hamstring) are doubts while midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg continues his suspension. Out of the corner of my eye, I see Mr Barry Glendenning is currently removing his coat \u2013 he\u2019ll be taking over from here. Email him on barry.glendenning@theguardian.com or tweet @bglendenning. Bye! Jonathan Wilson has weighed in on last night\u2019s game, and looks very closely at the early incident which shows how fine that old chestnut \u2013 the fine margin \u2013 can be where results are concerned \u2026 The world moves on. Technology develops and evolves. The aesthetics of the spectacle, perhaps, to our wearily nostalgic culture, have less to recommend them than they did, but accuracy at least is guaranteed. Where once epoch-defining line decisions were taken by Azerbaijani men with silver hair and splendid moustaches, now we watch a digital representation of a yellow circle landing on a white line across a green background. What Tofiq Bakhramov\u2019s decisive nod was to the 1966 World Cup, so Goal Decision System may be to the 2018-19 Premier League. Where the former remains contested (with good reason), there is no disputing what happened at the Etihad on Thursday. Or at least not beyond crazed conspiracists who within hours of the final whistle were already talking about shadows and angles and the grand anti-Liverpudlian plot that is geometry. Perhaps the technology isn\u2019t perfect. Perhaps the reading that said the ball was 11.7 millimetres from completely crossing the line is affecting an impossible level of accuracy, but it is still much more likely to be right than a 41-year-old former footballer from Baku. 11.7 millimetres. It\u2019s the length of a bluebottle, the thickness of a pocket diary, the width of the nail of a little finger. It is nothing on which to lose a football match, still less perhaps a championship. And there is a danger now that the measurement comes to haunt Liverpool as surely as Steven Gerrard\u2019s \u201cThis does not slip\u201d speech after another game against Manchester City, that when the history of this long title drought is written, the measurement 11.7 millimetres looms so large that every time Liverpool fans see a fly, check an appointment or catch a glimpse of their own hands they are reminded of defeat and failure. More transfer news from this morning \u2013 from one of the breakout stars of Netflix\u2019s Sunderland \u2018Til I Die \u2026 Jonny Williams has joined Charlton from Crystal Palace. From Charlton\u2019s statement announcing the move: \u201cCharlton Athletic are delighted to confirm the arrival of Wales international Jonny Williams on a permanent deal from Crystal Palace. \u201cThe 25-year-old midfielder has put pen to paper on a six-month contract at The Valley and becomes Lee Bowyer\u2019s first signing of the January transfer window.\u201d Meanwhile, through the transfer window \u2026 Eddie Howe has been talking before another of the septet of lunchtime games tomorrow, when his side host south-coast rivals Brighton. He straight-batted all talk of Jermain Defoe\u2019s expected move to Rangers. No deal has been finalised, so until that moment happens, it would be foolish of me to comment, so let\u2019s wait and see what happens in the next few days. Any deal which does get agreed will be in the player\u2019s best interest and what the player wants to pursue. \u201cFrom our side, I have said from day one, I love working with Jermain. The relationship we have had, how professional he has been and for the group of players. As I say, no deal has been finalised, so let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d After being relegated from the Football League in 2015, Tranmere have battled back and Micky Mellon\u2019s side are currently within three points of the play-off places in League Two. Mellon spoke to Andy Hunter about what a cup game against Spurs means to the club \u2026 Friday night is party night in Birkenhead and now it has got a football game to add to the spice. It\u2019s about the whole of the football club showing the whole football world that Tranmere is still here. We disappeared off the Football League radar for a while and when you have three years out of the league you can lose generations of fans. You can stop being a big football club. But we have seen in the last few years with trips to Wembley, occasions like this and the promotion battles that Tranmere is still here. It still has a fan base that, when called upon, can sell out in three hours. \u201cIt has unbelievable potential and it is up to us as a football business to make sure that we keep the momentum going forward. Friday night will help that.\u201d (All times GMT) Friday 7.45pm Tranmere v Tottenham Saturday 12.30pm Bournemouth v Brighton Burnley v Barnsley Manchester United v Reading Sheffield Wednesday v Luton Shrewsbury v Stoke City West Brom v Wigan West Ham v Birmingham 3pm Accrington v Ipswich Aston Villa v Swansea Bolton v Walsall Brentford v Oxford United Chelsea v Nottingham Forest Derby v Southampton Everton v Lincoln Fleetwood v Wimbledon Gillingham v Cardiff Middlesbrough v Peterborough 5.30pm Blackpool v Arsenal Bristol City v Huddersfield Crystal Palace v Grimsby Newcastle v Blackburn Rovers Norwich v Portsmouth Sunday 2pm Fulham v Oldham Athletic Manchester City v Rotherham Millwall v Hull City Preston v Doncaster Rovers QPR v Leeds United Sheffield United v Barnet Woking v Watford 4.30pm Newport v Leicester City Monday 7.45pm Wolves v Liverpool Manchester United\u2019s Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r caretakes his side at home to Reading in one of a depressing SEVEN 12.30pm GMT Cup kick-offs tomorrow. At this morning\u2019s press conference he appeared to indicate that his involvement in the transfer window will be, erm, well, y\u2019know \u2026 The club\u2019s probably had a plan - you don\u2019t just plan the next day and next month but this transfer window has probably been planned since the summer and year before. The structure [here] is phenomenal. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve got their targets,\u201d said the 45-year-old. \u201cI\u2019m here to voice my opinion on that and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll sit down, me and Ed [Woodward, executive vice-chairman] if we\u2019ve got anything in the pipeline. \u201cI\u2019m here to work with the ones I\u2019ve got, they\u2019ve all performed and as long as they perform they should get a chance but that\u2019s my job to improve players and individuals.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Romelu Lukaku will both start. Paul Pogba is a doubt with a knock sustained against Newcastle, while Marcus Rojo and Chris Smalling are both out of contention. Speaking of Spurs, they can be found at No 2 of today\u2019s 10 things to look out for this weekend \u2026 Spurs kick off the weekend\u2019s FA Cup third-round action tonight at Prenton Park. Micky Mellon\u2019s side may be heartened by Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s assessment of where the Cup sits in terms of silverware hierarchy in this day and age \u2026 To win the Carabao Cup and be in the middle of the Premier League table \u2026 I think I would be sacked a few years ago \u2013 with two or three Carabao Cups or FA Cups. If you don\u2019t finish how we have finished [in the league] in the last three seasons but win the FA Cup, I don\u2019t know if Daniel [Levy, the Spurs chairman] would have too much patience with me or is nice to say: \u2018OK, you\u2019re 10th in the Premier League, I\u2019ll give you a new contract.\u2019 Bit of early Spurs news today. This story from last week, on Toby Alderweireld\u2019s expected contract extension \u2026 \u2026 this is now an actual, official, tweeted-out-by-club thing \u2026 Daniel Taylor was on reporting duties last night \u2026 As the song goes, City fight to the end and it was not just their competitive courage to conjure up a decisive goal, courtesy of Leroy San\u00e9, that delivered a message. It was the spirit of togetherness displayed by Guardiola\u2019s players in that nerve-shredding finale when Liverpool started pumping balls into the penalty area. On one hand City have not kept a clean sheet during their past 11 fixtures. On the other it was a show of collective defiance during those fraught moments when Liverpool had Virgil van Dijk operating as an extra centre-forward. City gave everything to defend their lead, in the way that true champions do. They dug in, they formed an impenetrable blue line and, when it needed the ugly stuff, they were happy to oblige. In the process they made it clear to their opponents it is going to be one hell of a battle between now and the end of the season.\u201d Jamie Jackson ran the rule over both sets of players. Lowest scorer: Dejan Lovren \u201cWas near-awful throughout\u201d (2/10). San\u00e9 (\u201cscoring the finest goal of his City career) and Ag\u00fcero (\u201cWilling to dribble and take game to opponents\u201d) both attracted 9s \u2026 And so, to last night\u2019s freewheeling frenzy at the Etihad. An enthralling press-tastic game went City\u2019s way after Leroy San\u00e9 slotted superbly 18 minutes from time. But should Vincent Kompany have been early in with the rubber ducks after going in two-footed to curtail Mo Salah\u2019s charge towards Ederson\u2019s goal? J\u00fcrgen Klopp certainly thought so \u2026 I really like Vincent Kompany but how on earth is that not a red card? He is last man and he goes in. If he hits Mo [Salah] more, he is out for the season. It is not easy for the ref and he may not see it how I see it. \u201cHe took the risk, Mo is on his feet and, if he is not in the moment where he jumps over him, then we all talk differently. Still a nice guy but a really bad decision [from referee Anthony Taylor]. Do we need to open something [a limb]?\u201d As Barney Ronay said \u2026 The images of victory will be rooted elsewhere. Vincent Kompany was at times a cartoon of chest-heaving full-body defence, although he might also have been sent off for an excessively forceful lunge through Mohamed Salah. At the end, as City\u2019s players left the pitch, a teenage fan came haring through the lines to plead for a selfie with the captain and one half expected Kompany to take him out with a headlock- slamming two-footed Bruce Lee neck-lunge. Welcome to the first weekend countdown of 2019. A few hours\u2019 kip after a breathless top-of-the-Premier-League encounter, and suddenly The March Of The Second-Choice Keepers, aka the FA Cup third round, is upon us \u2013 starting at 7.45pm GMT tonight with Tranmere v Spurs. There\u2019s the small matter of a transfer window pootling along in the background too. Plenty of reaction and lead-up on the way. Email, tweet or leave a comment below and before you know it the weekend will be here. To start you off \u2013 here\u2019s today\u2019s Rumour Mill, heavy on the Chelsea, but with all-important Adam Lallana-to-Fenerbahce and Mario Balotelli-to-Newcastle contributions.",

      "bodyText": "A 102-year-old Devon man who was stuck on his roof for three days after trying to adjust his TV aerial later died of pneumonia, an inquest has heard. Ron Easton, known locally as Ton-Up Ron, died in hospital nine days after being rescued from his house in Bigbury-on-Sea on 24 October. The former racing driver fell face-down into a small, shallow gulley on his roof and lay there for three days unable to move. It is believed Easton had climbed up to adjust his TV aerial. Dr Sarah-Anne Milne, from Derriford hospital in Plymouth, told Plymouth coroner\u2019s court that Easton died of bronchopneumonia, with coronary heart disease listed as a contributing factor. The senior coroner Ian Arrow recorded Easton\u2019s death as accidental, saying the coroner\u2019s office had been struck by his \u201cadventurous spirit\u201d. The handyman who found Easton told a 999 call operator: \u201cHe\u2019s got a saw and a rake with him. I don\u2019t know what on earth he was doing. And he\u2019s up a ladder about eight or nine foot.\u201d When the paramedic asked the caller what time Easton fell, he replied: \u201cThere\u2019s three lots of milk here so it\u2019s probably three days ago, I would have thought. He\u2019s been up on that roof all that time.\u201d The caller was unable to get a response from Easton, but noticed he was still breathing. The handyman was first alerted to Easton\u2019s predicament after Trish Bagley, who delivered his milk and newspapers every day, noticed the bottles still on his doorstep. \u201cHe always takes his milk in every day so alarm bells rang,\u201d she told BBC News. The first paramedic on the scene, Nigel Toms, of the South Western ambulance service, said: \u201cHe was in a bit of a pickle; but I reached him fairly easily and got a response. His life was definitely at risk.\u201d Devon and Somerset fire and rescue were called to the scene and crews from Kingsbridge and Greenbank rescued Easton using ladders and a stretcher. He was airlifted to hospital and died nine days later.",

After repeated attempts to sell the house via conventional methods, including three price reductions, they were unable to secure a buyer. In desperation, they decided to try another, more risky, method. In August last year, their son, Matthew, suggested they try to raffle the four-bedroom property in the tiny North Yorkshire village of Grosmont. But Robert, 75, and Avril, 68, remain the reluctant owners of their home. Almost five months after launching the prize scheme with hopes to sell 60,000 of the \u00a310 tickets they were told to close down the competition. The couple had fallen foul of Gambling Commission rules and were told that it was not a legal prize competition as it had been deemed a potential lottery. Robert, a former lawyer, told the Guardian that the decision by the commission to pull the competition had been a \u201cbolt out of the blue\u201d and that he and his wife were still recovering from the shock. Smith claimed that he had contacted the commission in July to make it aware of the prize draw but he was informed of its decision only a few days before Christmas when thousands of tickets had already been bought. \u201cWhen Rachael died suddenly we decided we could no longer stay here,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThere were so many memories, we brought her here as a baby, they grew up here.

Raffle tickets are sold at a low cost and the sellers hope they can make up the sale price and pick one winner. The slowdown in the property market over the past year has led to an increase in the number of properties being offered as raffle prizes, in particular by homeowners who fail to achieve their desired asking price. For some, like Dunstan Low, who last year decided to raffle off his six-bedroom, grade II listed home, Melling Manor, the method was a success after he added a free entry option in the prize draw to avoid breaching gambling regulations. His \u201cwin a country home\u201d competition netted him \u00a31m in ticket sales for his property, the east wing of an 18th-century manor house in Lancashire.

The prospect of large numbers of English and Scottish officers being deployed on the streets of Northern Ireland after 29 March could anger republicans and complicate efforts to restore the power-sharing executive at Stormont, which collapsed in 2017. The option of reinforcements is deemed necessary to cover the possibility of civil disorder arising from disquiet about border arrangements that could be put in place after a hard Brexit. The police training will require officers to be pulled from their regular duties. It is needed because some of the equipment and tactics used in Northern Ireland vary from those used in the rest of the UK. The PSNI is yet to make the formal request under mutual aid arrangements, which are in place to enable local police forces to help each other in times of heightened demands. A team at the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council are planning for a no-deal Brexit which will also see extra demands on policing across the UK. Demands for reinforcements for Northern Ireland in the event of no deal come as forces with major ports in their jurisdiction prepare for chaos, especially at Dover in Kent. Plans for a national mobilisation of police, which were devised after the 2011 riots across England, are being revised and adapted for the tensions thrown up by a no-deal Brexit. The size of PSNI\u2019s request for reinforcements from the rest of the UK because of Brexit is roughly double those it has made in recent years for the province\u2019s marching season, when extra officers are needed to police tensions between Protestant and Catholic communities. In remarks rejecting the government\u2019s latest overtures to the DUP, the party\u2019s Nigel Dodds said fears of a hard border were \u201cnonsense propaganda\u201d, adding: \u201cWith this clarity emerging in London, Dublin and Brussels, there is evidently no need for this aspect of the withdrawal agreement.\u201d Sources suggested that the meetings with May and the Conservative chief whip, Julian Smith, were \u201cGroundhog Days\u201d for those present.

But Varadkar said the EU\u2019s existing offer would not change.

In 2014, after leaving the DfE, Cummings told the Times: \u201cEveryone thinks there\u2019s some moment, like in a James Bond movie, where you open the door and that\u2019s where the really good people are, but there is no door.\u201d</p> <p>In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/16/gove-cummings-david-cameron\">same interview</a>, he let loose on Cameron, describing the prime minister as \u201ca sphinx without a riddle\u201d, and Cameron\u2019s chief of staff, Ed Llewellyn, as a \u201cclassic third-rate, suck-up-kick-down sycophant\u201d. The remark prompted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/18/david-cameron-dominic-cummings-career-psychopath\">a thinly veiled retaliation</a> from the then prime minister, who told an audience a few days later that there seemed to be a path from special adviser to \u201ccareer psychopath\u201d.</p> <p>Cummings similarly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/15/former-gove-adviser-warns-leaks-gimmicks-dominic-cummings\">lashed out</a> at the Liberal Democrats, using his blog to accuse the Tories\u2019 coalition partners of \u201cstupid gimmicks\u201d. The then deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, responded by telling broadcasters that Cummings was \u201ca rather peculiar former Conservative adviser\u201d who had allowed his former role to go to his head.</p> <p>In 2015, Cummings and the political strategist Matthew Elliott founded Vote Leave, which was designated by the Electoral Commission as the official EU referendum <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/13/vote-leave-official-brexit-campaign-eu-referendum-boris-johnson\">leave campaign</a> in April of the following year.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-36872264/matthew-elliott-on-vote-leave-s-genius-moment\">Speaking to Newsnight</a> in July 2016, Elliott described the \u201cgenius moment\u201d that Cummings came up with the campaign\u2019s slogan. \u201cThe message has to be \u2018vote leave, take control\u2019,\u201d Cummings reportedly said. \u201cAnd that developed into \u2018vote leave, take back control\u2019,\u201d said Elliott. The message stuck. In a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d02b768-2e8b-11e6-a18d-a96ab29e3c95\">TV debate</a> in June 2016, Boris Johnson used the phrase \u201ctake control\u201d seven times in his one-minute opening statement.</p> <p>The former Labour MP Gisela Stuart, who became chairman of the Vote Leave campaign in March 2016, said despite differing from him in many areas of politics, she liked Cummings. \u201cI liked working with him because he makes up his mind about what he wants to do and then focuses quite strategically and relentlessly on what needs to be done in order to achieve it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Since the campaign\u2019s success, its tactics have been the subject of a series of high-profile scandals. Vote Leave\u2019s use of data analytics has been scrutinised after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/24/aggregateiq-data-firm-link-raises-leave-group-questions\">Observer reported</a> that the controversial data-mining company Cambridge Analytica had links to the Canadian digital firm AggregateIQ, on which Vote Leave spent 40% of its campaign budget.</p> <p>In July 2018, the Electoral Commission announced Vote Leave had been found guilty of breaking electoral law by overspending, following testimony from whistleblowers. The group was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/17/vote-leave-fined-and-reported-to-police-by-electoral-commission-brexit\">fined \u00a361,000</a> and referred to the police.</p> <p>Cummings has used his blog to furiously defend himself and the Vote Leave campaign in the face of the allegations. \u201cHardcore remainers are similar,\u201d he <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/2018/07/27/on-referendum-24l-fake-news-from-the-fake-news-committee-carole-and-a-rematch-against-the-public/\">wrote in July</a> last year. \u201cThey want a second referendum and this requires delegitimising the first. They therefore hysterically spread false memes while shouting \u2018liars\u2019 at leavers.\u201d</p> <p>While Cummings has not given any media interviews since the referendum, he told the Guardian he had not seen the film and had nothing to say about it. But his family seem content with Cumberbatch\u2019s performance. Writing in the Spectator last month, his wife, Mary Wakefield, <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/12/benedict-cumberbatch-on-playing-my-husband-dominic-cummings/\">detailed an evening</a> in the summer of 2018 when Cumberbatch came round for a dinner of \u201cvegan pie\u201d.</p> <p>She spoke of the relief that he had not come to judge her husband but \u201cto become him\u201d. \u201cHe looks so like him in the trailer,\u201d she said. \u201cHis mannerisms are so perfect that it\u2019s hard not to imagine he\u2019s having Dom-ish thoughts.\u201d</p>",

They therefore hysterically spread false memes while shouting \u2018liars\u2019 at leavers.\u201d While Cummings has not given any media interviews since the referendum, he told the Guardian he had not seen the film and had nothing to say about it. But his family seem content with Cumberbatch\u2019s performance. Writing in the Spectator last month, his wife, Mary Wakefield, detailed an evening in the summer of 2018 when Cumberbatch came round for a dinner of \u201cvegan pie\u201d. She spoke of the relief that he had not come to judge her husband but \u201cto become him\u201d. \u201cHe looks so like him in the trailer,\u201d she said. \u201cHis mannerisms are so perfect that it\u2019s hard not to imagine he\u2019s having Dom-ish thoughts.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s the same every New Year\u2019s Eve. That momentary surge of disappointment that I\u2019ve yet again been overlooked in the honours list. Not even a measly MBE to mark the futility of my existence. Given how little some others who have been recognised with a bauble have achieved, it doesn\u2019t seem too much to ask. Take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/30/knight-of-shame-honour-for-john-redwood-takes-the-biscuit\">John Redwood</a>, who has just been knighted. Nobody quite seems to know why. Not even Redwood. He was the Welsh secretary for a couple of years between 1993 and 1995, and a knighthood to mark the 25th anniversary of him miming badly to the Welsh national anthem seems a little far-fetched.</p> <p>Some believed his elevation to Sir John was a bribe to get the outspoken Eurosceptic to vote for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, but Redwood has subsequently insisted he hasn\u2019t been bought and will vote against the deal regardless. Which leaves only one possible reason for Redwood\u2019s preferment: that he has been the backbench Conservative MP for Wokingham, one of the safest of safe seats, for more than 30 years. In other words, he has become a knight simply because he has managed both to stay alive and avoid being implicated in any sex or financial scandals. It\u2019s not the highest of bars for an honour that is meant to recognise an important contribution to public life. It also paves the way for Sir Chris Grayling and Sir Gavin Williamson at a later date. Imagine that.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>I have a problem with going to the movies. Every time I go, no matter how good or how bad the film, I invariably fall asleep. There\u2019s something about a comfortable seat and the lights going down that catches me out every time. It happened again today when we went to see Olivia Colman in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/30/the-favourite-review-olivia-colman-yorgos-lanthimos\">The Favourite</a>. I haven\u2019t drunk alcohol for nearly 32 years so I can\u2019t have been hungover from staying up to watch the fireworks on the TV the night before \u2013 I really live the dream \u2013 but after about 10 minutes I was getting nudged in the ribs by my wife and ticked off for snoring.</p> <p>I must have managed to get the snoring under control because \u2013 after a short, losing battle to stay awake \u2013 I was left undisturbed as I dozed off again for my regulation half-hour. Having eventually regained consciousness, I was then left to try to work out who was who and what was going on, which always makes any movie rather more challenging than the director intended. Just as I reckoned I was about on top of the situation, I nodded off again and missed the ending. But I am assured by the three people I went with that it is a film well worth seeing, and certainly the bits I did see were great.</p> <p>On the plus side, I did manage to stay awake throughout the whole of Sarah Phelps\u2019 wonderful adaptation of Agatha Christie\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/26/abc-murders-review-john-malkovich-poirot-magnificent\">ABC Murders </a>on TV in the evening. Though I was disturbed to find I appeared to be in a minority of one for liking both John Malkovich\u2019s and David Suchet\u2019s portrayals of Poirot. According to Twitter, you were only allowed to like one or the other.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>The prime minister may have been regretting her decision to give parliament two weeks off for Christmas at a time of constitutional and political crisis. If only because it\u2019s given so many members of her cabinet the chance to prove not just how hopeless they really are but also how anxious they are to replace her.</p> <p>Sajid Javid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/29/sajid-javid-cuts-holiday-short-to-tackle-channel-migrant-crossings\">cut short his South African safari</a> to personally deal with the \u201cnational emergency\u201d of a few dozen refugees getting washed up on Kent beaches by talking tough on immigration to any passing TV camera. Long after his leadership bid has bitten the dust, Sajid will be getting grief from his family for ruining their holiday. Good.</p> <p>Not to be outdone, Gavin Williamson, the fireplace salesman also known as the defence secretary, used the break to announce he would establish new military outposts in the far east. Because the empire worked out so well last time. He then hastily diverted some warships to the Channel to crack down on rubber dinghies and was last heard of planning a pointless raid on Dieppe. </p> <p>For the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, we had Chris Grayling \u2013 who else? \u2013 awarding a ferry company that had no boats and seemed to specialise in pizza deliveries a \u00a313m contract on the grounds that it was British. The stupidity bar has never been lower. Make no mistake, Javid, Williamson and Grayling will all be in the Lords soon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2ce1ec7772636708ac27895890eb74cee78a6f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2ce1ec7772636708ac27895890eb74cee78a6f8/0_266_4063_2438/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018You just can\u2019t do anything about the tumbleweed these days.'\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Road sweeper outside No 10: \u2018You just can\u2019t do anything about the tumbleweed these days.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>With parliament in recess, I was able to sneak off to a preview screening of James Graham\u2019s excellent Channel 4 drama, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/04/brexit-uncivil-war-tv-of-week\">Brexit: The Uncivil War</a>. So much about the film was well-researched and spot-on (the look of horror on Boris Johnson\u2019s face when the referendum result is declared was pitch perfect), but it is Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s performance as the Vote Leave architect Dominic Cummings that really took centre stage.</p> <p>For most of the campaign, Cummings operated in the shadows, using Johnson and Michael Gove as figureheads for his \u00a3350m bus stunts, and he only showed his head above the parapet when he was summoned to explain his actions before the Treasury select committee. I was privileged to have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/20/accuracy-is-for-snake-oil-pussies-vote-leaves-campaign-director-defies-mps\">ringside seat</a>. He began by picking a fight with the chair, Andrew Tyrie. Instead of taking his seat, Cummings strode across the room to eyeball Tyrie face to face, insisting that he had to be away by 4pm and that if proceedings overran then he would walk out. Thereafter, he appeared hellbent on proving descriptions of him as a political psychopath to be entirely accurate. It was the most memorable committee appearance since the ex-Mrs Murdoch assaulted a member for the public for throwing flour over Rupert. He refused to confirm anything, saying it was not up to Vote Leave to provide accurate information, and made a point of insulting each member of the committee in turn.</p> <p>It was hard to know if he was an idiot savant or an idiot complete and by the end it was impossible to tell if Cummings actually believed in the objectives of the Vote Leave campaign or was merely fuelled by contempt and disdain for the political establishment. Two years and James Graham\u2019s film later, I\u2019m still none the wiser.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>I can sense the beginnings of an old obsession being rekindled. As a 12-year-old boy I read everything I could get my hands on about Nasa\u2019s Apollo programme and kept a detailed scrapbook of every lunar mission. I even persuaded my parents to allow me to stay up half the night watching Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin become the first men to walk on the moon. The ambition, the adventure, the solitude and the sense of otherness \u2013 I\u2019d never even been on an aeroplane \u2013 totally captivated me and I felt a huge sense of loss when the US pulled the plug on Apollo in 1972.</p> <p>The Americans might have got a bit bored with seeing people landing on the moon and decided the money could be better spent elsewhere, but I was still up for plenty more. By the time exploration restarted with the shuttle and the International Space Station, I had rather lost interest and only followed the missions half-heartedly. I didn\u2019t understand the science, and orbiting the Earth for months on end seemed rather too familiar. So much so that even Richard Branson felt like he could have a go.</p> <p>But this week has felt like a game-changer. First we\u2019ve had Nasa\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/31/new-horizons-heads-for-flyby-of-space-rock-ultima-thule\">New Horizons spacecraft</a> taking photos of the snowman-shaped Ultima Thule 4bn miles away, and then the Chinese <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/04/china-change-4-moon-rover-jade-rabbit-2-sets-off\">Chang\u2019e 4</a> making the first landing on the far side of the moon. At a time when so much of the news is depressing and nationalistic, both missions feel like landmark steps into the unknown. My fingers are already twitching over a new scrapbook.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba1c0879d72361db42adf7d18bce0caeb93a0e1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba1c0879d72361db42adf7d18bce0caeb93a0e1d/0_0_2835_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brexit: The Uncivil War\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Actor playing Boris Johnson in Brexit: The Uncivil War: \u2018Am I lying?\u2019 TV\u2019s Matthew Elliot: \u2018Your lips are moving.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Wall/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Digested week, digested</strong>: the roll-on, roll-off pizza delivery service.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Monday It\u2019s the same every New Year\u2019s Eve. That momentary surge of disappointment that I\u2019ve yet again been overlooked in the honours list. Not even a measly MBE to mark the futility of my existence. Given how little some others who have been recognised with a bauble have achieved, it doesn\u2019t seem too much to ask. Take John Redwood, who has just been knighted. Nobody quite seems to know why. Not even Redwood. He was the Welsh secretary for a couple of years between 1993 and 1995, and a knighthood to mark the 25th anniversary of him miming badly to the Welsh national anthem seems a little far-fetched. Some believed his elevation to Sir John was a bribe to get the outspoken Eurosceptic to vote for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, but Redwood has subsequently insisted he hasn\u2019t been bought and will vote against the deal regardless. Which leaves only one possible reason for Redwood\u2019s preferment: that he has been the backbench Conservative MP for Wokingham, one of the safest of safe seats, for more than 30 years. In other words, he has become a knight simply because he has managed both to stay alive and avoid being implicated in any sex or financial scandals. It\u2019s not the highest of bars for an honour that is meant to recognise an important contribution to public life. It also paves the way for Sir Chris Grayling and Sir Gavin Williamson at a later date. Imagine that. Tuesday I have a problem with going to the movies. Every time I go, no matter how good or how bad the film, I invariably fall asleep. There\u2019s something about a comfortable seat and the lights going down that catches me out every time. It happened again today when we went to see Olivia Colman in The Favourite. I haven\u2019t drunk alcohol for nearly 32 years so I can\u2019t have been hungover from staying up to watch the fireworks on the TV the night before \u2013 I really live the dream \u2013 but after about 10 minutes I was getting nudged in the ribs by my wife and ticked off for snoring. I must have managed to get the snoring under control because \u2013 after a short, losing battle to stay awake \u2013 I was left undisturbed as I dozed off again for my regulation half-hour. Having eventually regained consciousness, I was then left to try to work out who was who and what was going on, which always makes any movie rather more challenging than the director intended. Just as I reckoned I was about on top of the situation, I nodded off again and missed the ending. But I am assured by the three people I went with that it is a film well worth seeing, and certainly the bits I did see were great. On the plus side, I did manage to stay awake throughout the whole of Sarah Phelps\u2019 wonderful adaptation of Agatha Christie\u2019s ABC Murders on TV in the evening. Though I was disturbed to find I appeared to be in a minority of one for liking both John Malkovich\u2019s and David Suchet\u2019s portrayals of Poirot. According to Twitter, you were only allowed to like one or the other. Wednesday The prime minister may have been regretting her decision to give parliament two weeks off for Christmas at a time of constitutional and political crisis. If only because it\u2019s given so many members of her cabinet the chance to prove not just how hopeless they really are but also how anxious they are to replace her. Sajid Javid cut short his South African safari to personally deal with the \u201cnational emergency\u201d of a few dozen refugees getting washed up on Kent beaches by talking tough on immigration to any passing TV camera. Long after his leadership bid has bitten the dust, Sajid will be getting grief from his family for ruining their holiday. Good. Not to be outdone, Gavin Williamson, the fireplace salesman also known as the defence secretary, used the break to announce he would establish new military outposts in the far east. Because the empire worked out so well last time. He then hastily diverted some warships to the Channel to crack down on rubber dinghies and was last heard of planning a pointless raid on Dieppe. For the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, we had Chris Grayling \u2013 who else? \u2013 awarding a ferry company that had no boats and seemed to specialise in pizza deliveries a \u00a313m contract on the grounds that it was British. The stupidity bar has never been lower. Make no mistake, Javid, Williamson and Grayling will all be in the Lords soon. Thursday With parliament in recess, I was able to sneak off to a preview screening of James Graham\u2019s excellent Channel 4 drama, Brexit: The Uncivil War. So much about the film was well-researched and spot-on (the look of horror on Boris Johnson\u2019s face when the referendum result is declared was pitch perfect), but it is Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s performance as the Vote Leave architect Dominic Cummings that really took centre stage. For most of the campaign, Cummings operated in the shadows, using Johnson and Michael Gove as figureheads for his \u00a3350m bus stunts, and he only showed his head above the parapet when he was summoned to explain his actions before the Treasury select committee. I was privileged to have a ringside seat. He began by picking a fight with the chair, Andrew Tyrie. Instead of taking his seat, Cummings strode across the room to eyeball Tyrie face to face, insisting that he had to be away by 4pm and that if proceedings overran then he would walk out. Thereafter, he appeared hellbent on proving descriptions of him as a political psychopath to be entirely accurate. It was the most memorable committee appearance since the ex-Mrs Murdoch assaulted a member for the public for throwing flour over Rupert. He refused to confirm anything, saying it was not up to Vote Leave to provide accurate information, and made a point of insulting each member of the committee in turn. It was hard to know if he was an idiot savant or an idiot complete and by the end it was impossible to tell if Cummings actually believed in the objectives of the Vote Leave campaign or was merely fuelled by contempt and disdain for the political establishment. Two years and James Graham\u2019s film later, I\u2019m still none the wiser. Friday I can sense the beginnings of an old obsession being rekindled. As a 12-year-old boy I read everything I could get my hands on about Nasa\u2019s Apollo programme and kept a detailed scrapbook of every lunar mission. I even persuaded my parents to allow me to stay up half the night watching Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin become the first men to walk on the moon. The ambition, the adventure, the solitude and the sense of otherness \u2013 I\u2019d never even been on an aeroplane \u2013 totally captivated me and I felt a huge sense of loss when the US pulled the plug on Apollo in 1972. The Americans might have got a bit bored with seeing people landing on the moon and decided the money could be better spent elsewhere, but I was still up for plenty more. By the time exploration restarted with the shuttle and the International Space Station, I had rather lost interest and only followed the missions half-heartedly. I didn\u2019t understand the science, and orbiting the Earth for months on end seemed rather too familiar. So much so that even Richard Branson felt like he could have a go. But this week has felt like a game-changer. First we\u2019ve had Nasa\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft taking photos of the snowman-shaped Ultima Thule 4bn miles away, and then the Chinese Chang\u2019e 4 making the first landing on the far side of the moon. At a time when so much of the news is depressing and nationalistic, both missions feel like landmark steps into the unknown. My fingers are already twitching over a new scrapbook. Digested week, digested: the roll-on, roll-off pizza delivery service.",

      "bodyText": "Nobody was expecting that. After a shortened week of trading marked by volatility and large sell-offs in household name stocks, led by Apple, US jobs data has given investors a reason to buy across the world. The FTSE 100 is up by more than 2% in afternoon trading, among a host of strong performances on European bourses. The German Dax was up by 2.7%. ADP payrolls data yesterday had suggested that the closely followed non-farm payrolls number might be higher than the 177,000 average expected by economists. But at 312,000 new jobs added in December, the tally came in far above the most bullish expectations \u2013 while wage growth also accelerated. The data will provide some comfort to Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, who is speaking at a panel event in Atlanta, Georgia. Markets have been roiled in recent months by fears that the Fed is intent on a course of monetary tightening even as growth slows \u2013 and indeed some recent data have seemed to suggest that a slowdown is on its way. Yet the jobs numbers seem to point to a different picture, and have given Wall Street a buying signal. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq are both on course for 2% gains, while the S%P 500 is up by 1.8%. The more positive tone had been set earlier in the day by news that the US and China have scheduled talks beginning on Monday to try to make progress on resolving their long-running trade dispute. In the UK, meanwhile, today\u2019s services purchasing managers index (PMI) pointed to a continuation of the \u201cBrexit anxiety\u201d which has held back the economy. Data compiler IHS Markit said the tepid expansion suggested that overall growth in the UK economy will come in at 0.1% for the fourth quarter, a significant slowdown. Thanks for reading this week \u2013 normal service resumes with Graeme Wearden at the helm on Monday. JJ Trump\u2019s main economics adviser, Larry Kudlow, is on television talking up the economy. \u201cThere is no recession in sight,\u201d says Kudlow, the director of the president\u2019s National Economic Council. The strong jobs data have dampened demand for safe-haven assets: spot gold prices are now down by more than 1% at $1,280.2 per ounce. The US dollar is now up by around 0.4% against the euro. Trump has noticed the jobs numbers. Although perhaps he will like them if Jerome Powell signals that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise rates this year in his comments in just over half an hour. Too good to be true? That\u2019s the question on the massive non-farm payrolls number asked by James Knightley, an economist at ING. This really positive report should certainly ease creeping fears in the market that the Federal Reserve may be forced to cut interest rates. However, given the growing headwinds facing the US there will be doubts over whether such strength is sustainable. That list of headwinds is long and potentially potent: \u201cfading support from the fiscal stimulus, a strong US dollar, lagged effects of higher interest rates and weaker external demand amidst worries over trade protectionism\u201d \u2013 not to mention the wildcard that is US President Donald Trump. Certainly the US economy does face more headwinds this year, but this in our view is likely to mean a slower and more modest set of rate hikes versus 2018 rather than actual policy easing. Given the recent financial market turbulence and uncertainty caused by the ongoing government shutdown we suspect there will be a pause in 1Q19, but in an environment of respectable economic growth and rising wage and core inflation pressures we still look for tighter monetary policy over the summer. The Nasdaq has led gains on US indices at Wall Street\u2019s opening bell, jumping by 1.6%. The S&amp;P500 gained 1.4% at the open, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose by more than 300 points, or 1.5%. It comes after the US economy added more than 312,000 jobs in December, far above economists\u2019 expectations. The US has now added jobs for 99 consecutive months \u2013 the longest streak of job creation since records began. Over 2018 employers added an average of 220,000 jobs a month, the best growth since 2015, writes Dominic Rushe. The 3.2% wage gain from a year earlier was the largest since 2008, as the financial crisis began to take hold of the US economy. Read more detail here: \u201cStrong gains make mockery of recession fears\u201d \u2013 economists react to non-farm payrolls. The jobs numbers suggest the US economy still has \u201cconsiderable forward momentum\u201d, said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. Jobs were added across sectors, while the rise in unemployment can be explained by the big rise in the labour market participation rate, which increased. The data may suggest the Federal Reserve should keep on raising rates, despite market bets that they won\u2019t for at least another year, said Ashworth: Overall, the markets may have decided the Fed\u2019s work is done, but the economic data say otherwise. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, said Powell will be grinning ahead of his appearance later today. Stock market futures still indicate a big gain at the opening bell for US markets. Dow Jones industrial average futures up by 1.2%, S&amp;P 500 futures have gained 1.3% for the day, and Nasdaq futures are still up by 1.4%. US wage growth also rose, at an annual rate of 3.2%, above expectations of 3% even as unemployment increased. US Treasury yields rose in the aftermath of the non-farm payrolls data, as investors sold off 10-year benchmark government bonds. The yield, which moves inversely to price, on the US 10-year rose by four basis points to above 2.64%, before paring slightly. The stronger-than-expected jobs data could reassure some investors that the US economy is not performing as badly as a recent market sell-off would suggest. Unemployment in the US economy rose at the same time to 3.9%, as more people were drawn into the labour market. Non-farm payrolls data show the US economy added 312,000 jobs in December \u2013 far higher than the 177,000 expected by economists. At the top of the agenda for investors (although not necessarily for Powell) will be the recent market sell-off \u2013 spurred in part by fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy too much, making a dreaded policy mistake. Financial markets anticipate zero chance of a rate hike during 2019 following the stock market moves, with thoughts turning to a possible loosening of policy if the economy shows further signs of a downturn. Dean Popplewell, a vice president at spreadbetter Oanda, asks: With the market pricing out any Fed hikes for this year, will a strong non-farm payrolls print see dealers reversing their decision that the Fed is ready to abandon its rate hike plans when employment growth is still so strong? The US jobs data, the non-farm payrolls, can be a major market-moving event because of its implications on the Federal Reserve\u2019s thinking. Traders are getting a double helping today, with Fed chair Jerome Powell due to speak on a panel with his predecessors, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, at the American Economic Association in Georgia. But first, at 1:30pm GMT, non-farms from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists\u2019 consensus expectations point to 177,000 new jobs added in December, up from 155,000 in November. However, separate data from private-sector payroll provider ADP yesterday came in much higher than expected, prompting questions on whether an upside surprise is coming. Less than half an hour to go until US jobs data, and American stock futures show markets remain on track for gains today. Gains of 1.3% and 1.2% respectively for futures in the S&amp;P500 and the Dow Jones industrial average, while Nasdaq futures have gained 1.4%. The US dollar is slightly lower, with a trade-weighted basket down by 0.1% today, reflecting a small fall against the euro today. Parliament may not be back until next week, but if you can\u2019t wait for your political fix then John Goldie, a foreign exchange dealer at Argentex, has been gaming the scenarios. He reckons if Prime Minister Theresa May gets the deal agreed with the EU27 through parliament it could boost sterling by as much as 7%. However, on the basis that not much has changed since May was forced to pull a vote on the deal last month, if a vote is held and lost in the coming weeks it could do serious damage to sterling, which is currently trading up today at about $1.2677 against the US dollar and \u20ac1.1104 against the euro. The next step would be to request extension to Article 50, says Goldie: Most likely this would be accepted by the EU27 (they would be more than happy for the possibility of No Brexit At All), and we move towards new votes: an election or referendum. GBPEUR would likely remain range bound for the foreseeable future, though perhaps a return to 1.13-1.15 range. GBPUSD would go back to 1.30 if we\u2019re lucky, but any further move higher would be very much dollar-dependent. However, it has to be unanimous. If an extension were rejected, this is the route to a full, clean, No Deal exit \u2013 by default \u2013 through failing to agree and ratify terms within the Article 50 timeframe. This situation would bring about our current predictions of 1.19 and 1.00 against the dollar and the euro respectively.\u201d Eurozone inflation data from this morning is certainly giving economists something to think about, as lower oil prices threaten to derail the European Central Bank\u2019s gradual tightening of monetary policy. Price growth moderated to an annual rate of 1.6% in December, the lowest in eight months, according to the European Commission\u2019s statistics office. A sharp drop in energy inflation was the big driver in the fall, from 1.9% in November. Mario Draghi, the ECB\u2019s president, staked the move to end stimulative asset purchases on rising inflation in the Eurozone. The data show that higher wages still have not translated into core inflation, said Bert Colijn, an economist at ING. If the economic situation continues to worsen, it could be that higher wages don\u2019t translate into significantly higher core inflation for the months ahead, although some upward movement can be expected. Depending on how long oil prices remain in the 50 dollar range, headline inflation could even fall to around 1%. This leaves the ECB in an awkward spot with regards to their first rate hike. The decline in oil prices is a good thing for economic growth, because fuel is cheaper for businesses, but it can also prove politically difficult for central banks such as the ECB which are mandated to target 2% annual inflation. Hiking interest rates when inflation is below target is not a great look. We\u2019re coming up to midday on Friday 4 January. For the average FTSE 100 chief executive that means they have almost earned the same amount during 2019 as the average British worker will throughout the whole year. Calculations by the High Pay Centre thinktank and the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) show top executives are earning 133 times more than the average worker, at a rate of around \u00a31,020 per hour or \u00a33.9m annually, writes Kalyeena Makortoff. That means chief executives made do with an earnings increase of 11% compared to a year earlier, while the average Briton\u2019s wages rose by a rather more measly 3.3%, according to the Office for National Statistics. Stock markets across the EU have rebounded from yesterday\u2019s losses as a more positive mood takes hold thanks in part to the announcement trade talks between China and the US. The new talks between Beijing and Washington will take place next week at the vice ministerial level, raising hopes that the trade war started by President Donald Trump will be eased. The People\u2019s Bank of China has also eased the reserve requirement ratio for banks, indicating its willingness to stimulate the economy if there is a slowdown. The positive sentiment, after a shortened trading week in which stocks have suffered, has lifted the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index by 1.35%. Germany\u2019s benchmark Dax index has gained 1.55%, while the French Cac 40 has risen by 1.15%. London\u2019s FTSE 100 is up by 1.26%. Gaurav Saroliya, head of global macro strategy at Oxford Economics, argues that the recent market downturns have been driven more by sentiment than fundamentals, although \u201cbulls are lacking propulsion\u201d. He added: The sell-off in equities and other risk assets, fueled by multiple worries such as growth slowdown, higher rates, lack of supportive policy catalysts and geopolitical headwinds, smacks of an overreaction. It\u2019s looking like a more positive day on Wall Street. Futures are pointing to a rebound after yesterday\u2019s Apple-inspired pain. S&amp;P 500 futures are up by 1.3%, Dow Jones industrial average futures are up by 1.2%, and Nasdaq futures have gained 1.7%, with a few hours to go yet until markets open in New York. The sell-off yesterday was steep, but there were also reminders that the US economy is still growing and there is still activity. For instance, pharma company Bristol-Myers Squibb pulled off a truly giant deal for biotech rival Celgene \u2013 $74bn in cash and stock, topping $90bn when debt is included. British consumer credit growth has also slowed, according to more bellwether data for the UK economy published today. Consumer credit, which includes credit cards and personal loans, grew by 7.1% year-on-year for November, the weakest since March 2015, according to Bank of England figures. The growth of borrowing from households has been slowing in recent months, in part because double-digit annual growth in debt was unsustainable at a time when broader economic growth was weak. However, unwillingness for consumers to take on more debt when uncertainties abound has also been highlighted by economists. Mortgage approvals also fell to a seven-month low, the Bank said, adding to the picture of a gloomy housing market. City economists are split over whether to trust the measly picture of the British economy given by the services data. The survey is \u201coverstating the extent of the easing\u201d in the British economy at the end of the fourth quarter, says Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics \u2013 and a 0.1% fourth-quarter growth prediction from IHS Markit is too pessimistic. Dales said: We\u2019d place more weight on the slightly more upbeat CBI [Confederation of British Industry] growth indicator and think that 0.3% quarter-on-quarter is more likely. If a Brexit deal is agreed soon, growth will surely rise this year. However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says the weak new orders balance and pessimistic outlook from businesses point to further tepid growth. He said: The continued weakness of the business activity index in December adds to evidence that the economy effectively has ground to a halt, primarily due to mounting concerns about Brexit. The British economy is expected to expand by 0.1% in the final quarter says IHS Markit. The data firm\u2019s forecasts, based on the PMI data from services, manufacturing and construction, are lower than the average of the Treasury\u2019s collection of economists\u2019 forecasts, which point to 0.3% growth in the final quarter of the year. A quick glance at this graph from IHS Markit/CIPS shows that the sector is not expanding at the pace seen in most months since the global financial crisis. Employment growth has also weakened as firms hold back. The statement from IHS Markit/CIPS said: New work increased only marginally during December, which contributed to a slowdown in job creation to its weakest since July 2016. Sterling and the FTSE 100 are stable after the services PMI release \u2013 which was broadly in line with expectations. The pound is still up by 0.3% against the US dollar, while the FTSE 100 gains have extended to 1.1%. The mid-cap stocks on the FTSE 250 are up by 1.2%. However, IHS Markit describe it as a \u201csubdued end to 2018\u201d, as business activity rose at one of the slowest rates since the Brexit vote. November\u2019s data had been a 20-month low, so while the pick-up was greater than expected, the survey points to uncertainty holding back activity. The services sector is \u201cshowing worrying signs of having lost steam amid intensifying Brexit anxiety\u201d, according to Chris Williamson, the IHS Markit economist. He said: The final two months of 2018 saw the weakest back-to-back expansions of business activity since late-2012 and highlight how clarity on Brexit is needed urgently in order to prevent the economy sliding into contraction. The British services sector accelerated slightly in December, bucking expectations of a slowdown. The closely followed purchasing managers index rose to 51.2, up from 50.4 in November, according to data firm IHS Markit. Economists had expected a reading of 50.7, according to a poll ahead of the data. Sterling has edged up by about 0.3% ahead of the services PMI data. Elsewhere on currency markets the euro is up by 0.2% against the dollar, for the most part seemingly unaffected by the marginally weaker than expected performance in its services sector. The Japanese yen has also weakened against the dollar and the euro. On the FTSE 100 the mining contingent (which is particularly sensitive to global demand) are all performing well, with Antofagasta, Anglo American, Glencore and BHP all up by around 3% or more. At the risk of services PMI overload, it\u2019s worth taking a look at one of the main drivers of the slightly more hopeful feel on markets this morning from earlier in the day. Chinese markets, which enjoyed strong recoveries today, were boosted by the Caixin services PMI, which showed expansion in the sector accelerating in December. The reading rose to a five-month high of 52.2 in December, up from 51.9 the month before. It comes after the equivalent data for the manufacturing sector prompted a sell-off, which was only exacerbated by Apple\u2019s shock forecast cut. Chinese authorities have also lowered reserve requirements for banks, theoretically allowing them to lend more in a bid to pump up growth. Mike van Dulken and Artjom Hatsaturjants, analysts at Accendo Markets, said: After an ugly start to 2019 for equities, growth concerns abound. The China services update (and stimulus pledge) helps cushion manufacturing contraction this week, and confirms Monday\u2019s official data suggesting services are in ruder health. French services activity fell for the first time since June 2016, which IHS Markit said reflects disruption from the \u201cgilet jaunes\u201d, the protesters on living costs named after their yellow vests. Services firms reported the weakest new business volumes for four years in December. Chris Williamson, IHS Markit\u2019s chief business economist, said: The eurozone economy moved down another gear at the end of 2018, with growth down considerably from the elevated rates at thestart of the year. Neither are businesses expecting any rebound in demand, he added, pointing to a not insignificant list of headwinds: \u201ctrade wars, Brexit, heightened political uncertainty, financial market volatility and slower global economic growth.\u201d The Eurozone composite purchasing managers index (PMI) has fallen to the lowest since July 2013. The indicator of Eurozone economic activity fell to 51.1 in December, still above the 50 no-change mark but well below the previous reading of 52.7, IHS Markit reported. The reading was dragged back by the services sector, where reading came in at 51.2 in December, the lowest level in over four years. All looking very green on European markets. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is the leader, up by 1.3%, while the FTSE 100 in London has given up some of the opening gain for a 0.6% rise \u2013 although it is likely be a holding pattern until 9:30am, when the UK services PMI data comes in. The owner of the Slug and Lettuce chain of bars has reported its Christmas trading, and it\u2019s mostly positive news. Sales at Stonegate rose by 12% on the year in the two weeks to 1 January, the private company reported today. Investors have been on the lookout for any signs that retail and other consumer discretionary companies struggled over Christmas, after entertainment retailer HMV collapsed into administration before the new year. However, those few firms which have reported so far appear to have performed relatively well despite bad weather and weak spending patterns \u2013 see Next\u2019s update from yesterday. \u201cWe have entered 2019 with positive momentum,\u201d said Simon Longbottom, Stonegate\u2019s chief executive. Nationwide\u2019s house price barometer shows a marked slowdown in the market for homes, with annual growth across the UK of just 0.5%, the slowest since February 2013. The slowdown was broadly expected, but is still notable, said Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide. UK house price growth slowed noticeably as 2018 drew to a close, with prices just 0.5% higher than December 2017. This marks a noticeable slowdown from previous months. Prices fell by 0.7% in December compared to a 0.4% decrease in November. The average British house price is now \u00a3212,281. The slowdown was prompted by the \u201cimpact of the uncertain economic outlook on buyer sentiment\u201d, he added \u2013 a not very subtle reference to Brexit. It has all the signs of a bounce on the FTSE 100 risers, with oil-exposed companies among the early performers. Oil services firm John Wood Group is up by 3.3%, while packaging firm Mondi gained 2.4% in early trading. FTSE 100 opens up by 1%. France\u2019s Cac 40 up 0.8% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rises by 0.86%. Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index gains 0.8%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. In the UK all eyes today are on the services sector, with the closely watched services purchasing managers index (PMI) up at 9:30am to give the first reading on how the majority of the economy performed at the end of 2018. The problems facing the British economy are well known by now: Brexit uncertainty, weaker consumer spending, and long-term productivity struggles. With only two more readings to go before the UK leaves the EU on 29 March, economists will be keen to see how businesses are coping with the strain. Beyond the UK, Apple lost almost a tenth of its value in a single trading session, as investors finally had the chance to catch up to its downgrade on Wednesday night. The selling pushed Apple\u2019s market capitalisation \u2013 only a few months ago more than $1 trillion \u2013 below Google owner Alphabet. And US stocks, not helped by weak manufacturing data, were dragged down in its wake: the S&amp;P 500 lost 2.5%, the Dow Jones industrial average fell by 2.8%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 3%. It was an \u201caggressive sell-off\u201d in the US and beyond because of the broader implications of slower growth, particularly in China, said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda. This naturally feeds into investors deep-rooted fears about the global economy this year and so the impact of the warning stretched well beyond Apple and its suppliers and even, it would seem, into the FX market where the yen was heavily bid. What a day then, for Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, to make his first public comments of 2019 \u2013 a year when markets are forecasting no rate hikes from the US central bank. Powell will join his predecessors, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, on a panel discussion after non-farm payrolls data gives a snapshot of the US labour market. Fritz Louw, a currency analyst at MUFG, said: We fully expect the overall tone of [Powell\u2019s] comments to indicate a willingness to change course given the emerging evidence of a slowdown in economic activity. Chairman Powell will be fully aware that the tightening of financial market conditions in November-December has played a role in hitting sentiment and hence the Fed can be very influential in changing those conditions. Still, a big sigh of relief can be heard from China this morning as the waves from Apple\u2019s revenue forecast downgrade calm \u2013 although Japanese stocks still sold off after coming back from a holiday. Chinese stock markets have bounced back from steep losses to gains of 2.1% on the Shanghai stock exchange and 2.4% on the CSI 300 index which includes Shenzhen.

Awkwardly jerking her arms up and down at a UN campus in Nairobi, with kids in Cape Town, and at a carefully media trained and scripted speech at the Tory party conference in October.

ITF, registered in 1995 in the British Virgin Islands, was formed by cattle farmers with the help of Dudley\u2019s expertise as a \u201cshipping consultant\u201d, according to Companies House. Its plan was to export live calves to the continent to be slaughtered for veal.</p> <p>The trade was the subject of protests from animal rights campaigners, forcing local police to draft in more than 1,000 extra officers to enable the exports, which were legal, to continue. One protester was killed during clashes with police.</p> <p>So fraught was that period that Dudley even borrowed a shotgun to ward off protesters \u2013 and found himself imprisoned for two months for possessing it after police searched his home. A judge at Hove crown court told him: \u201cThis is not the wild west.\u201d</p> <p>He told the Guardian that he acquired the shotgun after up to 900 protesters had demonstrated outside his house, leading him to fear for his family\u2019s safety. \u201cIt [the shotgun] was what you\u2019d call a backstop,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a terrible situation and the police weren\u2019t looking after us. We were left at the mercy of lunatic gangs of animal rights activists.\u201d</p> <p>He said Seaborne had no plans to carry livestock out of Ramsgate.</p> <p>Eventually, the police withdrew their provision of security because of the high cost of protecting ITF. The company launched a lawsuit designed to reverse the decision and ensure continued protection at taxpayers\u2019 expense, but was unsuccessful.</p> <p>As protests at Shoreham continued, ITF moved its export operation to Dover, but eventually fell victim to the BSE outbreak. The crisis brought an end to the export of cows from Britain to the continent from 1996, a ban that was not lifted until 2006.</p> <p>Dudley, who is believed to live in Dieppe, France, subsequently worked for MyFerryLink, a small cross-Channel service that was owned by Eurotunnel, as its freight and marketing manager.</p> <p>Speaking to Reuters in December, Dudley said: \u201cFor us, the harder the Brexit the better. If Dover and the Channel tunnel are encumbered, our space will go quite quickly.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Ben Sharp</strong></p> <p>The chief executive of Seaborne Freight is listed on the firm\u2019s Companies House page as John Sharp, but told the Guardian he had been known as Ben for most of his life, including by his family.</p> <p>He spent 10 years as a submarine officer in the Royal Navy before setting up a shipping company that ultimately ran aground. Mercator, a ship chartering company, was forced into liquidation by HM Revenue &amp; Customs in 2014 because it was unable to pay a sizeable tax bill. It was not disclosed how much Mercator owed HMRC, but it left a total of \u00a31.78m in unpaid debts. Sharp said Mercator collapsed after a client in the Middle East failed to pay its bills.</p> <p>He later set up another ship operating company, Albany Shipping, but he said this business was put to one side after he was asked to get involved with Seaborne Freight.</p> <p>After details of Seaborne\u2019s contract emerged, Sharp, 61, said he was confident the company would be ready to run a ferry service from Ramsgate to Ostend by the end of March. </p> <h2><strong>Jean-Michel Copyans</strong></h2> <p>Described in the shipping media as a veteran of the ferry industry, he began his career with the marine operations of the French state-owned rail company SNCF and was the chief executive of Seaborne before Sharp joined. According to Companies House, he remains a director of the company and lives in France.</p> <p>Like Dudley, he used to work for MyFerryLink. The business, which operated two ships, was sold to rival DFDS in 2017 amid a monopoly investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority into whether Eurotunnel should be allowed to run cross-Channel ships.</p> <p>Other directors in the company include <strong>Peter Hampton Blackmore</strong>, a solicitor, and <strong>Brian Raincock</strong>, an insurance consultant and a director in Albany Shipping alongside Sharp. Both Raincock and Blackmore work for London-based LML, which funds and insures group litigation.</p> <p>While Seaborne has borne the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/02/grayling-no-deal-brexit-ferry-contract-company-seaborne-freight-no-ships\">brunt of ridicule</a> in the UK over its apparent lack of vessels, it has been reported that a Dutch entrepreneur and insurance broker, <strong>Martin Lanting</strong>, has been appointed as a ship manager. Funding to buy ships on 80% mortgages has been lined up, according to the <a href=\"https://www.tradewindsnews.com/tankers/1486183/french-ferry-veteran-to-head-up-seaborne-freights-dream-team\">TradeWinds journal</a>, which also said investors had been attracted from the UK and Asia.</p>",

It was not disclosed how much Mercator owed HMRC, but it left a total of \u00a31.78m in unpaid debts. Sharp said Mercator collapsed after a client in the Middle East failed to pay its bills. He later set up another ship operating company, Albany Shipping, but he said this business was put to one side after he was asked to get involved with Seaborne Freight. After details of Seaborne\u2019s contract emerged, Sharp, 61, said he was confident the company would be ready to run a ferry service from Ramsgate to Ostend by the end of March. Jean-Michel Copyans Described in the shipping media as a veteran of the ferry industry, he began his career with the marine operations of the French state-owned rail company SNCF and was the chief executive of Seaborne before Sharp joined. According to Companies House, he remains a director of the company and lives in France. Like Dudley, he used to work for MyFerryLink. The business, which operated two ships, was sold to rival DFDS in 2017 amid a monopoly investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority into whether Eurotunnel should be allowed to run cross-Channel ships. Other directors in the company include Peter Hampton Blackmore, a solicitor, and Brian Raincock, an insurance consultant and a director in Albany Shipping alongside Sharp. Both Raincock and Blackmore work for London-based LML, which funds and insures group litigation. While Seaborne has borne the brunt of ridicule in the UK over its apparent lack of vessels, it has been reported that a Dutch entrepreneur and insurance broker, Martin Lanting, has been appointed as a ship manager. Funding to buy ships on 80% mortgages has been lined up, according to the TradeWinds journal, which also said investors had been attracted from the UK and Asia.",

Someone had slipped him a map and he\u2019d noticed the UK is an island and as such a lot of our food arrives by boat, which would be slowed down somewhat by customs checks in the event of no deal. Having got up to speed on GCSE geography and a quick \u201chumans need food to live\u201d biology recap, the cabinet realised they\u2019d have to have boats on standby if we\u2019re going to continue to eat. To this unimportant task they assigned their best and brightest: Chris Grayling, a man you\u2019d supervise if you saw him attempting to use scissors. Grayling set to work, immediately awarding a \u00a313.8m ferry contract to a ferry company that doesn\u2019t own any ferries. To be fair to him, replacing a system that works with an untested ferry firm with zero ships or shipping experience is one of the most concise Brexit summaries we\u2019ve seen so far. Assuming the government has abandoned Brexit and is now spending 100% of its time creating metaphors for how shit Brexit is going, credit where it\u2019s due \u2013 this one is bang on. Grayling said in his defence that the government had \u201clooked very carefully\u201d at the ferry firm on Wednesday and concluded that it was up for the job. So, of course, by Thursday it turned out the ferry firm was actually a pizza delivery firm. Seaborne Freight and a local branch of Papa John\u2019s have an alarming amount in common, it turns out. Neither of them have experience running a ferry, for instance, nor make what a sane person would describe as \u201cfood\u201d. It also transpires that Seaborne Freight, a shipping company, has copied its terms and conditions on its website wholesale from a takeaway delivery business. The company the government has trusted to keep us from starving to death has no money, no track record, no business history or specialist knowledge of the shipping industry. The only thing it seemingly does have is a website you\u2019d happily buy a pizza from, and \u00a313m. Sure they might be terrible at having ferries, but they could also be the most successful Italian takeaway of all time without ever baking a calzone. \u201cYou\u2019re not being fair, terms and conditions are small print,\u201d I hear you say. \u201cThere\u2019s no way the government could have caught that.\u201d Which is why they were found by some random bloke on Twitter using a service inaccessible to government known as \u201ca five-second Google search\u201d. One can only imagine what the government\u2019s \u201ccareful looking\u201d into the company involved. \u201cI\u2019ve found another ferry firm \u2013 it\u2019s all sorted, prime minister.\u201d \u201cNice. How many ferries?\u201d \u201cReally great company.\u201d \u201cLike 10 or 20, we\u2019re gonna need a lot.\u201d \u201cA good, British company.\u201d \u201cHow many ships, Chris.\u201d \u201cA new startup, very keen.\u201d \u201cChris.\u201d \u201cGot a ship in the logo.\u201d \u201cChris.\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d \u201cDoes \u2013 and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m asking this \u2013 does it have any ferries?\u201d \u201cNot strictly speaking.\u201d \u201cGive me that proposal, Chris.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cChris.\u201d \u201cI \u2026\u201d \u201cThis is a pamphlet for a pizza company.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re new, but they\u2019re finger\u2011licking good.\u201d I\u2019ll admit, pizzagate has completely changed my perspective on Brexit, and for the first time in years I\u2019m actually feeling quite positive. On the one hand I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re all going to die, but on the other it\u2019ll admittedly be quite funny to see the NHS destroyed when the Tories accidentally let it be taken over by a kebab vendor who fancies a change of scenery. \u2022 James Felton is a TV and radio comedy writer",

      "bodyText": "Herb Kelleher, the co-founder of Southwest Airlines and pioneer of low-cost aviation, \u201cwithout whom there would be no Ryanair\u201d, has died aged 87. Kelleher set up his budget carrier in Texas more than 50 years ago and changed the face of flying, stripping back costs and inflight services, opening up air travel to a wider range of people. His biggest legacy for Europe may have been as a mentor for Michael O\u2019Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, who flew to Dallas, where Southwest is based, in the 1980s to learn how to run a no-frills airline. Following news of Kelleher\u2019s death on Friday, O\u2019Leary credited the extraordinary growth of the Dublin-based carrier to the lessons of his mentor. \u201cHerb was the grand master Yoda of the low-fare airlines. He was the leader, the visionary and the teacher: without Herb, there would be no Ryanair, and no low-fares airlines anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cHis passing is a sad day for low-fare airlines and sales of Wild Turkey bourbon.\u201d Kelleher had gained publicity from the beginning by promising the lowest fares to customers, or compensating them with a bottle of whiskey if they believed they had paid more than a rival would have charged. Southwest became an industry powerhouse, a brand infused with the colourful, unconventional personality of its boss. The airline\u2019s first flight was in June 1971, and it grew to fly more passengers around the US than any other carrier, spawning a host of imitators at home and worldwide. In a statement announcing his death, Southwest said Kelleher had \u201crevolutionised commercial aviation and democratised the skies\u201d. The company added: \u201cHerb\u2019s passion, zest for life and insatiable investment in relationships made lasting and immeasurable impressions on all who knew him, and will forever be the bedrock and esprit de corps of Southwest Airlines.\u201d As well as his business nous, Kelleher was known for his extrovert antics and flair for a memorable marketing ploy. When executives of other airlines dismissed Southwest as cattle class for the cheap traveller, Kelleher responded with a TV advert featuring his head covered by a paper bag that he promised to give to any potential customer too embarrassed to be seen flying on his airline. On another occasion, when Southwest and a rival company were battling to use the same slogan, Kelleher challenged its chief executive to arm-wrestle for the rights.

As of now, there will be only one minority general manager heading into the 2019 coaching cycle, and it is general managers who play a huge part in hiring head coaches. Raiders general manager Reggie McKenzie was fired last month, and legendary Ravens GM Ozzie Newsome is retiring at the end of the season, handing the reins to his longtime assistant Eric DeCosta, who is white. That leaves Chris Grier as the minority general manager in the NFL: he was promoted by the Miami Dolphins on Monday.</p> <p>Diversity at the decision-making level is what will ultimately lead to diversity on the sidelines. \u201cHiring is more than just a process of skills sorting,\u201d <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0003122412463213\">wrote</a> Kellogg School of Management professor Lauren Rivera in a 2014 study. \u201cIt is also a process of cultural matching between candidates, evaluators, and firms. Employers sought candidates who were not only competent but culturally similar to themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Decision-makers are more likely to hire those who look like them, sound like them, run in the same social circles, or have the same social experiences. The NFL currently has two minority owners. When a person of color walks into a job interview in the NFL, there is a very good chance that they will see a bunch of white faces who have lived different social experiences.</p> <p>So much of this industry revolves around close, personal relationships. Twenty-two of the league\u2019s 32 teams have been owned by the same person or family for at least 20 years. They all have coaches and executives they are particularly connected to. Oakland Raiders owner Mark Davis didn\u2019t hire Jon Gruden because he was the best person for the job. He did so because he liked him. And Gruden didn\u2019t oust McKenzie and hire Mike Mayock as his GM because Mayock has a more illustrious track record as a team builder. He did it because he and Mayock share the same sensibilities.</p> <p>In the past, this has worked to aid some minority candidates, too. Tony Dungy, who became the first black head-coach to win the Super Bowl when the Colts beat the Bears in 2007, has long been an advocate for fellow minorities. Dungy populated his own staffs with minority coaches and has consistently used his profile in the game to bring attention to the issue of diversity. And it\u2019s worked. Dungy and his former assistants account for a staggering 43% of minority head coaching hires over the past two decades and 39% since the Rooney Rule took effect. That is both sad and encouraging \u2013 the same nepotism rules seem to apply to all. Dungy empowered minority assistants, who subsequently went on to become head honchos and empower their own assistants. But there aren\u2019t too many minority coaches with Dungy\u2019s prestige walking around.</p> <p>The NFL tweaked its rules last year in a bid to prevent the kind of Gruden-Davis backroom deal. Owners are now required to sit in on all head coaching interviews. And gone are the days of the sham, in-house interviews with a person of color, meant only to satisfy the logistics of the Rooney Rule and not the spirit. Goodell and the league office, in a rare moment of leadership, understood the difficult position they were putting such minority coaches in.</p> <p>\u201cYou are really stuck between a rock and a hard place,\u201d a former African American NFL head coach <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/coaches-echo-tony-dungys-comments-about-the-good-but-flawed-rooney-rule/\">told CBS Sports</a> in 2016. \u201cYou have the pressure from the <a href=\"https://www.fritzpollard.org/\">Fritz Pollard Alliance</a> to take any interview you are offered \u2018for the good of the cause,\u2019 even if you felt like you are just being used. So you don\u2019t want to let them down.\u201d</p> <p>The league changed the language of the rule. Now owners and decision-makers are required to interview an out-of-house candidate or someone from the league\u2019s pre-approved list: the NFL\u2019s Career Developmental List. It is a far from perfect solution. But it is a start.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/31/the-eagles-are-playoff-bound-the-steelers-arent\">Eagles soar into playoffs as Steelers chances vanish in a single throw | Hunter Felt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One additional issue is the profile of head coaches teams are hiring. More and more they are hiring offensive assistants and quarterback coaches: 15 of the last 20 head coaching hires have had an offensive background. And coaches specializing in offense are overwhelmingly white. In 2018, there were 14 minority coordinators in the NFL, and only two were offensive coordinators.</p> <p>As such, this becomes a fairly simple equation: owners want flashy, exciting hires. An explosive offense is considered more exciting than a feisty defense. There are more white offensive coaches than minority ones. There are more white executives than minorities. People hire candidates with similar backgrounds. Therefore, more white coaches are hired than minority ones, regardless of the make-up of the league generally.</p> <p>All minority candidates have asked for is a fair chance to compete for the top jobs in their sport. To get there, the NFL needs to rethink its model. The Rooney Rule has helped progress, but it remains a flawed rule. Improving diversity at the executive level, and getting more minority coaches into offensive coaching positions is the only way forward.</p>",

More and more they are hiring offensive assistants and quarterback coaches: 15 of the last 20 head coaching hires have had an offensive background. And coaches specializing in offense are overwhelmingly white. In 2018, there were 14 minority coordinators in the NFL, and only two were offensive coordinators. As such, this becomes a fairly simple equation: owners want flashy, exciting hires. An explosive offense is considered more exciting than a feisty defense. There are more white offensive coaches than minority ones. There are more white executives than minorities. People hire candidates with similar backgrounds. Therefore, more white coaches are hired than minority ones, regardless of the make-up of the league generally. All minority candidates have asked for is a fair chance to compete for the top jobs in their sport. To get there, the NFL needs to rethink its model. The Rooney Rule has helped progress, but it remains a flawed rule. Improving diversity at the executive level, and getting more minority coaches into offensive coaching positions is the only way forward.",

      "body": "<p>If you\u2019re one of the 3.1 million Brits who have just embarked on a Dry January, you\u2019re probably already in the grip of Foma. That is, Fear of Missing Alcohol. Contemplating the cold, miserable month ahead, Foma hits with the realisation that there will be no nicely numbing glass of red to rub the edge off a trying day at the office, or turn down the volume on the kids.</p> <p>Perhaps you think a life without alcohol is bound to be dull and monotonous. It will mean the end of your social life; people will think you\u2019re a weirdo, must have a \u201cproblem\u201d with booze, or, worse, that you\u2019ve become judgmental. Foma tells you it will be impossible to \u201cswitch off\u201d; that you and your partner will have nothing to talk about. And as for dating, forget it.</p> <p>I can list these fears easily because I spent the best part of a decade confronting my own Foma. I came of drinking age in the era of the \u201cladettes\u201d, with Zoe Ball and Sara Cox photographed every night skulling pints and being held up as feminist role models. On TV, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/23/sex-and-the-city-made-me-who-i-am\" title=\"\">Sex And The City</a> established pretty pink Cosmopolitan cocktails as a surefire way to get more sex, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kate-moss\" title=\"\">Kate Moss</a> falling drunk out of the Met Bar and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/emin\" title=\"\">Tracey Emin</a> stumbling off the set of a Channel 4 debate were the epitome of grungy glamour.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I began to take breaks from drinking, noticing how much more productive I was without a hangover, how much calmer, more optimistic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a rookie journalist in London, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that the up-for-it, outspoken women I saw killing it career-wise could drink male colleagues under the table. If I wanted to be popular, successful and attractive I, too, would need to get myself \u201cpiss-fit\u201d. Before long, I was sinking Absolut Citron martinis and pints of Stella with the best of them. And so my \u201ccocktail girl\u201d persona was born, one that culminated in a summer where I edited a glossy magazine in Ibiza, with my name on every club guestlist, and a fistful of free drinks tickets to fuel the fun.</p> <p>The cracks began to show in my mid-30s. Having landed a job as features editor on a glossy weekend supplement (not this one), deadlines had got very real. I was consumed by almost constant, teary anxiety. I would wake in the middle of the night in a panicky sweat, heart pounding. I found myself drinking more to paper over the gap between appearance and reality. But a big night out would make my self-esteem plummet and my anxiety shoot even higher; I found myself beginning to question \u2013 privately \u2013 whether the booze was part of the problem.</p> <p>So I began to take extended breaks from drinking, noticing not only how much more productive I was without a hangover, but how much calmer, more optimistic and self-assured. The question got louder, until it was impossible to ignore: would life be <em>better</em> without alcohol? But booze was so interwoven with both my personal and my professional life that the idea of giving it up completely was, well, unthinkable.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Hello Foma, and all the fears that come with it. Fear of being left out. Fear of life becoming boring. Fear of being judged. Fear (whisper it) that I might have a problem with alcohol.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I discovered I didn\u2019t need alcohol to be confident, to let loose, or feel free. I didn\u2019t need alcohol, period</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If you\u2019ve been teaching your brain since, say, age 15, that alcohol is a prerequisite for feeling comfortable in social situations, removing said substance is going to freak you out. Drinking is what we Brits do. And the \u201cgood times\u201d we\u2019ve all experienced when drinking can\u2019t be denied. Oh, we were wild! Carefree! We were dancing on the tables, for Christ\u2019s sake! But as for whether we were\u2026 happy? The abject misery that typically follows this kind of revelry would suggest not; rather that we are simply switching off stress by burying our heads in a salt-rimmed sandpit strewn with empty beer bottles and crumpled cocktail umbrellas. (This in turn feeds into another aspect of our Foma: how the hell will we tackle whatever daily stressors \u2013 from a job we hate to money worries or a failed relationship \u2013 we\u2019ve been trying to escape by drinking?)</p> <p>As I opened my eyes to all this, I became what I called \u201csober curious\u201d. I began to investigate not only the impact that alcohol was having on my productivity and wellbeing, but the underlying reasons why I was so attached to it. Each time I was presented with an opportunity to drink, I would ask: why do I feel the need? How will it make me feel \u2013 in a few hours, tomorrow morning, three days from now? Is the fleeting buzz really worth it? What feeling am I using this drink to experience less or more of? This internal process of self-inquiry saw me steadily drinking less and less.</p> <p>I embarked on a succession of what I call \u201csober firsts\u201d \u2013 my first sober Saturday night, dinner date, birthday party, wedding; those occasions when choosing not to drink can make you feel like a monumental killjoy, not to mention the most awkward person on the dancefloor.</p> <p>What actually happened, to my surprise, is that the more I \u201cfelt the Foma and did it anyway\u201d (including hosting a sober New Moon rave at an island festival on Croatia, and sitting at dinner parties, feeling as square as Ab Fab\u2019s Saffy, while everyone else cracked on), the more I discovered I didn\u2019t need alcohol to be confident, to let loose, or feel free. I didn\u2019t need alcohol, period.</p> <p>My sober curiosity cranked into high gear after I moved from London to New York, where wine gets ordered by the glass as opposed to the bottle, and people are less likely to make you feel as if you not drinking has ruined everybody else\u2019s night. Over time, I found myself socialising more during the day. I discovered the joys of alcohol-free beer. I also found that it helped not to make a big deal about not drinking, and also not to lie or make excuses about why I wasn\u2019t. If anybody asked, I simply replied: \u201cI\u2019m seeing how it feels not to drink.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Say yes to every invitation \u2013 especially to weddings, hen dos and big birthdays \u2013 to prove to yourself you don\u2019t need alcohol</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I had a watershed moment when I attended my first sober hen do (in Liverpool, no less) last spring. The bride-to-be, one of my besties, almost hadn\u2019t invited me as she\u2019d assumed it would be my idea of hell. But there was no way I was going to miss celebrating with her. When I saw the karaoke bar on the itinerary, I told myself that would be the point at which I took myself home to bed. In the event, I was having so much fun with her prosecco-popping posse that I happily tagged along; they could barely get me off the mic. From the pictures that circulated on social media, you\u2019d never know I was the only one not drinking. The resounding conclusion I came to is that the only thing you miss out on by not drinking is\u2026 getting drunk.</p> <p>Many Foma fears are grounded in truth: there <em>will </em>be awkward small talk. Your friends <em>will </em>think you\u2019re being a total bore and won\u2019t let you forget it. But whether you\u2019re just in it for Dry January or considering a more lasting overhaul of your drinking habits after a particularly boozy party season, one thing is for certain. On the other side of Foma, you will emerge feeling more clear-headed, calm, confident and courageous than ever. Not only are you removing a toxic depressant from your system, by facing your fears head on, and proving them wrong, you can\u2019t help but feel a boost.</p> <p>Even at the height of my \u201ccocktail girl\u201d years, I was always secretly in awe of the sober person at the party \u2013 the DJ friend who stuck to soda and stayed out as late as everyone else; or the colleague who bypassed the wine at work events yet was still well-liked. Looking back, it\u2019s obvious that part of me admired the fact they didn\u2019t require a drink to fit in and feel at ease. That actually, I would quite like some of that quiet confidence. And anyway, even Kate Moss is off the sauce these days, having celebrated a year booze-free in October. And if she can do it, why can\u2019t you?</p> <h2><strong>How to beat \u2018fear of missing alcohol\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Beware \u2018euphoric recall\u2019</strong><strong> </strong>Describing our tendency to remember only the good times, euphoric recall is likely to kick in when contemplating yet another sober Saturday night. Instead of focusing on what you\u2019re \u201cdenying\u201d yourself, shift your perspective to what sobriety is cultivating in your life.</p> <p><strong>Play it forward</strong><strong> </strong>Ask yourself: how will drinking tonight make me feel in an hour? By the end of the night? Tomorrow? How will my mood and productivity be affected in the days to come? Honest answers to these questions will help you to abstain.</p> <p><strong>Embrace </strong><strong>sober </strong><strong>firsts</strong><strong> </strong>The temptation when faced with Foma is to cancel your social life until further notice and/or you\u2019ve worked out how not to drink without feeling like a total loser. Rather, RSVP \u201cyes\u201d to each invitation that comes along (especially to weddings, hen dos, big birthdays and weekend getaways) and prove to yourself that you do not need alcohol to socialise. Each event will help to rewire your thinking about drinking.</p> <p><strong>Drink thi</strong><strong>s instead</strong> When you feel like you\u2019re drowning in soda and lime, try alcohol-free beer, tonic water with bitters, or a Seedlip mocktail \u2013 all grownup options that have a pleasing placebo effect.</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t judge</strong> It\u2019s virtually impossible. But how those drunken idiots who used to be your friends choose to waste their weekends, flush their youth down the toilet, and poison their bodies with toxic chemicals is none of your business.

      "bodyText": "If you\u2019re one of the 3.1 million Brits who have just embarked on a Dry January, you\u2019re probably already in the grip of Foma. That is, Fear of Missing Alcohol. Contemplating the cold, miserable month ahead, Foma hits with the realisation that there will be no nicely numbing glass of red to rub the edge off a trying day at the office, or turn down the volume on the kids. Perhaps you think a life without alcohol is bound to be dull and monotonous. It will mean the end of your social life; people will think you\u2019re a weirdo, must have a \u201cproblem\u201d with booze, or, worse, that you\u2019ve become judgmental. Foma tells you it will be impossible to \u201cswitch off\u201d; that you and your partner will have nothing to talk about. And as for dating, forget it. I can list these fears easily because I spent the best part of a decade confronting my own Foma. I came of drinking age in the era of the \u201cladettes\u201d, with Zoe Ball and Sara Cox photographed every night skulling pints and being held up as feminist role models. On TV, Sex And The City established pretty pink Cosmopolitan cocktails as a surefire way to get more sex, while Kate Moss falling drunk out of the Met Bar and Tracey Emin stumbling off the set of a Channel 4 debate were the epitome of grungy glamour. As a rookie journalist in London, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that the up-for-it, outspoken women I saw killing it career-wise could drink male colleagues under the table. If I wanted to be popular, successful and attractive I, too, would need to get myself \u201cpiss-fit\u201d. Before long, I was sinking Absolut Citron martinis and pints of Stella with the best of them. And so my \u201ccocktail girl\u201d persona was born, one that culminated in a summer where I edited a glossy magazine in Ibiza, with my name on every club guestlist, and a fistful of free drinks tickets to fuel the fun. The cracks began to show in my mid-30s. Having landed a job as features editor on a glossy weekend supplement (not this one), deadlines had got very real. I was consumed by almost constant, teary anxiety. I would wake in the middle of the night in a panicky sweat, heart pounding. I found myself drinking more to paper over the gap between appearance and reality. But a big night out would make my self-esteem plummet and my anxiety shoot even higher; I found myself beginning to question \u2013 privately \u2013 whether the booze was part of the problem. So I began to take extended breaks from drinking, noticing not only how much more productive I was without a hangover, but how much calmer, more optimistic and self-assured. The question got louder, until it was impossible to ignore: would life be better without alcohol? But booze was so interwoven with both my personal and my professional life that the idea of giving it up completely was, well, unthinkable. *** Hello Foma, and all the fears that come with it. Fear of being left out. Fear of life becoming boring. Fear of being judged. Fear (whisper it) that I might have a problem with alcohol. If you\u2019ve been teaching your brain since, say, age 15, that alcohol is a prerequisite for feeling comfortable in social situations, removing said substance is going to freak you out. Drinking is what we Brits do. And the \u201cgood times\u201d we\u2019ve all experienced when drinking can\u2019t be denied. Oh, we were wild! Carefree! We were dancing on the tables, for Christ\u2019s sake! But as for whether we were\u2026 happy? The abject misery that typically follows this kind of revelry would suggest not; rather that we are simply switching off stress by burying our heads in a salt-rimmed sandpit strewn with empty beer bottles and crumpled cocktail umbrellas. (This in turn feeds into another aspect of our Foma: how the hell will we tackle whatever daily stressors \u2013 from a job we hate to money worries or a failed relationship \u2013 we\u2019ve been trying to escape by drinking?) As I opened my eyes to all this, I became what I called \u201csober curious\u201d. I began to investigate not only the impact that alcohol was having on my productivity and wellbeing, but the underlying reasons why I was so attached to it. Each time I was presented with an opportunity to drink, I would ask: why do I feel the need? How will it make me feel \u2013 in a few hours, tomorrow morning, three days from now? Is the fleeting buzz really worth it? What feeling am I using this drink to experience less or more of? This internal process of self-inquiry saw me steadily drinking less and less. I embarked on a succession of what I call \u201csober firsts\u201d \u2013 my first sober Saturday night, dinner date, birthday party, wedding; those occasions when choosing not to drink can make you feel like a monumental killjoy, not to mention the most awkward person on the dancefloor. What actually happened, to my surprise, is that the more I \u201cfelt the Foma and did it anyway\u201d (including hosting a sober New Moon rave at an island festival on Croatia, and sitting at dinner parties, feeling as square as Ab Fab\u2019s Saffy, while everyone else cracked on), the more I discovered I didn\u2019t need alcohol to be confident, to let loose, or feel free. I didn\u2019t need alcohol, period. My sober curiosity cranked into high gear after I moved from London to New York, where wine gets ordered by the glass as opposed to the bottle, and people are less likely to make you feel as if you not drinking has ruined everybody else\u2019s night. Over time, I found myself socialising more during the day. I discovered the joys of alcohol-free beer. I also found that it helped not to make a big deal about not drinking, and also not to lie or make excuses about why I wasn\u2019t. If anybody asked, I simply replied: \u201cI\u2019m seeing how it feels not to drink.\u201d I had a watershed moment when I attended my first sober hen do (in Liverpool, no less) last spring. The bride-to-be, one of my besties, almost hadn\u2019t invited me as she\u2019d assumed it would be my idea of hell. But there was no way I was going to miss celebrating with her. When I saw the karaoke bar on the itinerary, I told myself that would be the point at which I took myself home to bed. In the event, I was having so much fun with her prosecco-popping posse that I happily tagged along; they could barely get me off the mic. From the pictures that circulated on social media, you\u2019d never know I was the only one not drinking. The resounding conclusion I came to is that the only thing you miss out on by not drinking is\u2026 getting drunk. Many Foma fears are grounded in truth: there will be awkward small talk. Your friends will think you\u2019re being a total bore and won\u2019t let you forget it. But whether you\u2019re just in it for Dry January or considering a more lasting overhaul of your drinking habits after a particularly boozy party season, one thing is for certain. On the other side of Foma, you will emerge feeling more clear-headed, calm, confident and courageous than ever. Not only are you removing a toxic depressant from your system, by facing your fears head on, and proving them wrong, you can\u2019t help but feel a boost. Even at the height of my \u201ccocktail girl\u201d years, I was always secretly in awe of the sober person at the party \u2013 the DJ friend who stuck to soda and stayed out as late as everyone else; or the colleague who bypassed the wine at work events yet was still well-liked. Looking back, it\u2019s obvious that part of me admired the fact they didn\u2019t require a drink to fit in and feel at ease. That actually, I would quite like some of that quiet confidence. And anyway, even Kate Moss is off the sauce these days, having celebrated a year booze-free in October. And if she can do it, why can\u2019t you? How to beat \u2018fear of missing alcohol\u2019 Beware \u2018euphoric recall\u2019 Describing our tendency to remember only the good times, euphoric recall is likely to kick in when contemplating yet another sober Saturday night. Instead of focusing on what you\u2019re \u201cdenying\u201d yourself, shift your perspective to what sobriety is cultivating in your life. Play it forward Ask yourself: how will drinking tonight make me feel in an hour? By the end of the night? Tomorrow? How will my mood and productivity be affected in the days to come? Honest answers to these questions will help you to abstain. Embrace sober firsts The temptation when faced with Foma is to cancel your social life until further notice and/or you\u2019ve worked out how not to drink without feeling like a total loser. Rather, RSVP \u201cyes\u201d to each invitation that comes along (especially to weddings, hen dos, big birthdays and weekend getaways) and prove to yourself that you do not need alcohol to socialise. Each event will help to rewire your thinking about drinking. Drink this instead When you feel like you\u2019re drowning in soda and lime, try alcohol-free beer, tonic water with bitters, or a Seedlip mocktail \u2013 all grownup options that have a pleasing placebo effect. Don\u2019t judge It\u2019s virtually impossible. But how those drunken idiots who used to be your friends choose to waste their weekends, flush their youth down the toilet, and poison their bodies with toxic chemicals is none of your business. Keep how good you feel to yourself. \u2022 Sober Curious by Ruby Warrington is published by HarperCollins, at \u00a320. To order a copy for \u00a316, go to guardianbookshop.com.

Poussin takes the theme of transience to elaborate allegorical heights in one of his most famous and quoted classical compositions. One of the dancers is Bacchus, god of wine, whose harvest in autumn is an image of maturing and ripeness. To the left of the dancers is a Roman herm that faces both ways, another mythological depiction of time. In the sky is the chariot of the sun god Apollo. It is a bright day, and this is an optimistic and confident painting, for as the seasons trip by they bring different pleasures \u2013 such as autumn\u2019s wine. The circularity of it all is reassuring. The dancers are strong, and strongly connected. Life is an eternal cycle. This dance of time is timeless.<br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://wallacelive.wallacecollection.org/eMP/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=collection&amp;objectId=65042&amp;viewType=detailView\">At the Wallace Collection, London.</a></p> <h2>Image of the week</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a897a04c7122fa15e3249136e506672761f279cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a897a04c7122fa15e3249136e506672761f279cd/0_0_4724_3436/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Cure for Death, from the series What to Do With a Million Years.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"727\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Cure for Death, from the series What to Do With a Million Years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juno Calypso</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFor the last five years I\u2019ve kept a list of dream locations to photograph and this was one of them.

Also showing Turner in January Winter days are illuminated by the artist whose last words were said to be: \u201cThe sun is God!\u201d \u2022 Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh, until 31 January.

William Kentridge Powerful cinematic meditations on modern history, science and the fabric of spacetime itself. \u2022 Whitworth Gallery, Manchester, until 3 March. Mat Collishaw A robotic mask of Elizabeth I gazes in shock at her own portrait in this haunting confrontation between history and technology. \u2022 Queen\u2019s House, London, ongoing. Masterpiece of the week A Dance to the Music of Time, circa 1634-36, by Nicolas Poussin Father Time plays his lyre and the seasons dance to his tune. Poussin takes the theme of transience to elaborate allegorical heights in one of his most famous and quoted classical compositions. One of the dancers is Bacchus, god of wine, whose harvest in autumn is an image of maturing and ripeness. To the left of the dancers is a Roman herm that faces both ways, another mythological depiction of time. In the sky is the chariot of the sun god Apollo. It is a bright day, and this is an optimistic and confident painting, for as the seasons trip by they bring different pleasures \u2013 such as autumn\u2019s wine. The circularity of it all is reassuring. The dancers are strong, and strongly connected. Life is an eternal cycle. This dance of time is timeless. \u2022 At the Wallace Collection, London. Image of the week \u201cFor the last five years I\u2019ve kept a list of dream locations to photograph and this was one of them.

So when Michel Houellebecq\u2019s long-awaited novel, Serotonin, hit French bookstores on Friday morning with a massive print run of 320,000 copies, translations in several countries, and the author for the first time staying silent and refusing any interviews or media promotion, it was proclaimed a national event. The novel\u2019s release was accompanied by the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur, France\u2019s highest national honour, being bestowed on the 62-year-old enfant terrible for his services to French literature by the president, Emmanuel Macron. Serotonin, the story of a lovesick agricultural engineer who writes trade reports for the French agriculture ministry and loathes the EU, has been hailed by the French media as scathing and visionary. The novel rails against politicians who \u201cdo not fight for the interests of their people but are ready to die to defend free trade\u201d. Written before the current gilets jaunes anti-government movement began blockading roundabouts and tollbooths across France, it features desperate farmers in Normandy who stage an armed blockade of roads amid police clashes. Houellebecq and his despairing, white, middle-aged, male narrators are seen as eerie predictors of the national mood. His last novel, Submission, which envisioned a France subjected to sharia law after electing a Muslim president in 2022, was published on 7 January 2015 and featured on the cover of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo just before terrorists stormed the offices of the publication and shot dead 12 people. Platform, his earlier controversial novel about sex tourism and terrorism, came out a year before the Bali bombings of 2002.

Indeed, being trapped in a Parisian bubble as a superstar writer is something Houellebecq has lamented.

Meanwhile, Charlie Hebdo magazine, which in 2015 had featured Houellebecq on its cover as a haggard Nostradamus preparing to celebrate Ramadan, published a brief paragraph saying a new Houellebecq novel was about to be released. \u201cWe won\u2019t be saying anything bad about it: the last time we did wasn\u2019t a success for us.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The magic of the FA Cup will not be readily observable when Blackpool take on Arsenal at Bloomfield Road on Saturday evening. On paper the tie looks tasty enough, with Unai Emery\u2019s first experience of FA Cup football coming at the home of a League One side who fully extended Arsenal in the Carabao Cup fourth round, though little at Blackpool nowadays is exactly as it looks.</p> <p>The most recent home attendance of 10,994, for instance, was unusually high for a club being boycotted by many of their own fans. That was because Blackpool were playing Sunderland, who brought along 7,804 of the paying spectators. The average Blackpool gate this season has been a little over 4,000, a fraction of the 16,000 they used to attract when they reached the Premier League nine years ago.</p> <p>While relegation can have that effect, in a short space of time Blackpool were relegated all the way down to League Two; largely, supporters argue, due to lack of interest and investment from the club owners.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/04/lee-frecklington-interview-lincoln-city-fa-cup\">Lincoln City\u2019s Lee Frecklington: \u2018The FA Cup run created a buzz that has just carried on\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sharp-eyed observers at the Sunderland game will have noticed something unusual going on outside the ground, with protest pamphlets being distributed and \u201cOyston Out\u201d scarves on sale. Just before Christmas, Blackpool made another odd thing happen; Newcastle\u2019s Mike Ashley came only second in a poll of supporters designed to find the league\u2019s most unpopular club owner.

      "bodyText": "The magic of the FA Cup will not be readily observable when Blackpool take on Arsenal at Bloomfield Road on Saturday evening. On paper the tie looks tasty enough, with Unai Emery\u2019s first experience of FA Cup football coming at the home of a League One side who fully extended Arsenal in the Carabao Cup fourth round, though little at Blackpool nowadays is exactly as it looks. The most recent home attendance of 10,994, for instance, was unusually high for a club being boycotted by many of their own fans. That was because Blackpool were playing Sunderland, who brought along 7,804 of the paying spectators. The average Blackpool gate this season has been a little over 4,000, a fraction of the 16,000 they used to attract when they reached the Premier League nine years ago. While relegation can have that effect, in a short space of time Blackpool were relegated all the way down to League Two; largely, supporters argue, due to lack of interest and investment from the club owners. Sharp-eyed observers at the Sunderland game will have noticed something unusual going on outside the ground, with protest pamphlets being distributed and \u201cOyston Out\u201d scarves on sale. Just before Christmas, Blackpool made another odd thing happen; Newcastle\u2019s Mike Ashley came only second in a poll of supporters designed to find the league\u2019s most unpopular club owner. The opprobrium in which the Oyston family are held even has what might be termed official backing \u2013 a high court judge ruled just over a year ago that the club\u2019s assets had been \u201cillegitimately stripped\u201d. According to Christine Seddon of the Blackpool Supporters Trust (BST), the present chairman, Owen Oyston, is less of a pantomime villain than his son Karl, whose time in charge was marked by unseemly spats with supporters and threats of court action. Owen\u2019s more emollient approach and claims to care for the club were effectively undermined by the court case brought by Valeri Belokon, a Latvian businessman whose allegation that the Oystons had misused his financial input was upheld. Most Blackpool fans breathed a sigh of relief when the Oystons were ordered to repay Belokon almost \u00a330m in what seemed a watershed moment, though a year has passed since then, most of the money is still owed, and the club remains in the family\u2019s hands. \u201cWe can\u2019t see what Owen is getting out of the current situation, but he is clinging on and there\u2019s not much we can do about it,\u201d Seddon says. \u201cThat\u2019s how we have ended up with a boycott, because although we love the club we do not want to give the Oystons a penny more.

      "body": "<p>The UK\u2019s farmers face a profound crisis in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and there is dangerous ground ahead even if a deal is agreed, according to the head of the National Farmers\u2019 Union.</p> <p>Minette Batters, the union\u2019s first female leader, is determined to be cautiously positive about Brexit, for which a majority of farmers voted. \u201cWe have to embrace the future \u2026 and make sure we have a goal and a plan,\u201d said Batters, who declined to reveal how she voted in the referendum.</p> <p>But she is extremely worried by the possibility of no deal. In that case, she said, the government had \u201cmade it clear that they would obliterate the tariff wall on food so that products could just keep coming in here without a tax \u2013 that is what they\u2019ve said. Which makes sense, because who wants to see food prices rising?\u201d</p> <p>A government briefing in December suggested that in the event of no deal, the government could allow some products to continue to enter the UK without paying a tariff to keep food prices stable.</p> <p>Batters pointed out that UK farmers would have third-party status and would face high tariffs to sell their goods into Europe. \u201cWe\u2019d be priced out of the market,\u201d she said, claiming that the result for UK farmers would be catastrophic. \u201cForty per cent of our lamb goes to Europe, for just one example. We\u2019re not going to suddenly start eating more lamb here. If we don\u2019t have that export market, what happens to it?\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/quarter-english-farms-bankrupt-after-brexit-2018-4?r=UK&amp;IR=T\">Some experts have predicted</a> that 25% or more of farmers could go out of business in the first year, which Batters does not think is impossible.</p> <p>British food should be selling itself around the world on its high welfare standards and environmental stewardship, Batters argues, and she has laid down an ambition for UK farming to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2040. \u201cWe want to have a big British brand and going to net zero is part of that ambition \u2026 part of a much bigger joined-up plan that delivers on many fronts for society.\u201d </p> <p>Animal welfare and environmental campaigners point out the irony of these moves from the NFU, which resisted environmental and welfare reforms for years.</p> <p>Batters also has reservations about Michael Gove\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/12/gove-hails-plans-to-reward-uk-farmers-for-adopting-green-policies\">plans</a> to move UK farmers away from the EU system of subsidies based on land area and towards a \u201cpublic money for public goods system\u201d, where farmers would be paid for environmental services. The environment secretary\u2019s agriculture bill will go to the House of Lords this month: under its terms, the current subsidy system would be phased out over seven years and the new system phased in.</p> <p>Both Batters and environmental campaigners are concerned that despite trumpeting high UK standards, the government refuses to include them in the legislation. The US has said it will only do a trade deal with the UK if it accepts America\u2019s very different food standards, and there are fears that the British government is trying to leave the door open for a possible US deal, which would have a huge impact on UK farmers. </p> <p>\u201cIt would be very unfair on British farmers and consumers if they were then subjected to product coming in where they\u2019ve had access to things that we\u2019ve had banned in this country,\u201d said Batters.</p> <p>The shadow trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, told the Oxford Farming Conference this week: \u201cThe rhetoric has been great on standards.\u201d But Gardiner said that during the progress of the legislation, every time Labour tried to add amendments to get the standards included, the Conservatives made sure the amendments failed.</p> <p>\u201cLiam Fox is still up for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/18/rightwing-thinktanks-unveil-radical-plan-for-us-uk-brexit-trade-deal-nhs\">\u2018quick and massive deal\u2019</a> with the US,\u201d Gardiner said, claiming that lower food standards could be imposed under the powers the government has given itself.</p> <p>Brexit is just one of a number of existential issues faced by farmers in the next 10 years. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/04/caroline-lucas-green-mp-meat-tax-oxford-farmers-conference-prioritise-sustainability\">A tax is being proposed on red meat</a>, known to be a significant contributor to climate change. Meanwhile, innovative companies around the world have been creating alternatives to milk and meat that are starting to eat up large chunks of the market. Gene editing, robotics and big data are all growing in influence, each presenting different challenges.</p> <p>So are UK farmers ready for the tidal wave of change that is coming their way? \u201cNo,\u201d said Batters. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s a good thing that we have seven years to look at turning things around.\u201d </p>",

Minette Batters, the union\u2019s first female leader, is determined to be cautiously positive about Brexit, for which a majority of farmers voted. \u201cWe have to embrace the future \u2026 and make sure we have a goal and a plan,\u201d said Batters, who declined to reveal how she voted in the referendum. But she is extremely worried by the possibility of no deal. In that case, she said, the government had \u201cmade it clear that they would obliterate the tariff wall on food so that products could just keep coming in here without a tax \u2013 that is what they\u2019ve said. Which makes sense, because who wants to see food prices rising?\u201d A government briefing in December suggested that in the event of no deal, the government could allow some products to continue to enter the UK without paying a tariff to keep food prices stable. Batters pointed out that UK farmers would have third-party status and would face high tariffs to sell their goods into Europe. \u201cWe\u2019d be priced out of the market,\u201d she said, claiming that the result for UK farmers would be catastrophic. \u201cForty per cent of our lamb goes to Europe, for just one example. We\u2019re not going to suddenly start eating more lamb here. If we don\u2019t have that export market, what happens to it?\u201d Some experts have predicted that 25% or more of farmers could go out of business in the first year, which Batters does not think is impossible. British food should be selling itself around the world on its high welfare standards and environmental stewardship, Batters argues, and she has laid down an ambition for UK farming to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2040. \u201cWe want to have a big British brand and going to net zero is part of that ambition \u2026 part of a much bigger joined-up plan that delivers on many fronts for society.\u201d Animal welfare and environmental campaigners point out the irony of these moves from the NFU, which resisted environmental and welfare reforms for years. Batters also has reservations about Michael Gove\u2019s plans to move UK farmers away from the EU system of subsidies based on land area and towards a \u201cpublic money for public goods system\u201d, where farmers would be paid for environmental services. The environment secretary\u2019s agriculture bill will go to the House of Lords this month: under its terms, the current subsidy system would be phased out over seven years and the new system phased in. Both Batters and environmental campaigners are concerned that despite trumpeting high UK standards, the government refuses to include them in the legislation. The US has said it will only do a trade deal with the UK if it accepts America\u2019s very different food standards, and there are fears that the British government is trying to leave the door open for a possible US deal, which would have a huge impact on UK farmers. \u201cIt would be very unfair on British farmers and consumers if they were then subjected to product coming in where they\u2019ve had access to things that we\u2019ve had banned in this country,\u201d said Batters. The shadow trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, told the Oxford Farming Conference this week: \u201cThe rhetoric has been great on standards.\u201d But Gardiner said that during the progress of the legislation, every time Labour tried to add amendments to get the standards included, the Conservatives made sure the amendments failed. \u201cLiam Fox is still up for a \u2018quick and massive deal\u2019 with the US,\u201d Gardiner said, claiming that lower food standards could be imposed under the powers the government has given itself. Brexit is just one of a number of existential issues faced by farmers in the next 10 years. A tax is being proposed on red meat, known to be a significant contributor to climate change. Meanwhile, innovative companies around the world have been creating alternatives to milk and meat that are starting to eat up large chunks of the market. Gene editing, robotics and big data are all growing in influence, each presenting different challenges. So are UK farmers ready for the tidal wave of change that is coming their way? \u201cNo,\u201d said Batters. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s a good thing that we have seven years to look at turning things around.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A three-hour ballet is made up of thousands of tiny moments. The smallest thing \u2013 the lift of an eyeline, the uncurling of a finger \u2013 can be the making of magic, and across those hours there will be fantastic moments and uninspiring ones. And yet sometimes what it all adds up to is, y\u2019know, perfectly OK.</p> <p>Not that there isn\u2019t plenty to admire in Derek Deane\u2019s Swan Lake. It was originally made in 1997 for English National Ballet to perform in the round at the Royal Albert Hall, with an army of swans filling the arena, but this is the slimmed-down version for proscenium theatre. It is easier to tour, even if it is not as exciting and occasionally you can see that there are too many bodies and steps for the size of the stage. But its busyness is also a plus. Swan Lake may be a classic but it is not without its weaknesses. Dramatically speaking, act one is mostly filler, all courtly shenanigans for the corps de ballet, so Deane packs in a billion steps to keep the energy driving forward, with quick footwork and intricate patterning giving texture to the choreography as conductor Gavin Sutherland bounces the orchestra along.</p> <p>The company as a whole are very good. James Streeter brings the drama as sorcerer Rothbart. In the ensemble, Precious Adams shows poise and a lovely weight to her port de bras. There is a flock of well-schooled swans, and there are standout solos in the act one Pas de Trois, especially from Daniel McCormick, winner of ENB\u2019s Emerging Dancer competition last year, whose long legs launch him skyward, every jump and turn perfectly finished. Then there is bright and sparky Julia Conway, hopping on her pointes with light touch and fluttering beats, a young dancer to keep an eye on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6fddc03e0bd379f75d65b8e6c7c835d7c3d1b78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6fddc03e0bd379f75d65b8e6c7c835d7c3d1b78/59_177_5321_3193/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swan Lake at London Coliseum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A flock of well-schooled swans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurent Liotardo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the centre of this energetic court, however, Isaac Hern\u00e1ndez plays Prince Siegfried as a young man whose whole self has been subdued by the pressure of princely expectations. There may be lots going on in Siegfried\u2019s head but it\u2019s not finding its way out in any physical or facial expression \u2013 apart from Hern\u00e1ndez generally looking a bit uncertain. And yet there are surprises. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s energy is so low-key that you almost don\u2019t notice him throw out a casual double tours here and there. And he comes to life in act three with silently soaring grand jet\u00e9s and some elegant turns. Hern\u00e1ndez is a gifted dancer, but there is still room for him to develop as an artist and performer.<br><br>Jurgita Dronina, a principal ENB shares with National Ballet of Canada, is a more confident presence in the central Odette/Odile role, and a solid technician too. She gets better as the evening progresses. Her flustered Odette retains a human element, while as black swan Odile \u2013 her execution impeccably clean, not an ounce of energy wasted \u2013 there is something unreal about her. As she dances with the besotted Siegfried, her eyes are smilingly fixed on Rothbart, making her seem less like a co-conspirator (as she\u2019s usually played) and more like another bewitched puppet in his evil plan. Sadly, there is little chemistry between the leading couple, in either guise, so for all its many merits and standout moments, this Swan Lake ends up feeling somewhat hollow at the core.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://londoncoliseum.org/whats-on/swan-lake-english-national-ballet/?action=book&amp;_ga=2.233600795.421761532.1546601349-8772306.1546601349\">London Coliseum</a> until 13 January.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "A three-hour ballet is made up of thousands of tiny moments. The smallest thing \u2013 the lift of an eyeline, the uncurling of a finger \u2013 can be the making of magic, and across those hours there will be fantastic moments and uninspiring ones. And yet sometimes what it all adds up to is, y\u2019know, perfectly OK. Not that there isn\u2019t plenty to admire in Derek Deane\u2019s Swan Lake. It was originally made in 1997 for English National Ballet to perform in the round at the Royal Albert Hall, with an army of swans filling the arena, but this is the slimmed-down version for proscenium theatre. It is easier to tour, even if it is not as exciting and occasionally you can see that there are too many bodies and steps for the size of the stage. But its busyness is also a plus. Swan Lake may be a classic but it is not without its weaknesses. Dramatically speaking, act one is mostly filler, all courtly shenanigans for the corps de ballet, so Deane packs in a billion steps to keep the energy driving forward, with quick footwork and intricate patterning giving texture to the choreography as conductor Gavin Sutherland bounces the orchestra along. The company as a whole are very good. James Streeter brings the drama as sorcerer Rothbart. In the ensemble, Precious Adams shows poise and a lovely weight to her port de bras. There is a flock of well-schooled swans, and there are standout solos in the act one Pas de Trois, especially from Daniel McCormick, winner of ENB\u2019s Emerging Dancer competition last year, whose long legs launch him skyward, every jump and turn perfectly finished. Then there is bright and sparky Julia Conway, hopping on her pointes with light touch and fluttering beats, a young dancer to keep an eye on. At the centre of this energetic court, however, Isaac Hern\u00e1ndez plays Prince Siegfried as a young man whose whole self has been subdued by the pressure of princely expectations. There may be lots going on in Siegfried\u2019s head but it\u2019s not finding its way out in any physical or facial expression \u2013 apart from Hern\u00e1ndez generally looking a bit uncertain. And yet there are surprises. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s energy is so low-key that you almost don\u2019t notice him throw out a casual double tours here and there. And he comes to life in act three with silently soaring grand jet\u00e9s and some elegant turns. Hern\u00e1ndez is a gifted dancer, but there is still room for him to develop as an artist and performer. Jurgita Dronina, a principal ENB shares with National Ballet of Canada, is a more confident presence in the central Odette/Odile role, and a solid technician too. She gets better as the evening progresses. Her flustered Odette retains a human element, while as black swan Odile \u2013 her execution impeccably clean, not an ounce of energy wasted \u2013 there is something unreal about her. As she dances with the besotted Siegfried, her eyes are smilingly fixed on Rothbart, making her seem less like a co-conspirator (as she\u2019s usually played) and more like another bewitched puppet in his evil plan. Sadly, there is little chemistry between the leading couple, in either guise, so for all its many merits and standout moments, this Swan Lake ends up feeling somewhat hollow at the core. \u2022 At London Coliseum until 13 January.",

      "body": "<p>Celeriac is a bit of a beast to look at, but looks aren\u2019t everything. Beneath that gnarly, knobbly exterior lies creamy white flesh with a sweet, nutty, super-savoury flavour. I turn to celeriac in these winter months; we eat it shaved thinly and raw in salads with a mustardy dressing, cut it into steaks brushed with herbs and griddled, and sometimes roasted whole. Here, though, I use it as the base for a stew with the surprise hit of some cheddar-spiked dumplings on top. It\u2019s also the star of this simple soup, topped with a dukkah-style spicy nut sprinkle, elevating it to something I\u2019d eat any day of the week. You\u2019ll soon be strewing it over everything you cook.</p> <h2>Root vegetable stew with celeriac dumplings (pictured above)</h2> <p>Be sure to peel the celeriac thickly to get rid of any green tinges around the edges, and to remove any stubborn dirt.</p> <p>Prep <strong>20 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>2 hr</strong><br>Serves <strong>6-8</strong></p> <p>For the stew<br><strong>Olive oil</strong><br><strong>6 small red onions</strong>, peeled and quartered<br><strong>1 head garlic</strong>, cloves peeled and left whole<br><strong>3 carrots</strong><br><strong>2 parsnips</strong><br><strong>1kg (approx) celeriac</strong><br><strong>\u00bd bottle red wine</strong><br><strong>1 litre vegetable stock</strong><br><strong>2 bay leaves</strong><br><strong>A few sprigs rosemary leaves</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp harissa</strong><br><strong>Salt</strong><br><strong>1 x 400g tin white beans </strong>(I use haricot)<br><strong>Greens and mustard</strong>, to serve</p> <p>For the dumplings<br><strong>100g celeriac </strong>saved from the stew, grated<br><strong>100g </strong><strong>salted butter</strong>, chilled<br><strong>50g crumbly cheddar</strong><br><strong>200g self-raising flour</strong><br><strong>Salt and black pepper</strong><br><strong>Leaves from a few sprigs of thyme</strong><br><strong>Egg yolk</strong>, for brushing (optional)</p> <p>Heat the oven to 150C (130C fan)/300F/gas 2. Heat a heavy-based casserole over a medium-high flame and add a good glug of olive oil. Add the onions and garlic and cook for five minutes or so, until they begin to brown.</p> <p>Meanwhile, peel and chop the vegetables, making sure you save a 100g piece of celeriac for the dumplings. Once the onions are browned, add the vegetables to the pan and cook for another five minutes, stirring occasionally.</p> <p>Pour in the wine, stock, herbs, harissa and a good pinch of salt, cover with a lid, and put in the oven for an hour and 15 minutes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, make the dumpling mixture. Grate the celeriac and butter into a bowl, crumble in the cheddar, add the flour, salt and pepper, and strip in the leaves of the thyme. Add two tablespoons of very cold water, and use your hands to bring the dumpling mixture together into a nice dough \u2013 if it looks dry, add a few drops more water. Roll the dumplings into 12 balls.</p> <p>Once the stew is ready \u2013 the vegetables should be soft and yielding, the wine reduced \u2013 stir in the beans. Brush the dumplings with egg yolk, if you like, then put them on top of the stew, leaving a little room in between for them to increase in size. Put back in the oven \u2013 no lid this time \u2013 for another 25-30 minutes, until browned on top. Serve with greens and mustard.</p> <h2>Celeriac soup with spicy nut sprinkle</h2> <p>Keep any leftover spices in an airtight jar for up to six months, or put them on the table for extra sprinkling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3af5b091ade56b875ad75d0411d880a1e2520f09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3af5b091ade56b875ad75d0411d880a1e2520f09/0_49_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Jones\u2019 celeriac soup with spicy nut sprinkles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Root manoeuvres: Anna Jones\u2019 celeriac soup with spicy nuts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Russell/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>50 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>6-8</strong></p> <p><strong>Olive oil</strong><br><strong>Butter</strong><br><strong>1 leek,</strong> trimmed and finely sliced<br><strong>1 celeriac</strong>, peeled and roughly chopped<br><strong>4 apples </strong>(I like cox\u2019s), cored and roughly chopped<br><strong>A few sprigs </strong><strong>thyme</strong>, leaves picked<br><strong>1.5 litres vegetable stock</strong><br><strong>1 \u00d7 400g tin</strong><strong> butter beans</strong>, drained<br><strong>Salt and black pepper</strong></p> <p>To serve<br><strong>2 tbsp nuts</strong>, (hazelnuts, almonds, macadamias or cashews), roughly chopped <br><strong>1 t</strong><strong>bsp sesame seeds </strong>(I use a mix of black and white)<br><strong>1 t</strong><strong>sp coriander seeds</strong><br><strong>1 t</strong><strong>sp cumin seeds</strong><br><strong>\u00bd t</strong><strong>sp fennel seeds</strong><br><strong>\u00bd t</strong><strong>bsp nigella seeds</strong><br><strong>\u00bd t</strong><strong>sp turmeric</strong><br><strong>\u00bd t</strong><strong>sp flaked sea salt</strong><br><strong>50g butter</strong><br><strong>Sage and thyme</strong>,<strong> </strong>crisped in butter<br><strong>Yoghurt,</strong> to serve<br><strong>Parathas or naan</strong>, to serve</p> <p>Heat a splash of oil and a knob of butter in a large pan, then cook the leek over a medium heat for 10 minutes, until soft.

      "bodyText": "Celeriac is a bit of a beast to look at, but looks aren\u2019t everything. Beneath that gnarly, knobbly exterior lies creamy white flesh with a sweet, nutty, super-savoury flavour. I turn to celeriac in these winter months; we eat it shaved thinly and raw in salads with a mustardy dressing, cut it into steaks brushed with herbs and griddled, and sometimes roasted whole. Here, though, I use it as the base for a stew with the surprise hit of some cheddar-spiked dumplings on top. It\u2019s also the star of this simple soup, topped with a dukkah-style spicy nut sprinkle, elevating it to something I\u2019d eat any day of the week. You\u2019ll soon be strewing it over everything you cook. Root vegetable stew with celeriac dumplings (pictured above) Be sure to peel the celeriac thickly to get rid of any green tinges around the edges, and to remove any stubborn dirt. Prep 20 min Cook 2 hr Serves 6-8 For the stew Olive oil 6 small red onions, peeled and quartered 1 head garlic, cloves peeled and left whole 3 carrots 2 parsnips 1kg (approx) celeriac \u00bd bottle red wine 1 litre vegetable stock 2 bay leaves A few sprigs rosemary leaves 1 tbsp harissa Salt 1 x 400g tin white beans (I use haricot) Greens and mustard, to serve For the dumplings 100g celeriac saved from the stew, grated 100g salted butter, chilled 50g crumbly cheddar 200g self-raising flour Salt and black pepper Leaves from a few sprigs of thyme Egg yolk, for brushing (optional) Heat the oven to 150C (130C fan)/300F/gas 2. Heat a heavy-based casserole over a medium-high flame and add a good glug of olive oil. Add the onions and garlic and cook for five minutes or so, until they begin to brown. Meanwhile, peel and chop the vegetables, making sure you save a 100g piece of celeriac for the dumplings. Once the onions are browned, add the vegetables to the pan and cook for another five minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour in the wine, stock, herbs, harissa and a good pinch of salt, cover with a lid, and put in the oven for an hour and 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the dumpling mixture. Grate the celeriac and butter into a bowl, crumble in the cheddar, add the flour, salt and pepper, and strip in the leaves of the thyme. Add two tablespoons of very cold water, and use your hands to bring the dumpling mixture together into a nice dough \u2013 if it looks dry, add a few drops more water. Roll the dumplings into 12 balls. Once the stew is ready \u2013 the vegetables should be soft and yielding, the wine reduced \u2013 stir in the beans. Brush the dumplings with egg yolk, if you like, then put them on top of the stew, leaving a little room in between for them to increase in size. Put back in the oven \u2013 no lid this time \u2013 for another 25-30 minutes, until browned on top. Serve with greens and mustard. Celeriac soup with spicy nut sprinkle Keep any leftover spices in an airtight jar for up to six months, or put them on the table for extra sprinkling. Prep 15 min Cook 50 min Serves 6-8 Olive oil Butter 1 leek, trimmed and finely sliced 1 celeriac, peeled and roughly chopped 4 apples (I like cox\u2019s), cored and roughly chopped A few sprigs thyme, leaves picked 1.5 litres vegetable stock 1 \u00d7 400g tin butter beans, drained Salt and black pepper To serve 2 tbsp nuts, (hazelnuts, almonds, macadamias or cashews), roughly chopped 1 tbsp sesame seeds (I use a mix of black and white) 1 tsp coriander seeds 1 tsp cumin seeds \u00bd tsp fennel seeds \u00bd tbsp nigella seeds \u00bd tsp turmeric \u00bd tsp flaked sea salt 50g butter Sage and thyme, crisped in butter Yoghurt, to serve Parathas or naan, to serve Heat a splash of oil and a knob of butter in a large pan, then cook the leek over a medium heat for 10 minutes, until soft. Add the celeriac, apples and thyme, and cook for two to three minutes, then add the stock and butter beans, and season well. Simmer over a low heat for 20-30 minutes, until the celeriac is tender, then remove from the heat and blitz smooth with a hand blender. Keep warm. Toast the nuts and sesame in a frying pan until golden brown, then remove from the pan and set aside. Add the spices to the dry pan and cook for two minutes, until fragrant, shaking the pan so the seeds don\u2019t burn. Crush the spices slightly, then mix in the nuts and flaked sea salt. Remove the spicy nut mix from the pan and set aside if not serving immediately. Add the butter to the empty pan and, once it\u2019s bubbling, remove from the heat and transfer to a plate to cool. Heat a little more butter in the pan and, once hot, add the herbs and cook until crisp, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper. Ladle the soup into bowls and top with a swirl of yoghurt, a drizzle of the butter and a good sprinkling of the spice mix. Finish with crisp herbs, if you like, and a paratha or naan to dunk.",

Tuesday 8 January, 10pm, Channel 4 Icons Here\u2019s an intriguing concept: seven specialists \u2013 including Kathleen Turner, Lily Cole and Chris Packham \u2013 each nominate three 20th-century icons in their chosen field, who are then voted on by the public. The winner progresses to a live final next week. First up, Trevor McDonald nominates a trio of great leaders. Tuesday 8 January, 9pm, BBC Two Friends from College Yes, the Guardian may have described its first season as \u201cinexplicably, one-dimensionally awful\u201d but there is something undeniably watchable about this snarky comedy-drama, returning for a second season this week. You will detest every single character \u2026 while bingeing the entire thing in one sitting. From Friday 11 January, Netflix All the President\u2019s Men Alan Pakula\u2019s heart-racing account of how two Washington Post reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, traced the Watergate break-in back to President Nixon\u2019s office. William Goldman\u2019s masterly, Oscar-winning screenplay extracts all the suspense of the investigation and its riveting detail, without getting bogged down.

Rather than just ballroom disciplines it welcomes performers from a variety of dancing styles \u2013 jazz, ballet, even a bit of disco \u2013 in a contest that promises \u00a350k and a turn on Strictly itself for the winner. Cheryl is among the experts providing pointers. Saturday 5 January, 8pm, BBC One",

      "body": "<p>Pat Barker is sitting in a Durham pub, making a back-of-an-envelope list of all the myth-related books that have been published in the last couple of years. There are 11 so far ranging across fiction and non-fiction and she is particularly taken with an <em>Odyssey</em>-based memoir by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/13/an-odyssey-a-father-a-son-and-an-epic-by-daniel-mendelsohn-review\" title=\"\">Daniel Mendelsohn</a>, which points out that, for all its derring-do, the Homeric epic revolves around a bed (the one to which Odysseus returns and Penelope has kept warm, accepting him back as her husband only when he recognises it as \u201ca living tree\u201d).</p> <p>Barker\u2019s contribution to this growing subgenre is <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/22/silence-of-the-girls-pat-barker-book-review-iliad\" title=\"\">The Silence of the Girls</a></em>, which looks at Homer\u2019s other epic, the<em> Iliad</em>, from the vantage point of the enslaved Trojan queen, Briseis. One of four books in contention for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/costabookaward\" title=\"\">Costa novel of the year</a>, and with a film deal just signed, it has been widely acclaimed as a triumphant departure from her familiar stamping grounds of the first and second world wars. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve had a group of women sitting together over a dish of wine talking about what men are like in bed,\u201d she says. To put it bluntly (as Barker\u2019s women do), Agamemnon prefers \u201cthe back gate\u201d and Achilles is \u201cquick\u201d.</p> <p>The novel is set during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/09/lost-cities-2-search-real-troy-hisarlik-turkey-mythology-homer-iliad\" title=\"\">the siege of Troy</a>, as the Greek army builds up to its final assault, surrounded by the \u201csex slaves\u201d captured in its previous victories. Though the story hasn\u2019t been updated in any overt way, her Greek and Trojan women are gossiping all around us in the homely north of England pub. As she says of her characters: \u201cThey are very north-eastern \u2013 and why not? It\u2019s about toughness, irreverence, humour and bitterness all thrown in together.\u201d</p> <p>Take away the bitterness, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/pat-barker\" title=\"\">the 75-year-old novelist</a> could be describing herself. \u201cIn my personal life I think you\u2019d say there have been a number of prominent women,\u201d she says. It was the storytelling of her working-class grandmother and great-aunts that taught her about the richness of contested history. \u201cThey would argue passionately.

You could think of half a dozen reasons, some optimistic and some non-optimistic,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re bombarded with ephemera. One day a book is top of the bestseller list and six months later you struggle to remember its name; these [classical] stories are thousands of years old. There is an appetite for things that have stood the test of time as our lives change so rapidly. They have an agreed significance, even if we don\u2019t agree on what that significance is.\u201d</p> <p>But as she thinks on, she wonders if something more profound might be going on too. \u201cYou could also say that as people get near their end they return to the beginning. It\u2019s a way of trying to make sense of their experience, but that raises the question of what we are coming to the end of.\u201d Half of her 14 novels have dealt with the fallout from the first and second world wars. \u201cAt the end of the last century there was a return to the first world war. It was an attempt to see what has driven us so far off course,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you could argue, and perhaps it is true, that time\u2019s up: we\u2019re at the end of patriarchy, and I\u2019m fine with that as long as it\u2019s remembered that among the victims of patriarchy the vast majority are men.\u201d</p> <p>Brought up \u201con the pancrack\u201d (national assistance) on Teesside by her beloved grandmother, her personal experience of the domestic catastrophe of warfare was fortuitously limited. Her step-grandfather had a bayonet wound from the first world war and her father \u201cis supposed to have died in the second world war, though I don\u2019t think anybody can be sure what happened because nobody knew who he was. But my mother always presented herself as a widow because it was a terrible shame to have a child without a father.\u201d</p> <p>As to her interest in the wars of antiquity, \u201cI\u2019d have said it only goes back four or five years, but somebody pointed out to me that in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/15/fiction.features\" title=\"\">Life Class</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/15/fiction.features\" title=\"\"> </a>[the 2007 novel that began her second wartime trilogy] there\u2019s a passage in which Elinor Brooke is writing to Paul describing what\u2019s going on in the early days of the first world war and she says it\u2019s exactly like the <em>Iliad</em>. So obviously I must have read it at that point though I didn\u2019t know that I had. I had no classics background. But a writer doesn\u2019t know how far back the germ of a book goes.\u201d She says the inspiration for <em>The Silence of the Girls</em> \u201cprobably goes back to early childhood \u2013 though I can\u2019t remember being a very silent child.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Particularly irksome was the question of whether she could write men \u2013 'as though that were some kind of Everest'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Elinor\u2019s letter turns out to foreshadow her latest book to an uncanny extent. Describing what it is like in London\u2019s once glamorous Caf\u00e9 Royal, which she and Paul used to haunt with their art school set, she writes: \u201cNow it\u2019s full of frightened old men who think their day is over (and they\u2019re probably right) and overexcited young men who jabber till the spit flies, though it\u2019s only stuff they\u2019ve read in the paper. The women have gone very quiet. It\u2019s like the <em>Iliad</em>, you know, when Achilles insults Agamemnon and Agamemnon says he\u2019s got to have Achilles\u2019 girl and Achilles goes off and sulks by the long ships and the girls they\u2019re quarrelling over say nothing, not a word \u2026 I don\u2019t suppose men ever hear that silence.\u201d</p> <p>A paradox of <em>The Silence of the Girls</em> is that Barker\u2019s excavation of that silence has brought her back to the loquacious, female-centred worldview of her earliest work.<em> Union Street</em> (1982), <em>Blow Your House Down</em> (1984) and <em>The Century\u2019s Daughter</em> (1986) were all set in the north-east and published by the feminist imprint Virago. By the end of the decade she was feeling claustrophobic, complaining that she \u201chad got myself into a box where I was strongly typecast as a northern, regional, working class, feminist \u2013 label, label, label \u2013 novelist\u201d. Particularly irksome to her was the recurrent question of whether she could write men \u2013 \u201cas though that were some kind of Everest\u201d.</p> <p>Her response was to leave Virago and begin work on her name-making Regeneration trilogy, which recentred her reputation in the predominantly male arena of warfare \u2013 \u201cor more generally speaking violence, because there\u2019s criminal violence in my work and some domestic violence too, though basically it\u2019s about the trauma of war\u201d. Published in 1991, <em>Regeneration</em> wasn\u2019t the immediate hit it is often now assumed to have been, she points out \u2013 \u201cmost overnight successes in literature took 20 years\u2019 hard slog\u201d \u2013 but the second novel, <em>The Eye in the Door</em>, won her the Guardian fiction award and the third, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1995/nov/08/fiction\" title=\"\">The</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1995/nov/08/fiction\" title=\"\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1995/nov/08/fiction\" title=\"\">Ghost Road</a></em>, scooped the 1995 Booker prize.</p> <p>One of the strengths of her war writing is the unflinching eye she brings to its bodily horrors. Her novels are full of hospitals in which wounded soldiers struggle with psychological and physical mutilation. In <em>Life Class</em> a soldier\u2019s attempt to kill himself leaves \u201chis left eyeball swinging against his cheek\u201d; in <em>The Silence of the Girls</em>, wounds \u201ccrackle\u201d with gangrene (a symptom you can find today on the NHS website). But she is quick to give Homer his due: \u201cThe violence is incredibly accurately described. I do believe that late in the formation of these stories there was a single mind reshaping them and it was a mind that was very familiar with the inside of the human body: with the kidneys, the liver. He could only have learned that on the battlefield.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"45a84d154acf28019230491851fa2f1a3e8c582c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45a84d154acf28019230491851fa2f1a3e8c582c/0_0_2223_2282/974.jpg\" alt=\"Slave girl Briseis pouring a libation for Achilles\u2019 tutor, Phoenix.

Red-figure terracotta cup, 5th century BC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Art Archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But war has its longueurs too, and nowhere more so than in the <em>Iliad</em>, whose endless lists of dead heroes are mocked by Briseis: \u201cAs it happens I know all the names of all the men [Achilles] killed that day. I could recite them to you, if I thought there was any point. But \u2026 how on earth can you feel any pity or concern confronted with this list of intolerably nameless names?\u201d</p> <p>Barker\u2019s search for a female perspective brought her to the realisation that \u201cof course the young men who died were husbands \u2013 and, particularly poignantly, sons\u201d. She gifted to Briseis her belief that the stories of \u201ccommon women whose names you won\u2019t have heard\u201d can humanise history by recalling the childhood foibles of dead heroes or the long labours their mothers suffered giving birth to them.</p> <p>All the same, it was a challenge to maintain interest in the men without breaking faith with Briseis\u2019s chilling insight that the alienation between the warriors and their captives was so complete that \u201cA slave isn\u2019t a person who\u2019s being treated as a thing. A slave <em>is</em> a thing.\u201d To do so, Barker counterpoints Achilles\u2019 contempt for his concubine with his love for his foster brother, Patroclus. Their relationship is sensuously drawn. Are they gay lovers? \u201cI have no hang-ups about writing about gay relationships, as readers of <em>The Eye in the Door</em> will remember, but I didn\u2019t want their relationship to be sweaty buttocks in a tent because I think it\u2019s much more interesting than that. There\u2019s a presexual bond and also they\u2019re brothers in arms, which can be very passionate, though it\u2019s not spoken about in those terms.\u201d</p> <p>Any criticism of the novel has tended to centre on the credibility of her feminised perspective, particularly with regard to Helen, who has a spiky cameo as a style icon contemptuous of less beautiful women\u2019s attempts to copy her eye makeup, and whose tapestries \u2013 full of men \u201cgutted, skewered, filleted\u201d \u2013 are described as \u201ca way of saying: I\u2019m here. Me. A person, not just an object to be looked at and fought over.\u201d Barker is fiercely dismissive of such quibbles, insisting, \u201cAll the anachronisms are deliberate.\u201d Her soldiers are prone to breaking out in bawdy ballads when drunk, \u201cand I keep having to explain that I don\u2019t exactly believe that Homeric warriors were singing English rugby songs either\u201d. What, she asks, does it mean to say a character who never existed was anachronistic? \u201cYou can be anachronistic about Elizabeth I but not about Helen.\u201d</p> <p>In the Trojan war as in many others, she points out, it is women who survive, even if their voices are not reported. \u201cIt\u2019s women who carry the can long-term; not exclusively \u2013 some men become carers for their wounded sons \u2013 but mostly it\u2019s women, long after the politicians have forgotten.\u201d This brings us to the great and enduring subject of doomed youth, which leaves a devastating trail through millennia of warfare and has particular resonance today, a century after the great slaughter of the first world war.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>One side of the immense battiness of Brexit is the young feeling they\u2019ve been done out of something by the old</p> <footer> <cite>Pat Barker</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a remain voter in a strongly pro-Brexit area, she is clear that \u201cone side of the immense battiness of Brexit is the young feeling they\u2019ve been done out of something by the old, which is almost more worrying than the division between London and the rest of the country, although that is also extremely deep.\u201d As a beneficiary of free education \u2013 who went from grammar school to study international history at the London School of Economics and on to a teaching job before getting her first novel published at the age of 40 \u2013 she is acutely aware of the betrayal of young people following behind her: \u201cI doubt I\u2019d be able to go to university today.\u201d While she doesn\u2019t consider herself to be a working-class writer, \u201cin that I don\u2019t write consciously of working-class experience in the way I once did, I always take pride in producing working-class characters who are not just there for light relief as they unforgivably are in many novels about the middle classes.\u201d</p> <p>But one unexpected side-effect of the Brexit earthquake, she believes, is that it has woken up at least some movers and shakers to the dangers of a them-and-us society. \u201cI think publishing is more and more interested in having regional voices. So it was a shock which has its salutary side.\u201d More generally, she is optimistic that women are claiming joint ownership of a world to which they have historically been denied access. \u201cSo yes, I think in that sense time\u2019s up. It gives me a reason to get up in the morning, as it should every woman.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Silence of the Girls</em> is published by Hamish Hamilton.

There are 11 so far ranging across fiction and non-fiction and she is particularly taken with an Odyssey-based memoir by Daniel Mendelsohn, which points out that, for all its derring-do, the Homeric epic revolves around a bed (the one to which Odysseus returns and Penelope has kept warm, accepting him back as her husband only when he recognises it as \u201ca living tree\u201d). Barker\u2019s contribution to this growing subgenre is The Silence of the Girls, which looks at Homer\u2019s other epic, the Iliad, from the vantage point of the enslaved Trojan queen, Briseis.

But a writer doesn\u2019t know how far back the germ of a book goes.\u201d She says the inspiration for The Silence of the Girls \u201cprobably goes back to early childhood \u2013 though I can\u2019t remember being a very silent child.\u201d Elinor\u2019s letter turns out to foreshadow her latest book to an uncanny extent. Describing what it is like in London\u2019s once glamorous Caf\u00e9 Royal, which she and Paul used to haunt with their art school set, she writes: \u201cNow it\u2019s full of frightened old men who think their day is over (and they\u2019re probably right) and overexcited young men who jabber till the spit flies, though it\u2019s only stuff they\u2019ve read in the paper. The women have gone very quiet. It\u2019s like the Iliad, you know, when Achilles insults Agamemnon and Agamemnon says he\u2019s got to have Achilles\u2019 girl and Achilles goes off and sulks by the long ships and the girls they\u2019re quarrelling over say nothing, not a word \u2026 I don\u2019t suppose men ever hear that silence.\u201d A paradox of The Silence of the Girls is that Barker\u2019s excavation of that silence has brought her back to the loquacious, female-centred worldview of her earliest work. Union Street (1982), Blow Your House Down (1984) and The Century\u2019s Daughter (1986) were all set in the north-east and published by the feminist imprint Virago. By the end of the decade she was feeling claustrophobic, complaining that she \u201chad got myself into a box where I was strongly typecast as a northern, regional, working class, feminist \u2013 label, label, label \u2013 novelist\u201d. Particularly irksome to her was the recurrent question of whether she could write men \u2013 \u201cas though that were some kind of Everest\u201d. Her response was to leave Virago and begin work on her name-making Regeneration trilogy, which recentred her reputation in the predominantly male arena of warfare \u2013 \u201cor more generally speaking violence, because there\u2019s criminal violence in my work and some domestic violence too, though basically it\u2019s about the trauma of war\u201d. Published in 1991, Regeneration wasn\u2019t the immediate hit it is often now assumed to have been, she points out \u2013 \u201cmost overnight successes in literature took 20 years\u2019 hard slog\u201d \u2013 but the second novel, The Eye in the Door, won her the Guardian fiction award and the third, The Ghost Road, scooped the 1995 Booker prize. One of the strengths of her war writing is the unflinching eye she brings to its bodily horrors. Her novels are full of hospitals in which wounded soldiers struggle with psychological and physical mutilation. In Life Class a soldier\u2019s attempt to kill himself leaves \u201chis left eyeball swinging against his cheek\u201d; in The Silence of the Girls, wounds \u201ccrackle\u201d with gangrene (a symptom you can find today on the NHS website). But she is quick to give Homer his due: \u201cThe violence is incredibly accurately described. I do believe that late in the formation of these stories there was a single mind reshaping them and it was a mind that was very familiar with the inside of the human body: with the kidneys, the liver. He could only have learned that on the battlefield.\u201d But war has its longueurs too, and nowhere more so than in the Iliad, whose endless lists of dead heroes are mocked by Briseis: \u201cAs it happens I know all the names of all the men [Achilles] killed that day. I could recite them to you, if I thought there was any point. But \u2026 how on earth can you feel any pity or concern confronted with this list of intolerably nameless names?\u201d Barker\u2019s search for a female perspective brought her to the realisation that \u201cof course the young men who died were husbands \u2013 and, particularly poignantly, sons\u201d. She gifted to Briseis her belief that the stories of \u201ccommon women whose names you won\u2019t have heard\u201d can humanise history by recalling the childhood foibles of dead heroes or the long labours their mothers suffered giving birth to them. All the same, it was a challenge to maintain interest in the men without breaking faith with Briseis\u2019s chilling insight that the alienation between the warriors and their captives was so complete that \u201cA slave isn\u2019t a person who\u2019s being treated as a thing. A slave is a thing.\u201d To do so, Barker counterpoints Achilles\u2019 contempt for his concubine with his love for his foster brother, Patroclus. Their relationship is sensuously drawn. Are they gay lovers? \u201cI have no hang-ups about writing about gay relationships, as readers of The Eye in the Door will remember, but I didn\u2019t want their relationship to be sweaty buttocks in a tent because I think it\u2019s much more interesting than that. There\u2019s a presexual bond and also they\u2019re brothers in arms, which can be very passionate, though it\u2019s not spoken about in those terms.\u201d Any criticism of the novel has tended to centre on the credibility of her feminised perspective, particularly with regard to Helen, who has a spiky cameo as a style icon contemptuous of less beautiful women\u2019s attempts to copy her eye makeup, and whose tapestries \u2013 full of men \u201cgutted, skewered, filleted\u201d \u2013 are described as \u201ca way of saying: I\u2019m here. Me. A person, not just an object to be looked at and fought over.\u201d Barker is fiercely dismissive of such quibbles, insisting, \u201cAll the anachronisms are deliberate.\u201d Her soldiers are prone to breaking out in bawdy ballads when drunk, \u201cand I keep having to explain that I don\u2019t exactly believe that Homeric warriors were singing English rugby songs either\u201d. What, she asks, does it mean to say a character who never existed was anachronistic? \u201cYou can be anachronistic about Elizabeth I but not about Helen.\u201d In the Trojan war as in many others, she points out, it is women who survive, even if their voices are not reported. \u201cIt\u2019s women who carry the can long-term; not exclusively \u2013 some men become carers for their wounded sons \u2013 but mostly it\u2019s women, long after the politicians have forgotten.\u201d This brings us to the great and enduring subject of doomed youth, which leaves a devastating trail through millennia of warfare and has particular resonance today, a century after the great slaughter of the first world war. As a remain voter in a strongly pro-Brexit area, she is clear that \u201cone side of the immense battiness of Brexit is the young feeling they\u2019ve been done out of something by the old, which is almost more worrying than the division between London and the rest of the country, although that is also extremely deep.\u201d As a beneficiary of free education \u2013 who went from grammar school to study international history at the London School of Economics and on to a teaching job before getting her first novel published at the age of 40 \u2013 she is acutely aware of the betrayal of young people following behind her: \u201cI doubt I\u2019d be able to go to university today.\u201d While she doesn\u2019t consider herself to be a working-class writer, \u201cin that I don\u2019t write consciously of working-class experience in the way I once did, I always take pride in producing working-class characters who are not just there for light relief as they unforgivably are in many novels about the middle classes.\u201d But one unexpected side-effect of the Brexit earthquake, she believes, is that it has woken up at least some movers and shakers to the dangers of a them-and-us society. \u201cI think publishing is more and more interested in having regional voices. So it was a shock which has its salutary side.\u201d More generally, she is optimistic that women are claiming joint ownership of a world to which they have historically been denied access. \u201cSo yes, I think in that sense time\u2019s up. It gives me a reason to get up in the morning, as it should every woman.\u201d \u2022 The Silence of the Girls is published by Hamish Hamilton.

This could be Alexander Zverev\u2019s time, or maybe the 2019 Australian Open will belong to Stefanos Tsitsipas or Daniil Medvedev. And Australians may even celebrate their first home slam men\u2019s winner since Mark Edmondson 43 years ago if the 19-year-old Alex de Minaur can continue to perform minor miracles. At 212 in the world, Edmondson was and remains the lowest-ranked slam champion of the Open era; dreams do come true. For Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray, however, there have been only recurring nightmares, and in the past week their thin prospects of revisiting former glories receded rapidly. All around them, the young wolves are gathering. Only Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer from that golden era look capable of holding the line in five-setters \u2013 and they, too, are intermittently vulnerable, as Zverev showed in the ATP Finals in November, when he beat them in back-to-back matches. While it is unlikely Murray will withdraw before the start of the tournament on Monday week \u2013 as he did a year ago for hip surgery that delivered him hope but no miracle \u2013 his compadre is struggling to make it to the starting line with a shopping list of injuries that would keep an A&amp;E ward busy for a month. Nadal\u2019s left thigh joined his hip and other connected sinews in forcing his late withdrawal from the Brisbane International this week, his ninth in 13 of his most recent tournaments. Those are startling numbers and they suggest the end is rushing at the 32-year-old like a gored bull \u2013 although five tournament wins in 2018, including the French Open, alongside semi-final runs at Wimbledon and Flushing Meadows, illuminated the gloom. He also defeated Zverev on the clay of Valencia and Rome and Tsitsipas in Barcelona, as well as on the hardcourts of Toronto. Murray, who beat only two top-20 players among five wins in 12 matches, had no such balm. When the loose-limbed young Russian power-hitter Medvedev blew him away in an hour and 21 minutes in Brisbane on Wednesday, the former world No 1 and three-time slam champion was reminded that, at 31, merely being competitive is going to be his biggest challenge over the championship fortnight. And when Medvedev dug deep to beat Milos Raonic 6-7 (2), 6-3, 6-4 in the quarter-finals on Friday \u2013 saving three set points on his own serve to force the tie-break \u2013 Murray will have recognised a fellow grinder on the way up. A year ago here Nadal was playing tennis reminiscent of his run to the title in 2009 and to the 2017 decider against Federer \u2013 until his collapse with a leg and hip injury in the quarter-final against Marin Cilic, a retirement that set in train a wretched completion record for the rest of his campaign. \u201cIf we keep playing on these very, very hard surfaces,\u201d Nadal complained later, \u201cwhat\u2019s going to happen in the future with our lives?\u201d The answer might not be far away.",

      "body": "<p>One morning in 1988, Trix Worrell, a young St Lucia-born writer, was sat on the top deck of the number 36 bus going from Peckham to central London. He had just won Channel 4\u2019s debut writing competition, and had been invited to meet distinguished producer Humphrey Barclay and propose a new black sitcom.</p> <p>But he had no idea what to pitch, and had never written comedy before. As the bus stopped at the traffic lights on the Queens Road, he was drawn to a scene below in a West Indian barber shop.</p> <p>\u201cIt was called Fair Deal,\u201d recalls Worrell, \u201cand there were these barbers, their noses pressed against the front window, chirpsing the girls walking past. And I could see the customers in their chairs, half-lathered and half-shaved, waiting to get their hair cut, but thinking nothing of it whatsoever. That\u2019s when it came to me.\u201d</p> <p>Worrell knew barber shops as hives of chat and gossip conducted over endless games of dominoes \u2013 and where the chances of getting an actual haircut were sometimes slim. \u201cThe black barber is a community and a drop-in,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd, more crucially, a space where black people can just be black.\u201d</p> <p>By the time he reached Barclay\u2019s office, the kernel had crystallised into what would become Channel 4\u2019s longest-running sitcom, Desmond\u2019s, aired for the first time on 5 January the following year. But to hear Barclay tell it, the show almost never came to light.</p> <p>\u201cMy heart sank at his pitch,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThere had already been several series set in salons, which tended to feature ladies with blue hair. So I wasn\u2019t excited at all. But he shook his head and said, \u2018Have you ever been in a West Indian barber shop?\u2019 Then he started to tell me more. The more he told, the more I liked it.\u201d</p> <p>Desmond\u2019s was not the first black sitcom on British TV \u2013 that would be The Fosters, which ran from 1976 to 1977, featuring Norman Beaton and Carmen Munroe (who played Desmond and Shirley Ambrose) and a young Lenny Henry. That show, however, was not an original creation, adapted from US sitcom Good Times. So what marked Desmond\u2019s out?</p> <p>\u201cIt was the first black business you really saw on television,\u201d says Worrell. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that the guy can\u2019t cut hair! More than that, the underlying principle was if you\u2019re a minority in a predominantly white society, you have to laugh. Comedy is what keeps you going.\u201d</p> <p>The show\u2019s popularity was cemented by the second episode of the second series, Hold De Front Page, in which the barber shop was held up by two violent, if hapless, teenagers armed with guns. It was uncharted waters for a British sitcom and by the end of that series, five million people were tuning in.</p> <p>\u201cWe knew we were doing something different,\u201d says Worrell. \u201cI have to take my hat off to Michael Grade [then chief executive of Channel 4], who supported us when it was a real risk. But it reflected the growing violence on the streets.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"85c6b14c50d636adfb20a2088cf07321ee341a6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85c6b14c50d636adfb20a2088cf07321ee341a6b/0_88_1536_922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We knew we were doing something different.

Desmond, played by the late Beaton, dreams of retiring and returning to Guyana; Shirley, his wife, enrols in a French evening class in the opening episode; yuppy eldest son Michael aims to run the local bank; middle child Gloria wants to be a fashion writer; and youngest son Sean is on course to go to university.</p> <p>Like most great sitcoms, Desmond\u2019s thrives on its running gags and side characters: the frequent jubilant cry \u201cYeah, mon\u201d of Desmond\u2019s best friend Porkpie; Matthew, the perennial student from the Gambia with a penchant for \u201cold African sayings\u201d such as \u201cthe respectful goat doesn\u2019t fart in front of the chief\u201d; and gossiping hypochondriac Beverley.</p> <p>Filmed in front of a raucous live audience (\u201cthose guys were off the Richter scale,\u201d says Worrell), Desmond\u2019s, at its best, was an exultant celebration of family and friendship in the face of adversity. In the show\u2019s most poignant episode, Georgetown Dreaming, Desmond ponders what life might have been if he had never come to this \u201cgodforsaken country\u201d.</p> <p>Might he already be retired, having achieved glory through the Georgetown Dreamers, his one-time band? Would his children have escaped racism and discrimination? Or as Shirley \u2013 always the voice of reason \u2013 points out, \u201cwe could have done a lot worse\u201d. Cue an alternate history of squalor in the Caribbean, with Desmond a milquetoast, Shirley a drunk and Michael a violent hoodlum.</p> <p>At its core, Desmond\u2019s<em> \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad</em>was a family show, says Ram John Holder, who played Porkpie, its warmth transcending racial fault lines. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter if you were black or brown or white,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was the story of every family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t write Desmond\u2019s for black people,\u201d says Worrell. \u201cI wrote it for white people so they could see how black people really are. At that time, the negative press about muggings and shootings was all we seemed to get. I was fed up with it.\u201d</p> <p>Desmond\u2019s ran for 71 episodes, ending in 1994 due to Beaton\u2019s health. Danny Boyle featured <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4As0e4de-rI?t=3864\">a clip</a> in the best-of-British-TV segment of his 2012 Olympics opening ceremony, and the series is now available to watch on All 4. But its legacy is also local, and community drama group <a href=\"https://www.theatrepeckham.co.uk/home/current-shows/\">Theatre Peckham</a> will perform the first ever episode on 5 January to coincide with the anniversary.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an important part of the cultural history of this country,\u201d says Holder. \u201cAn artistic achievement.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen I started out, they made braver choices in television,\u201d says Worrell. \u201cWhile there might be all these workshops today to increase the presence of minorities on screen, it\u2019s just about boxes being ticked.

      "body": "<p>Tinned corned beef* is a product that resists reinvention. Slouched on bright yellow beanbags in the \u201cideas hub\u201d at an east London branding agency, the bright marketing sparks charged with this task must look on in despair as a cornucopia of 1970s processed foods, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/dec/16/arctic-roll-birds-eye\">Arctic roll</a> to Findus crispy pancakes, take on an ironic halo of #noshtalgia, while corned beef remains beyond the pale.</p> <p>Indelibly linked with the grey Britain of postwar rationing, corned beef suffers from ugly snobbery. \u201cSo stigmatised, it is deemed only fit for pensioners or the unemployed,\u201d as one fan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/feb/16/food.foodanddrink\">once wrote</a> in the Guardian (note: Essex\u2019s Becontree Estate was nicknamed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/oct/09/bartons-britain-becontree-estate\">Corned Beef City </a>as a dig at the poverty of its residents). Today, corned beef is most likely to crop up, not in recipes in glossy magazine (high-quality traditional makers <a href=\"https://www.mccartneysofmoira.com/news/20/\">are incredibly rare</a>), but in inescapably demoralising lists of what you should donate to food banks or stockpile in the event of a chaotic no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>It is a food dogged by an aura of crisis, deprivation and controversy. Over the centuries, it has been blamed for exacerbating everything from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corned_beef\">the Irish potato famine</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/aug/03/healthandwellbeing.health\">obesity levels in Tonga</a>. In recent years, it has been embroiled in scandals about<a href=\"https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/buying-and-supplying/sourcing/uk-taste-for-corned-beef-helping-drive-illegal-deforestation-claims-report/515466.article\"> deforestation </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jun/06/waitrose-pulls-its-corned-beef-off-shelves-after-guardian-reveals-alleged-slavery-links-brazil\">slave labour </a>in South America, and the contamination of beef supplies with <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/9983615/FSA-reassures-public-after-horse-drug-found-in-Asda-corned-beef.html\">horsemeat </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/apr/09/veterinary-drug-bute-asda-corned-beef\">veterinary painkillers</a>. Look past that dread PR and find a corned beef brand<a href=\"https://www.princes.co.uk/our-products/meat-ready-meals-and-pies/corned-beef/product-corned-beef/\"> that reports a firm commitment to sustainability,</a> and, even then, you have to wrestle your shopping into submission due to a bizarre insistence among manufacturers on using<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-2642,00.html\"> those weird tapered tins</a>, opened with tiny keys that frequently do not work. Dogged consumers are left digging meat out from between razor-sharp edges with a kitchen knife, having finally prised open that obtusely shaped can with a tin opener \u2026 or a hammer and chisel.</p> <p>Yet, despite all that baggage, say the words: corned beef hash, and, immediately, a significant proportion of Britain will begin to drool \u2013 transported by a meal that can provide comfort in even the bleakest of mid-winters. Corned beef hash satisfies something deep in the freezing northern European soul. But only if it is done right, which is where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/series/how-to-eat\">How to Eat </a>[HTE] \u2013 the series examining how best to eat Britain\u2019s favourite foods \u2013 comes in.</p> <p><em>* Not to be confused with what Americans (and, historically, <a href=\"https://www.slowfood.org.uk/ff-products/ulster-corned-beef/\">the Irish</a>) call \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cooksinfo.com/corned-beef\">corned beef</a>\u201d, known in Britain as salt beef.

It is now frequently rendered as a mess of hard-fried potatoes, onions and salt beef.</p> <p>Objectively, at its best, this US interloper may be a tastier dish, a superior creation, but it is not what we commonly expect of corned beef hash. It is unfamiliar and, in its lack of density and heft, gravy and soothing mash, the comforting qualities of the UK original are absent. It is a gastronomic elevation of a dish that, instead, should be the simplest of reassuring nursery foods. Metaphorically and psychologically speaking, it is a stiff pat on the back from a confident, stylish New Yorker, when, deep down, what you really want is a soft, all-enveloping hug from mummy (AKA the mashed potato).</p> <p>There is some intermediate (con)fusion of the US-UK methods. Some people simmer the potatoes and other ingredients in stock until soft or layer the potatoes like a hotpot and, variously, oven bake them (and even cover the hash with cheese and grill it; this <em>is not </em>a shepherd\u2019s pie!). But, to be blunt, all those methods are wrong. This dish is a mashed potato-based meal.</p> <p>There is some suggestion that the basic, classic form of hash \u2013 fried onions, mash, chopped corned beef \u2013 is most prevalent in the north-west of England. If this is true, it confirms that region\u2019s leadership in this field. If you wish (it is a bit of a faff), you can cook then fry off the mash mixture in patties and break those up before serving \u2013 in order to build a little welcome crunch into the hash \u2013 but, at root, the corned beef hash should be a huge, soft hill that you can smoothly motor through with a spoon.</p> <h2><strong>Gravy</strong></h2> <p>Fundamentally, corned beef hash is <em>all about </em>the gravy. The gravy is the mighty meaty wave, the savoury tsunami, the rip current that should wash over and drown this otherwise bland dish in flavour. It should sweep you off your feet. Start with a butter, garlic, onion and beef stock base, and then freestyle with whatever you have to hand: old red wine, brown sauce, soy, Worcestershire sauce, to broaden and add 3D depth to that canvas.</p> <h2><strong>Heat</strong></h2> <p>A gentle tingle at the fringes of your hash is not unwelcome (tabasco, grain mustard etc), but cook it in as you fry your initial onions. That will take the edge of it. This is not a dish to enliven with fresh chillies or hot sauce. Both would clash horribly with the gravy. Any heat should shimmer in the distance, way behind the gravy\u2019s savoury thwack. A little spicy kick, a gentle underlying heat is fine, anything palpably chilli hot is not.</p> <h2><strong>Egg</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"066601008434cec10c71fb8526f1e14ace1f5ba3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/066601008434cec10c71fb8526f1e14ace1f5ba3/0_440_3800_2280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"coprned bef hash eggs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sunny-side up \u2026 eggs are a must, although this hash could also use more gravy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Woman\u2019s Weekly/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yes, yes and thrice yes. Fried not poached, please. This is not a dish in which concern for your arteries should figure. Be in no doubt, we are troughing here. This is a meal that should immobilise you. Leave you bloated and beached. Clear your diary. But that egg is not mere gluttony, it makes culinary sense, too. The soft yolk adds a layer of richness and the texture of that fried white is a creamy counterpoint to the starchy potato.</p> <h2><strong>Vegetable, sides and garnishes</strong></h2> <p>Does corned beef hash need any? Arguably, no. Add a condiment [see, sauces], and you have a complete meal. However, there are certain vegetables that will bring a new mineral dimension to the dish. It is rather like putting a conservatory on a perfectly liveable suburban semi. It might be nice. But it is not essential.</p> <p><strong>Good:</strong></p> <p>Shredded, buttered cabbage, sprouts or other veg (eg broccoli) that offers a pointed iron-rich tang.</p> <p>A little scattered crispy bacon or crispy onions: both of which add a some textural va va voom and, respectively, complementary layers of salty or sweet flavour.</p> <p>Pickled red cabbage or beetroot; their vinegary sharpness is a kind of fastidious punctuation of this otherwise overly verbose, long-winded paragraph. Each brings definition and clarity to the dish, periodically clearing your palate (and mind) before the next meat \u2019n\u2019 potatoes assault.</p> <p><strong>Bad:</strong></p> <p>Peas, like carrots, are ineffectual in a corned beef hash, unless you add them by the bucket (turning it into a very different dish). The hint of sweetness they provide is too meek to assert itself.</p> <p>Fresh or fried bell peppers have no place in this dish \u2026 or in food generally (see also, oven-roasted tomatoes).</p> <p>Sweetcorn: no.</p> <p>Baked beans: is that middling, juvenile sweetness really sufficient yin to the yang of the hash? In HTE\u2019s opinion, it is not.</p> <p>Asparagus is probably the most overrated vegetable on Earth and, in a dish that you are going to tackle with a spoon and fork, is a logistical minefield. If you need to get a knife out to cut anything in a corned beef hash, you have failed at the dish.</p> <p>Creamed spinach (or any creamed vegetable) will make an unholy, murky mess of your gravy; think: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2014/mar/24/exxon-valdez-oil-spill-disaster-arctic\">Exxon Valdez-style</a> pollution.</p> <p>The fallback of middling pub chefs and pretentious home cooks, this dish does not require any titivation with twee, tied bundles of chives or fronds of flat-leaf parsley. Neither adds anything to a hash, other than an unpleasant sense that someone has emptied their lawnmower over your tea.</p> <p>Bread: ordinarily, HTE is firmly in the bread-with-everything, carbs-on-carbs camp. But, c\u2019mon, this is an unusually filling meal. Serving it with buttered sourdough or soda bread is overkill.</p> <h2><strong>Sauces</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d35a8fa76915f305c16594f1f6bd585d6caf234\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d35a8fa76915f305c16594f1f6bd585d6caf234/0_366_5700_3420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"tomato ketchup\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Red alert \u2026 the only condiment you need with corned beef hash (serving suggestion, writer\u2019s own).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You will occasionally see people (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_(food)#Other_countries\">Scandinavians, mostly</a>), arguing that a hash should be served with a dollop of hollandaise or b\u00e9arnaise, but that seems an unnecessarily rich addition to such a gutsy dish.

      "bodyText": "Tinned corned beef* is a product that resists reinvention. Slouched on bright yellow beanbags in the \u201cideas hub\u201d at an east London branding agency, the bright marketing sparks charged with this task must look on in despair as a cornucopia of 1970s processed foods, from the Arctic roll to Findus crispy pancakes, take on an ironic halo of #noshtalgia, while corned beef remains beyond the pale. Indelibly linked with the grey Britain of postwar rationing, corned beef suffers from ugly snobbery. \u201cSo stigmatised, it is deemed only fit for pensioners or the unemployed,\u201d as one fan once wrote in the Guardian (note: Essex\u2019s Becontree Estate was nicknamed Corned Beef City as a dig at the poverty of its residents). Today, corned beef is most likely to crop up, not in recipes in glossy magazine (high-quality traditional makers are incredibly rare), but in inescapably demoralising lists of what you should donate to food banks or stockpile in the event of a chaotic no-deal Brexit. It is a food dogged by an aura of crisis, deprivation and controversy. Over the centuries, it has been blamed for exacerbating everything from the Irish potato famine to obesity levels in Tonga. In recent years, it has been embroiled in scandals about deforestation and slave labour in South America, and the contamination of beef supplies with horsemeat and veterinary painkillers. Look past that dread PR and find a corned beef brand that reports a firm commitment to sustainability, and, even then, you have to wrestle your shopping into submission due to a bizarre insistence among manufacturers on using those weird tapered tins, opened with tiny keys that frequently do not work. Dogged consumers are left digging meat out from between razor-sharp edges with a kitchen knife, having finally prised open that obtusely shaped can with a tin opener \u2026 or a hammer and chisel. Yet, despite all that baggage, say the words: corned beef hash, and, immediately, a significant proportion of Britain will begin to drool \u2013 transported by a meal that can provide comfort in even the bleakest of mid-winters. Corned beef hash satisfies something deep in the freezing northern European soul. But only if it is done right, which is where How to Eat [HTE] \u2013 the series examining how best to eat Britain\u2019s favourite foods \u2013 comes in. * Not to be confused with what Americans (and, historically, the Irish) call \u201ccorned beef\u201d, known in Britain as salt beef. That is a very different food to canned corned beef: salted beef offcuts, minced and suspended in their own fat, sterilised and shipped to Europe from South America. Mashed potato v fried potatoes Talking of transatlantic confusion (nay, cultural imperialism), in the aftermath of Britain\u2019s early-2010s obsession with trashy US diner food, be careful when ordering corned beef hash. It is now frequently rendered as a mess of hard-fried potatoes, onions and salt beef. Objectively, at its best, this US interloper may be a tastier dish, a superior creation, but it is not what we commonly expect of corned beef hash. It is unfamiliar and, in its lack of density and heft, gravy and soothing mash, the comforting qualities of the UK original are absent. It is a gastronomic elevation of a dish that, instead, should be the simplest of reassuring nursery foods. Metaphorically and psychologically speaking, it is a stiff pat on the back from a confident, stylish New Yorker, when, deep down, what you really want is a soft, all-enveloping hug from mummy (AKA the mashed potato). There is some intermediate (con)fusion of the US-UK methods. Some people simmer the potatoes and other ingredients in stock until soft or layer the potatoes like a hotpot and, variously, oven bake them (and even cover the hash with cheese and grill it; this is not a shepherd\u2019s pie!). But, to be blunt, all those methods are wrong. This dish is a mashed potato-based meal. There is some suggestion that the basic, classic form of hash \u2013 fried onions, mash, chopped corned beef \u2013 is most prevalent in the north-west of England. If this is true, it confirms that region\u2019s leadership in this field. If you wish (it is a bit of a faff), you can cook then fry off the mash mixture in patties and break those up before serving \u2013 in order to build a little welcome crunch into the hash \u2013 but, at root, the corned beef hash should be a huge, soft hill that you can smoothly motor through with a spoon. Gravy Fundamentally, corned beef hash is all about the gravy. The gravy is the mighty meaty wave, the savoury tsunami, the rip current that should wash over and drown this otherwise bland dish in flavour. It should sweep you off your feet. Start with a butter, garlic, onion and beef stock base, and then freestyle with whatever you have to hand: old red wine, brown sauce, soy, Worcestershire sauce, to broaden and add 3D depth to that canvas. Heat A gentle tingle at the fringes of your hash is not unwelcome (tabasco, grain mustard etc), but cook it in as you fry your initial onions. That will take the edge of it. This is not a dish to enliven with fresh chillies or hot sauce. Both would clash horribly with the gravy. Any heat should shimmer in the distance, way behind the gravy\u2019s savoury thwack. A little spicy kick, a gentle underlying heat is fine, anything palpably chilli hot is not. Egg Yes, yes and thrice yes. Fried not poached, please. This is not a dish in which concern for your arteries should figure. Be in no doubt, we are troughing here. This is a meal that should immobilise you. Leave you bloated and beached. Clear your diary. But that egg is not mere gluttony, it makes culinary sense, too. The soft yolk adds a layer of richness and the texture of that fried white is a creamy counterpoint to the starchy potato. Vegetable, sides and garnishes Does corned beef hash need any? Arguably, no. Add a condiment [see, sauces], and you have a complete meal. However, there are certain vegetables that will bring a new mineral dimension to the dish. It is rather like putting a conservatory on a perfectly liveable suburban semi. It might be nice. But it is not essential. Good: Shredded, buttered cabbage, sprouts or other veg (eg broccoli) that offers a pointed iron-rich tang. A little scattered crispy bacon or crispy onions: both of which add a some textural va va voom and, respectively, complementary layers of salty or sweet flavour. Pickled red cabbage or beetroot; their vinegary sharpness is a kind of fastidious punctuation of this otherwise overly verbose, long-winded paragraph. Each brings definition and clarity to the dish, periodically clearing your palate (and mind) before the next meat \u2019n\u2019 potatoes assault. Bad: Peas, like carrots, are ineffectual in a corned beef hash, unless you add them by the bucket (turning it into a very different dish). The hint of sweetness they provide is too meek to assert itself. Fresh or fried bell peppers have no place in this dish \u2026 or in food generally (see also, oven-roasted tomatoes). Sweetcorn: no. Baked beans: is that middling, juvenile sweetness really sufficient yin to the yang of the hash? In HTE\u2019s opinion, it is not. Asparagus is probably the most overrated vegetable on Earth and, in a dish that you are going to tackle with a spoon and fork, is a logistical minefield. If you need to get a knife out to cut anything in a corned beef hash, you have failed at the dish. Creamed spinach (or any creamed vegetable) will make an unholy, murky mess of your gravy; think: Exxon Valdez-style pollution. The fallback of middling pub chefs and pretentious home cooks, this dish does not require any titivation with twee, tied bundles of chives or fronds of flat-leaf parsley. Neither adds anything to a hash, other than an unpleasant sense that someone has emptied their lawnmower over your tea. Bread: ordinarily, HTE is firmly in the bread-with-everything, carbs-on-carbs camp. But, c\u2019mon, this is an unusually filling meal. Serving it with buttered sourdough or soda bread is overkill. Sauces You will occasionally see people (Scandinavians, mostly), arguing that a hash should be served with a dollop of hollandaise or b\u00e9arnaise, but that seems an unnecessarily rich addition to such a gutsy dish. An egg yolk is as far as you should go down that path. Otherwise, stick to tomato sauce. Its piquant sweetness is just the pick-me-up, the periodic pep, you need when tackling this mountain range of meat and potatoes. Equipment Spoon, fork and a large, deep (to retain all that gravy) wide-rimmed bowl. That wide-rim is a useful ledge on which you can splodge your ketchup and then conveniently dip in-and-out of it, as you see fit. When There is a hardcore who regard hash as a hangover restorative, but, for HTE, it is too heavy for that role. This is not a dish to get you moving, but one that, on a filthy winter\u2019s night, after warming the marrow of your bones should lull you into a carb-coma such that you are pleasantly incapable of doing anything more strenuous than reaching for the remote control. Corned beef hash is your tea, not your dinner and \u2013 rare lazy brunches apart \u2013 certainly not a breakfast dish. Drink Nothing too fizzy: a glass of red, tea, water, a pale cask ale. You need all available stomach space. Taking on unnecessary carbon dioxide will only lead to indigestion. So, corned beef hash, how do you eat yours?",

I think it will have landslide success at the Baftas, but it is likely to do very well at the Globes. It is my favourite from this list, and Olivia Colman gives a great performance (see below). Having said this, the specious sugary unoriginality of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/21/mary-poppins-returns\">Mary Poppins Returns</a> could well beguile the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which presents the awards. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/13/crazy-rich-asians-review-jon-m-chu-constance-wu\">Crazy Rich Asians</a> was a very entertaining picture and it\u2019s certainly in with a shout.

The Favourite is a great film, and Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz are great in their supporting roles but it is surely all about Olivia Colman\u2019s toweringly mad star turn.

      "bodyText": "Best film (drama) The best dramas list for the Globes \u2013 to be presented on 6 January \u2013 contains something notable yet hardly noted. It puts African American-themed films in the majority: three out of five. Ryan Coogler\u2019s colossally successful Afrofuturist Marvel superhero movie Black Panther, Spike Lee\u2019s BlacKkKlansman and Barry Jenkins\u2019s James Baldwin adaptation If Beale Street Could Talk. All three are really substantial movies, though I think Lee\u2019s is tonally uncertain in a way that Jenkins\u2019s and Coogler\u2019s aren\u2019t. It could well be that Beale Street will win, and no one would quarrel with rewarding the artistry and moral seriousness of a film-maker such as Jenkins. Bohemian Rhapsody \u2013 the story of Freddie Mercury and Queen \u2013 is a surprise entry: thoroughly enjoyable but very much all about Rami Malek\u2019s bravura performance. But I have to say that Bradley Cooper\u2019s richly powerful and unashamedly emotional melodrama A Star Is Born gets my support \u2014 and I suspect that of Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) voters as well. Will win: A Star Is Born Should win: A Star Is Born Shoulda been a contender: Roma (sadly foreign-language films are ineligible for best drama at the Globes) Best film (musical or comedy) Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s The Favourite has dominated the critical conversation since its premiere at Venice this summer. I think it will have landslide success at the Baftas, but it is likely to do very well at the Globes. It is my favourite from this list, and Olivia Colman gives a great performance (see below). Having said this, the specious sugary unoriginality of Mary Poppins Returns could well beguile the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which presents the awards. Crazy Rich Asians was a very entertaining picture and it\u2019s certainly in with a shout. The arguably liberal-pious black/white balance of Green Book might mean that it is received with respect but not excitement. Adam McKay\u2019s Vice is the fifth film on the list: a very lively and well-acted movie about the former US vice president Dick Cheney. It has caused wrinkled critical noses here and there, and I am apparently in a minority in preferring it to his bafflingly overpraised previous film The Big Short. Will win: The Favourite Should win: The Favourite Shoulda been a contender: The Ballad of Buster Scruggs Best actor (drama) This is a slightly conservative selection, but the inclusion of Rami Malek\u2019s extravagant portrayal of Freddie Mercury is a shrewd move and my guess is that it will win (although gender politics is a point at issue here \u2013 singalong feelgood movies are acceptable when they are about men, but why don\u2019t the Mamma Mia! movies get the same breaks?) John David Washington\u2019s performance in BlacKkKlansman is impressive but the film\u2019s quasi-Brechtian alienations and comic cartoonery arguably mean that it is more difficult to engage with his character emotionally. Willem Dafoe\u2019s performance as Van Gogh in Julian Schnabel\u2019s At Eternity\u2019s Gate has all the integrity and self-possession you would expect, but it\u2019s a rather non-envelope-pushing film. Lucas Hedges (last seen in Kenneth Lonergan\u2019s Manchester By the Sea) stars in the gay conversion drama Boy Erased, but this might be a fish-in-a-barrel liberal issue film that will leave the HFPA unmoved. My feeling is still that Bradley Cooper\u2019s performance is the best. Will win: Rami Malek for Bohemian Rhapsody Should win: Bradley Cooper for A Star Is Born Shoulda been a contender: Ethan Hawke for First Reformed Best actress (drama) This has to be Glenn Close\u2019s year. I am almost at a hat-eating state of utter certainty about it. Her performance in The Wife is a fascinatingly subtle, complex and forthright portrayal that doesn\u2019t offer itself up all at once to the viewer: the story of the \u201cliterary wife\u201d, the spouse of the Nobel prize-winning novelist who has had to hide her own light under a bushel. Lady Gaga gives us an unexpected howitzer of a performance in A Star Is Born, but I think it doesn\u2019t quite match what Close is doing. Melissa McCarthy is a comic performer whose pathos in Can You Ever Forgive Me? has been much admired. Nicole Kidman and Rosamund Pike, in Destroyer and A Private War, are both offering a kind of movie machismo: roles in which their natural beauty is roughened up. Bold choices, certainly, but I think they are long shots. I very much missed Viola Davis on this list. Will win: Glenn Close for The Wife Should win: Glenn Close for The Wife Shoulda been a contender: Viola Davis for Widows Best actor (musical or comedy) The race is wide open here. It could be that industry sentimentality and nostalgia will gift this prize to Robert Redford for his farewell performance in The Old Man &amp; the Gun, but the truth is that his performance is a bit waxworky. In some ways, he\u2019s more of a lifetime-achievement candidate, but the Globes have already given him their Cecil B DeMille award in 1994. Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s Dick Van Dyke 2.0 performance in Mary Poppins Returns is forgettable and my feeling is that Viggo Mortensen\u2019s contribution to Green Book, though that of a very intelligent actor, will not capture the HFPA\u2019s imagination. Which leaves us with Christian Bale\u2019s very exhilarating and theatrical impersonation of Dick Cheney. I like that, but I admired John C Reilly\u2019s heartfelt portrayal of Oliver Hardy more. Really, Steve Coogan\u2019s Stan Laurel should be there alongside him. Will win: Christian Bale for Vice Should win: John C Reilly for Stan &amp; Ollie Shoulda been a contender: Steve Coogan for Stan &amp; Ollie Best actress (musical or comedy) Fifteen-year-old Elsie Fisher might actually pinch this one for her performance in the widely enthused-over Eighth Grade, and Charlize Theron is also a serious contender for her interesting turn in the flawed Tully, scripted by Diablo Cody and directed by Jason Reitman. For me, Emily Blunt is out of the running for her unrelaxed performance in Mary Poppins, which though studied and stylish, comes close to how Kate McKinnon would play the role in an SNL sketch. No, for me the frontrunner in both the Will win and Should win categories is the glorious performance from Olivia Colman: comic, and yet tragic, a portrayal of political tyranny and emotional victimhood. Will win: Olivia Colman for The Favourite Should win: Olivia Colman for The Favourite Shoulda been a contender: Aubrey Plaza for An Evening With Beverly Luff Linn Best supporting actor This list was notable for its absences. I have noted Brian Tyree Henry below, but there was also his Widows co-star Daniel Kaluuya, Tim Blake Nelson from The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, Sam Elliott from A Star Is Born and Jonathan Pryce from The Wife. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2019s performance in the father-son addiction memoir Beautiful Boy has been successful, but not in the league of his breakthrough in Call Me By Your Name; Adam Driver does solid but basically unexciting work in BlacKkKlansman; and Mahershala Ali commands respect in Green Book (and may get the prize). Sam Rockwell is amusing as Dubya in Vice, but he\u2019s really all about the latex. I have a good feeling about Richard E Grant as Jack Hock, the somewhat pathetic friend and enabler of Melissa McCarthy\u2019s literary forger in Can You Ever Forgive Me? It would be great to see Grant win a Globe. Will win: Richard E Grant for Can You Ever Forgive Me? Should win: Richard E Grant for Can You Ever Forgive Me? Shoulda been a contender: Brian Tyree Henry for Widows Best supporting actress This category is also wider open than first appears. The Favourite is a great film, and Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz are great in their supporting roles but it is surely all about Olivia Colman\u2019s toweringly mad star turn. Claire Foy does an honest job with the boring role of Neil Armstrong\u2019s wife in First Man (he\u2019s kind of boring, too, but he gets to go to the moon). The delicacy and intelligence of Regina King as Tish\u2019s mother in If Beale Street Could Talk is very impressive and I sense that she will inch it over Stone and Weisz, along with Amy Adams\u2019s serio-comic barnstormer as Dick Cheney\u2019s formidable wife, Lynne. I would have liked to see a posthumous award for the veteran Japanese actress Kirin Kiki who was wonderful in Hirokazu Kore-eda\u2019s Shoplifters. Will win: Regina King for If Beale Street Could Talk Should win: Regina King for If Beale Street Could Talk Shoulda been a contender: Kirin Kiki for Shoplifters Best director Here is the big prize, and again it\u2019s a mystery that Steve McQueen\u2019s masterly direction of his heist thriller Widows was not rewarded in this category. Adam McKay (Vice) and Peter Farrelly (Green Book) are, interestingly, comedy people who have moved away from comedy \u2013 though I won\u2019t say up from comedy. Spike Lee\u2019s direction of BlacKkKlansman was eye-catching and brilliant in many ways and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see him get this. But Roma, which was ineligible for best drama as it\u2019s in a foreign language, is a wonderful directing achievement for Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, and he really should get the award. However, Bradley Cooper\u2019s direction of A Star Is Born is resoundingly good and that might go down easier with the HFPA. Will win: Bradley Cooper for A Star Is Born Should win: Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n for Roma Shoulda been a contender: Steve McQueen for Widows Best screenplay This is another Globe that Cuar\u00f3n should get, perhaps to make up for the shame of not being nominated for best film \u2013 but Roma is a fascinatingly written movie, bearing the signs of having been crafted and developed over many years. Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara may well win for their scabrous, hilarious and very sweary script for The Favourite \u2013 clearly a labour of love. Adam McKay\u2019s wacky, self-aware script for Vice was amusing, although would have meant less without Bale\u2019s bravura performance. Again, this is a category where I was aware of the snubs. It would have been great to see Bart Layton rewarded here for American Animals, but I felt more intensely still the absence of Rupert Everett for his searing Oscar Wilde drama The Happy Prince. Will win: Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara for The Favourite Should win: Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n for Roma Shoulda been a contender: Rupert Everett for The Happy Prince. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 January 2019 to reflect the fact that Roma is ineligible for the best drama Globe as it\u2019s not in the English language",

      "body": "<p>Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and longtime consumer protection advocate, became the first Democratic candidate to formally enter the 2020 presidential race on Monday, with a New Year\u2019s Eve announcement that seemed timed to pre-empt the slew of candidacies from her fellow Democrats that are expected in the coming months.</p> <p>In a five-minute video, she stands in her kitchen and emphasizes the injustice of rising economic inequality, an issue she has focused her career on with an almost religious devotion. The Hillary Clinton comparisons followed immediately, with Politico asking just hours later: \u201cHow does Elizabeth Warren avoid a Clinton redux \u2013 written off as too unlikeable before her campaign gets off the ground?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/03/elizabeth-warren-likability-us-media-sexist-hillary-clinton\">Elizabeth Warren\u2019s \u2018likability\u2019? The US media has learned nothing from 2016 | Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The comparison to Clinton is an odd one, since there is considerable political daylight between the two women. Warren advocates for redistributive efforts far to the left of what Clinton campaigned for, even after her campaign was shifted into a more progressive position following the bruising 2016 primary fight against Bernie Sanders. Warren has called for an end to corporate personhood, has declared trickle-down economics \u201ca lie\u201d and has tentatively endorsed a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d. The two women can seem to have little in common besides a party affiliation and a haircut.</p> <p>The fact is that Elizabeth Warren <em>is</em> likable. She speaks frankly and in moral terms, avoiding the cajoling sliminess of politicians such as the reptilian Texas senator Ted Cruz, or her probable Democratic primary opponent, New Jersey senator Cory Booker. She is better at avoiding the air of professorial condescension that was sometimes indulged by her fellow former legal scholars Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. At times, she even achieves the unaffected folksiness that endears voters to politicians such as Beto O\u2019Rourke or Ronald Reagan. She has an air of kindly authority that might remind you of your old school teacher \u2013 probably because she used to be one.</p> <p>But none of this is what we mean when we ask whether or not Elizabeth Warren is \u201clikable\u201d, just as it was not what was meant when that tiresome question was asked about Clinton in the 2016 election cycle. Instead, the question of \u201clikability\u201d as it is applied to women candidates has become a kind of cipher through which pundits, strategists and ordinary Americans discuss our collective discomfort with women in power.</p> <p>The claim that a woman candidate is not \u201clikable\u201d is a code for saying she defies our shared cultural understanding that power and authority are implicitly male, and that women who claim them are illegitimate, threatening or breaking the rules. If it were possible for Warren to be \u201clikable\u201d, under this rubric, it would only be if she were able to adhere to prevailing ideas of what is appropriate behavior for her sex \u2013 that is, if she were not seeking public office at all.</p> <p>Of course, there are reasons for committed progressives to dislike Warren. She was a registered Republican in the early 1990s, and in the past she has made enthusiastic proclamations of the virtues of the free market, statements that are likely to strike the Democratic party\u2019s left wing as suspicious or naive. Troublingly, she recently made a stupid and unforced error when she took a DNA test to prove her Native American ancestry. The test was meant to dispel Donald Trump\u2019s accusation that Warren fabricated her heritage \u2013 her calls her \u201cPocahontas\u201d \u2013 in order to take advantage of affirmative action programs. It was a smear that was designed by the president to pique the racist enthusiasms of his base, and it worked.</p> <p>But by taking the test, Warren angered Native Americans, who have correctly argued that their culture is more than DNA, and she has made the rookie mistake of engaging with Trump on his own bad-faith terms. If she is to be successful against him in a general election, she will have to learn to deflect his attacks more intelligently, without playing into his hands.</p> <p>But the biggest obstacle to Warren\u2019s candidacy will be sexism, and not only from the trumped-up mobs of rightwingers who are sure to start chanting \u201cLock her up\u201d in reference to her at Trump\u2019s next rally. Misogyny is alive and well in the Democratic party; it knows no political affiliation. Much of the sexism that Warren will face will be from Republicans, but it will also come from Democratic voters \u2013 men and a few women who are liberals, leftists and progressives.</p> <p>Many of these voters are people who esteem themselves to be feminists or otherwise free of bias, but who will nevertheless find themselves uncomfortable with a woman in power, unable to articulate what it is that bothers them about Elizabeth Warren \u2013 except for a vague sense that they just don\u2019t like her.</p> <p>\u2022 Moira Donegan is a writer</p>",

      "bodyText": "Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and longtime consumer protection advocate, became the first Democratic candidate to formally enter the 2020 presidential race on Monday, with a New Year\u2019s Eve announcement that seemed timed to pre-empt the slew of candidacies from her fellow Democrats that are expected in the coming months. In a five-minute video, she stands in her kitchen and emphasizes the injustice of rising economic inequality, an issue she has focused her career on with an almost religious devotion. The Hillary Clinton comparisons followed immediately, with Politico asking just hours later: \u201cHow does Elizabeth Warren avoid a Clinton redux \u2013 written off as too unlikeable before her campaign gets off the ground?\u201d The comparison to Clinton is an odd one, since there is considerable political daylight between the two women. Warren advocates for redistributive efforts far to the left of what Clinton campaigned for, even after her campaign was shifted into a more progressive position following the bruising 2016 primary fight against Bernie Sanders. Warren has called for an end to corporate personhood, has declared trickle-down economics \u201ca lie\u201d and has tentatively endorsed a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d. The two women can seem to have little in common besides a party affiliation and a haircut. The fact is that Elizabeth Warren is likable. She speaks frankly and in moral terms, avoiding the cajoling sliminess of politicians such as the reptilian Texas senator Ted Cruz, or her probable Democratic primary opponent, New Jersey senator Cory Booker. She is better at avoiding the air of professorial condescension that was sometimes indulged by her fellow former legal scholars Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. At times, she even achieves the unaffected folksiness that endears voters to politicians such as Beto O\u2019Rourke or Ronald Reagan. She has an air of kindly authority that might remind you of your old school teacher \u2013 probably because she used to be one. But none of this is what we mean when we ask whether or not Elizabeth Warren is \u201clikable\u201d, just as it was not what was meant when that tiresome question was asked about Clinton in the 2016 election cycle. Instead, the question of \u201clikability\u201d as it is applied to women candidates has become a kind of cipher through which pundits, strategists and ordinary Americans discuss our collective discomfort with women in power. The claim that a woman candidate is not \u201clikable\u201d is a code for saying she defies our shared cultural understanding that power and authority are implicitly male, and that women who claim them are illegitimate, threatening or breaking the rules. If it were possible for Warren to be \u201clikable\u201d, under this rubric, it would only be if she were able to adhere to prevailing ideas of what is appropriate behavior for her sex \u2013 that is, if she were not seeking public office at all. Of course, there are reasons for committed progressives to dislike Warren. She was a registered Republican in the early 1990s, and in the past she has made enthusiastic proclamations of the virtues of the free market, statements that are likely to strike the Democratic party\u2019s left wing as suspicious or naive. Troublingly, she recently made a stupid and unforced error when she took a DNA test to prove her Native American ancestry. The test was meant to dispel Donald Trump\u2019s accusation that Warren fabricated her heritage \u2013 her calls her \u201cPocahontas\u201d \u2013 in order to take advantage of affirmative action programs. It was a smear that was designed by the president to pique the racist enthusiasms of his base, and it worked. But by taking the test, Warren angered Native Americans, who have correctly argued that their culture is more than DNA, and she has made the rookie mistake of engaging with Trump on his own bad-faith terms. If she is to be successful against him in a general election, she will have to learn to deflect his attacks more intelligently, without playing into his hands. But the biggest obstacle to Warren\u2019s candidacy will be sexism, and not only from the trumped-up mobs of rightwingers who are sure to start chanting \u201cLock her up\u201d in reference to her at Trump\u2019s next rally. Misogyny is alive and well in the Democratic party; it knows no political affiliation. Much of the sexism that Warren will face will be from Republicans, but it will also come from Democratic voters \u2013 men and a few women who are liberals, leftists and progressives. Many of these voters are people who esteem themselves to be feminists or otherwise free of bias, but who will nevertheless find themselves uncomfortable with a woman in power, unable to articulate what it is that bothers them about Elizabeth Warren \u2013 except for a vague sense that they just don\u2019t like her. \u2022 Moira Donegan is a writer",

A few ask if she is the woman from that Netflix show where she goes to Liguria, Italy, and tastes a sliver of pork fat as sweet as butter, or if she\u2019s the lady whose cookbook has those funky illustrations and the fold-out chart of cooking acids. Most just stare.</p> <p>Wherever she goes, at least in the US, chef and food writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/oct/04/messy-kitchens-and-badass-ladies-how-samin-nosrat-will-change-the-face-of-tv-cooking-shows\">Samin Nosrat</a> can\u2019t exist without people noticing her.</p> <p>\u201cDoes anybody like being recognized?\u201d she asks me. \u201cI understand that it\u2019s my job. I\u2019m grateful about people who are moved enough by the work to want to say something. But I mourn the loss of anonymity.\u201d</p> <p>Public recognition is a fact of celebrity life. But it\u2019s new for Nosrat, 38, whose life began to go topsy-turvy after the April 2017 release of her first cookbook, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Salt-Fat-Acid-Heat-Mastering/dp/1476753830\">Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat</a><em>, </em>a James Beard award-winning 480-page bible premised on the belief that the foolproof way to become a deft cook is to harness those four elements. The public attention only intensified after the October 2018 premiere of her Netflix docuseries based on the book in which she explores each element through food in Italy, Japan, Mexico and<strong> </strong>California. It was rhapsodically received by critics and audiences alike.</p> <p>She is also one of four Eat columnists at the New York Times Magazine, where she occasionally <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/magazine/pasta-tahdig-crispy-leftovers-main-course-noodles-persian-italian.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fmagazine-eat&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=magazine&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=15&amp;pgtype=collection\">uses</a> her recipe-focused <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/magazine/burger-american-muslim-kebab.html\">column</a> to offer ruminations on belonging in the US as a child of Iranian immigrants.</p> <p>As her star has risen, Nosrat has not had much time for herself: she barely cooks. She isn\u2019t home a lot. Her Berkeley, California, apartment, where she has lived for nine years, is a mess on a Friday in December when I visit her: dishes are stacked like Jenga blocks in her double kitchen sinks, two bulbs in her bedroom ceiling light don\u2019t work (one is \u201con purpose\u201d, to avoid too much brightness in the room, though she admits the other has been broken for two years).<strong> </strong>Later, I notice a fork in the cup holder of her Subaru<strong> </strong>beneath a pile of receipts.</p> <p>Nosrat has decided to carve out some time to be kind to herself, even when the world isn\u2019t. She has planned a visit to Chuck-E-Cheese\u2019s, the<strong> </strong>sweaty<strong> </strong>American citadel of frozen pizzas and arcade games whose mascot is an animatronic buck-toothed mouse<strong>, </strong>where she hasn\u2019t been since she was a kid.</p> <p>But before that, she wants to see a psychic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9638eb6ec76b3fd43577ce539713884e508febe9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9638eb6ec76b3fd43577ce539713884e508febe9/0_0_2200_1467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samin Nosrat meets with a psychic in Oakland, Calif.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samin Nosrat meets with a psychic in Oakland, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Hussin and Erin Brethauer/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first time Nosrat visited a psychic was in November 2013, just after her 33rd birthday, when she was feeling confused about where life was taking her. She had just sold the proposal for her cookbook that March. Though she had barely begun writing it, the psychic, Jessica Lanyadoo, predicted the book would become a film.</p> <p>Nosrat found this prophecy puzzling: a movie?</p> <p>\u201cI was like: \u2018Are you sure?<em>\u2019</em>\u201d Nosrat recalls, going over her black overalls with a lint roller from her bag.<em> \u201c</em>Don\u2019t you see a cooking show?\u201d</p> <p>Over the three years it took to finish her manuscript, Nosrat joked about Lanyadoo\u2019s prediction to herself, imagining who would play her in a film version (Maya Rudolph, she decided.) And then it came half-true, with Nosrat getting the Netflix show.</p> <p>\u201cEven if she\u2019s not telling me anything I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s an emotional, energetic validation of my own gut feelings,\u201d Nosrat says.</p> <p>We have agreed that I will only listen to the first 20 minutes of their conversation. She will decide later whether or not to share details of the rest of the reading with me. Once Nosrat sits down in Lanyadoo\u2019s backyard shed, chalked with astrological signs in the neighboring city of Oakland<strong>,</strong> it doesn\u2019t take long for the psychic, holding a stack of tarot cards, to sense the mild anxiety simmering beneath Nosrat\u2019s smile.</p> <p>\u201cSuccess comes with its own heart attack,\u201d Lanyadoo tells her. \u201cThe more you have, the more you have to lose.\u201d</p> <p>Nosrat nods, agreeing. \u201cIn every success, there is implicit sacrifice.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5707d3091b17ff01ad3865754af9f788bd282149\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5707d3091b17ff01ad3865754af9f788bd282149/0_0_2200_1467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samin Nosrat, a chef, food writer, and host of the Netflix docu-series Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat meets with Jessica Lanyadoo, a psychic that told Nosrat that she would have her own show five years ago, in Oakland, Calif. on Friday, December 14, 2018.

Those qualities translate beautifully to the screen, where her goofy grace is on full display. Some people wilt before the camera. Nosrat blossoms. (She stresses that going to therapy, which she has been attending since 2011, has helped her relax in front of the camera.)</p> <p>She projects the kind of charisma that fosters a sense of familiarity, allowing audiences to believe they know her. The downside of being this telegenic is strangers occasionally get too close. \u201cPeople feel really entitled to my time, to my attention, to my body,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Patrons flock to her immediately at Nyum Bai, a small Cambodian restaurant in Oakland she has been meaning to try. One woman she had met before but whose face she couldn\u2019t place calls Nosrat by her first name and speaks to her for nearly five minutes. A man Nosrat has never met asks to speak to her right after she has wrapped up her previous conversation, before she has had a chance to sit down. She can\u2019t walk a few paces without interruption. She\u2019s just trying to eat some Cambodian fried chicken.</p> <p>When Nosrat is finally able to sit, she piles <em>cha troup \u2013 </em>a jumble of ground pork, shrimp and blistered eggplants \u2013 on to her plate and<strong> </strong>recalls a time in her life when people didn\u2019t notice her. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing historically in my life very flashy,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not exceptionally beautiful.

Her older sister died of an aggressive brain tumor at age three, when Nosrat was one; she has twin brothers who are four years<strong> </strong>her junior. Though her family was middle-class, she went to school in the \u201crich, snobby part of San Diego\u201d, fighting a constant feeling of outsiderness in her youth.</p> <p>\u201cI was the one brown kid among all these rich, blond, pretty kids,\u201d she says. She pulls up a photograph on her phone from a high school pool party, where Nosrat, eyes and hair as dark as blackberries,<strong> </strong>is flanked by a gaggle of blondes. \u201cBlond, blonde, blonde, blonde, <em>me</em>.\u201d</p> <p>As she struggled with the same feeling of alienation in college at the University of California, Berkeley, she found an unexpected solace in food. It was May 1999 when she had her \u201cfateful dinner\u201d at Berkeley\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/13/how-alice-waters-changed-the-landscape-of-food-comment\">Chez Panisse</a>, an institution of California cuisine. What she ate that night was galaxies away from her Persian Maman\u2019s crispy saffron rice: halibut in broth. Guinea hen. For dessert, a chocolate souffl\u00e9, weightless as a sparrow\u2019s feather.</p> <p>The experience of fine dining was so foreign to her that she requested a glass of cold milk to complement the chocolate souffl\u00e9. \u201cHave you ever had a warm brownie or warm chocolate chip cookie? Milk is just the perfect companion!\u201d she chortles. \u201cI had no idea in fine dining that it\u2019s considered to be uncouth.\u201d</p> <p>The memory of that Chez Panisse meal lingered throughout her junior year abroad in London. When she returned in the fall of 2000 to finish her English degree, she wrote to Alice Waters, the restaurant\u2019s owner, and begged for a job bussing tables.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m always looking for people that are very hungry,\u201d Waters tells me. \u201cThat food is the passion. That they like to eat.\u201d Waters sensed this quality in Nosrat, whom she has <a href=\"https://www.nytco.com/press/nyt-mags-new-eat-columnist-samin-nosrat/\">christened</a> America\u2019s \u201cnext great cooking teacher\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s very open-minded,\u201d Waters says. \u201cShe\u2019s got such a <em>joie de vivre </em>of a cooking savvy she\u2019s communicating.\u201d</p> <p>Nosrat spent three weeks bussing tables at Chez Panisse before she started pestering the kitchen staff about joining them. It took nearly a year, and she found herself in an unpaid position, below the intern. But she observed cooks around her and, with careful intention, ascended to the paid position of <em>garde manger </em>after nine months of slogging through unpaid work. \u201cAt Chez Panisse, it\u2019s the person who accepts all the deliveries and makes all the staff meals and changes the ice under the fish,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a very non-glamorous job.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8eb3b3b5cea8e4c72cc892751429a967d7057e00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8eb3b3b5cea8e4c72cc892751429a967d7057e00/0_0_1000_1500/667.jpg\" alt=\"Samin Nosrat, a chef, food writer, and host of the Netflix docu-series Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat meets with Jessica Lanyadoo, a psychic that told Nosrat that she would have her own show five years ago, in Oakland, Calif. on Friday, December 14, 2018.

She sought a greater culinary education, beyond California, where she had been her whole life. \u201cTo me, the Italian food that we were cooking was always way more interesting than the French food,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Nosrat spent two years in Italy apprenticing under a Tuscan butcher and Florentine chef Benedetta Vitali (who appears in her Netflix show\u2019s first episode, which Nosrat confesses is her favorite). In 2004,<strong> </strong>at 24, she returned and began working at Eccolo, a restaurant opened by former Chez Panisse chef Christopher Lee, until it closed in 2009.</p> <p>\u201cWithin two years, I was running that kitchen,\u201d she says. \u201cI was a brown girl in charge of mostly white guys.\u201d</p> <p>But, mostly, she found that the kitchen staff didn\u2019t want to listen to her. \u201cI felt really frustrated that there didn\u2019t seem to be the respect I felt I deserved \u2013 it didn\u2019t just happen,\u201d she says. She admits she was moody and irritable in those years; she didn\u2019t yet have words to describe how unsettling the experience was.</p> <p>As she was coming to grips with the complicated dynamics of her new role, she made an important introduction that would begin her transition out of restaurant kitchens entirely.</p> <p>In November 2006, she<strong> </strong>passed a fan note to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/12/michael-pollan-reluctant-psychonanaut-psychedelic-drugs-how-to-change-your-mind\">Michael Pollan</a>, esteemed<strong> </strong>food journalist, author, and a then newly minted professor of journalism at UC Berkeley,<strong> </strong>via his server at Eccolo along with dessert. She asked to audit one of his classes in the spring of 2007.<strong> </strong>Everyone else in the class was a graduate student in journalism; Nosrat was a cook interested in food writing.</p> <p>\u201cShe held her own, more than held her own,\u201d Pollan says of Nosrat\u2019s performance in his class. In 2008, Nosrat began writing about food for local publications such as Edible San Francisco<em> </em>and, the next year, the San Francisco Chronicle<em>. </em>She and Pollan<strong> </strong>kept in touch sporadically over the next three<strong> </strong>years and in 2010, Pollan enlisted Nosrat to serve as his cooking teacher<strong> </strong>when he began writing 2013\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cooked-Natural-Transformation-Michael-Pollan/dp/0143125338\">Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI realized I had a wonderful cooking teacher right in town,\u201d he remembers. With regular visits over 18 months, Nosrat expanded his repertoire beyond grilled fish and chicken breasts. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to make a mirepoix or a proper braise or make a panna cotta,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Pollan also tapped Nosrat for an episode of his own Netflix series, Cooked,<em> </em>in 2016, in which she teaches him how to braise pork shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s a natural,\u201d says Pollan. \u201cSome people onscreen appear someone other than what they are.

      "bodyText": "Sometimes, they do a double take. Other times, their jaws drop. A few ask if she is the woman from that Netflix show where she goes to Liguria, Italy, and tastes a sliver of pork fat as sweet as butter, or if she\u2019s the lady whose cookbook has those funky illustrations and the fold-out chart of cooking acids. Most just stare. Wherever she goes, at least in the US, chef and food writer Samin Nosrat can\u2019t exist without people noticing her. \u201cDoes anybody like being recognized?\u201d she asks me. \u201cI understand that it\u2019s my job. I\u2019m grateful about people who are moved enough by the work to want to say something. But I mourn the loss of anonymity.\u201d Public recognition is a fact of celebrity life. But it\u2019s new for Nosrat, 38, whose life began to go topsy-turvy after the April 2017 release of her first cookbook, Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, a James Beard award-winning 480-page bible premised on the belief that the foolproof way to become a deft cook is to harness those four elements. The public attention only intensified after the October 2018 premiere of her Netflix docuseries based on the book in which she explores each element through food in Italy, Japan, Mexico and California. It was rhapsodically received by critics and audiences alike. She is also one of four Eat columnists at the New York Times Magazine, where she occasionally uses her recipe-focused column to offer ruminations on belonging in the US as a child of Iranian immigrants. As her star has risen, Nosrat has not had much time for herself: she barely cooks. She isn\u2019t home a lot. Her Berkeley, California, apartment, where she has lived for nine years, is a mess on a Friday in December when I visit her: dishes are stacked like Jenga blocks in her double kitchen sinks, two bulbs in her bedroom ceiling light don\u2019t work (one is \u201con purpose\u201d, to avoid too much brightness in the room, though she admits the other has been broken for two years). Later, I notice a fork in the cup holder of her Subaru beneath a pile of receipts. Nosrat has decided to carve out some time to be kind to herself, even when the world isn\u2019t. She has planned a visit to Chuck-E-Cheese\u2019s, the sweaty American citadel of frozen pizzas and arcade games whose mascot is an animatronic buck-toothed mouse, where she hasn\u2019t been since she was a kid. But before that, she wants to see a psychic. The first time Nosrat visited a psychic was in November 2013, just after her 33rd birthday, when she was feeling confused about where life was taking her. She had just sold the proposal for her cookbook that March. Though she had barely begun writing it, the psychic, Jessica Lanyadoo, predicted the book would become a film. Nosrat found this prophecy puzzling: a movie? \u201cI was like: \u2018Are you sure?\u2019\u201d Nosrat recalls, going over her black overalls with a lint roller from her bag. \u201cDon\u2019t you see a cooking show?\u201d Over the three years it took to finish her manuscript, Nosrat joked about Lanyadoo\u2019s prediction to herself, imagining who would play her in a film version (Maya Rudolph, she decided.) And then it came half-true, with Nosrat getting the Netflix show. \u201cEven if she\u2019s not telling me anything I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s an emotional, energetic validation of my own gut feelings,\u201d Nosrat says. We have agreed that I will only listen to the first 20 minutes of their conversation. She will decide later whether or not to share details of the rest of the reading with me. Once Nosrat sits down in Lanyadoo\u2019s backyard shed, chalked with astrological signs in the neighboring city of Oakland, it doesn\u2019t take long for the psychic, holding a stack of tarot cards, to sense the mild anxiety simmering beneath Nosrat\u2019s smile. \u201cSuccess comes with its own heart attack,\u201d Lanyadoo tells her. \u201cThe more you have, the more you have to lose.\u201d Nosrat nods, agreeing. \u201cIn every success, there is implicit sacrifice.\u201d Nosrat is kooky and endearing, with a laugh that makes a room vibrate and hugs that choke your breath. Those qualities translate beautifully to the screen, where her goofy grace is on full display. Some people wilt before the camera. Nosrat blossoms. (She stresses that going to therapy, which she has been attending since 2011, has helped her relax in front of the camera.) She projects the kind of charisma that fosters a sense of familiarity, allowing audiences to believe they know her. The downside of being this telegenic is strangers occasionally get too close. \u201cPeople feel really entitled to my time, to my attention, to my body,\u201d she says. Patrons flock to her immediately at Nyum Bai, a small Cambodian restaurant in Oakland she has been meaning to try. One woman she had met before but whose face she couldn\u2019t place calls Nosrat by her first name and speaks to her for nearly five minutes. A man Nosrat has never met asks to speak to her right after she has wrapped up her previous conversation, before she has had a chance to sit down. She can\u2019t walk a few paces without interruption. She\u2019s just trying to eat some Cambodian fried chicken. When Nosrat is finally able to sit, she piles cha troup \u2013 a jumble of ground pork, shrimp and blistered eggplants \u2013 on to her plate and recalls a time in her life when people didn\u2019t notice her. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing historically in my life very flashy,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not exceptionally beautiful. I\u2019m not exceptionally wealthy.\u201d She tells me where she comes from: born in San Diego in 1979, the year of the Iranian revolution, to parents who came to America from Iran in 1976. Her older sister died of an aggressive brain tumor at age three, when Nosrat was one; she has twin brothers who are four years her junior. Though her family was middle-class, she went to school in the \u201crich, snobby part of San Diego\u201d, fighting a constant feeling of outsiderness in her youth. \u201cI was the one brown kid among all these rich, blond, pretty kids,\u201d she says. She pulls up a photograph on her phone from a high school pool party, where Nosrat, eyes and hair as dark as blackberries, is flanked by a gaggle of blondes. \u201cBlond, blonde, blonde, blonde, me.\u201d As she struggled with the same feeling of alienation in college at the University of California, Berkeley, she found an unexpected solace in food. It was May 1999 when she had her \u201cfateful dinner\u201d at Berkeley\u2019s Chez Panisse, an institution of California cuisine. What she ate that night was galaxies away from her Persian Maman\u2019s crispy saffron rice: halibut in broth. Guinea hen. For dessert, a chocolate souffl\u00e9, weightless as a sparrow\u2019s feather. The experience of fine dining was so foreign to her that she requested a glass of cold milk to complement the chocolate souffl\u00e9. \u201cHave you ever had a warm brownie or warm chocolate chip cookie? Milk is just the perfect companion!\u201d she chortles. \u201cI had no idea in fine dining that it\u2019s considered to be uncouth.\u201d The memory of that Chez Panisse meal lingered throughout her junior year abroad in London. When she returned in the fall of 2000 to finish her English degree, she wrote to Alice Waters, the restaurant\u2019s owner, and begged for a job bussing tables. \u201cI\u2019m always looking for people that are very hungry,\u201d Waters tells me. \u201cThat food is the passion. That they like to eat.\u201d Waters sensed this quality in Nosrat, whom she has christened America\u2019s \u201cnext great cooking teacher\u201d. \u201cShe\u2019s very open-minded,\u201d Waters says. \u201cShe\u2019s got such a joie de vivre of a cooking savvy she\u2019s communicating.\u201d Nosrat spent three weeks bussing tables at Chez Panisse before she started pestering the kitchen staff about joining them. It took nearly a year, and she found herself in an unpaid position, below the intern. But she observed cooks around her and, with careful intention, ascended to the paid position of garde manger after nine months of slogging through unpaid work. \u201cAt Chez Panisse, it\u2019s the person who accepts all the deliveries and makes all the staff meals and changes the ice under the fish,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a very non-glamorous job.\u201d The work was grueling, but Nosrat\u2019s early years at Chez Panisse deepened her love for cooking. She sought a greater culinary education, beyond California, where she had been her whole life. \u201cTo me, the Italian food that we were cooking was always way more interesting than the French food,\u201d she says. Nosrat spent two years in Italy apprenticing under a Tuscan butcher and Florentine chef Benedetta Vitali (who appears in her Netflix show\u2019s first episode, which Nosrat confesses is her favorite). In 2004, at 24, she returned and began working at Eccolo, a restaurant opened by former Chez Panisse chef Christopher Lee, until it closed in 2009. \u201cWithin two years, I was running that kitchen,\u201d she says. \u201cI was a brown girl in charge of mostly white guys.\u201d But, mostly, she found that the kitchen staff didn\u2019t want to listen to her. \u201cI felt really frustrated that there didn\u2019t seem to be the respect I felt I deserved \u2013 it didn\u2019t just happen,\u201d she says. She admits she was moody and irritable in those years; she didn\u2019t yet have words to describe how unsettling the experience was. As she was coming to grips with the complicated dynamics of her new role, she made an important introduction that would begin her transition out of restaurant kitchens entirely. In November 2006, she passed a fan note to Michael Pollan, esteemed food journalist, author, and a then newly minted professor of journalism at UC Berkeley, via his server at Eccolo along with dessert. She asked to audit one of his classes in the spring of 2007. Everyone else in the class was a graduate student in journalism; Nosrat was a cook interested in food writing. \u201cShe held her own, more than held her own,\u201d Pollan says of Nosrat\u2019s performance in his class. In 2008, Nosrat began writing about food for local publications such as Edible San Francisco and, the next year, the San Francisco Chronicle. She and Pollan kept in touch sporadically over the next three years and in 2010, Pollan enlisted Nosrat to serve as his cooking teacher when he began writing 2013\u2019s Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation. \u201cI realized I had a wonderful cooking teacher right in town,\u201d he remembers. With regular visits over 18 months, Nosrat expanded his repertoire beyond grilled fish and chicken breasts. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to make a mirepoix or a proper braise or make a panna cotta,\u201d he says. Pollan also tapped Nosrat for an episode of his own Netflix series, Cooked, in 2016, in which she teaches him how to braise pork shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s a natural,\u201d says Pollan. \u201cSome people onscreen appear someone other than what they are. There\u2019s some quality of them that eludes the camera. That\u2019s not the case with Samin.\u201d Last year, Nosrat told a journalist she wanted to be the Iranian American Martha Stewart. I\u2019m wondering which kid in this Chuck-E-Cheese\u2019s is dreaming of becoming the next Samin Nosrat. Nosrat returned to this fixture of her childhood because she wanted to spend an afternoon not taking herself too seriously. \u201cSilliness and wackiness and clumsiness can disarm people, and are a beautiful way of balancing the more serious things I have to offer,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to teach you a complicated cooking thing or embark on this conversation about gender and race, but maybe you\u2019re more likely to trust me because I\u2019m more human and more like you.\u201d She admits she was also drawn to Chuck-E-Cheese\u2019s because it prompted her to think about her childhood: to remember the years when she was anonymous, though that was also a time when she felt like an outsider. And she is still an outsider in some respects, though it seems to work for her now \u2013 she has torched the tired rubric of the food and travel show, historically the domain of white men. There has been a lot written about Nosrat\u2019s differences since her show came out, particularly regarding to the representational ceilings she\u2019s shattered. She stopped reading most of what comes out about her after she encountered the first \u201cidentity piece\u201d concerned with the perceived radicalism of her \u201cotherness\u201d, just a month before we met. She woke up, panicking, thinking about the piece. \u201cI said: \u2018Uh-oh, this is gonna get really lonely really fast,\u2019\u201d she remembers.

Nosrat treats it like her wonderland. She plays air hockey against a toddler, and loses, graciously. She rides a glacially-paced merry-go-round. She crouches down on her knees and plays skee-ball. The jungle gym can\u2019t possibly be designed for anyone above 4ft, but Nosrat braves it anyway. It is the happiest I have seen her, that day or any other. Perhaps because only one person recognized her. Later that night, I ask Nosrat what the psychic said when I wasn\u2019t there.

      "bodyText": "It has been two years since Wells Fargo was embroiled in one of the biggest banking scandals in history. Under pressure to hit sales targets it was revealed that staff had created millions of fake bank accounts in order to hit their goals. Despite huge fines, a congressional mauling and public apologies, employees at the 166-year-old bank claim little has changed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like they\u2019ve changed much of anything, to be honest,\u201d Meggan Halvorson, a Wells Fargo private mortgage employee for six years, told the Guardian. \u201cThings put in place don\u2019t seem to be doing much of anything and we still hear complaints from customers.\u201d Since the scandal broke Wells Fargo has paid over $1.7bn in fines, $575m of that as late as December. Its executives have been grilled by Congress and the bank has promised \u201ca new day\u201d. And yet frontline bank workers, many of whom felt scapegoated during the fraudulent account scandal, are still mistreated, according to Halvorson. She said workers are still under intense pressure from middle management to get their bonuses, compensation lost from the reduction of financial incentives hadn\u2019t been replaced for frontline workers and sales teams still lean on workers to push through deal closings as quickly as possible. \u201cThere\u2019s no real respect for people\u2019s work-life balance,\u201d said Halvorson. \u201cThe overwhelming thing you hear from management is: \u2018Just be thankful you have a job.\u2019\u201d The bank has moved to address pay since the scandal and its decision to rethink the bonuses that led to the problem. In December 2017, Wells Fargo announced plans to increase their base minimum wage to $15 an hour, citing last year\u2019s $1.5tn tax cuts by the Trump administration, which largely favored corporations, as the incentive. The rise came before Wells Fargo announced plans to cut its workforce of 265,000 employees by 5-10% and reportedly sent hundreds of mortgage and call center jobs overseas. Workers are pushing to increase minimum wage to $20 an hour as Wells Fargo continues to post multibillion-dollar profits. Wells Fargo saved an estimated $3.7bn annually from Trump\u2019s tax cuts and has authorized $40.6bn in stock buybacks since the tax cut passed. A Wells Fargo representative cited a commitment to generating strong returns and capital to shareholders as the reason for the buybacks. In June 2018, Wells Fargo\u2019s chief executive officer, Tim Sloan, received a $4.6m raise, putting his annual total compensation at $17.6m, 564 times more than a full-time bank worker who makes $15 an hour. That wage rise came as the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren called on Wells Fargo to axe Sloan, arguing he was \u201cdeeply implicated in the bank\u2019s repeated and egregious misconduct\u201d. \u201cIn a lot of our cities right now $15 an hour isn\u2019t an adequate wage for people to live on.

      "body": "<p>It feels quaint \u2013 maybe a bit absurd \u2013 to remark the fact that Donald Trump has no constitutionally moral justification for his demand that Congress fund the building of a wall on the Mexican border. Such an argument feels absurd when made against this president. Yet it should not be insignificant to Congress.</p> <p>The president ran on a promise to build a wall \u201cpaid for by Mexico\u201d. No majority of Americans has ever voted to support that idea. But that idea is not the notion that is now shutting down the government. A wall paid for by taxpayers is. That wall certainly was a central issue in the 2018 midterm elections. Overwhelmingly, the public rejected it as well. Thus has the president earned public support for neither version of his Mexican wall.

      "bodyText": "It feels quaint \u2013 maybe a bit absurd \u2013 to remark the fact that Donald Trump has no constitutionally moral justification for his demand that Congress fund the building of a wall on the Mexican border. Such an argument feels absurd when made against this president. Yet it should not be insignificant to Congress. The president ran on a promise to build a wall \u201cpaid for by Mexico\u201d. No majority of Americans has ever voted to support that idea. But that idea is not the notion that is now shutting down the government. A wall paid for by taxpayers is. That wall certainly was a central issue in the 2018 midterm elections. Overwhelmingly, the public rejected it as well. Thus has the president earned public support for neither version of his Mexican wall. Yet he is using his veto power to demand that Americans pay for a wall before he will allow the government to reopen. The American constitution does not contemplate such presidential unilateralism, at least unsupported by the public\u2019s will or the constitution. Perhaps the most salient historical parallel is President Andrew Johnson\u2019s insistence that he had the constitutional right to control (and effectively stop) reconstruction after the civil war.

      "bodyText": "Kevin Hart, the comedian and actor who stepped down as Oscars host three days after his appointment was confirmed, now seems set to return to the post. In an hour-long interview on Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s chatshow, Hart said he was considering his options following a confused episode in which the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences reportedly asked him to apologise for past homophobic tweets and standup routines or to step down from the role. Hart stood down, claiming he had already apologised, but then offered an apology anyway. A month on, no new host has been announced. In DeGeneres, an openly gay two-times Oscars host held in huge public affection, Hart has a formidable champion. On the show, sections of which were released by DeGeneres ahead of the full broadcast on Monday, she says she has been in touch with the Academy to back Hart, that she suspects they hope he will return, and that she is \u201cpraying for that to happen\u201d. Should Hart return, she promises audiences would see \u201csophistication, class, hilarity and [Hart] growing as a person\u201d. Interviewer and interviewee concur that the chief problem lies not with Hart but with those who unearthed the tweets in question, from 2008, in the wake of his appointment. Hart describes this as \u201ca malicious attack on my character \u2026 an attack to end me\u201d. He continues: \u201cThis was to destroy me, to end all partnerships, all brand relationships, all investment opportunities, studio relationships, my production company and the people that work underneath me. \u201cThis was to damage the lives that have been invested in me. It\u2019s bigger than just the Oscars, it\u2019s about the individuals that are out there now that are finding success and damaging your \u2018celebrity\u2019.\u201d Hart\u2019s homophobic remarks on Twitter included calling someone a \u201cfat faced fag\u201d, comparing a profile picture to a \u201cgay bill board for AIDS\u201d and frequent self-declarations as \u201cno homo\u201d. One 2010 standup routine includes an extended riff in which Hart discusses trying to drum any hint of homosexuality out of his son. Many declared their distaste at Hart\u2019s initial comments and what they saw as a lukewarm show of contrition. Speaking to the Guardian about the incident, Steve McQueen \u2013 whose film 12 Years a Slave won the best picture Oscar in 2014 \u2013 said he thought Hart\u2019s appointment had been made with an eye on falling telecast viewing figures, \u201cbut obviously somebody made a mistake\u201d. On her show, DeGeneres tells Hart that \u201cthere are so many haters out there\u201d and urges him to \u201cbe the bigger man\u201d. She goes on: \u201cIt\u2019s a small group of people being very, very loud. We are a huge group of people who love you and want to see you host the Oscars.\u201d Hart indicates he would be eager to consider returning to what he has previously described as his \u201cdream job\u201d on crusading grounds: \u201cSomebody has to take a stand against the trolls.\u201d Some Twitter users have taken issue with Hart and DeGeneres\u2019s version of events, maintaining that the former\u2019s apology remains half-hearted, and that the latter was speaking out of turn \u2013 or even betraying the gay community. A survey conducted at the end of 2018 by Spotted, a data and research provider focused on the celebrity endorsement space, suggested that the furore had barely dinted Hart\u2019s appeal. The company\u2019s \u201cconsumer approval\u201d metric, which measures likability, relatability and trustworthiness among US consumers, measured a nearly 50% rebound following Hart\u2019s apology. More striking was that his initial fall was so negligible: just an 11.55% drop in popularity after the controversy erupted. The Spotted CEO, Janet Comenos, said Hart remained in the top 5% of celebrity talent in terms of consumer approval. \u201cKevin Hart has an uncanny ability to recover from scandal,\u201d she said. \u201cHis ability to quickly rebound is directly correlated to how high he scores, pre-scandal. When a celebrity is so well-liked in the eyes of consumers, just like a mother\u2019s favourite child, they can almost do no wrong.\u201d Hart was booked to appear on Ellen to promote The Upside, a remake of French hit The Intouchables. Hart plays a drifter recently released from prison who becomes the carer of a paralysed billionaire (played by Bryan Cranston).",

      "bodyText": "British nationals settled in Italy have landed a new year Brexit break after the Italian government announced they would remain legal residents of the country in the event of no deal. High level officials from the Ministero degli Affari Esteri told volunteers in the British in Italy campaign group that they \u201cwould continue to be legally resident with their existing rights to work\u201d if Theresa May does not get her withdrawal agreement ratified and the UK crashes out of the EU on 29 March. \u201cOur worst fears are over. This makes Italy the first EU27 country to publicly declare their plans for citizens\u2019 rights post-Brexit, and to provide the reassurance we have been awaiting so long,\u201d said the group in a statement. The Italian breakthrough comes days after immigration officials in Berlin vowed to open an urgent registration process to secure legal status will be in place for them in the event of the UK leaving the EU with no deal. The Berlin authorities delivered their promise quickly opening the registration process on Thursday 3 January, and telling worried Britons that if there was no deal they would be briefly exempt from German law requiring residency documentation. \u201cFrom 30.03.2019 onwards British citizens in Germany will, for an initial period of three months until 30.06.2019, be exempted from the requirement to possess a German residency title,\u201d they said on their website. Before Christmas the French also sought to reassure British nationals in France of their status post-Brexit. Nathalie Loiseau, the Europe minister, said that France would guarantee the residence, employment and welfare rights of the 160,000 resident British citizens living there provided that Britain offered the same guarantees to French expatriates. There are an estimated 60,000 British nationals living and working in Italy who were concerned at the prospect of becoming \u201cirregular\u201d with no rights to reside, work, or access national healthcare or social security if there was no deal. While British in Italy says they feel reassured that they will not now be illegal, they are concerned that they lose some of their rights including the freedom to move to another EU country or work or offer services in another EU country. This is because negotiations on these rights were set aside, to be discussed at the next Brexit phase of talks on the future relationship between the EU and the UK. \u201cI feel a mixture of extreme relief that whatever happens with Brexit we will be able to continue to live legally in our adopted home, but this is coupled with a great anger that I and so many others have been left in this situation for so long when it could have been settled on 27 June 2016,\u201d said Denise Abel, member of British in Italy. But she added: \u201cI thank the Italian government from the bottom of my heart for doing what was promised to us, making it possible for us to continue to live our lives as before. The situation is not perfect for those of us who rely on freedom of movement for our work but at least we Brits in Italy can sleep better in our beds knowing we will not become illegal in our own homes.\u201d A fellow member of the campaign group, Carole-Anne Richards, said she had \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about the news but her immediate feeling was \u201cone of relief\u201d that she won\u2019t be illegal. \u201cAt the end of the day the UK government has not ensured my rights will be the same as promised \u2013 they will be significantly diminished,\u201d she said. The absence of freedom of movement affects Britons who work in multiple EU countries and has lead to accusations that the EU and May are leaving them \u201clandlocked\u201d. According to one of the representative of British in Italy, the Italian state representatives assured them \u201cthey are working on legislation that will be in place by 29 March, so in the event of no deal we will all be legally resident and entitled work and continue with our existing rights now, as they are now\u201d. They said they are hoping to replicate the rights Britons have had under Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement if that is ratified. This will mean British nationals can continue to live and work in the country, but they will still be without some of their rights including the freedom of movement to live or work in another EU country, or the ability to offer services in another country. British in Europe, the coalition of campaign groups for Britons facing the loss of rights because of Brexit, have accused the UK of abandoning an estimated 1 million Britons who would be left high and dry if the UK crashes out of the block. Theresa May and the EU have called on EU member states to be \u201cgenerous\u201d and to ensure Britons\u2019 rights are protected, but there is underlying anger that in 2017 the EU offered to roll over 100% of rights to all those individuals in the UK and the continent affected by Brexit. The UK did not respond to this offer and instead came up with its own version of immigration rules for EU citizens in the UK forcing the EU to negotiate on these terms.",

Celebrities are making a cause of it. Men in offices are advised to say \u201cmenopause\u201d three times a day to develop empathy for female co-workers. Hot flushes and night sweats are discussed in newspapers. But the worst symptom is never mentioned: there\u2019s a post-menopausal elephant in the bedroom and its name is Dry Vagina.</p> <p>Dear younger women, do not underestimate this. I breezed through all other aspects of the menopause. Hot flushes? Wear layers. Night sweats? Drink water. But a desiccating vagina? A person can apply only so much lubrication.

      "bodyText": "Whenever I hear about a couple over a certain age enjoying an active sex life, I marvel about one aspect that is never talked about. The menopause is now a \u201cwoke\u201d topic. Celebrities are making a cause of it. Men in offices are advised to say \u201cmenopause\u201d three times a day to develop empathy for female co-workers. Hot flushes and night sweats are discussed in newspapers. But the worst symptom is never mentioned: there\u2019s a post-menopausal elephant in the bedroom and its name is Dry Vagina. Dear younger women, do not underestimate this. I breezed through all other aspects of the menopause. Hot flushes? Wear layers. Night sweats? Drink water. But a desiccating vagina? A person can apply only so much lubrication. Even then, penetration is excruciating, second only to the stinging afterwards when you need to urinate and have to steel yourself not to cry out loud. So, what are all those other post-menopausal, sexually active women doing? Have they miraculously escaped? I like sex. My husband likes sex. I don\u2019t want to give it up. But I now dread the final moments. I didn\u2019t want to tell my husband, and make him feel anxious and guilty. It\u2019s not his fault.

Gitonga said that the county\u2019s efforts to tackle FGM were welcome, but added: \u201cWe need a different strategy ensuring we respect the girls\u2019 right to privacy and also that we have a clear plan of what we do with the information. \u201cWhen we find out that a girl has gone through FGM, what will be the consequences? Will there be psycho-social support? Or does this mean that she will be denied permission to go to school?\u201d Mandatory examinations risked further victimising girls who have experienced abuse, warned Gitonga. All forms of FGM were criminalised in Kenya in 2011, as was discrimination against of women who have not undergone the procedure. Failing to report a case to the authorities was also made unlawful, together with aiding the performance of FGM or taking a Kenyan woman abroad to perform the procedure. The practice is becoming less prevalent across the country, where one in five women and girls aged 15 to 49 have undergone FGM. Campaigners say tackling FGM is crucial to stopping teenage pregnancies and child marriage. \u201cFor girls who have undergone FGM, the community believes that those girls become a woman. Therefore every other violation that happens at that point happens [after] the FGM,\u201d said Gitonga. \u201cIf they are having sex even with older men the community does not recognise it as defilement.\u201d In Narok, four in 10 girls become pregnant as teenagers, according to Kenya\u2019s most recent demographic and health survey, produced in 2014. Efforts to reduce teen pregnancies will fail unless gender-based violence and poverty are addressed, added Gitonga. \u201cFor girls living in informal settlements, it is very hard; there is a risk of sexual violence. Sometimes they have to do sex work to help with educating their siblings. So you need to understand their situation,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just punish people for getting pregnant.\u201d",

You will either revel in its sparse, non-luxurious simplicity, the cheap tables, the Ikea glasses and the hollow acoustics. Or you may feel as if you\u2019re in the dining room of a last-minute two-star Costa Brava hotel that you booked half-board but by day three are loth to eat in. The path to your table takes you past a glass-fronted workspace filled with dumpling technicians, all wearing surgical masks and white laboratory coats, standing in groups of five, and filling, weighing and primping xiao long bao, shumai, jiaozi and so on. Sporadically, one of these white-coated, faceless and almost inaudible workers will totter, Pingu-style, to your table laden with a stack of baskets. This is either charming, or a bit like feeding time at a medical trials centre you signed up for to settle your gambling debts.</p> <p>We ordered the classic pork bao, in delicate, accomplished, neatly pinched dough with 18 tiny puckers. To taste, they\u2019re pleasantly inoffensive, neither obscenely soupy nor intensely flavoured. We took the pale green, vegetarian jiaozi, which are pretty to look at and filled with brown, umami-flavoured mulch. A side of black, waxy, soy-drenched wood-ear mushrooms with ginger in vinegar were peculiar yet compelling.</p> <p>We wanted the prawn and angled gourd, but there was none. We wanted crispy wonton, but there was none of that, either. Almost everything fried on the menu was unavailable, as were all the desserts \u2013 the sweet steamed buns filled with red taro or chocolate lava, or any of the jellies, rice or mango puddings. This, I mused, might be a handy thing for one of the managers, of which there are about 17, to go and tell the people queueing for five hours outside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb65a9d3031dc26bcd5e5a314ff5ea52d84c5a9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb65a9d3031dc26bcd5e5a314ff5ea52d84c5a9d/709_497_4721_2833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Din Tai Fung Restaurant, Covent Garden, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Din Tai Fung, London WC2: \u2018Dumpling technicians in surgical masks and white lab coats.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here is the rub about hype: there would be nothing at all wrong with Din Tai Fung if you popped in one day, unbesmirched by pre-bluster and expecting nothing. In that case, you\u2019d slurp the dumplings, make a crisp, delicious golden prawn pancake disappear and perhaps a bowl of wobbly wontons in chilli oil, maybe even some bland, white noodles in a puddle of spicy sauce, and leave feeling pleasantly sated. You would observe the aesthetically splendid bowl of prawn and egg fried rice with some gratitude for your lot as a fed, watered, sheltered human being. But, no, you were caught up in hype, so now you can\u2019t accept anything less than being shot in a rocket to the Cantina bar in Star Wars, where the dumplings are served by magical unicorns that lick the oldness off your face between plates, leaving you more youthful by the time the bill arrives. Anything less than that is a letdown.</p> <p>I will return for my pudding when the hype fades, the influencers get bored and the buzz moves on in no more than 12 weeks.

The path to your table takes you past a glass-fronted workspace filled with dumpling technicians, all wearing surgical masks and white laboratory coats, standing in groups of five, and filling, weighing and primping xiao long bao, shumai, jiaozi and so on. Sporadically, one of these white-coated, faceless and almost inaudible workers will totter, Pingu-style, to your table laden with a stack of baskets. This is either charming, or a bit like feeding time at a medical trials centre you signed up for to settle your gambling debts. We ordered the classic pork bao, in delicate, accomplished, neatly pinched dough with 18 tiny puckers. To taste, they\u2019re pleasantly inoffensive, neither obscenely soupy nor intensely flavoured. We took the pale green, vegetarian jiaozi, which are pretty to look at and filled with brown, umami-flavoured mulch. A side of black, waxy, soy-drenched wood-ear mushrooms with ginger in vinegar were peculiar yet compelling. We wanted the prawn and angled gourd, but there was none. We wanted crispy wonton, but there was none of that, either. Almost everything fried on the menu was unavailable, as were all the desserts \u2013 the sweet steamed buns filled with red taro or chocolate lava, or any of the jellies, rice or mango puddings. This, I mused, might be a handy thing for one of the managers, of which there are about 17, to go and tell the people queueing for five hours outside. Here is the rub about hype: there would be nothing at all wrong with Din Tai Fung if you popped in one day, unbesmirched by pre-bluster and expecting nothing. In that case, you\u2019d slurp the dumplings, make a crisp, delicious golden prawn pancake disappear and perhaps a bowl of wobbly wontons in chilli oil, maybe even some bland, white noodles in a puddle of spicy sauce, and leave feeling pleasantly sated. You would observe the aesthetically splendid bowl of prawn and egg fried rice with some gratitude for your lot as a fed, watered, sheltered human being. But, no, you were caught up in hype, so now you can\u2019t accept anything less than being shot in a rocket to the Cantina bar in Star Wars, where the dumplings are served by magical unicorns that lick the oldness off your face between plates, leaving you more youthful by the time the bill arrives. Anything less than that is a letdown. I will return for my pudding when the hype fades, the influencers get bored and the buzz moves on in no more than 12 weeks. Trends come and go, but fickleness never goes out of fashion. \u2022 Din Tai Fung 5-6 Henrietta Street, London WC2, 020-3034 3888. Open all week, 11am-10.30pm (10pm Sun).

      "body": "<p>In 1999, crowds of art lovers, many of them baffled, filed into London\u2019s Tate gallery to view <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/16/tracey-emin-artist-1998-installation-my-bed-tate-liverpool-merseyside\" title=\"\"><em>My Bed</em></a>, a work quickly established as one of the most iconic and notorious of our age. Tracey Emin\u2019s installation painstakingly recreated her bed as it appeared after an alcohol-fuelled breakdown, triggered by the end of a relationship. A disordered tangle of used and dirty stockings, towels and sheets, the undersheet spilling freely over the bed\u2019s base, was bordered by the accumulated debris of an exhausted life. This was not a bed of peaceful rest, airy dreams or frenzied coupling, but of illness, exhaustion and despair. The intoxicants and condoms strewn around conveyed not a lively appetite, but a quest for physical and psychic numbness, plunging us into a state the French sociologist Alain Ehrenberg called \u201cweariness of the self\u201d.</p> <p>Ehrenberg diagnosed this weariness as the essential malaise of our time. He described a chronic incapacity arising from a state of perpetual work \u2013 not only the long hours spent in waged employment, but the state of permanent busyness induced by daily demands to act and consume. This has been accentuated, since Ehrenberg published his book, by the 24/7 imperatives of online life: follow, like, update, upload, link and (of course) buy.</p> <p>This culture induces an intense yearning for the state of rest it denies us. Driven by a spirit of anxiously competitive workaholism, or by the simple need to survive, millions of men and women spend a vast proportion of their lives at work. Advertisements for energy drinks and flu remedies promise to power through illness and exhaustion and spare us (and our employers) a day off. And as work is proclaimed as high value, non-work is loudly condemned \u2013 in shrill tabloid fantasies of welfare scroungers and migrants enjoying easy lives at our expense, in the drive of western governments both left and right of centre to ensure we remain in work, in the withholding and denial of disabled welfare benefits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"53adbc1a6911f1758f6b3dbe643599aec15b26b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53adbc1a6911f1758f6b3dbe643599aec15b26b1/0_0_1581_2283/693.jpg\" alt=\"My Year of Rest and Relaxation by Ottessa Moshfegh\" width=\"693\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In my daily work as a psychoanalyst, this atmosphere of enforced, anxious overactivity pervades my consulting room.

Sifting through these voices, we can discern four broad and frequently recurrent character types: the burnout, derailed from his blind impulsion to act and achieve by a sudden, overwhelming need to stop, to which he can only blankly surrender; the slob, who turns lassitude, gluttony and indifference to self and world into an elective way of life; the daydreamer, who eludes the burdens of daily life by taking off into the far reaches of the imagination; and the slacker, who turns an aversion to the real world and its demands into a concrete ethos and lifestyle. In these figures, we can make out currents of resistance, both brash and subtle, to the rule of blind, incessant activity.</p> <p>There are few more powerfully concentrated images of the burnout than the absent occupant of Emin\u2019s bed. But if <em>My Bed</em> could be said to have a fictional analogue, I suggest we\u2019d find it in Ottessa Moshfegh\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/11/my-year-rest-relaxation-ottessa-moshfegh-review\" title=\"\"><em>My Year of Rest and Relaxation</em></a>, published last year.</p> <p>Moshfegh\u2019s unnamed narrator, a woman in her early 20s whose parents have died, is already weary of the dubious, too easily available enticements of art, sex and money. She resolves to self-induce a year-long sleep, punctuated only by short waking intervals to feed herself. She is, to recall Ehrenberg, weary of the self, investing all her energy and ingenuity in a scheme to reduce her bodily and mental agitation to near zero. Even before this experiment in self-annulment, she has started \u201chibernating\u201d, downing sleeping pills, letting her muscles waste and watching vapid movies on VHS: \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand to watch regular television. Especially at the beginning, TV aroused too much in me, and I\u2019d get compulsive about the remote, clicking around, scoffing at everything and agitating myself.\u201d</p> <p>Moshfegh\u2019s narrator recalls an earlier fictional shut-in: Jean Des Esseintes, the protagonist of Joris-Karl Huysman\u2019s cult 1884 novel <em>\u00c0 Rebours</em>, or <em>Against Nature</em>. Des Esseintes\u2019s tragicomic trials centre on his desperate attempts to return his body and mind, ravaged by sexual and narcotic debauchery, to a state of undisturbed peace. He leaves the fleshpots of Paris for his quiet villa in the suburbs, where he tries and fails to forge a life of monastic abstemiousness.</p> <p>These characters are caught in a tormenting predicament: however hard they try to sink into oblivion, they cannot help feeling the scratch of worldly demands and desires, giving rise to a state of heightened enervation that ruins both work and relaxation. This is the state of burnout, a term first used in a diagnostic sense by the German-American psychologist Herbert J Freudenberger in 1974, to refer to the growing phenomenon of \u201cphysical or mental collapse caused by overwork or stress\u201d.</p> <p>Freudenberger found burnt-out workers running on empty, depleted of all but the most minimal internal resources. Their exhaustion led to an intense longing for a state of rest, alongside the sense that it can\u2019t be attained, that some anxiety or distraction won\u2019t let them go. The human organism, it seems, is not hospitable to the zero state, however much it might desire it.</p> <p>Burning out involves a distressingly long and arduous route to the state of inactivity, which is then spoiled by nervousness, shame and guilt. The scandalous courage of the slob, in contrast, is to embrace the inertial state and openly reject diligence and responsibility.</p> <p>Freud often pointed to the erect posture as the definitive evolutionary achievement of the human being. Straightening our backs and tilting our chins up towards the firmament, we freed our heads from the disgusting and arousing smells of our intimate bodily selves, acquiring the dignity, order and discipline of form. The slob disturbs us because he puts us in touch with that formless, muddy region of the self we thought we\u2019d risen above. We feel it when we sink exhausted into the sofa, abandoning ourselves to gravity\u2019s downward pull. We feel it when our minds yield to the sludgy undertow of blank stupidity, when all our inner voice can do is hum moronic advertising jingles.</p> <p>No wonder the slob became the bete noire of Enlightenment thinking; inducing numbness and apathy, laziness undoes its cherished ideals of autonomy and moral responsibility. The most celebrated and ambiguous instance of this hostility to laziness is found in Denis Diderot\u2019s <em>Rameau\u2019s Nephew</em>, a fictionalised dialogue with a notorious Parisian music tutor and society freeloader, posthumously published in 1805. Their discussion in a cafe quickly turns to the difficulties of Rameau, who supports his family by sponging off the wealthy \u2013 they tend to eject him soon after his amusement value has been exhausted. Diderot listens to his defence of his amoral, self-indulgent and thoroughly useless life with a show of outward disgust, leavened by a surreptitious amusement, even secret admiration.</p> <p>Diderot\u2019s case for self-reliance and honesty is oddly flat next to Rameau\u2019s seductive advocacy of slobbish abandon: \u201cDrink good wine, blow yourself out with luscious food, have a tumble with lovely women, lie on soft beds.\u201d The book puts us in touch with the Rameau concealed in us all, the big entitled baby who rails against the obstacles reality puts in the way of his contentment, who doesn\u2019t see why he should be asked to work and be responsible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e57614cbe42a705e80f2ac29081fddf98af15689\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e57614cbe42a705e80f2ac29081fddf98af15689/0_0_1300_879/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Linklater\u2019s 1991 Slacker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was rescued, not for the first time in my life, by a movie.\u2019 Richard Linklater\u2019s 1991 <em>Slacker.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Let other people do it all so I don\u2019t have to \u2013 Rameau\u2019s watchword is also that of a more familiar and contemporary folk-heroic slob: Homer Simpson. Homer is a pop-cultural incarnation of what the French writer Georges Bataille called the spirit of \u201cpure expenditure\u201d: he wants what he wants right now, in limitless quantities. Homer and his friends are lazy slobs, for whom the will to consume always trumps the obligation to produce. The lurid glow of warm colour suffusing <em>The Simpsons</em> is a kind of atmospheric analogue to the nirvana of inanity induced by the abundance of Duff Beer and Lard Lad Donuts. Homer, like Snoopy, Garfield or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/20/the-big-lebowski-review-the-dude-jeff-bridges-coen-brothers\" title=\"\">Jeffrey \u201cThe Dude\u201d Lebowski</a>, played by Jeff Bridges, is the vicarious channel for the life of aimless sloth many of us would secretly like to live and have been forced to renounce.</p> <p>The slob resists the world\u2019s demands by succumbing to the downward pull of gravity. The daydreamer does so by refusing it, by floating airily above her daily reality. Daydreaming is a refusal to equate life with quotidian existence.</p> <p>Why would anyone want to retreat into the clouds and abandon the urgent claims of life here below? In one of his scandalous inversions of received wisdom, Oscar Wilde suggested that action was the real refuge of \u201cpeople who have nothing whatsoever to do\u201d. \u201cTo do nothing at all,\u201d he adds, \u201cis the most difficult thing in the world,\u201d because it deprives us of the easy evasions of busyness and purpose. Should we doubt this, we need only glance around a cafe, tube carriage or family dinner table and observe the reflexive flight of the eyes and hands around us into the anxious distractions of emails, box sets and Candy Crush.</p> <p>Occasionally, someone comes along and makes us question the superiority of action over contemplation. Take Emily Dickinson, who spent the largest part of her adult life locked in her Amherst bedroom, scratching out nearly 2,000 poems. She opens poem 657 with this provocative declaration: \u201cI dwell in Possibility \u2013 / A fairer House than Prose \u2013 / More numerous of Windows \u2013 / Superior \u2013 for Doors \u2013\u201d. Bound up with this dreamy reclusion is Dickinson\u2019s refusal of marriage, even to the man she was evidently in love with. Withdrawn into the quiet repose of her locked room, \u201cdoing nothing\u201d, she can venture infinitely further and more boldly than a woman bounded by the obligations and conventions of 19th century marriage.</p> <p>The first year of my PhD was a time of increasing anxiety and depressive drift. The illusion of complete daily freedom was fun only for as long as I could forget that I was supposed to be doing something. The growing pile of books and scholarly journals induced in me not productive urgency but debilitating paralysis. I was rescued, not for the first time in my life, by a movie: Richard Linklater\u2019s 1991 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1992/dec/03/1\" title=\"\"><em>Slacker</em></a>, which I watched enraptured in the back row seat of a sticky floored fleapit.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t take me long to see the aimlessness of my own life reflected in the funhouse mirror of Linklater\u2019s film, comprised of weird, randomly connected episodes from the makeshift subcultures of Austin, Texas, teeming with amateur metaphysicians, tinkerers, petty criminals, anarchists and poseurs, linked only by their uncompromising renunciation of \u201cthe kind of work you have to do to earn a living\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/21/attention-dispatches-from-a-land-of-distraction-by-joshua-cohen-book-review\">Attention: Dispatches from a Land of Distraction by Joshua Cohen \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The film\u2019s title seemed to allude less to its characters than to itself, to its own slack relationship to its subjects, at once fascinated and distracted, alive and lackadaisical. Watching <em>Slacker</em> opened up a different way of relating to my own life, one that wasn\u2019t measured and valued by externally imposed targets and achievements. It offered a glimpse of what Roland Barthes called \u201cidiorrhythmy\u201d, \u201cwhere each subject lives according to his own rhythm\u201d. To live life as a slacker means to refuse the regimentation of time and space by the impersonal forces of work and leisure, giving yourself over to the pace and style of the impulses, curiosities and desires unique to you. But it\u2019s equally a social ideal, whereby the rhythms of all our individual lives co-exist without encroaching on each other.</p> <p>No doubt there comes a time when your idiorrhythm can no longer be isolated from everyone else\u2019s, when it must reckon with the externally imposed rhythms of an institutional day or the competing idiorrhythms of lovers or children or pets. But surely this is when it\u2019s most important to keep hold of its spirit of indiscipline, its commitment to activity, and inactivity, without purpose or aim.</p> <p>Perhaps all of us, not least the good citizens and hard workers, have much to learn from the slacker and her counterparts. If we allow our whole selves to be absorbed by the demands and agendas of a persecutory to-do list scribbled by others, we will quickly lose the very dimension of life that makes it worth living.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Not Working by Josh Cohen is published by Granta.

There are few more powerfully concentrated images of the burnout than the absent occupant of Emin\u2019s bed. But if My Bed could be said to have a fictional analogue, I suggest we\u2019d find it in Ottessa Moshfegh\u2019s My Year of Rest and Relaxation, published last year. Moshfegh\u2019s unnamed narrator, a woman in her early 20s whose parents have died, is already weary of the dubious, too easily available enticements of art, sex and money.

Homer and his friends are lazy slobs, for whom the will to consume always trumps the obligation to produce. The lurid glow of warm colour suffusing The Simpsons is a kind of atmospheric analogue to the nirvana of inanity induced by the abundance of Duff Beer and Lard Lad Donuts. Homer, like Snoopy, Garfield or Jeffrey \u201cThe Dude\u201d Lebowski, played by Jeff Bridges, is the vicarious channel for the life of aimless sloth many of us would secretly like to live and have been forced to renounce. The slob resists the world\u2019s demands by succumbing to the downward pull of gravity. The daydreamer does so by refusing it, by floating airily above her daily reality. Daydreaming is a refusal to equate life with quotidian existence. Why would anyone want to retreat into the clouds and abandon the urgent claims of life here below? In one of his scandalous inversions of received wisdom, Oscar Wilde suggested that action was the real refuge of \u201cpeople who have nothing whatsoever to do\u201d. \u201cTo do nothing at all,\u201d he adds, \u201cis the most difficult thing in the world,\u201d because it deprives us of the easy evasions of busyness and purpose. Should we doubt this, we need only glance around a cafe, tube carriage or family dinner table and observe the reflexive flight of the eyes and hands around us into the anxious distractions of emails, box sets and Candy Crush. Occasionally, someone comes along and makes us question the superiority of action over contemplation. Take Emily Dickinson, who spent the largest part of her adult life locked in her Amherst bedroom, scratching out nearly 2,000 poems. She opens poem 657 with this provocative declaration: \u201cI dwell in Possibility \u2013 / A fairer House than Prose \u2013 / More numerous of Windows \u2013 / Superior \u2013 for Doors \u2013\u201d. Bound up with this dreamy reclusion is Dickinson\u2019s refusal of marriage, even to the man she was evidently in love with. Withdrawn into the quiet repose of her locked room, \u201cdoing nothing\u201d, she can venture infinitely further and more boldly than a woman bounded by the obligations and conventions of 19th century marriage. The first year of my PhD was a time of increasing anxiety and depressive drift. The illusion of complete daily freedom was fun only for as long as I could forget that I was supposed to be doing something. The growing pile of books and scholarly journals induced in me not productive urgency but debilitating paralysis. I was rescued, not for the first time in my life, by a movie: Richard Linklater\u2019s 1991 Slacker, which I watched enraptured in the back row seat of a sticky floored fleapit. It didn\u2019t take me long to see the aimlessness of my own life reflected in the funhouse mirror of Linklater\u2019s film, comprised of weird, randomly connected episodes from the makeshift subcultures of Austin, Texas, teeming with amateur metaphysicians, tinkerers, petty criminals, anarchists and poseurs, linked only by their uncompromising renunciation of \u201cthe kind of work you have to do to earn a living\u201d. The film\u2019s title seemed to allude less to its characters than to itself, to its own slack relationship to its subjects, at once fascinated and distracted, alive and lackadaisical. Watching Slacker opened up a different way of relating to my own life, one that wasn\u2019t measured and valued by externally imposed targets and achievements. It offered a glimpse of what Roland Barthes called \u201cidiorrhythmy\u201d, \u201cwhere each subject lives according to his own rhythm\u201d. To live life as a slacker means to refuse the regimentation of time and space by the impersonal forces of work and leisure, giving yourself over to the pace and style of the impulses, curiosities and desires unique to you. But it\u2019s equally a social ideal, whereby the rhythms of all our individual lives co-exist without encroaching on each other. No doubt there comes a time when your idiorrhythm can no longer be isolated from everyone else\u2019s, when it must reckon with the externally imposed rhythms of an institutional day or the competing idiorrhythms of lovers or children or pets. But surely this is when it\u2019s most important to keep hold of its spirit of indiscipline, its commitment to activity, and inactivity, without purpose or aim. Perhaps all of us, not least the good citizens and hard workers, have much to learn from the slacker and her counterparts. If we allow our whole selves to be absorbed by the demands and agendas of a persecutory to-do list scribbled by others, we will quickly lose the very dimension of life that makes it worth living. \u2022 Not Working by Josh Cohen is published by Granta.

      "body": "<p>A red flag dropped for David Garcia-Rosen just after it was suggested he create a cricket team for his Bronx high school. </p> <p>Garcia-Rosen, then a dean at International Community High, wanted to start a competitive sports team \u2013 <em>any</em> kind of team \u2013 for his students. With a neighborhood of soccer and baseball players, those sports seemed a natural fit.</p> <p>The Public School Athletic League (PSAL) \u2013 the New York City department of education office that governs scholastic sports across America\u2019s largest city \u2013 had other ideas. There was no chance Garcia-Rosen\u2019s school would get a soccer or baseball team into the leagues, it said. Maybe try <em>cricket</em>, it suggested. Cricket for a school in a city hardly known for an abundance of wickets, stumps, or bails across the five boroughs.</p> <p>\u201cWe gave it a shot,\u201d Garcia-Rosen recalls. \u201cI told the Dominican kids that cricket was a bit like baseball and some Bangladeshi kids kind of led the team. We bought cricket gear and got a cricket coach and then we had a cricket team. We filed our team request for cricket \u2026 and then we got the denial.\u201d</p> <p>High school sports in the United States so frequently evokes Friday Night Lights, the book, movie and TV series that popularized the particular religious fervor of Texas football to a broader audience. But a different reality exists in urban centers like New York that forces students to protest, and in some cases take legal action, for access to school sports.</p> <p>Garcia-Rosen, now director of athletics at the Bronx Academy of Letters, has fought a battle with the New York City department of education for equity in school sports for almost a decade. It\u2019s a match that saw him create the Small School Sports League, a rebel confederation of sorts that was taken over and then shut down by the DOE. It\u2019s a campaign that has won Garcia-Rosen few fans within the city\u2019s education system; at one time he was allegedly described by a DOE executive as \u201cMr Fire and Brimstone\u201d and accused of wanting a \u201cMarxist redistribution of teams\u201d.</p> <p>Garcia-Rosen was bounced into New York City\u2019s infamous \u201crubber room\u201d, a disciplinary purgatory for teachers exiled by the DOE, but has also inspired student-led protests at City Hall and, significantly, a recent lawsuit filed by four Bronx high school students against the DOE, the PSAL and its executive director Donald Douglas. The suit claims student access to school sports is a human and civil rights issue and alleges the DOE\u2019s policy, or lack thereof, adversely impacts the city\u2019s black and Latino population.

      "bodyText": "A red flag dropped for David Garcia-Rosen just after it was suggested he create a cricket team for his Bronx high school. Garcia-Rosen, then a dean at International Community High, wanted to start a competitive sports team \u2013 any kind of team \u2013 for his students. With a neighborhood of soccer and baseball players, those sports seemed a natural fit. The Public School Athletic League (PSAL) \u2013 the New York City department of education office that governs scholastic sports across America\u2019s largest city \u2013 had other ideas. There was no chance Garcia-Rosen\u2019s school would get a soccer or baseball team into the leagues, it said. Maybe try cricket, it suggested. Cricket for a school in a city hardly known for an abundance of wickets, stumps, or bails across the five boroughs. \u201cWe gave it a shot,\u201d Garcia-Rosen recalls. \u201cI told the Dominican kids that cricket was a bit like baseball and some Bangladeshi kids kind of led the team. We bought cricket gear and got a cricket coach and then we had a cricket team. We filed our team request for cricket \u2026 and then we got the denial.\u201d High school sports in the United States so frequently evokes Friday Night Lights, the book, movie and TV series that popularized the particular religious fervor of Texas football to a broader audience. But a different reality exists in urban centers like New York that forces students to protest, and in some cases take legal action, for access to school sports. Garcia-Rosen, now director of athletics at the Bronx Academy of Letters, has fought a battle with the New York City department of education for equity in school sports for almost a decade. It\u2019s a match that saw him create the Small School Sports League, a rebel confederation of sorts that was taken over and then shut down by the DOE. It\u2019s a campaign that has won Garcia-Rosen few fans within the city\u2019s education system; at one time he was allegedly described by a DOE executive as \u201cMr Fire and Brimstone\u201d and accused of wanting a \u201cMarxist redistribution of teams\u201d. Garcia-Rosen was bounced into New York City\u2019s infamous \u201crubber room\u201d, a disciplinary purgatory for teachers exiled by the DOE, but has also inspired student-led protests at City Hall and, significantly, a recent lawsuit filed by four Bronx high school students against the DOE, the PSAL and its executive director Donald Douglas. The suit claims student access to school sports is a human and civil rights issue and alleges the DOE\u2019s policy, or lack thereof, adversely impacts the city\u2019s black and Latino population. It\u2019s also a lawsuit that just might vindicate Garcia-Rosen\u2019s long held concerns. \u201cBlack and Latino students experience far-reaching deprivations of key resources and opportunities,\u201d the suit claims, with accompanying research and data showing how black and Latino high school students in New York City public schools have significantly less access to sports teams than students of other races: 17,323 black and Latino high school students in New York public schools attend high schools with zero PSAL teams. \u201cThe research results and analysis proved what we had anecdotally known,\u201d says Melissa Iachan of the nonprofit New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, a lead attorney on the case. \u201cThe policies and procedures employed by the PSAL discriminate against black and Latino students by depriving them of equal access to resources that should be made publicly available.\u201d New York is not the only big city with sports equity issues. Los Angeles is in the middle of what Renata Simril, president and CEO of LA84, a legacy non-profit organization from the 1984 Olympic Games charged with funding access to sports across the city, describes as \u201ca crisis hiding in plain sight.\u201d While New York\u2019s challenges can be traced to a policy of downsizing failing high schools, in Los Angeles the \u201cno child left behind\u201d program has caused many children to be left behind when it comes to school sports. \u201cThere\u2019s an impetus on math and science curriculum and no increase in funding,\u201d Simril says. \u201cSo schools had to do away with something.

In an editorial on 15 December, the Sun used the phrase to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7990470/jean-claude-juncker-brexit-humilation-sun-on-sunday/\">welcome the prospect</a> of leaving without any kind of withdrawal agreement.

At the same time, the polling company YouGov asked respondents if they believed that \u201cAnything less than a clean break from the EU will be a betrayal of the referendum vote\u201d. Nationally, 48% agreed, and 35% disagreed. On New Year\u2019s Day, Mick Hume, editor-at-large of Spiked, <a href=\"https://www.spiked-online.com/2019/01/01/brexit-2019-the-good-bad-and-could-turn-ugly-options/\">wrote</a> that \u201ca No Deal, clean-break Brexit is the only available option which comes close to fulfilling the demand of 17.4 million Leave voters\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cClean break\u201d is a familiar idiom: a ready-made shorthand. According to the <a href=\"https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/a-clean-break\">Macmillan Dictionary</a>, it means \u201ca sudden complete end to something such as a relationship or a period of time spent in a place\u201d. The example sentence is as follows: <em>After the divorce, I decided to make a clean break and moved to a new town. </em>This is metaphorical, of course. Concretely, a clean break refers to a physical rupture \u2013 of a bone, or piece of wood or stone \u2013 that leaves behind no fragments or jagged edges.</p> <p>And it\u2019s easy to see the appeal of the metaphor. It suggests a new start, unencumbered by the problems of the past. The opposite of a \u201cmessy break-up\u201d. But can it be appropriately transferred to Brexit? It should be pretty clear that we aren\u2019t ending the period of time we\u2019ve been spending off the coast of France. So the geographical usage is out. The Sun, and people sympathetic to its position, must instead be thinking of relationships. But here\u2019s the thing: it will not be possible for the UK to end all contact with the EU. European countries will still be our economic, diplomatic and cultural partners. Our populations are intertwined. There is no way to delete Europe\u2019s number and unfriend it on Facebook. The relationship will certainly continue; what will change is the conduct of it, which will probably become more contested and bureaucratic outside the purpose-built structures of the EU.</p> <p>For these reasons, the same problems apply to other relationship shorthands, as former European Commission staffer Mark English <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EULondonMark/status/1080504218103005184\">pointed out</a> to me on Twitter: \u201cIndeed, \u2018divorce\u2019 was always an imperfect metaphor for leaving EU. Geography/economy/geopolitics mean UK can\u2019t quit the European house and start a new life. It risks ending up stuck in a bedroom while the rest of the family are at the table.\u201d</p> <p>There are those who would argue that if leavers can\u2019t have \u201cclean break\u201d, then remainers aren\u2019t allowed \u201ccrash out\u201d either. Neither correspond precisely to reality, and both serve political ends. But no one\u2019s talking about banning metaphors, which would make natural communication pretty much impossible. What we need to do instead is gauge the width of the reality gap, and apply scepticism accordingly. \u201cCrashing out\u201d, which brings to mind a sudden, potentially violent ejection, might be a reasonable way to characterise the overnight disruption to trade, travel and many other things besides that leaving without a deal would involve. Most people\u2019s lives won\u2019t be hugely disrupted, and the shocks would gradually be absorbed \u2013 but it will be pretty bumpy.</p> <p>A \u201cclean break\u201d, though? Nothing about the above sounds clean. And when the dust settles, we won\u2019t be far out in the Atlantic, but as close to \u2013 and dependent on \u2013 our European neighbours as ever. This is not a run-of-the-mill metaphor: it\u2019s a clever lie. Polls such as YouGov\u2019s cannot be used to assess support for a no-deal exit, since the pollsters have not presented anything like the reality for people to consider.</p> <p>As 29 March approaches, words matter more than perhaps any time in modern British history.

Most people\u2019s lives won\u2019t be hugely disrupted, and the shocks would gradually be absorbed \u2013 but it will be pretty bumpy. A \u201cclean break\u201d, though? Nothing about the above sounds clean. And when the dust settles, we won\u2019t be far out in the Atlantic, but as close to \u2013 and dependent on \u2013 our European neighbours as ever. This is not a run-of-the-mill metaphor: it\u2019s a clever lie. Polls such as YouGov\u2019s cannot be used to assess support for a no-deal exit, since the pollsters have not presented anything like the reality for people to consider. As 29 March approaches, words matter more than perhaps any time in modern British history. Choose yours carefully. \u2022 David Shariatmadari is an editor and writer for the Guardian in London.

His call came after a senior police officer said he \u201cstrongly suspects\u201d gangs are infiltrating the prison service with the intention of smuggling contraband into jails. Jason Hogg, an assistant chief constable and the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council\u2019s lead on prison intelligence, said he feared organised criminals were getting their associates or family members jobs in the prison service in order to sneak illegal items behind bars.

Colman\u2019s Anne has been garnering attention and will likely be a contender for big awards \u2013 but Stone (Abigail) and, particularly, Weisz (Sarah), as the favourites new and old, don\u2019t deserve to be overshadowed.</p> <h2>Mary Poppins Returns (U) </h2> <p><em>(Rob Marshall, 2018, US) 130 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jsfXDZLIY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-3jsfXDZLIY?start=2&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=2\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This freshly scrubbed and sparkling update of Disney\u2019s family favourite from 1964 suggests that Hollywood\u2019s po-mo phase has come to an end.

In the UK she\u2019s still finding her feet, but this will likely be your last chance to see her in smaller venues, so don\u2019t miss out. <br><em><a href=\"https://ellamai.com/\">Birmingham Tuesday 8; Manchester Wednesday 9; London Thursday 10 &amp; Friday 11 January </a></em></p> <h2>Cate Le Bon</h2> <p>In the nearly three years since Welsh musician Cate Le Bon released Crab Day, her lauded fourth album of off-kilter psychedelia, she has enrolled in a furniture-making course in the Lake District, made an album with Tim Presley and produced the new Deerhunter record. This solo piano tour is her idea of taking a break. <br><em><a href=\"http://www.catelebon.com/live/\">D\u00fan Laoghaire, Sunday 6; Hebden Bridge, Tuesday 8; Glasgow, Wednesday 9; Leeds, Thursday 10; London, 12 January </a></em></p> <h2>The 1975</h2> <p>Over the course of three albums Matthew \u201cMatty\u201d Healy and the other three have established themselves as one of the world\u2019s biggest bands, with some critics hailing them as this generation\u2019s Radiohead when it comes to capturing the prevailing mood. Like Thom Yorke, Healy\u2019s also not adverse to busting out some unique dance moves, so brace yourselves. <br><em><a href=\"https://the1975.com/#\">SSE Arena, Belfast, Wednesday 9; 3Arena, Dublin, Thursday 10; touring to 25 January </a></em></p> <h2>Romare</h2> <p>Inspired by the cut\u2019n\u2019paste artworks of African-American artist Romare Bearden, Liverpool-via-Paris producer and DJ Archie Fairhurst fuses electronic music with jazz, psychedelia and samples from secondhand records. Expect to hear some songs from his two studio albums, Projections and Love Songs: Part Two, during this DJ set, plus multiple opportunities to show off his likely immaculate record collection. <br><em><a href=\"https://xoyo.co.uk/whats-on\">XOYO, EC2, Saturday 5 January </a></em></p> <p><em>MC</em></p> <h2>Sarah Jane Morris</h2> <p>The long career of British multi-genre singer-songwriter Sarah Jane Morris has invited comparison with eloquent marvels including Nina Simone, Janis Joplin and \u2013 at her rasping deep end \u2013 even Tom Waits, but ultimately she\u2019s her own woman. These gigs showcase a raft of originals, including her powerful tribute to departed folk legend John Martyn. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.ronniescotts.co.uk/performances/view/4985-sarah-jane-morris\">Ronnie Scott\u2019s, W1, Monday 7 to Wednesday 9 January </a></em></p> <p><em>JF</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best ... classical concerts</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9d385162916cfca9057cb7b3a7001942e308f2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9d385162916cfca9057cb7b3a7001942e308f2b/0_34_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barbara Hannigan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barbara Hannigan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Record Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Sibelius, Abrahamsen and Nielsen</h2> <p>Simon Rattle and the London Symphony Orchestra launch into 2019 with three Nordic masterpieces. Hans Abrahamsen\u2019s spellbinding 2013 song cycle Let Me Tell You \u2013 sung by the soprano for whom it was composed, Barbara Hannigan \u2013 holds its own against two of the 20th century\u2019s greatest symphonies: Sibelius\u2019s Seventh and Nielsen\u2019s Fourth (Thu only). <br><em><a href=\"https://lso.co.uk/whats-on/icalrepeat.detail/2019/01/10/1289/-/nielsen-s-inextinguishable.html\">Barbican Hall, EC2 Wednesday 9 &amp; Thursday 10 January </a></em></p> <h2>Baroque at the Edge</h2> <p>This short festival brings together performers from different backgrounds and invites them to use pieces from the baroque era as the inspirations for their own music. So Elicia Silverstein juxtaposes solo violin works by Bach and Biber with Berio and Sciarrino, singer Nora Fischer and Mike Fentross on theorbo delve into the baroque worlds of Monteverdi and Purcell, and storyteller Nick Hennessy joins forces with guitarist Dave Malkin and 14-string viola d\u2019amore player John Dipper for a fusion of Purcell and English folk. <br><em><a>LSO St Luke\u2019s and Saint James, Clerkenwell, EC1, Saturday 5 &amp; Sunday 6 January </a></em></p> <h2>Venus Unwrapped</h2> <p>The most far-reaching and ambitious of the Unwrapped series so far promises to dominate the 2019 concerts at Kings Place. The achievement of more than 100 female composers, from medieval times to the present day, will be celebrated in 60 events. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment gets it all under way with a programme focusing on the music of Barbara Strozzi, a 17th-century Venetian contemporary of Monteverdi and Cavalli. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.kingsplace.co.uk/magazine/genre/venus-unwrapped/\">Kings Place, N1, from Thursday 10 January </a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best ... exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30670cec846ba4dbf7b69270459503f82a60c3a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30670cec846ba4dbf7b69270459503f82a60c3a5/0_9_2362_1417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"William Kentridge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William Kentridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marian Goodman Gallery, Goodman Gallery and Lia Rumma Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>William Kentridge</h2> <p>The modern age flickers by in black-and-white montages and animated sequences in the films of this rich and thoughtful artist. His moving images are framed by evocative installations that recreate revolutionary Russia or the paradoxes of Einsteinian relativity, while the politics of his homeland, South Africa, are seen in epic perspective. <br><em><a href=\"http://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/currentexhibitions/williamkentridge/\">The Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester to 3 March</a></em></p> <h2>Pin-Ups: Toulouse-Lautrec and the Art of Celebrity</h2> <p>The vision of Toulouse-Lautrec takes you into a very modern world of vulnerability and glamour. In his proto-pop art, he portrays the dancers and prostitutes of fin-de-si\u00e8cle Paris with a sympathy that comes from close friendship. His posters are eternally seductive, his pastels intimate. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationalgalleries.org/exhibition/pin-ups-toulouse-lautrec-and-art-celebrity\">Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh, to 20 January </a></em></p> <h2>Mantegna and Bellini</h2> <p>Andrea Mantegna was court artist in the small Italian city state of Mantua, where his Roman-style house and captivating frescoes still bear witness to his ambition and brilliance. His brother-in-law Giovanni Bellini was the most gifted artist in 15th-century Venice, painting sensual Christs and haunting skies. This exhibition surveys them in parallel, from their occasional friendly competitions to their grand classical paintings. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/mantegna-and-bellini\">The National Gallery, WC2, to 27 January </a></em></p> <h2>Charles II: Art &amp; Power</h2> <p>The reign of Charles II saw changes that paved the way for modern Britain: a scientific revolution transformed attitudes to nature and technology, and London became a world city, in spite of plague and fire. This excellent exhibition charts those changes with exhibits including some of the first images recorded with a microscope, portraits of the royal mistresses, and Renaissance paintings that Charles owned. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.rct.uk/collection/themes/exhibitions/charles-ii-art-power/the-queens-gallery-palace-of-holyroodhouse?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIou6v8PbR3wIV7JztCh3nUQZ2EAAYAiAAEgIgXPD_BwE\">The Queen\u2019s Gallery at the Palace of Holyrood House, Edinburgh, to 2 January</a></em></p> <h2>Life in the Dark</h2> <p>Sometimes midwinter feels like living in the dark, but for many species that\u2019s normal. This exhibition starts with Britain\u2019s nocturnal creatures and then goes deeper into darkness, from blind fish and pale reptiles in caves to the bizarre forms found in the deep sea.

Musical star Jodie Prenger (Oliver!, Calamity Jane) plays Beverly, the pushy hostess from hell who organises a party for her newly married neighbours. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.visitbrighton.com/things-to-do/theatre-royal-brighton-p348001\">Theatre Royal, Brighton, Thursday 10 to 19 January; touring to 20 April</a></em></p> <h2>Approaching Empty</h2> <p>Ishy Din, who has written for school drama Ackley Bridge, pens this evocation of the struggles of a post-industrial generation of British South-Asian men.

      "bodyText": "Five of the best ... films The Favourite (15) (Yorgos Lanthimos, 2018, Ire/UK/US) 119 mins Three great performances \u2013 from Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone \u2013 ballast this brilliant fable of jostling power brokers at the 18th-century court of Queen Anne. Colman\u2019s Anne has been garnering attention and will likely be a contender for big awards \u2013 but Stone (Abigail) and, particularly, Weisz (Sarah), as the favourites new and old, don\u2019t deserve to be overshadowed. Mary Poppins Returns (U) (Rob Marshall, 2018, US) 130 mins This freshly scrubbed and sparkling update of Disney\u2019s family favourite from 1964 suggests that Hollywood\u2019s po-mo phase has come to an end. There\u2019s barely any self-referentiality or reinvention on show here; it\u2019s basically a throwback, as exact a replica as possible of the original. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that. RBG (PG) (Julie Cohen, Betsy West, 2018, US) 98 mins Celebratory portrait of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the equality rights lawyer who is now a key veteran of the US supreme court \u2013 and who has become a touchstone in digital culture, with blogs, Tumblrs and gifs by the bucketload dedicated to her. This doc, via copious interviews with RBG herself as well as legions of admirers, traces her path to the top as she is held to be America\u2019s most enduring liberal conscience. The Passenger (15) (Michelangelo Antonioni, 1975, It/Sp/Fr) 125 mins The third in Antonioni\u2019s English-language trilogy (following Blow-Up and Zabriskie Point) has developed a cult reputation over the decades. Jack Nicholson plays a reporter who acquires the identity of a dead man \u2013 who turns out to be a gun runner with nasty people in tow. Maria Schneider, just a couple of years after Last Tango in Paris, plays a young student who helps him as he tries to evade his pursuers. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (PG) (Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman, 2018, US) 117 mins Novel and impressive attempt to refresh the Spider-Man franchise, at risk from drowning in reboots. This animated take pulls Spideys in from parallel dimensions, upping the diversity count and providing ample spin-off fuel. AP Five of the best ... rock &amp; pop Ella Mai In the space of four years, London\u2019s Ella Mai has gone from X Factor reject (her girlband trio Arize didn\u2019t make it past their initial audition) to earning two Grammy nominations for Boo\u2019d Up, a spacious, future-R&amp;B classic that nestled in the US Top 10 last summer. In the UK she\u2019s still finding her feet, but this will likely be your last chance to see her in smaller venues, so don\u2019t miss out. Birmingham Tuesday 8; Manchester Wednesday 9; London Thursday 10 &amp; Friday 11 January Cate Le Bon In the nearly three years since Welsh musician Cate Le Bon released Crab Day, her lauded fourth album of off-kilter psychedelia, she has enrolled in a furniture-making course in the Lake District, made an album with Tim Presley and produced the new Deerhunter record. This solo piano tour is her idea of taking a break. D\u00fan Laoghaire, Sunday 6; Hebden Bridge, Tuesday 8; Glasgow, Wednesday 9; Leeds, Thursday 10; London, 12 January The 1975 Over the course of three albums Matthew \u201cMatty\u201d Healy and the other three have established themselves as one of the world\u2019s biggest bands, with some critics hailing them as this generation\u2019s Radiohead when it comes to capturing the prevailing mood. Like Thom Yorke, Healy\u2019s also not adverse to busting out some unique dance moves, so brace yourselves. SSE Arena, Belfast, Wednesday 9; 3Arena, Dublin, Thursday 10; touring to 25 January Romare Inspired by the cut\u2019n\u2019paste artworks of African-American artist Romare Bearden, Liverpool-via-Paris producer and DJ Archie Fairhurst fuses electronic music with jazz, psychedelia and samples from secondhand records. Expect to hear some songs from his two studio albums, Projections and Love Songs: Part Two, during this DJ set, plus multiple opportunities to show off his likely immaculate record collection. XOYO, EC2, Saturday 5 January MC Sarah Jane Morris The long career of British multi-genre singer-songwriter Sarah Jane Morris has invited comparison with eloquent marvels including Nina Simone, Janis Joplin and \u2013 at her rasping deep end \u2013 even Tom Waits, but ultimately she\u2019s her own woman. These gigs showcase a raft of originals, including her powerful tribute to departed folk legend John Martyn. Ronnie Scott\u2019s, W1, Monday 7 to Wednesday 9 January JF Three of the best ... classical concerts Sibelius, Abrahamsen and Nielsen Simon Rattle and the London Symphony Orchestra launch into 2019 with three Nordic masterpieces. Hans Abrahamsen\u2019s spellbinding 2013 song cycle Let Me Tell You \u2013 sung by the soprano for whom it was composed, Barbara Hannigan \u2013 holds its own against two of the 20th century\u2019s greatest symphonies: Sibelius\u2019s Seventh and Nielsen\u2019s Fourth (Thu only). Barbican Hall, EC2 Wednesday 9 &amp; Thursday 10 January Baroque at the Edge This short festival brings together performers from different backgrounds and invites them to use pieces from the baroque era as the inspirations for their own music. So Elicia Silverstein juxtaposes solo violin works by Bach and Biber with Berio and Sciarrino, singer Nora Fischer and Mike Fentross on theorbo delve into the baroque worlds of Monteverdi and Purcell, and storyteller Nick Hennessy joins forces with guitarist Dave Malkin and 14-string viola d\u2019amore player John Dipper for a fusion of Purcell and English folk. LSO St Luke\u2019s and Saint James, Clerkenwell, EC1, Saturday 5 &amp; Sunday 6 January Venus Unwrapped The most far-reaching and ambitious of the Unwrapped series so far promises to dominate the 2019 concerts at Kings Place. The achievement of more than 100 female composers, from medieval times to the present day, will be celebrated in 60 events. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment gets it all under way with a programme focusing on the music of Barbara Strozzi, a 17th-century Venetian contemporary of Monteverdi and Cavalli. Kings Place, N1, from Thursday 10 January AC Five of the best ... exhibitions William Kentridge The modern age flickers by in black-and-white montages and animated sequences in the films of this rich and thoughtful artist. His moving images are framed by evocative installations that recreate revolutionary Russia or the paradoxes of Einsteinian relativity, while the politics of his homeland, South Africa, are seen in epic perspective. The Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester to 3 March Pin-Ups: Toulouse-Lautrec and the Art of Celebrity The vision of Toulouse-Lautrec takes you into a very modern world of vulnerability and glamour. In his proto-pop art, he portrays the dancers and prostitutes of fin-de-si\u00e8cle Paris with a sympathy that comes from close friendship. His posters are eternally seductive, his pastels intimate. Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh, to 20 January Mantegna and Bellini Andrea Mantegna was court artist in the small Italian city state of Mantua, where his Roman-style house and captivating frescoes still bear witness to his ambition and brilliance. His brother-in-law Giovanni Bellini was the most gifted artist in 15th-century Venice, painting sensual Christs and haunting skies. This exhibition surveys them in parallel, from their occasional friendly competitions to their grand classical paintings. The National Gallery, WC2, to 27 January Charles II: Art &amp; Power The reign of Charles II saw changes that paved the way for modern Britain: a scientific revolution transformed attitudes to nature and technology, and London became a world city, in spite of plague and fire. This excellent exhibition charts those changes with exhibits including some of the first images recorded with a microscope, portraits of the royal mistresses, and Renaissance paintings that Charles owned. The Queen\u2019s Gallery at the Palace of Holyrood House, Edinburgh, to 2 January Life in the Dark Sometimes midwinter feels like living in the dark, but for many species that\u2019s normal. This exhibition starts with Britain\u2019s nocturnal creatures and then goes deeper into darkness, from blind fish and pale reptiles in caves to the bizarre forms found in the deep sea. Immersive installations and extraordinary specimens are combined with the latest research. Natural History Museum, SW7, to 24 February JJ Five of the best ... theatre shows Abigail\u2019s Party Break out the cheese-and-pineapple nibbles and the chilled Beaujolais (these days that\u2019s an accepted thing) and put on the Demis Roussos record for another revival of Mike Leigh\u2019s iconic 70s comedy of suburban manners and snobbery. Musical star Jodie Prenger (Oliver!, Calamity Jane) plays Beverly, the pushy hostess from hell who organises a party for her newly married neighbours. Theatre Royal, Brighton, Thursday 10 to 19 January; touring to 20 April Approaching Empty Ishy Din, who has written for school drama Ackley Bridge, pens this evocation of the struggles of a post-industrial generation of British South-Asian men. When minicab office worker Mansha decides to buy the business from a lifelong chum, he discovers the difficulties of working with friends and family. Kiln Theatre, NW6, Wednesday 9 January to 2 February; touring to 13 April Coming Clean A transfer from the King\u2019s Head Theatre, Islington, this was the first play by Kevin Elyot, author of the award-winning My Night With Reg.

Councils should consider it imperative that BME women have access to organisations that can treat them as more than just their identity as women. Organisations that can take into account the different ways BME survivors are affected by race, class and insecure immigration status, among other factors, are what these women deserve.</p> <p>Yet what is clear is that if a generic provider can offer services for less, squeezed budgets mandate that specialist organisations will also be squeezed. In doing so there is the tacit denial of the added value the BME ending VAWG sector brings. The importance of being able to speak a language, to work across complex extended family systems, to provide isolated women seeking refuge a sense of community, all is obscured and diminished in the world of criteria and tenders. Race can, conveniently, not be factored in, in order to ignore altogether the particular needs of BME survivors. Imkaan, in a <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/c3n2gjs4g2g37s2/IMKAAN%20-%20STATE%20OF%20THE%20SECTOR%20%5BFINAL%5D.pdf?dl=0\" title=\"\">report from 2015</a> found that in London <a href=\"https://www.womensviewsonnews.org/2015/11/new-report-on-bme-womens-services/\" title=\"\">733 BME women sought refuge spaces</a>, yet only 154 were successful. Race compounds survivors\u2019 experience of violence and it is organisations run by and for BME women and girls that are best placed to help them navigate these systemic inequalities. As such the women working in these organisations are often community leaders, change-makers ready to undertake crucial grassroots activism that contributes significantly to the broader social justice movement.</p> <p>I was reminded of this at a Black History Month event put together by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClaudiaJonesOrg\" title=\"\">the Claudia Jones Organisation</a>, a VAWG charity working with African-Caribbean women and their families. Eating my rice and peas, competitively whispering answers to the black history quiz so that elders on opposing teams wouldn\u2019t be able to steal answers, I was humbled by how many generations had gathered together. Five months earlier I had been speaking to a group of mothers accessing the charity\u2019s services for a campaign against school cuts. Women\u2019s multiple identities was clearly crucial to its approach. The work of sustaining communities, so often undertaken by many BME organisations tackling gender-based violence, is not regarded as added value. It is, instead, erased altogether from a clinical process judging organisations solely on numbers. We negate such public service at our own peril.</p> <p>Tory austerity does, of course, provide the broader context for why this is happening. The issue still remains: for BME women the impact on us is devastating and disproportionate. Those who commission services for women fleeing violence cheapen the work that BME organisations in the sector do. They give more than the sum of their parts. By investing so little in them, they are selling short the women and communities those very organisations serve.</p> <p>\u2022 Lola Okolosie is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Imkaan, in a report from 2015 found that in London 733 BME women sought refuge spaces, yet only 154 were successful. Race compounds survivors\u2019 experience of violence and it is organisations run by and for BME women and girls that are best placed to help them navigate these systemic inequalities. As such the women working in these organisations are often community leaders, change-makers ready to undertake crucial grassroots activism that contributes significantly to the broader social justice movement. I was reminded of this at a Black History Month event put together by the Claudia Jones Organisation, a VAWG charity working with African-Caribbean women and their families. Eating my rice and peas, competitively whispering answers to the black history quiz so that elders on opposing teams wouldn\u2019t be able to steal answers, I was humbled by how many generations had gathered together. Five months earlier I had been speaking to a group of mothers accessing the charity\u2019s services for a campaign against school cuts. Women\u2019s multiple identities was clearly crucial to its approach. The work of sustaining communities, so often undertaken by many BME organisations tackling gender-based violence, is not regarded as added value. It is, instead, erased altogether from a clinical process judging organisations solely on numbers. We negate such public service at our own peril. Tory austerity does, of course, provide the broader context for why this is happening. The issue still remains: for BME women the impact on us is devastating and disproportionate. Those who commission services for women fleeing violence cheapen the work that BME organisations in the sector do. They give more than the sum of their parts. By investing so little in them, they are selling short the women and communities those very organisations serve. \u2022 Lola Okolosie is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>The penultimate song on the Chainsmokers\u2019 second album would register malign on any timeline, let alone one where the president threatens journalists and musicians keep dying young. On <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hMQe2U4c6w\">You Owe Me</a>, Drew Taggart scolds the callous media and suggests: \u201cThey wanna see me hang on the wall.\u201d He continues: \u201cCheck my pulse and if I\u2019m dead, you owe me.\u201d (That aside, it\u2019s the album\u2019s best song, its unusual horn arrangement evoking Vampire Weekend.)</p> <p>To hear Taggart tell it, he\u2019s a martyr, not half of the EDM duo catapulted to fame on a <a href=\"https://www.villagevoice.com/2014/04/01/sorry-selfie-is-sexist/\">slimy single</a> and <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/7510387/the-chainsmokers-billboard-cover-closer\">absurd interviews</a> that found him and Alex Pall comparing penises. To be fair, they\u2019ve moved on \u2013 or, sensing pop\u2019s shift towards introspective nihilism, moved with the money and scored silly streaming numbers with petulant songs about running off to Paris and having sex in unaffordable cars.</p> <p>Although, as Sick Boy makes plain, these days there is no such thing in the Chainsmokers\u2019 world as unaffordable cars. This sorry situation supplies many problems. \u201cAll the things I could live without,\u201d guest vocalist Drew Love sings on Somebody, \u201cI need \u2019em now \u2019cause they\u2019re all around me.\u201d Dolorous piano chords hang heavy; a dank synth note drags like the diamond-crusted albatross around their neck. It gets worse: \u201cEveryone knows what I look like,\u201d Taggart moans on Everybody Hates Me, \u201cnot even one of them knows me.\u201d So, he walks into the club like everybody hates him, and his funereal mumble explodes into EDM bombast, exposing the gulf between his feelings and reality with characteristic subtlety.</p> <p>Life on social media makes these sentiments relatable, they claim.

      "bodyText": "The penultimate song on the Chainsmokers\u2019 second album would register malign on any timeline, let alone one where the president threatens journalists and musicians keep dying young. On You Owe Me, Drew Taggart scolds the callous media and suggests: \u201cThey wanna see me hang on the wall.\u201d He continues: \u201cCheck my pulse and if I\u2019m dead, you owe me.\u201d (That aside, it\u2019s the album\u2019s best song, its unusual horn arrangement evoking Vampire Weekend.) To hear Taggart tell it, he\u2019s a martyr, not half of the EDM duo catapulted to fame on a slimy single and absurd interviews that found him and Alex Pall comparing penises. To be fair, they\u2019ve moved on \u2013 or, sensing pop\u2019s shift towards introspective nihilism, moved with the money and scored silly streaming numbers with petulant songs about running off to Paris and having sex in unaffordable cars. Although, as Sick Boy makes plain, these days there is no such thing in the Chainsmokers\u2019 world as unaffordable cars. This sorry situation supplies many problems. \u201cAll the things I could live without,\u201d guest vocalist Drew Love sings on Somebody, \u201cI need \u2019em now \u2019cause they\u2019re all around me.\u201d Dolorous piano chords hang heavy; a dank synth note drags like the diamond-crusted albatross around their neck. It gets worse: \u201cEveryone knows what I look like,\u201d Taggart moans on Everybody Hates Me, \u201cnot even one of them knows me.\u201d So, he walks into the club like everybody hates him, and his funereal mumble explodes into EDM bombast, exposing the gulf between his feelings and reality with characteristic subtlety. Life on social media makes these sentiments relatable, they claim. With one astute exception (\u201cI can\u2019t even check the time without facing regret\u201d), it doesn\u2019t. Here are filthy-rich men complaining about the problems of being filthy rich. They neg women in one song (Side Effects) and act like sensitive bros for knowing what negging is on another (Hope). They make suspect references to \u201cred pill\u201d culture. Amid this disingenuous dross, the mercifully wordless EDM bombast strikes the most honest note.

Limp Bizkit</strong></h2> \n<h2>Rollin\u2019 (Air Raid Vehicle) (2000)</h2> \n<p>Despite his disdain for early 2000s choreography queens Britney and Christina, Fred Durst wasn\u2019t immune to a dance craze. In this typically understated nu-metal video, he distinguishes his manly moves by throwing down on a helipad (very dangerous!) and inviting viewers to celebrate the size of his ... steering wheel.</p> \n<h2><strong>14. Black Lace</strong></h2> \n<h2>Agadoo (1984)</h2> \n<p>The classic novelty single was inspired by distant climes whose locals, one imagines, wouldn\u2019t be seen dead dancing to it. Sure, it ruined your school disco, but consider the plight of singer Dene Michael Betteridge, who was forced to perform the song\u2019s lumpen moves when in jail for benefit fraud. \u201cThese terrifying criminals <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/various-artists-5301-1200954\" title=\"\">tell you to do something, you do it</a>,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POv-3yIPSWc\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/POv-3yIPSWc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Agadoo\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>13. Billy Ray Cyrus</strong></h2> \n<h2>Achy Breaky Heart (1992)</h2> \n<p>The only way to get smooth, mullet-sporting Cyrus on traditional country radio was to play up his horndog status. A choreographer taught the distinctive line dance to the female fans who turned up for the video shoot, the label organised a dance contest and the 90s line-dancing fad was born (before dying with Steps\u2019 monstrous 5, 6, 7, 8).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byQIPdHMpjc\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/byQIPdHMpjc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>12. Steps</strong></h2> \n<h2>Tragedy (1998)</h2> \n<p>If my bandmates ruined my wedding, I wouldn\u2019t be inclined to accompany them to a disco and knock out a rinky-dink dance routine, but such is life in the video for Tragedy. The hands-by-the-ears dance moves could be likened to Edvard Munch\u2019s The Scream, if you had lost your mind and critical faculties.</p> \n<h2><strong>11. REM</strong></h2> \n<h2>Stand (1988)</h2> \n<p>REM challenged themselves to write this dumb bubblegum song, which swiftly became their second US Top 10 hit. Needing a video to match, the director, Katherine Dieckmann, determined to break down Michael Stipe\u2019s \u201cstaid\u201d public image with this mildly aerobic, entirely charming routine that provoked much playground copycatting. A lark, but a self-aware and not-unkind one.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"99d185e19cf677a68d4ebe590462a2a2ce5c660e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99d185e19cf677a68d4ebe590462a2a2ce5c660e/63_0_826_826/500.jpg\" alt=\"Russ does the Gun Lean\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russ does the Gun Lean</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Grab</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>10. Russ</strong></h2> \n<h2>Gun Lean (2018)</h2> \n<p>US rap spurs global viral dances, but the UK scene isn\u2019t too shabby at it. Following Skepta\u2019s Rolex Sweep and KIG\u2019s Head, Shoulders, Kneez &amp; Toez, Gun Lean finds Russ performing his glitchy, lean-back bob in Sainsbury\u2019s cereal aisle and moving embattled drill closer to the (snap, crackle and) pop mainstream.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nCoGjORGvg\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2nCoGjORGvg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Gun Lean\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"019b27eca5e125b2b0e876033f6022895040b0a0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/019b27eca5e125b2b0e876033f6022895040b0a0/0_57_588_735/400.jpg\" alt=\"Whigfield\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saturday Night</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DPA picture alliance/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>9.

The Bangles</strong></h2> \n<h2>Walk Like an Egyptian (1986)</h2> \n<p>Perhaps the only video to feature Princess Diana, Gaddafi and the Statue of Liberty, whose limbs were computer-manipulated into mimicking the ancient Egyptian reliefs that inspired the song. On one hand, this two-arm movement couldn\u2019t be easier; on the other, the video reveals dozens of uncoordinated New Yorkers making an enjoyable hash of it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"00c2952c8c15de112cbbe0a6515e95e60218591d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00c2952c8c15de112cbbe0a6515e95e60218591d/0_0_1051_2077/506.jpg\" alt=\"Psy\" width=\"506\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gangnam Style</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: OZAN KOSE/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>7. Psy</strong></h2> \n<h2>Gangnam Style (2012)</h2> \n<p>Who knew that Psy\u2019s pony-spanking dance could do so much harm? It has led to deaths, rival gang shootouts, near-fatal LSD trips, conspiracy theories, fraudster arrests, Ed Balls\u2019 spirited jockeying and illegal firecracker production.

But one element of the song mercifully didn\u2019t go mainstream: namely the \u201cSuperman\u201d, which Urban Dictionary details as the emission of a certain fluid that then dries into a cape-like layer.

      "bodyText": "15. Limp Bizkit Rollin\u2019 (Air Raid Vehicle) (2000) Despite his disdain for early 2000s choreography queens Britney and Christina, Fred Durst wasn\u2019t immune to a dance craze. In this typically understated nu-metal video, he distinguishes his manly moves by throwing down on a helipad (very dangerous!) and inviting viewers to celebrate the size of his ... steering wheel. 14. Black Lace Agadoo (1984) The classic novelty single was inspired by distant climes whose locals, one imagines, wouldn\u2019t be seen dead dancing to it. Sure, it ruined your school disco, but consider the plight of singer Dene Michael Betteridge, who was forced to perform the song\u2019s lumpen moves when in jail for benefit fraud. \u201cThese terrifying criminals tell you to do something, you do it,\u201d he said. 13. Billy Ray Cyrus Achy Breaky Heart (1992) The only way to get smooth, mullet-sporting Cyrus on traditional country radio was to play up his horndog status. A choreographer taught the distinctive line dance to the female fans who turned up for the video shoot, the label organised a dance contest and the 90s line-dancing fad was born (before dying with Steps\u2019 monstrous 5, 6, 7, 8). 12. Steps Tragedy (1998) If my bandmates ruined my wedding, I wouldn\u2019t be inclined to accompany them to a disco and knock out a rinky-dink dance routine, but such is life in the video for Tragedy. The hands-by-the-ears dance moves could be likened to Edvard Munch\u2019s The Scream, if you had lost your mind and critical faculties. 11. REM Stand (1988) REM challenged themselves to write this dumb bubblegum song, which swiftly became their second US Top 10 hit. Needing a video to match, the director, Katherine Dieckmann, determined to break down Michael Stipe\u2019s \u201cstaid\u201d public image with this mildly aerobic, entirely charming routine that provoked much playground copycatting. A lark, but a self-aware and not-unkind one. 10. Russ Gun Lean (2018) US rap spurs global viral dances, but the UK scene isn\u2019t too shabby at it. Following Skepta\u2019s Rolex Sweep and KIG\u2019s Head, Shoulders, Kneez &amp; Toez, Gun Lean finds Russ performing his glitchy, lean-back bob in Sainsbury\u2019s cereal aisle and moving embattled drill closer to the (snap, crackle and) pop mainstream. 9. Whigfield Saturday Night (1994) The Saturday Night dance didn\u2019t originate with Whigfield, but by the time she performed the No 1 hit on Top of the Pops, the kinetic, bunny-hopping bop had become such a phenomenon that the Dane had no choice but to scowl as some talentless buffoons performed it around her. Its legacy endures in regional aqua aerobics classes. 8. The Bangles Walk Like an Egyptian (1986) Perhaps the only video to feature Princess Diana, Gaddafi and the Statue of Liberty, whose limbs were computer-manipulated into mimicking the ancient Egyptian reliefs that inspired the song. On one hand, this two-arm movement couldn\u2019t be easier; on the other, the video reveals dozens of uncoordinated New Yorkers making an enjoyable hash of it. 7. Psy Gangnam Style (2012) Who knew that Psy\u2019s pony-spanking dance could do so much harm? It has led to deaths, rival gang shootouts, near-fatal LSD trips, conspiracy theories, fraudster arrests, Ed Balls\u2019 spirited jockeying and illegal firecracker production. Not to mention all the slipped discs. 6. Soulja Boy Crank That (2007) Most of the moves detailed in Crank That are easily replicable \u2013 punching, starting a motorbike, the robot \u2013 hence its breakout success. But one element of the song mercifully didn\u2019t go mainstream: namely the \u201cSuperman\u201d, which Urban Dictionary details as the emission of a certain fluid that then dries into a cape-like layer. Grisly. 5. Chubby Checker The Twist (1960) The first global dance craze is a softer, desexualised version of a dance that stems back to 19th-century slaves and looks incredibly gentle today. Still, it provoked endearing bafflement among commentators at the time, who likened its \u201cpiston-like motions\u201d to \u201cbaffled bird keepers fighting off a flock of attacking blue jays\u201d. 4. Los Del R\u00edo Macarena (1995) The Macarena has fallen on hard times: macarena.com is canvassing for donations to stay up and running. But the methodical dance to one of the biggest one-hit wonders will live on, at least until the last 90s kid who can do it in their sleep passes away. Hey! 3. Bee Gees Night Fever (1978) The \u201cfaces\u201d of the New York disco scene that inspired Saturday Night Fever were uniquely stylish men (at least, in Nik Cohn\u2019s fabricated Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night feature). But the beauty of the diagonal point-and-bob, so immaculately done by John Travolta, is that any drunk slob can pull it off with aplomb. 2. Beyonc\u00e9 Single Ladies (2008) Of all the moves in Single Ladies \u2013 the Bob Fosse-inspired routine that spawned a thousand high-end exercise classes, the finger-waggy \u201chuh oh oh\u201ds aimed at giving nans an easy bit to follow \u2013 none is as arresting as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s final pose as she audibly gasps for breath after nailing it. 1. Village People YMCA (1978) Some of pop history\u2019s finest moments turn on a flash of recontextualisation that sticks for ever: the interview that recast the Spice Girls as Scary, Ginger and co; an outraged Mike Read pulling Relax off air, stoking its notoriety. You can watch one happen when the Village People performed YMCA on Dick Clark\u2019s American Bandstand in January 1979. The group hadn\u2019t choreographed a dance, but the audience, mistaking the band\u2019s raised arms in the chorus for a Y formation, invented one on the spot. Clark, agog, made everyone do it again immediately. Forty years on, we\u2019ve never stopped.",

We have since seen Kidman excelling in every register from brittle acid comedy (Margot at the Wedding) to sexed-up southern gothic derangement (The Paperboy) to quiet-storm trauma release (her astonishing, Emmy-winning turn on TV\u2019s Big Little Lies), with enough bizarre missteps and undeserved misfires in between to give her career a jaggedly complicated arc. All of which is to say that pretty much everything Kidman has done in her career has prepared us \u2013 and more importantly, her \u2013 for the role of raggedly bent Los Angeles cop Erin Bell in Kusama\u2019s film, if only because it\u2019s hard these days to think of what a typical Kidman role might be.</p> <p>On the outside, at least. For it\u2019s what emerges from beneath that disorientingly scorched, ruined exterior that feels more familiar to Kidman, as Bell proves another expert study in her gallery of smart women who lie to themselves \u2014 the film\u2019s niftily two-pronged narrative finds her chasing a fortune in the past, leading to a curdled blend of redemption and revenge in the present, kidding herself all the way about how easy or successful the pursuit might be. And she suffers for it, perhaps more physically and viscerally than in any Kidman vehicle since Lars von Trier put her through the wringer in Dogville. The beatings she takes here, filmed by Kusama with the kind of blunt, unfetishised frankness that male action directors rarely direct at female protagonists, are entirely startling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0cca0b10aeab8b3629f429024da9bcbbaf9dce5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cca0b10aeab8b3629f429024da9bcbbaf9dce5b/0_0_3007_1236/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"411\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Genre films like Destroyer are rarely framed around female characters; when they are, the heroine tends to be portrayed as dully indestructible, her feminine attributes either pushed aside in favour of \u201cone of the boys\u201d toughness or flattened into a one-dimensional form of girl power. In this regard, Destroyer makes an interesting companion piece to Steve McQueen and Gillian Flynn\u2019s sharp, angry update of Lynda La Plante\u2019s Widows \u2013 another bleak, hard-boiled genre piece to unusually place a fiftysomething woman at the active centre of its copious action. Erin Bell and Viola Davis\u2019s Veronica Rawlings certainly share enough flawed, disappointment-fuelled determination to power a fiercely driven underworld mission; squint a little, and it\u2019s not too hard to imagine how their narratives might intersect. Both films make the case for women who have been around the block a little as persuasive action heroes.</p> <p>Kidman\u2019s Bell is resilient, certainly, but her damage is foregrounded to prove it, in her scarred, choked voice (deftly lowered from the flashbacks) and her jarring makeover: that face isn\u2019t a mere attention-grabbing stunt, but the required external manifestation of all the repeated effort and failure she\u2019s expended and endured as a cop, as a lover and, we come to learn, as a mother too. The overriding spirit of Kidman\u2019s performance is one of a distinctly feminine exhaustion, the impact of having to work harder than the dismissive men surrounding her just to keep her head above water \u2013 and not always excelling in the process. However might a 51-year-old woman with three decades\u2019 experience of working in pre-#TimesUp Hollywood channel such feeling? Perhaps Destroyer isn\u2019t such a leap for the star after all.</p>",

All of which is to say that pretty much everything Kidman has done in her career has prepared us \u2013 and more importantly, her \u2013 for the role of raggedly bent Los Angeles cop Erin Bell in Kusama\u2019s film, if only because it\u2019s hard these days to think of what a typical Kidman role might be. On the outside, at least. For it\u2019s what emerges from beneath that disorientingly scorched, ruined exterior that feels more familiar to Kidman, as Bell proves another expert study in her gallery of smart women who lie to themselves \u2014 the film\u2019s niftily two-pronged narrative finds her chasing a fortune in the past, leading to a curdled blend of redemption and revenge in the present, kidding herself all the way about how easy or successful the pursuit might be. And she suffers for it, perhaps more physically and viscerally than in any Kidman vehicle since Lars von Trier put her through the wringer in Dogville. The beatings she takes here, filmed by Kusama with the kind of blunt, unfetishised frankness that male action directors rarely direct at female protagonists, are entirely startling. Genre films like Destroyer are rarely framed around female characters; when they are, the heroine tends to be portrayed as dully indestructible, her feminine attributes either pushed aside in favour of \u201cone of the boys\u201d toughness or flattened into a one-dimensional form of girl power. In this regard, Destroyer makes an interesting companion piece to Steve McQueen and Gillian Flynn\u2019s sharp, angry update of Lynda La Plante\u2019s Widows \u2013 another bleak, hard-boiled genre piece to unusually place a fiftysomething woman at the active centre of its copious action. Erin Bell and Viola Davis\u2019s Veronica Rawlings certainly share enough flawed, disappointment-fuelled determination to power a fiercely driven underworld mission; squint a little, and it\u2019s not too hard to imagine how their narratives might intersect. Both films make the case for women who have been around the block a little as persuasive action heroes. Kidman\u2019s Bell is resilient, certainly, but her damage is foregrounded to prove it, in her scarred, choked voice (deftly lowered from the flashbacks) and her jarring makeover: that face isn\u2019t a mere attention-grabbing stunt, but the required external manifestation of all the repeated effort and failure she\u2019s expended and endured as a cop, as a lover and, we come to learn, as a mother too. The overriding spirit of Kidman\u2019s performance is one of a distinctly feminine exhaustion, the impact of having to work harder than the dismissive men surrounding her just to keep her head above water \u2013 and not always excelling in the process. However might a 51-year-old woman with three decades\u2019 experience of working in pre-#TimesUp Hollywood channel such feeling? Perhaps Destroyer isn\u2019t such a leap for the star after all.",

      "body": "<p>Bridget Collins\u2019s fantasy novel, her first for adults, begins sombrely, with its teenage hero Emmett being sent away from his family farm to become an apprentice to a binder of books. He\u2019s weak after a long illness of a mysterious nature and, from his family\u2019s strained behaviour, we intuit that he\u2019s in some kind of disgrace he doesn\u2019t fully understand. When he arrives at the isolated house of Seredith, the elderly woman to whom he\u2019s apprenticed, it\u2019s both an exile and a haven. He spends his days learning to make endpapers, tool leather, gilding \u2013 the delicate physical labour of making beautiful books. But he soon realises that the true work of binding is magical, manifested in the way that lives are turned into stories.</p> <p>Distressed people arrive at Seredith\u2019s, asking to have their traumatic experiences put down on paper; once that is done, the memories are erased. They leave dulled but soothed, and in her cellar, Seredith keeps their secrets safe in gorgeous books with the subject\u2019s name on the spine. Of course, somewhere among them is a book with Emmett\u2019s name on it, which contains the secret of his disgrace. When Seredith dies, the books fall into unscrupulous hands, and Emmett is set on a path to recover his lost past.</p> <p>In many ways, <em>The Binding</em> is an unpretentious work of escapist fiction. The morality of the book is simple; the good are essentially noble and their enemies unambiguously wicked. The vaguely antiquated setting could as easily be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/apr/05/game-of-thrones-westeros-travel-guide\" title=\"\">Westeros</a> or Hardy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/jun/06/thomas-hardy-dorset-walking-guide\" title=\"\">Wessex</a>. At the heart of the novel is a love story that develops along a familiar trajectory, from immediate dislike to inexplicable flutters of the heart to full infatuation with its feeling of being \u201cbreathless and dizzy, as if my blood was too thin\u201d. When the protagonists are happy, it\u2019s spring outdoors. When things go wrong, a wet snow falls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05b045cfe0d5164d48f2cac5a035a10e35a2d80a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05b045cfe0d5164d48f2cac5a035a10e35a2d80a/0_374_4457_2675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Strangford Lough, AKA Westeros \u2026\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strangford Lough, AKA Westeros \u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Radharc Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But while some elements are overfamiliar, every detail is bracingly specific and real: a room in a snowbound country house, \u201cso quiet \u2026 it was like walking into a picture\u201d; a man with whiskers but no moustache so that \u201chis mouth sat in the middle of his face like an overripe fruit\u201d; a rose petal \u201cso soft I can\u2019t feel where it begins\u201d. Collins also masterfully conveys the interior life of her characters, particularly the altered states of love, and the book becomes truly spellbinding as Emmett is drawn vertiginously toward sexual love and its dazzling aftermath. \u201cThe moon itself beyond the latticed glass; a pearl caught in a net. I didn\u2019t even know who I was any more. I was new, I was a stranger \u2026 When I woke in the morning I lay there, incredulous, nearly blinded by it, holding on to the edge of the bed as if I was shipwrecked.\u201d</p> <p>In the second half, we\u2019re led through a series of plot twists that transform the central metaphor into something more profound. It turns out that binding is not just about selective amnesia, it\u2019s about how people can be compelled to forget the crimes of the powerful, and how sin is defined by enforced silence. It is society that makes it unsafe for us to fully know ourselves. Thus <em>The Binding</em> becomes a parable of \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d and the #MeToo movement, one that makes it clear that even our memories can be colonised. The victims of this arrangement, such as Emmett, are left in a permanent state of dissociation, with the feeling of being responsible for an unnamed crime for which they will never be forgiven.</p> <p>Many readers of <em>The Binding</em> will simply sink gratefully into the pleasures of its pages, because, like all great fables, it also functions as transporting romance. I once heard an author of young adult fiction being asked what her novel was about, and instead of explaining its adventure plot or sophisticated science- fiction premise, she said: \u201cKissing\u201d. This was clearly self-deprecation, but it was also an <em>aper\u00e7u</em> about the pleasure that draws readers to a huge array of books, from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jul/29/the-10-best-hunger-games-quotes-that-show-katnisss-strength\" title=\"\">The Hunger Games</a></em> to <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/31/rereading-anna-karenina-james-meek\" title=\"\">Anna Karenina</a></em>. <em>The Binding</em> is a kissing novel par excellence, and on this level, it is like a wonderful meal made from a few simple ingredients: the feeling in your chest when you hold someone in your arms for the first time; the sight of a host of bluebells.

      "bodyText": "Bridget Collins\u2019s fantasy novel, her first for adults, begins sombrely, with its teenage hero Emmett being sent away from his family farm to become an apprentice to a binder of books. He\u2019s weak after a long illness of a mysterious nature and, from his family\u2019s strained behaviour, we intuit that he\u2019s in some kind of disgrace he doesn\u2019t fully understand. When he arrives at the isolated house of Seredith, the elderly woman to whom he\u2019s apprenticed, it\u2019s both an exile and a haven. He spends his days learning to make endpapers, tool leather, gilding \u2013 the delicate physical labour of making beautiful books. But he soon realises that the true work of binding is magical, manifested in the way that lives are turned into stories. Distressed people arrive at Seredith\u2019s, asking to have their traumatic experiences put down on paper; once that is done, the memories are erased. They leave dulled but soothed, and in her cellar, Seredith keeps their secrets safe in gorgeous books with the subject\u2019s name on the spine. Of course, somewhere among them is a book with Emmett\u2019s name on it, which contains the secret of his disgrace. When Seredith dies, the books fall into unscrupulous hands, and Emmett is set on a path to recover his lost past. In many ways, The Binding is an unpretentious work of escapist fiction. The morality of the book is simple; the good are essentially noble and their enemies unambiguously wicked. The vaguely antiquated setting could as easily be Westeros or Hardy\u2019s Wessex. At the heart of the novel is a love story that develops along a familiar trajectory, from immediate dislike to inexplicable flutters of the heart to full infatuation with its feeling of being \u201cbreathless and dizzy, as if my blood was too thin\u201d. When the protagonists are happy, it\u2019s spring outdoors. When things go wrong, a wet snow falls. But while some elements are overfamiliar, every detail is bracingly specific and real: a room in a snowbound country house, \u201cso quiet \u2026 it was like walking into a picture\u201d; a man with whiskers but no moustache so that \u201chis mouth sat in the middle of his face like an overripe fruit\u201d; a rose petal \u201cso soft I can\u2019t feel where it begins\u201d. Collins also masterfully conveys the interior life of her characters, particularly the altered states of love, and the book becomes truly spellbinding as Emmett is drawn vertiginously toward sexual love and its dazzling aftermath. \u201cThe moon itself beyond the latticed glass; a pearl caught in a net. I didn\u2019t even know who I was any more. I was new, I was a stranger \u2026 When I woke in the morning I lay there, incredulous, nearly blinded by it, holding on to the edge of the bed as if I was shipwrecked.\u201d In the second half, we\u2019re led through a series of plot twists that transform the central metaphor into something more profound. It turns out that binding is not just about selective amnesia, it\u2019s about how people can be compelled to forget the crimes of the powerful, and how sin is defined by enforced silence. It is society that makes it unsafe for us to fully know ourselves. Thus The Binding becomes a parable of \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d and the #MeToo movement, one that makes it clear that even our memories can be colonised. The victims of this arrangement, such as Emmett, are left in a permanent state of dissociation, with the feeling of being responsible for an unnamed crime for which they will never be forgiven. Many readers of The Binding will simply sink gratefully into the pleasures of its pages, because, like all great fables, it also functions as transporting romance. I once heard an author of young adult fiction being asked what her novel was about, and instead of explaining its adventure plot or sophisticated science- fiction premise, she said: \u201cKissing\u201d. This was clearly self-deprecation, but it was also an aper\u00e7u about the pleasure that draws readers to a huge array of books, from The Hunger Games to Anna Karenina. The Binding is a kissing novel par excellence, and on this level, it is like a wonderful meal made from a few simple ingredients: the feeling in your chest when you hold someone in your arms for the first time; the sight of a host of bluebells. In recent years, the state of the world has threatened to make us forget the simple pleasures of kisses and bluebells and thick novels that tell stories of heartbreak. Here is a book to help us remember. \u2022 Sandra Newman\u2019s The Heavens will be published in May by Granta. The Binding is published by Borough.

      "bodyText": "More than half of Conservative party members want Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal to be rejected in favour of leaving the EU with no deal, according to a survey. The poll, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), found a majority of the Tory rank and file are convinced that leaving the EU without a deal is better than the prime minister\u2019s Brexit plan. In a three-way referendum, with the options of leaving without a deal, staying in the EU or leaving with May\u2019s deal, 57% preferred leaving without a deal. Only 23% of members said they would vote for May\u2019s deal in a three-way referendum. The findings were released on Friday by the ESRC-funded party members project, run from Queen Mary University of London and Sussex University. Just 29% of Tory members would vote for May\u2019s deal, compared with 64% who would vote to leave without a deal, if there was a two-option referendum. Among party members, opposition to the deal negotiated by their own leader outweighs support by a margin of 59% to 38%. More members (53%) think May\u2019s deal does not respect the 2016 EU referendum result than the 42% who think it does. The findings are a further blow to May, who hopes to win a majority in parliament for her EU deal, which is expected to be put to the vote later in January. In November, she appealed directly to the public in an attempt to put pressure on rebellious backbenchers to fall in line. The survey result will spur on a minority of MPs who want the UK to leave on World Trade Organization rules. It comes after the EU refused to hold further meetings to discuss May\u2019s Brexit deal, and as the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, warned no deal would become far more likely if MPs rejected the prime minister\u2019s proposals. Academics surveyed 1,215 ordinary Conservative party members, together with a representative sample of 1,675 voters. Prof Tim Bale, who led the research, said the findings showed No 10 could not depend upon constituency associations to persuade Tory MPs to back May\u2019s deal. \u201cThe Tory rank and file, it seems, are convinced that no deal is better than May\u2019s deal,\u201d he said. \u201cTory members\u2019 dislike for the PM\u2019s deal really comes out when we asked about a referendum in which the choice came down to her deal or no deal. \u201cOnly 29% of Tory members would vote for Mrs May\u2019s deal, compared to 64% who would vote to leave without a deal. \u201cBut that\u2019s as nothing to Conservative party members faced with a referendum offering just two choices \u2013 remain or no deal. Some 76% of Conservative party members would plump for no deal,\u201d he said. Bale suggested there were two specific issues behind the opposition to May\u2019s deal, the first being the Irish backstop. \u201cTory members have become convinced that the Irish backstop is a bad idea,\u201d he said, with 40% believing it was a reason to reject the deal, and 21% thinking it was irrelevant because May\u2019s deal \u201cis a bad one anyway\u201d. The second issue is 76% of members being sceptical about warnings that a no-deal Brexit would cause serious disruption, he said. \u201cTory members, like Tory voters, are utterly unconvinced, despite their own government\u2019s best recent efforts, that a no-deal Brexit would cause serious disruption. \u201cSome 72% of voters currently intending to support the Conservatives think the warnings are \u2018exaggerated or invented\u2019 \u2013 a figure that rises to 76% among Tory members. \u201cMeanwhile, those members are convinced by a margin of 64% to 19% that leaving without a deal would have a positive rather than a negative effect on Britain\u2019s economy in the medium to long term,\u201d he said. Nearly half (48%) of Conservative members think May is doing fairly badly or very badly as prime minister, and 44% think she should quit if parliament rejects her deal, he said. \u201cIn short, Mrs May has failed not only to convince the country, and quite probably parliament, that her Brexit deal is a good one, she has also failed to convince the party faithful,\u201d Bale said. The research showed that a greater proportion of Tory members think the government has made a mess of negotiating Brexit than those who just support the party. Among voters as a whole, 71% feel that the government has made a mess of negotiating Brexit, according to Bale\u2019s analysis. That figure drops to 56% among those currently intending to vote Conservative. But the poll of party members found that 68% of Tory members think the government is doing badly at negotiating the country\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 a proportion that rises to 78% of those party members who voted leave in 2016.",

Over after relentless run-scoring over went by before Virat Kohli finally put his hosts out of their misery with the tourists on a whopping 622-7. </p> <p>By that point Che Pujara had fallen narrowly short of a double-century, Rishabh Pant had galloped gleefully beyond 150, and Ravi Jadeja had bat-twirled his way to an entertaining 81. Records were obliterated. Australia were ground into the dust.</p> <p>India\u2019s show of strength has assured them of a series victory. All that remains is whether it is achieved by a margin of 2-1 or 3-1. This is a pitch with many more runs in it so taking 20 wickets over the next three days will not be easy. </p> <p>For the sake of morale Australia\u2019s batters need to make a fist of the task in hand. On the flipside there is the very real risk of the kind of crushing defeat that can send shockwaves through an administration. </p> <p>Geoff, Adam, and I will be back here tomorrow to see if India can continue their cakewalk.

The Big Three quicks are resting ahead of the Sri Lanka Tests, Pete Siddle one of those getting a chance to replace them, for his first ODIs since 2010 (!).

By my reckoning all 15 entries come exclusively from England or India. Is that simply a function of the number of series played, or the effect of a few stand-out individuals, or something else perhaps? India in particular have never won a series in Australia, yet claim 7 of the top 15 highest spots, whereas the West Indies I believe have won 4 series here, and don\u2019t feature at all...\u201d</p> <p>Not something I necessarily have time to unpack while doing the OBO, so please feel free to write in. Off the top of my head: yes, England have played far more series than anyone else, so have had more opportunities to get on the list. Also those series have been five or six Tests for a long time, where most countries visiting Aus play two or three. <br></p> <p>India did play some five-Test series, and even when it dropped to four they had that generation of prolific batsmen who went huge when they went big. West Indies is the big anomaly, as you say. Perhaps they won Tests by batting once, or didn\u2019t need more than about 200 themselves because they could bowl other teams out for 120?<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c2ea014e4b02fb91ff0dd7a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-03T23:54:55.676Z\">11.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>95th over: India 314-4 (Pujara 138, Vihari 41)</strong> Both batsmen are starting to drive Hazlewood confidently.

      "bodyText": "India\u2019s dominance over Australia was reinforced handsomely on day two in Sydney. Over after relentless run-scoring over went by before Virat Kohli finally put his hosts out of their misery with the tourists on a whopping 622-7. By that point Che Pujara had fallen narrowly short of a double-century, Rishabh Pant had galloped gleefully beyond 150, and Ravi Jadeja had bat-twirled his way to an entertaining 81. Records were obliterated. Australia were ground into the dust. India\u2019s show of strength has assured them of a series victory. All that remains is whether it is achieved by a margin of 2-1 or 3-1. This is a pitch with many more runs in it so taking 20 wickets over the next three days will not be easy. For the sake of morale Australia\u2019s batters need to make a fist of the task in hand. On the flipside there is the very real risk of the kind of crushing defeat that can send shockwaves through an administration. Geoff, Adam, and I will be back here tomorrow to see if India can continue their cakewalk. Your company is encouraged. 10th over: Australia 24-0 (Harris 19, Khawaja 5) Khawaja dabs out a maiden from Kuldeep to bring a momentous day for India to a close. \u201cThis is an awful way to wake up,\u201d emails David Kalucy. \u201cAre we just that bad or India just that good?\u201d Bit of both - not having access to the two best batsmen in the country is quite the impediment. \u201cIs the pitch really that dull that there be nothing at all for the bowlers or am I just saying \u201cstupid tool\u201d?.\u201d It is very flat, and the ball very stubborn. \u201cOn new year\u2019s day we had a Pirates Of The Caribbean marathon due to circumstances as it were, there is a moment when Kiera and Johnny are stuck on an island and she burns all the rum to attract the Navy who sure enough arrive and he comes out with something like \u201cthere will be no living with her now\u201d\u2026 in short Kohli is going to be insupportable. Cheers from the dummy spitters end.\u201d Cheers to you too. Although don\u2019t mention Johnny Depp around these parts. Final over of the day coming up. 9th over: Australia 24-0 (Harris 19, Khawaja 5) Jadeja effectively bowling like a left-arm medium pace away swing bowler this over, finding prodigious drift. The odd one dips the other way and hints at gripping but there is little on offer for the spinners. Khawaja defends resolutely before pinching the strike. 8th over: Australia 23-0 (Harris 19, Khawaja 4) Kuldeep Yadav makes it spin from both ends. Like Jadeja there\u2019s some handy drift through the air but nothing happening off the pitch. Khawaja still gets in a bit of a tangle though, opening his stumps and only just getting bat to one that slides on. 7th over: Australia 21-0 (Harris 18, Khawaja 3) An early look at spin with Jadeja brought into the attack. There\u2019s no rough yet for the bowler to target and consequently there\u2019s little to report from an over largely defended from the crease by Khawaja. Some nice drift away from the left-hander though, implying the ball is exiting Jadeja\u2019s hand in textbook fashion. 6th over: Australia 21-0 (Harris 18, Khawaja 3) A calmer over all round with Australia prioritising defence and Bumrah receiving no assistance in the air or off the pitch to anything full and failing to nail his bouncer. 5th over: Australia 18-0 (Harris 17, Khawaja 1) Khawaja gets off the mark before Harris continues his counterattack, placing Shami wide of mid-on for a couple, a stroke that prompts Kohli to remove third slip. This is Hayden-like enforcing from the Perth-born Victorian. 4th over: Australia 15-0 (Harris 15, Khawaja 0) Khawaja might be struggling but Harris looks in great touch. A couple of solid strokes find fielders before a firm drive to a ball offering a hint of width finds the fence just behind point. \u201cAs a non-Australian,\u201d emails Englishman Mike Vicars, \u201cI don\u2019t mind India batting on and on and reinventing the art of mental disintegration at its spiritual home. However, I am surprised to see that Starc has again had a bit of a disappointing run out, to go with a disappointing series. In your opinion, is he out of form or out of assistance from his fielders in, ahem, preserving the ball? Whilst his new ball overs seem menacing, he seems to have lost his magic in the middle overs. I may of course be completely underestimating the fact that India really know how to bat in a tough test match.\u201d A thought-provoking email Mike. I think it\u2019s a combination of all of the above, but yes, Australia\u2019s inability find reverse swing this summer has been noticeable. 3rd over: Australia 11-0 (Harris 11, Khawaja 0) DROPPED! Oh dear. That was a very catchable chance. Line and length from Shami draws Khawaja into an artless poke outside off that sends an edge flying between keeper and slip. The diving Pant gets both hands to it but they are hard hands and the ball crashes through the gloves. \u201cDreading the collective chest thumping of a country only so eager to weave this into some bogus \u2018triumph of the nation\u2019 sort of narrative,\u201d emails Abhinav Dutta. \u201cIt is slightly more obnoxious than Virat Kohli\u2019s demeanour.\u201d RIP my mentions. 2nd over: Australia 10-0 (Harris 10, Khawaja 0) Harris has come out with plenty of intent, and he continues his attacking mindset to Bumrah, earning two with a nice clip to the legside and three with a controlled edge down to third-man. Bumrah responds with a slippery short ball that Harris takes his eyes off, and not for the first time this series. This summer has been far from a clinic in how to evade bouncers. Rule one: keep your eyes on the ball at all times, has been broken repeatedly. Kevin Wilson is scarred. \u201cI know this Australian team is nowhere near as good but if there is one thing I have learned as an England cricket fan it\u2019s that you don\u2019t declare against them on 600-odd.\u201d 1st over: Australia 5-0 (Harris 5, Khawaja 0) Australia have ten overs to bat out tonight, India have three and a bit days to take 20 wickets. What are we going to see? Will Australia attempt the improbable? Will individuals simply be playing for their places? Mohammed Shami takes the new ball and he troubles Marcus Harris early with one that cramps him up. A little width later on is punished though, Harris cracking a fierce cut to get his side off and running. \u201cAt what point can India be officially classified as \u201ctaking the piss\u201d?\u201d asks Aditya Anchuri. Dan Liebke has the answer. \u201cMaybe this is Kohli\u2019s way of replying to Labuschagne\u2019s comments yesterday that they were two wickets away from breaking open Indian batting,\u201d emails Mandar Pathak. Lovely detail. Grant Moss is furious. \u201cOnly in Adelaide did we seem to have a pitch that offered something to the bowlers. This is not a test wicket, nor was Melbourne. Our bowlers aren\u2019t that bad - their figures are quite reasonable but the pitch is as flat as a tack. India has played the much better cricket by far and roundly deserve their success. As a cricket follower I am disgusted that we cannot provide a proper surface to ensure a contest. From day one it was clear that whoever won the toss would have a significant advantage. CA is too focussed on their money-spinner of T20 and have sacrificed the real game. Get rid of the lot of them.\u201d Jadeja\u2019s dismissal is the signal for Virat Kohli to invite Australia to bat and bring to a close one of the great Indian innings. The fun\u2019s over. Jadeja goes for one slog too many and Lyon hits the top of off. What a 204 run partnership that was. Bravo. 167th over: India 621-6 (Pant 158, Jadeja 81) Hazlewood pitches up, Pant tonks him through mid-off for four. Hazlewood drops short, Pant whacks him in front of square for four. Hazlewood lobs down a full toss, Pant stoops and bisects the legside boundary fielders. Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous batting. \u201cThe thing to do is to auction the toss,\u201d suggests Andrew Goudie. \u201cCaptains would have to bid a number of runs (perhaps in increments of 5 or 10 runs) to get any perceived advantage. If the winning bid is 30 runs, say, then the opposition starts at 30-0. It would be great fun, and exciting too.\u201d I am delighted by how enthusiastically this topic has taken off. 166th over: India 608-6 (Pant 145, Jadeja 81) Nathan Lyon returns for his 57th over. 57th! It\u2019s a tidy one in the circumstances, but still. \u201cI\u2019m glad someone else also finds this talk about declaration a bit crazy,\u201d emails Sedhupathy. \u201cIt\u2019s only the second day. And we are playing in Sydney, not Melbourne. Why not let the Indian bowlers enjoy another day of rest? Last I checked Nathan Lyon was going 150 plus. And it is not like the Indian batsmen are blocking everything.\u201d Oh to be an Indian fan right now... Drinks. Yes, back in 2010 the domestic one-day cup was a 45 over split-innings affair. The experiment lasted just the one season. 165th over: India 605-6 (Pant 142, Jadeja 81) Three singles from a comparatively sedate Hazlewood over. Scott Lennard has joined in the fantasy rule change conversation. \u201cInstead of a new ball every 80 overs: 0- New Ball 80- New Ball 120 - New Ball, but keep the existing ball with the umpire 160 - New ball, but can alternate between the retained old ball and the new ball each over should the bowler wish 200 - Another New Ball, continue old/new ball pattern 240- game ends in an automatic draw\u201d 164th over: India 602-6 (Pant 140, Jadeja 80) Cummins comes on to curtail Starc\u2019s brief new ball spell but he\u2019ll wish he hadn\u2019t. Jadeja lashes four glorious fours, each better than the last, in an over of rare excellence. The first was a swivel pull, the second and fourth legitimate pulls from dangerous lifters right in front of his moustache, while the third was a freely swung fairway wood back over the bowler\u2019s head. Never mind Pant\u2019s ton prompting a declaration, Jadeja is on for a milestone of his own. The over sees India beyond 600, and the partnership to the highest seventh-wicket stand ever in Tests at the SCG. ... the Australian dream. 163rd over: India 586-6 (Pant 140, Jadeja 64) Hazlewood into his 33rd over of the match and it contains a Marcus Harris misfield on the boundary to allow four runs to Jadeja. The bowler responds with a vicious bouncer, full of two days worth of pent up frustration, and it crashes into Jadeja\u2019s lid. The batsman is unharmed but a delay is inevitable while the helmet is exchanged. I like how Frank Breen thinks, but I\u2019m not sure the ICC will. \u201cYou could largely neutralise the toss advantage by alternating the batting side every 8 overs or 15 overs or whatever,\u201d he emails. \u201cI\u2019m sure this idea wouldn\u2019t catch on, especially for test cricket.Another possibility would to have two wickets, and let the visiting side choose which wicket.\u201d Has there ever been a cricket-baseball innings style trial? 162nd over: India 579-6 (Pant 139, Jadeja 60) Mitchell Starc does not look like he wants to be out there but he has to share the new ball. At least two runs arrive from the opening four balls of the over, a series that includes a sumptuous Jadeja four that rattles past the non-striker. \u201cNever mind about Lillee c Willey b Dilley... Where is \u2018The batsman\u2019s Holding, the bowler\u2019s Wiley\u2019?\u201d asks David Jenn. Here\u2019s as close as I can get. Apologies, it busts a few myths. 161st over: India 568-6 (Pant 139, Jadeja 51) \u201cAfternoon Jonathan,\u201d afternoon Phil Withall. \u201cKohli is my brother reincarnated. This is exactly the sort of merciless bullying I was subject to in pretty much every sport we played.\u201d Well, the joke maybe on Kohli (and by extension your brother) because Australia have access to a third new ball and they\u2019re not afraid to use it! Hazlewood has first go and he is adamant he has Pant LBW second ball - it looked plumb - but Richard Kettleborough keeps his finger down. Did he see an inside-edge? If not, that was very giveable, pitching in line, holding its line and... umpire\u2019s call on height. Hmmmm, Kettleborough wins the benefit of any doubt. Paine would doubtless have reviewed that decision had he any left, but it would have been to no avail. Pant rubs salt into the wound with a crunching cover drive to bring up the 150 partnership, a feat achieved at near five rpo. 160th over: India 563-6 (Pant 135, Jadeja 50) 50 to Jadeja, and out comes the sword twirling celebration. Pant allows him a couple of seconds in the spotlight before belting Lyon into the sightscreen for six. Brutal, unforgiving stuff from India. 159th over: India 555-6 (Pant 128, Jadeja 49) Pant reverse sweeps for four in a Head over that contains all the venom of a falling sycamore seed. I\u2019m not even sure all the players are even paying attention any more. Most of the crowd appear busy doing other things. India have every right to grind Australia into the dirt, but for the time being it is far from engrossing sport. 158th over: India 547-6 (Pant 122, Jadeja 47) Just the one run from Lyon\u2019s over. The GOAT has proven awkward to get away in recent minutes. Just over an hour left in the day, surely the declaration will arrive soon. Surely? \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s about winning the toss or more about batting first?\u201d emails Aditya Anchuri. \u201cMaybe batting first is more advantageous these days because sides rarely survive in the fourth innings?\u201d 157th over: India 546-6 (Pant 122, Jadeja 46) Five singles and a dot from Head\u2019s latest offering. This clip has been doing the rounds recently (and rightly so). Is there a possible contemporary equivalent? 156th over: India 541-6 (Pant 120, Jadeja 43) A couple more effortless singles for India with Lyon forced to bowl yet another over. Still no declaration. \u201cDear Jonathan, I can only assume Kohli is a Mozart fan and is waiting to run out of K\u00f6chel numbers. That would mean declaring at or after 626.\u201d I\u2019ll take your word for that Carl Rosman. 155th over: India 539-6 (Pant 119, Jadeja 42) Travis Head\u2019s turn to hurry-up the declaration now but his bowling is more haute cuisine than buffet and India have to make do with three singles. 154th over: India 536-6 (Pant 117, Jadeja 41) More runs for India, more pain for Lyon. The highlight of this run-filled over is a whipcrack sweep for four from Pant. Lyon now has 3/163 from 53 overs. \u201cHello Jonathan,\u201d hi Gervase Greene. \u201cFull marks to Pujara, Pant (especially) and the others, but at some point the elephant needs to be shown from the room, having first been acknowledged. This Test match, and this series, effectively ended the moment the coin landed on the deck at about 10:00am yesterday. Whether it\u2019s drop-in pitches, supposedly TV-friendly \u2018roads\u2019 to bat on, the Kookaburra, or the protocol of the toss itself, something must surely be done? One could almost wish a return to uncovered pitches, at least for the uncertainty that would provide...but global warming renders even that idea somewhat less effective. Congratters to India and all that, but I now find myself in the unfamiliar and uncomfortable position of actually looking forward to an ODI series.\u201d I wish I could bring it to your attention but there is a stat doing the rounds about the win percentage of sides winning the toss in recent times. If I recall correctly we are living through a golden age of matches won by teams winning the toss. Is it a statistical wrinkle that will iron itself out, or does something need to be done about it? I have no strong opinion... yet. 153rd over: India 528-6 (Pant 111, Jadeja 39) Khawaja\u2019s spell lasts just the one over but he may well do a better job than Labuschagne who returns to little effect. A rank over goes for 11, including a mown four from the centurion. 152nd over: India 517-6 (Pant 104, Jadeja 35) Khawaja\u2019s over was part of a plan to allow Lyon to swap ends. He almost snares a wicket with a mistimed drive almost reaching long-off but otherwise it\u2019s another over of accumulation. The declaration must be soon, surely? \u201cEric B is in my top 3 rhymers of all time, along with Biggie and either NAS or Posdnous,\u201d emails Daniel Guidone. \u201cIf we asked the Australian Selectors for a rapping line up, what would be get?\u201d I shudder to think. 151st over: India 513-6 (Pant 103, Jadeja 33) Good grief, we\u2019re into junk time now. Usman Khawaja comes on for just his second over in Test cricket (he has one first-class wicket, it must be said) but he begins with a real stinky full toss that is belted to the midwicket sweeper. The remainder of the over is only marginally better but India\u2019s batsman are unable to dish out significant punishment. Rarely have Australia ever been humiliated like this in international cricket. 150th over: India 510-6 (Pant 101, Jadeja 31) Aye aye! Pants wants his ton with a six, but he\u2019ll have to settle for one brought up with a four. Labuschagne\u2019s first delivery goes miles in the air but plugs behind mid-off. The second his hoicked through midwicket and the left-hander raises his willow to generous applause in recognition of his second Test century. \u201cNot sure about Will McCallum\u2019s assessment,\u201d emails Hugh Bartram. \u201cAs good as Pujara is I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be happy with my painter flicking the brush off the hip like he does.\u201d 149th over: India 503-6 (Pant 94, Jadeja 31) Pant displays his quick thinking at the start of Lyon\u2019s latest over. After first advancing down the track for the big heave-ho only to drill the ball into his boot, he responds next delivery by hanging back on his crease and cutting delicately behind point for three. This pair then exchange singles before a calamity almost befalls India\u2019s gloveman. Pant set off for a single that wasn\u2019t there, Jadeja wisely sent him back, a direct hit would have brought about a declaration but Handscomb failed with his shy and the near-centurion survives. He suffered a scuffed forearm in the process of diving though, which requires a little dressing. 148th over: India 498-6 (Pant 90, Jadeja 30) Labuschagne\u2019s shift extends to a 14th over and he\u2019s fortunate to only concede four runs during a set that includes a wild full toss outside off stump. Pant moves to 90, a new record for an Indian wicketkeeper in Australia. Before we forget the majesty of James Brown\u2019s Hot Pants, a note that it is one of those tracks that features as a sample in some form or other in a succession of belters, including this masterpiece of early hip hop from Eric B. &amp; Rakim. . 147th over: India 494-6 (Pant 89, Jadeja 27) Play has resumed at the SCG and it\u2019s business as usual for India. Both batsmen piercing gaps for singles during Nathan Lyon\u2019s 50th over. \u201cAs someone who has watched India chase leather for session after session when they play in Australia, the players looking plaintively at the pavilion for any sign of a declaration, wickets coming by about as frequently as Halley\u2019s comet, and the constant fear that Lara\u2019s record 375 was probably going to broken any minute now - all I can say is I am enjoying this beyond anything you can believe. Revenge is sweet alright.\u201d It\u2019s safe to say Sankaran Krishna is enjoying himself. And who can blame him, or any Indian supporter right now? Please keep me company over the next couple of hours, either on Twitter - @JPHowcroft- or by email - jonathan.howcroft.freelance@theguardian.com. In the meantime, and in honour of the star of today\u2019s play, here\u2019s James Brown. It\u2019s been another day of Indian domination. A day that ensures the visitors will depart Australian soil as series victors for the first time in their history. All that remains is whether they fly home with a 2-1 or 3-1 margin. This evening session promises to be full of entertainment (sorry Adam) as India\u2019s carefree lower order thrashes away before Virat Kohli calls them back to the pavilion. Thereafter Australia will be compelled to score at an ODI run-rate to stand any chance of salvaging a series draw. With Kohli spending the last hour or so of the afternoon session in his match whites it would appear a declaration is imminent. Pant\u2019s march to a century seemingly the key variable. 34 overs are left in the day which means we\u2019ll be finishing just shortly after the scheduled close of play, around two hours from now. Thank you very much Mr Collins, my favourite cricketing Adam since Adam Dale, a man who retired with 245 first-class wickets at an average of 20.75, a feat overshadowed by holding on to one of the all-time great catches. 146th over: India 491-6 (Pant 88, Jadeja 25) Travis Head! A new bowler for the 146th over - sure, why not. There\u2019s not a lot of interest in this set though, singles taken to the sweepers at point, long-on, long-off and backward point. Tea it is. Gosh, that was grim. Usually, I\u2019m a bit flat when my OBO stint is done. Not today. Hopefully, JP Howcroft can oversee something a fraction more lively after the break. Talk to you tomorrow! Bye! 145th over: India 487-6 (Pant 86, Jadeja 23) Might this be the final over? Starc will send it down. He nearly sneaks through the defence of Jadeja, finding his leg stump but not the woodwork. They are up again when he hits Pant\u2019s pad, but more a polite query than a full-blooded appeal. Pant takes one with the clock just on the cusp of 3:10pm local time, but they race around just in time to squeeze another in. 144th over: India 485-6 (Pant 85, Jadeja 22) Why aren\u2019t they trying to put Labuschagne on the moon at every available opportuninity? On the other hand, credit to the young leggie for the way he has bowled in this session. Character building, etc. 143rd over: India 481-6 (Pant 84, Jadeja 19) Shooooot! Pant nails a cover drive from the very middle of his blade, down to the boundary. Four more then comes off his front pad, deflected to the rope when Starc misfires to the legside. More runs to finish, Pant on the balls of his feet striking beautifully through point, albeit for three this time. He\u2019s entering the 80s faster than Elton John did. \u201cI find Pujara pretty tedious to watch,\u201d Will McCallum begins, \u201cbut the concentration is admirable. I reckon he\u2019d be good at painting a large room or hall without making mistakes.\u201d Good shout. He can do the feature wall in my new gaff. Cash in hand, of course. 142nd over: India 470-6 (Pant 77, Jadeja 19) Pant reverse sweeps Labuschagne again, albeit for one this time. For reasons best explained by Jadeja, he decides to defend the rest. Mitch Starc takes his hat off ready to bowl the next over, the Richies singing their hymn again about him being the new ball king. \u201cThe thing is,\u201d CricViz whiz kid Ben Jones says, \u201cStarc is notoriously better with the old ball.\u201d 141st over: India 469-6 (Pant 76, Jadeja 19) Who hits Pat Cummins for six? Ravi Jadeja does! Clearing the front leg, the southpaw picked his spot in the O\u2019Reilly Stand and nailed it, bringing up the 50-stand between these two in 66 deliveries. That\u2019s the fifth half-century partnership of the innings. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t but am still doing this,\u201d begins Ravi Raman. \u201cBut Vedic astrology also believed in a flat earth that rested on a tortoise.\u201d Maybe I\u2019ll hold off on that tea break reading. 140th over: India 458-6 (Pant 71, Jadeja 13) Labuschagne gives Lyon a break, much to the delight of Pant. It takes him a few balls to size up the leggie before launching into a reverse sweep, nailing the placement and timing down to the rope at backward point. \u201cI think India want 500 and to get out of there,\u201d former Australian spinner Gavin Robertson says on SEN\u2019s commentary, predicting a declaration from Kohli just after tea. In turn, Pant needs to move quick to secure a ton. Of that we can be sure. 139th over: India 453-6 (Pant 66, Jadeja 13) Jadeja\u2019s turn, making room to slap Cummins over backward point for another resourceful boundary! He has a second pop later in the over but doesn\u2019t make contact. With that, India now have 450 on the board. I suspect this is going to get worse before it gets better for Tim Paine. 138th over: India 448-6 (Pant 65, Jadeja 9) Oooh, this might be the start of the explosion, Pant jumping down at Lyon and slapping over cover inside-out for four. The timing wasn\u2019t sweet but the power and intent were enough to get the job done. 137th over: India 441-6 (Pant 59, Jadeja 8) Neither player is too worried about going after the short of a length deliveries this time around from Cummins, Pant cutting twice and Jadeja pulling around the corner, all for risk-free singles. It never ends for Australia. \u201cSharing your pain,\u201d wries Siddharth Vaidyanathan of the Pant non-selection in the ODIs. \u201cOddest prediction and I wonder what the odds are on this - Jadeja gets to 25 + Pant to 75 (both achieved ideally)... and THEN do we see ODI / T20 mode? 10 years from now, with no intent of blasphemy whatsoever, I figure that we will see marathon innings at the pace of a T20 innings in a test match. And it may become more common. For me, Sehwag was the origin of this kind of thinking. He deserves much of the credit, realised or not.\u201d I reckon he does. In Australia at least, where he\u2019s held in very high esteem. Sehwagology, as my colleague Jarrod Kimber dubbed it back in the day. 136th over: India 438-6 (Pant 57, Jadeja 7) Close again from Lyon to start, Pant taking him on down the ground but not getting all of it, just clearing the man at mid-off. The rest of the over is more convincing, three singles taken to the sweepers. 135th over: India 433-6 (Pant 53, Jadeja 6) Pat Cummins\u2019 turn to bang away from the Paddington End, replacing Hazlewood who did his job in helping build the pressure ahead of the Pujara dismissal. He finds the edge first ball to gully, just past where the man is stationed there. Jadeja has to do the usual dancing routine for the rest, getting out of the way of a couple of legit bouncers and another couple below the shoulders but still on track for his chest. He does it well. A quite outstanding email from Raja Mahraj, which I\u2019m going to reproduce in all its glory (with the exception of one line about September 11). \u201cVedic astrology talks of 60 year cycles when events repeat in a sense because Saturn and Jupiter return to same zodiac house. So 1929 market crash repeats in 1987 crash 59 years. Now 1959 India register first test win against Aussies of Richie Benaud in Kanpur. I was just 9 then and rejoiced. Fast forward 60 years to 2019 I am rejoicing as India on threshold to win 3-1 test series down under first time. Get it Steve you all who all live in caves like a frog and mock at Vedic astrology don\u2019t you, the smuggish thinking you know it all when in fact you don\u2019t.\u201d We\u2019ve been told! I now have my tea break wikipedia reading sorted. This was very good just before Pujara fell, by the way. Trent Copeland has been a fantastic addition to the coverage this year, a great get by Seven. 134th over: India 432-6 (Pant 52, Jadeja 6) During the break, The Richies were given a big run on the scoreboard singing a Christmas carol saying that Mitch Starc is the \u2018new ball king.\u2019 Well, they are only 27 overs from the third new ball, so there is that coming. Lyon to Pant after the breather, who again takes a single from the first ball of a new over, down the ground this time. Jadeja builds on his start, with two more to midwicket. 133rd over: India 429-6 (Pant 51, Jadeja 4) Pant is off strike first ball to cover, Jadeja then popping two into the legside for a couple before leaving the rest, the customary pair of bouncers in there. With that, drinks are called. 132nd over: India 426-6 (Pant 50, Jadeja 2) Jadeja gives the strike back to Pant early in the Lyon over, who clips one to midwicket to bring up his half-century in 85 deliveries. When he went to his maiden Test ton at The Oval in September, the left-hander exploded after reaching 50. Now, batting with the first of the bowlers (albeit a very good player in Jadeja), he\u2019ll surely do the same again here shortly. \u201cI realise that Pujara and Kohli are the main game along with the amazing Jasprit Bumrah,\u201d emails Gervase Greene. \u201cBut just how good is Rishabh Pant? (Rhetorical, that). He\u2019s barely a grown-up, but whether batting, bantering, baby-sitting or keeping he seems to do it all. And in great spirit. For sheer \u2018watchability\u2019 he is a real find.\u201d Aakash Chopra was just on telly saying that Saha, a much better wicketkeeper at this stage, will struggle to get back into the Indian XI now that Pant has done so well with the bat. Could there be room for both? Having watched Pant play some absurd IPL innings, I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s not in the mix as a specialist bat in the ODI squad. 131st over: India 424-6 (Pant 49, Jadeja 1) Pant may have a new partner but his intent has not changed, getting inside a short ball from Hazlewood to help himself to a four to fine leg, taking him to within one of his half-century. Earlier in the over, Jadeja was off the mark with a hard-run single to midwicket. This should be fun. Lyon has done it! After two excellent overs, Pujara advances to the final ball from the spinner and returns a straightforward catch. The end of the most mighty hand across 373 balls, denied a third double against Australia by just seven runs. Stand and applaud. 130th over: India 418-6 (Pant 44) 129th over: India 417-5 (Pujara 193, Pant 43) Hazlewood vs Pujara, starting outside the off-stump before banging in short, hitting Pujara on the elbow. He takes a moment to compose himself - that stung him a bit. Sure enough, Hazlewood bumps him again to finish. \u201cA Selfish of Adams?\u201d suggests Adam Hirst, neatly linking together a couple of themes. Nicely bowled. I just want milestones, Ads (I\u2019ve never called anyone that before and hate it when people use it for/at me). Welcome to my brain. 128th over: India 417-5 (Pujara 193, Pant 43) Two probing overs in a row from Lyon, Pant unable to get far from his crease in defence. Trying to make something from the final ball, he misses a cut close to his body, similar to the error he brought from Pujara in his previous over. \u201cThis instant Twitter, elegant email malarkey and fast T20 stuff undermines the slow unfolding beauty of Test cricket,\u201d writes Simon Richards. \u201cI shall pen, in cursive, a letter to arrive via boat to reach you approx August 2019. (Spoiler alert: Even with those unsavoury Smith &amp; Warner chaps I would suggest 3 - 1).\u201d It\u2019s going to take a lot to go right for Australia to win an Ashes Test next year. 127th over: India 417-5 (Pujara 193, Pant 43) Hazlewood is back to replace Labuschagne from our press box end and Pant enjoys the extra pace, flicking off his pads and to the rope at fine leg. Can be make it to tea? He grabs another one, also along the ground, his half-century nearing. Pujara deals with the rest in his usual way. 126th over: India 412-5 (Pujara 193, Pant 38) DROPPED CATCH! It\u2019s about as hard as a chance comes for a first slip with an offie bowling, Pujara cutting hard off the edge so Khawaja only had time to throw his right hand at it. It doesn\u2019t stick. In response, Pujara calmly takes a single from the next ball, Pant doing likewise through midwicket. That hurts. Had he pulled it in, comparisons would have been made to this. Related: there will be no Test at Hobart next year as Pakistan aren\u2019t deemed worthy of a third. Sigh. 125th over: India 410-5 (Pujara 192, Pant 37) Pujara creams a Labuschagne long hop to the boundary in front of the members at midwicket, with it moving into the 190s. He defends the rest until the final ball, which he cuts to the sweeper at deep point. Before lunch, I was talking up the prospect of Pujara going to a triple ton in this innings. Selfishly, as I\u2019ve never seen one of those raised in the 109 Tests I\u2019ve attended. 124th over: India 405-5 (Pujara 187, Pant 37) Another three singles through the legside without risk. There\u2019s not a lot going on for Lyon here in this spell after lunch. 123rd over: India 402-5 (Pujara 185, Pant 36) Another close call for Pant, this time nearly holing out to Hazlewood at long-on. The big quick, into his fifth session out there bowling, made plenty of territory but he couldn\u2019t quite reach the ball with his dive. Labuschagne is landing his deliveries consistently now, attacking the stumps so he\u2019s in the game, even if the Indian pair are taking relatively easy singles along the way. \u201cIf there was ever a time to cash in during a Test Match it is now,\u201d says Ricky Ponting of Rishabh Pant, urging the Indian \u2018keeper to kick on. 122nd over: India 398-5 (Pujara 183, Pant 34) Pant gets off strike first ball of the Lyon over, easing a full ball down the ground. Pujara does the rest, playing mostly with his pad outside the line of the off stump. \u201cG\u2019day Adam, following from chilly Seoul.\u201d Hello Will Arnold, great to have you with us. \u201cSurely it\u2019s got to be an embarrassment of Richies?\u201d Verrrrry good. I was thinking an insufferable, but you\u2019ve nailed it in one. As a nation, we really are no good at this stuff. 121st over: India 397-5 (Pujara 183, Pant 33) Run out chance! Pant was on the way down the track for a single from the final ball but Pujara sent him back. Had the throw been on target from the bowler Labuschagne, he was in real strife. Not to be. 120th over: India 396-5 (Pujara 183, Pant 32) I should say before we get too far into this that, if you are new to the OBO, you can be part of it by dropping me your emails and tweets at any time. Three singles off this Lyon over too, tucked, driven and pushed to the sweepers. Ricky Ponting is talking about the ODI squad on TV and noting that Maxwell is better than a part-time spinner in 50-over cricket. Given he was the man Australia used as their number one tweaker in their successful 2015 campaign, it was always odd how little Steve Smith used him with the ball when he was in charge. 119th over: India 393-5 (Pujara 182, Pant 30) Labuschagne continues his spell from before the break, turning one early in the over in the direction of Pant\u2019s inside edge, which isn\u2019t for nothing with a short leg fielder in place. That straight line of attack does allow easy singles to be taken as well, three of them before the over is complete. 118th over: India 390-5 (Pujara 181, Pant 28) I don\u2019t know why I thought Lyon was bowling from our end. Of course, he\u2019s operating at the Randwick End, as is the custom for tweakers at the SCG. His first over is accurate enough, Pant defending until the final ball when he has enough room to cut one. Between overs, The Richies are singing Waltzing Matilda. Can I get a few collective noun options for The Richies? They were belting out a beer commercial over and over before lunch, which guarantees we\u2019ll have 72 renditions of the national anthem coming our way from them after tea. [Christopher Walken] The players. Are back. On the field! [/Christopher Walken] One Australia not striding out is David Warner, but he was talking in Bangladesh earlier today about his growth away from the side. There are reports in the paper today that he could be up for a cool million to flog the full Sandpaper story (via book or interview) when the time comes. Won\u2019t that be fun! Back in the middle, it is Nathan Lyon bouncing away from us to begin from the Paddington End, bowling at Rishabh Pant (28) with Che Pujara (181) down the other end. India are resuming on 389-5. PLAY! I arrive with news. Of an Australian ODI squad, announced in the lunch break. I see that Geoff has given you a true Geoffing at the end, numbers everywhere for us to watch in the upcoming session, but back to those in a moment. This is the group of 14 that will attempt to avoid losing by an innings to India in any of their three ODIs this month: Aaron Finch (c) (Victoria) Usman Khawaja (Queensland) Shaun Marsh (Western Australia) Peter Handscomb (Victoria) Glenn Maxwell (Victoria) Marcus Stoinis (Western Australia) Mitch Marsh (vc) (Western Australia) Alex Carey (vc) (South Australia) Jhye Richardson (Western Australia) Billy Stanlake (Queensland) Jason Behrendorff (Western Australia) Peter Siddle (Victoria) Nathan Lyon (New South Wales) Adam Zampa (South Australia) So, from that. Chris Lynn and D\u2019Arcy Short have been punted, Travis Head and Ashton Agar too. I\u2019m pleasantly surprised that Glenn Maxwell has been retained - probably a stay of execution ahead of the World Cup. The Big Three quicks are resting ahead of the Sri Lanka Tests, Pete Siddle one of those getting a chance to replace them, for his first ODIs since 2010 (!). Mitch Marsh and Nathan Lyon are also back in canary yellow. What do you make of that? Do you think they have the right balance here to once again win the 2015 World Cup on home soil? Back to back, baby! 2015! 2015! 2015! India\u2019s session. India\u2019s day. India\u2019s match. India\u2019s year, so far. And India\u2019s series, surely, inevitably. One wicket in the session, with Hanuma Vihari dismissed, but Pujara has sailed serenely on. Pant has given him faultless support so far (and isn\u2019t that what we all want from our Pants.) Nathan Lyon and Mitch Starc have already gone for over 100, with two wickets for Lyon and one for Starc. Hazlewood has the best figures with 2-65 but hasn\u2019t looked too dangerous bar the odd beaten edge. Cummins is wicketless thus far. In terms of balls faced in Australia-India contests, Pujara has only three players ahead of him, each from series with five or six Tests. Two of them we don\u2019t know the exact number due to incomplete scorecards, but Allan Border faced 1219+ and Kim Hughes 1269+ on Australia\u2019s visit to India in 1979, while David Boon leads with 1552 from India\u2019s visit in 1991-92. If Pujara gets to 1552, he\u2019ll break this Australian team forever. Right now he\u2019s on 1217, and poised to at least move to second on that list in the coming session. As for runs, he\u2019s third on the list of visiting batsmen to Australia in a series of four Tests or fewer. Pujara 509 to Dravid with 619 and Kohli with 692. He\u2019s tenth on the list for runs within the first four Tests of a series (that could go longer than four Tests). And he\u2019s 17th on the all-time list for runs by a visiting batsman to Australia in any series, where most of those above him are from Ashes series with five or six Tests. Those are the numbers: if he keeps going, there\u2019ll be more to fall. I\u2019ll leave you to count the bottles off the wall with Adam Collins, and I\u2019ll be back with you to bring up Pujara\u2019s 400 tomorrow morning. 117th over: India 389-5 (Pujara 181, Pant 27) Labuschagne closes out the session with three singles, and that will be that. SH writes in having noted Harsha Bhogle\u2019s comment that Pujara has now batted more time in the series than a five-day Test. \u201cThis amuses me,\u201d writes SH. \u201cPujara batting for five day just for the hell of it.\u201d He might just do it here at the SCG. 116th over: India 386-5 (Pujara 180, Pant 25) Lyon continues, and Pujara helps him around the corner for four more. Equals Rahul Dravid\u2019s famous score against Australia from Kolkata in 2001. This should be a children\u2019s story book from Mahendra Killedar. \u201cI have got a grasshopper theory for Vihari\u2019s misfortune with DRS. You see lot of green between ball as it passes bat. That must be the naughty insect kissing the bat!\u201d 115th over: India 380-5 (Pujara 175, Pant 24) Poor old Marnus Labuschagne. He\u2019s on to bowl nine minutes before lunch. He\u2019s absolutely being used like the classic part-timer, a sneaky over before a break to try to disrupt the batsman\u2019s concentration. Not being treated as a legitimate part of the bowling plans. At least he keeps this over tighter than yesterday, only conceding three. Pujara has just gone past the all-time record for balls faced in a four-Test series between these countries. In that 2003-04 series where they were so closely matched, Ricky Ponting faced 1201 balls and Rahul Dravid faced 1203. Pujara is at 1208 and counting. 114th over: India 377-5 (Pujara 174, Pant 22) Four runs from Lyon\u2019s over. A belated appeal from the bowler after Pant almost misses a sweep, but he got something on it. And a couple of runs from the ricochet off his pad. 113th over: India 373-5 (Pujara 173, Pant 19) A false shot from Pujara as Hazlewood bowls a slower ball. Spoons it away on the off side, but it lands safely for two runs. Tom Cameron is in our inbox with a worthy discussion point. \u201cWe\u2019re discussing here whether the current focus each day in the papers on what Australia\u2019s precise batting order should be is getting a little weird. Or at least acutely disproportionate. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, whether Khawaja is opening or staying at 3 makes little difference at present (when our openers are pretty unreliable). Whether M Marsh or T Paine walks out at 6 or 7 \u2013 does it really make a difference? Don\u2019t we need to focus far more on straight up form, and who is showing a preparedness to bat in a sensible, level headed way? Where exactly they bat in the order is not quite the issue. Can they face it in test conditions? Are they reliable in technique? Are they the sort of character we can see in the team in the long run? (England and beyond). They are the only real questions surely. \u201cThe intense focus by many on where exactly our mob sit in the order is like giving Scott Morrison a comeback plan based on where his ministers sit on the Treasury benches during question time. Your thoughts?\u201d 112th over: India 371-5 (Pujara 171, Pant 19) Lyon to Pant, cut away for a single. Lyon has dropped short a fair bit this morning. Pujara helps one around the corner for three. That double hundred is looming. \u201cBorrowing a phrase I first came across in context of Welsh rugby in the late \u201880s,\u201d writes Paddy Davies, \u201cwatching Australia play cricket is like intruding on a nation\u2019s private grief.\u201d 111th over: India 367-5 (Pujara 168, Pant 18) Hazlewood on for Starc, who just wasn\u2019t right this morning. There\u2019s a weary and jaded tread to Josh H, I have to say. He looked sore and tired chasing to the boundary earlier. No surprise given the long shifts at Melbourne and the short turnaround into another two days of bowling here. Bouncer, yorker, ball past the edge, and no love. The Hazlewood 2018-19 story. 110th over: India 367-5 (Pujara 168, Pant 18) Three singles from the Lyon over, comfortably collecting without trying to overdo it. Pant is still keeping his cool. \u201cThey\u2019ve been brilliant, haven\u2019t they?\u201d writes SH of the umpiring. \u201cDon\u2019t remember too many decisions getting overturned.\u201d True, and they\u2019ve got some very skinny ones correct. 109th over: India 364-5 (Pujara 166, Pant 17) Starc tries the yorker again, but only hits Pant\u2019s pad and flies away for four leg byes. A couple of singles follow. The runs keep coming. \u201cGeoff, I must apostrophise your pant pun with apostrophe. Not possible if misused.\u201d Thank you, Antony Ransome. For those unacquainted, apostrophise: to \u201caddress an exclamatory passage in a speech or poem\u201d. If you\u2019d like a further example of why apostrophes are their ilk can matter, see below. 108th over: India 358-5 (Pujara 165, Pant 16) Pujara is making it look so easy. Works the ball to leg a couple of times, straight to the field, but the last ball of the over Lyon gives him width, and Pujara immediately changes his line of attack to cut behind point for four. 107th over: India 353-5 (Pujara 161, Pant 15) Starc attempts the yorker at 151 kph. Just overpitches. Pant is doing the hornpipe to get his feet out of the way of the very low full toss, but gets enough on it to send it down the ground. It rolls and rolls and teases Hazlewood all the way into the rope. 106th over: India 346-5 (Pujara 160, Pant 9) Huge appeal, and Australia will go upstairs again. Pant swishes outside off stump and Lyon\u2019s ball misses the top edge. There was a noise, you can hear a click as the ball goes past on the stump mics. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything. You guys know,\u201d says Lyon. Khawaja at slip says \u201cThat\u2019s out.\u201d Paine reviews. But there\u2019s nothing on DRS or Snicko, and it seems like a sliver of daylight between ball and bat. The noise must have come from somewhere else. More frustration, and Australia have now lost both reviews. 105th over: India 345-5 (Pujara 160, Pant 8) Mitchell Starc, ladies and gentlemen, is getting smashed. Pujara is the more attacking player right at the moment, and cover drives gorgeously for four. Starc comes over the wicket to the left-handed Pant, and produces the same result in mirror image, that ball so well struck it flew to the rope where plenty of others have limped. A single to each batsman means 10 from the over. 104th over: India 335-5 (Pujara 155, Pant 3) A maiden from Nathan Lyon to Rishabh Pant. Now I\u2019ve seen everything. (\u201cOh really? Have you ever seen a man eat his own head? Well then you haven\u2019t seen everything.\u201d) Pant plays a couple of shots to the field, but otherwise defends and leaves. Wonder if he made a New Year\u2019s resolution to stop holding out for 24 from 18 balls. Ruth wishes to clarify that her former post was indeed satirical, and she\u2019d like to wager that Pujara will be the not-out batsman. Safe shout. 103rd over: India 335-5 (Pujara 155, Pant 3) Right. Pants on, everybody. Pant\u2019s on. Off the mark immediately as he deals with Starc\u2019s yorker. Then dabs a single. Pujara adds another couple on the glance. Now it\u2019s time for drinks. 102nd over: India 329-5 (Pujara 152) Down the track he comes to Lyon, shimmying as he did all yesterday, and drives with a flourish out through cover for four. The tumbling save out on the rope saves nothing. And another milestone comes up for Pujara, his biggest hundred of the series by a distance now. But when he swaps strike, Vihari is out to the last ball of the over. Finally the breakthrough for Lyon. Vihari goes for the sweep, gets the faintest top edge, into his bicep, and flexed away to short leg. Vihari didn\u2019t think he hit it, and reviewed immediately, but Snicko found the faintest flicker. More evidence that \u201cyou always know when you\u2019ve hit it\u201d is self-confirming tosh. 101st over: India 324-4 (Pujara 147, Vihari 42) Starc on to complete a double change. Did I mention that Che likes the cut shot? Short, wide, dross, boshed. Starc gets the line better, and later in the over almost has Vihari playing onto his stumps. Got his legs in the way, luckily for the batsman. 100th over: India 319-4 (Pujara 142, Vihari 42) Lyon on for a trundle. Vihari blocks out the over watchfully. Checking for any turn or bounce from this surface. Doesn\u2019t look threatening yet. Abramowitz tips Pujara for 253. Geoff Wignall for 177. And the pool is closed. 99th over: India 319-4 (Pujara 142, Vihari 42) Pujara has been sharp on the threes today. Gets another from Hazlewood off his pads, thereby sadly knocking Josh (not Hazlewood) out of the running for the pool before even getting started. \u201cPujara to fall for 139 top edging a reverse sweep. It\u2019s later revealed this was part of a bet with fellow jokester and bloke who thinks it\u2019s important to remember cricket\u2019s just a game, Virat Kohli.\u201d 98th over: India 315-4 (Pujara 139, Vihari 41) Pujara finally takes a run from Cummins via a cut shot. Moves his score on to 139. So then. Pujara Party. Pool Party. Pujara Pool Party. Andrew Benton has gone for 192. \u201cI think he\u2019ll have a brainstorm in a little bit.\u201d You think he\u2019ll put some butcher\u2019s paper up on the wall and get out the felt-tip markers and write up some ideas? Real blue-sky thinking? What if we had no budgetary constraints? What do we stand for as an organisation? What brings us joy, and how can we best bring joy to others? Worthy stuff. Gerard is going with 198. Paul has 401. 97th over: India 314-4 (Pujara 138, Vihari 41) Another maiden, as the waiting game continues. Vihari has not yet decided that he\u2019d rather play Hungry Hungry Hippos. He has to play at four Hazlewood deliveries, but all defensive strokes. \u201cHi Geoff. These guys need to be bounced out methinks.\u201d I do hope that\u2019s satirical, Ruth, after what we saw yesterday morning. 96th over: India 314-4 (Pujara 138, Vihari 41) Another Cummins maiden to Pujara. Jono Maher has a very interesting question. \u201cI wonder if that list of top visiting run-scorers against Australia warrants some unpacking? By my reckoning all 15 entries come exclusively from England or India. Is that simply a function of the number of series played, or the effect of a few stand-out individuals, or something else perhaps? India in particular have never won a series in Australia, yet claim 7 of the top 15 highest spots, whereas the West Indies I believe have won 4 series here, and don\u2019t feature at all...\u201d Not something I necessarily have time to unpack while doing the OBO, so please feel free to write in. Off the top of my head: yes, England have played far more series than anyone else, so have had more opportunities to get on the list. Also those series have been five or six Tests for a long time, where most countries visiting Aus play two or three. India did play some five-Test series, and even when it dropped to four they had that generation of prolific batsmen who went huge when they went big. West Indies is the big anomaly, as you say. Perhaps they won Tests by batting once, or didn\u2019t need more than about 200 themselves because they could bowl other teams out for 120? 95th over: India 314-4 (Pujara 138, Vihari 41) Both batsmen are starting to drive Hazlewood confidently. Can he use this against them? Vihari picks up two and then one, Pujara another three. What\u2019s the pool on Pujara\u2019s score today? I\u2019m tipping 232. Nominations close after the 100th over. Closest to the pin. 94th over: India 308-4 (Pujara 135, Vihari 39) Cummins in contrast takes the Route 1 approach, attacking the body. He\u2019s got that leg gully in again, trying to replicate the dismissal of Pujara from Melbourne. Slightly different circumstances though this time around, and Pujara is happy not to score. We might as well crack into the politics of the day, via Bill May. \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t play for NSW\u2019 used to be the lament of fine cricketers not selected in the Australian team. Now it\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m not the kind of bloke the selectors are looking for.\u2019 Time to remove politics from the selection process as in the PM\u2019s assurance, \u2018Have a go and you\u2019ll get a go.\u2019\u201d Not sure that Kirribilli is where I\u2019d be looking for pointers on stable administrative process right at the moment, but the sentiment largely holds. 93rd over: India 308-4 (Pujara 135, Vihari 39) Hazlewood, first thing in the morning, with a ball that\u2019s still fairly new. This is how he did in England in Adelaide a year and a bit ago. How much longer it seems... He beats Vihari with a good ball, but Australia\u2019s bowlers have done a lot of that this series, and far less dismissing anyone. Hazlewood can\u2019t change that, even as he chisels away just outside off stump. Vihari\u2019s discipline holds. 92nd over: India 308-4 (Pujara 135, Vihari 39) Pat Cummins will start the day: Simon Atkinson will be happy. \u201cLong time reader, first time caller. Having a particularly busy morning at work and knocked up this masterpiece (attached) for a group chat, but hoping it\u2019s an omen for Cummins bring the spice (cumin?) to India today. Not sure I\u2019ve got the meme right, but... I\u2019m too old to understand memes. Thanks for the commentary yesterday, looking forward to a good morning of cricket for either team.\u201d Pujara blocks out the over tamely enough, bar two runs off his pads. 91st over: India 306-4 (Pujara 133, Vihari 39) And we\u2019re away. Hazlewood with the first ball, defended, then the second ball, driven nicely by Pujara through covers for three. The bat twisted on impact there, but it was nice decisive footwork from the overnight batsman to get to the line of that ball. Vihari is tucked up on his stumps and tries to punch into the gap at point, but can\u2019t beat the field. It\u2019s Day 2, so the Richies are out in force. Gathering at the pub across the road before the game as I walked in. Already in good voice. Though drunkenly yelling at passing cars at 9:30 in the morning wasn\u2019t exactly the vibe that the great man exuded, if I\u2019m bluntly honest. Let\u2019s see how they go in the stands today. And while we finish our morning Pujara Party, why not take some of the 25 minutes before play to read my piece from last night, in which I got to cite some beautifully accidental modern Australian poetry from South Australia bowler Nick Benton. While Ric Finlay is doing the business (he\u2019s the ABC statto, and one of the best in the world), how\u2019s this for a number? This gives a good sense of Pujara\u2019s series. Dominant in terms of decent scores per innings, but nothing gargantuan. Currently 15th on this list, though he could vault up a fair few places today. Plus a second innings if necessary. As always, drop me a line. We\u2019ve had a fair bit of fun with the readers this series, who\u2019ve come out of the woodwork more and more as the Tests have gone on. Find me on Twitter if that\u2019s your bag, or use the old and elegant email: geoff.lemon@theguardian.com. Good morning, good evening, good crepuscular stroll, good whatever time of day or night it is in your locale. Perhaps you\u2019re orbiting in a satellite and the very concepts of day and night are now irrelevant? In which case, welcome, space family! And a salute for your post-atmospheric bravery. It is Cheteshwar Pujara day at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Three hundreds so far in this four-Test series, but he hasn\u2019t made a monster. And he, like Dr Frankenstein before him, loves making monsters. Then suggesting to us by reflection that perhaps the real monster was within us all along? Che Pu is on 130, he has the No6 Hanuma Vihari for company, he has the wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant and the all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja to come, before the batting thins out down the order, and he has a pretty nice batting surface to operate on. So today could be all his. He could carpe the hell out of that diem. Alternatively, Australia desperately need to knock him over early. India have passed 300 already, and that already looks very challenging for Australia\u2019s struggling line-up. No time to waste.",

Merritt and other local activists noted that the shooting is eerily similar to another shooting that occurred 16 months prior on a nearby stretch of highway. In that incident, 21-year-old A\u2019Vonta Williams and his girlfriend\u2019s grandmother were seriously injured when another driver, also described as a white man in a pickup truck pulled up next to their vehicle and began firing. In both cases, all of the occupants of the cars fired on were black. Months after the incident, in a 2017 interview with the Houston Chronicle, Williams said that the authorities who interviewed him after that shooting were more interested in blaming him than finding the attacker. \u201cThe police got there and they were just asking: \u2018Who got shot and who I was beefing with? What did I do? Who did I rob?\u2019\u2019 said Williams. \u201cThey just kept asking questions, like, making me feel like I had done something bad.\u201d Sheriff Gonzalez later visited Williams and apologized that he was \u201ctreated less than he needed to be treated\u201d, but the case remains unsolved. Law enforcement has provided no indication that the two shootings are in any way connected. The two shootings occurred six miles and 18 months apart, and the driver in each case was driving a different pickup truck. Still, Houston-area activist Deric Muhammad can\u2019t help but draw a direct line and wonders if Williams\u2019s shooting were solved, \u201cwould Jazmine Barnes still be alive?\u201d \u201cWhat are the odds that two black families were fired upon by a white male in a pickup truck within a one-year time span on the same block? We\u2019ve got to call it what it is. Black people are being targeted in this country,\u201d Muhammad told the Houston Chronicle. Gonzalez said his office was \u201cnot ruling anything out\u201d, but that it would be \u201cirresponsible\u201d to claim race was a factor in the attack \u201cwithout fully knowing that is the linkage\u201d.",

      "body": "<h2>Top story: \u2018Children become addicted to likes\u2019</h2> \n<p>Hello, here we are on a Friday morning. I\u2019m Warren Murray and these are the stories on the agenda today.</p> \n<p>Social media is fuelling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/04/depression-in-girls-linked-to-higher-use-of-social-media\">sharply higher rates of depression among girls than boys</a>, a study that interviewed almost 11,000 14-year-olds has found. As many as three-quarters of 14-year-old girls who suffer from depression also have low self-esteem and are unhappy with how they look. Greater daily hours of social media use corresponds to an increase in depressive symptoms, explained Professor Yvonne Kelly from University College London, as well as poor sleep.</p> \n<p>Anne Longfield, the children\u2019s commissioner for England, warned that even some children as young as nine \u201care becoming almost addicted to \u2018likes\u2019 as a form of social validation that makes them happy\u201d. Shannon McLaughlin, 18, from Blackburn, who was diagnosed with anxiety and depression in her early teens, said: \u201cPeople mostly share the positive things about life on social media, without showing the negatives \u2026 Seeing that everyone was happy and enjoying life made me feel so much worse.\u201d Barbara Keeley, the shadow minister for mental health, said social media firms should be forced to adopt a duty of care to protect young users.</p> \n<p>Separately this morning, paediatricians are saying that screen time is not inherently bad for children, but parents do need to focus on making sure their children get enough sleep, exercise and family interaction. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has produced guidance including a checklist for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/04/screen-time-not-intrinsically-bad-for-children-say-doctors\">whether your family\u2019s screen time is under control</a>.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Pelosi back in the chair \u2013 </strong>Democrats have reclaimed power in the US House of Representatives from the Republicans and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/03/democrats-government-shutdown-congress-legislation\">elected Nancy Pelosi back to the speaker\u2019s position</a> that she was the first woman in history to hold. Pelosi swore into office the 116th Congress, which includes a record 102 women. \u201cOur nation is at a historic moment,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo months ago, the American people spoke and demanded a new dawn.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5ae8a99b-22ac-477a-9b2a-b5ee5734d0a9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P8QWY8iBRxs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In their first act since taking back control, Democrats last night tested their power by passing legislation to end the near fortnight-long government shutdown. Donald Trump has pledged to veto the bill \u2013 which ignores his demands for billions of dollars for a border wall \u2013 but it sets the tone for what is expected to be a tumultuous final two years of the president\u2019s first term. Republicans still have control of the Senate. Pelosi had to counter Democratic calls for generational change to regain the speaker\u2019s chair. Fifteen of her own party voted against her.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Police plan for Brexit hard border \u2013 </strong>Almost 1,000 police officers from England and Scotland will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/03/police-reinforcements-for-northern-ireland-in-case-of-no-deal-brexit-1000-officers-training-trouble-hard-border\">train for deployment in Northern Ireland in case a no-deal Brexit causes disorder along the Irish border</a>, the Guardian has learned. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said the Republic was also making serious preparations and reiterated there could be no EU renegotiation with Britain. University leaders say a no-deal Brexit poses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/04/universities-raise-alarm-over-no-deal-brexit-and-eu-student-enrolment\">\u201cone of the biggest threats\u201d ever faced by the sector</a>, which contributes over \u00a32bn to UK GDP every year, supports 944,000 jobs, and drives British science and innovation. There was a 9% decrease in the number of EU postgraduate research students enrolling at Russell Group universities this academic year, following a 9% decline the previous year. Overall enrolments have fallen 3%, reversing years of growth. In Brexit politics, more than half of Conservative party members would rather <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/04/most-tory-members-would-choose-no-deal-over-may-brexit-plan\">leave the EU with no deal</a> than see Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal adopted, according to a survey. And the Brexit ferry company Seaborne Freight not only doesn\u2019t own so much as a plastic swan pedalo \u2013 it also appears to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/03/brexit-freight-ferry-firm-appears-all-geared-up-to-deliver-pizzas\">copy and pasted terms and conditions on its website from a takeaway pizza service</a>.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Us and them \u2013 </strong>Dubbed \u201cFat Cat Friday\u201d, today the average CEO of a FTSE 100 company has already pocketed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/04/uk-ceos-make-more-in-first-three-days-of-2019-than-workers-annual-salary\">equivalent pay for the whole of 2019 of a typical full-time worker in Britain</a>. The High Pay Centre and the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) have found top executives earn 133 times more than the average worker, at a rate of around \u00a31,020 per hour or \u00a33.9m annually. That\u2019s up 11% compared with a year earlier. Meanwhile it has been revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/03/google-tax-haven-bermuda-netherlands\">Google moved \u20ac19.9bn ($22.7bn) through a Dutch shell company to Bermuda</a> in 2017 to reduce its foreign tax bill.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>After all the horror, Assad stays \u2013 </strong>Syria\u2019s ruler has essentially won the country\u2019s brutal war and will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/03/syria-president-assad-will-remain-in-power-for-a-while-says-jeremy-hunt\">remain in power with Russian backing</a>, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary has conceded. But in remarks directed at Moscow, Jeremy Hunt said: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be involved in Syria then you need to make sure that there really is peace in Syria. And that means making sure that President Assad does not use chemical weapons.\u201d Many Arab states have also accepted that Assad has survived the seven-year civil war and are preparing to reopen embassies in Damascus. The British government has previously been at the forefront of calling for Assad to make way for a new government. Donald Trump recently shocked allies and triggered the resignation of his defence secretary by declaring he would pull all US troops out of Syria.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Close to the bone \u2013 </strong>The Green party MP Caroline Lucas will today <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/04/caroline-lucas-green-mp-meat-tax-oxford-farmers-conference-prioritise-sustainability\">call for a tax on meat</a> to help make the farming industry carbon-neutral. \u201cIf the world\u2019s diet doesn\u2019t change, we simply can\u2019t avoid the worst effects of climate change,\u201d Lucas will tell the Oxford Farming Conference. Globally, livestock rearing is estimated to be responsible for about 15% of greenhouse gas emissions, and the \u201cVeganuary\u201d movement is this month encouraging people to abstain from or abandon meat-eating. But Phil Stocker, chief executive of the NSA, defended British sheep farming as one of the least intensive forms of livestock farming compared with beef, pork and poultry megafarms and feedlots in other parts of the world: \u201cOur unique, grass-based method of sheep production in Britain is hidden within more global and general statistics.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Lunchtime read: Our protein obsession needs a shake-up</h2> \n<p>Around half of all UK consumers are apparently seeking to add \u201cextra protein\u201d to their diets, writes Bee Wilson: \u201cIn just a few decades, whey protein has gone from waste product to aspirational lifestyle enhancer \u2026 Anxiety about protein is one of the things that drives a person to drink a flask of vitamin-padded beige slurry and call it lunch.\u201d The fixation has been taken to dangerous levels, potentially contributing to eating disorders, and harm to the liver, kidneys and skeleton.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42af1eecbc00da807ae950a0ea5aa59f8bb086cb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42af1eecbc00da807ae950a0ea5aa59f8bb086cb/0_377_5660_3397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eggs in a cardboard tray\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The urgent question is how we can get our protein ratios back to a healthy level.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Fung/Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In 2005, two biologists named David Raubenheimer and Stephen Simpson produced the \u201cprotein leverage hypothesis\u201d, that this essential nutrient could be the missing link in the obesity crisis.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Children become addicted to likes\u2019 Hello, here we are on a Friday morning. I\u2019m Warren Murray and these are the stories on the agenda today. Social media is fuelling sharply higher rates of depression among girls than boys, a study that interviewed almost 11,000 14-year-olds has found. As many as three-quarters of 14-year-old girls who suffer from depression also have low self-esteem and are unhappy with how they look. Greater daily hours of social media use corresponds to an increase in depressive symptoms, explained Professor Yvonne Kelly from University College London, as well as poor sleep. Anne Longfield, the children\u2019s commissioner for England, warned that even some children as young as nine \u201care becoming almost addicted to \u2018likes\u2019 as a form of social validation that makes them happy\u201d. Shannon McLaughlin, 18, from Blackburn, who was diagnosed with anxiety and depression in her early teens, said: \u201cPeople mostly share the positive things about life on social media, without showing the negatives \u2026 Seeing that everyone was happy and enjoying life made me feel so much worse.\u201d Barbara Keeley, the shadow minister for mental health, said social media firms should be forced to adopt a duty of care to protect young users. Separately this morning, paediatricians are saying that screen time is not inherently bad for children, but parents do need to focus on making sure their children get enough sleep, exercise and family interaction. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has produced guidance including a checklist for whether your family\u2019s screen time is under control. * * * Pelosi back in the chair \u2013 Democrats have reclaimed power in the US House of Representatives from the Republicans and elected Nancy Pelosi back to the speaker\u2019s position that she was the first woman in history to hold. Pelosi swore into office the 116th Congress, which includes a record 102 women. \u201cOur nation is at a historic moment,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo months ago, the American people spoke and demanded a new dawn.\u201d In their first act since taking back control, Democrats last night tested their power by passing legislation to end the near fortnight-long government shutdown. Donald Trump has pledged to veto the bill \u2013 which ignores his demands for billions of dollars for a border wall \u2013 but it sets the tone for what is expected to be a tumultuous final two years of the president\u2019s first term. Republicans still have control of the Senate. Pelosi had to counter Democratic calls for generational change to regain the speaker\u2019s chair. Fifteen of her own party voted against her. * * * Police plan for Brexit hard border \u2013 Almost 1,000 police officers from England and Scotland will train for deployment in Northern Ireland in case a no-deal Brexit causes disorder along the Irish border, the Guardian has learned. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said the Republic was also making serious preparations and reiterated there could be no EU renegotiation with Britain. University leaders say a no-deal Brexit poses \u201cone of the biggest threats\u201d ever faced by the sector, which contributes over \u00a32bn to UK GDP every year, supports 944,000 jobs, and drives British science and innovation. There was a 9% decrease in the number of EU postgraduate research students enrolling at Russell Group universities this academic year, following a 9% decline the previous year. Overall enrolments have fallen 3%, reversing years of growth. In Brexit politics, more than half of Conservative party members would rather leave the EU with no deal than see Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal adopted, according to a survey. And the Brexit ferry company Seaborne Freight not only doesn\u2019t own so much as a plastic swan pedalo \u2013 it also appears to have copy and pasted terms and conditions on its website from a takeaway pizza service. * * * Us and them \u2013 Dubbed \u201cFat Cat Friday\u201d, today the average CEO of a FTSE 100 company has already pocketed the equivalent pay for the whole of 2019 of a typical full-time worker in Britain. The High Pay Centre and the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) have found top executives earn 133 times more than the average worker, at a rate of around \u00a31,020 per hour or \u00a33.9m annually. That\u2019s up 11% compared with a year earlier. Meanwhile it has been revealed that Google moved \u20ac19.9bn ($22.7bn) through a Dutch shell company to Bermuda in 2017 to reduce its foreign tax bill. * * * After all the horror, Assad stays \u2013 Syria\u2019s ruler has essentially won the country\u2019s brutal war and will remain in power with Russian backing, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary has conceded. But in remarks directed at Moscow, Jeremy Hunt said: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be involved in Syria then you need to make sure that there really is peace in Syria. And that means making sure that President Assad does not use chemical weapons.\u201d Many Arab states have also accepted that Assad has survived the seven-year civil war and are preparing to reopen embassies in Damascus. The British government has previously been at the forefront of calling for Assad to make way for a new government. Donald Trump recently shocked allies and triggered the resignation of his defence secretary by declaring he would pull all US troops out of Syria. * * * Close to the bone \u2013 The Green party MP Caroline Lucas will today call for a tax on meat to help make the farming industry carbon-neutral. \u201cIf the world\u2019s diet doesn\u2019t change, we simply can\u2019t avoid the worst effects of climate change,\u201d Lucas will tell the Oxford Farming Conference. Globally, livestock rearing is estimated to be responsible for about 15% of greenhouse gas emissions, and the \u201cVeganuary\u201d movement is this month encouraging people to abstain from or abandon meat-eating. But Phil Stocker, chief executive of the NSA, defended British sheep farming as one of the least intensive forms of livestock farming compared with beef, pork and poultry megafarms and feedlots in other parts of the world: \u201cOur unique, grass-based method of sheep production in Britain is hidden within more global and general statistics.\u201d Lunchtime read: Our protein obsession needs a shake-up Around half of all UK consumers are apparently seeking to add \u201cextra protein\u201d to their diets, writes Bee Wilson: \u201cIn just a few decades, whey protein has gone from waste product to aspirational lifestyle enhancer \u2026 Anxiety about protein is one of the things that drives a person to drink a flask of vitamin-padded beige slurry and call it lunch.\u201d The fixation has been taken to dangerous levels, potentially contributing to eating disorders, and harm to the liver, kidneys and skeleton. In 2005, two biologists named David Raubenheimer and Stephen Simpson produced the \u201cprotein leverage hypothesis\u201d, that this essential nutrient could be the missing link in the obesity crisis. Since the 1960s, the absolute level of protein consumed by the average westerner has not changed. What has changed is the ratio of protein in our diets \u2013 and if many of us overeat, it could be partly because our bodies are desperately seeking out the right ratio of protein \u2013 a nutrient essential for life \u2013 in a food environment flooded with refined wheat, oils and sugars. \u201cThe urgent question,\u201d writes Wilson, \u201cis how we can get our protein ratios back to a healthy level.\u201d Sport Manchester City have reignited the Premier League title race, handing Liverpool their first loss of the season in a pulsating 2-1 win at the Etihad Stadium. A two-footed lunge from City captain Vincent Kompany left Liverpool coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp apoplectic post-match, but it was the poise and calm of Sergio Ag\u00fcero that helped City dent their nearest rivals, writes Barney Ronay. Cheteshwar Pujara continues to frustrate Australia in the fourth Test in Sydney, as India close in on a first-ever series win on the continent. And the Rugby Football Union hopes a shift to full-time professional contracts will help England Women compete with the world\u2019s best, after announcing a historic 35-player squad. Business Japanese markets fell as they opened today for the first time in 2019, following Apple\u2019s earnings warning and a technology-led sell-off on Wall Street. Shanghai, the Hang Seng and South Korea\u2019s Kospi have made gains. In Asia, some traders cheered a private survey showing that China\u2019s services sector expanded in December.

      "bodyText": "Laws which allow the automatic stripping of an Australian\u2019s citizenship contain a high risk that someone may be left stateless, the president of the Law Council has said, amid a growing standoff between Australia and Fiji over the Isis recruiter Neil Prakash. Arthur Moses SC said Prakash\u2019s case demonstrated the concerns the council had raised in 2015 when the Australian government introduced the legislation, and raised \u201cserious questions\u201d regarding its process. Last week it was revealed the Australian government had revoked Prakash\u2019s Australian citizenship because of his terrorism affiliations and actions, on the understanding he was a dual national of Fiji. However, Fijian immigration authorities said they have no record of Prakash visiting Fiji, being a citizen, applying for citizenship or having someone apply on his behalf. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, maintains the government\u2019s legal advice \u2013 that Prakash is Fijian \u2013 is correct. \u201cIf Prakash is in fact not a Fijian citizen, this raises serious questions regarding the automatic loss of citizenship under Australian law which requires a person to be a national or citizen of a country other than Australia,\u201d Moses said on Friday. \u201cThis is an issue that needs to be properly investigated and respectfully discussed with Fiji.\u201d Moses said loss of citizenship should only occur after a criminal conviction, and it should not be automatic. \u201c[It] should require a ministerial decision that considers whether the offender poses a substantial risk to Australia\u2019s national security, as well as our international legal obligations,\u201d he said. \u201cThe minister\u2019s decision should afford procedural fairness and be subject to judicial review.\u201d The Law Council has also previously warned about proposed legislation a minister could strip a convicted terrorist of Australian citizenship regardless of the severity of the conviction and need only be \u201creasonably satisfied\u201d that the person had another citizenship. The Labor party has called for Dutton to release the legal advice which he claims said Prakash held Fijian citizenship. \u201cDual citizens who choose to be involved in terrorism forfeit the privileges of Australian citizenship, and I remain committed to enforcing the legal provisions that remove them,\u201d Dutton said on Saturday. However, after it emerged Fiji had no record of Prakash, Dutton sought to distance himself from the decision, releasing a statement which said the loss of citizenship occurred \u201cautomatically\u201d after assessment by the Citizenship Loss Board. The Citizenship Loss Board \u201ccomprising senior officials from several government departments, law enforcement and security agencies, examined the requirements for cessation of Australian citizenship in relation to Mr Prakash, namely: that he had been in the service of a declared terrorist organisation, Islamic State; that he satisfied age requirements as someone who is older than 14 years; and that he was a citizen of another country,\u201d Dutton said. \u201cNeither the Citizenship Loss Board nor I make decisions on whether an individual ceases to be an Australian citizen, as the provisions operate automatically by virtue of a person\u2019s conduct.\u201d Dutton also said the government had been in close contact with Fiji about Prakash, despite the head of Fiji\u2019s immigration department telling Guardian Australia he learned of the situation through the media and was still yet to hear from the Australian government. Moses said the government needed to ensure there was a \u201cproper basis\u201d for the loss of citizenship linked to national security, \u201cwhich does not lead to uncertainty or disputes with our allies\u201d. \u201cWhen an announcement of international and national importance is made, the government must ensure it is not premature and is verified.\u201d",

In other words: are e-cigarettes creating a new generation of nicotine users, and will these vapers become the smokers of the future?</p> <p>Scientists and regulators on both sides of the Atlantic pondered the evidence on these questions in 2018 and came to different conclusions. In the US, the <a href=\"http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/2018/public-health-consequences-of-e-cigarettes.aspx\">National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine</a> reported that \u201cthere is substantial evidence that e-cigarette use increases risk of ever using combustible tobacco cigarettes among youth and young adults\u201d. Advice from the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/index.htm\">Centres for Disease Control and Prevention</a> says: \u201cE-cigarettes are not safe for youth, young adults, pregnant women or adults who do not currently use tobacco products.\u201d</p> <p>In the UK, an updated evidence review from <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/e-cigarettes-and-heated-tobacco-products-evidence-review/evidence-review-of-e-cigarettes-and-heated-tobacco-products-2018-executive-summary#use-of-e-cigarettes-among-young-people\">Public Health England</a> concluded: \u201cE-cigarettes are attracting very few young people who have never smoked into regular use, and e-cigarettes do not appear to be undermining the long-term decline in cigarette smoking in the UK among young people.\u201d In addition, a <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmsctech/505/50506.htm#_idTextAnchor021\">House of Commons science and technology committee</a> report stated: \u201cConcerns about the risk of e-cigarettes potentially providing a \u2018gateway\u2019 into conventional smoking have not materialised to any significant degree.\u201d</p> <h2>What explains these differences?</h2> <p>Trends in vaping may be diverging between the UK and US \u2013 two countries that have traditionally taken a fairly permissive approach to e-cigarettes. Surveys in both countries include questions on experimentation with vaping, such as whether a person has ever tried an e-cigarette. This type of experimentation is more common in the US than the UK. Among teenagers in their final year of secondary school in the US, around age 18, <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/teens-using-vaping-devices-record-numbers\">37% reported having tried an e-cigarette in the past year</a>. Among 18-year-olds in Great Britain, the <a href=\"http://ash.org.uk/media-and-news/press-releases-media-and-news/new-ash-data-reveals-that-youth-use-of-e-cigarettes-in-great-britain-is-very-low/\">most recent survey data</a> found 23% had tried vaping. In addition, two large national youth surveys in the US, <a href=\"http://monitoringthefuture.org/\">Monitoring the Future</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/PublicHealthEducation/ProtectingKidsfromTobacco/ucm625887.htm\">National Youth Tobacco Survey</a>, found significant increases in the use of e-cigarettes between 2017 and 2018, a sharp rise not seen in the UK.</p> <p>Differences in how use is measured may play a role. In the US, survey questions focus on whether someone has ever used an e-cigarette or whether they have used one recently (in the past 30 days). Use in the past 30 days is a broad measure that means teenagers who may simply have tried an e-cigarette once or twice in the past month are included in those figures. In the UK, in contrast, there has been a focus on measuring regular use (at least weekly) and on whether young people who have never smoked cigarettes are vaping. UK figures over several recent years have found that <a href=\"http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/14/9/973/pdf\">regular use of e-cigarettes</a> by teenagers who have never smoked remains very low, at less than 1%.</p> <p>Differing policies may also help explain these differences. In the UK, almost all forms of e-cigarette marketing have been banned since 2016. This is not the case in the US. In addition, newer devices appear to be popular with young Americans. These include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/apr/09/juul-ecigarette-popular-children-vape-pen-nicotine\">Juul</a>, which are small, discreet, easy to use and deliver nicotine more rapidly than older models, and have only recently become available in the UK. The EU also imposes limits on the amount of nicotine in e-cigarettes, controls not in place in the US.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"712a05cc7c3c523de1fab05eb4b9887712d42c4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/712a05cc7c3c523de1fab05eb4b9887712d42c4f/0_346_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juul e-cigarettes for sale in a store\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Newer devices such as Juul have proven popular with young Americans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seth Wenig/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Attitudes to nicotine also differ. The UK has <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph45\">official guidance on tobacco harm reduction</a> that recognises nicotine is not the harmful substance in tobacco (it is the thousands of other chemicals in cigarettes) and nicotine replacement therapy is licensed for use in smokers who are pregnant or children above the age of 12. In the US, the statement that nicotine harms the developing brain (evidence that comes from studies with mice and rats, not humans) is <a href=\"https://e-cigarettes.surgeongeneral.gov/\">widely used in official documents</a>. This means any e-cigarette use by American youth, even experimentation, is viewed as a cause for concern.</p> <p>This transatlantic debate has wider implications because reports of study findings are played out in the global media, causing confusion in countries that have not yet decided how to regulate e-cigarettes. The reported rise in youth vaping in the US has resulted in a <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-health-ecigarettes/fda-chief-to-meet-e-cigarette-makers-amid-crackdown-idUKKCN1OQ1D1\">crackdown</a> on the American e-cigarette market, with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requiring Juul and other similar products to be removed from many retail outlets. The FDA has invested <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/KnowTheRealCost\">in graphic public information campaigns</a> to discourage youth vaping. These campaigns emphasise the risks without mentioning the research that shows e-cigarettes can help smokers quit. One consequence is that only <a href=\"https://hints.cancer.gov/view-questions-topics/question-details.aspx?qid=1282\">2.6% of Americans</a> now believe vaping is much less harmful than smoking, despite plenty of <a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-us/cancer-news/press-release/2017-02-06-e-cigarettes-safer-than-smoking-says-long-term-study\">research showing</a> that to be the case.</p> <p>This misperception of the risk is seen in the UK as well, albeit not to the same degree. Research <a href=\"https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.14502\">published on Friday in the journal Addiction</a> found that even among smokers and ex-smokers in the UK, just over half surveyed (57.3%) correctly believed e-cigarettes were less harmful than smoking, while 25% believed them to be equally or more harmful. Many of those surveyed (nearly four in 10) incorrectly believed that nicotine was the cancer-causing compound in cigarettes, and almost nine in 10 overestimated the health risk from nicotine.</p> <p>Evidence from the US and UK combined indicates that efforts to deter teenagers from trying vaping may discourage adult smokers from using e-cigarettes to quit smoking. Fortunately, in both countries smoking rates continue to decline for both adults and young people, a fact often forgotten amid the furore about e-cigarettes. If e-cigarettes were a gateway to tobacco, these trends would stall or be reversed. And in the UK at least, <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/for-your-body/quit-smoking/using-e-cigarettes-vapes-to-quit-smoking/\">government agencies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/smoking-and-cancer/are-e-cigarettes-harmful#ecigsrefs0\">leading charities</a> actively support vaping as a positive choice for smokers trying to stop.</p> <p>We should not be forced to choose between protecting children and supporting the one in two adult smokers who will suffer and die prematurely from a smoking-related disease if they continue to smoke.

It did, briefly, in the 80s in the US, and then it stopped. It\u2019s not a big deal for most of us, but for host Brian Thompson, it really matters. Or he\u2019s good at pretending it matters, anyway. What started as a parody of investigative journalism podcasts such as Serial has become something much stranger and improbably reached its 100th episode in December. Improbable because Thompson discovered the answer in one of the first episodes of the series: they took too long to make, which is no good for a fast-food business.</p> <p>Thompson, or rather the persona he adopts and never drops in this podcast, refused to believe it, and has drawn the FBI, Donald Trump, the film Willow, his local library and various podcasting celebrities into an imaginary web of intrigue. Episodes are rarely more than 10 minutes and usually revolve around excruciating phone conversations between Thompson and the latest figure he has identified in the coverup. </p> <p>It all sounds very silly, and WHTPAM is essentially a comedy podcast, but Thompson\u2019s manner is a genuinely sharp mockery of true-crime audio investigators, and a triumph of his surreal flights of fancy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Talking points In what seems to be becoming a daily occurrence, another podcast is being adapted for the small screen, with a new version of popular supernatural fiction pod The Black Tapes in development at NBC, according to Deadline. Meanwhile, NPR are going to monitor podcast-listening habits in an attempt to find out which ads we stick with and which we skip. Finally, in case you missed it in the pre-Christmas rush, the creators of the Guardian\u2019s podcasts picked the 15 pods they enjoyed last year. Picks of the week Podcast from the Past Just like host Tom Jackson\u2019s cult Twitter hit Postcard from the Past, his podcast \u2013 where people have a chat about the cardboard oblongs \u2013 also has a charming retro feel. Special guests include the likes of Nick Heyward, Bonnie Greer and Robin Ince, and it features good stories about mini golf, haunted pictures and jesters. Start with Gary Kemp, who lovingly recalls how he would always send a postcard to his friend when he was on tour with Spandau Ballet and digs one out from Live Aid. Hannah Verdier Murderville Murderville has the key ingredients of a true-crime podcast: a brutal killing, a wronged man and two investigative journalists \u2013 Liliana Segura and Jordan Smith \u2013 who have found \u201cquite a few problems with the investigation\u201d. It follows the story of Devonia Inman, who was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Donna Brown, the night manager of a Taco Bell in Adel, Georgia. If he didn\u2019t commit the crime, the real killer is out there \u2013 and since Inman was imprisoned, there have been more murders in the small town. HV Guardian pick: Chips With Everything Next year is the 20th anniversary of what some joked was one of the biggest anticlimaxes to ever hit the globe: Y2K. But now cybersecurity experts are warning us that forgetting the potential impact of an event similar to the millennium bug could have disastrous effects. Just look at Japan. Experts are predicting we might see a Y2K-type problem on the island when Emperor Akihito abdicates the throne this year. In this week\u2019s Chips With Everything, Jordan Erica Webber chats to one of the people who was in charge of trying to safeguard against the full wrath of Y2K. They look at what might have been, what actually was, and what might yet still be for the millennium bug and others like it. Producer pick: Whatever Happened to Pizza at McDonald\u2019s? 100th episode Recommended by Charlie Phillips (head of documentaries, the Guardian) Did you know McDonald\u2019s used to serve pizza? It did, briefly, in the 80s in the US, and then it stopped. It\u2019s not a big deal for most of us, but for host Brian Thompson, it really matters. Or he\u2019s good at pretending it matters, anyway. What started as a parody of investigative journalism podcasts such as Serial has become something much stranger and improbably reached its 100th episode in December. Improbable because Thompson discovered the answer in one of the first episodes of the series: they took too long to make, which is no good for a fast-food business. Thompson, or rather the persona he adopts and never drops in this podcast, refused to believe it, and has drawn the FBI, Donald Trump, the film Willow, his local library and various podcasting celebrities into an imaginary web of intrigue. Episodes are rarely more than 10 minutes and usually revolve around excruciating phone conversations between Thompson and the latest figure he has identified in the coverup. It all sounds very silly, and WHTPAM is essentially a comedy podcast, but Thompson\u2019s manner is a genuinely sharp mockery of true-crime audio investigators, and a triumph of his surreal flights of fancy.",

      "body": "<p>In 1953, Hollywood comedians Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy embarked on a farewell tour of the British music hall circuit, dragging their luggage from one provincial hotel to the next. They pulled pints for the cameras, judged a beauty pageant at Butlins and reprised slapstick routines from their 1930s two-reelers. The tour was a hit but it was tinged with sadness as well. There are few sights so poignant as the exhausted antics of an ageing clown.</p> <p>The trick, says Steve Coogan, is to keep moving, branch out. Aged 53, he feels that comedy, by and large, is a young man\u2019s game. He has been there, he has done it, and is shifting towards drama. \u201cIt\u2019s fine to be biting, acerbic and silly when you\u2019re young,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when you grow up you need to act like a grownup.\u201d Then he catches himself and winces at his presumption. \u201cMaybe that just means I\u2019ve got flabby and middle aged.\u201d</p> <p>The jury is still out but I think maturity suits him. Coogan\u2019s reputation was forged during his hectic 90s heyday, when he carried himself like a Premier League footballer, the cocksure comic striker behind witless Alan Partridge. These days, the hair has gone grey while the roles have turned more knotty, nuanced and tender. He was deftly affecting in the Bafta-winning Philomena, thin-skinned and whip-smart in Michael Winterbottom\u2019s The Trip, and he gives a lovely, limber performance in Stan &amp; Ollie, a bittersweet account of the duo\u2019s swansong British tour.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s hard to make a comedy from success. The best ones are about failure and bad luck and inadequacy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Coogan explains that he started his career doing the voices on Spitting Image, so impersonating Laurel came relatively easily (the diffident smile; the precise, flat vowels). The hard part was digging behind the facade, revealing the man behind the screen image. But he is wary of sounding too precious about this; God forbid he should come over all Daniel Day-Lewis. \u201cI\u2019ve never really been a method actor,\u201d he scoffs. \u201cI don\u2019t think Mike Leigh would like me. If he wanted me to do a medieval melodrama, I\u2019d still be wearing my underpants from Marks &amp; Spencer underneath my costume; I don\u2019t care what he says.\u201d</p> <p>There is a cafetiere inside the hotel room. Coogan insists on playing mother. He pours the coffee with a flourish but then struggles with the milk, which comes in a little carton that must be pierced with a plastic straw. His angle is wrong; the milk squirts out in a jet. For a brief, fleeting moment, he could be Partridge <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yrop_GZsp-U\" title=\"\">back at the Linton Travel Tavern</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdcBNrjc3wo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MdcBNrjc3wo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>On screen, Laurel played gormless underling to Hardy\u2019s finicky little king. Off screen, though, the roles were reversed. Laurel co-directed the pictures and devised the bulk of the gags. He was at once ringmaster and clown, the artist and the clay, to the point where it became difficult to spot where the man ended and the character began.</p> <p>Coogan suspects that this is a common confusion. \u201cLook at Tony Hancock. Look at John Cleese with Basil Fawlty. What a comedian does is take their own essence and then channel it. Stan certainly did that. And I do it too, principally with Alan Partridge. He\u2019s my way of channelling all my worst tendencies, my general ineptitude.\u201d He pauses: \u201cIn fact, come to think of it, it\u2019s not just comedians. Most movie stars are 80% versions of who they are off camera.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/11/tea-and-buns-with-laurel-and-hardy-the-day-i-met-my-comedy-heroes\">Tea and buns with Laurel and Hardy: Derek Malcolm on the day he met his comedy heroes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On screen (and arguably off it, too) Laurel and Hardy were at once inseparable and at permanent loggerheads. They gave the impression of being as much tragic as funny, the inspiration for Vladimir and Estragon in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/mar/08/samuel-beckett-waiting-for-godot\" title=\"\">Waiting for Godot</a>. And at times Stan &amp; Ollie \u2013 directed by John S Baird with a script by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/jeff-pope\" title=\"\">Jeff Pope</a>, Coogan\u2019s co-writer on Philomena \u2013 feels more indebted to Samuel Beckett than to the comedy of Laurel and Hardy producer Hal Roach. It\u2019s a dying fall of a film: a tale of dwindling resources and aching limbs and two men who suspect they are being edged inexorably towards the exit door. Coogan thinks that this is entirely as it should be.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to make a comedy from success,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe best ones are about failure and bad luck and inadequacy. And this film is about the transience of all the success that went before.\u201d Another pause. \u201cDo you know that film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umAxeO-QfmY\" title=\"\">Anvil: The Story of Anvil</a>? It\u2019s a documentary about a heavy metal band and their glory days are behind them and they\u2019re flat broke. And I don\u2019t particularly like the music. In fact, I sort of hate it. But what I was really moved by was their affection and unfailing loyalty in middle age. It\u2019s only as they get older that they realise they love each other.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>If someone said I was boring, that would bother me. But if I\u2019m no longer funny, well, then I\u2019ll do something not funny</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I wonder if the same might be said of The Trip. If not a tale of failure, exactly, Michael Winterbottom\u2019s sitcom, initially on BBC Two, now on Sky Atlantic, brilliantly exposes the limits of success, the fragility of the male ego and the bond between two sparring partners whose relationship is closer than they would care to admit. Coogan and Rob Brydon play versions of themselves: affluent, status-conscious performers, each vying for the upper hand. Coogan likes to dismiss Brydon as a middle-of-the-road entertainer, a reliable footsoldier on the panel-show circuit. Brydon, in turn, suggests that his rival is a 1990s timepiece, a hedonistic antique like \u201cOasis or cocaine\u201d. The Trip is partly scripted, partly improvised. It\u2019s a comedy fiction, but there\u2019s a truth to it, too.</p> <p>Coogan pushes his spectacles back up the bridge of his nose. \u201cI remember Rob once saying to me: \u2018The trouble with you is that you\u2019re not funny any more.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c25250e53231f07d5542eb6ef0c57131f26bf9b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c25250e53231f07d5542eb6ef0c57131f26bf9b7/0_428_6541_3924/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon in The Trip\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italian job \u2026 Coogan and Rob Brydon in The Trip.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wait a minute \u2026 was this on camera or off? \u201cGod knows.

      "bodyText": "In 1953, Hollywood comedians Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy embarked on a farewell tour of the British music hall circuit, dragging their luggage from one provincial hotel to the next. They pulled pints for the cameras, judged a beauty pageant at Butlins and reprised slapstick routines from their 1930s two-reelers. The tour was a hit but it was tinged with sadness as well. There are few sights so poignant as the exhausted antics of an ageing clown. The trick, says Steve Coogan, is to keep moving, branch out. Aged 53, he feels that comedy, by and large, is a young man\u2019s game. He has been there, he has done it, and is shifting towards drama. \u201cIt\u2019s fine to be biting, acerbic and silly when you\u2019re young,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when you grow up you need to act like a grownup.\u201d Then he catches himself and winces at his presumption. \u201cMaybe that just means I\u2019ve got flabby and middle aged.\u201d The jury is still out but I think maturity suits him. Coogan\u2019s reputation was forged during his hectic 90s heyday, when he carried himself like a Premier League footballer, the cocksure comic striker behind witless Alan Partridge. These days, the hair has gone grey while the roles have turned more knotty, nuanced and tender. He was deftly affecting in the Bafta-winning Philomena, thin-skinned and whip-smart in Michael Winterbottom\u2019s The Trip, and he gives a lovely, limber performance in Stan &amp; Ollie, a bittersweet account of the duo\u2019s swansong British tour. Coogan explains that he started his career doing the voices on Spitting Image, so impersonating Laurel came relatively easily (the diffident smile; the precise, flat vowels). The hard part was digging behind the facade, revealing the man behind the screen image. But he is wary of sounding too precious about this; God forbid he should come over all Daniel Day-Lewis. \u201cI\u2019ve never really been a method actor,\u201d he scoffs. \u201cI don\u2019t think Mike Leigh would like me. If he wanted me to do a medieval melodrama, I\u2019d still be wearing my underpants from Marks &amp; Spencer underneath my costume; I don\u2019t care what he says.\u201d There is a cafetiere inside the hotel room. Coogan insists on playing mother. He pours the coffee with a flourish but then struggles with the milk, which comes in a little carton that must be pierced with a plastic straw. His angle is wrong; the milk squirts out in a jet. For a brief, fleeting moment, he could be Partridge back at the Linton Travel Tavern. On screen, Laurel played gormless underling to Hardy\u2019s finicky little king. Off screen, though, the roles were reversed. Laurel co-directed the pictures and devised the bulk of the gags. He was at once ringmaster and clown, the artist and the clay, to the point where it became difficult to spot where the man ended and the character began. Coogan suspects that this is a common confusion. \u201cLook at Tony Hancock. Look at John Cleese with Basil Fawlty. What a comedian does is take their own essence and then channel it. Stan certainly did that. And I do it too, principally with Alan Partridge. He\u2019s my way of channelling all my worst tendencies, my general ineptitude.\u201d He pauses: \u201cIn fact, come to think of it, it\u2019s not just comedians. Most movie stars are 80% versions of who they are off camera.\u201d On screen (and arguably off it, too) Laurel and Hardy were at once inseparable and at permanent loggerheads. They gave the impression of being as much tragic as funny, the inspiration for Vladimir and Estragon in Waiting for Godot. And at times Stan &amp; Ollie \u2013 directed by John S Baird with a script by Jeff Pope, Coogan\u2019s co-writer on Philomena \u2013 feels more indebted to Samuel Beckett than to the comedy of Laurel and Hardy producer Hal Roach. It\u2019s a dying fall of a film: a tale of dwindling resources and aching limbs and two men who suspect they are being edged inexorably towards the exit door. Coogan thinks that this is entirely as it should be. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make a comedy from success,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe best ones are about failure and bad luck and inadequacy. And this film is about the transience of all the success that went before.\u201d Another pause. \u201cDo you know that film Anvil: The Story of Anvil? It\u2019s a documentary about a heavy metal band and their glory days are behind them and they\u2019re flat broke. And I don\u2019t particularly like the music. In fact, I sort of hate it. But what I was really moved by was their affection and unfailing loyalty in middle age. It\u2019s only as they get older that they realise they love each other.\u201d I wonder if the same might be said of The Trip. If not a tale of failure, exactly, Michael Winterbottom\u2019s sitcom, initially on BBC Two, now on Sky Atlantic, brilliantly exposes the limits of success, the fragility of the male ego and the bond between two sparring partners whose relationship is closer than they would care to admit. Coogan and Rob Brydon play versions of themselves: affluent, status-conscious performers, each vying for the upper hand. Coogan likes to dismiss Brydon as a middle-of-the-road entertainer, a reliable footsoldier on the panel-show circuit. Brydon, in turn, suggests that his rival is a 1990s timepiece, a hedonistic antique like \u201cOasis or cocaine\u201d. The Trip is partly scripted, partly improvised. It\u2019s a comedy fiction, but there\u2019s a truth to it, too. Coogan pushes his spectacles back up the bridge of his nose. \u201cI remember Rob once saying to me: \u2018The trouble with you is that you\u2019re not funny any more.\u2019\u201d Wait a minute \u2026 was this on camera or off? \u201cGod knows. It was in that sort of grey area in between. He was thinking: \u2018What will really annoy Steve?\u2019 And I remember thinking: \u2018That\u2019s not the worst thing you can say to me.\u2019 I don\u2019t think: \u2018Oh my God, if I\u2019m not funny my whole existence will crumble.\u2019 It\u2019s not my oxygen, being funny all the time. That\u2019s a dysfunction. It\u2019s just weird, to be honest. It would bother him more; that\u2019s probably why he said it.\u201d He grimaces. \u201cI mean, if someone said I was boring, that would bother me. But if I\u2019m no longer funny, well, then I\u2019ll do something not funny. There are a lot of other things to be.\u201d For Stan Laurel, born in Lancashire and raised on music hall, the 1953 British tour was a homecoming of sorts. In his own way, Coogan is similarly circling back to his roots. He was born in Middleton, north of Manchester, to a large Irish Catholic family.

      "body": "<p>Are you getting enough protein? The question provides its own answer: if you are worrying about the amount of protein in your diet, then you are almost certainly eating more than enough. This is the paradox of our new protein obsession. For many people, protein has become a kind of secular unction: it instantly anoints any food with an aura of health and goodness. On the menu at the gym where I go, a salad ni\u00e7oise is now repackaged as \u201chigh-protein tuna\u201d. It comes without the usual capers or olives \u2013 those are items that merely add flavour, and who needs that?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/jan/21/protein-mania-the-rich-worlds-new-diet-obsession-podcast\">Protein mania: the rich world\u2019s new diet obsession \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Pinterest, the lifestyle-sharing site, you can now choose \u201cprotein\u201d as one of your interests in life, along with \u201ccute animals\u201d and \u201cinspirational quotes\u201d. In 2017, there were 64m Google searches for \u201cprotein\u201d. Anxiety about protein is one of the things that drives a person to drink a flask of vitamin-padded beige slurry and call it lunch.</p> <p>You merely need to visit a western supermarket today to see that many people regard protein as some kind of universal elixir \u2013 one food companies are profitably adding to anything they can. \u201cWhen the Box Says \u2018Protein\u2019, Shoppers Say \u2018I\u2019ll take it\u2019\u201d was the headline of a 2013 article in the Wall Street Journal. In addition to the ubiquitous protein balls, protein bars and protein shakes, you can now buy protein noodles, protein bagels, protein cookies and \u2013 wait for it \u2013 protein coffee. Even foods that are naturally high in protein such as cheese and yoghurt are sold in protein-boosted versions. Strangest of all might be \u201cprotein water\u201d \u2013 clear, fruit-flavoured drinks laced with whey protein, as if ordinary water was insufficiently healthy.</p> <p>Around half of all UK consumers are apparently seeking to add \u201cextra protein\u201d to their diets, according to market research from the cereal brand Weetabix \u2013 which has also cashed in on our hunger for protein. The protein version of Weetabix \u2013 a 24-pack of which costs 50p more than the same-sized pack of original Weetabix \u2013 is worth \u00a37m in sales per year.</p> <p>In a way, there\u2019s nothing strange in the fact that we see protein as valuable, because it is. Along with fat and carbohydrate, it is one of the three basic macronutrients, and arguably the most important. We could survive without carbohydrates, but fat and protein are essential. Protein is the only macronutrient to contain nitrogen, without which we cannot grow or reproduce. There are nine amino-acid proteins \u2013 the building blocks of human tissue \u2013 that we can only get from food. Without them, we could grow neither healthy hair and nails nor strong bones and muscle, and our immune system would be impaired. A child who lacks vital protein in the first five years of life will suffer from stunting and sometimes wasting, too, as the dreadful persistence of malnutrition in the developing world reminds us.</p> <p>So the puzzle is not that we should crave protein, but that our protein anxiety has become so acute at a time when the average person in developed countries has a surfeit of protein in their diet \u2013 at least according to official guidelines, which recommend a minimum of 0.8g of protein a day per kilogram of body weight. According to 2015 data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the average person in the US and Canada gets a full 90g a day, a fifth more than the recommended amount (based on a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3408371/\">normal North American adult weight of about 80kg</a>). The average European is not far behind with 85g of protein a day, and the average Chinese person consumes 75g.</p> <p>When we seek out extra protein to sprinkle over our diets, most of us in rich countries are fixating on \u201ca problem that doesn\u2019t exist\u201d, said David L Katz, an American doctor and public health scholar who is the director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center. In his latest book, The Truth About Food, Katz notes that while the \u201cmythology of protein tends to propagate the notion that more is better\u201d, there are serious concerns that a very high protein intake over a lifetime can result in harm to the liver, kidneys and skeleton.</p> <p>The current protein mania has partly come about because so many people now regard carbohydrates or fats (and sometimes both) with suspicion. In the current nutrition wars, protein has emerged as the last macronutrient left standing. But the whole \u201cmacronutrient fixation\u201d is a \u201cboondoggle\u201d that has been calamitous for public health, Katz told me. \u201cFirst they told us to cut fat. But instead of wholegrains and lentils, we ate low-fat junk food.\u201d Then food marketers heard the message about cutting carbs and sold us protein-enriched junk foods instead. \u201cWhen we talk about protein,\u201d said Katz, \u201cwe are dissociating the nutrient from its food source.\u201d</p> <p>And yet still we try to get more protein. In this world of abundance, humans seem to be on an eternal quest for the one safe substance that we can consume in limitless quantities without gaining weight. Such is the appeal of Diet Coke.</p> <p>Our protein anxiety drives us to take diets already high in meats, soya, sugars and ultra-processed foods and dose them with yet more meats, soya, sugary bars and ultra-processed foods because they are marketed to us as \u201cprotein\u201d \u2013 even though many of these products are not even particularly high in protein.</p> <p>There is something paradoxical about our collective protein worship. When we pay good money for protein-enhanced food, we hope it will lead us to better health (however that is defined). Yet our single-minded pursuit of protein \u2013 as a disembodied nutrient whose presence trumps all other considerations \u2013 can lead us to behave as if we have forgotten everything we knew about food.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The intensity of our protein obsession can only be understood as part of a wider series of diet battles that go back half a century. If we now thirst for protein as if it were water, it may be because the other two macronutrients \u2013 fats and carbohydrates \u2013 have each in turn been made to seem toxic in the public mind.</p> <p>Official dietary guidelines in the US and UK still insist that a healthy diet is one founded on plenty of carbohydrates with limited quantities of fat, especially saturated fat. The rationale for this low-fat advice goes back to the landmark Seven Countries Study, conducted in the 1950s by the American physiologist Ancel Keys. Based on his observation of healthy, olive oil-eating Mediterranean populations, Keys argued that affluent westerners would suffer fewer cases of heart disease if they could limit consumption of saturated fats such as those found in butter, lard and meat.</p> <p>But as interpreted in the modern supermarket, the low-fat diet often ended up being a high-sugar and high-refined-carbohydrate diet, which was not quite what nutritionists had originally envisaged. In recent years, the low-fat, high-carb orthodoxy has come under fierce attack. In 2015, a <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h3978\" title=\"\">meta-analysis</a> conducted by a team of Canadian researchers concluded that intake of saturated fat was not associated with raised risk of stroke, type 2 diabetes or death from heart disease. Vocal anti-sugar campaigners such as Gary Taubes \u2013 author of The Case Against Sugar \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/05/is-sugar-worlds-most-popular-drug\" title=\"\">have argued</a> that the true cause of our current epidemic of diet-related ill health is not in fact saturated fat, but refined carbohydrate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/05/is-sugar-worlds-most-popular-drug\">Is sugar the world\u2019s most popular drug? | Gary Taubes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the low-fattists and the low-carbists continue to slug it out, protein comes out the winner as the one safe thing that most of the population feel they can still put their faith in, whether for weight loss or general health. We have to eat <em>something</em>, after all. </p> <p>The current protein fetish is merely the latest manifestation of a far larger phenomenon that Michael Pollan memorably referred to as \u201cnutritionism\u201d around 10 years ago. For decades now, there has been a tendency to think about what we eat and drink in terms of nutrients, rather than real whole ingredients in all their complexity. A combination of diet fads and clever marketing has got us here. It doesn\u2019t matter whether we fixate on \u201clow fat\u201d or \u201clow carbs\u201d or \u201chigh protein\u201d \u2013 we are making the same old mistakes about nutrition in a new form. </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For a while, on my kitchen counter, next to the jars of rice and flour, there was another canister made of black plastic, much larger than the others. Its label said \u201cSOURCE OF HIGH QUALITY PROTEINS\u201d in huge letters. In much smaller lettering it said \u201cREADY TO MIX PROTEIN POWDER WITH SWEETENERS\u201d and listed three kinds of whey protein: whey protein isolate, whey protein concentrate and hydrolysed whey protein. When you opened it, a fake vanilla smell wafted into the air and you saw a whitish powder and a black plastic scoop.</p> <p>This soulless canister of ultra-processed whey protein was something that I, as a food writer, never thought I would see in my kitchen. The macho aesthetic of the packaging made my heart sink. I am also no fan of artificial sweeteners, which I believe do no favours either to the palate or to gut bacteria. What\u2019s more, I believe most people should be able to get the nutrients we need from a balanced diet, rather than through supplements.</p> <p>But nothing forces you to bend your own principles like parenthood. I turned to whey protein in a state of mild desperation for my very tall youngest son, who plays competitive sport five or six days a week. Three square meals plus multiple snacks only scratched the surface of his appetite, and he was sometimes almost crying with hunger by dinnertime. My conversations with other sport parents suggest that it\u2019s not uncommon to be at least a little bit obsessed with their child\u2019s protein intake. We grumble that protein bars are a pointless rip-off \u2013 and then we buy another pack of them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e9e1e740c42e618e4dae76b86b7099b146e16635\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9e1e740c42e618e4dae76b86b7099b146e16635/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vanilla protein powder.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vanilla protein powder.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arisha Singh/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Protein means different things to different people. To some, it symbolises \u201cweight loss\u201d, while to others it means \u201cmuscles\u201d. To me it appeared as a magical filling substance that just might help my son to be less ravenous.</p> <p>I had read studies suggesting protein was the most filling \u2013 or satiating \u2013 of the three macronutrients, and wondered if more protein at breakfast could be the answer. I tried him on homemade waffles enriched with almonds and hidden eggs (at that point he wouldn\u2019t countenance whole eggs) and the improvement in his energy levels was dramatic. It was a short step to making him occasional smoothies from half a scoop of whey protein with milk and bananas or frozen berries. Despite my unease at the powder, I could genuinely see the difference in his levels of fullness. When the canister was empty I didn\u2019t replace it, but I still monitor my son\u2019s protein intake.</p> <p>Having \u201cenough\u201d protein in your diet to meet your basic needs is not necessarily the same as having the right amount for optimum health. When I asked David Katz how much protein a person should consume, he said certain people may indeed require more than the minimum recommendation of 0.8g per kilo of bodyweight \u2013 including athletes like my son. The problem is that once we start thinking more protein is automatically better, it can be hard to know when to stop. The idea that protein is synonymous with healthy eating leads many people to eat in disordered ways that are far from healthy, either for body or mind.</p> <p>A couple of years ago, Sarah Shephard, a thirtysomething British sports journalist, realised she was obsessed with protein. On a typical day, she was eating three or four protein bars, hard-boiled eggs, meat, fish and non-starchy vegetables and a couple of protein shakes. Virtually the only carbs in her diet came from the protein bars and shakes. It reached the point where she had so little energy in the evenings because of the lack of calories in her body that she stopped going out.</p> <p>Shephard\u2019s protein obsession started when injury forced her to give up running. After she started doing boxing and circuits with a new trainer, he told her she should be eating more protein to help prevent future injuries. To start with, Shephard\u2019s new low-carb, high-protein regime felt wonderful. She lost weight, gained muscle and became one of the many people at the gym clutching their sleek flask of protein shake like an amulet.</p> <p>However, she noticed her thoughts about protein were becoming obsessive. Given the choice between an apple and a protein bar, she always chose the protein bar, even though at a rational level she knew that a piece of fresh fruit with its fibre and vitamins had a lot to recommend it over a processed snack. By the time she finally sought help from a sports nutritionist, he said he had never seen anyone with such an intensive fitness regime who ate so little carbohydrate. She was consuming 150g of protein a day, around 2.5g per kilo of bodyweight \u2013 far in excess of the upper limit recommended for bodybuilders by the US Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.</p> <p>Shephard slowly weaned herself back on to a more balanced diet that included a range of complex carbohydrates such as oats and brown rice. Despite her apprehension, she did not gain weight. When I spoke to her, Shephard had been eating a balanced diet for more than two years without any ill effects, and was a bit mystified as to how she had drifted into her protein fixation.</p> <p>Encouraged by the marketers of high-protein foods, many people talk about whether we we have reached our daily target for \u201cmacros\u201d, but we do not talk so much about how much is too much. Adding extra protein beyond our needs can be harmful for people with underlying kidney or liver problems, as the body can struggle<strong> </strong>to process the excess.</p> <p>In 2017 there were sensationalist headlines around the world when Meegan Hefford, a 25-year-old Australian bodybuilder, died after consuming high amounts of protein shakes and supplements. Hefford hadn\u2019t realised she was suffering from a condition called urea cycle disorder, which meant that her body couldn\u2019t metabolise protein normally. Defenders of high-protein diets immediately attacked the coverage of the story, pointing out that Hefford\u2019s condition was rare and that her death was not caused by protein per se. This was true, but it is also true that there is a significant minority of the population for whom a high-protein diet is not advisable. For <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/improvement-hub/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2017/11/Chronic-Kidney-Disease-in-England-The-Human-and-Financial-Cost.pdf\">the 4.3% or more adults in the UK</a> who have chronic kidney disease, a large amount of protein from red meat can damage renal function.</p> <p>Above and beyond its long-term effects on the body, a fixation with protein can become a form of eating disorder. Three years ago, the American psychologist Richard Achiro decided to study men in Los Angeles engaging in excessive use of protein powders as well as other supplements such as caffeine. Achiro conducted a survey of nearly 200 active men who were using workout supplements and found that, for many of them, protein use had become a \u201cvariant of disordered eating\u201d that threatened their health.</p> <p>These men felt under intense pressure to achieve bodies that were not just thin, but that exhibited a supposedly ideal ratio of fat to muscle. Three per cent of the sample group had been hospitalised as a result of excessive supplement use, yet they still viewed supplements as healthy. Eating disorders have complex causes: Achiro told me the men who were overusing protein supplements also tended to be suffering from body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem and a sense of insecurity about their own masculinity.</p> <p>But they were not helped by the fact that the culture they lived in told them that when they replaced most of their meals with protein shakes, what they were doing was normal. Achiro found that it was hard for these men to recognise that their relationship with protein might have become a problem, \u201cbecause those of us living in western society have been groomed to view a protein-rich diet as the apex of healthful eating\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>By 2001, Arla Foods, a vast European dairy cooperative with Danish headquarters, had used up all of the whey in Denmark. The company realised it would have to look further afield to meet the insatiable demand for whey protein. Arla signed a contract with SanCor, an Argentinian dairy company, to build a giant whey protein plant in the town of Porte\u00f1a, to the north of Buenos Aires. When you order \u201cwarm protein pancakes\u201d with blueberries at the gym, the odds are the protein will have come from a plant such as this.</p> <p>It was David Jenkins, a Scottish track and field athlete and silver medallist at the Munich Olympics, who first had the idea of marketing whey protein as a \u201crecovery optimiser\u201d for athletes called ProOptibol. It was launched in health food stores in Southern California and Hawaii in early 1988. At first it was a niche product that found popularity among cyclists and triathletes. The formula for this original whey protein was called WPC 75. It was a byproduct from the Golden Cheese company, based in Corona, California \u2013 a giant factory that produced Monterey Jack and other American cheeses.</p> <p>In just a few decades, whey protein has gone from waste product to aspirational lifestyle enhancer. Whey is the watery stuff left over during cheese-making after the curds are separated off. On traditional dairy farms, it was put to good use in anything from bread-making to pickles, but in the vast American cheese factories of the postwar years it came to be seen as an unwanted nuisance. In US dairy states such as Wisconsin, cheese factories dumped thousands of litres of whey in nearby rivers. It was only in the 1970s, after local authorities placed limits on the dumping of dairy waste, that cheese manufacturers realised they had to find a way to use up this annoying whey. The quality of whey powders \u2013 known as \u201cpopcorn whey\u201d \u2013 was poor, and it was mostly used to feed pigs. The key technology that made whey protein possible was the development of ultrafiltration techniques to pre-concentrate the whey before it was dried. This was when whey protein started to be made on an industrial scale.</p> <p>There is nothing on the average tub of whey protein to suggest it ever came from cheese, let alone from a cow. Whey manufacturers work on the assumption that consumers want it to be as close as possible to flavourless, to preserve the illusion that it is some kind of magic potion for humans. In its unadorned form, however, whey varies considerably in flavour. There are two kinds of whey: sweet whey made from rennet cheeses such as cheddar and mozzarella, and acid whey made from the likes of cottage cheese. Cheddar whey has a tendency to taste cardboardy, mozzarella whey is milky and whey from cottage cheese can be sour or reminiscent of cabbage broth. But in the finished product, all these flavours are evened out and disguised by the cloying scent of chocolate, artificial vanillin or salted caramel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5eb95a2ab646210f37f7e25df639bb3b02fece75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eb95a2ab646210f37f7e25df639bb3b02fece75/0_884_3013_1807/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A selection of energy bars in a supermarket in New York, US.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A selection of energy bars in a supermarket in New York, US.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Levine/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dairy whey protein has become a commodity that travels the world in 100kg sacks, generating vast profits, coordinated by GVCs (global value chains). Thanks to the shifting patterns of supply and demand, the protein shake a gymgoer in Tokyo drinks after lifting weights may have originated on a farm in Norway. The lowest-quality whey powder is called \u201cpermeate\u201d and is mostly shipped to Asia, where it is made into infant formula. The higher-quality whey, called WPC 80 because it has an 80% protein content, travels the world to fuel our protein obsession. The global whey protein market is now a complex and hugely competitive global trade, forecast to reach $14.5bn by the year 2023: more than half as much as the global market in breakfast cereal.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Strolling through London at lunchtime a few weeks ago, I found myself walking down Bread Street, near St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, which in medieval times was the site of the city\u2019s bread market. Turning off Bread Street, I came upon a branch of Protein Haus, which claims to sell the \u201cmost amazing protein shakes you will ever taste\u201d. The shakes have names such as Strawberry Warrior and Vegan Coffee Pump and Berry-Yatric, which must be a competitor for the most offensive food name ever. Protein Haus also sells protein foods such as \u201cbliss balls\u201d and indiscriminate steaming portions of various meats.</p> <p>From Bread Street to Protein Haus \u2013 this sums up how our eating habits have changed in modern times. When I was in Protein Haus staring at the heaps of overcooked chicken, slabs of salmon and rows of whey protein shakes and vegan protein shakes, it suddenly occurred to me how crazy it is that we should treat all of these varied \u201cprotein\u201d substances as if they were in some way identical. A scoop of ultra-processed whey is not, in fact, the same as a grilled salmon fillet, either in nutrition or in the experience of eating it. Salmon \u2013 even the farmed kind \u2013 will be high in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B12, whereas whey protein is low in vitamins and minerals (except for calcium) and fat-free. The only thing these foods have in common is that they tend to be fuel first and pleasure later (if at all).</p> <p>At the same time, our reverence for protein as the one perfect nutrient tends to completely ignore how the protein we eat is produced, or what the environmental consequences of that production might be. Of the 90g of protein eaten each day by the average American, two-thirds is composed of animal products. </p> <p>One irony of Britain\u2019s obsession with protein is that we don\u2019t actually produce very much of it. In fact, only 3% of arable land in Europe is given over to protein crops such as pulses, and Europe imports more than two-thirds of its animal feed. Much of the protein consumed in Europe is meat raised on materials that actually originate in South America or the US as soybean oil or other oilseeds and have to be shipped across the world. So long as we largely consume protein from animal sources, our obsession with protein is also likely to be bad for the planet.</p> <p>At the end of September, at the Aldeburgh food festival in Suffolk, I had a lunch with Nick Saltmarsh, who runs Hodmedod, a company that works with British farmers to produce locally grown pulses. Saltmarsh told me he feels our mania for protein foods has gone so far that we sometimes can\u2019t recognise real protein when it is right in front of us.</p> <p>Vegetable proteins such as lentils and peas tend to be regarded as \u201clow-quality\u201d compared with meat, eggs and dairy. But Christopher Gardner, a professor of medicine at Stanford University, has argued that this \u201cquality\u201d argument is misleading. His great discovery was that all plant sources of protein \u2013 from peanuts to edamame beans \u2013 contain all essential amino acids. Admittedly they contain smaller concentrations of the amino acids than meat or eggs, but in the context of a plentiful and varied diet, this doesn\u2019t matter.</p> <p>The problem is partly that beans and lentils do not fit our tunnel-visioned conception of what protein is. Pulses such as lentils contain around 25% protein but also 25% carbohydrate \u2013 which makes them hard to categorise within the dogmatic categories of modern nutrition. Is the lentil a protein (good) or a carb (bad)?</p> <p>When Saltmarsh takes his product range to food fairs, he finds that bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts will sometimes pick up a packet of pea flour and say \u201cooh! Peas!\u201d \u2013 because pea protein has become fashionable as a vegan alternative to whey. \u201cBut when they see that it also contains carbohydrate, they put it down again,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Some now shun any meal or snack that can\u2019t be categorised as a \u201cprotein\u201d fix. But they aren\u2019t among the millions of people for whom a lack of protein is indeed a real and pressing problem \u2013 and who don\u2019t tend to be the ones browsing pea protein at fitness fairs.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The word protein derives from the ancient Greek <em>protos</em>, meaning first. When a Dutch scientist called GJ Mulder first brought the term into use, in 1838, he proposed \u2013 rightly, as it turns out \u2013 that protein was a crucial substance in all animal bodies. But new research suggests protein is required not just in an absolute sense, but in a particular ratio to the other nutrients in our diets.</p> <p>Going by official guidelines, as we\u2019ve seen, the average person has access to more than enough protein for general health. It turns out our perplexing protein obsession may actually be a symptom of a larger problem in our sugar-heavy modern diets: if it feels like we are not eating enough protein, it\u2019s because we\u2019re eating too much of everything else.</p> <p>In 2005, two biologists called David Raubenheimer and Stephen Simpson put forward the \u201cprotein leverage hypothesis\u201d, in which they argued that protein could be the missing link in the obesity crisis. Since the 1960s, the absolute level of protein consumed by the average westerner has not changed. What <em>has</em> changed is the ratio of protein in our diets.</p> <p>Because our overall calorie consumption has risen by 14%, the ratio of protein to carbohydrate and fat has significantly dropped. In 1961, the average American got around 14-15% of calories in the form of protein, whereas today it is 12.5%. This doesn\u2019t sound like a big drop, but Raubenheimer and Simpson\u2019s research suggests that even a small drop in the percentage of protein can have a big impact on eating behaviour \u2013 driving us to overeat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a03a2a767659dba85a8b23c6cc62bbc74bca095e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a03a2a767659dba85a8b23c6cc62bbc74bca095e/0_151_4784_2872/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Salmon steaks at a Carrefour supermarket in Calais, France.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Salmon steaks at a Carrefour supermarket in Calais, France.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like many other animals, humans have what biologists call a \u201cdominant appetite\u201d for protein. The biological drive for protein is so strong that a cricket who feels short of protein will resort to cannibalism. When a locust is short of protein, it will explore different food sources to redress the balance. Humans are neither as ruthless as crickets nor as prudent as locusts. When given access to a diet that is low on protein and heavy in carbs and fats, humans will binge, in an attempt to extract the protein they need.</p> <p>If many of us overeat, it could be partly because our bodies are desperately seeking out protein in a food environment flooded with refined wheat and oils and many kinds of sugar. As Raubenheimer and Simpson wrote in their startlingly original 2012 book <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9776.html\" title=\"\">The Nature of Nutrition</a>: \u201cDilution of protein in the diet by fat and carbohydrate drives excess consumption, perhaps more so in some individuals, life stages and populations than others.\u201d In other words, obesity may often really be hunger hiding in plain view.</p> <p>The urgent question raised by this research is how we can get our protein ratios back to a healthy level. Our current protein mania \u2013 encouraged by the food business and the whey protein industry \u2013 suggests that the answer is to supercharge our diets with a flood of added protein. But eating protein to excess comes with its own costs, the main one being that it tends to shorten the lifespan.</p> <p>A more effective way to concentrate protein in our diets, Raubenheimer and Simpson say, would be to keep our protein levels constant (assuming we have enough) but cut down on \u201cfat, sugar and other readily digested carbohydrates\u201d, which would allow us to reach the protein our bodies need at a lower level of calories. But given that sugar is poured into everything from bread to stir-fry sauces, this solution would require a radical restructuring of our food environment.</p> <p>Our protein needs do not remain constant over the human lifespan: 0.8g per kilogram of bodyweight may be enough for a twentysomething, but not for an octogenarian. If anyone needs extra protein, it is not fit young gymgoers, but old people \u2013 particularly those on low incomes who may struggle to buy or cook meals for themselves. Instead of protein bars for the young and rich, we need omelettes and chickpea soup for the old and poor. From the age of 50 onwards we progressively lose muscle and our protein requirements become higher, just as appetite tends to decline. Rates of protein malnutrition are alarmingly high among elderly people admitted to hospital.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/11/why-we-fell-for-clean-eating\">Why we fell for clean eating</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most of those who can afford to buy a \u201chigh-protein\u201d tuna plate are already well nourished in amino acids. By contrast, in these austere times, many hard-pressed eaters are forced into a kind of protein hunger by the economic circumstances of their lives. Think of the families who go to the chip shop and buy chips with no fish, or the person on universal credit living on plain pasta until the next cheque comes in. This is one reason there is a huge market for savoury snacks that taste like a ghostly echo of the hearty, protein-based meals of the past while consisting of little but refined carbs and oil: roast chicken flavour crisps, barbecue tortilla chips. Raubenheimer and Simpson\u2019s research suggests that the colossal market for these cheap snacks could be another symptom of a world in which \u2013 despite all those bars and shakes on the shelves \u2013 many are still hungry for protein.</p> <p>Behind the current protein hype, there is a kernel of truth. A deficit of protein is indeed part of the hugely complex puzzle of what\u2019s wrong with modern diets.

      "bodyText": "Are you getting enough protein? The question provides its own answer: if you are worrying about the amount of protein in your diet, then you are almost certainly eating more than enough. This is the paradox of our new protein obsession. For many people, protein has become a kind of secular unction: it instantly anoints any food with an aura of health and goodness. On the menu at the gym where I go, a salad ni\u00e7oise is now repackaged as \u201chigh-protein tuna\u201d. It comes without the usual capers or olives \u2013 those are items that merely add flavour, and who needs that? On Pinterest, the lifestyle-sharing site, you can now choose \u201cprotein\u201d as one of your interests in life, along with \u201ccute animals\u201d and \u201cinspirational quotes\u201d. In 2017, there were 64m Google searches for \u201cprotein\u201d. Anxiety about protein is one of the things that drives a person to drink a flask of vitamin-padded beige slurry and call it lunch. You merely need to visit a western supermarket today to see that many people regard protein as some kind of universal elixir \u2013 one food companies are profitably adding to anything they can. \u201cWhen the Box Says \u2018Protein\u2019, Shoppers Say \u2018I\u2019ll take it\u2019\u201d was the headline of a 2013 article in the Wall Street Journal. In addition to the ubiquitous protein balls, protein bars and protein shakes, you can now buy protein noodles, protein bagels, protein cookies and \u2013 wait for it \u2013 protein coffee. Even foods that are naturally high in protein such as cheese and yoghurt are sold in protein-boosted versions. Strangest of all might be \u201cprotein water\u201d \u2013 clear, fruit-flavoured drinks laced with whey protein, as if ordinary water was insufficiently healthy. Around half of all UK consumers are apparently seeking to add \u201cextra protein\u201d to their diets, according to market research from the cereal brand Weetabix \u2013 which has also cashed in on our hunger for protein. The protein version of Weetabix \u2013 a 24-pack of which costs 50p more than the same-sized pack of original Weetabix \u2013 is worth \u00a37m in sales per year. In a way, there\u2019s nothing strange in the fact that we see protein as valuable, because it is. Along with fat and carbohydrate, it is one of the three basic macronutrients, and arguably the most important. We could survive without carbohydrates, but fat and protein are essential. Protein is the only macronutrient to contain nitrogen, without which we cannot grow or reproduce. There are nine amino-acid proteins \u2013 the building blocks of human tissue \u2013 that we can only get from food. Without them, we could grow neither healthy hair and nails nor strong bones and muscle, and our immune system would be impaired. A child who lacks vital protein in the first five years of life will suffer from stunting and sometimes wasting, too, as the dreadful persistence of malnutrition in the developing world reminds us. So the puzzle is not that we should crave protein, but that our protein anxiety has become so acute at a time when the average person in developed countries has a surfeit of protein in their diet \u2013 at least according to official guidelines, which recommend a minimum of 0.8g of protein a day per kilogram of body weight. According to 2015 data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the average person in the US and Canada gets a full 90g a day, a fifth more than the recommended amount (based on a normal North American adult weight of about 80kg). The average European is not far behind with 85g of protein a day, and the average Chinese person consumes 75g. When we seek out extra protein to sprinkle over our diets, most of us in rich countries are fixating on \u201ca problem that doesn\u2019t exist\u201d, said David L Katz, an American doctor and public health scholar who is the director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center. In his latest book, The Truth About Food, Katz notes that while the \u201cmythology of protein tends to propagate the notion that more is better\u201d, there are serious concerns that a very high protein intake over a lifetime can result in harm to the liver, kidneys and skeleton. The current protein mania has partly come about because so many people now regard carbohydrates or fats (and sometimes both) with suspicion. In the current nutrition wars, protein has emerged as the last macronutrient left standing. But the whole \u201cmacronutrient fixation\u201d is a \u201cboondoggle\u201d that has been calamitous for public health, Katz told me. \u201cFirst they told us to cut fat. But instead of wholegrains and lentils, we ate low-fat junk food.\u201d Then food marketers heard the message about cutting carbs and sold us protein-enriched junk foods instead. \u201cWhen we talk about protein,\u201d said Katz, \u201cwe are dissociating the nutrient from its food source.\u201d And yet still we try to get more protein. In this world of abundance, humans seem to be on an eternal quest for the one safe substance that we can consume in limitless quantities without gaining weight. Such is the appeal of Diet Coke. Our protein anxiety drives us to take diets already high in meats, soya, sugars and ultra-processed foods and dose them with yet more meats, soya, sugary bars and ultra-processed foods because they are marketed to us as \u201cprotein\u201d \u2013 even though many of these products are not even particularly high in protein. There is something paradoxical about our collective protein worship. When we pay good money for protein-enhanced food, we hope it will lead us to better health (however that is defined). Yet our single-minded pursuit of protein \u2013 as a disembodied nutrient whose presence trumps all other considerations \u2013 can lead us to behave as if we have forgotten everything we knew about food. * * * The intensity of our protein obsession can only be understood as part of a wider series of diet battles that go back half a century. If we now thirst for protein as if it were water, it may be because the other two macronutrients \u2013 fats and carbohydrates \u2013 have each in turn been made to seem toxic in the public mind. Official dietary guidelines in the US and UK still insist that a healthy diet is one founded on plenty of carbohydrates with limited quantities of fat, especially saturated fat. The rationale for this low-fat advice goes back to the landmark Seven Countries Study, conducted in the 1950s by the American physiologist Ancel Keys. Based on his observation of healthy, olive oil-eating Mediterranean populations, Keys argued that affluent westerners would suffer fewer cases of heart disease if they could limit consumption of saturated fats such as those found in butter, lard and meat. But as interpreted in the modern supermarket, the low-fat diet often ended up being a high-sugar and high-refined-carbohydrate diet, which was not quite what nutritionists had originally envisaged. In recent years, the low-fat, high-carb orthodoxy has come under fierce attack. In 2015, a meta-analysis conducted by a team of Canadian researchers concluded that intake of saturated fat was not associated with raised risk of stroke, type 2 diabetes or death from heart disease. Vocal anti-sugar campaigners such as Gary Taubes \u2013 author of The Case Against Sugar \u2013 have argued that the true cause of our current epidemic of diet-related ill health is not in fact saturated fat, but refined carbohydrate. While the low-fattists and the low-carbists continue to slug it out, protein comes out the winner as the one safe thing that most of the population feel they can still put their faith in, whether for weight loss or general health. We have to eat something, after all. The current protein fetish is merely the latest manifestation of a far larger phenomenon that Michael Pollan memorably referred to as \u201cnutritionism\u201d around 10 years ago. For decades now, there has been a tendency to think about what we eat and drink in terms of nutrients, rather than real whole ingredients in all their complexity. A combination of diet fads and clever marketing has got us here. It doesn\u2019t matter whether we fixate on \u201clow fat\u201d or \u201clow carbs\u201d or \u201chigh protein\u201d \u2013 we are making the same old mistakes about nutrition in a new form. * * * For a while, on my kitchen counter, next to the jars of rice and flour, there was another canister made of black plastic, much larger than the others. Its label said \u201cSOURCE OF HIGH QUALITY PROTEINS\u201d in huge letters. In much smaller lettering it said \u201cREADY TO MIX PROTEIN POWDER WITH SWEETENERS\u201d and listed three kinds of whey protein: whey protein isolate, whey protein concentrate and hydrolysed whey protein. When you opened it, a fake vanilla smell wafted into the air and you saw a whitish powder and a black plastic scoop. This soulless canister of ultra-processed whey protein was something that I, as a food writer, never thought I would see in my kitchen. The macho aesthetic of the packaging made my heart sink. I am also no fan of artificial sweeteners, which I believe do no favours either to the palate or to gut bacteria. What\u2019s more, I believe most people should be able to get the nutrients we need from a balanced diet, rather than through supplements. But nothing forces you to bend your own principles like parenthood. I turned to whey protein in a state of mild desperation for my very tall youngest son, who plays competitive sport five or six days a week. Three square meals plus multiple snacks only scratched the surface of his appetite, and he was sometimes almost crying with hunger by dinnertime. My conversations with other sport parents suggest that it\u2019s not uncommon to be at least a little bit obsessed with their child\u2019s protein intake. We grumble that protein bars are a pointless rip-off \u2013 and then we buy another pack of them. Protein means different things to different people. To some, it symbolises \u201cweight loss\u201d, while to others it means \u201cmuscles\u201d. To me it appeared as a magical filling substance that just might help my son to be less ravenous. I had read studies suggesting protein was the most filling \u2013 or satiating \u2013 of the three macronutrients, and wondered if more protein at breakfast could be the answer. I tried him on homemade waffles enriched with almonds and hidden eggs (at that point he wouldn\u2019t countenance whole eggs) and the improvement in his energy levels was dramatic. It was a short step to making him occasional smoothies from half a scoop of whey protein with milk and bananas or frozen berries. Despite my unease at the powder, I could genuinely see the difference in his levels of fullness. When the canister was empty I didn\u2019t replace it, but I still monitor my son\u2019s protein intake. Having \u201cenough\u201d protein in your diet to meet your basic needs is not necessarily the same as having the right amount for optimum health. When I asked David Katz how much protein a person should consume, he said certain people may indeed require more than the minimum recommendation of 0.8g per kilo of bodyweight \u2013 including athletes like my son. The problem is that once we start thinking more protein is automatically better, it can be hard to know when to stop. The idea that protein is synonymous with healthy eating leads many people to eat in disordered ways that are far from healthy, either for body or mind. A couple of years ago, Sarah Shephard, a thirtysomething British sports journalist, realised she was obsessed with protein. On a typical day, she was eating three or four protein bars, hard-boiled eggs, meat, fish and non-starchy vegetables and a couple of protein shakes. Virtually the only carbs in her diet came from the protein bars and shakes. It reached the point where she had so little energy in the evenings because of the lack of calories in her body that she stopped going out. Shephard\u2019s protein obsession started when injury forced her to give up running. After she started doing boxing and circuits with a new trainer, he told her she should be eating more protein to help prevent future injuries. To start with, Shephard\u2019s new low-carb, high-protein regime felt wonderful. She lost weight, gained muscle and became one of the many people at the gym clutching their sleek flask of protein shake like an amulet. However, she noticed her thoughts about protein were becoming obsessive. Given the choice between an apple and a protein bar, she always chose the protein bar, even though at a rational level she knew that a piece of fresh fruit with its fibre and vitamins had a lot to recommend it over a processed snack. By the time she finally sought help from a sports nutritionist, he said he had never seen anyone with such an intensive fitness regime who ate so little carbohydrate. She was consuming 150g of protein a day, around 2.5g per kilo of bodyweight \u2013 far in excess of the upper limit recommended for bodybuilders by the US Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Shephard slowly weaned herself back on to a more balanced diet that included a range of complex carbohydrates such as oats and brown rice. Despite her apprehension, she did not gain weight. When I spoke to her, Shephard had been eating a balanced diet for more than two years without any ill effects, and was a bit mystified as to how she had drifted into her protein fixation. Encouraged by the marketers of high-protein foods, many people talk about whether we we have reached our daily target for \u201cmacros\u201d, but we do not talk so much about how much is too much. Adding extra protein beyond our needs can be harmful for people with underlying kidney or liver problems, as the body can struggle to process the excess. In 2017 there were sensationalist headlines around the world when Meegan Hefford, a 25-year-old Australian bodybuilder, died after consuming high amounts of protein shakes and supplements. Hefford hadn\u2019t realised she was suffering from a condition called urea cycle disorder, which meant that her body couldn\u2019t metabolise protein normally. Defenders of high-protein diets immediately attacked the coverage of the story, pointing out that Hefford\u2019s condition was rare and that her death was not caused by protein per se. This was true, but it is also true that there is a significant minority of the population for whom a high-protein diet is not advisable. For the 4.3% or more adults in the UK who have chronic kidney disease, a large amount of protein from red meat can damage renal function. Above and beyond its long-term effects on the body, a fixation with protein can become a form of eating disorder. Three years ago, the American psychologist Richard Achiro decided to study men in Los Angeles engaging in excessive use of protein powders as well as other supplements such as caffeine. Achiro conducted a survey of nearly 200 active men who were using workout supplements and found that, for many of them, protein use had become a \u201cvariant of disordered eating\u201d that threatened their health. These men felt under intense pressure to achieve bodies that were not just thin, but that exhibited a supposedly ideal ratio of fat to muscle. Three per cent of the sample group had been hospitalised as a result of excessive supplement use, yet they still viewed supplements as healthy. Eating disorders have complex causes: Achiro told me the men who were overusing protein supplements also tended to be suffering from body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem and a sense of insecurity about their own masculinity. But they were not helped by the fact that the culture they lived in told them that when they replaced most of their meals with protein shakes, what they were doing was normal. Achiro found that it was hard for these men to recognise that their relationship with protein might have become a problem, \u201cbecause those of us living in western society have been groomed to view a protein-rich diet as the apex of healthful eating\u201d. * * * By 2001, Arla Foods, a vast European dairy cooperative with Danish headquarters, had used up all of the whey in Denmark. The company realised it would have to look further afield to meet the insatiable demand for whey protein. Arla signed a contract with SanCor, an Argentinian dairy company, to build a giant whey protein plant in the town of Porte\u00f1a, to the north of Buenos Aires. When you order \u201cwarm protein pancakes\u201d with blueberries at the gym, the odds are the protein will have come from a plant such as this. It was David Jenkins, a Scottish track and field athlete and silver medallist at the Munich Olympics, who first had the idea of marketing whey protein as a \u201crecovery optimiser\u201d for athletes called ProOptibol. It was launched in health food stores in Southern California and Hawaii in early 1988. At first it was a niche product that found popularity among cyclists and triathletes. The formula for this original whey protein was called WPC 75. It was a byproduct from the Golden Cheese company, based in Corona, California \u2013 a giant factory that produced Monterey Jack and other American cheeses. In just a few decades, whey protein has gone from waste product to aspirational lifestyle enhancer. Whey is the watery stuff left over during cheese-making after the curds are separated off. On traditional dairy farms, it was put to good use in anything from bread-making to pickles, but in the vast American cheese factories of the postwar years it came to be seen as an unwanted nuisance. In US dairy states such as Wisconsin, cheese factories dumped thousands of litres of whey in nearby rivers. It was only in the 1970s, after local authorities placed limits on the dumping of dairy waste, that cheese manufacturers realised they had to find a way to use up this annoying whey. The quality of whey powders \u2013 known as \u201cpopcorn whey\u201d \u2013 was poor, and it was mostly used to feed pigs. The key technology that made whey protein possible was the development of ultrafiltration techniques to pre-concentrate the whey before it was dried. This was when whey protein started to be made on an industrial scale. There is nothing on the average tub of whey protein to suggest it ever came from cheese, let alone from a cow. Whey manufacturers work on the assumption that consumers want it to be as close as possible to flavourless, to preserve the illusion that it is some kind of magic potion for humans. In its unadorned form, however, whey varies considerably in flavour. There are two kinds of whey: sweet whey made from rennet cheeses such as cheddar and mozzarella, and acid whey made from the likes of cottage cheese. Cheddar whey has a tendency to taste cardboardy, mozzarella whey is milky and whey from cottage cheese can be sour or reminiscent of cabbage broth. But in the finished product, all these flavours are evened out and disguised by the cloying scent of chocolate, artificial vanillin or salted caramel. Dairy whey protein has become a commodity that travels the world in 100kg sacks, generating vast profits, coordinated by GVCs (global value chains). Thanks to the shifting patterns of supply and demand, the protein shake a gymgoer in Tokyo drinks after lifting weights may have originated on a farm in Norway. The lowest-quality whey powder is called \u201cpermeate\u201d and is mostly shipped to Asia, where it is made into infant formula. The higher-quality whey, called WPC 80 because it has an 80% protein content, travels the world to fuel our protein obsession. The global whey protein market is now a complex and hugely competitive global trade, forecast to reach $14.5bn by the year 2023: more than half as much as the global market in breakfast cereal. * * * Strolling through London at lunchtime a few weeks ago, I found myself walking down Bread Street, near St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, which in medieval times was the site of the city\u2019s bread market. Turning off Bread Street, I came upon a branch of Protein Haus, which claims to sell the \u201cmost amazing protein shakes you will ever taste\u201d. The shakes have names such as Strawberry Warrior and Vegan Coffee Pump and Berry-Yatric, which must be a competitor for the most offensive food name ever. Protein Haus also sells protein foods such as \u201cbliss balls\u201d and indiscriminate steaming portions of various meats. From Bread Street to Protein Haus \u2013 this sums up how our eating habits have changed in modern times. When I was in Protein Haus staring at the heaps of overcooked chicken, slabs of salmon and rows of whey protein shakes and vegan protein shakes, it suddenly occurred to me how crazy it is that we should treat all of these varied \u201cprotein\u201d substances as if they were in some way identical. A scoop of ultra-processed whey is not, in fact, the same as a grilled salmon fillet, either in nutrition or in the experience of eating it. Salmon \u2013 even the farmed kind \u2013 will be high in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B12, whereas whey protein is low in vitamins and minerals (except for calcium) and fat-free. The only thing these foods have in common is that they tend to be fuel first and pleasure later (if at all). At the same time, our reverence for protein as the one perfect nutrient tends to completely ignore how the protein we eat is produced, or what the environmental consequences of that production might be. Of the 90g of protein eaten each day by the average American, two-thirds is composed of animal products. One irony of Britain\u2019s obsession with protein is that we don\u2019t actually produce very much of it. In fact, only 3% of arable land in Europe is given over to protein crops such as pulses, and Europe imports more than two-thirds of its animal feed. Much of the protein consumed in Europe is meat raised on materials that actually originate in South America or the US as soybean oil or other oilseeds and have to be shipped across the world. So long as we largely consume protein from animal sources, our obsession with protein is also likely to be bad for the planet. At the end of September, at the Aldeburgh food festival in Suffolk, I had a lunch with Nick Saltmarsh, who runs Hodmedod, a company that works with British farmers to produce locally grown pulses. Saltmarsh told me he feels our mania for protein foods has gone so far that we sometimes can\u2019t recognise real protein when it is right in front of us. Vegetable proteins such as lentils and peas tend to be regarded as \u201clow-quality\u201d compared with meat, eggs and dairy. But Christopher Gardner, a professor of medicine at Stanford University, has argued that this \u201cquality\u201d argument is misleading. His great discovery was that all plant sources of protein \u2013 from peanuts to edamame beans \u2013 contain all essential amino acids. Admittedly they contain smaller concentrations of the amino acids than meat or eggs, but in the context of a plentiful and varied diet, this doesn\u2019t matter. The problem is partly that beans and lentils do not fit our tunnel-visioned conception of what protein is. Pulses such as lentils contain around 25% protein but also 25% carbohydrate \u2013 which makes them hard to categorise within the dogmatic categories of modern nutrition. Is the lentil a protein (good) or a carb (bad)? When Saltmarsh takes his product range to food fairs, he finds that bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts will sometimes pick up a packet of pea flour and say \u201cooh! Peas!\u201d \u2013 because pea protein has become fashionable as a vegan alternative to whey. \u201cBut when they see that it also contains carbohydrate, they put it down again,\u201d he said. Some now shun any meal or snack that can\u2019t be categorised as a \u201cprotein\u201d fix. But they aren\u2019t among the millions of people for whom a lack of protein is indeed a real and pressing problem \u2013 and who don\u2019t tend to be the ones browsing pea protein at fitness fairs. * * * The word protein derives from the ancient Greek protos, meaning first. When a Dutch scientist called GJ Mulder first brought the term into use, in 1838, he proposed \u2013 rightly, as it turns out \u2013 that protein was a crucial substance in all animal bodies. But new research suggests protein is required not just in an absolute sense, but in a particular ratio to the other nutrients in our diets. Going by official guidelines, as we\u2019ve seen, the average person has access to more than enough protein for general health. It turns out our perplexing protein obsession may actually be a symptom of a larger problem in our sugar-heavy modern diets: if it feels like we are not eating enough protein, it\u2019s because we\u2019re eating too much of everything else. In 2005, two biologists called David Raubenheimer and Stephen Simpson put forward the \u201cprotein leverage hypothesis\u201d, in which they argued that protein could be the missing link in the obesity crisis. Since the 1960s, the absolute level of protein consumed by the average westerner has not changed. What has changed is the ratio of protein in our diets. Because our overall calorie consumption has risen by 14%, the ratio of protein to carbohydrate and fat has significantly dropped. In 1961, the average American got around 14-15% of calories in the form of protein, whereas today it is 12.5%. This doesn\u2019t sound like a big drop, but Raubenheimer and Simpson\u2019s research suggests that even a small drop in the percentage of protein can have a big impact on eating behaviour \u2013 driving us to overeat. Like many other animals, humans have what biologists call a \u201cdominant appetite\u201d for protein. The biological drive for protein is so strong that a cricket who feels short of protein will resort to cannibalism. When a locust is short of protein, it will explore different food sources to redress the balance. Humans are neither as ruthless as crickets nor as prudent as locusts. When given access to a diet that is low on protein and heavy in carbs and fats, humans will binge, in an attempt to extract the protein they need. If many of us overeat, it could be partly because our bodies are desperately seeking out protein in a food environment flooded with refined wheat and oils and many kinds of sugar. As Raubenheimer and Simpson wrote in their startlingly original 2012 book The Nature of Nutrition: \u201cDilution of protein in the diet by fat and carbohydrate drives excess consumption, perhaps more so in some individuals, life stages and populations than others.\u201d In other words, obesity may often really be hunger hiding in plain view. The urgent question raised by this research is how we can get our protein ratios back to a healthy level. Our current protein mania \u2013 encouraged by the food business and the whey protein industry \u2013 suggests that the answer is to supercharge our diets with a flood of added protein. But eating protein to excess comes with its own costs, the main one being that it tends to shorten the lifespan. A more effective way to concentrate protein in our diets, Raubenheimer and Simpson say, would be to keep our protein levels constant (assuming we have enough) but cut down on \u201cfat, sugar and other readily digested carbohydrates\u201d, which would allow us to reach the protein our bodies need at a lower level of calories. But given that sugar is poured into everything from bread to stir-fry sauces, this solution would require a radical restructuring of our food environment. Our protein needs do not remain constant over the human lifespan: 0.8g per kilogram of bodyweight may be enough for a twentysomething, but not for an octogenarian. If anyone needs extra protein, it is not fit young gymgoers, but old people \u2013 particularly those on low incomes who may struggle to buy or cook meals for themselves. Instead of protein bars for the young and rich, we need omelettes and chickpea soup for the old and poor. From the age of 50 onwards we progressively lose muscle and our protein requirements become higher, just as appetite tends to decline. Rates of protein malnutrition are alarmingly high among elderly people admitted to hospital. Most of those who can afford to buy a \u201chigh-protein\u201d tuna plate are already well nourished in amino acids. By contrast, in these austere times, many hard-pressed eaters are forced into a kind of protein hunger by the economic circumstances of their lives. Think of the families who go to the chip shop and buy chips with no fish, or the person on universal credit living on plain pasta until the next cheque comes in. This is one reason there is a huge market for savoury snacks that taste like a ghostly echo of the hearty, protein-based meals of the past while consisting of little but refined carbs and oil: roast chicken flavour crisps, barbecue tortilla chips. Raubenheimer and Simpson\u2019s research suggests that the colossal market for these cheap snacks could be another symptom of a world in which \u2013 despite all those bars and shakes on the shelves \u2013 many are still hungry for protein. Behind the current protein hype, there is a kernel of truth. A deficit of protein is indeed part of the hugely complex puzzle of what\u2019s wrong with modern diets. The problem is that the right question \u2013 am I getting enough protein? \u2013 is being asked by the wrong people.

      "bodyText": "It has been two weeks since 25% of the US government shut down because of a funding row over Donald Trump\u2019s demands for $5bn for a wall on the southern border. And federal employees and contractors who cannot go to work are feeling the impact. More than 800,000 people across the country have been affected by the impasse, with some on unpaid leave, and others working without pay, but many calculating how to pay the bills and buy groceries as the shutdown stretches on. John Deal, a Nasa contractor who lives in Virginia, told the Guardian on Christmas Day that he and his wife \u2013 who also works for the agency \u2013 have lost 100% of their household income since the shutdown began. One of his daughters lives at home, and is helping pay for groceries from her first year teacher\u2019s salary. \u201cWe\u2019re blue-collar workers. We\u2019re not making six-figure salaries like Mr Trump or Mr Pence,\u201d he said this week. Deal said he and his wife are using vacation days to keep money coming in for the moment, but the family\u2019s mortgage payment is coming up. There is still no end in sight for the partial shutdown that was triggered on 22 December after the president\u2019s demand for more than $5bn funding to build the wall, a core campaign promise. Republicans have so far rejected a proposal from Democrats for a funding bill that would reopen the government, but doesn\u2019t offer funds for a wall. Just hours before the swearing-in of the new Congress on Thursday, Trump tweeted, blaming the shutdown on the 2020 election. He had initially claimed full responsibility, saying, a week before the shutdown: \u201cSo I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down.\u201d The Office of Personnel Management, the agency overseeing federal workers, sent out sample letters last week, along with suggestions, for employees to negotiate lower rents during the furlough period. One suggested letter reads: \u201cAs we discussed, I am a federal employee who has recently been furloughed due to a lack of funding of my agency. Because of this, my income has been severely cut and I am unable to pay the entire cost of my mortgage, along with my other expenses.\u201d In Detroit, Colleen Regan, 31, a federal law enforcement agency employee, is living alone in a friend\u2019s basement as she waits out the end of this shutdown. With very little savings after moving for her job from Chicago, she is making do with the last paycheck she received. Regan said: \u201cI\u2019m also a wounded veteran so I draw a pension and it\u2019s enough to cover some of my bills but not all. Everyone says you should have managed your money better. It stinks.\u201d As soon as news of the shutdown broke, she ran to the grocery store and bought 20lb bag of rice and 10lb bag of potatoes to feed herself. She said: \u201cI can survive on very little, but once the bills hit this month, the money\u2019s going to be gone.\u201d Regan spends most of her time doing research around the shutdown and looking for potential temporary job options, but worries no one will hire someone in such an uncertain work situation. Others are documenting their accumulating days without a paycheck, still using the hashtag #shutdownstories. Since the start of the furlough, Sharon Stiteler, a national park ranger who has documented various furloughs in years past, tweets a diary entry of her day. On day 11, she posted: \u201cWondering if I\u2019m going back to work tomorrow \u2026 refresh news, refresh news, refresh news, refresh news, refresh news, refresh news, refresh news, refresh news, refresh news, refresh news, refresh news, refresh news, refresh news, refresh news, refresh news.\u201d US national parks have descended into chaos without the order of enforced by park rangers, and Joshua Tree in southern California was forced to close this week. Trash cans are swimming in garbage, and human feces pile up in public toilets, without workers there to oversee the cleanup. It also means that the already backlogged US immigration courts will experience further delays, as those with hearings who are not in detention \u201cwill be reset for a later date after funding resumes\u201d. The Smithsonian in Washington DC and the National Zoo are closed indefinitely. Essential staff will take care of the animals for now, most likely without pay, like the hundreds of thousands of other federal employees. Angel Stephensen, a transportation and security administration supervisor at Salt Lake City airport in Utah, has worked eight hours a day, five days a week in the last two weeks but has not been paid for her time.

Though some areas of American public life have consistently been ruled out of bounds to UN investigators \u2013 US prisons and the detention camp on Guant\u00e1namo Bay are deemed off-limits \u2013 Washington has in general welcomed monitors into the US as part of a wider commitment to upholding international norms.</p> <p>Jamil Dakwar, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s human rights program, said the shift gave the impression the US was no longer serious about honoring its own human rights obligations.

      "bodyText": "The Trump administration has stopped cooperating with UN investigators over potential human rights violations occurring inside America, in a move that delivers a major blow to vulnerable US communities and sends a dangerous signal to authoritarian regimes around the world. Quietly and unnoticed, the state department has ceased to respond to official complaints from UN special rapporteurs, the network of independent experts who act as global watchdogs on fundamental issues such as poverty, migration, freedom of expression and justice. There has been no response to any such formal query since 7 May 2018, with at least 13 requests going unanswered. Nor has the Trump administration extended any invitation to a UN monitor to visit the US to investigate human rights inside the country since the start of Donald Trump\u2019s term two years ago in January 2017. Two UN experts have made official fact-finding visits under his watch \u2013 the special rapporteurs on extreme poverty and privacy \u2013 but both were invited initially by Barack Obama, who hosted 16 such visits during his presidency. The silent treatment being meted out to key players in the UN\u2019s system for advancing human rights marks a stark break with US practice going back decades. Though some areas of American public life have consistently been ruled out of bounds to UN investigators \u2013 US prisons and the detention camp on Guant\u00e1namo Bay are deemed off-limits \u2013 Washington has in general welcomed monitors into the US as part of a wider commitment to upholding international norms. Jamil Dakwar, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s human rights program, said the shift gave the impression the US was no longer serious about honoring its own human rights obligations. The ripple effect around the world would be dire. \u201cThey are sending a very dangerous message to other countries: that if you don\u2019t cooperate with UN experts they will just go away. That\u2019s a serious setback to the system created after World War II to ensure that domestic human rights violations could no longer be seen as an internal matter,\u201d Dakwar said. Among the formal approaches that have failed to receive a response from the US over the past several months are queries about family separation of Central Americans at the US border with Mexico, death threats against a transgender activist in Seattle and allegations of anti-gay bias in the sentencing to death of a prisoner in South Dakota. The new breach with international experts comes at a perilous moment for the US, both externally and within its own borders. Externally, Trump has forged an increasingly unilateral path on foreign policy: in June he shocked the world by pulling the US out of the UN human rights council, complaining it was a \u201ccesspool of political bias\u201d, and he has caused further consternation by siding with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, despite evidence linking Prince Mohammed to the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Domestically, Trump has run roughshod over the constitutional rights of asylum seekers at the US border, attempted to deny the legal existence of transgender people and introduced tax cuts that have greatly exacerbated income inequality in a country in which 40 million people live in poverty, among many other controversies. The timing of the break in relations with UN investigators coincides with the publication in June of the official findings of Philip Alston\u2019s visit to the US to research poverty. As UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty, Alston castigated the Trump administration for aggravating levels of inequality that were already the most glaring in the western world. Alston\u2019s robust criticism was received badly by Nikki Haley, then US ambassador, who accused him of biased reporting. She hinted that the administration was minded to turn its back on international accountability by saying it was \u201cpatently ridiculous\u201d that the UN should focus on America\u2019s internal human rights standards when it could be looking into countries like Burundi.

Nor are they arguing that what works for them will necessarily work for everyone \u2013 although anyone who has ever calmed themselves down at the end of a horrible day by stirring a risotto, deadheading a flowerbed or dragging the dog around the block can understand the value of doing something gentle, but just absorbing enough to distract from the problem at hand.</p> <p>However, once an acute episode of mental illness is over, many people need a means of living with what\u2019s so often left behind: a darkness pushed only to the corners of the room, and the knowledge that it could always come creeping back again. If you\u2019ve had one episode of depression or anxiety, it is best to be prepared for the possibility of another.</p> <p>For many people a chronic mental health condition is never quite cured so much as managed, by learning to recognise the early signs of the fog descending and doing whatever you can to stave it off. Hence the hunger for practical ways to keep yourself out of the doctor\u2019s surgery, which cost next to nothing and should be accessible to most people in possession of a saucepan or a pair of trainers, which this new genre of self-help books is tapping into.</p> <p>These writers may only be advocating what your granny would have called taking up a hobby, something to soothe and distract a troubled mind. But they are grappling on an individual level with an area all of us should perhaps be thinking harder about, since none of us know when we too might find ourselves poleaxed by a bereavement or a traumatic experience \u2013 and that\u2019s the preventive side of the mental health argument. If we know now reasonably well what keeps people physically fit \u2013 moving more, eating less, staying socially connected into old age \u2013 we\u2019re only scratching the surface of what might make people more mentally resilient.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/nov/14/david-cameron-wellbeing-inquiry\" title=\"\">David Cameron</a> was mocked a decade ago for raising the concept of general wellbeing, or the idea that politicians should seek to raise and sustain the happiness of the nation in the same concerted way they have traditionally sought to raise GDP. But while all that was blown away by his government\u2019s response to the financial crash, the idea of treating happiness as a serious and legitimate political goal remains an interesting one.</p> <p>Beneath the all-enveloping fog of Brexit there are glimmerings of renewed interest in the politics of wellbeing, from the government\u2019s creation of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/14/loneliness-social-prescribing-theresa-may\" title=\"\">minister for tackling loneliness</a> (inspired by the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/10/loneliness-is-a-giant-evil-of-our-time-says-jo-cox-commission\" title=\"\">Jo Cox</a> MP) to shadow chancellor John McDonnell\u2019s interest in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/09/john-mcdonnell-shapes-labour-case-for-four-day-week\" title=\"\">shortening the working week</a>. The argument is that by working less, and giving people more time to relax and do whatever drains the stresses from their lives, we could ultimately become a more productive nation. Or at least we might, so long as we didn\u2019t fritter away all that extra free time in staring at a smartphone.</p> <p>But the missing link in the jigsaw is connecting what has always sounded like a rather vague and fuzzy happiness agenda \u2013 nice to have, obviously, but hardly urgent \u2013 to the emerging scale of Britain\u2019s mental health problem. Viewed through that particular lens, the pursuit of happiness begins to sound anything but trivial. It\u2019s good to be reminded that, sometimes, happiness is in the small things. But it may take bigger changes in national life before everyone has the time and freedom to pursue them.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Nor are they arguing that what works for them will necessarily work for everyone \u2013 although anyone who has ever calmed themselves down at the end of a horrible day by stirring a risotto, deadheading a flowerbed or dragging the dog around the block can understand the value of doing something gentle, but just absorbing enough to distract from the problem at hand. However, once an acute episode of mental illness is over, many people need a means of living with what\u2019s so often left behind: a darkness pushed only to the corners of the room, and the knowledge that it could always come creeping back again. If you\u2019ve had one episode of depression or anxiety, it is best to be prepared for the possibility of another. For many people a chronic mental health condition is never quite cured so much as managed, by learning to recognise the early signs of the fog descending and doing whatever you can to stave it off. Hence the hunger for practical ways to keep yourself out of the doctor\u2019s surgery, which cost next to nothing and should be accessible to most people in possession of a saucepan or a pair of trainers, which this new genre of self-help books is tapping into. These writers may only be advocating what your granny would have called taking up a hobby, something to soothe and distract a troubled mind. But they are grappling on an individual level with an area all of us should perhaps be thinking harder about, since none of us know when we too might find ourselves poleaxed by a bereavement or a traumatic experience \u2013 and that\u2019s the preventive side of the mental health argument. If we know now reasonably well what keeps people physically fit \u2013 moving more, eating less, staying socially connected into old age \u2013 we\u2019re only scratching the surface of what might make people more mentally resilient. David Cameron was mocked a decade ago for raising the concept of general wellbeing, or the idea that politicians should seek to raise and sustain the happiness of the nation in the same concerted way they have traditionally sought to raise GDP. But while all that was blown away by his government\u2019s response to the financial crash, the idea of treating happiness as a serious and legitimate political goal remains an interesting one. Beneath the all-enveloping fog of Brexit there are glimmerings of renewed interest in the politics of wellbeing, from the government\u2019s creation of a minister for tackling loneliness (inspired by the work of Jo Cox MP) to shadow chancellor John McDonnell\u2019s interest in shortening the working week. The argument is that by working less, and giving people more time to relax and do whatever drains the stresses from their lives, we could ultimately become a more productive nation. Or at least we might, so long as we didn\u2019t fritter away all that extra free time in staring at a smartphone. But the missing link in the jigsaw is connecting what has always sounded like a rather vague and fuzzy happiness agenda \u2013 nice to have, obviously, but hardly urgent \u2013 to the emerging scale of Britain\u2019s mental health problem. Viewed through that particular lens, the pursuit of happiness begins to sound anything but trivial. It\u2019s good to be reminded that, sometimes, happiness is in the small things. But it may take bigger changes in national life before everyone has the time and freedom to pursue them. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Buddhist monks in Japan have posted videos on social media to prove their traditional attire is no obstacle to safe driving after one of their brethren was fined. Police said an officer had stopped the unnamed monk, who is in his 40s, on a road in Fukui prefecture in western Japan earlier this year and told him he could not drive in his \u201cconstricting\u201d s\u014di robes. The officer issued him with a ticket that described him as \u201cdriving in a kimono that could affect safety\u201d and fined him 6,000 yen ($55). Recent news reports of the incident sparked a show of solidarity from fellow monks in a stunning display of asceticism-meets-athleticism. Several posted videos of themselves performing a series of activities \u2013 from juggling and skateboarding to skipping and playing the guitar \u2013 accompanied by the Japanese hashtag \u201cS\u014di de dekiru mon\u201d (I can do it in robes). Another clip shows a barefooted, shaven-headed man in robes wielding a Star Wars lightsaber. The clips prompted a wave of online praise for their agility, while some commenters wondered if the police were similarly unforgiving of drivers wearing long dresses. Others praised the monks for their show of resistance. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that the [I can do it in robes hashtag] taught me, it\u2019s don\u2019t f**k with Japanese monks,\u201d wrote one Twitter user. Another encouraged his followers to \u201ccopy paste this hashtag to see the baddest monks on the planet sending a message to the Japanese police\u201d. The monk was on his way to a memorial service and was wearing robes that stretched below his knees, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun. The newspaper quoted him as saying that safety had been uppermost in his mind throughout his 20 years as a driver. His Kyoto-based order, meanwhile, has complained that strict enforcement of the traffic regulation on \u201cunsafe\u201d clothing could inhibit monks\u2019 ability to perform their religious duties. The monk\u2019s ordeal is not over, however.

A formal quota of 40:40:20 was adopted in 2012, to ensure that 40% of the positions were held by women.

The Liberal senator Jane Hume and the foreign minister, Marise Payne, responded by suggesting the party should do more for women but \u2013 again \u2013 stopped short of endorsing quotas. Ley told the Australian on Friday she believed \u201ca sensible number and date\u201d to increase the number of Liberal women needed to be implemented \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, to ensure the tide would be turned. Jason Falinksi became one of the first Liberal party male MPs to also publicly call for more diversity. So far, just 21 female candidates have been preselected by the Liberal party to run in the next election. After Sarah Henderson and Linda Reynolds began the week attempting to defend the Liberals\u2019 record on female representation \u2013 both within the party and as a government \u2013 as having done more than Labor, Plibersek led Labor\u2019s counter-charge. She said she found it \u201claughable\u201d that members of the government, where just 12 of its 74 lower house seats were held by women, were making those claims. The lack of change was \u201cdisappointing\u201d, she said, adding that there was no proof the \u201cmerit\u201d argument stood up, in light of some of the men who found themselves holding a seat. \u201cA parliament that is more representative of the Australian community makes better decisions for the whole Australian community,\u201d Plibersek said on Friday. \u201cIt is good that some Liberals are waking up to that fact. It would be terrific if the prime minister woke up to that fact. \u201c\u2026I think you only have to look at some of the Liberal blokes who have been elected to parliament to see that the merit principle plainly doesn\u2019t apply to Liberal party preselection. There are some pretty unimpressive characters there and if they are there on merit, I will eat my hat.\u201d On Friday Hume told the Australian that quotas are \u201cnot the answer\u201d because they are a \u201cLabor solution\u201d and her party should look for an unspecified \u201cLiberal alternative\u201d. \u201cWe need the parliamentary and organisational leadership, state and federal, to come together and start working on this,\u201d she reportedly said. \u201cIt cannot wait. It does not have to be a binary between quotas and nothing.\u201d At a press conference in Sydney, Payne said that \u201call options should be on the table\u201d to boost female representation but declined to state a personal position on quotas. Asked about low numbers of women in the party, Payne responded \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a science\u201d and suggested the party could \u201cwork collaboratively\u201d to boost women. Labor began instituting quotas in 1994, when it adopted the affirmative action policy, which targeted 35% of winnable electorates being preselected with female candidates by 2002, a process that began in the 1970s, when the party\u2019s lack of female representation was highlighted. A formal quota of 40:40:20 was adopted in 2012, to ensure that 40% of the positions were held by women. Labor has since worked towards a quota of 50%. But with that shift came allegations of \u201cquota girls\u201d, a term still bandied about by critics within the Coalition of a quota system. During the past week, Labor has been accused of using gender as a weapon for political gain, a claim Plibersek has rejected. \u201cI think it is incredible that anytime we speak about a parliament that looks more like the Australian community, we are accused of weaponising the gender issue or playing the gender card, and all these disparaging comments are made,\u201d she said. \u201cI think greater gender equality is obviously good for the women, but it is also good for men. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people in the Liberal party who are trying to shut down the debate, because they feel it is a debate that reflects badly on the women in the party itself. \u201cThis is not something that the Labor party has achieved overnight \u2026 it has taken decades to do this, it has taken a determined effort and it has taken a discussion within our own party.\u201d Plibersek said that if those who defended the Liberals\u2019 record were correct, they needed to explain how so few women ended up in the party room, and on its frontbench. \u201cIt cannot be that the Liberal party is lacking in female talent,\u201d she said. \u201cI have seen many talented, articulate Liberal women; somehow they don\u2019t get preselected. \u201cIt obviously, is a cultural thing within the party. And it is disappointing you have women in the Liberal party who aren\u2019t prepared to call it out. But what is more disappointing, frankly, is you have a prime minister who turns a blind eye to it.\u201d On current polls, the Liberal party could potentially be left with just six women in the lower house after the election.",

The two spoke to Guardian Australia about their friendship and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/06/race-politics-is-back-race-commissioner-exits-with-parting-shots-at-conservatives\">the rise in public racism they witnessed in 2018</a>.</p> \n<p>In 2015, when Curtis was murdered, Mohammed took the week off work and helped the Cheng family around the house.

That is just what you do.\u201d</p> \n<p>They had previously discussed, in an abstract way, Muslim extremism, but it was not a debate that changed after the Parramatta shooting.</p> \n<p>\u201cI remember having geopolitical, historical discussions around the roots of the Islam and west conflict, stemming from the crusades,\u201d Cheng says. \u201cElements of history like the golden ages of Islam and how that changed in terms of its relationship with the west and other minorities. I know Qais has an interest in that. I really enjoyed discussing it.</p> \n<p>\u201cNobody should ever go through what I have needed to go through, but there is a lot more to understand about extremism. That it is definitely not just because of religion. And I think that sometimes in the rhetoric of things, people don\u2019t want to hear about complexity. They don\u2019t want to hear that there are lots of layers to it.\u201d</p> \n<p>For both men, it was hard to see Anning trash that kind of nuance in parliament in August. The former One Nation senator used his maiden speech to call for a halt on Muslim immigration, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/14/australian-senator-calls-for-final-solution-to-immigration-problem\">an explicit return</a> to the \u201cpredominantly European immigration policy of the pre-Whitlam consensus\u201d (the White Australia Policy), and used the phrase \u201cfinal solution to the immigration issue\u201d, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/15/mps-widely-condemn-fraser-annings-final-solution-speech\">its loaded Nazi connotations</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6e2c0a27-6a8e-450b-8e16-c3ab5e49fc76\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-slfYHJ8b00?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cEvery time I read that, it hits me personally,\u201d Mohammed says. \u201cIt is that sense of \u2018I\u2019m no longer welcome.\u2019 When you see a speech like that, you walk down the street and people know that you\u2019re Muslim, you sort of think, well, do they look at me differently now? Australia is everything I have known and been raised in \u2026 Well what else do you have?\u201d</p> \n<p>For Cheng, Anning\u2019s speech was the spur to act. To the outside observer, the contrast was stark. Anning, the wannabe demagogue, had cited Isis and terrorism in his call for division. Cheng, who had suffered the reality of extremism, called for tolerance \u2013 a man who seemed to now spend his life constantly turning the other cheek.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>People always go, why are you not angry? Why are you not spouting hate?</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Alpha Cheng</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But it is not true that Cheng does not hate.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople always go, why are you not angry? Why are you not, you know, spouting hate? The thing is, for me, that is very private. And what people don\u2019t seem to know or realise is that it is incredibly challenging. It does hurt from time to time.\u201d</p> \n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/08/farhad-jabar-troubled-soft-spoken-boy-turned-into-killer\">Farhad Jabar murdered Cheng\u2019s father</a>, the CCTV caught him strutting on the street outside Parramatta police headquarters. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/18/talal-alameddine-jailed-for-17-years-for-supplying-gun-that-killed-curtis-cheng\">An 18-year-old had given him the gun.</a> He told a court that he did not feel sorry.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are in the middle of four court cases with people that are accused and being sentenced for their crimes and involvement,\u201d Cheng says. \u201cAnd I find it incredibly difficult to be in the same courtroom.

It would have been easy, but I guess I didn\u2019t take the easy way out.\u201d</p> \n<p>The two men don\u2019t spell it out but they have realised they took more care with their words when they wrote Curtis\u2019s eulogy than elected officials do on the floor of parliament.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the very early stage, within a week or two of when Dad died, Qais and other friends of mine were just sitting in a room, writing,\u201d says Cheng. \u201cKnowing that words that I have to say, matter.</p> \n<p>\u201cA lot of people say \u2018I can\u2019t do what you do.\u2019 That\u2019s where I get that sense that it would be so easy, because it seems like everyone says that\u2019s what they would do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mohammed now lives with his wife in London, and works in finance. Cheng, a teacher, lives in Canberra. He travels back to Sydney sometimes to have meetings and speak at community events. He also occasionally writes opinion pieces, after thinking about what to say because, if people are going to be listening, it matters to him that he gets it right.</p>",

He does not see it as a grand gesture. \u201cYou do as friends do,\u201d Mohammed says. \u201cThe time that Alpha went through, the worst days of his life, you offer any support that you can. That is just what you do.\u201d They had previously discussed, in an abstract way, Muslim extremism, but it was not a debate that changed after the Parramatta shooting. \u201cI remember having geopolitical, historical discussions around the roots of the Islam and west conflict, stemming from the crusades,\u201d Cheng says. \u201cElements of history like the golden ages of Islam and how that changed in terms of its relationship with the west and other minorities. I know Qais has an interest in that. I really enjoyed discussing it. \u201cNobody should ever go through what I have needed to go through, but there is a lot more to understand about extremism. That it is definitely not just because of religion. And I think that sometimes in the rhetoric of things, people don\u2019t want to hear about complexity. They don\u2019t want to hear that there are lots of layers to it.\u201d For both men, it was hard to see Anning trash that kind of nuance in parliament in August. The former One Nation senator used his maiden speech to call for a halt on Muslim immigration, an explicit return to the \u201cpredominantly European immigration policy of the pre-Whitlam consensus\u201d (the White Australia Policy), and used the phrase \u201cfinal solution to the immigration issue\u201d, with its loaded Nazi connotations. \u201cEvery time I read that, it hits me personally,\u201d Mohammed says. \u201cIt is that sense of \u2018I\u2019m no longer welcome.\u2019 When you see a speech like that, you walk down the street and people know that you\u2019re Muslim, you sort of think, well, do they look at me differently now? Australia is everything I have known and been raised in \u2026 Well what else do you have?\u201d For Cheng, Anning\u2019s speech was the spur to act. To the outside observer, the contrast was stark. Anning, the wannabe demagogue, had cited Isis and terrorism in his call for division. Cheng, who had suffered the reality of extremism, called for tolerance \u2013 a man who seemed to now spend his life constantly turning the other cheek. But it is not true that Cheng does not hate. \u201cPeople always go, why are you not angry? Why are you not, you know, spouting hate? The thing is, for me, that is very private. And what people don\u2019t seem to know or realise is that it is incredibly challenging. It does hurt from time to time.\u201d When Farhad Jabar murdered Cheng\u2019s father, the CCTV caught him strutting on the street outside Parramatta police headquarters. An 18-year-old had given him the gun. He told a court that he did not feel sorry. \u201cWe are in the middle of four court cases with people that are accused and being sentenced for their crimes and involvement,\u201d Cheng says. \u201cAnd I find it incredibly difficult to be in the same courtroom. I can\u2019t look them in the face or in the eye. \u201cPeople say \u2018Oh, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve forgiven them for what has happened.\u2019 And I say, \u2018No \u2026 it\u2019s a lot more than that.\u2019 To say I don\u2019t have any negative emotions is quite false.\u201d In November, another plotter, Milad Atai, took back an apology he had made to the family. He declared remorse to be \u201cbullshit\u201d, shortly before he was sentenced to 38 years in jail. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to speak and write in a way that has a responsibility,\u201d Cheng says. \u201cTo separate out some of the personal grief and trauma. It would have been easy, but I guess I didn\u2019t take the easy way out.\u201d The two men don\u2019t spell it out but they have realised they took more care with their words when they wrote Curtis\u2019s eulogy than elected officials do on the floor of parliament. \u201cIn the very early stage, within a week or two of when Dad died, Qais and other friends of mine were just sitting in a room, writing,\u201d says Cheng. \u201cKnowing that words that I have to say, matter. \u201cA lot of people say \u2018I can\u2019t do what you do.\u2019 That\u2019s where I get that sense that it would be so easy, because it seems like everyone says that\u2019s what they would do.\u201d Mohammed now lives with his wife in London, and works in finance. Cheng, a teacher, lives in Canberra. He travels back to Sydney sometimes to have meetings and speak at community events. He also occasionally writes opinion pieces, after thinking about what to say because, if people are going to be listening, it matters to him that he gets it right.",

      "bodyText": "Six former soldiers seeking asylum in Australia, who failed to return to Afghanistan after the Invictus Games, have been offered life-changing prosthetic surgery for limbs lost during the long-running war against the Taliban. The group, which includes five former Afghan National Army (ANA) soldiers and one trainer, are in Australia on bridging visas and awaiting the outcome of their refugee claims. They all lost a limb \u2013 in some cases two \u2013 while serving with the ANA alongside the US-led coalition forces, which included Australia. Saif Rahmani was on a mission with US special forces in 2013 when they were ambushed by the Taliban, he told Guardian Australia.

It is now long overdue for the world to stand up.</p> <p>While Kovrig and Spavor have been granted consular access, it is reportedly limited to one visit a month. Consular access, like access to a lawyer, is a procedural safeguard against abuse in custody. In China, where abuse in custody, especially in the first few weeks of detention, is well documented, the importance of consular or legal access cannot be over emphasised. There are reports Kovrig is being denied access to a lawyer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/12/china-canada-diplomat-michael-kovrig-detention-latest-\">China detains second Canadian citizen as Huawei row intensifies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>China routinely denies such fundamental rights through its system for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/03/us-china-travel-advisory-restrictions\">arbitrary and secret detention.</a></p> <p>This includes residential surveillance at a designated location (RSDL), an abusive provision within China\u2019s 2012 Criminal Procedure Law, and the system under which China is likely to hold Kovrig and Spavor.</p> <p>They are being held at undisclosed locations, typical of RSDL, and based on past cases we know these are not ad hoc \u201cblack jails\u201d but custom built or repurposed facilities institutionalised under the Criminal Procedure Law and relevant guidelines.</p> <p>The law gives rise to RSDL for such crimes as endangering national security. Although it holds that family members shall be notified within 24 hours and access to a lawyer should be granted within 48 hours, national security exemptions allow for these rights to be denied. The police may even refuse the prosecutor access to determine the legality of the detention or whether the individual is being ill-treated.</p> <p>A statutory basis does not make something permissible under international law where it violates fundamental human rights.</p> <p>With RSDL and similar mechanisms, the intent is clear: a detention system for vaguely worded national security crimes for which all procedural safeguards can be revoked on national security grounds. In China, the denial of rights is not the exception, but the rule. This is why RSDL and similar procedures are so dangerous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b797982944aea1c04f39fcc6c9d1cd3290dd0e93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b797982944aea1c04f39fcc6c9d1cd3290dd0e93/0_186_2500_1501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Canadian Michael Spavor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Canadian Michael Spavor is one of the latest victim of China\u2019s system of arbitrary detention.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Physical and mental torture is common, as shown in the <a href=\"http://rsdlmonitor.com/meet-the-people-in-the-peoples-republic-of-the-disappeared/\">testimonies in my book</a>, The People\u2019s Republic of the Disappeared, and the database of more than 100 RSDL cases maintained by Safeguard Defenders. Measures include sleep deprivation, forced malnourishment or forced medication, being subjected to stress positions, beatings, and threats to one\u2019s friends and family. Televised forced confessions are increasingly common. Kovrig or Spavor may be pressured to deliver a forced confession as a precondition of their release.</p> <p>Conditions are less severe for foreigners than for Chinese citizens, but they are never free from abuse. Sadly, reports indicate Kovrig is being interrogated morning, noon, and night, and subjected to sleep deprivation.</p> <p>Because of such abuse, the United Nations committee against torture, as early as 2016, called on China, as a matter of urgency, to repeal domestic provisions allowing for RSDL and other forms of secret detention.</p> <p>Earlier this year, human rights groups Safeguard Defenders, the International Service for Human Rights, Network for Chinese Human Rights Defenders, and Rights Practice sent a submission on RSDL to the UN. In their response, experts from the Human Rights Council noted that RSDL exposes its victims to torture and that exceptions in the law make it tantamount to an enforced disappearance, grave crimes under international law.</p> <p>Despite this \u2013 and although China has detained hundreds of Chinese human rights defenders and numerous foreign nationals under this and similar provisions, not to mention the arbitrary imprisonment or disappearance of some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/31/uk-believes-china-has-interned-about-1-million-uighur-muslims\">one million Uyghurs and Kazakhs across Xinjiang</a> \u2013 it has generated shockingly limited international blowback.</p> <p>In each case where China has not been held accountable, it virtually guarantees the next.</p> <p>Any country that systematically denies the rights of its own citizens, and flouts international norms, should worry us all because such abuses, as we are increasingly seeing, don\u2019t stop at the colour of one\u2019s passport.</p> <p>That China has now arbitrarily detained several Canadian citizens in thuggish pursuit of Communist party interests should clearly be denounced, and their immediate release demanded, but it should surprise no one considering China has institutionalised just this type of abusive behaviour with effectively no international repercussions. It is time for change.</p> <ul> <li><p>Michael Caster is a human rights advocate and researcher, author of The People\u2019s Republic of the Disappeared, and co-founder of the human rights organisation Safeguard Defenders.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Canada\u2019s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, has called China\u2019s detention of Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor a \u201cworrying precedent\u201d but for many China watchers it is all too familiar. It reminds us of the detentions of other foreign citizens, such as Canadian Kevin Garratt, Briton Peter Humphrey, Sweden\u2019s Gui Minhai, or Taiwanese Lee Ming-che, and that over the years China has institutionalised arbitrary and secret detention affecting innumerable Chinese citizens, and with little international consequence. China feels emboldened to place literally anyone under arbitrary and secret detention, regardless of citizenship. It is now long overdue for the world to stand up. While Kovrig and Spavor have been granted consular access, it is reportedly limited to one visit a month. Consular access, like access to a lawyer, is a procedural safeguard against abuse in custody. In China, where abuse in custody, especially in the first few weeks of detention, is well documented, the importance of consular or legal access cannot be over emphasised. There are reports Kovrig is being denied access to a lawyer. China routinely denies such fundamental rights through its system for arbitrary and secret detention. This includes residential surveillance at a designated location (RSDL), an abusive provision within China\u2019s 2012 Criminal Procedure Law, and the system under which China is likely to hold Kovrig and Spavor. They are being held at undisclosed locations, typical of RSDL, and based on past cases we know these are not ad hoc \u201cblack jails\u201d but custom built or repurposed facilities institutionalised under the Criminal Procedure Law and relevant guidelines. The law gives rise to RSDL for such crimes as endangering national security. Although it holds that family members shall be notified within 24 hours and access to a lawyer should be granted within 48 hours, national security exemptions allow for these rights to be denied. The police may even refuse the prosecutor access to determine the legality of the detention or whether the individual is being ill-treated. A statutory basis does not make something permissible under international law where it violates fundamental human rights. With RSDL and similar mechanisms, the intent is clear: a detention system for vaguely worded national security crimes for which all procedural safeguards can be revoked on national security grounds. In China, the denial of rights is not the exception, but the rule. This is why RSDL and similar procedures are so dangerous. Physical and mental torture is common, as shown in the testimonies in my book, The People\u2019s Republic of the Disappeared, and the database of more than 100 RSDL cases maintained by Safeguard Defenders. Measures include sleep deprivation, forced malnourishment or forced medication, being subjected to stress positions, beatings, and threats to one\u2019s friends and family. Televised forced confessions are increasingly common. Kovrig or Spavor may be pressured to deliver a forced confession as a precondition of their release. Conditions are less severe for foreigners than for Chinese citizens, but they are never free from abuse. Sadly, reports indicate Kovrig is being interrogated morning, noon, and night, and subjected to sleep deprivation. Because of such abuse, the United Nations committee against torture, as early as 2016, called on China, as a matter of urgency, to repeal domestic provisions allowing for RSDL and other forms of secret detention. Earlier this year, human rights groups Safeguard Defenders, the International Service for Human Rights, Network for Chinese Human Rights Defenders, and Rights Practice sent a submission on RSDL to the UN. In their response, experts from the Human Rights Council noted that RSDL exposes its victims to torture and that exceptions in the law make it tantamount to an enforced disappearance, grave crimes under international law. Despite this \u2013 and although China has detained hundreds of Chinese human rights defenders and numerous foreign nationals under this and similar provisions, not to mention the arbitrary imprisonment or disappearance of some one million Uyghurs and Kazakhs across Xinjiang \u2013 it has generated shockingly limited international blowback. In each case where China has not been held accountable, it virtually guarantees the next. Any country that systematically denies the rights of its own citizens, and flouts international norms, should worry us all because such abuses, as we are increasingly seeing, don\u2019t stop at the colour of one\u2019s passport. That China has now arbitrarily detained several Canadian citizens in thuggish pursuit of Communist party interests should clearly be denounced, and their immediate release demanded, but it should surprise no one considering China has institutionalised just this type of abusive behaviour with effectively no international repercussions. It is time for change.

On Same Town, New Story, from El Pintor, Banks sings that it \u201cFeels like the whole world\u2019s coming down on me / Wide eyed, venture so slowly.\u201d In a 2014 interview, the band was asked about their relationship to New York in the 21st century, with its glassy condominiums and cookie-cutter architecture. Drummer Sam Fogarino said that although the city had changed dramatically, \u201cthere\u2019s still something about New York. As soon you step on the sidewalk, you\u2019re fucking in New York. It\u2019s still pure. Everywhere you look, everywhere you walk \u2026 It\u2019s still the best fucking city in the world, no matter what phase it\u2019s going through.\u201d Even at a vast distance, covered in a mask of sea-spray, Interpol allow me to inhabit the world of old New York, as if I was behind the camera with David Wojnarowicz in the late 1970s, or shooting hoops with Jim Carroll on the Lower East Side. Listening to their cinematic hooks, I become an anonymous figure in a great dark metropolis. \u2022 Interpol are playing in Melbourne on Friday 4 January at Sydney on Saturday 5 January",

Three months later I was a shell of myself, unreachable. People began avoiding me at work, unsure of what to say or do. By six months I was a pool of tears. A colleague raised their voice at me and I spent the next week hiding in my house, crying.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/19/recovery-addiction-bereavement-mental-illness-cancer-debt\">How I recovered, by the people who did | Julie Powell and others</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At nine months I was panic and fear. Every hour I ran around the block of my office or my house \u2013 trying to outrun the terror.</p> <p>At twelve months I was simply relieved to have survived twelve months.</p> <p>Now, at two years, I\u2019m nothing if not changeable. Some days I\u2019m joy on wheels, walking my dogs in the bush or sharing a drink with friends. Some days I burst into tears because my mother would have liked the way I pruned her favourite pot plant just so. Happy or sad, there isn\u2019t a moment in my life that I don\u2019t experience through the prism of her death.</p> <p>Grief is not one thing. Grief does not fit into three days of leave, or neatly around a nine-to-five work schedule. And yet we continue to pretend that it should.</p> <p>According to research, there are around 160,000 deaths in Australia each year. Each death leaves one to five close ties behind. What this research suggests is that, at any point in time, large numbers of our community \u2013 workplaces or otherwise \u2013 are grieving.</p> <p>We may be uncomfortable in the face of this grief, and unsure of what to do. But when we leave those who are grieving alone, we intensify their loneliness which can lead to depression, and other mental health issues, ultimately weakening their immune system.</p> <p>Grief raises the risk of heart disease, cancer and high blood pressure. With grief\u2019s link to depression, one current theory is that it may in fact stop the process of neurogenesis \u2013 the ability of our brains to create new neurons. In other words, while we are grieving our brains may be unable to learn and adapt to new information, experiences or situations. Working through grief is like walking through molasses. Hardly the flexible, agile and adaptive employees our workplace strategic plans demand.</p> <p>In modern life we no longer make space for grief. We are uncomfortable bearing witness. As Cheryl Strayed wrote in her book Brave Enough, we do not help the bereaved when their suffering goes on beyond what we are comfortable with or feel is appropriate. We don\u2019t help them, we tell them they need to get help, \u201cwe pathologize their pain; we call suffering a disease\u201d. And in doing so, we make it harder for people to understand their own grief, let alone the grief of others.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/23/christmas-father-death-grief-pavlova-mother\">The first Christmas after my father\u2019s death, I took my grief out on a pavlova | Jean Hannah Edelstein</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After the loss of her sister, Kate Beaton said \u201cgrief opens the doors to other parts of your life and mind, making lateral moves into unrelated spaces and opening fire there\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The enterprise bargaining agreement at my workplace permits three days of leave for the loss of a loved one. I\u2019m not sure how three days of leave are supposed to work for the bereaved. On day one you are numb. Day two you cry. And on day three, you step towards life. Ready to be back at your desk by day four? Able to have friendly Monday morning chats? Contribute to the next strategic planning meeting? Grief cannot be neatly packaged into three days. Grief wears many faces, it keeps odd hours. My mother died a hard death from aggressive breast cancer in February 2017. After three days the funeral wasn\u2019t even organised. At one month I was numb, trying to carry on each day as I had done before she died \u2013 back at my desk, as the enterprise bargaining agreement told me I should be. Three months later I was a shell of myself, unreachable. People began avoiding me at work, unsure of what to say or do. By six months I was a pool of tears. A colleague raised their voice at me and I spent the next week hiding in my house, crying. At nine months I was panic and fear. Every hour I ran around the block of my office or my house \u2013 trying to outrun the terror. At twelve months I was simply relieved to have survived twelve months. Now, at two years, I\u2019m nothing if not changeable. Some days I\u2019m joy on wheels, walking my dogs in the bush or sharing a drink with friends. Some days I burst into tears because my mother would have liked the way I pruned her favourite pot plant just so. Happy or sad, there isn\u2019t a moment in my life that I don\u2019t experience through the prism of her death. Grief is not one thing. Grief does not fit into three days of leave, or neatly around a nine-to-five work schedule. And yet we continue to pretend that it should. According to research, there are around 160,000 deaths in Australia each year. Each death leaves one to five close ties behind. What this research suggests is that, at any point in time, large numbers of our community \u2013 workplaces or otherwise \u2013 are grieving. We may be uncomfortable in the face of this grief, and unsure of what to do. But when we leave those who are grieving alone, we intensify their loneliness which can lead to depression, and other mental health issues, ultimately weakening their immune system. Grief raises the risk of heart disease, cancer and high blood pressure. With grief\u2019s link to depression, one current theory is that it may in fact stop the process of neurogenesis \u2013 the ability of our brains to create new neurons. In other words, while we are grieving our brains may be unable to learn and adapt to new information, experiences or situations. Working through grief is like walking through molasses. Hardly the flexible, agile and adaptive employees our workplace strategic plans demand. In modern life we no longer make space for grief. We are uncomfortable bearing witness. As Cheryl Strayed wrote in her book Brave Enough, we do not help the bereaved when their suffering goes on beyond what we are comfortable with or feel is appropriate. We don\u2019t help them, we tell them they need to get help, \u201cwe pathologize their pain; we call suffering a disease\u201d. And in doing so, we make it harder for people to understand their own grief, let alone the grief of others. After the loss of her sister, Kate Beaton said \u201cgrief opens the doors to other parts of your life and mind, making lateral moves into unrelated spaces and opening fire there\u201d. Grief upends your life, reshapes who you are, where you thought you were going and leaves all the plans you had for getting there on the scrap heap. As the two-year anniversary of my mother\u2019s death looms, I think about her often. I try very literally to move in the direction of life, talking with my partner about our new puppy, about starting a family. I never imagined my mother wouldn\u2019t be part of these conversations, where we grapple with how to fit another life event around our work schedules. Who will help us in the first few months of sleeplessness when our baby arrives? Tell us what do we do when the baby cries? Every step I take towards new life, I feel her absence at my side. \u2022 Gemma Carey is a researcher at the University of New South Wales.

Community leaders said the report was irresponsible, misrepresented the community and was an incitement to violence. The segment \u2013 headlined online as \u201cThe \u2018race war\u2019 brewing on Melbourne\u2019s streets\u201d \u2013 did not interview any Sudanese-Australians, nor any Vietnamese-Australians who were willing to be named. But it did interview Neil Erikson, a far-right criminal who has convictions for racial vilification and stalking, and local grandmother Linda Boyd, who said she was afraid to go out at night. In a confrontational interview with Erikson, reporter Reid Butler described him as \u201c100% racist\u201d, but the program did not disclose any of Erikson\u2019s convictions. The \u201crace war\u201d quote came from Boyd, and not from any representatives of the two communities. Kevin Tran, a Victorian vice-president of the Vietnamese Community in Australia (VCA), said African-Australians were being unfairly treated by the media in the same way Vietnamese communities were 20 years ago.

The segment, broadcast on New Year\u2019s Eve, focused on violence in the western Melbourne suburb of St Albans and rising \u201cracial tensions\u201d. Footage obtained by the program showed two men \u2013 identified by the reporter as Sudanese-Australian \u2013 throwing chairs at a man at a cafe on Alfrieda Street. Butler then interviewed a man whose face was completely hidden in darkness, who claimed to be a Vietnamese-Australian, calling on people to \u201cmass protest\u201d crime by African-Australians. Vietnamese people \u201cmay band together and hurt any African youths in their way\u201d, he said. But the VCA said the incident on Alfrieda Street was not \u201crace-related\u201d and the report was incorrect. \u201cThese incidents are not race-related and members of the Vietnamese community have not been singled out,\u201d the group\u2019s Victorian president, Viv Nguyen, said.

      "body": "<h2>1) Blackpool v Arsenal</h2> <p>The story of the 1953 Charity Shield wasn\u2019t too dissimilar from the story of the 1953 FA Cup final. Stan Mortensen was on target for Blackpool, but his teammate Stanley Matthews ran off with the man-of-the-match plaudits. Yet the tale wasn\u2019t an exact facsimile: despite the heroic efforts of the two Stans, Cup winners Blackpool lost the Shield to league champions Arsenal.

But after scoring the winner at Wembley in May, Norwood has relished his role as Rovers\u2019 go-to man, scoring 18 since August, propelling his side to within touching distance of the play-offs. The worry for Tranmere now is losing Norwood, with the 28-year-old out of contract this summer. Norwood has the perfect opportunity to impress suitors higher up the ladder on Friday evening, with an audition against a likely experimental Spurs back line under the lights at Prenton Park. \u201cBig evenings like Tottenham will go a long way to seeing us keep moving forward,\u201d said manager Micky Mellon. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some dark times and hit rock bottom.\u201d <strong>BF</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3) Woking v Watford</h2> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see the fuss about it, we\u2019re going to turn up here, get absolutely smashed and I\u2019m going to go home and get on with my life again,\u201d said Alan Dowson, the Woking manager, in an interview last week. Maybe the magic of the Cup is lost on Dowson, or moreover perhaps it is just a touch of mind games, an attempt to relax his players before facing Premier League opposition. Woking, second in the National League South, are the lowest-ranked team left and warmed up for Javi Gracia\u2019s Watford with a 3-0 win over Hampton and Richmond on Tuesday. Greg Luer, the former Hull youngster, hit a hat-trick in that game, while Ben Gerring, an October arrival, captained Truro City to the first round last season.

They last advanced to the fourth round in 2009-10 and have since lost eight consecutive third-round ties. Anchored to the bottom of the Championship, 10 points from safety and with two wins to their name all season, there is little to suggest they will stop the rot against Accrington Stanley, who are just 12 places below Saturday\u2019s visitors in the league standings. While maintaining Ipswich\u2019s Championship status is manager Paul Lambert\u2019s priority, he told reporters at his pre-match press conference he would travel to Accrington \u201cas strong as I can\u201d. Even so, Stanley manager John Coleman is unlikely to be fazed but has conceded his own team haven\u2019t been playing too well either. \u201cWe are like Jekyll and Hyde at the moment, not in our performances but in our results, so this is an opportunity for us to get back on track,\u201d he said, before pointing out that funds generated by a 2003-04 Cup run helped get Stanley into the Football League. Advancing to the fourth round for only the third time since the collapse of the original Stanley in 1966 could land them a similarly lucrative jackpot. <strong>BG</strong></p> <h2>5) Everton v Lincoln City</h2> <p>How Lincoln City must have been rubbing their hands together at Everton\u2019s recent wobble.

At Lincoln, the mood could not be more contrasting. The 6ft 5in Yerry Mina, if he plays, will meet his match in Matt Rhead and John Akinde, a pair of burly strikers who will be determined to make life difficult. As well as Akinde, prolific since arriving from Barnet in the summer, Lincoln boast guile in the shape of Shay McCartan, the talented Northern Ireland forward. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to playing at Goodison Park against a massive club,\u201d McCartan said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting teams coming to us [in the league] and raising their games.

They\u2019ve won it six times apiece, a total only bettered in history by Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool and Aston Villa. Only problem is, all the good work was done an awfully long time ago. Newcastle lifted their sixth FA Cup in 1955, while Blackburn completed their collection in 1928, having won their other five in the 19th century. So No 7 is well overdue. More recent results \u2013 just three wins between them since the start of December \u2013 suggests the long wait is likely to go on, whoever prevails. But history can be a blessing as well as a burden: Newcastle beat Blackburn on their way to the 1910 and 1952 FA Cups, while Rovers saw off the Toon during their one successful 20th-century run. The winners are therefore permitted to brazenly ignore the current form-book and take a firm clutch of the good old Comforting Straws Of Precedence. They feel real nice, don\u2019t they. <strong>SM</strong></p> <h2>7) Newport County v Leicester City</h2> <p>Newport County saw off Welsh rivals Wrexham in emphatic style to earn themselves a plum home tie and the welcome windfall that comes with it being shown live on the BBC.<strong> </strong>In last season\u2019s fourth round, Tottenham\u2019s players clearly didn\u2019t fancy the conditions on a cold January night at Rodney Parade and were extremely lucky to escape with a draw before winning the replay in the more familiar surroundings of Wembley.

      "bodyText": "Game on. At a frantic, slightly wild Etihad Stadium Manchester City defibrillated their own hopes of retaining the title with a 2-1 defeat of Liverpool that was by turns fearful, fretful and often funny. That they did so owed much to their fighting spirit, a little more to good fortune and even more to Sergio Ag\u00fcero, the blue-grey rinse at the front of this team who played for 45 minutes like the only City player not afraid of the moment, still cold and cool in the middle of all that fury \u2013 of which there was quite a lot. No doubt there will be some talk now of City learning to win ugly. Incorrectly so. City did not win ugly here. They won very ugly. They also won slapstick, won zany and won thanks to something close to a pastiche of backs-to-the wall defending, coming on towards the end like a team of senior nuclear particle physicists caught up in an increasingly convincing bare-knuckle street brawl. Finally one could almost hear the voices from the fringes muttering, as City\u2019s ball-players experimented with the idea of shanking wild-eyed clearances into the crowd, as they punted the poor old beleaguered ball forward, as the back four lined up to head clear of their own six-yard box like a \u00a3900m Tony Pulis tribute project, and as Bernardo Silva, a man born to glide and twirl and address the ball with his own feather-quilled left foot, careered about the place like a city-centre nightclub bouncer on New Year\u2019s Eve. Finally they have worked out how to play some proper football. And yet for all the energy this was also a victory born out of precision and out of a moment of stillness from City\u2019s most understated leader. The images of victory will be rooted elsewhere. Vincent Kompany was at times a cartoon of chest-heaving full-body defence, although he might also have been sent off for an excessively forceful lunge through Mohamed Salah.

According to Department for Work and Pensions data examined by the Labour party, single females with at least one dependent child make up over 85% of all householders who have had their benefits capped. Records show that 134,044 households have had support capped by the government, with single mothers accounting for 114,337 of those. They appear to show a significant jump from August last year, when nearly 50,000 single parents were reportedly facing a drop in benefits due to the cap. The benefit cap, which limits the total amount households can receive in benefits to \u00a320,000 a year, or \u00a323,000 in Greater London, was envisaged as an \u201cincentive\u201d to persuade unemployed people to move into work. Critics claim it is forcing many people into poverty and resulted in social cleansing because rents in inner-city areas are so high. Labour claims the statistics show ministers are failing to assess the impact of their policies upon vulnerable children. The shadow work and pensions secretary, Margaret Greenwood, said single mothers were being pushed into poverty by the cap. \u201cThe Conservatives have pushed ahead with their austerity agenda with scant regard for the impact on low-income families,\u201d she said. \u201cLabour will build a social security system that is there for any of us in our time of need.\u201d The latest figures were released on the DWP\u2019s Stat-Xplore site in November and include statistics showing the number of men and women whose benefits were capped up to August of last year. The latest figures also show that 120,297 single claimant women had their benefits capped, compared with just 13,743 single claimant men over the same period. The vast majority of those women had dependent children. The latest disclosure follows other recent studies which found that the cap was leaving more people in debt and pushing poor children further into poverty. A study of more than 10,000 benefit-capped households by the Policy in Practice consultancy found that for every child whose parents moved back into work as a result of the cap, eight more would grow up in families whose financial circumstances worsened following the introduction of the policy. More than half of the households affected by the benefit cap were left stuck on it for six months or more. The average gap between rent and housing benefit for families stuck on the cap was \u00a33,750 a year. Pioneered by the former chancellor George Osborne, the cap limited total benefits to \u00a326,000 per year at its introduction in 2013.

Dubbed \u201cFat Cat Friday\u201d, 4 January is the date by which the average CEO of a FTSE 100 company pockets the equivalent take-home pay of a typical full-time worker in the UK. Calculations by the High Pay Centre thinktank and the professional HR body the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) show top executives are earning 133 times more than the average worker, at a rate of around \u00a31,020 per hour or \u00a33.9m annually. That\u2019s up 11% compared to a year earlier. It means CEOs working average 12-hour days would only have to clock in for 29 hours in 2019 to earn the median \u00a329,574 of British staff. The figures have prompted criticism from both unions and shareholder groups. The GMB\u2019s general secretary, Tim Roache, said: \u201cIt\u2019s sickening. Three days into the year and fat cat bosses have already made what average workers will earn all year. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair, and it makes no sense in how we value people\u2019s contribution to society and it makes no sense for the economy \u2013 I don\u2019t know any care workers who squirrel their wages away in offshore accounts, they spend it in their local areas and on paying their bills.\u201d Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, also slammed \u201cgreedy executives\u201d she said were \u201ctaking more than they\u2019ve earned\u201d. \u201cToo much wealth is being hoarded at the top,\u201d she said, adding that reforms were needed to bring executive pay \u201cback down to earth\u201d. Shareholders have also taken aim at overpaid executives, with 63 companies including Royal Mail, Persimmon and Unilever facing investor rebellions over pay last year. \u201cThis is a result of shareholders feeling they are not being listened to,\u201d said Andrew Ninian, the Investment Association\u2019s director of stewardship and corporate governance. \u201cCompanies need to do more to respond to shareholder concerns and ensure pay rewards align with company performance and remain at levels that are justifiable to shareholders.\u201d A \u00a375m bonus pocketed by the boss of Persimmon, Jeff Fairburn, eventually resulted in his ousting in November following an earlier investor backlash. Last summer Royal Mail suffered one of the biggest shareholder revolts in UK corporate history when around 70% voted against its pay package for its CEO, Rico Back, worth up to \u00a32.7m. This was on top of a \u00a36m \u201cgolden hello\u201d for him having left the company\u2019s European subsidiary. The CIPD and the High Pay Centre are calling for a major overhaul of how executive pay is set in the UK. The two bodies say corporate remuneration committees, which decide executive pay levels within each company, should be more diverse in terms of gender, ethnicity and professional background in order to combat group-think. They are also calling for long-term incentive plans, which tend to dole out performance-based bonuses every three years, to be replaced with a less complex system based on a basic salary and a small restricted share award. Executive performance should also be based on benchmarks including employee wellbeing and workforce training, which the High Pay Centre and CIPD say are \u201ccrucial for good corporate governance\u201d. CIPD\u2019s chief executive, Peter Cheese, said: \u201cExcessive pay packages awarded by remuneration committees represent a significant failure in corporate governance and perpetuate the idea of a \u2018superstar\u2019 business leader when business is a collective endeavour and reward should be shared more fairly. \u201cThis imbalance does nothing to help heal the many social and economic divides facing the country.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Girls\u2019 much-higher rate of depression than boys is closely linked to the greater time they spend on social media, and online bullying and poor sleep are the main culprits for their low mood, new research reveals. As many as three-quarters of 14-year-old girls who suffer from depression also have low self-esteem, are unhappy with how they look and sleep for seven hours or less each night, the study found. \u201cGirls, it seems, are struggling with these aspects of their lives more than boys, in some cases considerably so,\u201d said Prof Yvonne Kelly, from University College London, who led the team behind the findings. The results prompted renewed concern about the rapidly accumulating evidence that many more girls and young women exhibit a range of mental health problems than boys and young men, and about the damage these can cause, including self-harm and suicidal thoughts. The study is based on interviews with almost 11,000 14-year-olds who are taking part in the Millennium Cohort Study, a major research project into children\u2019s lives. It found that many girls spend far more time using social media than boys, and also that they are much more likely to display signs of depression linked to their interaction on platforms such as Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook. It found that two in five girls are on social media at least three hours a day compared to a fifth of their male peers. While one in 10 boys do not use social media at all, only 4% of girls said the same. \u201cThe link between social media use and depressive symptoms was stronger for girls compared with boys. For girls, greater daily hours of social media use corresponded to a stepwise increase in depressive symptoms,\u201d explained Kelly. For example, while 7.5% of 14-year-old girls and 4.3% of 14-year-old boys have been the victim of online harassment, 35.6% of girls who are depressed have experienced that \u2013 double the 17.4% of boys who have done so.
