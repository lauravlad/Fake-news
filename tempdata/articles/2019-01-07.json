      "bodyText": "The far-right protests that erupted in Melbourne over the weekend which included neo-Nazis, should prompt us to be vigilant about those who seek to divide their fellow Australians on racial lines. So editorialised the Australian on Monday in the wake of news that Queensland senator Fraser Anning had attended a far-right rally at Melbourne\u2019s St Kilda Beach on the weekend. The Australian\u2019s unequivocal denunciation of those who seek to foment anger and intolerance based on race was refreshing. But also a little surprising. Had the editorial writer been reading any News Corp publications during 2018? Had they missed the year-long campaign to demonise the African community in Melbourne as a hotbed of gang activity? The same newspaper only last week editorialised \u201cunfortunately, the Andrews government and senior police have equivocated at times about African gangs, as if the greater danger were an outbreak of mass racism among ordinary Victorians\u201d. Anning cited the rise of \u201cAfrican gangs\u201d in his home state as the reason why he spent $3,000 of taxpayers\u2019 money to attend the rally at the invitation of Blair Cottrell, a notorious far-right convener of the United Patriots Front. But who helped highlight this \u201cracial problem?\u201d Outgoing racial discrimination commissioner Tim Soutphommasane warned that focusing on race without looking at factors such as social disadvantage, or indeed the real facts about crime, posed an \u201curgent risk to racial harmony in Australia\u201d. It is absolutely right for media to report on violent incidents in any city. Public safety is a legitimate concern. But it is absolutely wrong to dwell on the ethnicity of the offender unless it is germane to the story. The reason is simple. It plays to the worst aspects of human nature \u2013 fear and prejudice \u2013 damaging entire communities, whether that is the intention or not. News Corp publications, notably the Herald Sun and the Australian, have given oxygen to the \u201cAfrican gangs\u201d phenomenon throughout 2018, despite the concerted efforts of the Victorian police to douse the comparisons with US-style gangs. Take this front-page headline in the Herald Sun on 9 September: \u201cHigh rise chaos: police hunt violent African youths following tower mayhem.\u201d Or this: \u201cCarjack gang busted: AK 47 seized. 14 African, Middle Eastern and Asian youths arrested.\u201d Columnist Andrew Bolt spent 2018 highlighting incidents involving people of African background in his blog. There was no mention of crimes by drunken Aussies or visiting backpackers. Instead he recited a litany of incidents involving people of African appearance, who may or may not have been born overseas. On 12 July he offered this: We can\u2019t pretend \u2013 as police once did \u2013 that there is not a very big crime problem in this specific group. In fact, police statistics last year showed the Sudanese-born, for instance, are an astonishing 128 times more likely than other Victorians to commit violent robberies and 68 times more likely to stage home invasions. What we don\u2019t describe will not get addressed. We can\u2019t pretend \u2013 as many politicians keep doing \u2013 that importing refugee groups from tribal war-torn Third World areas and from cultures very different to ours does not put Australians here in danger. It is just not fair to those who then become victims of crime. We need descriptors to help catch perpetrators. Bolt\u2019s highly selective figures, which he says are police figures from 2015, are alarming at first glance. But the Sudanese community is small \u2013 just 1.1% of the Victorian population and younger than the Victorian average, which means there are likely to be more interactions with police. Social justice advocate Nyadol Nyuon offered this defence of the Sudanese community on Radio National: \u201cThe overwhelming majority of crimes in Victoria are committed by Australian and New Zealand-born people ... South Sudanese do commit about 1% of the offences.\u201d The ABC and Guardian fact-checked her claim, using figures from Victoria\u2019s Crime Statistics Agency, and found that between April 2017 and March 2018, Australian and New Zealand-born offenders made up a combined 73.5% of the unique offender population (those people alleged to have committed crimes) in Victoria; whereas, those born in Sudan made up 1.1%. Despite the facts showing offenders are much more likely to be born in Australia, when the immigration minister Peter Dutton observed in January 2018 that people in Melbourne were \u201cscared to go out to restaurants\u201d because of African gang violence, Bolt and his fellow columnists leapt to his defence. News Corp columnists such as Rita Panahi have accused Victoria police of \u201cengaging in semantics\u201d when they have rejected the label \u201cAfrican gangs\u201d. The police commissioner, Graham Ashton, has been lampooned for trying to distinguish between gang activity and street level crime. He argued that while these offenders know each other and might come together through social media, they are not part of an organised structure which is the hallmark of bikie gangs or overseas gangs. The reason why he\u2019s made this point is not to downgrade the incidents, but to point out the solution might not lie in more vigorous police enforcement, but a much broader social response to bored and disenfranchised youth roaming the streets of outer Melbourne with little to do. Labelling these groups as gangs also runs the risk of making the lawlessness cool and can actually lead to more formal structures forming, say criminologists. But the more immediate fallout is for the largely law-abiding members of the particular community in the crosshairs, who have reported feeling fearful and being shunned in the street. And it gives licence to groups on the far right, who embrace the mainstream media narrative of a \u201cracial problem\u201d and then turn it into far more powerful hate speech, often directing their vitriol towards unrelated groups such as the Jewish community. As University of Adelaide media academic John Budarick observed: \u201cSuch media coverage is, sadly, something African-Australians have been exposed to before \u2013 it seems to have popped up regularly in some form over the past 10 years, at least. \u201cBefore this, it was the Lebanese who were said to be forming menacing gangs, and before them, the Vietnamese and the Italians. The Australian media have a poor record in dealing with difference and diversity.\u201d Perhaps the Australian\u2019s editorial represents a turning point in News Corp\u2019s coverage, a signal that 2019 will usher in a more nuanced approach to crime and ethnicity \u2013 and a deeper understanding of the responsibility that the media carries for informed reporting.

      "body": "<p>In October 1986 the bodies of two nine-year-old girls \u2013 best friends \u2013 were discovered in a wooded area above a park near the Moulsecoomb estate in Brighton. Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway had been sexually assaulted and strangled, and the case became known, in a crass bit of tabloid shorthand, as the \u201cbabes in the wood\u201d murders.</p> <p>The Babes in the Wood Murders: The Prosecutors (BBC Two) spent two years recording efforts by the police and prosecutors to reopen the case 30 years after the main suspect, Russell Bishop, was acquitted by a jury at Lewes crown court. His defence called into doubt the reliability of the forensic evidence, and he left jail vindicated in the eyes of the law; a free man, untouchable.</p> <p>Three decades on, two things have changed: DNA profiling has become routine, and changes to the law regarding double jeopardy in 2003 made it possible to retry someone found innocent. The verb \u201cquash\u201d, for so long used almost exclusively in conjunction with the noun \u201cconviction\u201d, gained new purpose. Under the right circumstances, it is now possible to quash an acquittal.</p> <p>Bishop has been in jail since 1990 for a similar attack \u2013 this time on a seven-year-old girl who survived and identified him.

      "bodyText": "In October 1986 the bodies of two nine-year-old girls \u2013 best friends \u2013 were discovered in a wooded area above a park near the Moulsecoomb estate in Brighton. Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway had been sexually assaulted and strangled, and the case became known, in a crass bit of tabloid shorthand, as the \u201cbabes in the wood\u201d murders. The Babes in the Wood Murders: The Prosecutors (BBC Two) spent two years recording efforts by the police and prosecutors to reopen the case 30 years after the main suspect, Russell Bishop, was acquitted by a jury at Lewes crown court. His defence called into doubt the reliability of the forensic evidence, and he left jail vindicated in the eyes of the law; a free man, untouchable. Three decades on, two things have changed: DNA profiling has become routine, and changes to the law regarding double jeopardy in 2003 made it possible to retry someone found innocent. The verb \u201cquash\u201d, for so long used almost exclusively in conjunction with the noun \u201cconviction\u201d, gained new purpose. Under the right circumstances, it is now possible to quash an acquittal. Bishop has been in jail since 1990 for a similar attack \u2013 this time on a seven-year-old girl who survived and identified him. New rules allowed for this kind of \u201cbad character\u201d evidence to be used in the appeal, but success was far from assured. \u201cThis has got to be the oldest case that will thus far have been brought back to the court of appeal under this legislation,\u201d said Brian Altman QC, the prosecuting barrister. \u201cSo that\u2019s against us to begin with.\u201d Bishop was rearrested and interviewed. He tried to \u201cno comment\u201d his way through the questions, but it was clear he lacked the self-discipline to keep it up. He overrode his lawyer\u2019s objections and became agitated when pressed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got my answer,\u201d he said at one point. \u201cWrite the fucker down and move on.\u201d Like the two series about the Crown Prosecution Service that went before it, this standalone Prosecutors documentary focused on the sometimes grisly, sometimes tedious work that goes into taking a case to court, but here special attention was reserved for the families of the victims, whose lives were for ever altered by a crime that took place 32 years ago.

      "bodyText": "President Donald Trump will address the nation on Tuesday night about the border in the midst of the ongoing government shutdown Trump will also visit the border on Thursday, the White House announced. The administration announced today that it will still pay tax refunds despite the fact that there is no money appropriated to keep the IRS and the Treasury Department open Former vice president Joe Biden is drawing closer to making a decision about a presidential bid. NBC is reporting that only six people in the federal terrorism database were stopped at the southern border in the first half of 2018. This contradicts a statement from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders that over 4,000 suspected terrorists were stopped at the border. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney is reportedly interested in leaving the administration to become President of the University of South Carolina. The New York Times reports that the former South Carolina congressman has expressed interest in leading the university located in the state capital of Columbia. The federal judiciary has found additional funds to keep operations going for an additional week despite the partial shutdown. The federal courts will now be able to function through January 18. The Trump administration has announced that the IRS will continue to pay out tax refunds during the partial government shutdown. Past precedent would have prevented the IRS from doing this in advance of the April 15 deadline to submit federal tax returns. How are you affected by the government shutdown? Communities across the country are starting to feel the pain of the shutdown and many of the 800,000 federal workers furloughed, or forced to work without pay, have been collecting experiences under the hashtag #shutdownstories on social media. We would like to hear from you if you are affected. What has the impact has been on you, your family and community? Tell us here. We will feature a selection of your contributions in our reporting. Although it seems Trump\u2019s remarks will be on cable news, there is a big difference between that and broadcast networks which are still determining what to do as Maggie Haberman of the New York Times notes. Former President Jimmy Carter has become the last living president to weigh in and deny that he urged President Donald Trump to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump claimed last week that at least one former president told him that he regretted not building a wall. With Carter\u2019s statement, all four living former presidents have now denied telling Trump this. As Democrats make their final decision about mounting a presidential bid, it\u2019s worth noting that there are already over 400 announced candidates, including Donald Trump. The Washington Post reports: The FEC maintains a page listing every person who has filed form F-2 announcing their candidacies. As of writing, there are 447 such individuals, 32 of whom declared before 2016 was over and 63 of whom declared their 2020 candidacies before President Trump was even inaugurated. Brian Stelter at CNN reports that the networks are still deciding whether to grant Trump\u2019s request to address the nation in primetime. Donald Trump just tweeted that he will address the nation tomorrow night at 9pm EST. Iowa senator Chuck Grassley has some advice for Trump if he delivers a primetime address tomorrow. Politico reports that Trump has been turned down by two people whom he has asked to serve as his secretary of defense. Both retired general Jack Keane and former senator Jon Kyl of Arizona have reportedly told Trump that they are not interested in succeeding James Mattis in that role. Kyl just rejoined the law firm of Covington and Burling, where he previously served as a lobbyist before being appointed to fill the Senate seat vacated by John McCain\u2019s death. He resigned at the end of 2018 and was succeeded by Martha McSally, the losing Republican candidate for the other Senate seat in Arizona. Kyl previously had served three terms in the Senate from 1995-2013. The New York Times reports Trump wants to give a primetime address tomorrow about the shutdown and the border. The White House has requested time from the networks to interrupt primetime programming. Senate Democrats will attempt to block that chamber from voting on any legislation until Senate leader Mitch McConnell moves to allow votes on House-passed bills funding the government. If successful, this would not end the partial shutdown but force Trump to veto government funding legislation if he wants the showdown over the border wall to continue. Democrats set up a Facebook group to try to falsely link Senate candidate Roy Moore to prohibitionists during the 2017 special election in Alabama. The New York Times reports that the \u201cDry Alabama\u201d Facebook group was created by Democratic activists in order to falsely tar Moore with support for making Alabama a dry state. (Currently 25 of the state\u2019s 67 counties are at least partially dry with Clay County allowing liquor sales in two cities starting in 2016). As the Times describes the effort: In a political bank shot made in the last two weeks of the campaign, they thought associating Mr. Moore with calls for a statewide alcohol ban would hurt him with moderate, business-oriented Republicans and assist the Democrat, Doug Jones, who won the special election by a hair-thin margin. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders announced that Donald Trump will go to the U.S-Mexico border on Thursday. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio will decide whether to pursue a presidential bid in the next two months. His wife, Connie Schultz, told CNN that the rust belt progressive would make his decision soon. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to know within the next two months. I mean, we have to,\u201d she said. Brown was just re-elected to his third term in the Senate in November. The New York Times reports that Joe Biden is in the final stages of making a decision of whether to pursue a presidential bid in 2020. The former vice-president, who ran for the White House in 1988 and 2008, passed up a presidential bid in 2016. The septuagenarian spent 36 years representing Delaware in the Senate before being elected vice-president as Barack Obama\u2019s running mate in 2008. In one of his calls over the holidays, Mr. Biden repeated a variation of a line he has used publicly: \u201cIf you can persuade me there is somebody better who can win, I\u2019m happy not to do it,\u201d he said, according to the Democrat he spoke to, who shared the conversation on condition of anonymity to discuss a private talk. But then Mr. Biden said something he has not stated so bluntly in public: \u201cBut I don\u2019t see the candidate who can clearly do what has to be done to win.\u201d Elizabeth Warren just finished her first campaign swing through Iowa, making several stops in the central and western parts of the state. The Massachusetts Democrats attracted large crowds on her trip, which came days after she announced she was exploring a presidential bid on New Year\u2019s Eve. Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign is already taking steps to avoid any dissent on the floor of the 2020 convention in Charlotte. Politico reports: The president\u2019s reelection campaign is intent on avoiding the kind of circus that unfolded on the convention floor in 2016, when Never Trump Republicans loudly protested his nomination before a national TV audience. The effort comes as party elites like Utah senator Mitt Romney are openly questioning Trump\u2019s fitness for the job, and it\u2019s meant to to ensure that delegates to next year\u2019s convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, are presidential loyalists \u2013 not anti-Trump activists looking to create a stir. Only weeks after cancer surgery, the supreme court has announced that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will not participate in oral arguments today. It will be the first time she has missed a sitting of the court since her confirmation in 1993. Former congressman John Delaney has bulked up his presidential campaign in Iowa. The Des Moines Register now reports he has 24 staffers in the Hawkeye State alone, including veterans of Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign and Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign. USA Today has a helpful explainer on Trump\u2019s suggestion that he can declare a national emergency in order to build the wall. The 1976 National Emergencies Act was passed in the post-Watergate, post-Vietnam era to create more structured procedures for the president\u2019s use of emergency powers. Under that law, the president must cite the specific emergency powers he is activating under existing statutes. According to the Congressional Research Service, there are hundreds of \u201cprovisions of federal law delegating to the executive extraordinary authority in time of national emergency\u201d. \u201cUnder the powers delegated by such statutes, the president may seize property, organize and control the means of production, seize commodities, assign military forces abroad, institute martial law, seize and control all transportation and communication, regulate the operation of private enterprise, restrict travel and, in a variety of ways, control the lives of United States citizens,\u201d says a 2007 CRS report. The most recent precedent for something like this was when Harry Truman took control of the steel industry during a national strike in 1952 in the midst of the Korean war. This was ruled unconstitutional in Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Company v Sawyer. The shutdown is starting to create economic fallout nationally. The Washington Post reports that it is starting to having a severe impact in towns and cities across the US. Many of the affected federal workers \u2013 including 10,000 people in Utah, 6,200 in West Virginia and 5,500 in Alabama \u2013 have salaries far below the average $85,000 for government employees. But those paychecks drive local economies, and workers are starting to make tough choices about how to spend them \u2013 eating out less, limiting travel and shopping at food pantries instead of grocery stores \u2013 creating a ripple effect through the neighborhoods and towns where they live. The Trump administration\u2019s latest offer in the ongoing partial shutdown is $5.7bn for a \u201csteel barrier\u201d accompanied by $800m to \u201caddress urgent humanitarian needs\u201d. It represents a shift from concrete to steel in the building material for the border wall. As Trump told reporters yesterday: \u201cI informed my folks to say that we\u2019ll build a steel barrier. Steel. It\u2019ll be made out of steel. It\u2019ll be less obtrusive, and it\u2019ll be stronger. But it\u2019ll be less obtrusive, stronger, and we\u2019re able to use our great companies to make it, by using steel ... They don\u2019t like concrete, so we\u2019ll give them steel. Steel is fine. Steel is actually \u2013 steel is actually more expensive than concrete, but it will look beautiful and it\u2019s very strong. It\u2019s actually stronger.\u201d It\u2019s day 17 of the partial government shutdown, Donald Trump is tweeting about \u201cFake News\u201d and Elizabeth Warren just finished her first campaign swing in Iowa. It\u2019s Monday in American politics.",

      "bodyText": "Two lawmakers from Amazon\u2019s hometown in Seattle traveled to New York on Monday to warn the city of potential unintended consequences of the tech company\u2019s planned new headquarters. Lisa Herbold and Teresa Mosqueda, members of Seattle\u2019s city council, addressed a summit of activist groups fighting Amazon\u2019s plan for a new campus in Long Island City, Queens. They told the New Yorkers that Amazon\u2019s presence in the west coast city had driven up housing costs, that the company had ducked efforts to make them help pay to address the crisis, and that they should resist it. At the event at the offices of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which is attempting to organize workers at a Staten Island Amazon warehouse, the council members urged their New York counterparts to learn from Seattle\u2019s mistakes and demand concessions like labor standards before the company gains a foothold in the city. \u201cDon\u2019t be the city or state that flinches every time a corporation flexes its muscles,\u201d Mosqueda said. \u201cYou have the opportunity that Seattle didn\u2019t,\u201d she added. \u201cWe didn\u2019t respond fast enough.\u201d Amazon opted to split its vaunted HQ2 into two campuses, in New York and Arlington, Virginia, at the end of a nationwide competition. In Long Island City, the company plans to hire 25,000 employees making an average wage of $150,000. The state and city have promised it up to $3bn in tax breaks and public subsidies, sparking a backlash among local politicians, labor unions, and activist groups. But public opinion polls show that a majority of voters back the project, and Amazon has launched an ad campaign touting the benefits it says it will bring, including $27bn in tax revenue. In Seattle, Amazon occupied 20% of the city\u2019s office space, the politicians said. They said New York could expect many of the well-paying jobs to go not to existing city residents, but to people who will move there. A thousand people a week move to the Seattle region, with an influx of more than 115,000 since the beginning of the decade, Mosqueda said. \u201cThe majority of the population that was living in Seattle who were low income, working families has been pushed out \u2026 to areas where they are still now having to commute one and two hours into their jobs,\u201d she said. The less affluent have been pushed to areas south of the city, as housing costs have jumped \u2013 from 35% above the national average in 2012, to 113% above last year. The median cost of a home is $740,000, according to the lawmaker\u2019s presentation. \u201cMore families are getting pushed further and further out, and the demographics in Seattle are dramatically changing,\u201d Mosqueda said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting whiter, and it\u2019s getting richer.\u201d Seattle moved to impose a $275-per-employee \u201chead tax\u201d on large employers like Amazon to help pay for homeless services and public housing, but repealed it under heavy opposition from the company. \u201cOur employee hours tax proposal was a threat to Amazon because it could be replicated all over the country,\u201d Herbold said. \u201cWe simply weren\u2019t able to counter the influence of big money on public opinion.\u201d In an email to the Guardian after publication of this story, an Amazon spokesperson said the company was \u201cengaging in a long-term listening and engagement process to better understand the community\u2019s needs\u201d. The spokesperson said Amazon had \u201ccreated more than 250,000 full-time, full benefit jobs across the US that now have a minimum $15 an hour pay and \u2026 invested more than $160bn in the US economy since 2011.\u201d",

We\u2019re going to teach you those of the law.\u201d Dettinger, 37, was French light-heavyweight champion in 2007 and 2008 and retired from the sport in 2013. His former trainer Jacky Trompesauce said his actions were \u201cout of character\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s a top-level sportsman, a respectful man, not a yob \u2026 perhaps he couldn\u2019t stomach what the gendarmes were doing to people weaker than them,\u201d Trompesauce told journalists. Laurent Boucher, another former coach, told France Inter radio. \u201cI think he lost it. People can be impulsive.\u201d In a video posted on Facebook the evening before handing himself in to police, Dettinger said he \u201cboiled over\u201d after being tear-gassed with his wife on his eighth Saturday protest. \u201cI reacted badly. Yes, I reacted badly,\u201d he said in the video, adding he had seen the \u201crepression\u201d of the police towards protesters. \u201cI\u2019m demonstrating for all the pensioners, for the future of my children, for single women, for everything we\u2019re fighting for. I am a gilet jaune. I have the anger of the people in me \u2026 it\u2019s always the little people who pay.\u201d Dettinger also denied reports he supported the far right or far left saying he was just \u201cproud to be French\u201d. He appealed for protestors to continue the struggle \u201cpeacefully\u201d. In Toulon, officials said an internal investigation had been launched into the actions of police commander Didier Andrieux, seen attacking several gilets jaunes protesters. Le Parisien said the officer had been given a warning in 2015 after an alleged incident with another police officer. The French authorities said a total of 50,000 protesters took part in an eighth successive weekend of demonstrations across the country. A third video, shared widely on social networks, showed protesters using a forklift truck to break down the entrance to a ministry annexe housing government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux on Saturday afternoon. Griveaux was taken out of a back door during the incident. Gilets jaunes protests began in November to oppose proposed rises in fuel taxes. The movement has since enlarged to encompass wider grievances against the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his centrist government. Protesters have rejected concessions announced by Macron aimed at responding to public anger. On Sunday, hundreds of women in yellow vests marched in several French cities carrying yellow balloons. Karen, a nurse from Marseilles, said the aim was to give \u201canother image\u201d of the movement. \u201cAll that\u2019s in the media regarding this movement is acts of violence, while everyone is forgetting what is at the root of the problem,\u201d she told Le Parisien.",

The incident took place in Canary Wharf station in London Docklands on Monday afternoon. Police have given no information about the person who died and said they were working to inform their relatives on Monday evening. Officers from British Transport Police said the incident happened at about 3pm. \u201cColleagues from the London ambulance service also attended. However, a person was sadly pronounced dead at the scene \u2026 This incident is not currently being treated as suspicious and a file will be prepared for the coroner.\u201d A London ambulance service spokeswoman said: \u201cWe were called at 2.57pm today to reports of an incident at Canary Wharf underground station. We sent a number of resources including an ambulance crew, a paramedic in a car, an incident response officer, and we also dispatched London\u2019s air ambulance. \u201cSadly, despite the efforts of our medics, a person died at the scene.\u201d The incident happened in full view of many commuters. One told the Daily Mirror they had heard the person fall, before rushing to their aid. The witness, whom the paper did not name, said he had felt for a pulse but realised the victim had died, which sparked panic among others present.",

The UK believes this would force the EU to negotiate in good faith, would allow a realistic amount of time to conclude the free-trade deal, and above all, to limit the Irish backstop to a maximum of a year. \u201cIf we can\u2019t get a free-trade deal agreed by the end of 2020, then what\u2019s the next jumping off point?\u201d a Whitehall source said. \u201cThat\u2019s the area we are poking about in.\u201d The prime minister insisted over the weekend that the delayed vote on the deal would take place in the Commons next Tuesday despite widespread doubts that Downing Street had any hope of success. There are 81 days until Brexit is due to take place on 29 March, and Downing Street would not rule out MPs sitting over the half-term if that proved necessary. \u201cWe\u2019ll do whatever is required to get the relevant legislation in place,\u201d May\u2019s spokesman said. A deadline is one of three elements of a package \u2013 along with strengthened parliamentary oversight and a commitment to keeping open trade between Northern Ireland and Britain \u2013 designed to address MPs\u2019 concerns that commitments to avoid a hard Irish border will shackle Britain to Brussels indefinitely. Downing Street will step up no-deal preparations, with a radio publicity campaign on commercial stations that will start on Tuesday morning. The adverts are intended to help answer questions the public may have, although will inevitably lead to accusations that ministers are trying to frighten the public. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said that in addition to May\u2019s conversations with Jean-Claude Juncker, she had also spoken to France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, on Friday, at the conclusion of a week of high-level diplomacy in an attempt to obtain fresh language to get her deal over the line. May also spoke to Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, on Wednesday, in addition to previously disclosed calls to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Donald Tusk, the European council president. She was also in contact with the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, her spokesman said.",

      "bodyText": "Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has used a nationally broadcast address to demand that he be allowed to confront live on television the states\u2019 witnesses who have implicated him in three corruption cases. In a bizarre performance worthy of Donald Trump, Netanyahu suggested that the best resolution to his legal issues, which have cast a shadow over his hopes of re-election, should be a reality TV moment where he faces his accusers. \u201cWhat are they afraid of? I\u2019m not afraid. I have nothing to lose,\u201d Netanyahu said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m willing for it to be livestreamed for the public to hear the full truth. I\u2019m confident in my truth.\u201d He described the investigation against him as \u201cbiased\u201d. The speech, which had been billed as a \u201cdramatic announcement\u201d, was the latest effort by Netanyahu to push back against the investigation and the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit. It has been widely reported that Mandelblit is considering indicting Netanyahu before the elections on 9 April. Netanyahu also used his national podium to accuse police investigators of ignoring other witnesses he claims could have testified in his favour. The live statement from the prime minister\u2019s residence caught even seasoned Netanyahu-watchers in Israel by surprise, coming just weeks after he called elections. Israeli fraud investigators have recommended charges against Netanyahu in three long-running investigations: Case 1000, involving gifts from wealthy businessmen allegedly in exchange for favours; Case 2000, in which he is accused of colluding with a media organisation in exchange for favourable coverage; and Case 4000, involving a major Israeli telecoms company. While Netanyahu has vociferously denied any wrongdoing \u2013 insisting he will continue to serve as prime minister and run for re-election \u2013 any indictments announced so close would inevitably prompt calls for him to step aside. Netanyahu\u2019s televised speech was immediately condemned by the Labor party leader, Avi Gabai. \u201cIn a normal country, a prime minister does not behave this way. In a normal country, the prime minister does not attack the law enforcement authorities,\u201d Gabai said. The leader of the opposition, Shelly Yachimovich, described the speech as \u201ca cynical and pathetic elections speech of someone who is trying with all his might to escape the law\u201d. During a visit to Brazil last week to meet the country\u2019s new far-right leader, Jair Bolsonaro, Netanyahu insisted that he would not need to resign even if he was indicted. Netanyahu said: \u201cIsrael is a country ruled by law and according to the law,\u201d adding that \u201ca prime minister doesn\u2019t have to resign\u201d because of \u201ca hearing process\u201d. Commenting on the prospect of an imminent indictment, he said: \u201cIf that happens, I won\u2019t resign. Imagine what happens if you oust a prime minister before the end of the hearing process, and at the end of the hearing it is decided to close the case.

      "bodyText": "The Birmingham Civil Rights Institute in Alabama has come under fire after it rescinded a decision to honor the activist and academic Angela Davis. Davis, a Birmingham native, has spent decades fighting for civil rights. She was an active member of the Black Panther party, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the US communist party. She is now an outspoken supporter of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement that protests Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians. It is this ideological affinity that appears to have inspired the revocation of the BCRI honor. BCRI president and chief executive Andrea Taylor said in October the institute would be \u201cthrilled to bestow this honor\u201d on Davis, who she said was \u201cone of the most globally recognized champions of human rights, giving voice to those who are powerless to speak\u201d. But on Saturday the BCRI announced that in late December, \u201csupporters and other concerned individuals and organizations, both inside and outside of our local community, began to make requests that we reconsider our decision\u201d. Its statement added that \u201cupon closer examination of Davis\u2019 statements and public record, we concluded that she unfortunately does not meet all of the criteria\u201d for the Fred Shuttlesworth Human Rights award. The statement did not indicate what criteria it found Davis did not meet, or identify the origin of the requests to reconsider. Davis said she was \u201cstunned\u201d by the decision. In a statement expressing \u201cdismay\u201d, Birmingham mayor Randall Woodfin said the protests came from the \u201clocal Jewish community and some of its allies\u201d. He called it a reactive and divisive decision and offered to facilitate dialogue in response. On social media, many people responded with outrage. To some, the reference to \u201callies\u201d was a critical clue. Sophie Ellman-Golan, an activist who works for the Women\u2019s March, called the decision \u201cdisgraceful\u201d but said she doubted Jews in Alabama could have effectively lobbied for such a move alone. \u201cThe idea that Jews in Alabama \u2013 as opposed to the many Christian Zionists in Alabama \u2013 have the structural power to make this happen should give us pause,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s the Jews\u2019 is an all-too-frequently-used explanation.\u201d Conservative evangelical Christians, who dominate the political landscape of the southern US, have long held strong Zionist positions for political and scriptural reasons. Ahmad Ward, an 18-year-veteran of the BCRI who left in 2017, said he had \u201cnothing but pure, profound love\u201d for the Institute but called the decision to revoke Davis\u2019s award an insult to the legacy of Shuttlesworth, a Birmingham minister and civil rights activist. \u201cI spent an inordinate amount of time with Fred L Shuttlesworth,\u201d Ward wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cHe was a warrior. He was defiant. He was steadfast and solid. \u201cHe WOULD NOT agree with this. I am personally offended at that statement. The unmitigated gall to assume that Fred L Shuttlesworth would be OK with the disrespect inflicted on Professor Davis is maddening.\u201d Marc Lamont Hill, a CNN contributor who was released after making pro-Palestinian remarks in a November speech, called the decision \u201cshameful\u201d. \u201cI stand with my dear sister and friend Angela Davis,\u201d Hill wrote in a tweet. According to the BCRI, which opened in 1992, recipients of the Fred Shuttlesworth award must \u201cembody the principles that guided the American civil rights movement\u201d, including the \u201cphilosophy of non-violence and reconciliation\u201d. Former winners include politicians John Lewis and Eleanor Holmes Norton, actor Danny Glover and attorney Bryan Stevenson.

      "bodyText": "His debut The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle might be being praised as an \u201cingenious, intriguing and highly original mindbender of a murder mystery\u201d by judges after it landed the Costa first novel award, but author Stuart Turton says that the process of writing it was \u201cjust awful\u201d. On Monday night, Turton was announced as the winner of the \u00a35,000 award for his genre-bending debut, in which Evelyn is murdered hundreds of times at a party thrown by her parents. The only way to break the cycle is for Aidan \u2013 who wakes each morning, Groundhog Day-style, in the body of a different guest \u2013 to identify her killer. Chosen as winner from 117 entries, The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle is, said judges, \u201cfresh, enticing and completely unputdownable\u201d. \u201cWe were all stunned that this exciting and accomplished novel, planned and plotted perfectly, is a debut,\u201d said the panel. The prize has previously gone to massive bestsellers such as Gail Honeyman\u2019s Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine, Nathan Filer\u2019s The Shock of the Fall and Zadie Smith\u2019s White Teeth. Turton, a 38-year-old freelance journalist from Widnes, Cheshire, never had a burning desire to be an author, but as an Agatha Christie fan since childhood, he had always wanted to write a golden age crime novel with a \u201cRoger Ackroyd kind of twist\u201d. A \u201cphenomenally bad\u201d attempt when he was 21 pointed him elsewhere, travelling the world and working in bookshops, airports and goat ranches, even cleaning toilets, until he became a journalist. He was working as a travel writer in Dubai when the idea that would become Evelyn Hardcastle struck him. \u201cIt was the body-hopping and the Groundhog Day loop. I didn\u2019t have anything else, the characters or murder, I just had that concept. The moment I got it, I thought: \u2018Oh crap, now I\u2019ve got to go and do that, and I\u2019ve got to be in England, I need that atmosphere, those stately homes. I need to be lost in drizzly forests, I cannot do that in the desert,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI was terrified the entire time, from the moment the idea came and I knew I had to follow through on it.\u201d Back in London, the novel still didn\u2019t come easily. \u201cThe more I planned it, the more I tried to wrap these knots together, the more complicated it became. It was just awful for about a year,\u201d he says. \u201cI must have been horrible to be around because my mind was being pulled in about 18 directions. I\u2019d given so much up, convinced my girlfriend to come [to London], and I didn\u2019t think I could pull it off. Eventually I started having fun with it. The second year, I saw a glimmer in it that it could actually work, and that was amazing.\u201d Turton\u2019s debut is one of five winners in the Costa awards, which go to the \u201cmost enjoyable\u201d books by authors resident in the UK and Ireland. Sally Rooney\u2019s second novel Normal People, about the relationship between two youngsters in post-Celtic Tiger Ireland, has taken this year\u2019s Costa novel award, beating 172 contenders including Pat Barker\u2019s The Silence of the Girls and Tom Rachman\u2019s The Italian Teacher. Rooney\u2019s win makes the 27-year-old the youngest ever recipient of the novel category, for a book that judges called a \u201ctrailblazing novel about modern life and love that will electrify any reader\u201d. Bart van Es, an Oxford professor, won the biography award for his memoir The Cut Out Girl, which centres on the true story of a young Jewish girl who hid from the Nazis with a network of foster families in Holland during the second world war, and which judges called \u201cthe hidden gem of the year\u201d. The poetry category went to the Scottish poet JO Morgan for Assurances, which draws from his father\u2019s role as an officer in the RAF involved in the \u201cAirborne Nuclear Deterrent\u201d during the cold war. \u201cWe were all gripped by this polyphonic book-length poem and dazzled by its originality and inventiveness,\u201d said judges. The Costa children\u2019s book award, won in the past by Philip Pullman, was taken this year by Hilary McKay\u2019s The Skylarks\u2019 War. Set during the first world war, it is \u201cas perfect a novel as you could ever want to read,\u201d according to judges. Chosen from 641 entries in total, the five category winners will now go on to compete for the Costa book of the year, which is worth \u00a330,000 and was won posthumously last year by Helen Dunmore with her final poetry collection Inside the Wave.

A \u201cclinical review\u201d of existing targets, led by NHS England\u2019s medical director, Prof Steve Powis, and which the prime minister ordered, is expected to recommend changes when it reports in the spring.</p> <p>Hospitals\u2019 growing inability to give patients A&amp;E, cancer care and planned operations within the prescribed maximum waiting times has regularly yielded bad headlines for ministers and NHS managers since performance slipped significantly in 2015 and has since got worse.</p> <p>For example, the obligation to give 92% of patients non-urgent surgery within 18 weeks has not been met since February 2016. Similarly, the NHS has proved unable to give cancer patients urgent treatment within 62 days of referral by a GP in all but one month since April 2014.</p> <p>NHS Providers, which represents trusts, has estimated that it would cost the health service \u00a34bn-\u00a35bn to get back to delivering care within the targets in all three areas of care. NHS leaders privately believe that chronic understaffing and growing demand mean it is unlikely that hospitals will be able to recover their previous levels of performance in the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Any unwinding of the four-hour target would provoke a row. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine, which speaks for A&amp;E doctors, is opposed to any rowback. It believes the target is not only popular with patients but helps to concentrate the minds of NHS staff and ensure no one needing care is left untreated for too long.</p> <p>However, some hospital managers believe the duty \u2013 introduced by the last Labour government \u2013 has encouraged some people with only minor ailments to view A&amp;E as a service that will treat \u201canything and everything\u201d within four hours rather than just deal with accidents and emergencies.</p> <p>Stevens told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the NHS planned to bring in quicker treatment for the most seriously ill and injured A&amp;E patients. Sources said this could lead to those with only small problems no longer being dealt with inside four hours.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe problem with [the target] is it doesn\u2019t distinguish between turning up at A&amp;E with a sprained finger versus turning up with a heart attack. What senior doctors are telling us is that they think that the standards should focus particularly on those major conditions \u2013 like sepsis, heart attack and stroke. <br><br>\u201cThe top doctors in the NHS are looking at what are the most appropriate clinical standards to improve outcomes in emergency care. They will make their recommendations and, on the back of that, we will meet them.\u201d</p> <p>The referral-to-treatment (RTT) target, which guarantees that 92% of people awaiting a non-urgent operation will have their surgery within 18 weeks, could also change as a result of Powis\u2019s team considering switching to a policy known as clinical prioritisation.</p> <p>The prime minister fuelled speculation that the RTT target could be relaxed when, helping Stevens to publicise the new NHS plan, she said: \u201cWe do need to look at performance against existing targets but, as we look ahead for the NHS, let\u2019s make sure we are setting standards that are the right standards for the future.\u201d</p> <p>Derek Alderson, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said it would not support any change to the \u201cincreasingly forgotten\u201d 18-week target.</p> <p>\u201cPatients in pain needing a heart, brain, or any other type of operation will wonder how a longer wait fits with today\u2019s vision of an improving health service. While we support plans to review the existing targets, particularly to see whether those in greater clinical need can be treated more quickly, we would not support changes that do not assure patients that they will be seen quickly,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "NHS leaders are preparing to risk a backlash by relaxing long-established key treatment waiting time targets, including hospitals\u2019 duty to deal with A&amp;E patients within four hours. Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, admitted it was considering changing the system under which 95% of A&amp;E arrivals were meant to be seen and admitted, discharged or transferred within four hours. The shake-up could see people with only minor ailments, such as a sprain, forced to wait longer, while priority is given to those with more serious conditions. Theresa May also hinted at a new approach to targets at the launch of the NHS long-term plan when she said that doctors needed to decide what were \u201cthe right standards for the future\u201d. A \u201cclinical review\u201d of existing targets, led by NHS England\u2019s medical director, Prof Steve Powis, and which the prime minister ordered, is expected to recommend changes when it reports in the spring. Hospitals\u2019 growing inability to give patients A&amp;E, cancer care and planned operations within the prescribed maximum waiting times has regularly yielded bad headlines for ministers and NHS managers since performance slipped significantly in 2015 and has since got worse. For example, the obligation to give 92% of patients non-urgent surgery within 18 weeks has not been met since February 2016. Similarly, the NHS has proved unable to give cancer patients urgent treatment within 62 days of referral by a GP in all but one month since April 2014. NHS Providers, which represents trusts, has estimated that it would cost the health service \u00a34bn-\u00a35bn to get back to delivering care within the targets in all three areas of care. NHS leaders privately believe that chronic understaffing and growing demand mean it is unlikely that hospitals will be able to recover their previous levels of performance in the foreseeable future. Any unwinding of the four-hour target would provoke a row. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine, which speaks for A&amp;E doctors, is opposed to any rowback. It believes the target is not only popular with patients but helps to concentrate the minds of NHS staff and ensure no one needing care is left untreated for too long. However, some hospital managers believe the duty \u2013 introduced by the last Labour government \u2013 has encouraged some people with only minor ailments to view A&amp;E as a service that will treat \u201canything and everything\u201d within four hours rather than just deal with accidents and emergencies. Stevens told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the NHS planned to bring in quicker treatment for the most seriously ill and injured A&amp;E patients. Sources said this could lead to those with only small problems no longer being dealt with inside four hours. He said: \u201cThe problem with [the target] is it doesn\u2019t distinguish between turning up at A&amp;E with a sprained finger versus turning up with a heart attack. What senior doctors are telling us is that they think that the standards should focus particularly on those major conditions \u2013 like sepsis, heart attack and stroke. \u201cThe top doctors in the NHS are looking at what are the most appropriate clinical standards to improve outcomes in emergency care. They will make their recommendations and, on the back of that, we will meet them.\u201d The referral-to-treatment (RTT) target, which guarantees that 92% of people awaiting a non-urgent operation will have their surgery within 18 weeks, could also change as a result of Powis\u2019s team considering switching to a policy known as clinical prioritisation. The prime minister fuelled speculation that the RTT target could be relaxed when, helping Stevens to publicise the new NHS plan, she said: \u201cWe do need to look at performance against existing targets but, as we look ahead for the NHS, let\u2019s make sure we are setting standards that are the right standards for the future.\u201d Derek Alderson, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said it would not support any change to the \u201cincreasingly forgotten\u201d 18-week target. \u201cPatients in pain needing a heart, brain, or any other type of operation will wonder how a longer wait fits with today\u2019s vision of an improving health service. While we support plans to review the existing targets, particularly to see whether those in greater clinical need can be treated more quickly, we would not support changes that do not assure patients that they will be seen quickly,\u201d he said.",

Bolton and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Joseph Dunford, are in Turkey, as the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is due to begin a tour of Arab capitals on Tuesday, largely to reassure allies and clarify policy after the president\u2019s abrupt announcement last month that the Islamic State had been defeated in Syria and the roughly 2,000 US troops still in the country would be leaving. Trump made the decision on the spur of the moment halfway through a telephone conversation on 14 December 2018 with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who had urged him to leave the counter-terrorist effort in northern Syria to Turkey. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, sharply criticised Bolton for his insistence that Turkey not attack Kurdish Syrian forces who have fought with the US against Isis.

And once that\u2019s done, then you talk about a timetable.\u201d Bolton said that one of those conditions would be the total destruction of Isis, who the president had claimed had already been defeated. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear, we\u2019re going to withdraw, we\u2019re going to protect American forces during the withdrawal period, but the president also expects it would be able to accomplish the destruction of the Isis territorial caliphate, and other Isis personnel and facilities that are potentially dangerous to us as we leave,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cIt\u2019s also very important that as we discuss with members of the coalition [and] other countries that have an interest, like Israel and Turkey, that we expect that those who have fought with us in Syria in the opposition, particularly the Kurds but everybody who\u2019s fought with us, who\u2019s not put in jeopardy by the coalition withdrawal.\u201d US troops, as well as special forces from the UK and France, have fought alongside the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to oust Isis from almost all its \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Syria. The SDF is led by the Kurdish Protection Units (YPG) which has strong links with Kurdish Workers\u2019 party (PKK) militants in Turkey, a source of constant tension between Ankara and Washington. \u201cThe issue is PKK/YPG are making efforts to establish an order by oppressing Kurds who don\u2019t obey them, and by their terrorist activities against our country,\u201d Kalin said, in a rebuke to Bolton. \u201cThere is no doubt that a terror group cannot be an ally of the US.\u201d \u201cThere is deep disappointment in Ankara with the US administration, and right now Turkish policy-makers are trying to assess whether this is a policy shift or whether it is empty words and the policy will change again,\u201d Sinan \u00dclgen, a former Turkish diplomat and a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Europe thinktank. The White House denied there had been a policy shift, and Trump went on Twitter on Monday to denounce the New York Times for its reporting of Bolton\u2019s comments. \u201cNo different from my original statements, we will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!..\u201d Trump tweeted. Bolton retweeted the president, adding \u201cMy thoughts exactly. Pompeo said in an interview published on Monday: \u201cWe need to have long conversations with the Turks about what this will look like after withdrawal.\u201d The secretary of state said that the US would maintain its relationship with the Syrian Kurds. \u201cWe will find a relationship with them that accommodates all of our interests,\u201d he told Bloomberg News. Pompeo is due to embark on a tour of eight Arab capitals, with the aim of steadying alliances in the wake of Trump\u2019s surprises announcement and the subsequent resignation of US defence secretary James Mattis. Trump tweeted on 19 December: \u201cWe have defeated Isis in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump presidency.\u201d During his heated phone call with Erdo\u011fan five days earlier, he is reported to have declared: \u201cOK, it\u2019s all yours. We are done.\u201d By Sunday, however, he appeared to agree with Bolton that the withdrawal would be conditional. \u201cWe are pulling back in Syria. We\u2019re going to be removing our troops,\u201d he told reporters. But he added: \u201cWe won\u2019t be finally pulled out until Isis is gone.\u201d Nicholas Heras, a fellow at the Centre for a New American Security, said: \u201cI think there is an intramural battle going on within the administration by the designated Syria policy team, trying to repair damage done by the president\u2019s announcement.\u201d He added: \u201cTrump came off a bad month in December and thought that the Syria announcement would be a quick win for his base.\u201d",

The C$6.2bn (US$4.6bn) project is part of a broader plan to ramp up natural gas exports in the province. The company has previously said it has the support of all elected indigenous leaders along the proposed route, but Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en hereditary chiefs have signaled they do not support the project \u2013 and argue that elected band leaders are not in the position to negotiate with the company. \u201cThey\u2019re not the title-holders or the caretakers of the land. The hereditary chiefs are,\u201d said Madeek. The pipeline project has previously faced numerous delays, after a group of protesters constructed a blockade \u2013 named Unist\u2019ot\u2019en Camp \u2013 in order to prevent construction vehicles from accessing the area. On 14 December, a British Columbia court granted TransCanada an injunction permitting them access to the construction site and ordering the removal of the blockade. Within days, activists erected the new barrier, named the Gidimt\u2019en checkpoint. On Sunday, Unist\u2019ot\u2019en Camp issued a statement of support for the Gidimt\u2019en checkpoint: \u201cThe RCMP\u2019s ultimatum, to allow TransCanada access to unceded Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en territory or face police invasion, is an act of war. Canada is now attempting to do what it has always done \u2013 criminalize and use violence against indigenous people so that their unceded homelands can be exploited for profit.\u201d Both the Unist\u2019ot\u2019en and Gitimd\u2019en are part of the five clans which make up the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en. In recent years, British Columbia has been the site of a number of high-profile legal cases surrounding the issue of land title. Because few of the province\u2019s First Nations signed treaties with colonial governments, the courts have often been the arbiters of land rights disputes. The Delgamuukw v British Columbia case \u2013 which covers part of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en territory \u2013 previously found that indigenous rights to their historical territory are not \u201cextinguished\u201d for lack of a treaty. Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en claim they retain title to the land and as a result, have sole authority to deny or grant access to the territory. The pipeline feud comes as energy companies in Canada are facing numerous delays and barriers to their infrastructure projects, including environmental assessments and adequate consultations with indigenous communities on whose territory the projects would pass through. Another high-profile pipeline project, Trans Mountain, was halted over the summer after a federal court determined indigenous communities had not been adequately consulted during the approvals process. British Columbia premier John Horgan, who made headlines for his fight against the Trans Mountain pipeline, has cheered on the C$40bn liquid natural gas project \u2013 of which the Coastal GasLink is a critical piece \u2013 citing the large number of jobs and revenue that will result from its completion. While the provincial government has said the facility will be the cleanest of its kind in the world, a report from the Pembina Institute found that the project would increase the province\u2019s emissions by 8.6 megatonnes by 2030. Protesters at the Gitimd\u2019en checkpoint have vowed to prevent the project from being built on their territory. \u201cThis is what we\u2019re here for, is to protect the 22,000 sq km and this section of the territory for our grandchildren and our great-great-grandchildren that aren\u2019t even born yet so they can enjoy what we enjoy today out on the territory,\u201d said Madeek. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 January 2019 to make clear that a photograph shows protesters at a demonstration against a separate pipeline project in March 2018",

Since the referendum, 36% of the 222 UK financial services firms tracked by EY have either confirmed or said they are considering relocating staff or operations to the continent. That figure jumps to 56% when accounting just for universal banks, investment banks and brokerages. The report highlighted that many companies had taken additional steps in recent months to ensure \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for clients, with at least two retail banks setting aside extra cash to help manage the uncertainty over Brexit. RBS said in October it was setting aside \u00a3100m to cover any potential hit from \u201cthe more uncertain economic outlook\u201d. Ali said: \u201cInevitably, the contingency plans are for day one only, and in the event of no deal will represent the tip of the iceberg as longer-term plans will be more strategic and extensive than those publicly announced to date.\u201d",

That would require the consent of the other 27 member states. That would also raise all sorts of practical issues, not least the timing of the European parliamentary elections at the end of May.

She told MPs that the permanent secretary at the Department for Transport demanded a written ministerial instruction before approving some no-deal Brexit spending. This is a relatively unusual procedure; it is what happens when civil servants doubt whether an item of spending can be justified, and as a result insist on ministers taking responsibility in writing. (\u201cArse covering\u201d, as they would call in a normal workplace, but the civil service being the civil service,<a href=\"https://www.civilservant.org.uk/directions-overview.html\"> there\u2019s a whole protocol for this, framed in more refined language.)</a></p> \n  <p>Goodman told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When a permanent secretary is not happy about being asked to spend money, they seek a written ministerial instruction to make it proper.

Doesn\u2019t this prove that no deal is a bluff?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In response, <strong>Stephen Barclay</strong>, the Brexit secretary, did not challenge what was saying.

The SNP used it to delegitimise claims about the supposed dire economic effects of independence, and the term was widely adopted because it seemed a fair assessment of what was a largely negative campaign (although a negative campaign that worked - the no camp won decisively.)</p> \n  <p>Since 2016 Brexiters have been using the same term to discredit claims made about the negative consequences of Brexit. It was striking to hear Corbyn use the term because for a moment it made him sound like Jacob Rees-Mogg, as some journalists have highlighted.</p> \n  <p>From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s <strong>Dan Hodges</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DPJHodges/status/1082307826188541952\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So Jeremy Corbyn is now echoing Farage, the ERG and the other hard-core Brexiteers by describing No Deal Brexit planning as \"Project Fear\".

Speaking to the Press Association about his speech earlier today,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/07/uk-must-have-second-eu-referendum-chris-patten-tory\"> backing a second referendum on Brexit,</a> the former Tory chairman said Thatcher would have opposed May\u2019s Brexit deal because it gives too much power to the remaining 27 EU states. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think Margaret Thatcher would have been horrified at the idea that we should negotiate things that are really going to matter to our future in circumstances in which 27 EU member states each have a right to veto what we want to do. </p> \n   <p>Because from the end of March onwards, if we go out on Mrs May\u2019s terms every member state has a veto on what we want. </p> \n   <p>At the moment, things have to be decided by a qualified majority, but after the end of March it\u2019s a vote for everybody.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Patten was referring to the fact that, under May\u2019s proposals, the UK would leave the EU on 29 March and then negotiate a future trade deal. That deal will have to be approved unanimously by the remaining EU states. </p> \n  <p>(By contrast, the EU only needed to agree the withdrawal agreement by a \u201csuper\u201d qualified majority - 72% of states, comprising at least 65% of the population of those states in total - although in practice the withdrawal deal was agreed unanimously.)</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a846a3d1e400720057d2b29fc55948d58ae5e794\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a846a3d1e400720057d2b29fc55948d58ae5e794/0_131_3074_1844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Patten speaking at a People's Vote event earlier.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Patten speaking at a People\u2019s Vote event earlier.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-07T17:39:54.956Z\">at 5.39pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c336c4be4b02fb91ff0fd1d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-07T15:13:01.346Z\">3.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>My colleague <strong>Peter Walker</strong> has been watching work and pensions questions in the Commons.

Should talks on a sufficiently comprehensive and deep future trade deal be agreed and ratified by the the start of 2021, it is hoped there would be no need for the whole of the UK to fall into the customs union envisaged by that \u2018all-weather\u2019 solution for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. On a visit to a hospital in Liverpool, May said this about the assurances that she hopes to offer MPs before the vote on her Brexit deal, planned for Tuesday next week. She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In the coming days, what we will set out is not just about the EU but also about what we can do domestically. </p> \n   <p>So we will be setting out measures which will be specific to Northern Ireland, we will be setting out proposals for a greater role for Parliament as we move into the next stage of the negotiation and we are continuing to work on further assurances on further undertakings from the European Union in relation to the concern that has been expressed by parliamentarians.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>At the Number 10 lobby briefing the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said further details of the debate would be revealed in due course.

It will also take over the work of the inter-ministerial groups (IMGs) on EU exit and borders, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said. He told the lobby briefing:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The intention is to streamline the process to oversee the delivery of plans for an orderly exit from the EU. The IMGs were not previously decision-making bodies so this brings this together in an orderly and coherent manner.</p> \n   <p>The 21-member committee will include secretaries of state for the Whitehall departments directly involved in Brexit planning as well as the chief whip Julian Smith and the attorney general Geoffrey Cox. Its remit will include contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit, engagement with Brussels and EU member states on no-deal readiness and the provision of \u201cclear direction and co-ordination across HMG\u201d.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>May has been criticised for saying that Brexit will help to pay for the planned extra \u00a320.5bn being allocated to the NHS. </strong>In her speech at the Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool, she said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Over the next five years \u2013 the NHS England budget will increase by \u00a320.5bn in real terms compared to today. This commitment is possible because of our strong public finances, and because as we leave the EU and take back control of our money, we will no longer be sending vast annual sums to Brussels.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This claim is contentious because, even though Brexit will generate a direct saving for the government, because it will not have to pay contributions to the EU, allowing money to go to the NHS instead, most economists think this will not compensate for the indirect losses that Brexit will generate, because tax revenues will be lower.

There is some evidence of this in the Daily Telegraph this morning, where <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, has used <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/01/06/british-people-wont-scared-backing-woeful-brexit-deal-nobody/\">his regular column (paywall)</a> to claim that a no-deal Brexit is \u201cclosest to what people actually voted for\u201d.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Time and again the Brexit debate turns into a tribute to the wisdom of the British people \u2013 and their instinctive ability to sort fact from nonsense. Over the last few weeks, they have been bombarded with warnings of what could happen to this country in the event of a \u201cno-deal Brexit\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/01/04/time-goes-people-waking-benefits-mitigated-no-deal/\">otherwise known as coming out on World Trade terms</a>. Whether prompted by No 10 or not, establishment figures have taken to the airwaves to warn of the perils of rejecting Theresa May\u2019s lamentable Withdrawal Agreement; and we now have a cumulative forecast that is downright apocalyptic ...</p> \n   <p>For weeks the public have been regaled with this stuff \u2013 and yet an astonishing thing has happened: the grimmer the warnings, and the more systematic the efforts to make their flesh creep, the greater has been their indifference and their resolve. Of all the options suggested by pollsters \u2013 staying in the EU, coming out on Theresa May\u2019s terms, or coming out on World Trade terms \u2013 it is the last, the so-called no-deal option, that is gaining in popularity. In spite of \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 everything they have been told, it is this future that is by some margin preferred by the British public.</p> \n   <p>What is going on? What is it that gives so many of the electorate the confidence to dismiss these prognostications? The most obvious answer, perhaps, is that this option is closest to what people actually voted for. When 17.4 million chose to leave the EU, they didn\u2019t vote to stay locked in the customs union or the single market. There was no suggestion that we would pay \u00a339 billion for nothing, without even a sniff of a trade deal with Brussels.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Like many of Johnson\u2019s Brexit assertions, this is, even on the most generous of assessments, questionable. Trading with the EU on WTO terms would involve tariffs. But readers will remember Johnson and Vote Leave assuring the country in 2016 that Brexit would never come to that because trade barriers of that kind would be unacceptable to German BMW manufacturers and Italian prosecco producers.</p> \n  <p>It is also interesting to note that Johnson seems to be giving up on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45673214\">the \u201cSuperCanada\u201d Brexit plan he used to champion.</a> Canada does not get a mention in his article today.</p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> \n  <p><em>Early morning: </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/07/no-deal-brexit-rehearsal-tests-traffic-congestion-in-kent\">The Department of Transport is carrying out a live trial of an emergency traffic congestion system to be used in Dover in the event of a no-deal Brexit, with 79 lorry drivers participating.</a></p> \n  <p><em>11am: </em>Downing Street lobby briefing.</p> \n  <p><em>11.30am:</em> Lord Patten, the former Conservative cabinet minister, and Sam Gyimah, the former universities minister, speak at a People\u2019s Vote event.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/07/uk-must-have-second-eu-referendum-chris-patten-tory\"> Patten will declare his support for a second referendum.</a></p> \n  <p><em>Late morning:</em> Theresa May visits a hospital to publicise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/07/nhs-to-outline-plan-to-save-half-a-million-lives-over-next-decade\">the government\u2019s new long-term plan for the NHS.</a></p> \n  <p><em>2.30pm: </em>Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> \n  <p><em>3.30pm:</em> Urgent questions and ministerial statements.

      "bodyText": "The Speaker, John Bercow, has urged police to do more to protect MPs outside parliament from abusive protesters after they repeatedly shouted at Conservative MP Anna Soubry that she was a \u201cNazi\u201d as she spoke on live TV. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has played down the revelation that the permanent secretary at the Department for Transport questioned the need for some of the department\u2019s no-deal spending. (See 5.29pm.) Responding to an urgent question on Brexit, Barclay also refused to categorically rule out seeking an extension of article 50; instead, he just said it was the government\u2019s \u201cfirm intention\u201d not to do that. (See 6.03pm.) He also refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit. Asked to do so by the Labour MP Hilary Benn, Barclay said MPs could not just oppose a no-deal Brexit without agreeing an alternative. He said: The core point with ruling out no deal is that the House has to be for something rather than simply to agree what it is against. And, if you look at the signatories on the letter suggesting that no deal should be ruled out, what is clear is the whole spectrum of issues that those members support. The House has to decide what it is for, not simply what it is against. UPDATE: Here is the response from the Department for Transport. Jeremy Corbyn has described the government\u2019s no-deal Brexit planning as \u201cProject Fear\u201d and \u201chot air\u201d. They were a waste of money because there was no support in parliament for a no-deal Brexit, he told MPs. (See 4.34pm.) Labour is to support a backbench amendment tabled by Yvette Cooper that could severely restrict the government\u2019s taxation powers unless a no-deal Brexit is taken off the table. Health leaders have been accused of delaying a flagship target to reduce the number of people with learning disabilities \u201clocked away in mental health hospitals\u201d. As the Press Association reports, NHS England set out plans in 2015 to close 35 to 50% of inpatient beds for people with learning difficulties and autism and provide alternative care in the community by March 2019. But its long-term plan for the NHS, published on Monday, said it was going to reduce inpatient provision by half by 2023-24. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Jonathan Lis, the deputy director of the pro-EU thinktank British Influence, thinks the government will have to request an extension of article 50. It is also worth noting that, during the Brexit UQ, Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, did not categorically rule out extending article 50. Responding to the SNP leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, Barclay said: It is not a unilateral decision as to whether we extend article 50. That would require the consent of the other 27 member states. That would also raise all sorts of practical issues, not least the timing of the European parliamentary elections at the end of May. It is this government\u2019s firm intention not to extend article 50 and to leave the European Union as the prime minister has set out. Later the Tory MP Julian Lewis said Theresa May has told MPs on 74 occasions that the UK will leave the EU on 29 March. He asked Barclay to confirm that \u201cunder no circumstances\u201d would that date be postponed. In reply, Barclay just endorsed what May has already said. There does seem to be a slight softening in the government\u2019s stance on this. In the past Theresa May was happy to say that the UK would be leaving the EU on 29 March this year come what may. But she did not repeat that deadline in her New Year\u2019s message, and in her Andrew Marr interview yesterday (pdf), although she gave a firm no when asked if she would be willing to extend article 50, she gave a curious answer when asked right at the end if she was \u201cabsolutely sure\u201d that the UK would leave at the end of March. She replied: I\u2019ve been clear that we leave the European Union on the 29th March this year. Note the use of the perfect tense. She has been clear in the past. But would she need to put it quite like that if she was still 100% clear about it now? Earlier a caption of a picture showing Chris Patten wrongly said he was speaking at a Vote Leave event. (See 3.29pm.) It was, of course, a People\u2019s Vote event. Sorry. The Brexit UQ is now over, but before it finished Labour\u2019s Helen Goodman came out with an interesting revelation. She told MPs that the permanent secretary at the Department for Transport demanded a written ministerial instruction before approving some no-deal Brexit spending. This is a relatively unusual procedure; it is what happens when civil servants doubt whether an item of spending can be justified, and as a result insist on ministers taking responsibility in writing. (\u201cArse covering\u201d, as they would call in a normal workplace, but the civil service being the civil service, there\u2019s a whole protocol for this, framed in more refined language.) Goodman told MPs: When a permanent secretary is not happy about being asked to spend money, they seek a written ministerial instruction to make it proper. I have today had, in writing from the Department for Transport, confirmation that the permanent secretary at the Department for Transport sought such a ministerial direction. Doesn\u2019t this prove that no deal is a bluff? In response, Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, did not challenge what was saying. Instead he said civil servants used to require ministerial directions when Labour was in power too. (I\u2019m sorry I have not been posting as regularly as normal today. I\u2019ve had a few technical problems. But everything seems to be working fine now.) Here is one of the most striking quotes from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s response to Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary. Corbyn said: [Theresa May] is not here because she is busy promoting \u201cProject Fear\u201d. It\u2019s all hot air. \u201cProject Fear\u201d is the term used by the SNP to attack the no campaign during the Scottish referendum campaign. The SNP used it to delegitimise claims about the supposed dire economic effects of independence, and the term was widely adopted because it seemed a fair assessment of what was a largely negative campaign (although a negative campaign that worked - the no camp won decisively.) Since 2016 Brexiters have been using the same term to discredit claims made about the negative consequences of Brexit. It was striking to hear Corbyn use the term because for a moment it made him sound like Jacob Rees-Mogg, as some journalists have highlighted. From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges From PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield But Tom Hamilton, a former Labour party staffer (although not a Corbynite), has what strikes me as a more convincing account of what Corbyn was saying. This is backed up by something Corbyn said a bit later in his response to Barclay. He said: The government is trying to run down the clock in an attempt to blackmail this House, and the country, into supporting a botched deal. [May] has refused to work with the majority in the last few months in a desperate attempt to spark life into what is actually a Frankenstein\u2019s monster of a deal. We are now told, if we don\u2019t support it, the government is prepared to push our whole economy off a cliff edge. And, to prove this, no-deal preparations are underway ... Even today, we see the farce of lorries being lined up to stage a fake traffic jam in Kent to pretend to the EU that the government is ready for a no deal ... The government is fooling nobody. These shambolic preparations are too little, too late. The reality is there is no majority in this House to support no deal. Why won\u2019t the government face up to this truth and stop wasting our time and our money? Labour\u2019s Chris Leslie asks Barclay to guarantee that the vote will take place next week. He says Barclay ducked this question earlier. He asks again: can Barclay guarantee the vote will take place next week? Barclay replies: \u201cYes.\u201d Anne Main, a Conservative, asks if Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, will come to the Commons to give legal advice on the significance of any new assurances offered by the EU. Barclay says it is not normal for governments to publish their legal advice. But he says it is up to the Commons to decide its own business. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, asks Barclay to rule out a no-deal Brexit. Barclay says it is not enough to MPs to be against something. They have to decide what they want. Referring to the letter, signed by more than 200 MPs, urging the government to rule out a no-deal Brexit, he says those MPs favour a variety of alternative options. Barclay says MPs cannot just oppose a no-deal Brexit without agreeing an alternative. Sir John Redwood, the Tory Brexiter, says it is not just the backstop that makes the withdrawal agreement unacceptable. He says it would involve paying billions to the EU. Barclay says the UK would need the unanimous agreement of the EU 27 to extend article 50. It is not the government\u2019s intention to ask for that, he says. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, urges Labour to get off the fence and oppose Brexit. And, echoing Nicola Sturgeon earlier (see 1.22pm), he says Brexit has strengthened the case for Scottish independence. Ken Clarke, the Conservative pro-European, urges the government to delay Brexit. Barclay says the UK would not be able to revoke article 50 purely as a delaying tactic. There is a difference between extending article 50 and revoking it, he says. He says the European court of justice ruling suggested that, if the UK wants to revoke article 50, that should be a final decision. Barclay is responding to Corbyn. He says Corbyn\u2019s statement was devoid of content. And Labour\u2019s Brexit policy is contradictory, he says. He says Labour has to clarify whether it accepts the EU referendum result, as Corbyn says, or whether it wants a second referendum so it can overturn it, as Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, suggests. UPDATE: Here is CityAM\u2019s Owen Bennett on Corbyn\u2019s statement. Corbyn is responding to Barclay now. He says, with less than three months to go, \u201cthere can be no more hiding and no more running away\u201d. This issue should not be determined by machinations with the Conservative party, he says. He says delaying the vote was \u201cshameful\u201d. May should be here herself to answer questions, he says. He says May is not here because she is promoting \u201cProject Fear\u201d. He goes on: \u201cIt\u2019s all hot air.\u201d He says this morning, on the Today programme, the Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng admitted he did not know what assurances May had been offered by EU leaders. He asks Barclay to say when the vote will be held. The government is threatening to push the whole economy over a cliff edge in the event of a no deal, he says. He says Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, has a PhD in incompetence. And today his department has staged a traffic jam. It is a stunt, he says. He says Labour will hold the government to account. Jeremy Corbyn asks his UQ. (See 3.36pm.) Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is resonding. He says Theresa May is not responding because today she launched the long-term NHS plan. He says on Wednesday MPs will debate a business motion relating to the Brexit debate. The debate will then run on Wednesday and Thursday, and on Friday if MPs vote for the business motion. He says it was clear from the three days of debate held in December that the government\u2019s motion would not passed. He says at their summit in December EU leaders went further than before in giving assurances that the backstop would be temporary. He says May has had further conversations with EU leaders on this over the holiday period. The government will set out what assurances have been received before the debate starts on Wednesday, he says. Jeremy Corbyn is about to ask his Brexit urgent question (UQ). He has asked Theresa May to make a statement \u201con progress made in achieving legal changes to the EU withdrawal agreement and the timetable in this House for the meaningful vote\u201d, but May will not be replying. It will be Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, instead. The pro-Remain Conservative MP Anna Soubry has accused the police of \u201cdoing nothing\u201d to prevent pro-Brexit protesters repeatedly accused her of being a Nazi during a broadcast interview. The unseen protesters could be heard repeatedly chanting \u201cSoubry is a Nazi\u201d during the interview on BBC News. Two police officer in the background appeared not to react to the chants. Soubry broke off the interview to say \u201cI do object to being called a Nazi ... I just think this is astonishing.\u201d As protesters continued to chant the abuse she added: \u201cThis is what has happened to our country\u201d. Later in a tweet about the incident she criticised the lack of police response. She wrote: The Metropolitan Police has been contacted, but has not yet responded to the incident or Soubry\u2019s comments. Chris Patten, who first joined the cabinet when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, has said that she would be \u201chorrified\u201d by Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. Speaking to the Press Association about his speech earlier today, backing a second referendum on Brexit, the former Tory chairman said Thatcher would have opposed May\u2019s Brexit deal because it gives too much power to the remaining 27 EU states. He said: I think Margaret Thatcher would have been horrified at the idea that we should negotiate things that are really going to matter to our future in circumstances in which 27 EU member states each have a right to veto what we want to do. Because from the end of March onwards, if we go out on Mrs May\u2019s terms every member state has a veto on what we want. At the moment, things have to be decided by a qualified majority, but after the end of March it\u2019s a vote for everybody. Patten was referring to the fact that, under May\u2019s proposals, the UK would leave the EU on 29 March and then negotiate a future trade deal. That deal will have to be approved unanimously by the remaining EU states. (By contrast, the EU only needed to agree the withdrawal agreement by a \u201csuper\u201d qualified majority - 72% of states, comprising at least 65% of the population of those states in total - although in practice the withdrawal deal was agreed unanimously.) My colleague Peter Walker has been watching work and pensions questions in the Commons. He has posted these on Twitter. Theresa May is likely to be offered an \u201cexchange of letters\u201d confirming the EU\u2019s intention to conclude trade talks with the UK by 2021, as Brussels seeks to help the prime minister in the run-up to next week\u2019s Commons vote on her deal. As my colleagues Daniel Boffey and Dan Sabbagh report, the correspondence under discussion would flesh out language already included in the withdrawal agreement but it is hoped its clarity could persuade some MPs of the EU\u2019s intention to avoid triggering the Irish backstop. Should talks on a sufficiently comprehensive and deep future trade deal be agreed and ratified by the the start of 2021, it is hoped there would be no need for the whole of the UK to fall into the customs union envisaged by that \u2018all-weather\u2019 solution for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. On a visit to a hospital in Liverpool, May said this about the assurances that she hopes to offer MPs before the vote on her Brexit deal, planned for Tuesday next week. She said: In the coming days, what we will set out is not just about the EU but also about what we can do domestically. So we will be setting out measures which will be specific to Northern Ireland, we will be setting out proposals for a greater role for Parliament as we move into the next stage of the negotiation and we are continuing to work on further assurances on further undertakings from the European Union in relation to the concern that has been expressed by parliamentarians. At the Number 10 lobby briefing the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said further details of the debate would be revealed in due course. It is not yet clear whether MPs will resume the debate they were having in December, or whether they will start a new debate on a revised motion; whether or not May will open it on Wednesday; and whether or not MPs will sit on Friday. Jeremy Corbyn has been granted a Commons urgent question about the Brexit deal. (See 12.23pm.) He wants May to reply in person, but it has not yet been confirmed whether she will, or whether she will send another minister to reply on her behalf. Germany\u2019s foreign affairs minister is to fly to Dublin on Tuesday for Brexit talks as relations with Ireland intensify in an attempt to find a \u201cfix\u201d that will help May get the EU withdrawal agreement ratified. May is to chair a powerful new Cabinet committee overseeing the government\u2019s Brexit preparations, Downing Street has said. As the Press Association reports, the EU exit and trade (preparedness) committee will replace the existing EU XT committee while taking on the Brexit functions of the national security council under Operation Yellowhammer. It will also take over the work of the inter-ministerial groups (IMGs) on EU exit and borders, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said. He told the lobby briefing: The intention is to streamline the process to oversee the delivery of plans for an orderly exit from the EU. The IMGs were not previously decision-making bodies so this brings this together in an orderly and coherent manner. The 21-member committee will include secretaries of state for the Whitehall departments directly involved in Brexit planning as well as the chief whip Julian Smith and the attorney general Geoffrey Cox. Its remit will include contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit, engagement with Brussels and EU member states on no-deal readiness and the provision of \u201cclear direction and co-ordination across HMG\u201d. May has been criticised for saying that Brexit will help to pay for the planned extra \u00a320.5bn being allocated to the NHS. In her speech at the Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool, she said: Over the next five years \u2013 the NHS England budget will increase by \u00a320.5bn in real terms compared to today. This commitment is possible because of our strong public finances, and because as we leave the EU and take back control of our money, we will no longer be sending vast annual sums to Brussels. This claim is contentious because, even though Brexit will generate a direct saving for the government, because it will not have to pay contributions to the EU, allowing money to go to the NHS instead, most economists think this will not compensate for the indirect losses that Brexit will generate, because tax revenues will be lower. As a recent Commons library briefing paper (pdf) puts it: In summary, the overall net impact on the public finances from Brexit will likely be determined by the wider impact on the economy rather than the direct savings from EU budget contributions. But May refused to accept this point when challenged at her Q&amp;A. When the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg questioned the validity of her claim, May replied: On that claim it\u2019s very simple: we currently spend significant sums of money to the EU every year, in future that money will be available for us to spend on our priorities and clearly, as I have set out, the NHS is our key spending priority. The People\u2019s Vote campaign said the claim that Brexit would help the NHS was a fib. (See 12.37pm.) Downing Street has dismissed Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that a no-deal Brexit is \u201cclosest to what people actually voted for\u201d in 2016. (See 9.24am.) Asked about this, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said that Johnson himself said that the UK should have relationship with the EU \u201cbased on trade and cooperation\u201d during the referendum campaign. A live rehearsal of an emergency traffic system that will be put in place to prevent congestion in Dover in the event of a no-deal Brexit has been described as \u201ca waste of time\u201d by drivers participating in the test in Kent. A \u201ctougher and faster\u201d set of waiting-time standards is needed for some patients attending accident and emergency departments, Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, has said. Two of the main anti-Brexit groups have put out press notices claiming there was something inappropriate about Theresa May defending her Brexit plans on a visit to Alder Hey children\u2019s hospital in Liverpool this morning. Best for Britain says 13% of the hospital\u2019s doctors are EU nationals (or non-British EU nationals, to be precise). It has released this comment from the Labour MP Alison McGovern. As May parades her NHS 10-year plan at Alder Hey hospital, our health service is facing the greatest threat to its existence. World-class children\u2019s hospitals like Alder Hey are held together by the dedication and expertise of EU staff, who we cannot afford to lose due to Brexit. And the People\u2019s Vote campaign says the hospital was built with \u00a356m in funding from the European Investment Bank. It released this comment from the Labour MP Luciana Berger. It is beyond parody that the prime minister has the audacity to claim that Brexit benefits our NHS [see 12.13pm], standing in a hospital that was built using over \u00a350m of financing available to the UK because of our EU membership. Access to this funding is vital. NHS trusts across the country rely on European investment in order to build the health facilities we need. The government willingly cutting off access to this \u2013 especially with absolutely no plan for how to replicate it \u2013 amounts to a dereliction of duty. This is further proof that Brexit means less money for our NHS, not more. The fibs people were told during the referendum in 2016 are proven wrong every day. This is why we need a People\u2019s Vote. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has said that Brexit has \u201cmaterially strengthened\u201d the case for Scottish independence. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Good Morning Scotland, she said: Everything that has happened over the past couple of years, from Scotland facing exit from the EU against our will to every reasonable attempt at compromise to protect Scotland\u2019s interests by the Scottish government being spurned, to the powers of the Scottish parliament being eroded, to the UK government even taking the Scottish government to court, all of that has strengthened and reinforced the case for Scotland to be independent, because these are not just academic arguments, all of this will have a material impact on Scotland\u2019s economy and well-being for decades to come ... The case for independence is materially strengthened from an already strong base in 2014 ... We were told in 2014 that it was voting for independence that would put in peril our membership of the European Union. Because we didn\u2019t vote for independence, we now not just find ourselves facing exit, the voice and the interests of Scotland are being completely ignored and sidelined. At a briefing in Brussels earlier Margaritis Schinas, the spokesman for the European commission, said Theresa May will speak again with European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker later this week. He said the pair had a \u201cfriendly conversation\u201d by telephone on Friday and \u201cwill be talking again this week\u201d. But Schinas said that there are no negotiation meetings scheduled this week because the negotiations are over. He explained: There is no negotiation because everything on the table has been established as approved, established, achieved. The priority now is to await events, monitor what is happening [with] the ratification procedure on the UK side and no, there will not be any meeting between the commission and our negotiator teams. Schinas went on to say that the commission would continue with preparations for a no-deal Brexit and \u201cmonitor the need for additional action\u201d. Earlier I mentioned the \u201cCommon Market 2.0\u201d report from Lucy Powell and Robert Halfon, advocating a Norway plus Brexit. (See 10.58am.) But the link I included was not correct. Here is the correct one. Brompton Bicycle has built up a \u00a31m stockpile of bike parts including wheel rims, spokes and steel, to guarantee supplies for its west London factory in case of a hard Brexit, my colleague Sarah Butler reports. This is from my colleague Dan Sabbagh. There are three ministerial statements in the Commons this afternoon. And before they start, we\u2019ve got two urgent questions. Jeremy Corbyn has tabled an urgent question for Theresa May, but that does not mean that May will respond in person. Number 10 can send whoever they want. We are more likely to get David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, or Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, responding for the government. Asked how she would like to see the NHS become more efficient, May says 30% of patients who are in hospital do not need to be in a hospital. Addressing this would save money, she says. She also says she was impressed to learn that at Alder Hey they have a chef on every ward. That means patients are fed much more effectively, she says. The Q&amp;A is now over. (I\u2019m afraid I missed some of the answers, because the wifi crashed, but the answers were fairly routine.) May is now taking questions. Q: [From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg] There are people protesting outside saying the NHS would suffer if you don\u2019t get a Brexit deal. What evidence is there to suggest that you can get your deal through parliament? And isn\u2019t it misleading to keep claiming that leaving the EU will free up money for the NHS? May says it is clear that leaving the EU will free up funds for the NHS. She says there was \u201cfurther movement\u201d from EU leaders at their December summit. She has been speaking to them again over the holidays. She wants to set out in the coming measures relating to Northern Ireland, to parliament and to the EU that could provide more assurance to MPs. May says the NHS needs to exploit the opportunities offered by new technology. She says the NHS budget will increase by \u00a320.5bn in real terms, compared with today. The NHS is the public\u2019s priority. So she has made it her number one spending priority, she says. She says she asked NHS England to draw up a plan for the future, focused on cutting waste. The five-year funding settlement, and 10-year plan for the NHS, set out a path for the future, she says. Theresa May is speaking now at Alder Hey children\u2019s hospital in Liverpool. She is promoting the long-term plan for the NHS launched today. Here is a summary of what is in it, from my colleague Denis Campbell, based on what was briefed about it yesterday. I\u2019m just back from the Downing Street lobby briefing. And here is the top line. Theresa May is going to chair a new cabinet committee that has been set up to take charge of Brexit planning. It will be called the EU exit and trade (preparedness) committee and it will take over some Brexit planning responsibilities from another cabinet committee and from the national security council. Among other issues, it will cover planning for a no-deal Brexit. Most members of the cabinet will sit on it, and it will meet for the first time later this week. I will post more from the briefing soon. The Conservative MP Robert Halfon and the Labour MP Lucy Powell have published a report (pdf) making the case for what is normally called \u201cNorway plus\u201d - a Brexit that would involve staying in the single market and the customs union. But they call it \u201ccommon market 2.0\u201d. They say: The report we are publishing together makes the case for a Brexit that delivers on the result of the 2016 referendum while protecting the economic interests of working people across the UK. Common market 2.0 offers Theresa May a last chance at a Brexit deal that can command a cross-party majority. Common market 2.0 is also the only deal that meets Labour\u2019s six tests by delivering on Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s call for a customs union and a strong single market deal. Common market 2.0 is the only sensible, common sense Brexit deal that can work. I\u2019m off to the lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am. The Labour party is saying that Theresa May should come to the Commons to make a statement to MPs this afternoon about progress in the Brexit talks over Christmas. Given that there has not really been very much progress, as May more or less admitted herself in her Andrew Marr interview yesterday (referring to the extra assurances she wants from the EU, she said \u201cand we are still working on this\u201d), Labour is being optimistic. According to the Times, May is planning to update MPs on Wednesday. That may take the form of her opening the Brexit debate, although that has not yet been confirmed. With Boris Johnson making the case for a no-deal Brexit (see 9.24am), the pro-Brexit thinktank Global Britain and Labour Leave have published a joint report (pdf) spelling out that they say are \u201c30 truths\u201d about this option. Rather than \u201cno deal\u201d, it should be called \u201cWTO +++\u201d, they say. The report has been jointly written by Peter Lilley, the Conservative former trade secretary, and Brendan Chilton, general secretary of Labour Leave. David Henig, the trade expert and former civil servant who now heads the UK Trade Policy Project, has been factchecking the claims. He reckons that only around a quarter are wholly true. A \u201ctougher and faster\u201d set of waiting-time standards is needed for some patients attending accident and emergency departments, Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, has said. My colleague Sarah Marsh has the full story here. My colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll is covering the no-deal Brexit traffic congestion drill at Dover this morning. Here is her story. And here is one of her tweets. The Independent\u2019s parliamentary sketchwriter, Tom Peck, has also been sent out to cover all the drama. His Twitter thread on his assignment is a joy to read. It starts here. Good morning. And happy new year to everyone. Or maybe not. We\u2019ll see. On the Brexit front, we\u2019re in much the same position that we were before Christmas, with Theresa May insisting that MPs should vote for her deal but all the evidence suggesting that the Commons will reject it by a huge margin. But we have, this morning, got a firm date for the vote (assuming it does not get postponed for the second time). As the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith reports, government sources are saying it will take place a week tomorrow. And, if anything, opposition to May\u2019s plan in Conservative circles is firming up. There is some evidence of this in the Daily Telegraph this morning, where Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, has used his regular column (paywall) to claim that a no-deal Brexit is \u201cclosest to what people actually voted for\u201d. Time and again the Brexit debate turns into a tribute to the wisdom of the British people \u2013 and their instinctive ability to sort fact from nonsense. Over the last few weeks, they have been bombarded with warnings of what could happen to this country in the event of a \u201cno-deal Brexit\u201d \u2013 otherwise known as coming out on World Trade terms. Whether prompted by No 10 or not, establishment figures have taken to the airwaves to warn of the perils of rejecting Theresa May\u2019s lamentable Withdrawal Agreement; and we now have a cumulative forecast that is downright apocalyptic ... For weeks the public have been regaled with this stuff \u2013 and yet an astonishing thing has happened: the grimmer the warnings, and the more systematic the efforts to make their flesh creep, the greater has been their indifference and their resolve. Of all the options suggested by pollsters \u2013 staying in the EU, coming out on Theresa May\u2019s terms, or coming out on World Trade terms \u2013 it is the last, the so-called no-deal option, that is gaining in popularity. In spite of \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 everything they have been told, it is this future that is by some margin preferred by the British public. What is going on? What is it that gives so many of the electorate the confidence to dismiss these prognostications? The most obvious answer, perhaps, is that this option is closest to what people actually voted for. When 17.4 million chose to leave the EU, they didn\u2019t vote to stay locked in the customs union or the single market. There was no suggestion that we would pay \u00a339 billion for nothing, without even a sniff of a trade deal with Brussels. Like many of Johnson\u2019s Brexit assertions, this is, even on the most generous of assessments, questionable. Trading with the EU on WTO terms would involve tariffs. But readers will remember Johnson and Vote Leave assuring the country in 2016 that Brexit would never come to that because trade barriers of that kind would be unacceptable to German BMW manufacturers and Italian prosecco producers. It is also interesting to note that Johnson seems to be giving up on the \u201cSuperCanada\u201d Brexit plan he used to champion. Canada does not get a mention in his article today. Here is the agenda for the day. Early morning: The Department of Transport is carrying out a live trial of an emergency traffic congestion system to be used in Dover in the event of a no-deal Brexit, with 79 lorry drivers participating. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 11.30am: Lord Patten, the former Conservative cabinet minister, and Sam Gyimah, the former universities minister, speak at a People\u2019s Vote event. Patten will declare his support for a second referendum. Late morning: Theresa May visits a hospital to publicise the government\u2019s new long-term plan for the NHS. 2.30pm: Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 3.30pm: Urgent questions and ministerial statements. With MPs back today from their Christmas recess, we are likely to get several of these, on topics like no-deal Brexit planning and migrants crossing the Channel. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up, at around 6pm. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Which, bless, is so retro it doesn\u2019t even get a neologism. And even Brexit got one of those. For the women who have been unwittingly celebrating Januhairy since the moment they caught a glimpse of their leg hair in the wintry split-second between removal of jeans and pulling-on of pyjama bottoms and thought: \u201cFuck it\u201d \u2026 well done. You are ahead of the curve. And probably someone who, like me, reacts to any month-long initiative that is ostensibly designed to improve us, but often results in more shame, in much the same way as misogynists react to a woman with hairy legs. My overall response to Januhairy is \u2026 bristly. On the one hand, good for Laura Jackson, the Exeter University student who started the campaign. Just like the hair that never stops growing, this work is never done. We live in a world where a razor advert depicting a woman removing body hair makes the news. It feels ridiculous to say so (pesky internalised misogyny), but it takes genuine guts to go out in summer with bare legs as hairy as mine get. On the other hand, this isn\u2019t exactly a taboo that\u2019s being busted when we\u2019re still illustrating it with that image of Julia Roberts\u2019 hairy pit from the 90s.

The next polls are scheduled for 2020. Last time, not one opposition MP was elected. Mr Abiy\u2019s overtures to Eritrea led to the end of a long-running conflict. He oversaw the meeting of South Sudanese leaders that produced a fragile but desperately needed peace deal. This \u2013 along with Eritrea\u2019s ensuing rapprochement with Somalia and Djibouti \u2013 led the UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres to speak of \u201ca wind of hope blowing in the Horn of Africa\u201d.</p> <p>Yet Ethiopia has seen an alarming rise in multi-faceted <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-ethnic-violence-is-destabilising-ethiopias-reform-gains-103928\" title=\"\">ethnic violence</a>. Over a million citizens were displaced last year. State controls have loosened in a country with entrenched divisions and rivalries: the EPRDF has heavily promoted ethnic identity as the basis for mobilisation, including through the complex system of ethnic federalism it introduced. Some fear the security apparatus does not know how to tackle clashes by any means other than the old, brutal methods. This autumn, following criticism over its handling of unrest, the government detained over a thousand in military camps for <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/10/20/mass-arrests-brainwashing-threaten-ethiopias-reform-agenda\" title=\"\">\u201crehabilitation\u201d</a>. There are fears Mr Abiy\u2019s plans for overhauling the economy, including <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-investment/ethiopias-pm-abiy-sets-up-team-to-advise-on-privatization-idUKKBN1KP06M\" title=\"\">privatising state enterprises</a>, may enrich some but hinder progress on poverty reduction. Any perception some are profiting from the sell-off of state assets could be inflammatory.</p> <p>Too much rests upon Mr Abiy at present. One concern is that charismatic leadership can slide into unchecked personal power. Another is that any leader seeking change must battle powerful interests. The EPRDF is riven by competition between its four ethnically based parties and institutional and personal rivalries. The chair of the Tigray party recently accused Mr Abiy of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.africanews.com/2018/11/20/tigray-chair-says-ethiopia-pm-conducting-political-and-ethnic-witch-hunt/\" title=\"\">seeking to bring Tigrayan people to their knees</a>\u201d. His premiership has seen a grenade attack on one of his rallies and the arrival of angry soldiers at his office; <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-45903244\" title=\"\">he says</a> they wanted to kill him. His defusal of that situation hinted at his adroitness; his background in the military has also surely been useful to him. Given that the EPRDF had until last year been Tigray-dominated, his rise as an Oromo (with an Amhara mother), reflects his skills as a politician as well as the Oromo protests which triggered <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-43073285\" title=\"\">his predecessor\u2019s resignation</a>.</p> <p>But with only a year until elections are due, there is still no proper political roadmap from the government. Swift progress is needed in reforming repressive laws. Some would like to see a new constitution <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/opinion/ethiopia-abiy-ahmed-reforms-ethnic-conflict-ethnic-federalism.html\" title=\"\">dismantling ethnic federalism</a>, though most suspect prudence will restrain Mr Abiy from such a wholesale change. His record to date is unquestionably impressive. But the developments he has set in train in Africa\u2019s second most populous nation can only be secured by institutions.</p>",

State controls have loosened in a country with entrenched divisions and rivalries: the EPRDF has heavily promoted ethnic identity as the basis for mobilisation, including through the complex system of ethnic federalism it introduced. Some fear the security apparatus does not know how to tackle clashes by any means other than the old, brutal methods. This autumn, following criticism over its handling of unrest, the government detained over a thousand in military camps for \u201crehabilitation\u201d. There are fears Mr Abiy\u2019s plans for overhauling the economy, including privatising state enterprises, may enrich some but hinder progress on poverty reduction. Any perception some are profiting from the sell-off of state assets could be inflammatory. Too much rests upon Mr Abiy at present. One concern is that charismatic leadership can slide into unchecked personal power. Another is that any leader seeking change must battle powerful interests. The EPRDF is riven by competition between its four ethnically based parties and institutional and personal rivalries. The chair of the Tigray party recently accused Mr Abiy of \u201cseeking to bring Tigrayan people to their knees\u201d. His premiership has seen a grenade attack on one of his rallies and the arrival of angry soldiers at his office; he says they wanted to kill him. His defusal of that situation hinted at his adroitness; his background in the military has also surely been useful to him. Given that the EPRDF had until last year been Tigray-dominated, his rise as an Oromo (with an Amhara mother), reflects his skills as a politician as well as the Oromo protests which triggered his predecessor\u2019s resignation. But with only a year until elections are due, there is still no proper political roadmap from the government. Swift progress is needed in reforming repressive laws. Some would like to see a new constitution dismantling ethnic federalism, though most suspect prudence will restrain Mr Abiy from such a wholesale change. His record to date is unquestionably impressive. But the developments he has set in train in Africa\u2019s second most populous nation can only be secured by institutions.",

A coastguard search had been launched off the Kent coast on Monday when the empty vessel was found on the beach at Dungeness shortly after 8am, but was stood down after it became clear no one had been left stranded in the sea. Hours later, police and Border Force personnel were seen three and a-half miles away in the town of Lydd with some of the men, who were offered foil blankets to keep warm. The Home Office said a ninth man, who was also found in the area, was arrested on suspicion of facilitating illegal entry to the UK. It added that seven of the men were in Border Force care and the eighth had been taken to hospital. The development comes after a focus has fallen on recent channel crossings using small boats. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, last month declared the rising number of people attempting to cross the Channel to be a major incident and announced plans to move two Border Force cutters to take part in search and patrol operations. The navy vessel HMS Mersey, which was on patrol on Monday morning, is being used to guard the Channel until the cutters return. The rigid-hulled dinghy in which the men had travelled was discovered on a remote beach at Dungeness on Romney Marsh, Kent, with life jackets and fuel inside. While armed police and Border Force personnel were in attendance, The south-east coast ambulance service said it was called to Dungeness Road at 12:20 GMT after \u201creports a number of people needed medical assessment having come off a boat\u201d. A Home Office spokesman said: \u201cBorder Force was contacted by HM Coastguard this morning, Monday 7 January, at around 8.20am after they received reports of an unattended RHIB (rigid-hulled inflatable boat) at Dungeness, Kent. \u201cBorder Force officers were deployed to secure the vessel.

The Road Haulage Association said the dry run of a contingency traffic plan for the port was \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d. The location for the Department for Transport\u2019s trial was a disused airport north of the Kent port that was once used to test the bouncing bombs employed in the Dambuster raids in the second world war.

From there they were directed en masse to Dover, Britain\u2019s biggest roll-on-roll-off port that handles about 10,000 lorries a day. After the first dry run drivers said while it was good the government was doing something the exercise was so small it was pointless. \u201cIt\u2019s a waste of time.

Brexiters in favour of no deal say there will be no checks at Dover if the UK crashes out of the EU, but French authorities have warned that 100% of food and livestock has to be checked at special border inspection posts. The Calais politician Xavier Bertrand has said a two-minute delay would lead to a 27,000-strong queue on both sides of the channel. And the Road Haulage Association has said the documentation required if the UK leaves the single market is so impractical it would take eight hours per truck to complete. The challenge facing the government and Kent county council was evident at dawn as an argument broke out between marshals about where the trucks were supposed to go. The association described the test as \u201cwindow dressing\u201d, saying it could not possibly mimic the reality of 6,000 trucks that would be held at Manston airport in the event of no deal. \u201cThis is designed to test what happens if there is no deal and Operation Brock is implemented,\u201d said a spokesman referring to the codename for the Brexit traffic management plan. Kent county council has warned a no-deal Brexit could cause major disruption across Kent, with gridlock on the roads around Dover. Rod McKenzie, the managing director of policy for the Road Haulage Association, said the rehearsal was too limited in scope. \u201cCritics might call it window dressing,\u201d he said. \u201cWith 89 trucks, in no way can it replicate a potential 6,000 trucks that might need to be held in or around Kent and Manston.

Yet later it is implied that only the refounding of Vaughan College, following its closure by the University of Leicester, will continue to provide access to higher education for adults in the city. This ignores the 700 students, all adults, almost all from the local community, currently studying on access courses and for foundation degrees, HNCs and HNDs at Leicester College.

      "body": "<p>Cast your minds back to last year when everyone went a bit mad. Spoilt for choice? OK, then: to a few weeks ago when a window-fitter and his wife, whose friends said they had \u201cno interest in drones or flying\u201d, were thought to be responsible for causing Gatwick airport to be shut down. Their house was searched and they were taken away. Paul Gait\u2019s boss said he was working with him at the time, but no matter. The droning expert, Piers Morgan, weighed in, calling the couple \u201cclowns\u201d. They were released without charge.</p> <p>\u201cHow can you all come to a standstill because of a toy helicopter?\u201d an American friend asked me during those three days of chaos. I didn\u2019t know, but because I had seen a diagram in a newspaper explaining why drones couldn\u2019t be shot down, I just said it was complicated. I saw a video of a dot in the sky, which could have been a black swan. There was some boasting about the Drone Dome systems that defeat Isis, but mostly people were in bits because they couldn\u2019t get to Disneyland.</p> <p>No one seemed to have a grip on what was happening. At one point, a senior police officer cast doubt on the sightings by claiming that police had no footage. Maybe some of the drone sightings were of police drones looking for bad drones? As the officer put it: \u201cWe are working with human beings saying they have seen something.\u201d But a conference call featuring the dependably incompetent Chris Grayling and Sajid Javid agreed that the 67 drone sightings were \u201clegitimate\u201d, and the officer\u2019s remarks were written off as \u201cpoor communication\u201d. A thousand flights were cancelled but there seem to be no pictures, no suspects, no traces of radio signals.</p> <p>Was this all a mass delusion, I wonder? Who remembers 2016\u2019s mass sightings of evil clowns in the US and the UK? I do, because I love stuff like this. There is no evidence that most of them occurred. Owning our own delusions is indeed tough. Make those in charge sort it out!</p> <p>In coming weeks, the future of the UK may or may not be decided by those who are in government but without power. Chaos could ensue. Or everything may remain much the same. No one really knows. The drone saga is a premonition of turmoil thrown up by an anxious culture. Am I saying Brexit is mass delusion? Well, it\u2019s certainly a series of competing fantasies. As I watched Barry Gardiner explain how Labour would get a trade agreement with each member of the EU, he might as well have been talking about evil clowns or an Israeli Drone Dome. May, on the other hand, threatens us with \u201cuncharted territory\u201d. This is where we have lived for two years. Brexit, driven by feelings and economic irrationality, cannot be contested with a series of new \u201cfacts\u201d , a kind of \u201csnap-out-of-it\u201d approach to disturbed behaviour.</p> <p>Hysteria can be defined as ungovernable emotional excess. This is as good a description of the state of the nation as any other. Paralysis was a common symptom of hysteria in Freud\u2019s heyday. Now an airport shuts down; our systems cannot cope or even recognise what is real any more. Apparently we are going to be hit by some actual reality soon. Seriously? It makes me wonder if the past two years happened at all.</p> <p>\u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist</p>",

I didn\u2019t know, but because I had seen a diagram in a newspaper explaining why drones couldn\u2019t be shot down, I just said it was complicated. I saw a video of a dot in the sky, which could have been a black swan. There was some boasting about the Drone Dome systems that defeat Isis, but mostly people were in bits because they couldn\u2019t get to Disneyland. No one seemed to have a grip on what was happening. At one point, a senior police officer cast doubt on the sightings by claiming that police had no footage. Maybe some of the drone sightings were of police drones looking for bad drones? As the officer put it: \u201cWe are working with human beings saying they have seen something.\u201d But a conference call featuring the dependably incompetent Chris Grayling and Sajid Javid agreed that the 67 drone sightings were \u201clegitimate\u201d, and the officer\u2019s remarks were written off as \u201cpoor communication\u201d. A thousand flights were cancelled but there seem to be no pictures, no suspects, no traces of radio signals. Was this all a mass delusion, I wonder? Who remembers 2016\u2019s mass sightings of evil clowns in the US and the UK? I do, because I love stuff like this. There is no evidence that most of them occurred. Owning our own delusions is indeed tough. Make those in charge sort it out! In coming weeks, the future of the UK may or may not be decided by those who are in government but without power. Chaos could ensue. Or everything may remain much the same. No one really knows. The drone saga is a premonition of turmoil thrown up by an anxious culture. Am I saying Brexit is mass delusion? Well, it\u2019s certainly a series of competing fantasies. As I watched Barry Gardiner explain how Labour would get a trade agreement with each member of the EU, he might as well have been talking about evil clowns or an Israeli Drone Dome. May, on the other hand, threatens us with \u201cuncharted territory\u201d. This is where we have lived for two years. Brexit, driven by feelings and economic irrationality, cannot be contested with a series of new \u201cfacts\u201d , a kind of \u201csnap-out-of-it\u201d approach to disturbed behaviour. Hysteria can be defined as ungovernable emotional excess. This is as good a description of the state of the nation as any other. Paralysis was a common symptom of hysteria in Freud\u2019s heyday. Now an airport shuts down; our systems cannot cope or even recognise what is real any more. Apparently we are going to be hit by some actual reality soon. Seriously? It makes me wonder if the past two years happened at all. \u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist",

The Guardian understands a range of related issues will also be discussed, including cutting the length of the tournament to assist player welfare.</p> <p>Against a backdrop of uncertain economic forecasts, the recent sizeable private equity investment in English club rugby and the assorted different priorities of unions across Europe, all stakeholders will be asked to confirm their desire to remain in the tournament before June 2020 when, technically, a participant has the right to give two years\u2019 notice should it wish to leave.</p> <p>As thing stand, European officials say there is no imminent danger of the competition ending but with talks ongoing about easing the congested global fixture list and the Guinness Pro14 now featuring clubs from South Africa the landscape is an increasingly volatile one and the Champions Cup\u2019s existing television and sponsorship deals are due to expire in three years\u2019 time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jan/07/rugby-union-talking-points-from-the-premierships-weekend-action\">Rugby union: talking points from the Premiership\u2019s weekend action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>European club rugby\u2019s flagship tournament has been among the biggest success stories of the professional era since it was launched in 1995-96 and this season\u2019s final in Newcastle in May is already a sell-out. With increasing calls for top players to play fewer matches, however, it is understood that a proposal to cut the number of European weekends from nine to seven or eight is set to be aired.</p> <p>One possibility is for the pool stages to be reduced from six to four matches per team, with the semi-finals possibly being played over two home and away legs as happens in football. This might well involve reducing the number of competing teams from 20 to 16, which would not go down well among those potentially excluded.</p> <p>Whatever happens Simon Halliday, chairman of European Professional Club Rugby, is among those who firmly believe that safeguarding player welfare is crucial to the game\u2019s future. \u201cIf we\u2019re only going to pay lip service to player welfare, we don\u2019t deserve to have a leadership position in our sport,\u201d said Halliday, uncomfortably aware that next season\u2019s cup is due to start 12 days after the World Cup final.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/20/rugby-union-limbo-no-deal-brexit-the-breakdown\">The Breakdown | Rugby union in limbo over prospect of no-deal Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The former Bath, Harlequins and England centre is equally keen to ensure the tournament retains its lustre. \u201cThere is no longer term as we currently sit here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe facts are that everything \u2013 the heads of agreement, television and sponsorship revenues \u2013 is due to unwind at the same time in 2022. Theoretically at the end of the 2020 season people can declare their wish to continue or not. I think the competition is absolutely safe but you can\u2019t sleepwalk into the next cycle. That\u2019s just irresponsible.\u201d</p> <p>EPCR is also keeping a close eye on Brexit developments, with the United Kingdom due to leave the European Union on 29 March, the same weekend as the European quarter-finals are scheduled.

      "bodyText": "Crucial talks on the future of European club rugby are about to commence with Heineken Champions Cup organisers seeking assurances that all parties are fully committed to the tournament beyond 2022. The Guardian understands a range of related issues will also be discussed, including cutting the length of the tournament to assist player welfare. Against a backdrop of uncertain economic forecasts, the recent sizeable private equity investment in English club rugby and the assorted different priorities of unions across Europe, all stakeholders will be asked to confirm their desire to remain in the tournament before June 2020 when, technically, a participant has the right to give two years\u2019 notice should it wish to leave. As thing stand, European officials say there is no imminent danger of the competition ending but with talks ongoing about easing the congested global fixture list and the Guinness Pro14 now featuring clubs from South Africa the landscape is an increasingly volatile one and the Champions Cup\u2019s existing television and sponsorship deals are due to expire in three years\u2019 time. European club rugby\u2019s flagship tournament has been among the biggest success stories of the professional era since it was launched in 1995-96 and this season\u2019s final in Newcastle in May is already a sell-out. With increasing calls for top players to play fewer matches, however, it is understood that a proposal to cut the number of European weekends from nine to seven or eight is set to be aired. One possibility is for the pool stages to be reduced from six to four matches per team, with the semi-finals possibly being played over two home and away legs as happens in football. This might well involve reducing the number of competing teams from 20 to 16, which would not go down well among those potentially excluded. Whatever happens Simon Halliday, chairman of European Professional Club Rugby, is among those who firmly believe that safeguarding player welfare is crucial to the game\u2019s future. \u201cIf we\u2019re only going to pay lip service to player welfare, we don\u2019t deserve to have a leadership position in our sport,\u201d said Halliday, uncomfortably aware that next season\u2019s cup is due to start 12 days after the World Cup final. The former Bath, Harlequins and England centre is equally keen to ensure the tournament retains its lustre. \u201cThere is no longer term as we currently sit here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe facts are that everything \u2013 the heads of agreement, television and sponsorship revenues \u2013 is due to unwind at the same time in 2022. Theoretically at the end of the 2020 season people can declare their wish to continue or not. I think the competition is absolutely safe but you can\u2019t sleepwalk into the next cycle. That\u2019s just irresponsible.\u201d EPCR is also keeping a close eye on Brexit developments, with the United Kingdom due to leave the European Union on 29 March, the same weekend as the European quarter-finals are scheduled. In the event of widespread travel disruption, there would be numerous potential issues for fans, players and officials to overcome. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a board meeting within the next month and it\u2019ll be on the agenda but I would like to think there will be an outbreak of commonsense,\u201d said Halliday. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone sees an Armageddon scenario. I think the practicalities will win out eventually because I don\u2019t believe anyone, least of all the EU, are going to want to create chaos.\u201d Sale have confirmed the signing of the Wasps tighthead prop Jake Cooper-Woolley. The 29-year-old will join the Sharks on a three-year deal this summer after six years with Wasps. \u201cSale looks like a great opportunity for me to challenge myself in a new environment,\u201d said Cooper-Woolley. \u201cThe club are on the up and hopefully I can play a big part in them having a successful future both domestically and in Europe.\u201d",

The book won that year\u2019s Kate Greenaway medal, and its success launched a career that spanned six decades and more than 60 books.</p> <p>There are many highlights, but the second Greenaway medal winner, Mr Gumpy\u2019s Outing, in 1970, stands out as a brilliant and highly influential example of cumulative graphic storytelling. Other much-loved titles include Avocado Baby (1982), Oi! Get Off Our Train (1989) and Granpa (1984), the last of which which won the Kurt Maschler award in 1984 and was adapted into an animated film in 1989. Burningham also illustrated with distinction Ian Fleming\u2019s Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in 1964 and Kenneth Grahame\u2019s The Wind in the Willows in 1983.</p> <p>In creating what might be termed (in Sendak\u2019s words) \u201cvisual poetry\u201d, Burningham constantly pushed at the boundaries of how much could be left unsaid, always treating the reader\u2019s imagination with the utmost respect, whatever that reader\u2019s age might be. In his books, the space between pictorial and verbal information is often large, inviting the reader to fill in the gaps. These brazen narrative ambiguities fly in the face of the traditional advice to creators of children\u2019s books that all loose ends must be firmly tied up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe1f5019b889aadf626280df65dc6e3219605ff9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe1f5019b889aadf626280df65dc6e3219605ff9/0_1_3652_2191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mr Gumpy\u2019s Outing, 1970, is a brilliant and highly influential example of cumulative graphic storytelling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mr Gumpy\u2019s Outing, 1970, is a brilliant and highly influential example of cumulative graphic storytelling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In contrast to many of his contemporaries, such as Charles Keeping, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/09/brian-wildsmith-obituary\" title=\"\">Brian Wildsmith</a> and Raymond Briggs, Burningham was not by any means a gifted draughtsman. It may be that the absence of mannerism or stylistic trickery in his drawing was key to the purity of voice that connected with so many readers and led to such widespread appreciation, not only in the UK but also across the globe \u2013 Burningham\u2019s books are especially revered in the far east.</p> <p>He was never a confident speaker or writer in the traditional sense; his genius lay in an ability to communicate in a childlike but never childish visual language and in his understanding of the mutually exclusive worlds of childhood and adulthood.</p> <p>This theme was explicitly explored in Come Away from the Water, Shirley (1977) and in Granpa. In each of these masterly works, the respective internal universes of child and adult are contrasted with consummate graphic and verbal economy.</p> <p>Born in Farnham, Surrey, Burningham spent much of his childhood being moved around a succession of progressive schools that his liberally minded parents Jessie Macintosh and Charles Burningham wanted to try out. His father had fought in the trenches in the first world war but was registered as a conscientious objector at the outbreak of the second world war in 1939.</p> <p>The family let out their house in Farnham and during the war years travelled the country in a caravan, setting up in remote rural spots in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Yorkshire, where his father would find work and John and his older sisters, Margaret and Elspeth, would be sent to the local schools.</p> <p>While Burningham recalled with fondness the idyllic freedom of a childhood seemingly spent mostly in trees, he was hopelessly disadvantaged academically, with his arrival at each new school seeming to involve grappling with a whole new system of learning. At the age of 13 some stability arrived when he was sent to AS Neill\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.summerhillschool.co.uk/asneill.php\" title=\"\">Summerhill</a> in Suffolk, the original \u201calternative\u201d boarding school, where he stayed, leaving with a school certificate in English literature but having failed the art exam.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c074016cee64a60e30f46c756ef411d3fe69fa61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c074016cee64a60e30f46c756ef411d3fe69fa61/0_313_3248_1949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Granpa, 1984, won that year\u2019s Kurt Maschler award and was adapted into an animated film in 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Granpa, 1984, won that year\u2019s Kurt Maschler award and was adapted into an animated film in 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: John Burningham</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/07/john-burningham-childrens-author-and-illustrator-dies-aged-82\">John Burningham, children's author and illustrator, dies aged 82</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After two and a half years of non-military service as a conscientious objector, involving heavy labour on forestry and housing projects, Burningham bumped into a former Summerhill school friend on Waterloo Bridge in London, who mentioned that he was studying illustration and graphic design at the Central School of Art. John liked the sound of this and decided to try for a place himself. Despite not having attended the usual prerequisite art foundation course he presented a portfolio of drawings and was accepted.</p> <p>At the Central he was taught by the painter <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/keith-vaughan-2096\" title=\"\">Keith Vaughan</a>, the designer and illustrator <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/laurence-scarfe-1902\" title=\"\">Laurence Scarfe</a> and the textile designer <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/i/professor-bernard-nevill/\" title=\"\">Bernard Nevill</a>. Here he met and later married, in 1964, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/21/helen-oxenbury-life-illustration-motherhood\" title=\"\">Helen Oxenbury</a>. Although Helen was studying theatre design, her own career as an illustrator blossomed too, and she went on to create many award-winning picture books including, with Michael Rosen, We\u2019re Going on a Bear Hunt (1989). Musing on how two artists so successful in the same field managed to stay together for so long, John speculated that the reason must be that each of them always thought of the other as the better artist. </p> <p>Burningham graduated from the Central with distinction in 1959. Contemporaries there included the illustrator John Lawrence, who recalled with great affection Burningham\u2019s wicked sense of humour and the fact that, unusually for the time, he always had transport of one kind or another, initially a Vespa scooter and later a military jeep. \u201cHe was always dashing off somewhere. He would roll up and say \u2018I\u2019m just off to Salisbury Plain, John, do you want to come?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03d1705733bc5f304677bcb90068a56f6d21228c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03d1705733bc5f304677bcb90068a56f6d21228c/0_0_3980_2388/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Avocado Baby, 1982, by John Burningham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Avocado Baby, 1982, by John Burningham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Burningham travelled again after graduating, including a trip back to Israel, where he made puppets for <a href=\"https://www.perthnow.com.au/entertainment/movies/film-producer-yoram-gross-has-died-at-age-88-ng-f2d158d0c33624b3a7212d5d08538ef9\" title=\"\">Yoram Gross</a>\u2019s animation film Joseph the Dreamer (1961). But his first big break came in London shortly afterwards when he was commissioned by Harold Hutchinson, publicity director at London Transport, to produce a number of posters. This was something of a dream commission for a young illustrator, being comparatively well paid, printed to the highest standards of the time and presenting the artist\u2019s work at large scale to a wide audience.</p> <p>This experience of designing bold, graphic, full-colour posters clearly had an impact on the evolution of Burningham\u2019s work in picturebooks. Most illustrators at the time would serve their apprenticeship through commissions for tightly controlled black and white line drawing, graduating to the occasional colour job if lucky.</p> <p>But it was the experience of being told that his work was \u201cposter design rather than book illustration\u201d when hawking his portfolio around that led Burningham to take matters into his own hands and to create a complete picturebook to show to publishers. The book was Borka, and was taken up by Tom Maschler at Jonathan Cape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4e78f33479462298a4cefefa7024b08bf25b0e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4e78f33479462298a4cefefa7024b08bf25b0e1/0_0_2539_3307/768.jpg\" alt=\"Borka: The Adventures of a Goose With No Feathers, 1963.\" width=\"768\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Borka: The Adventures of a Goose With No Feathers, 1963.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: John Burningham</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lawrence and another illustrator, <a href=\"https://www.creativeboom.com/inspiration/john-vernon-lord-named-illustrator-of-the-year-at-the-va-illustration-awards-2018/\" title=\"\">John Vernon Lord</a>, the latter a beneficiary of the brief period that Burningham spent teaching at the Central, recall visiting him in his London flat at the time he was working on Borka. They both recall their amazement at climbing down into the Percy Street basement and seeing the emerging spreads from the book laid out across the floor and Burningham continuing, apparently randomly, to apply bursts of car paint spray and swipes of boot polish to the artworks.</p> <p>This fearless, painterly approach to media was suddenly possible as new developments in printing technology allowed for better reproduction. The richly textured Wildsmith\u2019s ABC had paved the way, winning the Greenaway medal in 1962, and these two artists were at the forefront of a new and vibrant era of picturebooks. Later, Burningham would explore further the possibilities of photographic collage and paint through experimental books such as England (1992), Cloudland (1996) and France (1998).</p> <p>In 2010 Burningham and Oxenbury collaborated for the first time to produce There\u2019s Going to Be a Baby. Last year, they were jointly awarded the BookTrust\u2019s lifetime achievement award, for their outstanding contribution to children\u2019s literature.</p> <p>Helen survives him, along with their son and two daughters, and seven grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 John Mackintosh Burningham, artist, author and illustrator, born 27 April 1936; died 4 January 2019</p>",

Get Off Our Train (1989) and Granpa (1984), the last of which which won the Kurt Maschler award in 1984 and was adapted into an animated film in 1989. Burningham also illustrated with distinction Ian Fleming\u2019s Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in 1964 and Kenneth Grahame\u2019s The Wind in the Willows in 1983. In creating what might be termed (in Sendak\u2019s words) \u201cvisual poetry\u201d, Burningham constantly pushed at the boundaries of how much could be left unsaid, always treating the reader\u2019s imagination with the utmost respect, whatever that reader\u2019s age might be. In his books, the space between pictorial and verbal information is often large, inviting the reader to fill in the gaps. These brazen narrative ambiguities fly in the face of the traditional advice to creators of children\u2019s books that all loose ends must be firmly tied up. In contrast to many of his contemporaries, such as Charles Keeping, Brian Wildsmith and Raymond Briggs, Burningham was not by any means a gifted draughtsman. It may be that the absence of mannerism or stylistic trickery in his drawing was key to the purity of voice that connected with so many readers and led to such widespread appreciation, not only in the UK but also across the globe \u2013 Burningham\u2019s books are especially revered in the far east. He was never a confident speaker or writer in the traditional sense; his genius lay in an ability to communicate in a childlike but never childish visual language and in his understanding of the mutually exclusive worlds of childhood and adulthood. This theme was explicitly explored in Come Away from the Water, Shirley (1977) and in Granpa. In each of these masterly works, the respective internal universes of child and adult are contrasted with consummate graphic and verbal economy. Born in Farnham, Surrey, Burningham spent much of his childhood being moved around a succession of progressive schools that his liberally minded parents Jessie Macintosh and Charles Burningham wanted to try out. His father had fought in the trenches in the first world war but was registered as a conscientious objector at the outbreak of the second world war in 1939. The family let out their house in Farnham and during the war years travelled the country in a caravan, setting up in remote rural spots in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Yorkshire, where his father would find work and John and his older sisters, Margaret and Elspeth, would be sent to the local schools. While Burningham recalled with fondness the idyllic freedom of a childhood seemingly spent mostly in trees, he was hopelessly disadvantaged academically, with his arrival at each new school seeming to involve grappling with a whole new system of learning. At the age of 13 some stability arrived when he was sent to AS Neill\u2019s Summerhill in Suffolk, the original \u201calternative\u201d boarding school, where he stayed, leaving with a school certificate in English literature but having failed the art exam. After two and a half years of non-military service as a conscientious objector, involving heavy labour on forestry and housing projects, Burningham bumped into a former Summerhill school friend on Waterloo Bridge in London, who mentioned that he was studying illustration and graphic design at the Central School of Art. John liked the sound of this and decided to try for a place himself. Despite not having attended the usual prerequisite art foundation course he presented a portfolio of drawings and was accepted. At the Central he was taught by the painter Keith Vaughan, the designer and illustrator Laurence Scarfe and the textile designer Bernard Nevill. Here he met and later married, in 1964, Helen Oxenbury. Although Helen was studying theatre design, her own career as an illustrator blossomed too, and she went on to create many award-winning picture books including, with Michael Rosen, We\u2019re Going on a Bear Hunt (1989). Musing on how two artists so successful in the same field managed to stay together for so long, John speculated that the reason must be that each of them always thought of the other as the better artist. Burningham graduated from the Central with distinction in 1959. Contemporaries there included the illustrator John Lawrence, who recalled with great affection Burningham\u2019s wicked sense of humour and the fact that, unusually for the time, he always had transport of one kind or another, initially a Vespa scooter and later a military jeep. \u201cHe was always dashing off somewhere. He would roll up and say \u2018I\u2019m just off to Salisbury Plain, John, do you want to come?\u2019\u201d Burningham travelled again after graduating, including a trip back to Israel, where he made puppets for Yoram Gross\u2019s animation film Joseph the Dreamer (1961). But his first big break came in London shortly afterwards when he was commissioned by Harold Hutchinson, publicity director at London Transport, to produce a number of posters. This was something of a dream commission for a young illustrator, being comparatively well paid, printed to the highest standards of the time and presenting the artist\u2019s work at large scale to a wide audience. This experience of designing bold, graphic, full-colour posters clearly had an impact on the evolution of Burningham\u2019s work in picturebooks. Most illustrators at the time would serve their apprenticeship through commissions for tightly controlled black and white line drawing, graduating to the occasional colour job if lucky. But it was the experience of being told that his work was \u201cposter design rather than book illustration\u201d when hawking his portfolio around that led Burningham to take matters into his own hands and to create a complete picturebook to show to publishers. The book was Borka, and was taken up by Tom Maschler at Jonathan Cape. Lawrence and another illustrator, John Vernon Lord, the latter a beneficiary of the brief period that Burningham spent teaching at the Central, recall visiting him in his London flat at the time he was working on Borka. They both recall their amazement at climbing down into the Percy Street basement and seeing the emerging spreads from the book laid out across the floor and Burningham continuing, apparently randomly, to apply bursts of car paint spray and swipes of boot polish to the artworks. This fearless, painterly approach to media was suddenly possible as new developments in printing technology allowed for better reproduction. The richly textured Wildsmith\u2019s ABC had paved the way, winning the Greenaway medal in 1962, and these two artists were at the forefront of a new and vibrant era of picturebooks. Later, Burningham would explore further the possibilities of photographic collage and paint through experimental books such as England (1992), Cloudland (1996) and France (1998). In 2010 Burningham and Oxenbury collaborated for the first time to produce There\u2019s Going to Be a Baby. Last year, they were jointly awarded the BookTrust\u2019s lifetime achievement award, for their outstanding contribution to children\u2019s literature. Helen survives him, along with their son and two daughters, and seven grandchildren. \u2022 John Mackintosh Burningham, artist, author and illustrator, born 27 April 1936; died 4 January 2019",

Whereas that last scene </strong><strong>messes with the historical record. It\u2019s not just that it didn\u2019t happen, it</strong><strong> is</strong><strong> laundering </strong><strong>Cummings\u2019 reputation. He is portrayed as a misunderstood man who ran a controversial but legal campaign and is happy to answer questions about what he did. But he isn\u2019t. He\u2019s obfuscated his role and what the campaign did and the illegal methods employed.</strong></p> <p>We are using drama as a public space in a courtroom to drag into it the questions and the answers that are vital for an audience to explore. I don\u2019t agree it\u2019s fucking with the historical record. If it is a creative failing of mine not to make that clear, I will take that on board. It\u2019s certainly not our intention to mislead, and I\u2019m happy for you to set the record straight. It\u2019s why we\u2019re here.</p> <p><strong>I was asked to be a consultant on this film a year ago, but I told the production company it was too soon because there were </strong><strong>major revelations still to come.

I saw this not as a tick list of everything that happened but as a character study of those who made the decisions. <br><br><strong>Part of the problem, I think, is that you\u2019ve written the part of </strong><strong>Cummings so well and Benedict Cumberbatch plays him so </strong><strong>wonderfully. But he also brings baggage to the role. Cummings is a sort of Sherlock character, a </strong><strong>maverick polymath</strong><strong> who brilliantly solves the problems </strong><strong>nobody else can.</strong> <strong>This portrayal makes out that he won through his genius, not by employing criminal methods. And because </strong><strong>the writing and performance are great, this is what will stick in people\u2019s</strong><strong> minds.</strong></p> <p>But what has been interesting about the response so far is how mixed it is to the presentation of Cummings. Some accuse me of demonising him, others of lionising him. Some say he\u2019s presented as a charlatan, some say a genius. And it\u2019s not an accident that these often fall along leave/remain lines.<br><br><strong>But that question</strong><strong> is </strong><strong>immaterial right now. The much </strong><strong>more important question is </strong><strong>whether we are leaving Europe on the back of an illegal and corrupted vote \u2013 and that</strong><strong> has been completely glossed over.</strong></p> <p>The challenge as a creative team is how to invite different audience members, who voted differently, into a space that doesn\u2019t immediately yell at them: \u201cYou\u2019re wrong and we\u2019re right.

The scene with the focus group illustrated the toxicity of this debate with a use of imagination and dialogue that did not mess with the historical record. Whereas that last scene messes with the historical record. It\u2019s not just that it didn\u2019t happen, it is laundering Cummings\u2019 reputation. He is portrayed as a misunderstood man who ran a controversial but legal campaign and is happy to answer questions about what he did. But he isn\u2019t. He\u2019s obfuscated his role and what the campaign did and the illegal methods employed. We are using drama as a public space in a courtroom to drag into it the questions and the answers that are vital for an audience to explore. I don\u2019t agree it\u2019s fucking with the historical record. If it is a creative failing of mine not to make that clear, I will take that on board. It\u2019s certainly not our intention to mislead, and I\u2019m happy for you to set the record straight. It\u2019s why we\u2019re here. I was asked to be a consultant on this film a year ago, but I told the production company it was too soon because there were major revelations still to come. I can see that the effort that\u2019s gone into adding tweaks to the film, but the overspending scandal revealed by Shahmir Sanni did not make the film even though it played a huge part in how they won. It\u2019s been whitewashed from history. I thought the most responsible thing to do was to acknowledge this had come out \u2013 we show those characters from BeLeave with the characters of Douglas Carswell and Daniel Hannan questioning their funding \u2013 and then reference it at the end. Where there are disputed areas, we\u2019ve tried to handle that more sensitively and spend more time in the areas that interest me as a writer. I saw this not as a tick list of everything that happened but as a character study of those who made the decisions. Part of the problem, I think, is that you\u2019ve written the part of Cummings so well and Benedict Cumberbatch plays him so wonderfully. But he also brings baggage to the role. Cummings is a sort of Sherlock character, a maverick polymath who brilliantly solves the problems nobody else can. This portrayal makes out that he won through his genius, not by employing criminal methods. And because the writing and performance are great, this is what will stick in people\u2019s minds. But what has been interesting about the response so far is how mixed it is to the presentation of Cummings. Some accuse me of demonising him, others of lionising him. Some say he\u2019s presented as a charlatan, some say a genius. And it\u2019s not an accident that these often fall along leave/remain lines. But that question is immaterial right now. The much more important question is whether we are leaving Europe on the back of an illegal and corrupted vote \u2013 and that has been completely glossed over. The challenge as a creative team is how to invite different audience members, who voted differently, into a space that doesn\u2019t immediately yell at them: \u201cYou\u2019re wrong and we\u2019re right. And you\u2019re not welcome here.\u201d Talk me through your dramatic portrayal of Arron Banks, Robert Mercer and co. For me, when it came to Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Banks, Farage, there was latitude to apply a more heightened presentation using the classic British weapon of caricature as a way of bringing people down from their pedestal. So that was a driving motivator. What did you think about them? Banks is not like that in real life. And I found the scene with Mercer completely preposterous. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s all right. For an entire year, our stories about Cambridge Analytica were treated by swaths of the press as fantasy conspiracy stories, and it\u2019s still a problem in terms of getting a serious investigation into these allegations. And the James Bond villain-like presentation of Mercer plays into that and will only add to that difficulty. In terms of putting people in rooms, or conflating meetings, or having events merge into one thing, that didn\u2019t literally happen. To a lot of audience members, some of these people and these ideas are very unknowable and inaccessible and remote, and it\u2019s how you can use your weapons as a dramatist to bring them closer to people. It\u2019s how you give voice and visual representation to the essence of the truth and the essence of the story \u2026 But the essence of that was not the truth. And this is Cummings\u2019 version of history. You take him at his word that he was the genius who took Britain out of the EU. And by presenting Farage and Banks as buffoons, you dismiss the impact of their campaign and what they were doing with technology and the possibly illegal \u00a38m donation that\u2019s now under investigation and the whole question of their relationship with the Russian government. I disagree he\u2019s a buffoon. In fact, Steve Bannon criticised me for giving the Banks characters some of his best lines. I don\u2019t disagree with you that the Leave.EU side of things is hugely important. The truth must out and justice be done, and once it comes out fully I hope someone dramatises that story. I\u2019d happily work with you on it. And this is fiction. An audience knows that. It\u2019s a drama. You fictionalise from facts. That\u2019s what you do, isn\u2019t it? But the facts are still in dispute. We are in an existential struggle to establish the truth, and this feels like another threat to that. I hear you and acknowledge the struggle you\u2019ve had to fight, but I don\u2019t think a dramatic representation exists in opposition to the journalistic work. I think it contributes. Everything contributes to \u2013 I hate this phrase \u2013 a national conversation. There are critical unanswered questions about the impact that data targeting has on our politics and behaviour. I don\u2019t want the film to suggest we can all be manipulated \u2013 most of us know our own minds. But we\u2019re in the wild west phase of this technology, completely unregulated and we need to understand the impact that it is having.",

The team had earlier denied there was any change of leadership expected but after failing to mount a season-long challenge to Mercedes in 2018 Arrivabene has been dispensed with after four years in charge \u2013 and only two months before the new F1 season begins. Arrivabene has most recently overseen two years when the Scuderia were found wanting against Mercedes. Last year was a particular disappointment: despite having the quicker car for considerable periods, a series of driver errors by Sebastian Vettel were compounded by team mistakes that saw their challenge falter and Lewis Hamilton taking the title with two races remaining. \u201cAfter four years of untiring commitment and dedication Maurizio Arrivabene is leaving the team,\u201d Ferrari said in a statement. \u201cThe decision was taken together with the company\u2019s top management after lengthy discussions related to Maurizio\u2019s long-term personal interests as well as those of the team itself. Ferrari would like to thank Maurizio for his valuable contribution to the team\u2019s increasing competitiveness over the past few years and wish him the best for his future endeavours. With immediate effect Mattia Binotto will take over as Scuderia Ferrari\u2019s team principal.\u201d Arrivabene, who is 61, joined Ferrari in 2014 having previously been vice-president at the tobacco company Philip Morris, a long-term sponsor of the team. Vettel was responsible for some of their failings in 2018 but the team notably let him down operationally, failing to institute clear orders on occasion and making the wrong tyre choice in qualifying in Japan, an error for which Arrivabene turned on his team. Binotto is understood to have been favoured by the former Ferrari president Sergio Marchionne and has extensive pedigree. He joined Ferrari as test race engineer in 1995 and has since been race engine engineer, race engineer and head of engines before being made chief technical officer in 2016, a role in which he has been credited with returning Ferrari to the front of the grid. He will take charge of Vettel and Ferrari\u2019s new driver, Charles Leclerc.",

In the wake of mounting concern among teachers and parents about a school budget crisis, the education secretary, Damian Hinds, told MPs last year that a new national funding formula would guarantee each school \u201cat least a small cash increase\u201d, a pledge repeated by the prime minister in the Commons last May. The National Education Union argued the offer was inadequate given the scale of the school funding squeeze, but its analysis of recent government figures subsequently revealed that 4,819 schools had either received no extra funds or had had their budget cut. \u201cThis is yet another failure and another broken promise by government on school funding,\u201d said Kevin Courtney, NEU joint general secretary. \u201cThe fact remains that schools were never going to manage on the money promised by government. \u201cHowever, headteachers, teachers, school staff and parents will be dismayed that even the meagre amounts of funds supposedly allocated to schools will not be received by everyone. Parents and school staff simply cannot trust what the government says on education funding.\u201d The NEU compared the schools block funding allocations for 2017-18 and 2018-19 and found that a quarter of primary schools (25%) and one in six secondary schools (17%) either received no cash increase or suffered an actual cut to their funding. Responding to the NEU analysis, a Department for Education (DfE) spokesperson said that since 2017 the government had given every local authority more money for every pupil in every school in order to ensure fairer funding across the country. \u201cGovernment provides this money to local authorities and they have the freedom to work with schools to allocate their budgets in a way that best suits local needs,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWhile there is more money going into our schools than ever before, we do recognise the budgeting challenges schools face and that we are asking them to do more. That\u2019s why we\u2019re supporting schools and headteachers, and their local authorities, to make the most of every pound.\u201d According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, total school spending per pupil in England has fallen by about 8% in real terms between 2009-10 and 2017-18. While schools have been struggling to meet rising costs, many local authorities have been forced to divert money from the main schools funding block they receive from the government to their high needs budget in order to meet growing demand for special educational needs support \u2013 a move that has to be sanctioned by the DfE. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said Labour would end funding cuts and increase per-pupil funding. \u201cThe Tories have cut billions of pounds from our schools, which have seen their budgets falling for the first time in a generation,\u201d she said. \u201cWith rising pressure on class sizes and teachers leaving in droves, a generation of children is paying the price for Tory failure.\u201d",

Meirion James, from the village of Crymych, Pembrokeshire, was sprayed with Pava spray \u2013 a type of incapacitant \u2013 as he dashed into a corridor at Haverfordwest police station. James, 53, had been arrested after calling the police himself following an altercation with his mother. The hearing was told that James was diagnosed with manic depression in the mid-1980s and that his mental state would deteriorate on occasions. In the autumn of 2014, James\u2019s treatment changed, the inquest heard. The coroner, Paul Bennett, said he came off medication that he had been taking for a number of years and James felt the new treatment was not as effective. On 30 January 2015, James was involved in a car accident and the police were called. Officers took him to Bronglais hospital in Aberystwyth and he returned home from there. The jury heard that in the early hours of 31 January, James became aggressive and assaulted his mother. James called the police and was arrested and taken to the police station. Later that morning, he was assessed by a medic who concluded he was fit to be detained. The inquest heard that when officers went to James\u2019s cell at about 11am to check on him, he burst out of the cell and into the corridor. Officers tried to restrain him and Pava spray was also used, the jury heard. James became unresponsive, and despite efforts to resuscitate him at the police station and at Withybush hospital in Haverfordwest, he was pronounced dead at 11.30am. The inquest at Haverfordwest, which is due to last two weeks, will explore a wide range of issues, including: The management of James by police officers on 30 January and their handover to staff at Bronglais hospital. The treatment of James at Bronglais hospital. His management at Haverfordwest police station on 31 January. The restraint on 31 January 2015 and the emergency response thereafter. Training of the police officers. Before the start of the inquest, James\u2019s sister, Diana Vaughan-Thomas, said on behalf of the family: \u201cWe have had to wait four years for this inquest.

The Indian Pacific shows us the nation\u2019s longest train journey, from Perth to Sydney; and the Kimberley Cruise follows 10 days of bay-hopping from Broome to Darwin.</p> <p>I watched only the three-hour versions this time, but extended 17-hour and 14-hour cuts of both shows will be shown on SBS Viceland in a series of all-day extravaganzas.</p> <p>It may sound boring. In many ways, it is. But slow TV is designed to be calming: a cocktail of beautiful scenery, historical facts and the slow, nudging propulsion of constant movement.</p> <p>The Indian Pacific features the world\u2019s longest stretch of completely straight rail \u2013 477km with nothing so disruptive as a corner. The BBC has previously broadcast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/05/handmade-glass-metal-nice-and-slow-bbc4\">the making of a glass jug</a>.</p> <p>But the thing about slow TV \u2013 specifically, as it is done by Australia\u2019s own Mint Pictures \u2013 is that it is actually a genius, and quite powerful, act of historical revisionism.</p> <p>Through informative text, these journeys show you the history of Indigenous nations that colonists tried to wipe out, and<strong> </strong>the migrant history that, without fail, stretches back further than you\u2019d think.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0dc0e1b83cf1cb3f770ab8cbbc02a9d8ee17cb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0dc0e1b83cf1cb3f770ab8cbbc02a9d8ee17cb8/0_0_964_539/500.png\" alt=\"A fact about the Barkandji people of New South Wales as part of The Indian Pacific.\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fact about the Barkandji people of New South Wales as part of The Indian Pacific.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SBS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is not just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2013/oct/03/norwegian-tv-knitathon-slow-tv\">12 hours of a sweater being knitted</a>. It has a point.</p> <p>For viewers of The Ghan, The Indian Pacific will be the most familiar of the two, as it too is a train. The four-day trip crosses 133 towns, three states and more than a dozen Indigenous boundaries.</p> <p>The cinematography is phenomenal \u2013 there has been a noticeable step-up in budget since The Ghan. Drone shots follow the train from outside; helicopters whirl above.</p> <p>It is a beautiful, slow-moving portrait of Australia where, thankfully, lack of attention is actually rewarded. You can go off, do something else and come back to a stunning contrast. Perth is shot in greens and blues, all pooled water and the Swan River. The Goldfields look like an abstract painting: yellow ground, blue sky, the train in the middle. By New South Wales, a heavy grey fog descends.</p> <p>Of course, it does take forever. From Perth, the program tells us, Singapore and Indonesia are closer than Sydney. The shock of that is a neat summary for the whole experience. Our country always shrinks in the imagination \u2013 becoming just the cities or just the coast. Sitting through the space in between is the whole point. Marking out, over and over again, the First Nations languages and nation borders which always covered the country.<strong> </strong>Sometimes scale can only be communicated by scale.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bc5f01257463c2c3fe5138efb09065b33c5d04f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bc5f01257463c2c3fe5138efb09065b33c5d04f/0_0_958_537/500.png\" alt=\"The Indian Pacific as it crosses the Goldfields of Western Australia.\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Indian Pacific as it crosses the Goldfields of Western Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SBS / Mint Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Across that 477km straight stretch, we see where the British tested nuclear bombs and sprayed the fallout over the Tjarutja people, and where anthropologist Daisy Bates predicted Indigenous people would become extinct. Every step of the way, the train\u2019s journey proves her wrong.</p> <p>While The Ghan explored the oft-neglected centre and north of Australia, The Indian Pacific does the same for the west. \u201cPrior to 1917,\u201d it says, \u201call eastern capitals were linked by rail \u2026 except Western Australia. The only way to travel west was via the dangerous waters of the Great Australian Bight.\u201d Trundling out of East Perth station, it gives the whole journey a surprising sense of poetic justice.</p> <p>In contrast, The Kimberley Cruise takes us on a well-worn journey. We follow cruise ship Coral Discoverer from Broome to Darwin across 10 days, spanning 40,000 years of Indigenous history, and the routes of \u201cMuslim traders, European explorers, pirates and refugees\u201d \u2013 which is really Australia in a sentence.</p> <p>If The Ghan and The Indian Pacific are programs of forward movement, the Kimberley Cruise has more of a circular feel \u2013 more swinging, rotating aerial sweeps; currents and eddies; literal whirlpools.</p> <p>Like any journey into the Top End, The Kimberley Cruise is also a reminder of Australia\u2019s long history with Asia. It takes us past tamarind trees planted by Indonesian traders who visited Indigenous people in the mid-1700s, and the ports that took in Vietnamese refugees in the 1970s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"245da5af923fc4e1cfaa1a6474b25196d160d127\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/245da5af923fc4e1cfaa1a6474b25196d160d127/77_0_836_488/500.png\" alt=\"Still from The Kimberley Cruise.\" width=\"500\" height=\"292\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sometimes scale can only be communicated by scale.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SBS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Horizontal Falls, once described by David Attenborough as Australia\u2019s \u201cmost unusual natural wonder\u201d, we are treated to a shockingly high-octane sequence, shot by a Go-Pro stuck on the gunwhale of a speedboat in a whirlpool. On a trip into the Hunter River, a crocodile starts stalking the boat. You see it catch and eat a turtle.</p> <p>The highs of The Kimberley Cruise are high \u2013 the lulls, a bit boring. But of course your mileage may vary. Most of the time, five minutes dipping in and out is enough. It\u2019s the kind of show they should really play on a loop. You see incredibly interesting things in a very short amount of time.</p> <p>At the end of the day, slow TV is an experience that you yourself shape. It\u2019s undemanding and forgiving. You get what you put in. It\u2019s a serene, stunning journey into parts of the country we neglect, and the history we mostly never learned.

The Ghan, Australia\u2019s first foray into the Norwegian genre of \u201cslow TV\u201d, wound its way from Adelaide to Port Pirie to Alice Springs to Darwin and into my heart. In fact, the program averaged more than 400,000 viewers \u2013 and building from its success, this year two new documentaries join a \u201cslow summer\u201d of extremely extensive programming on SBS. The Indian Pacific shows us the nation\u2019s longest train journey, from Perth to Sydney; and the Kimberley Cruise follows 10 days of bay-hopping from Broome to Darwin. I watched only the three-hour versions this time, but extended 17-hour and 14-hour cuts of both shows will be shown on SBS Viceland in a series of all-day extravaganzas. It may sound boring. In many ways, it is. But slow TV is designed to be calming: a cocktail of beautiful scenery, historical facts and the slow, nudging propulsion of constant movement. The Indian Pacific features the world\u2019s longest stretch of completely straight rail \u2013 477km with nothing so disruptive as a corner. The BBC has previously broadcast the making of a glass jug. But the thing about slow TV \u2013 specifically, as it is done by Australia\u2019s own Mint Pictures \u2013 is that it is actually a genius, and quite powerful, act of historical revisionism. Through informative text, these journeys show you the history of Indigenous nations that colonists tried to wipe out, and the migrant history that, without fail, stretches back further than you\u2019d think. This is not just 12 hours of a sweater being knitted. It has a point. For viewers of The Ghan, The Indian Pacific will be the most familiar of the two, as it too is a train. The four-day trip crosses 133 towns, three states and more than a dozen Indigenous boundaries. The cinematography is phenomenal \u2013 there has been a noticeable step-up in budget since The Ghan. Drone shots follow the train from outside; helicopters whirl above. It is a beautiful, slow-moving portrait of Australia where, thankfully, lack of attention is actually rewarded. You can go off, do something else and come back to a stunning contrast. Perth is shot in greens and blues, all pooled water and the Swan River. The Goldfields look like an abstract painting: yellow ground, blue sky, the train in the middle. By New South Wales, a heavy grey fog descends. Of course, it does take forever. From Perth, the program tells us, Singapore and Indonesia are closer than Sydney. The shock of that is a neat summary for the whole experience. Our country always shrinks in the imagination \u2013 becoming just the cities or just the coast. Sitting through the space in between is the whole point. Marking out, over and over again, the First Nations languages and nation borders which always covered the country. Sometimes scale can only be communicated by scale. Across that 477km straight stretch, we see where the British tested nuclear bombs and sprayed the fallout over the Tjarutja people, and where anthropologist Daisy Bates predicted Indigenous people would become extinct. Every step of the way, the train\u2019s journey proves her wrong. While The Ghan explored the oft-neglected centre and north of Australia, The Indian Pacific does the same for the west. \u201cPrior to 1917,\u201d it says, \u201call eastern capitals were linked by rail \u2026 except Western Australia. The only way to travel west was via the dangerous waters of the Great Australian Bight.\u201d Trundling out of East Perth station, it gives the whole journey a surprising sense of poetic justice. In contrast, The Kimberley Cruise takes us on a well-worn journey. We follow cruise ship Coral Discoverer from Broome to Darwin across 10 days, spanning 40,000 years of Indigenous history, and the routes of \u201cMuslim traders, European explorers, pirates and refugees\u201d \u2013 which is really Australia in a sentence. If The Ghan and The Indian Pacific are programs of forward movement, the Kimberley Cruise has more of a circular feel \u2013 more swinging, rotating aerial sweeps; currents and eddies; literal whirlpools. Like any journey into the Top End, The Kimberley Cruise is also a reminder of Australia\u2019s long history with Asia. It takes us past tamarind trees planted by Indonesian traders who visited Indigenous people in the mid-1700s, and the ports that took in Vietnamese refugees in the 1970s. At Horizontal Falls, once described by David Attenborough as Australia\u2019s \u201cmost unusual natural wonder\u201d, we are treated to a shockingly high-octane sequence, shot by a Go-Pro stuck on the gunwhale of a speedboat in a whirlpool. On a trip into the Hunter River, a crocodile starts stalking the boat. You see it catch and eat a turtle. The highs of The Kimberley Cruise are high \u2013 the lulls, a bit boring. But of course your mileage may vary. Most of the time, five minutes dipping in and out is enough. It\u2019s the kind of show they should really play on a loop. You see incredibly interesting things in a very short amount of time. At the end of the day, slow TV is an experience that you yourself shape. It\u2019s undemanding and forgiving. You get what you put in. It\u2019s a serene, stunning journey into parts of the country we neglect, and the history we mostly never learned. If you\u2019re interested, then it\u2019s interesting. The Indian Pacific (three hours) is available on SBS On Demand; the 17-hour version will air on Saturday 12 January on SBS Viceland. The Kimberley Cruise (three hours) will air on Sunday 13 January on SBS at 7.30pm; the 14-hour version will air on Saturday 19 January on SBS Viceland.",

But never mind. After 71 years of trying, India had finally won a Test series in Australia. The manner in which it arrived was scarcely relevant.</p> <p>My first clear memory of an Indian visit was 1999, when the visitors were towelled up by Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath. The images that remain are players like Sadagoppan Ramesh and MSK Prasad battling away with a voracious slip cordon waiting. Blue Indian helmets getting badged. Brett Lee appearing out of nowhere and smashing stumps. The pace and seam always seemed too much, like such a team could never have a chance in these conditions.</p> <p>On later trips, even with the purest batting pedigree that read Tendulkar, Dravid, Laxman, Sehwag, Ganguly, their teams couldn\u2019t win. Australia\u2019s bowlers wouldn\u2019t always find a way past, but they would find one often enough. India\u2019s bowlers were never a match, relying on one or two when four were needed. Anil Kumble seemed to bear the weight of 10 teammates on his upright shoulders.</p> <p>India only once had a great set of bowlers at the same time: the ever-linked names of Chandrasekhar, Bedi, Prasanna and Venkataraghavan. Usually three of the four spinners would take the field at once, as they did in Australia in 1977-78. In one of the great series, India led 2-1 and entered the fifth Test at 2-2. Facing down an absurd run chase of 493 in Adelaide, they ended up falling short with a score of 445.</p> <p>There have been other memorable contests. Even as Donald Bradman gorged runs while his team handed out thrashings in 1947-48, Australian crowds saw moments of brilliance from Vijay Hazare, Vinoo Mankad and Lala Amarnath.</p> <p>The drawn series in 2003-04 was a classic, the way Dravid responded to Ricky Ponting run for run, the way Ajit Agarkar swung out Australia in Adelaide, and the way India pressed for victory at the SCG. Not quite. Nor in January 2008, when India lost the Sydney Test in the dying minutes, and eventually the series 2-1. Had they won in Sydney that year, perhaps they would never have gone on to win in Perth. But who knows.</p> <p>At last, though, they have it. The 2018-19 series. Not such a classic, and not against such strong opposition, but a series belongs squarely to India. A team with one great batsman and a couple of very good ones. But the difference now is the existence of a bowling attack. A genuine one, four bowlers without a weak link. Eight if you count the rest of the squad. All of them bar Bhuvneshwar Kumar were called upon, and Bhuvneshwar is quality enough that he would have delivered.</p> <p>That still shouldn\u2019t have been enough. There were always supposed to be a few Australian batting performances, with home conditions offering a boost to modest batsmen. One more good knock in Adelaide, a couple of decent ones in Melbourne, and the series could easily have been Australia\u2019s. That this wasn\u2019t allowed to happen was down to India\u2019s relentlessness.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the best batting side but it is the best bowling side,\u201d was the assessment from long-time Indian broadcaster Harsha Bhogle. \u201cAnd bowlers win series.\u201d</p> <p>Which doesn\u2019t mean you can disregard Cheteshwar Pujara.

      "bodyText": "This is the way a series ends: not with a bang but a whimper. Called off for the sake of precipitation that didn\u2019t even count as rain, specks of moisture that lacked the energy to fall and so just wafted about laterally in wispy veils like a Bonnie Tyler dress. No play on the fifth day of the Sydney Test meant that the finale of match and series was an anticlimax. But the substance of the series entire remained deeply significant. An abandoned match only meant that India won 2-1 rather than 3-1. The latter would have been more fitting, given how dominant the visitors have been. But never mind. After 71 years of trying, India had finally won a Test series in Australia. The manner in which it arrived was scarcely relevant. My first clear memory of an Indian visit was 1999, when the visitors were towelled up by Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath. The images that remain are players like Sadagoppan Ramesh and MSK Prasad battling away with a voracious slip cordon waiting. Blue Indian helmets getting badged. Brett Lee appearing out of nowhere and smashing stumps. The pace and seam always seemed too much, like such a team could never have a chance in these conditions. On later trips, even with the purest batting pedigree that read Tendulkar, Dravid, Laxman, Sehwag, Ganguly, their teams couldn\u2019t win. Australia\u2019s bowlers wouldn\u2019t always find a way past, but they would find one often enough. India\u2019s bowlers were never a match, relying on one or two when four were needed. Anil Kumble seemed to bear the weight of 10 teammates on his upright shoulders. India only once had a great set of bowlers at the same time: the ever-linked names of Chandrasekhar, Bedi, Prasanna and Venkataraghavan. Usually three of the four spinners would take the field at once, as they did in Australia in 1977-78. In one of the great series, India led 2-1 and entered the fifth Test at 2-2. Facing down an absurd run chase of 493 in Adelaide, they ended up falling short with a score of 445. There have been other memorable contests. Even as Donald Bradman gorged runs while his team handed out thrashings in 1947-48, Australian crowds saw moments of brilliance from Vijay Hazare, Vinoo Mankad and Lala Amarnath. The drawn series in 2003-04 was a classic, the way Dravid responded to Ricky Ponting run for run, the way Ajit Agarkar swung out Australia in Adelaide, and the way India pressed for victory at the SCG. Not quite. Nor in January 2008, when India lost the Sydney Test in the dying minutes, and eventually the series 2-1. Had they won in Sydney that year, perhaps they would never have gone on to win in Perth. But who knows. At last, though, they have it. The 2018-19 series. Not such a classic, and not against such strong opposition, but a series belongs squarely to India. A team with one great batsman and a couple of very good ones. But the difference now is the existence of a bowling attack. A genuine one, four bowlers without a weak link. Eight if you count the rest of the squad. All of them bar Bhuvneshwar Kumar were called upon, and Bhuvneshwar is quality enough that he would have delivered. That still shouldn\u2019t have been enough. There were always supposed to be a few Australian batting performances, with home conditions offering a boost to modest batsmen. One more good knock in Adelaide, a couple of decent ones in Melbourne, and the series could easily have been Australia\u2019s. That this wasn\u2019t allowed to happen was down to India\u2019s relentlessness. \u201cIt\u2019s not the best batting side but it is the best bowling side,\u201d was the assessment from long-time Indian broadcaster Harsha Bhogle. \u201cAnd bowlers win series.\u201d Which doesn\u2019t mean you can disregard Cheteshwar Pujara. There would have been no win without him either, a player who once struggled overseas, but who turned on three centuries to set up the win. In Adelaide he averted a 1-0 deficit. Melbourne was all Pujara, and Sydney would have been a third win if not for rain. He faced 1,258 balls in the series, the third-most in any series between the countries, and from fewer innings than Kim Hughes and David Boon ahead of him. He protected a fragile middle order and tail, and wore out Australia\u2019s bowlers almost on his own. His captain Virat Kohli, on whom hopes have so often depended, made one century for the series, in the loss at Perth. And things turned out fine regardless. Kohli traced his team\u2019s evolution back to Sydney four years earlier, on India\u2019s 2014-15 tour. \u201cThis particular venue is where M.S.

The answer is nothing, nothing at all \u2026 because what you want to do is get those vehicles off the road. If owners of those vehicles think \u2018we\u2019ll take the penalty and just drive as usual\u2019, it\u2019s all a waste of time.\u201d</p> <p>Ganotis said it was \u201cnot right\u201d that the government was forcing Greater Manchester and other councils to take drastic action on air pollution while not asking the same of Highways England, formerly the Highways Agency, which owns the motorway network as well as many A-roads.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to be very clear that Highways Agency, which runs the motorway network, has to be part of the solution to this. Think about the way the motorway network is embedded across Greater Manchester, the way it dissects our communities \u2026 The motorway network heavily contributes towards the air quality issue in Greater Manchester,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The government believes clean air zones do not seek to reduce the number of vehicles on roads but encourage people to switch to less polluting vehicles, a view opposed by many environmental campaigners.</p> <p>Ganotis demanded help from the government to help people switch without it costing them personally. \u201cWe need a package that encourages and facilitates vehicle renewal so that people can avoid those penalties, for example, fully funded scrappage schemes and retrofitting of vehicles, so that we can have vehicles that comply with air quality levels but do it in a way that doesn\u2019t hit business in the pocket. We need assistance from this. That has to come from the government,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A similar proposal is under consultation in Leeds, with potential daily fees ranging from \u00a312.50 for taxis and private hire vehicles to \u00a3100 for buses, coaches and HGVs.</p> <p>In central London, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/05/londons-ultra-low-emission-zone-what-you-need-to-know\">ultra-low emission zone</a> will be introduced on 8 April.

The proposal comes after the government ordered Greater Manchester and more than 60 other local authorities to reduce road transport emissions. Announcing the proposal on Monday, Burnham said it would not be a congestion charge, an idea rejected by 79% of voters in a 2008 referendum. \u201cI want to stress two things as emphatically as I can,\u201d he said. \u201cFirstly, this is not a charge to use the roads \u2013 a congestion charge \u2013 but instead a penalty scheme for non-compliant vehicles. People with a compliant vehicle would have no fine to pay. Second, this proposal would not apply to private cars registered in Greater Manchester, 80% of which are already compliant. We believe that restrictions on the remaining 20% would be neither progressive nor proportionate.\u201d The air quality in parts of the region already breaches legal limits, with one Manchester primary school unable to open windows because the pollution is at such a dangerous level. About 1,200 Greater Mancunians die prematurely because of related respiratory problems, according to official estimates, and central Manchester has the highest rate of emergency hospital admissions for asthma in England, at more than double the national average. Alex Ganotis, the leader of Stockport council and the Greater Manchester lead on air pollution, said it was not a money-making exercise for the combined authority. Speaking at the launch of Greater Manchester\u2019s future plan, he said: \u201cWhat should be the aim of a penalty regime in terms of how much money it should raise? The answer is nothing, nothing at all \u2026 because what you want to do is get those vehicles off the road. If owners of those vehicles think \u2018we\u2019ll take the penalty and just drive as usual\u2019, it\u2019s all a waste of time.\u201d Ganotis said it was \u201cnot right\u201d that the government was forcing Greater Manchester and other councils to take drastic action on air pollution while not asking the same of Highways England, formerly the Highways Agency, which owns the motorway network as well as many A-roads. \u201cWe need to be very clear that Highways Agency, which runs the motorway network, has to be part of the solution to this. Think about the way the motorway network is embedded across Greater Manchester, the way it dissects our communities \u2026 The motorway network heavily contributes towards the air quality issue in Greater Manchester,\u201d he said. The government believes clean air zones do not seek to reduce the number of vehicles on roads but encourage people to switch to less polluting vehicles, a view opposed by many environmental campaigners. Ganotis demanded help from the government to help people switch without it costing them personally. \u201cWe need a package that encourages and facilitates vehicle renewal so that people can avoid those penalties, for example, fully funded scrappage schemes and retrofitting of vehicles, so that we can have vehicles that comply with air quality levels but do it in a way that doesn\u2019t hit business in the pocket. We need assistance from this. That has to come from the government,\u201d he said. A similar proposal is under consultation in Leeds, with potential daily fees ranging from \u00a312.50 for taxis and private hire vehicles to \u00a3100 for buses, coaches and HGVs. In central London, an ultra-low emission zone will be introduced on 8 April. Most vehicles including cars and vans will need to meet stricter exhaust emission standards or pay a daily charge from \u00a312.50 to travel within the restricted area.",

      "bodyText": "With a government torn apart by Brexit and a country falling to pieces because of that government, Conservative MPs have a fallback they sometimes like to use as proof of their success: the UK has record employment levels. It\u2019s a proud badge of honour they wear, fetishising work \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter what that work looks like or how much it pays \u2013 because it\u2019s supposedly a sign that the economy is doing well. The thing is, people might be in work, but they\u2019re also in debt. Britain\u2019s household debt has reached a new high. According to the TUC, UK households now owe an average of \u00a315,385 to credit card firms, banks and other lenders. There might be some quibbling over what\u2019s included in these figures. Unlike the Bank of England, in its calculations the TUC includes increasingly exorbitant student loans, which have eye-wateringly high interest rates. But even if we were to take those out of the equation \u2013 leaving debt at half that estimated by the TUC \u2013 the level of debt, the nature of that borrowing and why it\u2019s being accrued spells trouble. In 2017, academic Johnna Montgomerie called it \u201cone of the biggest problems facing the United Kingdom\u2019s economy and society\u201d. Debt isn\u2019t always bad. It\u2019s wrong to continue buying into this idea when we\u2019ve seen what the government\u2019s slashing of budgets to get the deficit down has done to the country. But debt has been commoditised in a way that has made it key to economic \u201cgrowth\u201d, and there\u2019s been a shift from the collective to the individual \u2013 households borrow more, the government less. While the government commends itself on cutting back on borrowing, the essential services that people rely on every day are consequently affected \u2013 and those same people are then judged for getting into debt. It\u2019s assumed they don\u2019t understand how to manage their money or that they frivolously waste what they do have on things they don\u2019t need. Those in debt pay a heavy price: there\u2019s the anxiety of having debt in the first place, and then repayments \u2013 including on high-interest short-term loans \u2013 hang over people\u2019s heads, as their personal circumstances don\u2019t improve in an economy that\u2019s not designed to work for them. And then there\u2019s the stigma of what taking on debt and not being able to escape it means about you: the personal failure it\u2019s assumed to signify. Rising debt is not a personal problem; it\u2019s a political one. The debt crisis has longer historical roots, but it\u2019s also been stimulated by recent government policy. Since 2010, wages have stagnated, or in some cases declined; in-work poverty has increased, as has the cost of living; and jobs have become increasingly insecure. Meanwhile, the government has been aggressively making cuts to state support and funding for key services. In this climate, for far too many people, taking on a significant amount of debt isn\u2019t a choice, but a necessity. They have to take out loans to buy household goods or for the basics they need to get by, like paying utility bills \u2013 and it\u2019s the poorest households that suffer the most. At the same time as household debt has been piling up, wealth is sloshing around at the top of society. Globally, the richest 1% own half of all wealth. Last week, just four days into the year, the UK marked Fat Cat Friday: the point in the year at which the average CEO of a FTSE 100 company has earned the equivalent yearly take-home pay of an average full-time worker. This is Philip Hammond\u2019s \u201ceconomy that works for everyone\u201d. Obsession with growth, no matter what that growth looks like or who it hurts, and alarming narratives about national (but not household) debt, obscure this worrying picture. \u201cRecovery\u201d and \u201cjob growth\u201d built on the backs of people racking up debt is sign of a government that has no intention of redesigning the economy to benefit the majority. It\u2019s hardly something to be proud of. \u2022 Maya Goodfellow is a writer and researcher, and a columnist for Media Diversified and LabourList",

It was all so hotly contested that two things happened: first a conspiracy theory that, since Greggs was represented by the same PR agency that once did a book with Piers Morgan \u2013 Taylor Herring \u2013 it was probably all a concoction (it wasn\u2019t \u2013 the PR for the roll was handled in-house); the second was that the vegan sausage rolls sold out.

You have to conclude it is creating a deliberate scarcity; you don\u2019t get to be Greggs by failing to adapt to pastry demand from one day to the next. But here I go again, with the conspiracies.</p> <p>It pushed some buttons, this delicious flaky-pastry ersatz meat product, and they weren\u2019t so much about veganism \u2013 or if so, only indirectly \u2013 as they were about politics and class. Greggs occupies a very specific place on the British high street, partly because it has a mission. I remember going to a meeting about the future of work \u2013 it was off the record so I couldn\u2019t quote Mr Greggs Rep even if I could remember his name, but the gist was that it always tries to employ young people from the area of the shop, if it can. It wasn\u2019t an insular or xenophobic point; it wasn\u2019t about anyone driving or not driving down wages and conditions. It was that locals tended to be a bit younger, and it\u2019s actually really hard, if you\u2019re 18, to go up against a 22-year-old. But you still need a job, and you could still do a job, if someone would give you one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb8f9da0ac3b3ec29fcf5d48623e29701af3fba2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb8f9da0ac3b3ec29fcf5d48623e29701af3fba2/0_90_3200_1919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bakers protest against the \u2018pasty tax\u2019 in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bakers protest against the \u2018pasty tax\u2019 in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geoff Caddick/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can look at high streets from Eastleigh to Rotherham, which large chains have vacated, leaving nothing but charity shops selling nothing but secondhand fleeces, and there will always be one Greggs, sometimes two within 50 yards of each other. The company has become associated, not with corporate social responsibility, with all those nannyish and whitewashing connotations, but with the more ineffable quality of still giving a shit. McDonald\u2019s has launched a vegetarian Happy Meal, but could never spark a controversy like this; it is too global, too disembodied, a citizen of nowhere in the true, rather than Theresa May, sense. It helps that Greggs\u2019 roots are in the north-east of England (though don\u2019t delve too deep into its history, since you\u2019ll turn up the predatory paedophile Colin Gregg, the son of the founder, who somewhat interrupts the EDL narrative that only foreigners harm children).</p> <p>Set against the prevailing line on obesity \u2013 people who eat cheap, processed food are a burden on the NHS and should be ashamed of themselves \u2013 and you have the perfect storm of a divided nation. On one side is a company that still cares; on the other a faceless, finger-wagging elite who don\u2019t understand anything about people\u2019s lives or how delicious those sausage rolls really are.

We\u2019re team mind-your-own-business,\u201d when in fact it was their wealth-supremacist worldview that created the division in the first place.</p> <p>Meanwhile, of course, pork is off on its own mission as the incendiary device in what has now been a long wave of Islamophobia (note: the pork is rarely delicious in this context, but it still tends to be processed). This is no flash in the pan \u2013 in 2012, a man was arrested in Crawley, West Sussex, for throwing ham at a mosque, while another man was arrested four years later for throwing a bag of rancid meat at a mosque in Finsbury Park, north London.

That EDL contingent is heavily invested in pork as a kind of toxic talisman, capable of defiling the enemy while at the same time expressing everything that is great about Britishness. As a product that also offends vegetarians and probably feminists, it\u2019s win-win. It is a perfect case study of the new tactics of the far right: take something that most people like; ascribe to the people who don\u2019t like it feelings far stronger than they really have; roll it into a symbol of hard-nationalism and bigotry; then, with magnificent syllogism, declare that everyone who likes bacon ergo hates Muslims, and also, everyone who likes Muslims probably hates bacon.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2018/may/14/is-it-offensive-to-call-ruddy-faced-middle-aged-tories-gammons\" title=\"\">Gammongate</a>, too, exploded from this tinderbox. On paper, the insult \u201cgammon\u201d was aimed at any angry red-faced man because his face was red like a big ham. The imputation professional offence-takers chose to hear was that it was any working-class man, which it wasn\u2019t (it wasn\u2019t confined to a class, although it was confined to men). But it did mean more than \u201cred-faced\u201d; it meant anyone overinvested in ham qua national identity.</p> <p>If a sausage roll and a vegan sausage roll could exist quite happily side by side, if honest, hard-working meat eaters and self-righteous vegans could all go to the same shop, that would be disastrous for this zero-sum worldview in which obliterating the other is entirely justified by the notion that, otherwise, you yourself, your identity, your honour, your right to brown sauce, will be obliterated. In which case, this may well have been a beautiful, devilish, vast political act by Greggs \u2013 never forget how total its sausage roll dominance is (1.5m sold a week). If it could dominate the vegan market like that, we might be looking at phase one in national healing: we can all think different things but like the same stuff. Who knew Arcadia was a diverse selection of baked goods?</p> <p>I did a taste test, by the way: the Quorn ones taste fleetingly like sausage but have a different texture, a bit firmer and less greasy. Truthfully, both are delicious. The steak and cheese roll, in counterpoint, is totally disgusting.</p>",

I remember going to a meeting about the future of work \u2013 it was off the record so I couldn\u2019t quote Mr Greggs Rep even if I could remember his name, but the gist was that it always tries to employ young people from the area of the shop, if it can. It wasn\u2019t an insular or xenophobic point; it wasn\u2019t about anyone driving or not driving down wages and conditions. It was that locals tended to be a bit younger, and it\u2019s actually really hard, if you\u2019re 18, to go up against a 22-year-old. But you still need a job, and you could still do a job, if someone would give you one. You can look at high streets from Eastleigh to Rotherham, which large chains have vacated, leaving nothing but charity shops selling nothing but secondhand fleeces, and there will always be one Greggs, sometimes two within 50 yards of each other. The company has become associated, not with corporate social responsibility, with all those nannyish and whitewashing connotations, but with the more ineffable quality of still giving a shit. McDonald\u2019s has launched a vegetarian Happy Meal, but could never spark a controversy like this; it is too global, too disembodied, a citizen of nowhere in the true, rather than Theresa May, sense. It helps that Greggs\u2019 roots are in the north-east of England (though don\u2019t delve too deep into its history, since you\u2019ll turn up the predatory paedophile Colin Gregg, the son of the founder, who somewhat interrupts the EDL narrative that only foreigners harm children). Set against the prevailing line on obesity \u2013 people who eat cheap, processed food are a burden on the NHS and should be ashamed of themselves \u2013 and you have the perfect storm of a divided nation. On one side is a company that still cares; on the other a faceless, finger-wagging elite who don\u2019t understand anything about people\u2019s lives or how delicious those sausage rolls really are. Every meaty controversy, from George Osborne\u2019s pasty tax to David Cameron\u2019s pretend-pasty eating, from the cancer scares of bacon to the blanket meat tax proposed by Oxford University at the end of last year, has a bead of this conflict in it: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you poor people take better care of yourselves?\u201d v \u201cWhy don\u2019t you rich people just get permanently out of my face?\u201d Then some rightwing antihero \u2013 Morgan, or Nigel Farage \u2013 rides to the rescue, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t judge! We\u2019re team mind-your-own-business,\u201d when in fact it was their wealth-supremacist worldview that created the division in the first place. Meanwhile, of course, pork is off on its own mission as the incendiary device in what has now been a long wave of Islamophobia (note: the pork is rarely delicious in this context, but it still tends to be processed). This is no flash in the pan \u2013 in 2012, a man was arrested in Crawley, West Sussex, for throwing ham at a mosque, while another man was arrested four years later for throwing a bag of rancid meat at a mosque in Finsbury Park, north London. There are more Reddit threads fantasising about keeping Muslims out of your house by smearing your door handles with bacon than you would credit. All of which is why the confusion last week about a protest outside Greggs \u2013 mistaken for a demo against the vegan sausage roll, actually a demo in support of Brexit \u2013 is understandable. That EDL contingent is heavily invested in pork as a kind of toxic talisman, capable of defiling the enemy while at the same time expressing everything that is great about Britishness. As a product that also offends vegetarians and probably feminists, it\u2019s win-win. It is a perfect case study of the new tactics of the far right: take something that most people like; ascribe to the people who don\u2019t like it feelings far stronger than they really have; roll it into a symbol of hard-nationalism and bigotry; then, with magnificent syllogism, declare that everyone who likes bacon ergo hates Muslims, and also, everyone who likes Muslims probably hates bacon. Gammongate, too, exploded from this tinderbox. On paper, the insult \u201cgammon\u201d was aimed at any angry red-faced man because his face was red like a big ham. The imputation professional offence-takers chose to hear was that it was any working-class man, which it wasn\u2019t (it wasn\u2019t confined to a class, although it was confined to men). But it did mean more than \u201cred-faced\u201d; it meant anyone overinvested in ham qua national identity. If a sausage roll and a vegan sausage roll could exist quite happily side by side, if honest, hard-working meat eaters and self-righteous vegans could all go to the same shop, that would be disastrous for this zero-sum worldview in which obliterating the other is entirely justified by the notion that, otherwise, you yourself, your identity, your honour, your right to brown sauce, will be obliterated. In which case, this may well have been a beautiful, devilish, vast political act by Greggs \u2013 never forget how total its sausage roll dominance is (1.5m sold a week). If it could dominate the vegan market like that, we might be looking at phase one in national healing: we can all think different things but like the same stuff. Who knew Arcadia was a diverse selection of baked goods? I did a taste test, by the way: the Quorn ones taste fleetingly like sausage but have a different texture, a bit firmer and less greasy. Truthfully, both are delicious. The steak and cheese roll, in counterpoint, is totally disgusting.",

It was not a war or even \u201casymmetric warfare\u201d but a one-sided massacre. Israel had 13 dead; the Gazans had 1,417 dead, including 313 children, and more than 5,500 wounded. According to one estimate 83% of the casualties were civilians. Israel claimed to be acting in self-defence, protecting its civilians against Hamas rocket attacks.

Mashaal handed him a written proposal on how to restore the ceasefire. In effect, it was a proposal to renew the June 2008 ceasefire agreement on the original terms. Pastor then travelled to Tel Aviv and met Major General (Ret) Amos Gilad, head of the defence ministry\u2019s political affairs bureau.

Yann Moix, 50, told a glossy magazine: \u201cCome on now, let\u2019s not exaggerate! That\u2019s not possible \u2026 too, too old.\u201d In the interview with Marie-Claire magazine\u2019s French edition, Moix, the author of several prize-winning novels, added that women in their 50s were \u201cinvisible\u201d to him. \u201cI prefer younger women\u2019s bodies, that\u2019s all. End of. The body of a 25-year-old woman is extraordinary. The body of a woman of 50 is not extraordinary at all,\u201d he said, adding that he preferred to date Asian women, particularly Koreans, Chinese and Japanese. \u201cIt\u2019s perhaps sad and reductive for the women I go out with but the Asian type is sufficiently rich, large and infinite for me not to be ashamed.\u201d Moix has won several literary prizes including the prestigious Prix Goncourt for a first novel and the Prix Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac from the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise for his 1996 debut work Jubilations Vers le Ciel, has directed three films and is the host of a popular TV talkshow. His comments caused outrage on social media. The journalist and writer Colombe Schneck, aged 52, published a photo of a backside on her Instagram account. \u201cVoila, the buttocks of a woman aged 52\u2026what an imbecile you are, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing, you and your tiny, paunchy brain.\u201d Feminist author Mona Chollet said Moix was a \u201csad sire\u201d, while Laura Hulley, from the political section of the British Embassy in Paris, tweeted: \u201cHappy new year, sexists everywhere!\u201d Former first lady Valerie Trierweiler tweeted here about Moix in the context of the fourth anniversary of the terrorist attack on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. French MP Olivia Gregoire, a spokeswoman for Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique en Marche (LREM) party, tweeted: \u201cVery classy Yann Moix. Very very classy. But like stupidity and vulgarity have no age, it\u2019s reassuring in his case as I doubt many women want (these qualities).\u201d",

Magellanic penguins finish breeding in Patagonia in February, and during the subsequent winter months head north, reaching as far as Brazil, in search of anchovies. But every year thousands become stranded, with many airlifted to safety onboard military aircraft. Writing in the journal Current Biology, researchers in Japan and Argentina report how they attached tracking devices to eight male and six female penguins in 2017 and tracked where the birds went after they left the breeding grounds of Cabo dos Bah\u00eda in Argentina and began the migration north in April. Previously it was unknown whether males and females took different paths or not. \u201cAlthough some assumptions are made, the exact reason for the female-biased stranding has been unknown due to the lack of information on their behaviour outside the breeding season, despite the growing focus on the conservation of this species,\u201d said Takashi Yamamoto, a co-author of the report from the Institute of Statistical Mathematics in Japan. The results from the study offer a clearer picture. While the authors note that only a small number of penguins were tracked, the females generally travelled further north, with many reaching waters off the coast of Uruguay.

      "body": "<h2><strong>SOME ACTUAL FOOTBALL</strong></h2> <p>Everyone knows it needs to be put out of its misery. Everyone knows it\u2019s living on former glories; that it hasn\u2019t been the same since the late 1990s; that, for all the bullish rhetoric, nobody really cares about it anymore. But that\u2019s enough about The Fiver, because there\u2019s one FA Cup third-round match remaining! Wolves host crisis club Liverpool, who have lost their last one games, at Molineux. And, though neither side will explicitly say as much, the competition is a bit of an unwelcome distraction to their Premier League title ambitions. Liverpool are aiming to win the title for the first time since Doogie Howser, M.D. was in his scalpel-wielding pomp, while Wolves are only two points behind leaders Leicester in Division Two of the Premier League.</p> <p>Neither club would kick the FA Cup out of their trophy room for being an attention-seeker, but nor is either likely to pick their strongest XI. A less humane tea-time email might go so far as to say that, of all the kicks in the teeth the FA Cup has suffered in the last 20 years, none will hurt quite like the sight of names like \u2018S Mignolet\u2019 and \u2018A Moreno\u2019 on Liverpool\u2019s team-sheet. \u201cYes, we have to make changes,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/06/jurgen-klopp-naby-keita-liverpool-wolves-fa-cup\">sighed J\u00fcrgen Klopp</a>, while idly doing unspeakable things to an empty water bottle. \u201cThat\u2019s clear.

But if we were in charge of Wolves, and answered exclusively to the name \u2018Nuno\u2019, we would prioritise the FA Cup. This competition is Wolves\u2019s equivalent of the Premier League, at least until the year 2027 when Jorge Mendes\u2019s plan for world domination is complete. The last time Wolves won a major cup competition, without wishing to coat down the 1987-88 Sherpa Van Trophy, was the League Cup in 1980.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of the history of the club,\u201d said Nuno. \u201cIf we can try to progress and look to the future, and try to be how Wolves were in the \u201850s and \u201860s, it will mean a lot, but we know we have a big task in front of us.\u201d Monday night\u2019s XI will tell us how much Nuno really, really wants to win the FA Cup, or whether the tournament is less important than seventh place. All those who grew up with the FA Cup will hope it can enjoy a renaissance without recourse to gimmicks. And with that, we\u2019re off to see if Kasabian fancy writing Tuesday\u2019s Fiver.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Rob Smyth from 7.45pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Wolves 1-2 Liverpool, followed by the FA Cup fourth-round draw</a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cFor 2019, let\u2019s dot the I\u2019s and cross the T\u2019s \u2026 Let\u2019s start with the jealous, the haters, those only born because a condom had a hole in: [eff] your mothers, your grandmothers and even your family tree.

      "bodyText": "SOME ACTUAL FOOTBALL Everyone knows it needs to be put out of its misery. Everyone knows it\u2019s living on former glories; that it hasn\u2019t been the same since the late 1990s; that, for all the bullish rhetoric, nobody really cares about it anymore. But that\u2019s enough about The Fiver, because there\u2019s one FA Cup third-round match remaining! Wolves host crisis club Liverpool, who have lost their last one games, at Molineux. And, though neither side will explicitly say as much, the competition is a bit of an unwelcome distraction to their Premier League title ambitions. Liverpool are aiming to win the title for the first time since Doogie Howser, M.D. was in his scalpel-wielding pomp, while Wolves are only two points behind leaders Leicester in Division Two of the Premier League. Neither club would kick the FA Cup out of their trophy room for being an attention-seeker, but nor is either likely to pick their strongest XI. A less humane tea-time email might go so far as to say that, of all the kicks in the teeth the FA Cup has suffered in the last 20 years, none will hurt quite like the sight of names like \u2018S Mignolet\u2019 and \u2018A Moreno\u2019 on Liverpool\u2019s team-sheet. \u201cYes, we have to make changes,\u201d sighed J\u00fcrgen Klopp, while idly doing unspeakable things to an empty water bottle. \u201cThat\u2019s clear. We came through the intense period now somehow OK, but of course we have to make changes. How many I don\u2019t know, but we have to.\u201d The Fiver can understand Klopp\u2019s attitude, because he should sacrifice everything \u2013 the FA Cup, dignity, dry January \u2013 in pursuit of the immortality that would come with a league title win. But if we were in charge of Wolves, and answered exclusively to the name \u2018Nuno\u2019, we would prioritise the FA Cup. This competition is Wolves\u2019s equivalent of the Premier League, at least until the year 2027 when Jorge Mendes\u2019s plan for world domination is complete. The last time Wolves won a major cup competition, without wishing to coat down the 1987-88 Sherpa Van Trophy, was the League Cup in 1980. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the history of the club,\u201d said Nuno. \u201cIf we can try to progress and look to the future, and try to be how Wolves were in the \u201850s and \u201860s, it will mean a lot, but we know we have a big task in front of us.\u201d Monday night\u2019s XI will tell us how much Nuno really, really wants to win the FA Cup, or whether the tournament is less important than seventh place. All those who grew up with the FA Cup will hope it can enjoy a renaissance without recourse to gimmicks. And with that, we\u2019re off to see if Kasabian fancy writing Tuesday\u2019s Fiver. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Rob Smyth from 7.45pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Wolves 1-2 Liverpool, followed by the FA Cup fourth-round draw.

The body\u2019s first line of defence against pathogens is a protein called salivary immunoglobulin A. This, says Launay, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15669447\" title=\"\">has been shown to increase</a> as a result of singing with other people\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, singing in groups lowers levels of the stress hormone, cortisol, which naturally spikes in the morning after we wake up, making breakfast time the perfect time for a stress-busting singalong.</p>",

As humans started living in much larger groups, the theory goes, singing evolved as a way to bond to many people at once. Social singing and grooming have, says Launay, \u201cthe same psychological characteristics and associated neurohormonal mechanisms\u201d. Namely, endorphins are released. We most commonly associate endorphins with feeling good after exercise, but, says Launay \u201cour research suggests they are also involved in social bonding\u201d. Ongoing research also shows that musical improvisation, as Cantona does with his songs, leads to even higher endorphin release. Cantona\u2019s immune system will be boosted, too. The body\u2019s first line of defence against pathogens is a protein called salivary immunoglobulin A. This, says Launay, \u201chas been shown to increase as a result of singing with other people\u201d. Meanwhile, singing in groups lowers levels of the stress hormone, cortisol, which naturally spikes in the morning after we wake up, making breakfast time the perfect time for a stress-busting singalong.",

      "bodyText": "Some big, late, breaking news: the head of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, has resigned unexpectedly. Kim will stand down by 1 February \u2013 an abrupt departure, before the before the expiry of his term in 2022. My colleague Phillip Inman explains: The Washington-based organisation is one of the largest donors to developing world countries and while many of its policies have proved controversial. It has been behind huge infrastructure projects across Asia, Africa and south America. Kim\u2019s decision to quit for the private sector was described by sources close to the bank as a \u201cpersonal decision\u201d. Some US news: growth across America\u2019s service sector has slowed, but still remains impressively perky. The institute for Supply Management\u2019s non-manufacturing index has just come in at 57.6 for December, down from 60.7 in November. Any reading above 50 reflects expansion, so this doesn\u2019t suggest the US economy is cooling sharply. Time for a quick recap UK car sales have fallen at the fastest rate since the world was plunging into the great recession a decade ago. New data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that car registrations slid by 6.8% last year, the second annual decline in a row. Sales of vans also saw a smaller decline, fuelling worries over the UK economy. Analysts have blamed three factors: Brexit uncertainty. Weak consumer confidence has left individuals and businesses reluctant to invest The 2015 diesel emissions scandal. This has deterred consumers from buying new models and hurt the second-hand value of old diesels. Problems implementing new, tougher pollution tests. Manufacturers were forced to halt some production while they got their models approved under the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure. Diesel sales took a huge hit, down almost 30%, while alternatively fuelled vehicles grew their market share from 4.6% to 6%. Here\u2019s our full story: We also have fresh signs that UK companies are triggering contingency plans, Luxury carmaker Aston Martin has committed to flying parts into the UK, to minimise the damage caused by a no-deal Brexit. Bikemaker Brompton has stockpiled \u00a31m worth of spare parts, to ensure it can keep making cycles. In the retail world: Discount chain Aldi has recorded its best weekly sales ever, as customers flocked for its high-end brands for Christmas. Home furnishings group Dunelm has beaten City forecasts, partly thanks to demand for Unicorn-themed items. Over in New York, Wall Street has opened a little higher. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 17 points, or 0.07%, to 23450 points - having surged by over 700 points on Friday. Fears that the US could be heading for a recession seem to be easing, after American firms hired rather more workers than expected last month. Fidelity International\u2019s Global Economist, Anna Stupnytska argues that the markets have over-reacted recently. She explains: The long-awaited US slowdown is finally appearing in the data and markets are convinced the Fed\u2019s hiking cycle is over. But with all the doom and gloom in the markets, it is easy to get carried away and fall into the \u2018recession\u2019 and \u2018rate cutting\u2019 camp. With the recent acceleration seen in real wages, markets may be over-reacting both with respect to near-term growth prospects and the Fed\u2019s reaction function. Brompton Bicycles, famous for their commuter-friendly folding models, are also stockpiling for Brexit. Brompton has built up a \u00a31m inventory of bike parts including wheel rims, spokes and steel, to prevent disruption from a hard Brexit. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: The foldable bike maker, which increased sales by 11% to \u00a336.1m in the year to March 2018, has rented a warehouse near Heathrow to store an extra month\u2019s worth of supplies in case imports of key items are held up by problems at ports if no deal is reached with the EU in the coming months. \u201cTaking storage [has cost us] \u00a350,000 but the implications of running out [of parts] could be \u00a350,000 in a few days,\u201d said Will Butler-Adams, the chief executive of the bike maker. It\u2019s shaping up to be a quiet start to trading on Wall Street, which will be welcome after the recent volatility. Labour MP Madeleine Moon argues that the slide in UK car sales last year shows the government must rule out leaving the EU without an agreement. Moon (part of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain campaign) \u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible to leave these businesses in the lurch by threatening to crash out of the EU with only 12 weeks to go before 29 March. Over the last two years, the automotive industry has been consistently unequivocal about the risks of no deal and the harm it could do to people\u2019s livelihoods and company profits. The Prime Minister has simply ignored these warnings. \u201cTheresa May should have ended the uncertainty months ago by immediately ruling out a no deal scenario to reassure businesses and the public.\u201d MPs are due to vote on the PM\u2019s withdrawal agreement next week, in the delayed \u2018meaningful vote\u2019. Many observers expect a heavy defeat for May, despite her attempts to win more concessions from European leaders. The latest word is that the EU has pledged to do its best to conclude trade talks with the UK by 2021, avoiding the whole of the UK being forced into a customs union by the Irish Backstop. Such an intention, however earnest and honest, isn\u2019t a legal guarantee, though, so it may not satisfy sceptical MPs.... Luxury UK carmaker Aston Martin has revealed that it has triggered some of its Brexit contingency plans. This includes flying some parts into the UK, and moving some of its road-based supply chain away from Dover, to avoid disruption caused by a no-deal Brexit. The company, based in Gaydon, Warwickshire, is also concerned about the lack of clarity around Brexit, with less than three months until the UK\u2019s departure date. Reuters has the details: Chief Executive Andy Palmer said the luxury automaker, which was in October considering plans to fly components and move more in through other ports, had no choice but to authorise such contingencies at a board meeting in December. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been in a position in the last two years where we\u2019ve been further apart from understanding where we\u2019re going to end up,\u201d Palmer told Reuters. \u201cWe programme a car to align and order all the parts for those cars twelve weeks in advance. You don\u2019t need to do the maths to know that therefore takes us across the Brexit period.\u201d \u201cWe have to prepare for the worst case scenario.\u201d Palmer also warned that Aston Marton\u2019s Brexit plans have added an \u201caccumulating cost\u201d. That will worry investors, who have already seen its share price fall from \u00a319 when it floated last October to just \u00a312 today. More here. Back in the markets, the optimism that pushed shares higher on Friday afternoon appears to have faded. Most European indices are now in the red as traders\u2019 minds turn to lunch: In London, the UK FTSE 100 down 40-odd points at 6795 - heading back towards the 28-month lows plumbed in late December. This takes the shine off the rally in Asia overnight, as traders caught up last Friday\u2019s strong US jobs report (and calming words from the head of America\u2019s Federal Reserve chief, Jay Powell). Sentiment may have been hurt by the unexpected slide in German factory orders (see 8.41am). The drop in UK car sales in 2018 won\u2019t have helped the mood either (although it wasn\u2019t a surprise). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The market\u2019s tentative grin turned into a grimace as Monday went on, investors unable to keep down the Asian optimism served up at breakfast. The FTSE, which already wasn\u2019t in a great mood soon after the bell, fell into a funk as lunchtime approached. With AstraZeneca, Standard Chartered, Reckitt Benckiser, BAT and Centrica in various states of red, and BP and Shell ignoring Brent Crude\u2019s 2.3% bounce, the UK index tumbled more than 40 points, slumping back under 6800 in the process. Investors are now looking for signs of progress in the US-China trade negotiations, which resumed today. Brexit means Britain\u2019s car industry faces \u201cextremely challenging times\u201d, warns Richard Gane, director and automotive specialist at management consultancy, Vendigital. Gane explains: In an uncertain trading climate, where costs are increasing and demand is nosediving, they are expected to keep investing in technologies and skills to enhance the viability of all-electric and autonomous driving. The supply chain is taking the brunt of the immediate pressure in terms of stockpiling inventory and the next few months are going to critical. A cliff-edge scenario could force manufacturers to implement more temporary closures or production holidays and it could take up to six months to burn off excess stock in a market facing declining demand.\u201d Sales of UK vans slumped by 8.8% last month, new figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show. That means van sales shrank by 1.3% during 2018 as a whole - a smaller decline than the 6.8 drop in car sales, but still disappointing for the sector. SMMT CEO Mike Hawes fears that it shows businesses are too nervous about Brexit to invest in new vehicles. \u201cThis sector is a key indicator of business confidence in the UK, and operators need stability to renew their fleets. December\u2019s performance was worrying, as was the overall drop in fleet purchases. Business confidence depends on government providing the right conditions, which first and foremost means taking a \u2018No Deal\u2019 Brexit off the table. We have a strong and competitive commercial vehicle market in the UK, one that can flourish in the right economic climate.\u201d Economist Howard Archer of the EY Item Club fears that UK car sales will be weak this year too: Despite the recent improvement, consumer purchasing power is still relatively limited compared to past norms while confidence is currently fragile with particular caution over making major purchases. Indeed, GfK reported that consumer confidence in December was at the lowest level since July 2013. Meanwhile, with the savings ratio being very low, consumers may at the very least be keen to avoid further dissaving. The August rise in interest rates may have reinforced consumer caution. Furthermore, lenders have cut back on the availability of unsecured consumer credit. Car manufacturers have been particularly vociferous over the impact that a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit could have in disrupting their supply chains. Policymakers need to do more to support the car industry, especially with Brexit looming, argues Ian Gilmartin, Head of Retail &amp; Wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking. \u201cWe\u2019ve known for several months that the overall new car figure for 2018 would be significantly down on the 2017 result, so today\u2019s confirmation won\u2019t come as a surprise but should serve as a timely reminder to policymakers of the urgent need to support our car industry at its time of need. With no clarity on how the UK\u2019s departure from the EU will play out, it\u2019s no wonder that consumers are reluctant to splash out on big-ticket items such as a new car. Se\u00e1n Kemple, director of sales at Close Brothers Motor Finance, pins the blame for falling car sales on Brexit (along with the global economic slowdown, and confusion over fuel types following the diesel debacle). He explains: The last couple of months has seen \u00a3100bn wiped off the value of the world\u2019s biggest listed carmakers last year and car production slumping in the third quarter of 2018. \u201cBrexit is absolutely having an impact on consumer confidence, and we can see that in these car sales. The priority for now is to hope that the Government\u2019s withdrawal agreement delivers some clarity upon which we can start to move forward. However, we still have confusion in the market place from fuel types to finance options, which will continue to exist once Brexit is out the way. During this extended period of uncertainty, dealers are best placed to be a source of expertise and reassurance to customers. If they hope to bolster their bottom lines, they must seize this opportunity with both hands as we move into 2019.\u201d Ian Plummer, Auto Trader Director, reckons the car industry could get a boost in 2019 if the UK achieves a smooth Brexit (that\u2019s a big if, of course). Plummer explains: Brexit anxieties also cast a long shadow last year and will continue to do so beyond the UK\u2019s withdrawal of the EU. A \u2018no deal\u2019 will likely impact new car sales as poor exchange rates and potential tariffs could force brands to pass on the cost to consumers. However, a smooth Brexit resulting in stable exchange rates and trade agreements, would signal to manufacturers that the UK remains a positive growth market with good profit opportunities, ensuring both a healthy pipeline of new stock and some great deals for consumers. The slide in car sales was widespread, with individuals, companies and fleet managers all cutting back. The SMMT says: The biggest losses were felt in the fleet sector (down -7.3%), while private motorists and smaller business operators registered -6.4% and -5.6% fewer new cars respectively. While diesel sales slumped, sales of electric cars jumped by 20% last year - but still remain a small part of the market. More than 141,000 alternatively-fuelled vehicles were sold, up from almost 117,000 in 2017. That\u2019s a 6% share of total sales. Petrol electric hybrids remained the most popular choice, up +21.3% to 81,156 units. Sales of \u201cpure electric cars\u201d rose by 13.8%, but only make up 0.7% of the overall market (with 15,474 sold). The SMMT fears that growth is slowing, thanks to the government\u2019s controversial decision in October to lower, or scrap, grants for hybrid and electric vehicles. Given the reduction in government incentives, the pace of growth of plug-in cars is now falling significantly behind the EU average. It\u2019s official: UK car sales have fallen by the biggest amount since the days of the financial crisis. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has just reported that new registrations slumped by 6.8% last year, as anticipated earlier this morning, to 2,367,147 units. It\u2019s the second annual decline in a row, as this chart shows: That includes a 5.5% year-on-year drop in sales in December. Diesel sales crashed by 29.6% in 2018, as drivers were deterred from buying a new model (or trying to sell their old one) by the aftermath of Volkswagen\u2019s emissions scandal. The SMMT says the industry suffered \u201ca turbulent year\u201d, with consumer and business confidence falling (thanks, Brexit!), plus model changes, regulatory upheaval and continued anti-diesel policies. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, says: \u201cA second year of substantial decline is a major concern, as falling consumer confidence, confusing fiscal and policy messages and shortages due to regulatory changes have combined to create a highly turbulent market. The industry is facing ever-tougher environmental targets against a backdrop of political and economic uncertainty that is weakening demand so these figures should act as a wake-up call for policy makers. Supportive, not punitive measures are needed to grow sales, because replacing older cars with new technologies, whether diesel, petrol, hybrid or plug-in, is good for the environment, the consumer, the industry and the exchequer.\u201d More to follow.... We also have worrying economic news from Germany. German factory orders dropped by 1% month-on-month in November, the first monthly decline in four months. On an annual basis, orders were 4% lower than a year ago - suggesting trade war fears, Brexit, and the wider eurozone slowdown are all hurting Europe\u2019s latest economy. Britons aren\u2019t buying as many new cars...but they are buying more food from Aldi. The German discount supermarket chain has just recorded its busiest ever week, as shoppers splashed out on its premium offerings for Christmas. My colleague Rob Davies explains: Aldi sold nearly \u00a31bn of goods in the UK during December thanks to rising demand for its premium ranges, the discounter said on Monday. The German supermarket giant\u2019s British arm, the country\u2019s fifth-largest grocery chain, said the week beginning 17 December was the busiest in its history, with sales up 10% on last year. Aldi said its sales performance reflected a surge in demand for its premium ranges \u2013 Specially Selected and Exquisite. \u201cWe begin the new year with great momentum as the UK\u2019s fastest-growing supermarket and on the back of record Christmas sales,\u201d said the chief executive, Giles Hurley. The Financial Times agrees that the diesel emissions scandal has a serious impact on Uk car sales last year: Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said the drop was due to a combination of new emissions tests leading to supply bottlenecks, diesel drivers holding on to their cars for longer and low consumer confidence. \u201cBrexit is an issue,\u201d he said, but he added that it would be \u201cunfair to attribute [the decline] wholly to Brexit.\u201d He said Dieselgate \u2014 the scandal that revealed widespread cheating in emissions testing by manufacturers \u2014 was probably the most significant factor as it was the only category in which sales dropped. The Independent has highlighted the dangers posed by Brexit: The SMMT said that its members had spent some time examining what might happen under a disruptive no-deal Brexit, but many car imports are through specialist centres such as Immingham rather than the traditional cross-channel routes. There seems to be little sign, as yet, of consumers buying cars in advance of possible shortages, but the SMMT said that a first-quarter sales boost in 2019 was possible. It added that its members had not been stockpiling new vehicles. On the other hand, UK manufacturing operations have very little scope for warehousing new parts and any disruption to the 1,100 trucks a day coming to deliver parts to assembly lines across Britain would mean line stoppages, a rapid escalation in costs and a threat to future production and investment. Sky News points out: The SMMT, like other business bodies, is calling for MPs to back Theresa May\u2019s Brexit agreement and avoid a no-deal scenario. It says that crashing out of the EU without an agreement risked destroying the car manufacturing industry, which employs more than 850,000 people in the UK. The drop in car sales can be firmly pinned on the 2015 diesel emissions scandal, which exposed how Volkswagen has used \u2018cheat software\u2019 to hide how much pollution its cars were pumping out. This hurt demand for new diesel cars, and slashed the second-hand value of old diesels - making it harder to trade them in for a shiny new model. The scandal also prompted regulators to introduce a new tougher test, the Worldwide harmonised Light vehicles Test Procedure (or WLTP). It did a better job of simulating real-world driving conditions, making it harder for manufacturers to cheat. However, this also caused significant delays, as manufacturers have struggled to get their new models tested, and certified as compliant with WLTP. UK car sales have now fallen for two years running. The 7%-ish drop in 2018 follows a 5.7% drop in 2017. The head of the SMMT, Mike Hawes, fears that car sales could fall sharply again if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal. Hawes says is vital that a hard Brexit is avoided, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s still hard to see any upside to Brexit. \u201cEveryone recognises that Brexit is an existential threat to the UK automotive industry and we hope a practical solution will prevail.\u201d Reuters has more details. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A potent cocktail of threats have hit Britain\u2019s car industry in the last year, sending sales sliding at their fastest rate since the financial crisis. New car sales slumped by almost 7% in 2018, according to new data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, to around 2.37 vehicles. It blames a Brexit-induced slide in consumer confidence, the diesel emissions scandal and a new, more rigorous testing regime which has made it harder for European manufacturers to get models on the road. This is the biggest drop in car sales since 2008, when car sales slumped by over 11% in the aftermath of the financial crisis. It\u2019s the latest signal that the UK economy has weakened. The SMMT also predicts that sales will fall 2% in 2019, even on the assumption that Britain leaves the EU in March with a withdrawal agreement. The trade body has declined to estimate how car sales would perform in a no-deal scenario -- something the SMMT sees as a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d for the UK car industry (given its reliance on just-in-time supply chains, and the single market). The SMMT will release its final figures for 2018 at 9am GMT, so stay tuned. Also coming up today After some wild sessions recently, global stock markets are starting the new week in a better mood. Shares have risen in Asia, after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell tried to reassure investors - saying the Fed\u2019s interest rate policy is flexible and officials are \u201clistening carefully\u201d to financial markets. Britain\u2019s FTSE is expected to open a little higher too. The agenda 9am GMT: UK car registration figures for December 2018 9.30am GMT: Eurozone Sentix investor confidence report for January",

The latest symbol of wretched excess in the world of the Premier League is the \u00a3700 charged by West Ham to the parents of the children who walk out of the tunnel alongside their players before a major home match.</p> <p>What, you might have been forgiven for assuming, could be a better sign of the enduring connection between the top level of professional football and the innocent enthusiasm of children in the early stages of forming a bond with the game than the practice of inviting some of them to hold hands with players of worldwide renown and stratospheric earning power as they make their way on to the pitch? The players get some brief contact with the real world. For the children, there is a precious glimpse of the stadium from their heroes\u2019 point of view, filled with noise and colour.</p> <p>The discovery that some Premier League clubs sell the experience of walking on to the pitch before a big match enraged Gary Lineker, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/1080399852679430145\" title=\"\">who tweeted</a>: \u201cThis is awful \u2013 dreadful avarice\u201d.

Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and the two Manchester clubs are among them. It\u2019s unlikely that Manchester City charged the sisters Vera Cohen and Olga Halon, aged 102 and 97 respectively, for accompanying the team on to the pitch before the match against Fulham last September. They were accompanied by Vera\u2019s great-grandsons, Max and Sammy Goldsmith, aged 10 and four, in one of the most memorable moments of the season.</p> <p>But plenty of others do. At Tottenham, where Daniel Levy drives such hard transfer bargains and is trying to persuade the local council <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/22/london-streets-too-dirty-claim-super-rich-spurs\" title=\"\">to pay for cleaning up the neighbourhood</a> before the opening of his shiny new stadium, the top charge is \u00a3405. That\u2019s another of Lineker\u2019s old clubs. But at a third, Everton, no money is involved.

      "bodyText": "You can keep your prawn sandwiches, your camo-wrapped Bentleys and even the in-stadium fromagerie at the new White Hart Lane. The latest symbol of wretched excess in the world of the Premier League is the \u00a3700 charged by West Ham to the parents of the children who walk out of the tunnel alongside their players before a major home match. What, you might have been forgiven for assuming, could be a better sign of the enduring connection between the top level of professional football and the innocent enthusiasm of children in the early stages of forming a bond with the game than the practice of inviting some of them to hold hands with players of worldwide renown and stratospheric earning power as they make their way on to the pitch? The players get some brief contact with the real world. For the children, there is a precious glimpse of the stadium from their heroes\u2019 point of view, filled with noise and colour. The discovery that some Premier League clubs sell the experience of walking on to the pitch before a big match enraged Gary Lineker, who tweeted: \u201cThis is awful \u2013 dreadful avarice\u201d. He was right, and it will not have escaped his attention that Leicester, his home town club, where he started out and retains his affections, also charge mascots. True, they ask less than the \u00a3700 demanded by West Ham. Still, their fee is \u00a3600, which might put a bit of a dent in the image fostered since their miraculous title-winning season under a benevolent ownership. Some clubs, including some of the very biggest, make no charge for the privilege of being a mascot. Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and the two Manchester clubs are among them. It\u2019s unlikely that Manchester City charged the sisters Vera Cohen and Olga Halon, aged 102 and 97 respectively, for accompanying the team on to the pitch before the match against Fulham last September. They were accompanied by Vera\u2019s great-grandsons, Max and Sammy Goldsmith, aged 10 and four, in one of the most memorable moments of the season. But plenty of others do. At Tottenham, where Daniel Levy drives such hard transfer bargains and is trying to persuade the local council to pay for cleaning up the neighbourhood before the opening of his shiny new stadium, the top charge is \u00a3405. That\u2019s another of Lineker\u2019s old clubs. But at a third, Everton, no money is involved. Mascots aged between five and 12 are chosen at random from members of a junior scheme and season-ticket holders. Across Stanley Park at Anfield, they are similarly selected from junior members and charity requests, without charge. That, surely, is the way to do it. In the case of West Ham, the nasty taste left by the news of the \u00a3700 charge was worsened to the point of nausea by a story that broke on the same day, about a sum of money paid to their vice-chairman, Karren Brady.

Byrne is an unassuming performer but his glee in the sonic potential of his instrument is infectious; he was mesmerising building up a Tudor consort work line by line, the music changing shape with each addition.

      "bodyText": "Until 2017, when they were running the London (formerly Lufthansa) festival of baroque music, Lindsay Kemp and Lucy Bending never had to worry about a performer\u2019s laptop hooking up properly to the sequencer pedal. But since they established Baroque at the Edge, they deal with musicians who bring electronics, prepared pianos, folk instruments and more into the mix. This weekend-long festival mines a fertile seam, inviting experimentally minded performers to take 17th- or 18th-century music and run with it into the present day. For some this is their stock in trade. Viol player Liam Byrne has inspired many new works for his old instrument; spotlit next to his laptop in LSO St Luke\u2019s, he showcased several in his afternoon concert. Composers included Nico Muhly, Edmund Finnis, Alex Mills, whose Suspensions and Solutions created hulks of sound through different reverb processes, and Samuel Milea, whose Unvoiced examines dementia in the way its phrases move in and out of lucidity. Byrne is an unassuming performer but his glee in the sonic potential of his instrument is infectious; he was mesmerising building up a Tudor consort work line by line, the music changing shape with each addition. His unamplified playing was just as spellbinding, especially in his encore, a gorgeous Vivace by Karl Friedrich Abel. Elicia Silverstein\u2019s earlier concert, in the ringing acoustic of St James, Clerkenwell, tapped the affinities between monsters of the baroque and modern repertoire for solo violin. As well as thoughtful Bach, there was a tautly plotted performance of Biber\u2019s huge \u201cGuardian Angel\u201d Passacaglia, and Sciarrino\u2019s gauzy, scurrying Caprice No 2. Capping everything was Berio\u2019s colossal Sequenza No 8, in which Silverstein\u2019s control of the two distinct lines made it seem we were listening to two violinists. Back in St Luke\u2019s in the late-night slot, soprano Nora Fischer sang baroque and Renaissance laments by Monteverdi, Purcell, Barbara Strozzi and others.

      "body": "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/dec/18/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">of your comments and photos </a>from the last two weeks, just a small selection from the bumper crop of end of year lists that you\u2019ve posted over the holiday period. The breadth and depth of reading on display has been most impressive. Plenty of wisdom has also been garnered from those books, as <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16438100\">Rick2016 </a>demonstrates:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of the 45 books I read this year (which most people think is a lot but pales in comparison to many of the people in this forest!), the standouts were the following (roughly in order):</p> <p>Vikram Seth - <em>A Suitable Boy</em><br>Richard Powers - <em>The Overstory</em><br>David Park - <em>Travelling in a Strange Land</em><br>Graham Greene - <em>The Quiet American</em><br>Margaret Atwood - <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em><br>JL Carr - <em>A Month in the Country</em><br>John le Carr\u00e9 - <em>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</em><br>Somerset Maugham - <em>Of Human Bondage</em><br>Lima Barreto - <em>The Sad End of Policarpo Quaresma</em><br>Edward St Aubyn - <em>Never Mind</em><br>Tatiana Salem Levy - <em>The House at Smyrna</em><br>Penelope Lively - <em>Moon Tiger</em></p> <p>Looking at my reading this year, I learned three things:</p> <p>1. It\u2019s good to make the time to read those long novels that I keep meaning to read. Some, like <em>A Suitable Boy </em>would have been worth it if they had been twice as long.<br>2. Having a perception of an author\u2019s style through hearsay, or even reading only one of their books, isn\u2019t the same as actually reading them properly. Greene, le Carr\u00e9, Atwood, Dickens and others turned out to be far richer experiences than I expected.<br>3. TLS is an absolute goldmine for recommendations. I knew that already but there are several books that I loved this year that I would never have read if it weren\u2019t for you folks\u2019 advocacy. So thank you so much.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here\u2019s another 2018 summary, from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14992181\">interwar</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Putting together my annual list was a great reminder of so many hours well spent. My 20 \u2018most rewarding reads\u2019 of 2018 include fiction only, and I\u2019m well aware that some of my choices directly contradict others\u2019 judgements. Note that by \u2018most rewarding\u2019 I don\u2019t necessarily mean most enjoyable. Mostly these were books that made me think and stretched my imagination.</p> <p>Four were re-reads:<br>Wilkie Collins, <em>The Moonstone</em><br>E M Forster, <em>A Passage to India</em><br>R K Narayan, <em>The World of Nagaraj</em><br>Oscar Wilde, <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em></p> <p>Ten were translations:<br>Shusako Endo, <em>Volcano</em><br>Wolfgang Hilbig, <em>Old Rendering Plant</em><br>Ismaiil Kadare, <em>The Traitor\u2019s Niche</em><br>Walter Kempowski, <em>Homeland</em><br>Laszlo Krasznahorkai, <em>The World Goes On</em><br>Ayiyujo Nosaka, <em>The Cake Tree in the Ruins</em><br>Orhan Pamuk, <em>Snow</em><br>Ahmed Saadawi, <em>Frankenstein in Baghdad</em><br>Jose Saramago, <em>The Elephant\u2019s Journey</em><br>Mario Vargas Llosa, <em>The Storyteller</em></p> <p>And the rest:<br>Elizabeth Bowen, <em>The Last September</em><br>Roland Camberton, <em>Rain on the Pavements</em><br>Gabriel Jiosipovicii, <em>The Cemetery in Barnes</em><br>Philip Larkin, <em>A Girl in Winter</em><br>William Maxwell, <em>The Folded Leaf</em><br>Alex Pheby, <em>Lucia</em></p> </blockquote> <p>I could have included dozens more lists of similar quality \u2013 although. it should also be said that plenty of contributors didn\u2019t catalogue their reading or didn\u2019t read quite such vast numbers of books. One of the great things about TLS is that it takes all sorts \u2013 and all are welcome. On that note, I also enjoyed these spy and crime recommendations from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10840870\">beerbart</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I got the Xmas present that I wanted, the latest Ben Macintyre<em> The Spy and The Traitor</em>. My love for his work can only continue as this is another top class non-fiction thriller brimming with interesting facts from the late Cold War. However, being hardback, it is far too big on my commute. So I have a Maigret mystery in the bag, <em>Maigret and the Minister </em>which I\u2019m rifling through. I mainly read these for the unique atmosphere Simenon invokes. I also have another part of Deighton\u2019s Samson series on the go via Audio. <em>Spy Hook</em>. I\u2019m not yet in love with this series but I\u2019m too invested in the characters to drop out.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3962800\">dothebathosphere </a>has already finished their book of 2019: The Faint-hearted Bolshevik by Lorenzo Silva:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s a \u201cpunk\u201d book, the first sentence has the narrator describing his soul being located in his nether regions and it pretty much stays in that register. The narrator seeks revenge on a woman who he ran into the back of at a traffic light.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from the last two weeks, just a small selection from the bumper crop of end of year lists that you\u2019ve posted over the holiday period. The breadth and depth of reading on display has been most impressive. Plenty of wisdom has also been garnered from those books, as Rick2016 demonstrates: Of the 45 books I read this year (which most people think is a lot but pales in comparison to many of the people in this forest!), the standouts were the following (roughly in order): Vikram Seth - A Suitable Boy Richard Powers - The Overstory David Park - Travelling in a Strange Land Graham Greene - The Quiet American Margaret Atwood - The Handmaid\u2019s Tale JL Carr - A Month in the Country John le Carr\u00e9 - The Spy Who Came in from the Cold Somerset Maugham - Of Human Bondage Lima Barreto - The Sad End of Policarpo Quaresma Edward St Aubyn - Never Mind Tatiana Salem Levy - The House at Smyrna Penelope Lively - Moon Tiger Looking at my reading this year, I learned three things: 1. It\u2019s good to make the time to read those long novels that I keep meaning to read. Some, like A Suitable Boy would have been worth it if they had been twice as long. 2. Having a perception of an author\u2019s style through hearsay, or even reading only one of their books, isn\u2019t the same as actually reading them properly. Greene, le Carr\u00e9, Atwood, Dickens and others turned out to be far richer experiences than I expected. 3. TLS is an absolute goldmine for recommendations. I knew that already but there are several books that I loved this year that I would never have read if it weren\u2019t for you folks\u2019 advocacy. So thank you so much. Here\u2019s another 2018 summary, from interwar: Putting together my annual list was a great reminder of so many hours well spent. My 20 \u2018most rewarding reads\u2019 of 2018 include fiction only, and I\u2019m well aware that some of my choices directly contradict others\u2019 judgements. Note that by \u2018most rewarding\u2019 I don\u2019t necessarily mean most enjoyable. Mostly these were books that made me think and stretched my imagination. Four were re-reads: Wilkie Collins, The Moonstone E M Forster, A Passage to India R K Narayan, The World of Nagaraj Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray Ten were translations: Shusako Endo, Volcano Wolfgang Hilbig, Old Rendering Plant Ismaiil Kadare, The Traitor\u2019s Niche Walter Kempowski, Homeland Laszlo Krasznahorkai, The World Goes On Ayiyujo Nosaka, The Cake Tree in the Ruins Orhan Pamuk, Snow Ahmed Saadawi, Frankenstein in Baghdad Jose Saramago, The Elephant\u2019s Journey Mario Vargas Llosa, The Storyteller And the rest: Elizabeth Bowen, The Last September Roland Camberton, Rain on the Pavements Gabriel Jiosipovicii, The Cemetery in Barnes Philip Larkin, A Girl in Winter William Maxwell, The Folded Leaf Alex Pheby, Lucia I could have included dozens more lists of similar quality \u2013 although. it should also be said that plenty of contributors didn\u2019t catalogue their reading or didn\u2019t read quite such vast numbers of books. One of the great things about TLS is that it takes all sorts \u2013 and all are welcome. On that note, I also enjoyed these spy and crime recommendations from beerbart: I got the Xmas present that I wanted, the latest Ben Macintyre The Spy and The Traitor. My love for his work can only continue as this is another top class non-fiction thriller brimming with interesting facts from the late Cold War. However, being hardback, it is far too big on my commute. So I have a Maigret mystery in the bag, Maigret and the Minister which I\u2019m rifling through. I mainly read these for the unique atmosphere Simenon invokes. I also have another part of Deighton\u2019s Samson series on the go via Audio. Spy Hook. I\u2019m not yet in love with this series but I\u2019m too invested in the characters to drop out. Meanwhile, dothebathosphere has already finished their book of 2019: The Faint-hearted Bolshevik by Lorenzo Silva: It\u2019s a \u201cpunk\u201d book, the first sentence has the narrator describing his soul being located in his nether regions and it pretty much stays in that register. The narrator seeks revenge on a woman who he ran into the back of at a traffic light. He starts with prank calls and stalking but then sets eyes on the woman\u2019s 15-year-old sister, revenge is off the table the narrator sets his mind to being a \u201cchild abuser\u201d. (I use quotes only because he has second thoughts in the course of his lechery before he\u2019s tried anything physical). Well, the book is both repellent and very funny. It\u2019s a cult hit in Spain and astonishingly often recommended to pupils as secondary school reading. Ellie Rose has also just \u201cdevoured\u201d Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman: I started reading it on the train, walked around my house reading it, made dinner reading it (the meal suffered slightly, I must admit) and finally finished it about 9pm, feeling like I\u2019d taken a punch to the gut. I found it unbearably sad, but darkly funny too, and sweet and overall very human. As a first read for 2019, it augurs good things for the year, I think! Finally, a challenge from vermontlogger following a \u201cre-re-reading\u201d of Charles Dickens\u2019 Great Expectations: I thought I would just read the first chapter or two. Then of course there was no stopping. No matter how well we know the story, Dickens\u2019 writing is irresistibly vivid and inventive \u2013 and is there any other book that can make you laugh and tear up on the same page? I can think of a few government policy documents that have made me feel that way, but that\u2019s maybe not the same thing. Any better suggestions?

Prediction is dangerous: but \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d may well prove a classic. So said CS Lewis in his 1937 review of JRR Tolkien\u2019s first novel. A Nora Ephron reading list.

The lessons focus on giving children strategies for getting to sleep and raising awareness about how sleep needs change in adolescence. A recent paper in the British Medical Journal suggested that sleep has a greater impact on an adolescent\u2019s mental wellbeing than bullying, physical activity and screen time. Concern has also been raised about what has been described as the \u201chidden public health disaster\u201d of sleeplessness among young people. A Guardian analysis of data from NHS Digital, shows admissions with a primary diagnosis of sleep disorder among the under-17s has risen from 6,520 in 2012-13 to 9,429 last year despite falling overall for all ages from 29,511 to 29,184 in the same period. \u201cSleep issues are a huge problem \u2026 it\u2019s a hidden public health crisis,\u201d said Rachael Taylor, the founder of the Sleep Sanctuary. \u201cThere is a lot of sleep anxiety being diagnosed at the moment; it\u2019s a new area that we are looking at, dealing with more children who have anxiety and it is coming out in sleep issues.\u201d Experts say the increase in sleep problems is down to a combination of higher obesity levels, excessive use of social media before bedtime and a mental health crisis among young people.

      "body": "<h2><strong>What is the NHS l</strong><strong>ong-t</strong><strong>erm p</strong><strong>lan about</strong>?</h2> <p>The NHS does not have enough money to keep doing what it does, treating the growing number of sick and often elderly people, many of whom live in the less well-off communities of the country. The organisation\u2019s chief executive, Simon Stevens, last year played a brilliantly strategic Brexit card (citing referendum promises that EU money would go to the NHS instead) and managed to extract a tidy sum from the government to stop the gaps and improve its functioning \u2013 in comparison with what other departments are getting. But \u00a320.5bn by 2023-24 will not transform the creakingly overloaded health service. The Long-term plan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/07/long-term-plan-for-nhs-england-undeliverable-amid-staffing-crisis\">published on Monday</a>, and part of a deal with the government to end the political clamour about the overloaded NHS, is about doing more with less.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/07/long-term-plan-for-nhs-england-undeliverable-amid-staffing-crisis\">Long-term plan for NHS England 'undeliverable' amid staffing crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>How is that possible?</strong></h2> <p>By stopping people getting sick in the first place. The central thrust of the plan is to keep people well and to pick it up really early if they get ill, because it\u2019s far cheaper to treat cancer or heart disease before it\u2019s progressed. The focus has to be on primary care \u2013 picking up problems at the GP surgery \u2013 and supporting people to improve their own health, for instance, by stopping smoking or taking more exercise.</p> <h2><strong>So what\u2019s the promise?</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s a big one \u2013 to save up to half a million lives. The subtext is that it will save the NHS a lot of money. The plan will \u201cprevent 150,000 heart attacks, strokes and dementia cases while more than 3 million people will benefit from new and improved stroke, respiratory and cardiac services over the next decade\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>How does the NHS intend to do that?</strong></h2> <p>There is excited talk of new technology. The NHS will open a digital \u201cfront door\u201d. Consulting a GP online will save her time and yours \u2013 and encourage more people with potential problems to get checked out. Stevens will be hoping it cuts the numbers heading for A&amp;E because they can\u2019t immediately get to see a GP. Digital consultations, plus rethinking the support given to those arriving at A&amp;E so they are channelled to the urgent care centre or somewhere more appropriate to their needs will save 30m trips to hospital and \u00a31bn, says the plan.</p> <p>There will be genetic testing to find people at risk of dangerously high cholesterol levels that could lead to heart disease and strokes. Children will get access to mental health support in schools, in the hope of preventing depression and anxiety escalating into adulthood. Mental health issues will be investigated when people have physical health problems too. There will be a big emphasis on diagnostics and testing to pick up cancer early. Smart inhalers will be given to asthma patients.</p> <h2><strong>But what about obesity-related diseases, such as type-2 diabetes, which are said to be crippling the NHS?</strong></h2> <p>The NHS is going to fund prevention programmes for obesity and smoking, and promote its already successful weight-loss support for people with type-2 diabetes. It\u2019s not the NHS\u2019s responsibility alone, it points out \u2013 but it interacts with 1 million people a day who are sick and may be at a moment in their lives when they will rethink what they are doing about their health. And they pick up the pieces. Obesity causes heart disease and cancers, as well as type-2 diabetes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/07/nhs-chief-backs-call-for-tougher-faster-ae-waiting-time-standards\">NHS chief backs call for tougher, faster A&amp;E waiting-time standards</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Is that going to be enough to sort out the pressures on the NHS?</strong></h2> <p>Not at all. The NHS is being squeezed by the convergence of several intractable problems. Obesity, caused by poor diet and inactivity, is one of them. The growing numbers of frail and elderly people who are in and out of hospital \u2013 and can\u2019t be moved out because there is no social care package for them \u2013 is another.</p> <h2><strong>But there is more money?</strong></h2> <p>That money is for the NHS. Local authorities have been crying in pain for some time, because they are responsible for public health programmes on obesity, smoking cessation and alcohol, as well as myriad other vital services and they are not getting enough cash. The NHS plan will help by its focus on supporting people at their GP practice and in their community to adopt healthier behaviour. Money from NHS England will be directed to areas on the basis of their local needs, in a bid to tackle health inequalities. The poorest in society are the sickest. But the NHS cannot sort this alone.</p> <p>The other hugely difficult area is social care for the elderly. Everybody knows it is vital that it is sorted out and it will take a lot of money. The NHS is in jeopardy until that happens.</p> <h2><strong>Is this p</strong><strong>lan just a sticking plaster?</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s much more than that. Stevens is attempting a gradual transformation of the NHS \u2013 a tightening up and smartening up. New ideas have been trialled in a few areas of the country as \u201cvanguard\u201d projects and those that work are extended. He wants to dump the Lansley free market reforms. The plan calls for legislation to \u201ccreate publicly accountable integrated care locally; to streamline the national administrative structures of the NHS; and remove the overly rigid competition and procurement regime applied to the NHS\u201d, it says.</p> <p>But the biggest problem, worsened by Brexit, will be staffing. The plan talks of taking the pressure off staff in A&amp;E and hospitals generally. Online consultations will be expected to help GPs, too. But there will still be rising numbers of elderly people and a need for treatment, which is costly and really requires an expanding workforce. The nursing shortage, especially, will bite and the plan proposes support to train more. But the workforce issues are unlikely to go away.</p>",

The NHS does not have enough money to keep doing what it does, treating the growing number of sick and often elderly people, many of whom live in the less well-off communities of the country. The organisation\u2019s chief executive, Simon Stevens, last year played a brilliantly strategic Brexit card (citing referendum promises that EU money would go to the NHS instead) and managed to extract a tidy sum from the government to stop the gaps and improve its functioning \u2013 in comparison with what other departments are getting. But \u00a320.5bn by 2023-24 will not transform the creakingly overloaded health service. The Long-term plan, published on Monday, and part of a deal with the government to end the political clamour about the overloaded NHS, is about doing more with less. How is that possible? By stopping people getting sick in the first place. The central thrust of the plan is to keep people well and to pick it up really early if they get ill, because it\u2019s far cheaper to treat cancer or heart disease before it\u2019s progressed. The focus has to be on primary care \u2013 picking up problems at the GP surgery \u2013 and supporting people to improve their own health, for instance, by stopping smoking or taking more exercise. So what\u2019s the promise? It\u2019s a big one \u2013 to save up to half a million lives. The subtext is that it will save the NHS a lot of money. The plan will \u201cprevent 150,000 heart attacks, strokes and dementia cases while more than 3 million people will benefit from new and improved stroke, respiratory and cardiac services over the next decade\u201d. How does the NHS intend to do that? There is excited talk of new technology. The NHS will open a digital \u201cfront door\u201d. Consulting a GP online will save her time and yours \u2013 and encourage more people with potential problems to get checked out. Stevens will be hoping it cuts the numbers heading for A&amp;E because they can\u2019t immediately get to see a GP. Digital consultations, plus rethinking the support given to those arriving at A&amp;E so they are channelled to the urgent care centre or somewhere more appropriate to their needs will save 30m trips to hospital and \u00a31bn, says the plan. There will be genetic testing to find people at risk of dangerously high cholesterol levels that could lead to heart disease and strokes. Children will get access to mental health support in schools, in the hope of preventing depression and anxiety escalating into adulthood. Mental health issues will be investigated when people have physical health problems too. There will be a big emphasis on diagnostics and testing to pick up cancer early. Smart inhalers will be given to asthma patients. But what about obesity-related diseases, such as type-2 diabetes, which are said to be crippling the NHS? The NHS is going to fund prevention programmes for obesity and smoking, and promote its already successful weight-loss support for people with type-2 diabetes. It\u2019s not the NHS\u2019s responsibility alone, it points out \u2013 but it interacts with 1 million people a day who are sick and may be at a moment in their lives when they will rethink what they are doing about their health. And they pick up the pieces. Obesity causes heart disease and cancers, as well as type-2 diabetes. Is that going to be enough to sort out the pressures on the NHS? Not at all. The NHS is being squeezed by the convergence of several intractable problems. Obesity, caused by poor diet and inactivity, is one of them. The growing numbers of frail and elderly people who are in and out of hospital \u2013 and can\u2019t be moved out because there is no social care package for them \u2013 is another. But there is more money? That money is for the NHS. Local authorities have been crying in pain for some time, because they are responsible for public health programmes on obesity, smoking cessation and alcohol, as well as myriad other vital services and they are not getting enough cash. The NHS plan will help by its focus on supporting people at their GP practice and in their community to adopt healthier behaviour. Money from NHS England will be directed to areas on the basis of their local needs, in a bid to tackle health inequalities. The poorest in society are the sickest. But the NHS cannot sort this alone. The other hugely difficult area is social care for the elderly. Everybody knows it is vital that it is sorted out and it will take a lot of money. The NHS is in jeopardy until that happens. Is this plan just a sticking plaster? It\u2019s much more than that. Stevens is attempting a gradual transformation of the NHS \u2013 a tightening up and smartening up. New ideas have been trialled in a few areas of the country as \u201cvanguard\u201d projects and those that work are extended. He wants to dump the Lansley free market reforms. The plan calls for legislation to \u201ccreate publicly accountable integrated care locally; to streamline the national administrative structures of the NHS; and remove the overly rigid competition and procurement regime applied to the NHS\u201d, it says. But the biggest problem, worsened by Brexit, will be staffing. The plan talks of taking the pressure off staff in A&amp;E and hospitals generally. Online consultations will be expected to help GPs, too. But there will still be rising numbers of elderly people and a need for treatment, which is costly and really requires an expanding workforce. The nursing shortage, especially, will bite and the plan proposes support to train more. But the workforce issues are unlikely to go away.",

      "bodyText": "The Gabonese government has put down a coup attempt after a group of soldiers briefly took over state radio and broadcast a statement calling on people to \u201crise up\u201d while the president, Ali Bongo, is in Morocco recovering from a stroke. Authorities have regained control of the state broadcasting offices and a major thoroughfare in the capital, Libreville, which were the only areas taken by the plotters, the government spokesman Guy-Bertrand Mapangou told Radio France International. At 4.30am (0530 GMT) on Monday a man identifying himself as Lt Kelly Ondo Obiang read out a message on state radio that was simultaneously filmed for social media. Obiang was flanked by two armed men, all in the uniform and green berets of the powerful Republican Guard, which is usually tasked with protecting the president. \u201cThe eagerly awaited day has arrived when the army has decided to put itself on the side of the people in order to save Gabon from chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are eating, stop; if you are having a drink, stop; if you are sleeping, wake up. Wake up your neighbours \u2026 rise up as one and take control of the street,\u201d he added, calling on Gabonese to occupy the country\u2019s airports, public buildings and media organisations. A witness told Reuters a crowd of about 300 people had gathered in support of the attempted coup at the state broadcasting headquarters, where the military fired teargas to disperse them. The Bongo family has ruled Gabon since 1967, except for four months in 2009 after Ali Bongo\u2019s father, Omar, died. Four of the five plotters were taken into custody on Monday morning, Mapangou told France 24. The fifth was caught in the afternoon, reportedly hiding under a bed in a house. \u201cThe government is in place. The institutions are in place,\u201d Mapangou said. The communications minister said the men were \u201ca group of jokers and the military hierarchy does not recognise them\u201d. Moussa Faki Mahamat, the chair of the African Union, said he strongly condemned the coup attempt. A spokeswoman for the French foreign ministry also criticised the action in its former colony. \u201cGabon\u2019s stability can only be ensured in strict compliance with the provisions of its constitution,\u201d she said. Bongo became ill in October while on a visit to Saudi Arabia. Rather than going home, he went to recuperate in Morocco, from where he gave a New Year\u2019s Day statement in which he admitted he had been \u201cthrough a difficult period, as sometimes happens in life\u201d. He said he was preparing to return home soon. Obiang said Bongo\u2019s speech, in which he slurred some words and appeared unable to move his right arm, had \u201creinforced doubts about the president\u2019s ability to continue to carry out the responsibilities of his office\u201d. Omar Bongo squandered much of Gabon\u2019s vast oil wealth and kept close ties with France in a system known as Fran\u00e7afrique. Ali Bongo tried to set himself apart from his father but lost any moral high ground at the last presidential vote. He was the beneficiary of an election in 2016 that was widely acknowledged to have been rigged amid violence from the country\u2019s security forces. Ostensibly he won 49.8% of the vote to his rival Jean Ping\u2019s 48.23%. Ping had looked set to win until results from Haut-Ogoou\u00e9, Bongo\u2019s home region, were announced. The electoral commission claimed a 99.98% turnout in Haut-Ogoou\u00e9, compared with 59% everywhere else, and said 95% of those who cast votes there did so for the president. The opposition accused the Republican Guard of bombing its headquarters in the aftermath. On Friday, Donald Trump sent 80 troops to Gabon to defend US interests and \u201cfurther foreign policy\u201d in the nearby Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the Catholic church has warned of an uprising if the result of an election on 30 December is not respected.",

      "body": "<h2>Nowadays (from Chicago)</h2> <p>Chicago is all about precision. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/oct/20/guardianobituaries.filmnews\">Gwen Verdon</a> and I did our duet Nowadays, playing Roxie and Velma, it was a case of two dancing as one. I never want to see a picture where either one of us has even a finger out of place performing it!</p> <p>I liked the desperateness of Velma. She\u2019s really an animal. She\u2019s tough but she meets her match in Roxie who at first appears sweetly adorable. Velma is not ashamed to go as low as she needs to get as high as she wants. The song comes towards the end. These two girls, who are opposites throughout the entire show, finally come together and become one.</p> <p>One of the lines goes: \u201cIn 50 years or so it\u2019s gonna change, you know, but oh, it\u2019s heaven nowadays.\u201d When I sing that bit today, I have to let the audience know that I know that almost 50 years have passed since I first sang it \u2013 and that I\u2019ve changed. I\u2019m a different person now. It\u2019s fun to share that with the audience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b045911840345113314c62ce4deafddca23ce045\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b045911840345113314c62ce4deafddca23ce045/0_396_2986_1792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera in Chicago.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera in Chicago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martha Swope/The New York Public Library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>All That Jazz (Chicago)</h2> <p>With Velma and Roxie, we\u2019re talking about two killers who have the audacity to ask: \u201cWhatever happened to fair dealing and pure ethics?\u201d The show is still running because it\u2019s about human beings\u2019 capacity for survival.</p> <p>All That Jazz is typical of Kander and Ebb: it has a looseness, a raucousness, a \u201cbad girl\u201d kind of thing about it: throwing caution to the wind. I had moved to California when I got the call from Bob Fosse and I came back to New York to do it. To stand next to Gwen in the show was quite an honour. She was delicious. Redheads have a lightness, a craziness, a kookiness. Think of Lucille Ball. Gwen was sort of like that. She was a great gal, a jokester. We had so much fun together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b2b10f1c4eb609dd414668e7ab8a933f9ad738c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b2b10f1c4eb609dd414668e7ab8a933f9ad738c/0_76_2147_1516/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chita Rivera, left, as Anita, with Carol Lawrence as Maria in West Side Story at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York in 1957.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chita Rivera, left, as Anita, with Carol Lawrence as Maria in West Side Story at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York in 1957.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>A Boy Like That (West Side Story)</h2> <p>Somebody recently sent me some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/18/how-we-made-west-side-story-stephen-sondheim-chita-rivera-musicals\">West Side Story</a> photos that I\u2019d never seen before. It brings it all back. I feel as though I could call up any of those people and continue where we left off. It was a wonderful, joyous time. Even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2018/oct/11/jerome-robbins-choreographer-dancer-in-pictures-gallery\">Jerry Robbins</a> is smiling in the pictures. They always accused him of being a taskmaster, which of course he was. If he hadn\u2019t been, we never would have turned out the way we did.</p> <p>In my concert this month I\u2019ll be singing a medley of A Boy Like That and America. I\u2019m hoping to do a version of Somewhere, too. I did it at Carnegie Hall with a gay men\u2019s choir.</p> <p>A Boy Like That is the moment when Anita finally discovers that Maria is having an affair with the boy who has killed Anita\u2019s boyfriend and Maria\u2019s brother. Anita is part mother and part friend to Maria but mostly mother. I played Anita on Broadway and in London. I hadn\u2019t yet had a baby when I did the role in New York but when I did it in London I\u2019d had my daughter, Lisa, and she was there with me at the time so I felt an even more maternal feeling.</p> <h2>Love and Love Alone (The Visit)</h2> <p>In The Visit, on Broadway in 2015, I played Claire, who was once a very good girl and is betrayed by her lover and kicked out of town by a judge. She marries several men and becomes rich while the town becomes poor. Then she returns: she\u2019s bought up the judge, who is now her butler, and she comes back with an empty casket for her former lover.</p> <p>It is so dark but when you think about it, you go: \u201cServes him right!\u201d She\u2019s looking for the truth.

      "bodyText": "Nowadays (from Chicago) Chicago is all about precision. When Gwen Verdon and I did our duet Nowadays, playing Roxie and Velma, it was a case of two dancing as one. I never want to see a picture where either one of us has even a finger out of place performing it! I liked the desperateness of Velma. She\u2019s really an animal. She\u2019s tough but she meets her match in Roxie who at first appears sweetly adorable. Velma is not ashamed to go as low as she needs to get as high as she wants. The song comes towards the end. These two girls, who are opposites throughout the entire show, finally come together and become one. One of the lines goes: \u201cIn 50 years or so it\u2019s gonna change, you know, but oh, it\u2019s heaven nowadays.\u201d When I sing that bit today, I have to let the audience know that I know that almost 50 years have passed since I first sang it \u2013 and that I\u2019ve changed. I\u2019m a different person now. It\u2019s fun to share that with the audience. All That Jazz (Chicago) With Velma and Roxie, we\u2019re talking about two killers who have the audacity to ask: \u201cWhatever happened to fair dealing and pure ethics?\u201d The show is still running because it\u2019s about human beings\u2019 capacity for survival. All That Jazz is typical of Kander and Ebb: it has a looseness, a raucousness, a \u201cbad girl\u201d kind of thing about it: throwing caution to the wind. I had moved to California when I got the call from Bob Fosse and I came back to New York to do it. To stand next to Gwen in the show was quite an honour. She was delicious. Redheads have a lightness, a craziness, a kookiness. Think of Lucille Ball. Gwen was sort of like that. She was a great gal, a jokester. We had so much fun together. A Boy Like That (West Side Story) Somebody recently sent me some West Side Story photos that I\u2019d never seen before. It brings it all back. I feel as though I could call up any of those people and continue where we left off. It was a wonderful, joyous time. Even Jerry Robbins is smiling in the pictures. They always accused him of being a taskmaster, which of course he was. If he hadn\u2019t been, we never would have turned out the way we did. In my concert this month I\u2019ll be singing a medley of A Boy Like That and America. I\u2019m hoping to do a version of Somewhere, too. I did it at Carnegie Hall with a gay men\u2019s choir. A Boy Like That is the moment when Anita finally discovers that Maria is having an affair with the boy who has killed Anita\u2019s boyfriend and Maria\u2019s brother. Anita is part mother and part friend to Maria but mostly mother. I played Anita on Broadway and in London. I hadn\u2019t yet had a baby when I did the role in New York but when I did it in London I\u2019d had my daughter, Lisa, and she was there with me at the time so I felt an even more maternal feeling. Love and Love Alone (The Visit) In The Visit, on Broadway in 2015, I played Claire, who was once a very good girl and is betrayed by her lover and kicked out of town by a judge. She marries several men and becomes rich while the town becomes poor. Then she returns: she\u2019s bought up the judge, who is now her butler, and she comes back with an empty casket for her former lover. It is so dark but when you think about it, you go: \u201cServes him right!\u201d She\u2019s looking for the truth. She offers money for the people to help her and they all give it up. They sell their souls and kill him. This is a love story but a European one not a Disney one. This song is so haunting: \u201cWhen you\u2019re young, feeling oh so strong, what can prove you wrong? Love, and love alone.\u201d That\u2019s how deep her love for him was \u2013 and still is. Where Am I Going? (Sweet Charity) I had a glorious time playing Charity on tour around the US. Gwen Verdon had the role on Broadway. Anything that anybody else would make vulgar she could make funny and adorable and sexy. It\u2019s different from what happens today.

      "body": "<p>Caroline Lucas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/04/caroline-lucas-green-mp-meat-tax-oxford-farmers-conference-prioritise-sustainability\" title=\"\">called for a meat tax last week</a>, something the environment secretary, Michael Gove, has suggested is the worst example of a nanny state. He is wrong. The idea isn\u2019t authoritarian, it\u2019s regressive. Like other proposals to impose taxes on dangerous products to save people from themselves, it is well intentioned. But the inevitable consequence is that poor people will suffer.</p> <p>This is by no means an argument that meat is good for people, or even necessarily cheaper. Red meat is associated with a host of health issues <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/news/food-and-diet/could-red-and-processed-meat-tax-save-thousands-lives/\" title=\"\">such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes</a>, and chefs such as Jack Monroe have shown how people can eat healthy, vegan meals on a tight budget. But to incentivise behaviour by making things more expensive is to say that the rich can do whatever they please while the poor should go without. The weight of environmentally conscious decisions falls on those who can\u2019t afford to pay rather than on society as a whole. It\u2019s reverting to 18th-century rules: the poor can eat beans, while the rich eat meat. Choice becomes something only the rich deserve.</p> <p>Some (particularly neoliberals like Gove) speak of choice like some heroic character in a movie: good without anybody quite knowing why, never to be thwarted and capable of enacting huge changes \u2013 like fixing markets or curing crises. But there is another way of understanding choice: that people deserve the right to be trusted and to know what is best for themselves. It is the right to choose a \u00a31 chicken-and-chips box because it provides a valuable after-school meal for your child, knowing that it\u2019s the one you can afford; to choose it because it\u2019s cheap and it\u2019s fuel and it doesn\u2019t take time to make. It is the belief that wealthy people can\u2019t decide on behalf of the poor what is best for them, never mind to ask them to sacrifice for the good of everyone else.</p> <p>Many people do not understand the impact of the meat industry on the environment (did you know that eating beef every day is equivalent to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46459714\" title=\"\">taking eight return flights to Malaga in a year</a>?) \u2013 so a potentially good side-effect of taxing meat could be a change in attitudes. But if something is wrong in principle, it should be wrong for everybody, not just the poor. Lucas\u2019s proposal incentivises individuals to change their lifestyle to protect the environment. Such changes are, individually, massive: reducing meat and dairy consumption is the single biggest way a person can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth\" title=\"\">limit their impact on climate change</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/04/caroline-lucas-green-mp-meat-tax-oxford-farmers-conference-prioritise-sustainability\">Caroline Lucas urges parliament to 'seriously consider' tax on meat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And this focus on individual actions is understandable. It is easy to feel helpless in the face of the climate crisis because it requires changes on an epic level \u2013 a level that a recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\" title=\"\">described as unprecedented</a>.</p> <p>But it is also a way of focusing on the consumer rather than the huge corporations that seek to gain from the climate crisis. It directs the focus away from making big societal changes, from unethical practices such as factory farming and the profit-making companies producing meat on an unprecedented scale. It is the same tactic that has been proposed to limit the impact of plastic, which has resulted in little to no change in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2018/nov/14/the-plastics-conspiracy-who-blame-waste-crisis\" title=\"\">amount produced</a> \u2013 precisely because it is special interests that the government needs to curtail, rather than individual actions.</p> <p>The government is the most powerful lever society has to stand up to the big guys. Of course individuals should try to help to prevent climate disaster, but this needs to be coupled with broader changes \u2013 rules, regulations and restrictions on multinational companies involved in perpetuating the crisis. Without that, we\u2019re doomed to fail.</p> <p>\u2022 Poppy Noor is a Guardian journalist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Caroline Lucas called for a meat tax last week, something the environment secretary, Michael Gove, has suggested is the worst example of a nanny state. He is wrong. The idea isn\u2019t authoritarian, it\u2019s regressive. Like other proposals to impose taxes on dangerous products to save people from themselves, it is well intentioned. But the inevitable consequence is that poor people will suffer. This is by no means an argument that meat is good for people, or even necessarily cheaper. Red meat is associated with a host of health issues such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes, and chefs such as Jack Monroe have shown how people can eat healthy, vegan meals on a tight budget. But to incentivise behaviour by making things more expensive is to say that the rich can do whatever they please while the poor should go without. The weight of environmentally conscious decisions falls on those who can\u2019t afford to pay rather than on society as a whole. It\u2019s reverting to 18th-century rules: the poor can eat beans, while the rich eat meat. Choice becomes something only the rich deserve. Some (particularly neoliberals like Gove) speak of choice like some heroic character in a movie: good without anybody quite knowing why, never to be thwarted and capable of enacting huge changes \u2013 like fixing markets or curing crises. But there is another way of understanding choice: that people deserve the right to be trusted and to know what is best for themselves. It is the right to choose a \u00a31 chicken-and-chips box because it provides a valuable after-school meal for your child, knowing that it\u2019s the one you can afford; to choose it because it\u2019s cheap and it\u2019s fuel and it doesn\u2019t take time to make. It is the belief that wealthy people can\u2019t decide on behalf of the poor what is best for them, never mind to ask them to sacrifice for the good of everyone else. Many people do not understand the impact of the meat industry on the environment (did you know that eating beef every day is equivalent to taking eight return flights to Malaga in a year?) \u2013 so a potentially good side-effect of taxing meat could be a change in attitudes. But if something is wrong in principle, it should be wrong for everybody, not just the poor. Lucas\u2019s proposal incentivises individuals to change their lifestyle to protect the environment. Such changes are, individually, massive: reducing meat and dairy consumption is the single biggest way a person can limit their impact on climate change. And this focus on individual actions is understandable. It is easy to feel helpless in the face of the climate crisis because it requires changes on an epic level \u2013 a level that a recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report described as unprecedented. But it is also a way of focusing on the consumer rather than the huge corporations that seek to gain from the climate crisis. It directs the focus away from making big societal changes, from unethical practices such as factory farming and the profit-making companies producing meat on an unprecedented scale. It is the same tactic that has been proposed to limit the impact of plastic, which has resulted in little to no change in the amount produced \u2013 precisely because it is special interests that the government needs to curtail, rather than individual actions. The government is the most powerful lever society has to stand up to the big guys. Of course individuals should try to help to prevent climate disaster, but this needs to be coupled with broader changes \u2013 rules, regulations and restrictions on multinational companies involved in perpetuating the crisis. Without that, we\u2019re doomed to fail. \u2022 Poppy Noor is a Guardian journalist",

      "body": "<p>The sumptuous playmaking skills of the Serbian footballer Dragoslav \u0160ekularac were so eye-catching during the early 1960s that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/pele\" title=\"\">Pel\u00e9</a> once asked him whether he had actually been born in Brazil. Indeed \u201cthe Brazilian\u201d was one of \u0160ekularac\u2019s nicknames, and he was also called \u201cthe romantic\u201d and \u201cthe artist\u201d \u2013 sobriquets that reflected other-worldly talents in midfield that were showcased beautifully for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/red-star-belgrade\" title=\"\">Red Star Belgrade</a> and the Yugoslavia national team.</p> <p>That \u0160ekularac, who has died aged 81, never became a millionaire superstar like Pel\u00e9 was partly down to the fact that the former Yugoslavia\u2019s stringent rules would not allow him to leave the country for bigger and better things. But there were also times in his career \u2013 and he went on playing until he was almost 40 \u2013 when he was criticised variously for not making the best of his gifts, for a lack of team play, and for a woefully disrespectful attitude to officials.</p> <p>He had, for instance, been the salient star of the 1962 World Cup finals in Chile, where his brilliance on the ball and in its distribution was largely responsible for Yugoslavia reaching the semi-finals. But a few months later, in an all too typical piece of indiscipline, he attacked a referee when playing for Red Star, and was suspended for 18 months.</p> <p>The son of Bogosav \u0160ekularac, a lawyer, and his wife, Donka (nee Markovska), \u0160ekularac was born in \u0160tip, then in Yugoslavia and now part of the Republic of Macedonia, but the family moved to Belgrade within six months of his birth.</p> <p>His abilities as a footballer were evident from childhood; he said he could not remember a time when he was not kicking a ball of some kind, initially one made out of rags. \u0160eki, as he would soon be known, became entranced by the elegant football played by his local club, Red Star Belgrade, and at the age of 13 he went to their stadium for a trial. To his deep disappointment, he was told that he was too small.</p> <p>Later, he was spotted playing in the schoolyard and brought back to Red Star, where his progress through the junior teams was swift. In 1955, he made his debut for the senior side, and in the following year played his first match, in his customary role of inside-forward, for the national team.</p> <p>In 1956 he won a silver medal with Yugoslavia at the Melbourne Olympics and in 1958 he was a member of the talented side that thrashed England 5-0 on a hot afternoon in Belgrade. He was a pivotal player for his country in the World Cup finals that year in Sweden, where Yugoslavia failed to progress from the group stage only on goal difference. </p> <p>It was in the 1962 World Cup finals in Chile that \u0160ekularac reached his zenith, at once a gloriously elusive and constructive figure in a team that beat West Germany 1-0 in Santiago in the quarter-finals. They went down 3-1 to the Czechs in the semi-final, and 1-0 to the Chilean hosts in the third place match in Santiago. Throughout the tournament \u0160ekularac, who was deployed at inside right in a four-man midfield, was outstanding. Between 1956 and 1966, he won 41 caps for his country and scored six goals.</p> <p>Domestically \u0160ekularac won four Yugoslav championship winners medals at Red Star, with whom he also reached the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1957, when they were knocked out by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina\" title=\"\">Fiorentina</a>. But the terrible incident in 1962 when he struck the referee after being sent off for dissent in a league match, clouded his later years at the club. The Yugoslavian authorities allowed him to move abroad in 1966, and he ended his time with Red Star, for whom he had made 375 league appearances and scored 119 goals, to play for Karlsruhe in West Germany. </p> <p>After a season there he had a brief return to Belgrade to play for the OFK club and then in 1969 he went to Colombia before finally, in 1975, returning to Europe for a season with Paris FC.</p> <p>On retiring from active football he was for a short while coach of the Serbian White Eagles in Canada. As manager of Red Star Belgrade over the 1989-90 season, he took his old club to a domestic league and cup double. But his stormy temperament came to the fore again in December 1989 when, during a Uefa Cup match against Cologne, he tussled with stewards as they prevented him from approaching the referee.</p> <p>Another suspension followed and \u2013 in an era when Red Star were in any case habitually hiring and firing coaches on a yearly basis \u2013 he was relieved of his job at the end of the season.</p> <p>His last managerial post came in 2006, when the Serbian White Eagles, who had gone out of existence in 1980, were resurrected and appointed him as the first head coach of their new era. \u0160ekularac led them for one reasonably successful season before retiring.</p> <p> \u2022 Dragoslav \u0160ekularac, footballer and manager, born 8 November 1937; died 5 January 2019</p>",

      "bodyText": "The sumptuous playmaking skills of the Serbian footballer Dragoslav \u0160ekularac were so eye-catching during the early 1960s that Pel\u00e9 once asked him whether he had actually been born in Brazil. Indeed \u201cthe Brazilian\u201d was one of \u0160ekularac\u2019s nicknames, and he was also called \u201cthe romantic\u201d and \u201cthe artist\u201d \u2013 sobriquets that reflected other-worldly talents in midfield that were showcased beautifully for Red Star Belgrade and the Yugoslavia national team. That \u0160ekularac, who has died aged 81, never became a millionaire superstar like Pel\u00e9 was partly down to the fact that the former Yugoslavia\u2019s stringent rules would not allow him to leave the country for bigger and better things. But there were also times in his career \u2013 and he went on playing until he was almost 40 \u2013 when he was criticised variously for not making the best of his gifts, for a lack of team play, and for a woefully disrespectful attitude to officials. He had, for instance, been the salient star of the 1962 World Cup finals in Chile, where his brilliance on the ball and in its distribution was largely responsible for Yugoslavia reaching the semi-finals. But a few months later, in an all too typical piece of indiscipline, he attacked a referee when playing for Red Star, and was suspended for 18 months. The son of Bogosav \u0160ekularac, a lawyer, and his wife, Donka (nee Markovska), \u0160ekularac was born in \u0160tip, then in Yugoslavia and now part of the Republic of Macedonia, but the family moved to Belgrade within six months of his birth. His abilities as a footballer were evident from childhood; he said he could not remember a time when he was not kicking a ball of some kind, initially one made out of rags. \u0160eki, as he would soon be known, became entranced by the elegant football played by his local club, Red Star Belgrade, and at the age of 13 he went to their stadium for a trial. To his deep disappointment, he was told that he was too small. Later, he was spotted playing in the schoolyard and brought back to Red Star, where his progress through the junior teams was swift. In 1955, he made his debut for the senior side, and in the following year played his first match, in his customary role of inside-forward, for the national team. In 1956 he won a silver medal with Yugoslavia at the Melbourne Olympics and in 1958 he was a member of the talented side that thrashed England 5-0 on a hot afternoon in Belgrade. He was a pivotal player for his country in the World Cup finals that year in Sweden, where Yugoslavia failed to progress from the group stage only on goal difference. It was in the 1962 World Cup finals in Chile that \u0160ekularac reached his zenith, at once a gloriously elusive and constructive figure in a team that beat West Germany 1-0 in Santiago in the quarter-finals. They went down 3-1 to the Czechs in the semi-final, and 1-0 to the Chilean hosts in the third place match in Santiago. Throughout the tournament \u0160ekularac, who was deployed at inside right in a four-man midfield, was outstanding. Between 1956 and 1966, he won 41 caps for his country and scored six goals. Domestically \u0160ekularac won four Yugoslav championship winners medals at Red Star, with whom he also reached the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1957, when they were knocked out by Fiorentina. But the terrible incident in 1962 when he struck the referee after being sent off for dissent in a league match, clouded his later years at the club. The Yugoslavian authorities allowed him to move abroad in 1966, and he ended his time with Red Star, for whom he had made 375 league appearances and scored 119 goals, to play for Karlsruhe in West Germany. After a season there he had a brief return to Belgrade to play for the OFK club and then in 1969 he went to Colombia before finally, in 1975, returning to Europe for a season with Paris FC. On retiring from active football he was for a short while coach of the Serbian White Eagles in Canada. As manager of Red Star Belgrade over the 1989-90 season, he took his old club to a domestic league and cup double. But his stormy temperament came to the fore again in December 1989 when, during a Uefa Cup match against Cologne, he tussled with stewards as they prevented him from approaching the referee. Another suspension followed and \u2013 in an era when Red Star were in any case habitually hiring and firing coaches on a yearly basis \u2013 he was relieved of his job at the end of the season. His last managerial post came in 2006, when the Serbian White Eagles, who had gone out of existence in 1980, were resurrected and appointed him as the first head coach of their new era. \u0160ekularac led them for one reasonably successful season before retiring. \u2022 Dragoslav \u0160ekularac, footballer and manager, born 8 November 1937; died 5 January 2019",

Halep can now offer insight into her life in Bucharest.</p> <p>We meet at 9am and she chats cheerfully while we are driven to an indoor court on the outskirts of the city. I watch her practise for the Australian Open, which begins next week in the contrasting furnace of Melbourne, where Halep suffered so much last year. On the way to lunch, with Halep drained after playing hard for two hours, she finds pleasure in the simple fact she spent her first Christmas at home in 10 years.</p> <p>\u201cI dedicated myself 100%, so many years,\u201d Halep says. \u201cNow I\u2019ve won a grand slam and I start to enjoy life more. I like to go out, make friendships. I\u2019m more open. Before I won the French I was very focused.\u201d</p> <p>Halep now appears the opposite of a one-dimensional obsessive. Instead, as she reflects on the dedication needed to reach her goals, she talks expansively about physical trauma, psychological barriers, the role of her former coach Darren Cahill and the sweetness of victory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b9c36886d1375c8923bb38946deda6e285a1e417\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9c36886d1375c8923bb38946deda6e285a1e417/0_262_4453_2672/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simona Halep\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simona Halep returns to Sloane Stephen en route to winning the 2018 French Open title.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cahill will spend most of this year with his family in Australia and so Halep is currently without a coach. This unusual situation adds to the fascination as to whether, while returning from a back injury and exhaustion after her momentous 2018, she can become an even better player.</p> <p>\u201cI have the experience and that\u2019s why I decided to be alone for four months without a coach. I want to feel relaxed. I had a lot of pressure [last] year, from Romania, from the people around me, because everyone was talking about the grand slam title. It\u2019s just a sport but for me it was everything. That\u2019s why I suffered a little.\u201d</p> <p>Halep\u2019s psychological resolve has been tested but at last year\u2019s Australian Open she was subjected to a physical battering that meant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/28/australian-open-simona-halep-hospitalised-dehydration\" title=\"\">she was taken to hospital after her draining three-set defeat in the final</a> against Caroline Wozniacki. The entire tournament had been an ordeal. \u201cI have never played such a tough tournament and I hope I will not have to again,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a disaster. My mum was scared and she said I must never do that again because it was too much. It was a warning.\u201d</p> <p>She had twisted her ankle badly in the first round but struggled on to win that match and the next one before facing Lauren Davis. They played for three hours 45 minutes in searing heat, costing Davis some of her toenails, before Halep won 15-13 in the final set. \u201cThat was amazing,\u201d Halep says. \u201cShe played so well and had three match points. But I think I had more desire to win. That match meant a lot because mentally I was strong. I could stay so many hours on court.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Winning the French Open was the best moment I ever had. I was crying because it was huge.</p> <footer> <cite>Simona Halep</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Halep survived another epic in the semi-finals, saving two match points and beating Angelique Kerber 9-7 in the third set, where \u201cit felt like every point was 20 rallies because she\u2019s a very big fighter. I was proud of that tournament. I was not even upset after I lost to Caroline in the final. I gave everything. But there was no more energy at the end.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the final, we finished with the press around 10pm and they took me to doping control. At 2am I left because I couldn\u2019t [produce a urine sample] as I was dehydrated. They took my blood. At the hotel I started shaking and they got me to hospital. My mother was worried and said if she was in my place she would stop and just enjoy life. It was really bad for three months. I was exhausted and couldn\u2019t recover totally. But I am proud I played at my limit.\u201d</p> <p>Just over four months later, in Paris, she was tested mentally rather than just physically. A fourth successive defeat in a major final would have felt ruinous \u2013 especially as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/10/jelena-ostapenko-wins-french-open-simona-halep\" title=\"\">Halep had lost the French Open the previous year</a> when a set and 3-0 up in the final against Jelena Ostapenko. \u201cI have the courage to say I lost that final,\u201d she says. \u201cShe won it in the end because she was great and when you are young you just play. I lost it because I couldn\u2019t handle the emotions. For the next three months, I cannot use the word \u2018depressed\u2019 because it\u2019s too much, but I was sad for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/09/simona-halep-comes-of-age-french-open-first-grand-slam-title\" title=\"\">2018 French Open final</a>, Halep was a set and 2-0 down to an inspired Sloane Stephens. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect her to play so well on clay so I thought everything will be lost again,\u201d she says. \u201cI said I have to try something so I was more aggressive. I went to the net three times in one game, which I never do. I won the game and I had the confidence because I thought about the year before when I was leading and lost it. I really believed then.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90fa0ba7b6a8b64fb04fb73bf23b9ef0d52bf2e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90fa0ba7b6a8b64fb04fb73bf23b9ef0d52bf2e3/0_84_4357_2615/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simona Halep\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simona Halep receives medical attention during the final of the 2018 Australian Open.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Halep\u2019s face lights up as she remembers how 20 years of grinding work had finally given her the ultimate happiness she craved on court. \u201cEverything I had dreamed was real in that moment. All the people I love were there and when I lift the trophy, and the national song is played, it was the best moment I ever had. I was crying because it was huge. Maybe it will be my best moment as an athlete. But let\u2019s see. Maybe the future will give me even more.\u201d</p> <p>That future is made intriguing by Halep\u2019s decision not to replace Cahill immediately. In explaining how much he helped her overcome mentally, Halep suggests her personal challenge is shared by many Romanians. \u201cPeople here don\u2019t believe in themselves much. We are very talented but we don\u2019t have confidence. I was lucky. Darren is Australian and totally different. He pushed me to be positive. I changed a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Cahill took drastic action in March 2017 when, after she lost in Miami to Johanna Konta, he walked out because Halep was too negative. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d Halep says. \u201cDarren was really upset. He said that if I don\u2019t want to change it means I don\u2019t want to be the best. After a few days I started to work with a psychologist. This lady [Alexis Castorri] helped me understand myself and to work on my weaknesses. Darren was really proud and so we started to work together again because he really thought I want to be the best.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Can she succeed without a coach? \u201cNo, I need to find a coach. At this level it is impossible to go alone.\u201d Will she and Cahill be reunited? \u201cI don\u2019t know. I can say I hope so because he\u2019s a great person and that matters the most.\u201d</p> <p>Halep is as brave as she is honest and, in addressing all she gave up for tennis, she explains how she chose to undergo breast reduction surgery when she was 18. Did she feel scared? \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cMy family was scared. I was not scared because I knew I have to do it for tennis. My dream was just to be the best. So I was laughing when I went to the doctor. Afterwards, I was so much lighter and all my back problems were gone. So it was the best decision. I was dedicated 100% and did everything for tennis.\u201d</p> <p>Her rise is remarkable because, apart from her Romanian background giving her few advantages, Halep\u2019s character was perhaps not one of a typical sportsperson. \u201cSometimes I was crying that I don\u2019t want to go on the court because I was too shy,\u201d she says. \u201cI was very introverted. I am still an introvert.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ca0304548a750cd4909192ce9d4467f8b4d84d83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca0304548a750cd4909192ce9d4467f8b4d84d83/0_495_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simona Halep: \u2018Now I\u2019ve won a grand slam I can start to enjoy life more\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simona Halep: \u2018Now I\u2019ve won a grand slam I can start to enjoy life more.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matei Buta/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Halep smiles when I say she has been confident and revealing in this interview. \u201cI am open now. I improved a lot and I can be more natural.\u201d</p> <p>She has begun to support young Romanian players hoping to make it on the pro circuit. \u201cI received a lot from tennis so it\u2019s good to help others because it\u2019s very difficult. Many talented kids get lost because they don\u2019t have the money. Tennis is an expensive sport in Romania.\u201d</p> <p>Halep also supports a girls\u2019 ice hockey team. \u201cI am paying for everything they need \u2013 equipment, coaches, some tournaments outside of Romania. They started to beat the boys so it\u2019s good. Sometimes I go see them for the energy and to get motivated.\u201d</p> <p>She is also motivated by her own \u201cnew goals. A new way. Of course I\u2019m not like some players who won 10 or even 20 grand slams. But coming from Constanta [her home city], from nowhere, and becoming the best, is pretty huge for a Romanian, and for me as a person.</p> <p>\u201cNow I would love to be better in Fed Cup, to dream of the title, and the Olympics in 2020. I also want to win a grand slam again, to finish No 1 again. But I won\u2019t put pressure on myself. I will have few more years of tennis and then I want to improve in other ways. In 10 years I would love to have three kids, a beautiful family and be out of tennis \u2013 knowing I gave it everything.\u201d</p>",

I wouldn\u2019t have been this relaxed if I hadn\u2019t won the French Open. A big weight is off my shoulders.\u201d The 27-year-old has avoided opening up before because, apart from her shy and private nature, she was consumed by a fixation that was finally quenched in Paris last summer when winning her first grand slam. Halep can now offer insight into her life in Bucharest. We meet at 9am and she chats cheerfully while we are driven to an indoor court on the outskirts of the city. I watch her practise for the Australian Open, which begins next week in the contrasting furnace of Melbourne, where Halep suffered so much last year. On the way to lunch, with Halep drained after playing hard for two hours, she finds pleasure in the simple fact she spent her first Christmas at home in 10 years. \u201cI dedicated myself 100%, so many years,\u201d Halep says. \u201cNow I\u2019ve won a grand slam and I start to enjoy life more. I like to go out, make friendships. I\u2019m more open. Before I won the French I was very focused.\u201d Halep now appears the opposite of a one-dimensional obsessive. Instead, as she reflects on the dedication needed to reach her goals, she talks expansively about physical trauma, psychological barriers, the role of her former coach Darren Cahill and the sweetness of victory. Cahill will spend most of this year with his family in Australia and so Halep is currently without a coach. This unusual situation adds to the fascination as to whether, while returning from a back injury and exhaustion after her momentous 2018, she can become an even better player. \u201cI have the experience and that\u2019s why I decided to be alone for four months without a coach. I want to feel relaxed. I had a lot of pressure [last] year, from Romania, from the people around me, because everyone was talking about the grand slam title. It\u2019s just a sport but for me it was everything. That\u2019s why I suffered a little.\u201d Halep\u2019s psychological resolve has been tested but at last year\u2019s Australian Open she was subjected to a physical battering that meant she was taken to hospital after her draining three-set defeat in the final against Caroline Wozniacki. The entire tournament had been an ordeal. \u201cI have never played such a tough tournament and I hope I will not have to again,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a disaster. My mum was scared and she said I must never do that again because it was too much. It was a warning.\u201d She had twisted her ankle badly in the first round but struggled on to win that match and the next one before facing Lauren Davis. They played for three hours 45 minutes in searing heat, costing Davis some of her toenails, before Halep won 15-13 in the final set. \u201cThat was amazing,\u201d Halep says. \u201cShe played so well and had three match points. But I think I had more desire to win. That match meant a lot because mentally I was strong. I could stay so many hours on court.\u201d Halep survived another epic in the semi-finals, saving two match points and beating Angelique Kerber 9-7 in the third set, where \u201cit felt like every point was 20 rallies because she\u2019s a very big fighter. I was proud of that tournament. I was not even upset after I lost to Caroline in the final. I gave everything. But there was no more energy at the end. \u201cAfter the final, we finished with the press around 10pm and they took me to doping control. At 2am I left because I couldn\u2019t [produce a urine sample] as I was dehydrated. They took my blood. At the hotel I started shaking and they got me to hospital. My mother was worried and said if she was in my place she would stop and just enjoy life. It was really bad for three months. I was exhausted and couldn\u2019t recover totally. But I am proud I played at my limit.\u201d Just over four months later, in Paris, she was tested mentally rather than just physically. A fourth successive defeat in a major final would have felt ruinous \u2013 especially as Halep had lost the French Open the previous year when a set and 3-0 up in the final against Jelena Ostapenko. \u201cI have the courage to say I lost that final,\u201d she says. \u201cShe won it in the end because she was great and when you are young you just play. I lost it because I couldn\u2019t handle the emotions. For the next three months, I cannot use the word \u2018depressed\u2019 because it\u2019s too much, but I was sad for a long time.\u201d In the 2018 French Open final, Halep was a set and 2-0 down to an inspired Sloane Stephens. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect her to play so well on clay so I thought everything will be lost again,\u201d she says. \u201cI said I have to try something so I was more aggressive. I went to the net three times in one game, which I never do. I won the game and I had the confidence because I thought about the year before when I was leading and lost it. I really believed then.\u201d Halep\u2019s face lights up as she remembers how 20 years of grinding work had finally given her the ultimate happiness she craved on court. \u201cEverything I had dreamed was real in that moment. All the people I love were there and when I lift the trophy, and the national song is played, it was the best moment I ever had. I was crying because it was huge. Maybe it will be my best moment as an athlete. But let\u2019s see. Maybe the future will give me even more.\u201d That future is made intriguing by Halep\u2019s decision not to replace Cahill immediately. In explaining how much he helped her overcome mentally, Halep suggests her personal challenge is shared by many Romanians. \u201cPeople here don\u2019t believe in themselves much. We are very talented but we don\u2019t have confidence. I was lucky. Darren is Australian and totally different. He pushed me to be positive. I changed a lot.\u201d Cahill took drastic action in March 2017 when, after she lost in Miami to Johanna Konta, he walked out because Halep was too negative. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d Halep says. \u201cDarren was really upset. He said that if I don\u2019t want to change it means I don\u2019t want to be the best. After a few days I started to work with a psychologist. This lady [Alexis Castorri] helped me understand myself and to work on my weaknesses. Darren was really proud and so we started to work together again because he really thought I want to be the best.\u201d Can she succeed without a coach? \u201cNo, I need to find a coach. At this level it is impossible to go alone.\u201d Will she and Cahill be reunited? \u201cI don\u2019t know. I can say I hope so because he\u2019s a great person and that matters the most.\u201d Halep is as brave as she is honest and, in addressing all she gave up for tennis, she explains how she chose to undergo breast reduction surgery when she was 18. Did she feel scared? \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cMy family was scared. I was not scared because I knew I have to do it for tennis. My dream was just to be the best. So I was laughing when I went to the doctor. Afterwards, I was so much lighter and all my back problems were gone. So it was the best decision. I was dedicated 100% and did everything for tennis.\u201d Her rise is remarkable because, apart from her Romanian background giving her few advantages, Halep\u2019s character was perhaps not one of a typical sportsperson. \u201cSometimes I was crying that I don\u2019t want to go on the court because I was too shy,\u201d she says. \u201cI was very introverted. I am still an introvert.\u201d Halep smiles when I say she has been confident and revealing in this interview. \u201cI am open now. I improved a lot and I can be more natural.\u201d She has begun to support young Romanian players hoping to make it on the pro circuit. \u201cI received a lot from tennis so it\u2019s good to help others because it\u2019s very difficult. Many talented kids get lost because they don\u2019t have the money. Tennis is an expensive sport in Romania.\u201d Halep also supports a girls\u2019 ice hockey team. \u201cI am paying for everything they need \u2013 equipment, coaches, some tournaments outside of Romania. They started to beat the boys so it\u2019s good. Sometimes I go see them for the energy and to get motivated.\u201d She is also motivated by her own \u201cnew goals. A new way. Of course I\u2019m not like some players who won 10 or even 20 grand slams. But coming from Constanta [her home city], from nowhere, and becoming the best, is pretty huge for a Romanian, and for me as a person. \u201cNow I would love to be better in Fed Cup, to dream of the title, and the Olympics in 2020. I also want to win a grand slam again, to finish No 1 again. But I won\u2019t put pressure on myself. I will have few more years of tennis and then I want to improve in other ways. In 10 years I would love to have three kids, a beautiful family and be out of tennis \u2013 knowing I gave it everything.\u201d",

Results had improved under Solari, overtaking Julen Lopetegui in terms of points gained, but while they won, they didn\u2019t win many over. On one level, at least, that\u2019s not surprising. He arrived 10 weeks into the season, a temporary coach formally made permanent a fortnight later yet never really backed as a fixture, always likely to be the weakest link. While it is forgotten amid their European success, he also inherited a team that finished third last season, <em>17</em> points behind Barcelona. There was a reason Zinedine Zidane left. Lots of them, in fact. And Cristiano Ronaldo departed soon after. Lopetegui lasted 138 days.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Feeling the finger of blame pointing his way after Villarreal, Solari pointed out that he\u2019d taken over the team in ninth, and led them to fourth, recovering slowly. But deeply underwhelming victories, 1-0 against Rayo, 1-0 at Huesca, 2-0 over Valencia, 4-2 at Celta, and 2-0 against Valladolid, were not exactly conclusive evidence of a significant improvement. They\u2019d been taken apart by Eibar, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/24/real-madrid-sink-to-embarrassing-3-0-defeat-to-eibar-in-la-liga\">defeated 3-0</a>. And they came back and drew 2-2 at Villarreal. Now they\u2019d been defeated by Real Sociedad, the same day he was told a draw was not acceptable. Not here. And not at Villarreal. The week that should have been about Sevilla and Atl\u00e9tico, became about Madrid, and for all the wrong reasons. Again.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/07/andres-iniesta-under-fire-after-posing-with-people-in-blackface\">Andr\u00e9s Iniesta under fire after posing with people in blackface</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Take a look at that list again, then at the table: that\u2019s eight games against the teams in 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 17th, 19th and 20th. Europe wasn\u2019t their elixir either, not yet. CSKA Moscow came and beat them 3-0. Madrid are not even fourth any more. After a weekend in which only two of the top seven won \u2013 Barcelona at Getafe and Alav\u00e9s against Valencia \u2013 and in which Sevilla and Atl\u00e9tico played out the kind of draw that <em>is</em> acceptable, a match Diego Simeone described as \u201cexciting, hard and lovely\u201d, Madrid are now fifth. And while Solari took over seven points off the top, the gap is now 10. Ten from Barcelona, five from Atl\u00e9tico, three from Sevilla and one from Alav\u00e9s. They\u2019re closer to Valladolid than they are to the top.</p> \n<p>Leo Messi and Luis Su\u00e1rez scored in a tough 2-1 victory over Getafe, the kind the Uruguayan said \u201cgives you half a league\u201d, and in which they were fortunate that Getafe\u2019s opening \u201cgoal\u201d was ruled out. They\u2019ve now scored more between them than Madrid, who haven\u2019t reached this stage of the season with so few goals for a quarter of a century. While Ronaldo had only scored two league goals by Christmas last season, it\u2019s natural to see a huge gap where he once stood. They have 26 goals so far; in his nine seasons there, the average at this stage was almost 50. On Saturday, with Bale, Mariano and Asensio injured, there was little on the bench and there are gaps in the stands, too: the Bernab\u00e9u is big, true, but it\u2019s yet to fill. And if there\u2019s been bad luck and injuries, it\u2019s hard to recall a really good performance this season, Roma apart. Madrid were fantastic that night, but it was fleeting.</p> \n<p>So, while the penalty naturally dominated the debate, it didn\u2019t hide Madrid\u2019s problems, not least because they\u2019re not new. \u201cAdrift\u201d, \u201cdepressed\u201d, \u201crock bottom\u201d, ran some of the headlines. \u201cMadrid stand there exposed, in a tanga,\u201d wrote El Pa\u00eds, \u201creality is the scourge of hope.\u201d Ramos insisted: \u201cMy legs hurt from running so much,\u201d but Madrid are not right. Only Vinicius offered hope and in the second half it was startling how easily Real Sociedad, led by Mikel Merino, walked through them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29b48c2e0e170655734c8585d25ada476c59c458\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29b48c2e0e170655734c8585d25ada476c59c458/0_0_3543_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Santiago Solari\u2019s side are now 10 points adrift of Barcelona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Santiago Solari\u2019s side are now 10 points adrift of Barcelona.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ruben Albarran/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAlmost every game, the other team scores and we don\u2019t score many,\u201d Luka Modric said. \u201cThat\u2019s our problem, but not our only one. It\u2019s repeated almost every game. We have to sit down, get together and talk, to ask what is happening to us, why things like this happen. We can\u2019t always blame the manager. We lack goals. We lacked unity on the pitch. We have to improve and I include myself \u2013 I\u2019m here to accept responsibility. We were 0-1 down in three minutes and we can\u2019t always do this. We can\u2019t have a cock-up every game.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 Jes\u00fas Navas is 33, it says here. But that can\u2019t be right, can it? \u201cHe\u2019s like a kid who\u2019s just starting out, a breath of fresh air,\u201d Sevilla coach Pablo Mach\u00edn said. \u201cExceptional,\u201d Simeone called him. So exceptional that Atl\u00e9tico changed formations \u2013 twice, in fact \u2013 to try to stop him as first and second met at the S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n. Navas tore into Atl\u00e9tico, like a \u201cwhirlwind\u201d, Diario de Sevilla said. \u201cThey literally couldn\u2019t get him down off his bike,\u201d the paper added. Navas was unstoppable in a first half in which Sevilla dominated and should have been more than 1-0 up when Antoine Griezmann curled in a wonderful free-kick. Simeone sent Koke over to help Sa\u00fal and Atl\u00e9tico got control in the second half \u2013 although Navas still managed to leave both of them trailing with a nutmeg and yet another burst of acceleration \u2013 and it finished 1-1, with both goalkeepers impressing hugely. \u201cThey\u2019re extraordinarily good,\u201d Simeone said. And he wasn\u2019t wrong, an ovation ringing round at the end.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b33dd855c1c042c7083156bb586cec7c3c87d25\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b33dd855c1c042c7083156bb586cec7c3c87d25/0_0_2276_1517/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sevilla\u2019s Joris Gnagnon jumps over Sa\u00fal and Rodri.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sevilla\u2019s Joris Gnagnon jumps over Sa\u00fal and Rodri.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cristina Quicler/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cDanger here,\u201d one Alav\u00e9s player said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be dancing!\u201d another added. It was 90 minutes before kick-off and the pitch at Mendizorroza was half frozen. Marcelino, the Valencia manager complained, but Alav\u00e9s got on with it and so did Mendizorroza, rocking as ever. One down thanks to a lovely Dani Parejo free-kick which shouldn\u2019t have been, they came back to win 2-1. And they did it with a sense of security that was striking too. This is the best first half to a season in their entire first division history \u2013 and with a game to spare. They haven\u2019t been beaten at home for a year. It\u2019s no fluke.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Huesca won at home for the first time ever in <em>primera \u2013 </em>and against Betis too. It was about time, in truth: they have been much better than their position suggests.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Messi: fox in the box. Luis Su\u00e1rez: volley maestro. Barcelona: refusing to say it\u2019s over, but that\u2019s a big step taken.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\"

      "bodyText": "Santi Solari was right, but he got it so very wrong. First they attacked him for what he said, then they attacked him for what he did. Others, meanwhile, just gave up and walked away, leaving him standing where Real Madrid managers so often stand: alone. On Saturday, two days after his team had been held 2-2 at Villarreal on their return from the winter break and winning the Club World Cup, the hounds released, Solari insisted that draws shouldn\u2019t be \u201cunderestimated\u201d; as if to prove the point, a prisoner of his words, the next day they were beaten 2-0 by Real Sociedad at the Bernab\u00e9u, the league seeming to slip out of sight again on the first weekend of 2019 \u2013 20 games ahead of time. The league and some of the fans too: there weren\u2019t that many of them anyway \u2013 at 53,412, this was Madrid\u2019s second worst attendance in a season in which they\u2019re already averaging 6,000 fewer than last year \u2013 and when Rub\u00e9n Pardo headed in a second for Real Sociedad, finally making the game safe, lots of those who were there headed for the exit. Some whistled, some waved hankies, a few even demanded resignations, but most departed in silence, resigned to it all, symbolic somehow. Others might, but they weren\u2019t about to accept this. Solari\u2019s remark was not entirely irrational, and he followed it up on Sunday by insisting the only people who underestimate opponents are \u201cthose who have never played the game\u201d, but it was the kind of thing you don\u2019t say and soon everyone was wading in. Marca had responded to the manager\u2019s words by splashing a reminder across its front page: \u201cSolari, you coach Real Madrid!\u201d The problem is he coaches this Madrid in this league, where only Barcelona have won more than half their games; a Madrid who demonstrated a draw shouldn\u2019t be underestimated by going one worse, leaving Marca to follow up with a headline that runs: \u201cThe Bernab\u00e9u empties for a reason.\u201d And while there is more to it, part of the reason is simple: Real Madrid are not very good. Real Sociedad arrived at the Bernab\u00e9u, where they hadn\u2019t won for 15 years, in 15th place, three points off the relegation zone, and they had just sacked their manager. Yet within three minutes, they were a goal up. It began badly and finished worse. The fastest ever penalty given against Madrid at home was put away by Willian Jos\u00e9. In a game that became wild and wide open, that could have finished 4-4 or just about any scoreline in between, Madrid had two penalty shouts of their own \u2013 the first for Sergio Ramos, the second for Vinicius at 0-1. The Brazilian was brought down by Gero Rulli, although la Real\u2019s goalkeeper did seem to get a slight touch on the ball and the referee, Jos\u00e9 Luis Munuera Montero waved play on. That wasn\u2019t so strange; what was strange was that VAR didn\u2019t intervene. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s for,\u201d said Emilio Butragueno, who usually doesn\u2019t say anything. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t get used when it\u2019s so evident, it loses all meaning,\u201d Solari said. \u201cA scandal,\u201d Ramos called it. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not pre-meditated, but it does make you think,\u201d he added. There are other, more important things to think about, though. Results had improved under Solari, overtaking Julen Lopetegui in terms of points gained, but while they won, they didn\u2019t win many over. On one level, at least, that\u2019s not surprising. He arrived 10 weeks into the season, a temporary coach formally made permanent a fortnight later yet never really backed as a fixture, always likely to be the weakest link. While it is forgotten amid their European success, he also inherited a team that finished third last season, 17 points behind Barcelona. There was a reason Zinedine Zidane left. Lots of them, in fact. And Cristiano Ronaldo departed soon after. Lopetegui lasted 138 days. Feeling the finger of blame pointing his way after Villarreal, Solari pointed out that he\u2019d taken over the team in ninth, and led them to fourth, recovering slowly. But deeply underwhelming victories, 1-0 against Rayo, 1-0 at Huesca, 2-0 over Valencia, 4-2 at Celta, and 2-0 against Valladolid, were not exactly conclusive evidence of a significant improvement. They\u2019d been taken apart by Eibar, defeated 3-0. And they came back and drew 2-2 at Villarreal. Now they\u2019d been defeated by Real Sociedad, the same day he was told a draw was not acceptable. Not here. And not at Villarreal. The week that should have been about Sevilla and Atl\u00e9tico, became about Madrid, and for all the wrong reasons. Again. Take a look at that list again, then at the table: that\u2019s eight games against the teams in 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 17th, 19th and 20th. Europe wasn\u2019t their elixir either, not yet. CSKA Moscow came and beat them 3-0. Madrid are not even fourth any more. After a weekend in which only two of the top seven won \u2013 Barcelona at Getafe and Alav\u00e9s against Valencia \u2013 and in which Sevilla and Atl\u00e9tico played out the kind of draw that is acceptable, a match Diego Simeone described as \u201cexciting, hard and lovely\u201d, Madrid are now fifth. And while Solari took over seven points off the top, the gap is now 10. Ten from Barcelona, five from Atl\u00e9tico, three from Sevilla and one from Alav\u00e9s. They\u2019re closer to Valladolid than they are to the top. Leo Messi and Luis Su\u00e1rez scored in a tough 2-1 victory over Getafe, the kind the Uruguayan said \u201cgives you half a league\u201d, and in which they were fortunate that Getafe\u2019s opening \u201cgoal\u201d was ruled out. They\u2019ve now scored more between them than Madrid, who haven\u2019t reached this stage of the season with so few goals for a quarter of a century. While Ronaldo had only scored two league goals by Christmas last season, it\u2019s natural to see a huge gap where he once stood. They have 26 goals so far; in his nine seasons there, the average at this stage was almost 50. On Saturday, with Bale, Mariano and Asensio injured, there was little on the bench and there are gaps in the stands, too: the Bernab\u00e9u is big, true, but it\u2019s yet to fill. And if there\u2019s been bad luck and injuries, it\u2019s hard to recall a really good performance this season, Roma apart. Madrid were fantastic that night, but it was fleeting. So, while the penalty naturally dominated the debate, it didn\u2019t hide Madrid\u2019s problems, not least because they\u2019re not new. \u201cAdrift\u201d, \u201cdepressed\u201d, \u201crock bottom\u201d, ran some of the headlines. \u201cMadrid stand there exposed, in a tanga,\u201d wrote El Pa\u00eds, \u201creality is the scourge of hope.\u201d Ramos insisted: \u201cMy legs hurt from running so much,\u201d but Madrid are not right. Only Vinicius offered hope and in the second half it was startling how easily Real Sociedad, led by Mikel Merino, walked through them. \u201cAlmost every game, the other team scores and we don\u2019t score many,\u201d Luka Modric said. \u201cThat\u2019s our problem, but not our only one. It\u2019s repeated almost every game. We have to sit down, get together and talk, to ask what is happening to us, why things like this happen. We can\u2019t always blame the manager. We lack goals. We lacked unity on the pitch. We have to improve and I include myself \u2013 I\u2019m here to accept responsibility. We were 0-1 down in three minutes and we can\u2019t always do this. We can\u2019t have a cock-up every game.\u201d Talking points \u2022 Jes\u00fas Navas is 33, it says here. But that can\u2019t be right, can it? \u201cHe\u2019s like a kid who\u2019s just starting out, a breath of fresh air,\u201d Sevilla coach Pablo Mach\u00edn said. \u201cExceptional,\u201d Simeone called him. So exceptional that Atl\u00e9tico changed formations \u2013 twice, in fact \u2013 to try to stop him as first and second met at the S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n. Navas tore into Atl\u00e9tico, like a \u201cwhirlwind\u201d, Diario de Sevilla said. \u201cThey literally couldn\u2019t get him down off his bike,\u201d the paper added. Navas was unstoppable in a first half in which Sevilla dominated and should have been more than 1-0 up when Antoine Griezmann curled in a wonderful free-kick. Simeone sent Koke over to help Sa\u00fal and Atl\u00e9tico got control in the second half \u2013 although Navas still managed to leave both of them trailing with a nutmeg and yet another burst of acceleration \u2013 and it finished 1-1, with both goalkeepers impressing hugely. \u201cThey\u2019re extraordinarily good,\u201d Simeone said. And he wasn\u2019t wrong, an ovation ringing round at the end. \u2022 \u201cDanger here,\u201d one Alav\u00e9s player said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be dancing!\u201d another added. It was 90 minutes before kick-off and the pitch at Mendizorroza was half frozen. Marcelino, the Valencia manager complained, but Alav\u00e9s got on with it and so did Mendizorroza, rocking as ever. One down thanks to a lovely Dani Parejo free-kick which shouldn\u2019t have been, they came back to win 2-1. And they did it with a sense of security that was striking too. This is the best first half to a season in their entire first division history \u2013 and with a game to spare. They haven\u2019t been beaten at home for a year. It\u2019s no fluke. \u2022 Huesca won at home for the first time ever in primera \u2013 and against Betis too. It was about time, in truth: they have been much better than their position suggests. \u2022 Messi: fox in the box. Luis Su\u00e1rez: volley maestro. Barcelona: refusing to say it\u2019s over, but that\u2019s a big step taken.",

      "body": "<p>In 1982, when she was 60 years old, Sara Berman left her husband of 38 years and her home in Tel Aviv, taking one suitcase with her. It contained a potato grater, an old travel clock, a silver funnel, a cookie press for making sesame cookies, and clothing. Berman moved to a small studio apartment in Manhattan\u2019s West Village. Her two daughters lived in Manhattan and so did her grandson.</p> <p>One day, she decided to wear only white. She arranged her ironed, starched, folded white garments in totemic piles on white shelves in her white wardrobe, along with the three watches she liked to wear all at once, and one or two other objects.</p> <p>Hers was an \u201cedited\u201d life, says Berman\u2019s daughter, <a href=\"https://www.mairakalman.com/\" title=\"\">Maira Kalman</a>, and a quest \u201cfor beauty and clarity\u201d. After Berman died, in 2004, Maira, an author and illustrator, and her sister were sorting out her mother\u2019s effects. \u201cIt was when we were looking at this beautiful landscape of a closet and a life that the idea for an exhibition came,\u201d recalls Maira. \u201c\u2018We should save it,\u2019 I said to my sister. \u2018One day it will be an exhibit.\u2019 I just knew it had to be part of our culture.\u201d</p> <p>Berman\u2019s grandson, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alextkalman?lang=en\" title=\"\">Alex Kalman</a>, a writer, designer and curator, agreed. But it wasn\u2019t until 2014 that he acquired his first gallery space: a 4ft x 5ft disused freight elevator shaft in a Tribeca alleyway. He called it Mmuseumm. <em>Sara Berman\u2019s Closet</em> was Mmuseumm\u2019s second exhibit. Then, in 2017, the exhibit transferred to the American Wing of the <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/\" title=\"\">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>. It was quite a step up for its unknown owner and her humble collection of shirts, underwear and brogues.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rather than an endless accumulation of matter, what Berman had was intentionally acquired and placed there</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Visitors to the Met were captivated, says Alex. \u201cWe overheard visitors of all nationalities saying: \u2018Who is this Sara Berman?\u2019 They expected her to be someone of great historical importance.\u201d Exhibiting the closet was, he says, \u201ca way of expanding the narrative of whose stories are being told, and how and why\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEverything is usually based on wealth at the Met,\u201d adds Alex\u2019s mother. \u201cBut we were taking something that was from the vernacular, that was intimate and from the everyday. It spoke to people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe became an unexpected hero,\u201d says Alex.</p> <p>The closet certainly has a devotional intensity \u2013 and provokes outsider anxiety, even envy in those whose failure to impose order over the chaos of their material lives is writ large in their floor-drobes and paper mountains. But Berman was no ascetic, says Maira, and was \u201cvery funny\u201d. The closet, like her lifestyle, was merely a kind of \u201coffering\u201d by a woman who \u201chad found what was important\u201d and measured her new stab at life in cherished routines: eating pizza with her grandson every Wednesday in the <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/\" title=\"\">Museum of Modern Art</a>\u2019s cafeteria, watching <em><a href=\"https://www.jeopardy.com/\" title=\"\">Jeopardy!</a></em> every night on TV, writing a weekly letter to her sister back in Tel Aviv.</p> <p>The public response to the exhibition inspired Maira and Alex to create the hybrid memoir, <em><a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/sara-berman-closet\" title=\"\">Sara Berman\u2019s Closet</a></em>. \u201cThis is a book about Sara,\u201d we learn from handwritten text on a cover that features a portrait of Berman, painted by Maira. Her striking white suit and overcoat are offset against a fuchsia sidewalk and matching tree behind her. \u201cAnd her journey to America. and eating Lemon ices. and the meaning of Time.\u201d The imperfect punctuation and capitalisation are in keeping with Alex\u2019s lyrical prose and Maira\u2019s naive paintings. Along with family photographs and documents, they chronicle Berman\u2019s early life in Belarus, her years in Israel and new beginnings in America.</p> <p>Berman\u2019s existence \u201cwas about intentionality,\u201d says Alex. \u201cRather than an endless accumulation of matter, what she had was intentionally acquired and placed there.\u201d Her actions were equally mindful. The text opposite an illustration of a lemon and a letter states: \u201cEvery action was done with care. Every day was filled with precise and Brilliant Actions.\u201d</p> <p>There is a feeling of energy and wit in the memoir; a sense of a life in motion held steady by order, routine and stillness. Berman was playful and had a keen sense of the absurd that ran counter to what was, hints her daughter, a difficult marriage. Her pared-down existence \u201cwas borne of necessity and sorrow,\u201d says Maira. \u201cShe left my father. They had a reasonably well-to-do life with lots of possessions. She left that life. She got a studio apartment with not much room. You can\u2019t accumulate too much.</p> <p>\u201cBut starting fresh, what do you need? A bed, a table you write letters on to your sister and iron on \u2013 a fantastic limitation. It was the greatest freedom she had ever encountered in her own life,\u201d she says, calling to mind Virginia Woolf\u2019s exaltation of private space in <em>A Room of One\u2019s Own</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93e405a567f6e3f8f44a072657ee3ff3113177c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93e405a567f6e3f8f44a072657ee3ff3113177c4/169_148_10797_7290/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maira Kalman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018She became an unexpected hero\u2019: a young Sara Berman</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Berman loved ironing, and so does her daughter, who finds meaning in an act that symbolises the paramaters of her mother\u2019s known world when she was growing up in Belarus. \u201cShe came from a small village. Women never walked outside the house. For them, the expression of work was to take care of the home and family with utmost devotion.\u201d</p> <p>The elevation of the domestic to art recalls Tracey Emin\u2019s 1998 Turner Prize-winning artwork, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/27/tracey-emin-my-bed-violent-mess-sex-death\" title=\"\">My Bed</a></em>. If that was an unsettling expression of chaos, Berman\u2019s closet is a paean to the soothing power of order and also, says Maira, to \u201cwhat it reveals about us as humans: that we need to persevere in this thing called life and to find a way to do so with meaning.\u201d</p> <p>Her curated life and uniform of white were \u201cnot for show\u201d, says Maira. \u201cShe was beautifully dressed all her life. But she was not vain. It was all done with a great sense of humour and certainly not in a self-conscious manner. It came from a sense of pleasure and wellbeing.\u201d</p> <p>The potato grater, like its owner, travels through space and time. \u201cThe most quotidian things in the world can have the most meaning,\u201d says Maira. \u201cWhat we are saying is, the most humble, the most simple, the smallest moments in life are really the sweetest and can live on through decades and through centuries. We never want to forget that. We like to think of Sara making her potato pancakes with the grater, and to think of her as a source of wisdom.\u201d</p> <p>Remembering is, of course, a way of conquering time. It is fitting, then, that next year <em>Sara Berman\u2019s Closet</em> will mark the Fourth of July celebrations. It will be exhibited beside the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia \u2013 \u201ca monument to freedom and independence.\u201d Alex says. \u201cIt raises the question of what is monument-worthy. <em>Sara Berman\u2019s Closet</em> is a monument to a life lived with great humility and tenderness.\u201d And an awful lot of starch.</p> <p><em>Sara Berman\u2019s Closet by Maira and Alex Kalman is published by HarperDesign at \u00a320</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "In 1982, when she was 60 years old, Sara Berman left her husband of 38 years and her home in Tel Aviv, taking one suitcase with her. It contained a potato grater, an old travel clock, a silver funnel, a cookie press for making sesame cookies, and clothing. Berman moved to a small studio apartment in Manhattan\u2019s West Village. Her two daughters lived in Manhattan and so did her grandson. One day, she decided to wear only white. She arranged her ironed, starched, folded white garments in totemic piles on white shelves in her white wardrobe, along with the three watches she liked to wear all at once, and one or two other objects. Hers was an \u201cedited\u201d life, says Berman\u2019s daughter, Maira Kalman, and a quest \u201cfor beauty and clarity\u201d. After Berman died, in 2004, Maira, an author and illustrator, and her sister were sorting out her mother\u2019s effects. \u201cIt was when we were looking at this beautiful landscape of a closet and a life that the idea for an exhibition came,\u201d recalls Maira. \u201c\u2018We should save it,\u2019 I said to my sister. \u2018One day it will be an exhibit.\u2019 I just knew it had to be part of our culture.\u201d Berman\u2019s grandson, Alex Kalman, a writer, designer and curator, agreed. But it wasn\u2019t until 2014 that he acquired his first gallery space: a 4ft x 5ft disused freight elevator shaft in a Tribeca alleyway. He called it Mmuseumm. Sara Berman\u2019s Closet was Mmuseumm\u2019s second exhibit. Then, in 2017, the exhibit transferred to the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was quite a step up for its unknown owner and her humble collection of shirts, underwear and brogues. Visitors to the Met were captivated, says Alex. \u201cWe overheard visitors of all nationalities saying: \u2018Who is this Sara Berman?\u2019 They expected her to be someone of great historical importance.\u201d Exhibiting the closet was, he says, \u201ca way of expanding the narrative of whose stories are being told, and how and why\u201d. \u201cEverything is usually based on wealth at the Met,\u201d adds Alex\u2019s mother. \u201cBut we were taking something that was from the vernacular, that was intimate and from the everyday. It spoke to people.\u201d \u201cShe became an unexpected hero,\u201d says Alex. The closet certainly has a devotional intensity \u2013 and provokes outsider anxiety, even envy in those whose failure to impose order over the chaos of their material lives is writ large in their floor-drobes and paper mountains. But Berman was no ascetic, says Maira, and was \u201cvery funny\u201d. The closet, like her lifestyle, was merely a kind of \u201coffering\u201d by a woman who \u201chad found what was important\u201d and measured her new stab at life in cherished routines: eating pizza with her grandson every Wednesday in the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s cafeteria, watching Jeopardy! every night on TV, writing a weekly letter to her sister back in Tel Aviv. The public response to the exhibition inspired Maira and Alex to create the hybrid memoir, Sara Berman\u2019s Closet. \u201cThis is a book about Sara,\u201d we learn from handwritten text on a cover that features a portrait of Berman, painted by Maira. Her striking white suit and overcoat are offset against a fuchsia sidewalk and matching tree behind her. \u201cAnd her journey to America. and eating Lemon ices. and the meaning of Time.\u201d The imperfect punctuation and capitalisation are in keeping with Alex\u2019s lyrical prose and Maira\u2019s naive paintings. Along with family photographs and documents, they chronicle Berman\u2019s early life in Belarus, her years in Israel and new beginnings in America. Berman\u2019s existence \u201cwas about intentionality,\u201d says Alex. \u201cRather than an endless accumulation of matter, what she had was intentionally acquired and placed there.\u201d Her actions were equally mindful. The text opposite an illustration of a lemon and a letter states: \u201cEvery action was done with care. Every day was filled with precise and Brilliant Actions.\u201d There is a feeling of energy and wit in the memoir; a sense of a life in motion held steady by order, routine and stillness. Berman was playful and had a keen sense of the absurd that ran counter to what was, hints her daughter, a difficult marriage. Her pared-down existence \u201cwas borne of necessity and sorrow,\u201d says Maira. \u201cShe left my father. They had a reasonably well-to-do life with lots of possessions. She left that life. She got a studio apartment with not much room. You can\u2019t accumulate too much. \u201cBut starting fresh, what do you need? A bed, a table you write letters on to your sister and iron on \u2013 a fantastic limitation. It was the greatest freedom she had ever encountered in her own life,\u201d she says, calling to mind Virginia Woolf\u2019s exaltation of private space in A Room of One\u2019s Own. Berman loved ironing, and so does her daughter, who finds meaning in an act that symbolises the paramaters of her mother\u2019s known world when she was growing up in Belarus. \u201cShe came from a small village. Women never walked outside the house. For them, the expression of work was to take care of the home and family with utmost devotion.\u201d The elevation of the domestic to art recalls Tracey Emin\u2019s 1998 Turner Prize-winning artwork, My Bed. If that was an unsettling expression of chaos, Berman\u2019s closet is a paean to the soothing power of order and also, says Maira, to \u201cwhat it reveals about us as humans: that we need to persevere in this thing called life and to find a way to do so with meaning.\u201d Her curated life and uniform of white were \u201cnot for show\u201d, says Maira. \u201cShe was beautifully dressed all her life. But she was not vain. It was all done with a great sense of humour and certainly not in a self-conscious manner. It came from a sense of pleasure and wellbeing.\u201d The potato grater, like its owner, travels through space and time. \u201cThe most quotidian things in the world can have the most meaning,\u201d says Maira. \u201cWhat we are saying is, the most humble, the most simple, the smallest moments in life are really the sweetest and can live on through decades and through centuries. We never want to forget that. We like to think of Sara making her potato pancakes with the grater, and to think of her as a source of wisdom.\u201d Remembering is, of course, a way of conquering time. It is fitting, then, that next year Sara Berman\u2019s Closet will mark the Fourth of July celebrations. It will be exhibited beside the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia \u2013 \u201ca monument to freedom and independence.\u201d Alex says. \u201cIt raises the question of what is monument-worthy. Sara Berman\u2019s Closet is a monument to a life lived with great humility and tenderness.\u201d And an awful lot of starch. Sara Berman\u2019s Closet by Maira and Alex Kalman is published by HarperDesign at \u00a320",

After reaching both hands across her chest while standing behind her, he picks up the microphone and says he is getting \u201ccarried away\u201d. When asked her age, the unnamed girl replies: \u201c17.\u201d Drake responds: \u201cI can\u2019t go to jail yet, man!\u201d He asks: \u201cWhy do you look like that? You thick [curvaceous]. Look at all this.\u201d He continues: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should feel guilty or not, but I had fun. I like the way your breasts feel against my chest.\u201d He then kisses her on the cheeks and forehead. Drake would have been age 23 at the time the video was made. The age of consent in Colorado is 17. He has not responded to the video on social media and his US publicist declined to comment to USA Today. The Guardian has contacted representatives for the rapper. It is the second time Drake has faced criticism in recent days. On 3 January, he appeared to tease a forthcoming collaboration with the R&amp;B singer Chris Brown. The pair feuded publicly in 2012 and 2015, but appeared to reconcile in 2018 when Drake invited Brown on stage in Los Angeles. Drake is nominated in seven categories at next month\u2019s Grammy awards, including album of the year for his 2018 release, Scorpion.",

Top story: Wall standoff continues as shutdown enters third week Donald Trump has said he is prepared to declare a national emergency over immigration in the \u201cnext few days\u201d to bypass Congress and build his coveted wall on the US border with Mexico. As the partial government shutdown enters its third week, triggered by the president\u2019s demands for $5.6bn to fund the wall, there has reportedly been little progress in negotiations between the White House and House Democrats, who have staunchly refused to pass a spending bill that includes wall funding.

The committee has interviewed dozens of witnesses for its own investigation, including Trump Jr, Stone, Jared Kushner and Michael Cohen. Cohen. Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer has already pleaded guilty to perjury for lying to Congress over attempts to reach a deal to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Adam Schiff.

Bolton says US troops to stay in Syria until Isis defeated Trump\u2019s shock announcement the US would pull its 2,000 remaining troops out of Syria led to the resignation of his defense secretary, James Mattis, last month. Now the US national security adviser, John Bolton, has rowed back on the withdrawal plan, insisting the US will only leave Syria once Isis has been conclusively defeated and America\u2019s Kurdish allies protected \u2013 conditions that could take years to achieve. Now or never? Trump claimed in December that Isis was beaten and US troops were \u201call coming back, and they\u2019re coming back now\u201d. On Sunday, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to be removing our troops. I never said we\u2019re doing it that quickly.\u201d Bohemian Rhapsody wins big at \u2018questionable\u2019 Golden Globes The Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody and the racially charged road trip comedy Green Book unexpectedly scooped the top film awards at the Golden Globes in LA on Sunday, winning drama and comedy respectively. The results \u2013 which some critics have called \u201cquestionable\u201d in the TV and film categories alike \u2013 have upended an awards season in which more critically adored films, such as A Star is Born, were expected to triumph.

Soldiers in Gabon attempted a coup to overthrow the west African nation\u2019s president, Ali Bongo, who is recovering from a stroke. Soldiers appeared on state television saying they had seized control of the government \u201cto restore democracy\u201d but have since been detained. A 20-year-old Houston man, Eric Black Jr, has been charged with the murder of Jazmine Barnes, the seven-year-old girl who was killed when a man fired into her family\u2019s car last weekend. The Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa has broken the record for the most retweeted message in Twitter history after offering \u201cone million yen ($9,200) in cash to 100 people\u201d who shared a tweet about his fashion retailer\u2019s recent sales figures. Listen to Today in Focus: the anti-vaccine movement The disgraced doctor Andrew Wakefield has returned to prominence, buoyed by vaccine scepticism among rightwing populists.

The rule is intended to combat the pay gap between men and women, since advocates say asking the question and basing a new hire\u2019s salary on what they made in the past can lead to a pattern of underpayment that follows women through their careers. A California law took effect banning pet stores from selling dogs, cats and rabbits obtained from private breeders. Only animals that come from shelters or non-profit rescue groups may be sold, a measure meant to combat so-called puppy mills where animals are bred in poor conditions. Also in California, pets will be treated more like members of the family in divorce cases, with judges allowed to decide custody based on what\u2019s best for the animal, instead of treating them like any other property. In New York state, public bathrooms for both men and women will be required to include diaper changing tables in new or renovated buildings. The measure addresses complaints that men\u2019s rooms often lacked a spot for dads to change their babies, with facilities provided only for women. A unanimous jury verdict will be required to convict someone of a serious felony committed from the beginning of 2019 onwards, in Louisiana. A Jim Crow-era law had said that for most crimes, the defendant was found guilty if 10 of 12 jurors voted for conviction. A Washington law took effect requiring health insurance companies that offer maternity coverage to also pay for abortions. Vermont is now taking applications for people who want to get paid up to $10,000 to move to the state. Governor Phil Scott signed the legislation last spring, seeking to bolster the state\u2019s small and ageing population. To qualify for the money, up to $5,000 a year for two years, applicants must be full-time employees of a company based outside Vermont who work remotely while living in the state. The money isn\u2019t a no-strings attached grant, but must pay for expenses such as relocation, computer equipment and broadband access.",

      "body": "<p>After church, Flint Laub, his two wives and their 10 children sat down at the kitchen table to eat pizza.</p> <p>The lunch was served in the big house, where Michelle Laub, 32, and her seven children live. Flint\u2019s second wife is Ruth Anne Laub, who is 25 and Michelle\u2019s half-sister. She recently gave birth to her third child. Ruth Anne Laub and her kids live in a second house a few steps away from the big one.</p> <p>The Laubs live in a polygamous community of perhaps 400 people in rural Missouri between the towns of Humansville and Stockton. The residents call it \u201cthe Ranch\u201d, though the agriculture is limited to a hay field and a few cows and chickens. People in the neighboring towns refer to the community as \u201cthe Compound\u201d, but you won\u2019t see any high walls or armed guards \u2014 just brown dirt roads winding through clusters of trees and homes.</p> <p>Inside the big house, the adults laughed about what outsiders think of them. Flint, 40, runs a roofing company. If someone asks him if he\u2019s a polygamist, he will say yes. Sometimes people will ask if the Compound is really prepped for warfare,<strong> </strong>assuming they are survivalists (they\u2019re not).<strong> </strong>Ruth Anne, who has worked as a first responder in Stockton, says one day someone asked her if she believed in air conditioning. Yes, she said. Her house is modern; constructed from concrete poured into plastic foam.</p> <p>\u201cIt probably bothers me that people think that\u2019s who we are,\u201d Ruth Anne said, \u201cbut it\u2019s funny, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I was raised outside the religion,\u201d Flint said, \u201cand heard about people with multiple wives, I would think that\u2019s pretty crazy, too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"120fe9861b323fb933b2add4d2c7d3be38437a18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/120fe9861b323fb933b2add4d2c7d3be38437a18/0_0_3000_2108/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In the polygamous community that residents call The Ranch, members gather for Sunday morning church service.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the polygamous community that residents call the Ranch, members gather for Sunday morning church service.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liv Paggiarino/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>In God\u2019s eyes</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI believe Missouri is the promised land,\u201d said Sean Anderson, a 51-year-old fundamentalist Mormon from Mexico who has also lived in Arizona and Utah. He recently moved to The Ranch with his wife and their six children.</p> <p>The residents are a hodgepodge of people whose<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/11/sister-wives-utah-polygamy-ban-tlc-show-religious-freedom\"> members in Utah</a> haven\u2019t always gotten along. But here, the polygamists worship not only with each other, but also with the Mormon church, also known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which officially<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/11/mormon-church-joseph-smith-founders-polygamy-uncomfortable-history\"> abandoned polygamy in 1890</a> and excommunicates members found practicing it.</p> <p>Despite their differences, the mainstream Latter-day Saints and people on The Ranch still share core beliefs, and the community<strong> </strong>still uses its texts. This week, Seth Laub, an elder in the congregation, gave a lesson from the Book of Mormon. \u201cNothing is hopeless in God\u2019s eyes,\u201d Seth told worshippers.</p> <p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was founded in 1830 by a then-24-year-old Vermont-born Joseph Smith. To this day, anyone considering themselves to be a Latter-day Saint still reveres Smith. Fundamentalist Mormons, the ones who are not part of the mainstream church, and often practice polygamy, believe in following his original teachings, including a revelation Smith<a href=\"https://www.lds.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng\"> said he received three times between 1834 and 1842</a>: Smith told associates that an angel appeared to him and told him to practice plural marriage. Historians believe Smith married his first plural wife in Kirtland, Ohio, in the mid-1830s. Smith died in 1844.</p> <p>Today, some fundamentalist Mormon polygamists<a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/polygamy/2018/08/04/girls-polygamous-kingston/\"> believe plural marriage is necessary to reach</a> the highest level of heaven.

Even though Mormon polygamists all trace their beliefs to the same place, they have had disagreements. The groups have tended to isolate themselves within specific<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/28/utah-strikes-down-polygamy-ban-sister-wives\"> neighborhoods in metropolitan Salt Lake City</a> or locations in the Utah or Arizona deserts.</p> <p>While most of the disputes have been peaceful, the most infamous episodes happened in the 1970s when a polygamist named Ervil LeBaron<a href=\"http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=52888886&amp;itype=CMSID\"> ordered the murders</a> of rival polygamous leaders and others who he thought offended God. One of the victims in 1977 was<a href=\"http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=4654859&amp;itype=CMSID\"> Rulon Allred</a>, who founded the AUB. He was shot to death in his chiropractic clinic in Salt Lake City.</p> <p>Today some of LeBaron and Allred\u2019s relations live among the polygamists near Humansville. The Ranch has residents who hail from at least three distinct polygamous sects, plus what are known as independents. Those are people with fundamentalist Mormon beliefs who do not affiliate with a church.</p> <p>Anderson would qualify as one of those. He was born in Mexico to a Mexican mother and American father. Anderson developed a belief in fundamental Mormonism. He had two wives for a time, but those marriages dissolved.</p> <p>He and his current wife, Clara Anderson, moved to the Ranch in the fall with their six children. Clara, 39, is one of Rulon Allred\u2019s great-granddaughters.</p> <p>Within their household, the Andersons admit the roles are traditional. Sean works in construction and is a part owner of a barbecue restaurant while his wife stays home.</p> <p>\u201cI stay home with my kids because I want to stay home with my kids,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not because Sean told me to stay home.\u201d</p> <p>Women from the Ranch are weary of the public perception of wives in polygamy as trapped inside a home. Some women hold jobs in the surrounding communities and some don\u2019t.</p> <p>A review of marriage licenses in south-west Missouri shows most residents of the polygamous community marry in their 20s, though a few brides and grooms have been as young as 17. In Mormon polygamy, the husband usually has one legal wife; subsequent marriages are ordained in a religious service, but there\u2019s no license on file with any county clerk.</p> <p>In Missouri, you can be convicted of bigamy if a married person \u201cpurports\u201d,<a href=\"http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=568.010&amp;bid=29498&amp;hl=\"> to quote the statute</a>, to marry another person. The offense is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail. That\u2019s a lesser punishment than, say, Utah, where<a href=\"http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=5038338&amp;itype=CMSID\"> polygamy is a felony</a> punishable by up to five years in prison or 15 years if it\u2019s committed in conjunction with a<a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/xcode/title76/chapter7/76-7-s101.html\"> fraud or violent offense</a>.</p> <p>Cedar county prosecutor Ty Gaither, one of the locals who refer to the polygamous community as The Compound, said he has not received any complaints about crimes there. He points out his county is home to multiple religious communities, including Amish and Mennonite.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s put it this way,\u201d Gaither said of a plural marriage, \u201cif I had three parties who were consenting adults, I wouldn\u2019t have a complaining witness. If I had a complaining witness, we would take a look.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adbec2a74618f8e8d2a5addc01bb50e6da6f6cbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adbec2a74618f8e8d2a5addc01bb50e6da6f6cbb/0_0_3000_1825/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A string of mailboxes lines one of the many private roads on The Ranch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"608\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A string of mailboxes lines one of the many private roads on the Ranch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liv Paggiarino/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Those who left</strong></h2> <p>As they finished lunch, Flint, Michelle and Ruth Anne Laub talked more about some of the perceptions people have of their family.</p> <p>Over the years, some have asked if the community has a relationship to<a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/polygamy/2018/01/10/polygamist-leader-warren-jeffs-is-accused-of-horrific-sex-abuse-again-and-people-on-the-utah-arizona-line-may-have-to-pay-again/\"> Warren Jeffs</a>, the president of the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/08/its-a-revolution-polygamist-sect-loses-power-over-utah-town-for-first-time\"> Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</a> who is serving a sentence of life plus 20 years in prison for crimes related to sexually abusing two girls he married as plural wives. (The answer is no; there are no known Jeffs followers at the Ranch.)</p> <p>The spouses also discussed the changes they have seen in the community. The AUB leaders in Utah were never pleased with those who moved to Missouri and as a result, the two communities have had little relationship in the last 35 years.</p> <p>People have come and gone over the years. Compton, one of those Motoqua men who drove to Missouri in the blue pickup truck, didn\u2019t find everything he was looking for on those 600 acres that was supposed to be Zion.</p> <p>Compton says living in a plural marriage and a united order gave him a lot of questions and not enough answers about God. Before he moved to Missouri, Compton came across a book about Jewish Kabbalah during a work trip to California.</p> <p>Kabbalah is meant to explain the relationship between God and the universe. Compton developed an interest in metaphysics. The other Motoqua men didn\u2019t like it. They believed metaphysics conflicted with their fundamentalist Mormon beliefs. They eventually asked Compton to leave.</p> <p>Compton separated from his plural wives, remarried to just one woman, and now leads a church in nearby Buffalo, Missouri, where he preaches a belief in an almighty creator. He\u2019ll teach from the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Torah, the Qur\u2019an or any other text promoting monotheism.</p> <p>\u201cI search for truth,\u201d Compton said.</p> <p>You can also buy a psychic reading from Compton and his wife, Connie Compton. The client will share certain information that Bruce relays to Connie. Through a trance, she will give advice or tell the client the cause of any physical or emotional ailments.</p> <p>As for what\u2019s next at what people call either the Compound or the Ranch, the residents years ago poured a concrete foundation for a temple against a small slope near the center of the community.</p> <p>No one seems to know when the rest of the temple will be constructed, or whether it will take the impetus of the residents or direction from God.</p> <p>\u2022 This piece was co-published with the Salt Lake Tribune.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Salt Lake Tribune\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt; &lt;base href=&quot;.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body style=&quot;padding: 0px; margin: 0px; overflow: hidden;&quot;&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/libs/iframe-messenger/iframeMessenger.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  &lt;script&gt;  iframeMessenger.enableAutoResize();  &lt;/script&gt;  &lt;meta content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt; &lt;link href=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/gia/fonts/v1/fonts.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt; &lt;style&gt;  .wrapper{  padding: 0;  position: relative;  border-top: 1px solid #dcdcdc;  }  h1{  font-family: 'Guardian Egyptian Web', Georgia, serif;  font-weight: 900;  color: #121212;  }  .boxout-primary-content{  padding-top: 3px;  margin-top: 6px;  margin-bottom: 24px;  font-family: 'Guardian Text Sans Web', sans-serif;  color: #121212;  font-size: 14px;  line-height: 1.3;  }    a {  color: #ad0006;  border-bottom: 1px solid #dcdcd;  }    a:hover {  border-bottom-color: #ad0006;  }    .logo {  max-width: 250px;  width: 100%;  margin-top: 12px;  }  &lt;/style&gt;    &lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;img class='logo' src='https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2018/11/19/salet_lake_tribune.png'/&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;boxout-primary-content&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href='https://www.sltrib.com' target=&quot;_parent&quot;&gt;The Salt Lake Tribune&lt;/a&gt;, Utah's independent voice.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Nate Carlisle, who has been a reporter at the Salt Lake Tribune since 2005, has intermittently covered polygamy since 2006</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "After church, Flint Laub, his two wives and their 10 children sat down at the kitchen table to eat pizza. The lunch was served in the big house, where Michelle Laub, 32, and her seven children live. Flint\u2019s second wife is Ruth Anne Laub, who is 25 and Michelle\u2019s half-sister. She recently gave birth to her third child. Ruth Anne Laub and her kids live in a second house a few steps away from the big one. The Laubs live in a polygamous community of perhaps 400 people in rural Missouri between the towns of Humansville and Stockton. The residents call it \u201cthe Ranch\u201d, though the agriculture is limited to a hay field and a few cows and chickens. People in the neighboring towns refer to the community as \u201cthe Compound\u201d, but you won\u2019t see any high walls or armed guards \u2014 just brown dirt roads winding through clusters of trees and homes. Inside the big house, the adults laughed about what outsiders think of them. Flint, 40, runs a roofing company. If someone asks him if he\u2019s a polygamist, he will say yes. Sometimes people will ask if the Compound is really prepped for warfare, assuming they are survivalists (they\u2019re not). Ruth Anne, who has worked as a first responder in Stockton, says one day someone asked her if she believed in air conditioning. Yes, she said. Her house is modern; constructed from concrete poured into plastic foam. \u201cIt probably bothers me that people think that\u2019s who we are,\u201d Ruth Anne said, \u201cbut it\u2019s funny, too.\u201d \u201cIf I was raised outside the religion,\u201d Flint said, \u201cand heard about people with multiple wives, I would think that\u2019s pretty crazy, too.\u201d In God\u2019s eyes \u201cI believe Missouri is the promised land,\u201d said Sean Anderson, a 51-year-old fundamentalist Mormon from Mexico who has also lived in Arizona and Utah. He recently moved to The Ranch with his wife and their six children. The residents are a hodgepodge of people whose members in Utah haven\u2019t always gotten along. But here, the polygamists worship not only with each other, but also with the Mormon church, also known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which officially abandoned polygamy in 1890 and excommunicates members found practicing it. Despite their differences, the mainstream Latter-day Saints and people on The Ranch still share core beliefs, and the community still uses its texts. This week, Seth Laub, an elder in the congregation, gave a lesson from the Book of Mormon. \u201cNothing is hopeless in God\u2019s eyes,\u201d Seth told worshippers. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was founded in 1830 by a then-24-year-old Vermont-born Joseph Smith. To this day, anyone considering themselves to be a Latter-day Saint still reveres Smith. Fundamentalist Mormons, the ones who are not part of the mainstream church, and often practice polygamy, believe in following his original teachings, including a revelation Smith said he received three times between 1834 and 1842: Smith told associates that an angel appeared to him and told him to practice plural marriage. Historians believe Smith married his first plural wife in Kirtland, Ohio, in the mid-1830s. Smith died in 1844. Today, some fundamentalist Mormon polygamists believe plural marriage is necessary to reach the highest level of heaven. Others practice polygamy simply to follow Smith\u2019s teachings. These polygamists tend to believe in big families: women often give birth to 10 or more children. While some of the polygamist leaders have been known to have 20 or more wives, most men have two or three. A voice on the mountain The idea of The Ranch emerged on 7 November 1983, when Stephen Laub was at his home in Motoqua, an enclave in south-west Utah for members of a polygamous church called the Apostolic United Brethren, or AUB. He was in the cellar, stocking and preparing it to ride out an apocalypse at the end of the millennium, when he heard someone call his name. He went to his wives to ask what they wanted. They said they didn\u2019t call him and didn\u2019t hear a voice. He heard the voice over eight days. Eventually, he tracked the voice to a nearby mountain. He started hiking. The voice had more instructions as he hiked farther up the mountain. As he recorded in his journal: \u201cThe Lord told me he wants me to go to Missouri and buy a farm.\u201d For Mormons of all stripes, Missouri \u2013 specifically Jackson county \u2013 is a landmark. Mormons began arriving there in 1831 and that year, Smith had a prophecy that Zion was in Jackson county and that Jesus would return there one day. But Latter-day Saints had conflicts with other Missouri settlers over land, commerce and governance and by 1838, violence got so bad modern textbooks call it the Missouri Mormon wwar. The ugliest episode happened that year, when 17 Latter-day Saints and one sympathizer were massacred at a place called Haun\u2019s Mill. Latter-day Saints soon began leaving the state. When Laub hiked down from the mountain and arrived home, his brother Derril Laub and another resident, Bruce Compton, were there to help him with the cellar. He told them they needed to go to Missouri. Because Latter-day Saints believe their movement started with a revelation from God, no one challenged him. They did ask where in Missouri they were supposed to go. To provide them with an answer, Stephen Laub hiked back up the mountain to seek a clarification. God told him to go about 100 miles south of Independence. The next day, the Laub brothers, some of their sons, Compton and another resident named Kent Andra loaded into a blue pickup truck and began driving east. \u201cThe idea was to build the kingdom of God, establish Zion,\u201d Compton, now 76, said in a recent interview. The men stopped in St George, Utah to make a phone call. It was to the president of their church, Owen Allred, in Salt Lake City. Stephen conveyed his plan. Allred didn\u2019t like it. After being driven from Missouri, the early leaders of the Latter-day Saints issued prophecies saying God\u2019s wrath would be visited upon western Missouri. While some Mormons believe the burned towns and bloodshed western Missouri suffered during the American Civil War fulfilled the prophecy and wiped the slate clean, Allred was among those who thought Missouri still had it coming. He told Stephen to go look at Missouri, but not to buy anything. The truck stopped in Fort Scott, Kansas, just across the state line from Missouri. The men went into a real estate office, where one of the men saw a pamphlet advertising 600 acres between the Missouri towns of Stockton and Humansville. It was a wooded, undeveloped property on one of the Ozark mountains\u2019 massive plateaus. The men drove to the 600 acres to inspect it. They had found their place. The men negotiated a purchase price of $300 an acre and paid $3,000 earnest money. They promised to make a down payment of $34,000 within 30 days. That was money the men didn\u2019t have when they made the agreement. Other believers back in Utah chipped in, and the financing of the property has become part of its mythology \u2014 proof that God wanted the believers to be in southwest Missouri. The group contributions were also the first example of ranch residents practicing what\u2019s called a United Order, a fundamentalist Mormon form of communal living where followers give money, entire pieces of property or time and talents to benefit the community. A unique spot At a coffee shop in Stockton, Missouri, on a blustery November day, Anderson explained what he liked about living out at the Ranch. He\u2019s a two-hour drive from Jackson county for the day Christ returns; he also likes that he can have discussions of Mormon doctrine with other residents without fear of offending someone. \u201cThey may not agree with me,\u201d Anderson said, \u201cand they aren\u2019t going to ostracize me.\u201d That makes the Ranch a unique spot. Even though Mormon polygamists all trace their beliefs to the same place, they have had disagreements. The groups have tended to isolate themselves within specific neighborhoods in metropolitan Salt Lake City or locations in the Utah or Arizona deserts. While most of the disputes have been peaceful, the most infamous episodes happened in the 1970s when a polygamist named Ervil LeBaron ordered the murders of rival polygamous leaders and others who he thought offended God. One of the victims in 1977 was Rulon Allred, who founded the AUB. He was shot to death in his chiropractic clinic in Salt Lake City. Today some of LeBaron and Allred\u2019s relations live among the polygamists near Humansville. The Ranch has residents who hail from at least three distinct polygamous sects, plus what are known as independents. Those are people with fundamentalist Mormon beliefs who do not affiliate with a church. Anderson would qualify as one of those. He was born in Mexico to a Mexican mother and American father. Anderson developed a belief in fundamental Mormonism. He had two wives for a time, but those marriages dissolved. He and his current wife, Clara Anderson, moved to the Ranch in the fall with their six children. Clara, 39, is one of Rulon Allred\u2019s great-granddaughters. Within their household, the Andersons admit the roles are traditional. Sean works in construction and is a part owner of a barbecue restaurant while his wife stays home. \u201cI stay home with my kids because I want to stay home with my kids,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not because Sean told me to stay home.\u201d Women from the Ranch are weary of the public perception of wives in polygamy as trapped inside a home. Some women hold jobs in the surrounding communities and some don\u2019t. A review of marriage licenses in south-west Missouri shows most residents of the polygamous community marry in their 20s, though a few brides and grooms have been as young as 17. In Mormon polygamy, the husband usually has one legal wife; subsequent marriages are ordained in a religious service, but there\u2019s no license on file with any county clerk. In Missouri, you can be convicted of bigamy if a married person \u201cpurports\u201d, to quote the statute, to marry another person. The offense is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail. That\u2019s a lesser punishment than, say, Utah, where polygamy is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison or 15 years if it\u2019s committed in conjunction with a fraud or violent offense. Cedar county prosecutor Ty Gaither, one of the locals who refer to the polygamous community as The Compound, said he has not received any complaints about crimes there. He points out his county is home to multiple religious communities, including Amish and Mennonite. \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way,\u201d Gaither said of a plural marriage, \u201cif I had three parties who were consenting adults, I wouldn\u2019t have a complaining witness. If I had a complaining witness, we would take a look.\u201d Those who left As they finished lunch, Flint, Michelle and Ruth Anne Laub talked more about some of the perceptions people have of their family. Over the years, some have asked if the community has a relationship to Warren Jeffs, the president of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints who is serving a sentence of life plus 20 years in prison for crimes related to sexually abusing two girls he married as plural wives. (The answer is no; there are no known Jeffs followers at the Ranch.) The spouses also discussed the changes they have seen in the community. The AUB leaders in Utah were never pleased with those who moved to Missouri and as a result, the two communities have had little relationship in the last 35 years. People have come and gone over the years. Compton, one of those Motoqua men who drove to Missouri in the blue pickup truck, didn\u2019t find everything he was looking for on those 600 acres that was supposed to be Zion. Compton says living in a plural marriage and a united order gave him a lot of questions and not enough answers about God. Before he moved to Missouri, Compton came across a book about Jewish Kabbalah during a work trip to California. Kabbalah is meant to explain the relationship between God and the universe. Compton developed an interest in metaphysics. The other Motoqua men didn\u2019t like it. They believed metaphysics conflicted with their fundamentalist Mormon beliefs. They eventually asked Compton to leave. Compton separated from his plural wives, remarried to just one woman, and now leads a church in nearby Buffalo, Missouri, where he preaches a belief in an almighty creator. He\u2019ll teach from the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Torah, the Qur\u2019an or any other text promoting monotheism. \u201cI search for truth,\u201d Compton said. You can also buy a psychic reading from Compton and his wife, Connie Compton. The client will share certain information that Bruce relays to Connie. Through a trance, she will give advice or tell the client the cause of any physical or emotional ailments. As for what\u2019s next at what people call either the Compound or the Ranch, the residents years ago poured a concrete foundation for a temple against a small slope near the center of the community. No one seems to know when the rest of the temple will be constructed, or whether it will take the impetus of the residents or direction from God. \u2022 This piece was co-published with the Salt Lake Tribune.

In a court hearing over his early deal to build a casino in Macau, Sheldon quipped that he\u2019d been told not to discuss the touchy subject of gambling when he met with China\u2019s vice premier in 2001. \u201cI was a good boy, like when my wife tells me to shut up, I shut up,\u201d he said, according to the <a href=\"https://lasvegassun.com/news/2008/apr/19/even-court-iconoclast/\">Las Vegas Sun</a>. </p> <p>The couple met on a blind date after Sheldon told a friend he\u2019d like to date an Israeli woman.

Her grandparents and extended family were killed in the Holocaust. \u201cThey raised me to foster and fight for liberty \u2013 for myself, for my people, for wider humankind, and at all times,\u201d Miriam once wrote in a column. She described serving as a medical research officer in the Israel Defense Forces and developed an interest in treating drug dependency partly after helping prostitutes who took to the streets to feed their addictions. The Israeli Ministry of Health recommended Miriam to study at Rockefeller University in 1986 under Dr Mary Jeanne Kreek, a leading researcher in the discovery of methadone as a heroin addiction treatment. Kreek became Miriam\u2019s mentor and friend. Two years after her arrival in New York, Miriam asked Kreek and her husband to come to dinner with a man she was dating. It was Sheldon.</p> <p>Kreek describes Miriam as \u201cdriven by science, medicine helping people suffering from addictive diseases\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI will tell you that Miriam didn\u2019t feed off of Sheldon,\u201d says Kreek. \u201cMiriam helped shape Sheldon and make him who he is today.\u201d</p> <p>The Adelsons married in Jerusalem in 1991, honeymooning in Venice, where Sheldon has credited Miriam with having the idea to theme his first Las Vegas casino as the Venetian, building a canal with gondoliers and replicating details of many of the city\u2019s famous palazzos.</p> <p>Federal election records reflect that Sheldon\u2019s first political donation, in 1984, was $1,000 to the Democratic candidate from Massachusetts for US Senate, John Kerry. Miriam\u2019s US political contributions began in 1991 \u2013 also to Democrats. Yet by the late 1990s, the majority of the Adelsons\u2019 support went to Republicans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"071d85136cdb4aae07a31cc4141630fb076e6572\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/071d85136cdb4aae07a31cc4141630fb076e6572/0_15_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani kisses the hand of Miriam Adelson before the first presidential debate in September 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani kisses the hand of Miriam Adelson before the first presidential debate in September 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Former Nevada senator Harry Reid says labor disagreements triggered Sheldon\u2019s shift to the right. \u201cHe had a beef he couldn\u2019t settle with the unions,\u201d Reid says. \u201cThat was what did it.\u201d</p> <p>The Adelsons\u2019 ambitions in politics were unleashed by a 2010 US supreme court ruling, Citizens United v FEC, which removed limits on political spending by corporations. Two years later, Sheldon told Reese he planned to give several million dollars to support Newt Gingrich\u2019s unlikely presidential campaign, and subsequently forked over a total of $20m. Reese recalls that he told Sheldon, \u201cit\u2019s going to change everything. You guys are testing a new law.\u201d</p> <p>In this year\u2019s midterms, their donations went largely to Republican candidates, and political action committees supporting them, across the country.</p> <p>Politics are by no means the Adelsons\u2019 main preoccupation. Miriam founded an addiction treatment clinic in Tel Aviv in 1993 and a second in Las Vegas in 2000, where she is said to don a white lab coat and treat patients. \u201cShe runs the meetings. She\u2019s got time for everybody. I just think she walks on water,\u201d says Cherry. He adds, \u201cI can\u2019t stand Sheldon\u2019s political views. I\u2019m a Democrat.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Parrino, the president of the American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence, describes the Las Vegas clinic as \u201ca very good clinic\u201d. Reid, for his part, calls Miriam a \u201cvisionary\u201d.</p> <p>Raising their two sons in Las Vegas, the Adelsons have also given an estimated $100m to turn the region\u2019s Hebrew day school into a preschool-through-12th-grade institution.</p> <p>The school philosophy promotes \u201cAdelson values\u201d \u2013 described on its website as associated \u201cwith the Hebrew word ruach, which translates as spirit or soul\u201d. Each morning, students recite the US pledge of allegiance, then sing the \u201cHatikvah,\u201d Israel\u2019s national anthem, says Matt Boland, the school\u2019s director of marketing and communications.</p> <p>The most radical thing about the school may be its enforcement of a stringent no-drugs policy. Every student and employee is required to be randomly drug tested three to four times per year. Miriam does some of the testing herself, Boland says. Those who fail a test are privately counseled, with education about the physical and mental effect of drugs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfbfd1b7cde24fba275b49eb655ed7f1a0051475\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfbfd1b7cde24fba275b49eb655ed7f1a0051475/0_82_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miriam Adelson took over as the publisher of the daily newspaper Israel Hayom this summer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miriam Adelson took over as the publisher of the daily newspaper Israel Hayom this summer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Baz Ratner/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Adelsons jet frequently from Las Vegas to Tel Aviv, and they pushed for the controversial transfer of the US embassy to Jerusalem, offering to pay for its cost in the face of vociferous international condemnation. \u201cHe was able to get Trump to move the embassy,\u201d says liberal political commentator Noam Sheizaf. \u201cHe is one of the most important players around Israeli politics and very controversial. \u2026 Everything Adelson says or does is news in Israel right now.\u201d</p> <p>The question is which Adelson is in the driver\u2019s seat. Miriam, who appears to many around her to be the unrecognized ideological force behind many of the couple\u2019s causes, may be seeking a more public role. She took over this summer as publisher of the Israel Hayom, the free Hebrew language daily newspaper that the Adelsons founded and she owns. </p> <p>Sometimes called Israel\u2019s Fox News for its conservative stances, the paper is Israel\u2019s most-read daily and is sometimes called the \u201cBibiton\u201d \u2013 a combination of conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s nickname and the Hebrew word for newspaper. The Adelsons have a long friendship with the embattled Netanyahu, who has referred to Sheldon as \u201cthe gingy\u201d for his reddish hair.</p> <p>To Miriam and many around her, Trump\u2019s medal caps a lifetime of strident effort. At the ceremony, Kreek sat in the fourth row. Miriam wore a bright red dress she had made for the occasion. She described the experience in a column for Israel Hayom:</p> <p>\u201cWhen (Trump) clasped America\u2019s highest civilian honor around my neck, I was euphoric with wonderment and gratitude,\u201d she wrote.

She described serving as a medical research officer in the Israel Defense Forces and developed an interest in treating drug dependency partly after helping prostitutes who took to the streets to feed their addictions. The Israeli Ministry of Health recommended Miriam to study at Rockefeller University in 1986 under Dr Mary Jeanne Kreek, a leading researcher in the discovery of methadone as a heroin addiction treatment. Kreek became Miriam\u2019s mentor and friend. Two years after her arrival in New York, Miriam asked Kreek and her husband to come to dinner with a man she was dating. It was Sheldon. Kreek describes Miriam as \u201cdriven by science, medicine helping people suffering from addictive diseases\u201d. \u201cI will tell you that Miriam didn\u2019t feed off of Sheldon,\u201d says Kreek. \u201cMiriam helped shape Sheldon and make him who he is today.\u201d The Adelsons married in Jerusalem in 1991, honeymooning in Venice, where Sheldon has credited Miriam with having the idea to theme his first Las Vegas casino as the Venetian, building a canal with gondoliers and replicating details of many of the city\u2019s famous palazzos. Federal election records reflect that Sheldon\u2019s first political donation, in 1984, was $1,000 to the Democratic candidate from Massachusetts for US Senate, John Kerry. Miriam\u2019s US political contributions began in 1991 \u2013 also to Democrats. Yet by the late 1990s, the majority of the Adelsons\u2019 support went to Republicans. Former Nevada senator Harry Reid says labor disagreements triggered Sheldon\u2019s shift to the right. \u201cHe had a beef he couldn\u2019t settle with the unions,\u201d Reid says. \u201cThat was what did it.\u201d The Adelsons\u2019 ambitions in politics were unleashed by a 2010 US supreme court ruling, Citizens United v FEC, which removed limits on political spending by corporations. Two years later, Sheldon told Reese he planned to give several million dollars to support Newt Gingrich\u2019s unlikely presidential campaign, and subsequently forked over a total of $20m. Reese recalls that he told Sheldon, \u201cit\u2019s going to change everything. You guys are testing a new law.\u201d In this year\u2019s midterms, their donations went largely to Republican candidates, and political action committees supporting them, across the country. Politics are by no means the Adelsons\u2019 main preoccupation. Miriam founded an addiction treatment clinic in Tel Aviv in 1993 and a second in Las Vegas in 2000, where she is said to don a white lab coat and treat patients. \u201cShe runs the meetings. She\u2019s got time for everybody. I just think she walks on water,\u201d says Cherry. He adds, \u201cI can\u2019t stand Sheldon\u2019s political views. I\u2019m a Democrat.\u201d Mark Parrino, the president of the American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence, describes the Las Vegas clinic as \u201ca very good clinic\u201d. Reid, for his part, calls Miriam a \u201cvisionary\u201d. Raising their two sons in Las Vegas, the Adelsons have also given an estimated $100m to turn the region\u2019s Hebrew day school into a preschool-through-12th-grade institution. The school philosophy promotes \u201cAdelson values\u201d \u2013 described on its website as associated \u201cwith the Hebrew word ruach, which translates as spirit or soul\u201d. Each morning, students recite the US pledge of allegiance, then sing the \u201cHatikvah,\u201d Israel\u2019s national anthem, says Matt Boland, the school\u2019s director of marketing and communications. The most radical thing about the school may be its enforcement of a stringent no-drugs policy. Every student and employee is required to be randomly drug tested three to four times per year. Miriam does some of the testing herself, Boland says. Those who fail a test are privately counseled, with education about the physical and mental effect of drugs. The Adelsons jet frequently from Las Vegas to Tel Aviv, and they pushed for the controversial transfer of the US embassy to Jerusalem, offering to pay for its cost in the face of vociferous international condemnation. \u201cHe was able to get Trump to move the embassy,\u201d says liberal political commentator Noam Sheizaf. \u201cHe is one of the most important players around Israeli politics and very controversial. \u2026 Everything Adelson says or does is news in Israel right now.\u201d The question is which Adelson is in the driver\u2019s seat. Miriam, who appears to many around her to be the unrecognized ideological force behind many of the couple\u2019s causes, may be seeking a more public role. She took over this summer as publisher of the Israel Hayom, the free Hebrew language daily newspaper that the Adelsons founded and she owns. Sometimes called Israel\u2019s Fox News for its conservative stances, the paper is Israel\u2019s most-read daily and is sometimes called the \u201cBibiton\u201d \u2013 a combination of conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s nickname and the Hebrew word for newspaper. The Adelsons have a long friendship with the embattled Netanyahu, who has referred to Sheldon as \u201cthe gingy\u201d for his reddish hair. To Miriam and many around her, Trump\u2019s medal caps a lifetime of strident effort. At the ceremony, Kreek sat in the fourth row. Miriam wore a bright red dress she had made for the occasion. She described the experience in a column for Israel Hayom: \u201cWhen (Trump) clasped America\u2019s highest civilian honor around my neck, I was euphoric with wonderment and gratitude,\u201d she wrote. She thanked the president for his support in what appeared to be a reference to the US embassy move to Jerusalem. \u201cHe knows that one has to stand for what is right, even if that means standing alone.\u201d Christina Binkley is the author of the best-selling Las Vegas book Winner Takes All.",

Sales in its core Dunelm brand increased by nearly 10% to \u00a3304m in the 13 weeksto 29 December, boosted by a slicker online operation and the popularity of unicorn-themed goods, from bedding to rocking horses. A spokesman said sheepskin rugs had also proved popular with shoppers. The Leicestershire-based company\u2019s stock climbed by more than 11% on the back of the figures, which had to be released earlier than planned due to regulatory guidelines on financial updates that differ significantly from forecasts. Dunelm said it was cautious about making predictions due to \u201cunprecedented levels of uncertainty currently facing consumers and businesses in the UK\u201d but strong sales mean it is likely to report full-year profits modestly ahead of analysts\u2019 projections. The Dunelm chief executive, Nick Wilkinson, said: \u201cWe are pleased with our overall performance in the first half, and are helping more customers than ever to create a home they love. \u201cBy focusing back on our core business, under one Dunelm brand, we are improving our trading and financial performance.\u201d Wilkinson was referring to the completed integration of Worldstores, which Dunelm bought out of administration in 2016 and has previously proved a drag on profits due to low margins. Dunelm has jettisoned a range of less profitable products and shut down the websites of Worldstores\u2019 brands, including Kiddicare, focusing instead on using its website to improve sales of the highest margin products. The website is being revamped in a bid to capitalise on rising online sales, although the launch will be delayed until the company\u2019s fourth quarter, it said. While web sales proved the fastest-growing part of the business, up 38% during the period, overall web sales of \u00a336.1m are still a fraction of the \u00a3246m in revenues racked up in store.

      "bodyText": "US and Chinese officials held their first face-to-face negotiations since a 90-day truce was declared in a trade war between Washington and Beijing, in the hope of ending a bruising confrontation between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Hopes that the sixth round of negotiations between the two sides could yield a breakthrough helped Asian shares rise on Monday, combined with optimism about the state of the global economy on the back of strong US jobs figures on Friday. In Tokyo, the Nikkei soared more than 3% and there were also strong positive moves in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Sydney. Talks among mid-level US and Chinese trade representatives were scheduled for Monday and Tuesday. Chinese vice-premier and economic czar Liu He unexpectedly attended the talks, according to Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources. After failing to reach an agreement in December when Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met, both sides agreed to suspend tariff increases while holding discussions on technology transfers, as well as intellectual property theft and cybersecurity. If no agreement is reached, US tariffs on $200bn (\u00a3160bn) of Chinese goods will increase in March to 25% from the current 10%. Trump said on Sunday that China was under pressure to do a deal amid signs of a slowdown in its economy. \u201cI think China wants to get it resolved. Their economy\u2019s not doing well. I think that gives them a great incentive to negotiate,\u201d he said. Analysts believe the talks were unlikely to produce a major breakthrough but will lay important groundwork for an agreement that both sides appear increasingly eager to reach. \u201cThe situation now is that both sides are facing some economic problems. China is facing an export pressure and a likely economic downturn. The US is facing a falling stock market.

China\u2019s leaders in particular are under pressure to end a trade war that is exacerbating an already slowing Chinese economy in which exports, factory output, and consumer confidence have all declined. \u201cChina\u2019s slowdown is occurring across the board, affecting almost every industry and region,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a trade expert focused on China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cResolving the trade war or at least finding some common ground with Washington will be needed to fully restore confidence,\u201d he said. The delegation, led by the US deputy trade representative, Jeffrey Gerrish, does not include any top US officials from the administration, a sign the talks will be a precursor to higher-level meetings. Chinese vice-premier Liu He, may travel to Washington in February and Trump may meet the Chinese vice-president, Wang Qishan, at the World Economic Forum in Davos near the end of this month, according to reports. The US delegation includes officials from the Treasury, and energy and agriculture departments, as well as the State Department and the White House, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. \u201cIt promises to be the first time that the core of the agenda will centre around the problems caused by Chinese industrial policy and the need to marketise China\u2019s economy,\u201d said Kennedy. \u201cIf they can make sufficient progress on identifying the key issues and narrowing in on the possible solutions, that will pave the way for Chinese vice-premier Liu He to visit Washington in the coming weeks,\u201d he added. Key US exports including soya beans, corn and pork, as well as liquefied natural gas, are currently subject to retaliatory tariffs from China. China\u2019s industrial policy, \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d, which the US argues violates World Trade Organization rules, is likely to be a topic of discussion. China is likely to raise the issue of the telecoms firm Huawei, whose global ambitions have been thwarted by a US ban on its products. The arrest in Canada of a senior Huawei official, Meng Wanzhou, at the request of the US has spiralled into a diplomatic incident, which includes two Canadians still detained in China. Gerrish, the head of the US delegation, is likely to follow the lead of the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, one of the most hawkish members of the Trump administration.

      "body": "<h2>1) Lam asks for lineout law enforcement</h2> \n<p>Bristol\u2019s head coach, Pat Lam, has asked Twickenham to scrutinise the law governing the lineout, arguing that Exeter are regularly awarded tries that should be penalties to their opponents. The Chiefs won the West Country derby with two tries that followed lineouts.

People in the real world are generally all right, occasionally nasty but often unexpectedly lovely. That is magnified online. Look around you when next in a crowd. Most people will be fantastic. I\u2019d say 3% might be utterly vile. That small percentage now has access to abuse whoever they please. Years ago I interviewed CEOPs (child exploitation online protection command), when the internet was new. They discussed an obvious and self-evident truth. Online connections permit behaviour previously deemed reprehensible to become acceptable, as those with similar deplorable interests find each other online and encourage each other. The day my piece went live, people I have never met and do not follow but respected from a distance, piled in. Others, including Women In Journalism defended me, and Stuart Braithwaite of the band Mogwai gallantly appealed for calm. A well-known musician acquaintance kindly contacted me privately to say: \u201cAs with road rage the best thing you can do is get out of the situation as far and quietly as possible, without engaging anyone (tempting though that may be) and go off and enjoy something in life that is rewarding.\u201d They were right. A redeeming part of what has been personally a difficult few years has been my growing interest in birding, which has taught me that corvids attack and mob other vulnerable wounded birds. Welcome to the internet. The comedian Stewart Lee beautifully describes Twitter as \u201cthe stasi for the Angry Birds generation\u201d. When the pack next attacks, remember there\u2019s a person beneath all that manure. I am appalled by the real-life actions of various public figures who are widely lambasted \u2013 even threatened \u2013 online, but were they to suffer harm and be utterly destroyed we, as a species, will have failed. Behave on social media as you would in real life. Imagine you are queueing at a bus stop. If you found yourself part of a furious mob piously and self-righteously shouting abuse and gleeful vindictive fury at the person standing next to you, recruiting strangers to join in as your victim cowers in fear, like crows attacking a sparrow, you might want to reconsider your life choices. \u2022 Penny Anderson is a writer and artist",

Hawes said the industry was facing a perfect storm, \u201ccausing considerable agitation and worry in boardrooms in the UK\u201d, but argued that the declining sales were a wider problem than carmakers\u2019 own self-interest. \u201cSelling new vehicles is not just good for the industry \u2013 it\u2019s good for the consumer, the environment and the exchequer. We need coherent policies to encourage that.\u201d",

Here\u2019s a list of the quarterbacks the Texans faced prior to their playoff loss to Andrew Luck and the Colts: Tom Brady; Blaine Gabbert; Eli Manning; Luck; Dak Prescott; Nathan Peterman; Cody Kessler; Brock Osweiler; Case Keenum; Alex Smith; Marcus Mariota; Baker Mayfield; Luck; Sam Darnold; Nick Foles; Blake Bortles. Hardly a murderers row. Despite the less than stellar competition, the team finished with the 18th-best pass defense by DVOA. In his three games against the Texans defense (including his fourth game back from shoulder surgery) this year, Luck finished 86/135, with a 64% completion percentage, 966 yards, six touchdowns, and one interception. The Texans are much further away from a championship than their record would indicate.</p>",

Sometimes the best deals in life are the ones you don\u2019t make. -- Think about this: the 12-4 Chargers traveled all the way to Baltimore to beat the 10-6 Ravens. Now, they get to travel all the way to New England to play the 11-5 Patriots. The Chargers worked all season to secure the second-best record in their conference. They\u2019ve been rewarded with two cross-country trips, one an early kickoff. The NFL needs to rethink its playoff seedings. Guarantee division winners a spot in the playoffs, but seed the tournament by overall record. -- The Texans had a good season, but much of their success was a mirage. Here\u2019s a list of the quarterbacks the Texans faced prior to their playoff loss to Andrew Luck and the Colts: Tom Brady; Blaine Gabbert; Eli Manning; Luck; Dak Prescott; Nathan Peterman; Cody Kessler; Brock Osweiler; Case Keenum; Alex Smith; Marcus Mariota; Baker Mayfield; Luck; Sam Darnold; Nick Foles; Blake Bortles. Hardly a murderers row. Despite the less than stellar competition, the team finished with the 18th-best pass defense by DVOA. In his three games against the Texans defense (including his fourth game back from shoulder surgery) this year, Luck finished 86/135, with a 64% completion percentage, 966 yards, six touchdowns, and one interception. The Texans are much further away from a championship than their record would indicate.",

Goodman explains that she didn\u2019t want a desk job, she wanted to meet people and face different challenges every day: a bit like a pop star, but without the croptops. \u201cI was always completely fascinated with babies and childbirth,\u201d she says, \u201cso I applied and got accepted. It was a shock to the system to start buying pencil cases when you\u2019d been doing what I had been, but I went back to university and got a first.\u201d</p> <p>The euphoria of performing on stage has been replaced with the longer-lasting satisfaction of helping people, but in a way she still has big hits: there was the time she delivered a baby in a car park, in minus 5C in the middle of winter. \u201cThe dad had to shove the baby up his jumper to keep it warm, while the mum was having a haemorrhage on the back seat,\u201d she says, terrifyingly. Suddenly forgetting your words at Party in the Park doesn\u2019t seem like quite such a big deal. \u201cAt the end of that shift I felt very good about myself,\u201d she laughs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5fea1304c325c3690b12befaed166eebd2231aad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fea1304c325c3690b12befaed166eebd2231aad/0_0_3410_4262/800.jpg\" alt=\"Kelle Bryan.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kelle Bryan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kelle Bryan was in Eternal, the biggest girl band of the 90s until the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/nov/08/all-43-spice-girls-songs-ranked\" title=\"\">Spice Girls</a>, so going back to education was hard. Not simply because of the funny looks she got, but because she wasn\u2019t sure she could hack it. \u201cI joined the band at 15 and didn\u2019t get to do further education, and to be fair I never thought I\u2019d be able to, because at school I was always told: \u2018You\u2019re black, you\u2019re stupid, you\u2019re this, you\u2019re that, you\u2019re the other.\u2019 Then I did my masters in artistic professional development, and was like: \u2018Actually I can do this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It took Bryan a while to get her business up and running. \u201cI was an absolute hustler,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI started with a pay-as-you-go mobile, fax machine and faked that I had an assistant.\u201d She assures me that the assistant who set up our interview is real. \u201cWhen I needed to make landline calls I would run to the telephone box, I\u2019m not kidding you, and answer the phone: \u2018Good afternoon, Red Hot Entertainment [the name of her former company].\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Fast forward 10 years and Bryan\u2019s business Advocate Agency is legit: she discovered the new Jasmine for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/20/guy-ritchie-aladdin-disney-joel-golby-mena-massoud-will-smith\" title=\"\">Disney\u2019s live-action remake of Aladdin</a> and gave Ricky Norwood his break on EastEnders. \u201cI was always told that I would amount to nothing when I was younger, so I\u2019m a big supporter of people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise be given the opportunity.

Her mother died, her boyfriend left her and she lost her house. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get out of bed,\u201d she recalls. It took a while but the thing that helped her through all the loss was yoga. \u201cIt really changed my life,\u201d she tells me at breakfast, minutes after I take a class with her in Covent Garden. \u201cI gave up all the naughty stuff I was doing, I stopped wanting to get drunk and I stopped smoking because I wanted to get up to go to yoga the next day.\u201d</p> <p>But the chakras were shaken when O\u2019Sullivan went to an ashram to become a teacher, \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop crying,\u201d she says, shaking her head. \u201cI thought I was going to be cutting a few poses and that would be it, but I was up at three in the morning, I had to meditate for two hours, my food was served on the floor, and I was fresh from London, the big \u2018I Am\u2019.\u201d She found the constant chanting eye roll-inducing at first, but by day three she was finally kissing goodbye to her pop star persona. \u201cThey said: \u2018Who\u2019s judging you, but you?\u2019 So I let it all go and it was amazing. For the first time, I felt free.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Sullivan qualified as an instructor years before it was trendy and still teaches yoga flow in central London and at juicing retreats around the world: Gary Barlow, Alesha Dixon and Jason Donovan are regulars.</p> <p>Every one of the women I spoke to seemed content with their new lives. While a cynical reader might believe that they secretly pine for their girl band glory days, the reasons they give for leaving the groups often sound potent enough to put them off pop for good. It all comes down to girl power: who has it and who doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cI distinctly remember my first meeting with the Honeyz,\u201d recalls Goodman, when she was the new girl replacing founding member Heavenli Denton in 1999, \u201cand one of the girls who was an inch shorter than me saying: \u2018Well she can\u2019t wear heels, because she can\u2019t be taller than me.\u2019 Then a bit later she said: \u2018You just don\u2019t seem grateful enough to be here.\u2019\u201d Goodman still can\u2019t quite believe the cheek, but this seems to be a recurring narrative: the manipulative double jab of \u2018How much do you want it?\u2019 and \u2018What are you prepared to sacrifice to keep it?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cIt got to the point where I was crying on my way to work,\u201d sighs Goodman, \u201cand obviously that\u2019s not what you dream of.\u201d</p> <p>Bryan reveals that as strained as it was, she eventually fell into a routine. \u201cI was almost numb. You put your game face on, don\u2019t you? Go to work, do your job, come home.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZBuIoiUMSA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CZBuIoiUMSA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Bananarama Mark II\u2019s video for Love, Truth and Honesty.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>When O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s feelings of being the outsider got too much, a self-fulfilling prophecy, she made things worse. \u201cI was a feral young girl, I\u2019d come from a band with a punk mentality (girl group the Shillelagh Sisters) and literally didn\u2019t wash, I was so wild, and when I joined this band that felt like a machine, I didn\u2019t deal with it very well. I was self-medicating, not turning up for interviews, and at the end it got so bad that Hillary [Shaw], our manager, would be ringing round hotels to see if I was there, cos we were supposed to be flying off to do a show.\u201d</p> <p>It becomes clear that some of our worst assumptions about girls in girl bands are true. When I ask Goodman to describe her time in Honeyz she says one word: \u201cDrama.\u201d Bryan claims that in Eternal the Bennett sisters controlled everything. \u201cI think they would agree that they come from a very strong family with a firm set of core beliefs \u2013 and coming into that was tough,\u201d she admits.</p> <p>Drama may be the name of Bananarama\u2019s excellent comeback album from 2005, but O\u2019Sullivan is keen to stress that there was none between them, not exactly. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t know when I joined the band, was that Sara [Dallin] and Keren [Woodward] had known each other since they were kids,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe never had horrible words ever but I was there to fill the space, and I got the impression that they would\u2019ve much rather gone on as a duo,\u201d which of course they did later, although fans have a fondness for the \u201cJacquie years\u201d and so does she. \u201cI hold no grudges. I didn\u2019t take any responsibility for myself and how I was acting back then and now I do. If I saw the girls I\u2019d be happy to give them a big hug.\u201d</p> <p>Goodman doesn\u2019t have much time for anything beyond her nine to five, but her experience in girl bands comes in surprisingly handy. \u201cThere\u2019s still a hierarchy in the NHS,\u201d she says, lowering her voice, \u201cbut I never respected that as a thing, because when you\u2019ve just come off stage at the O2, I\u2019m not going to be intimidated by some junior consultant.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "As jobs go, being in a girl band has to be up there with ice-cream taster, rollercoaster designer and being Cher. But what do you do when it\u2019s time to mothball the double denim and Buffalo boots? If you need to work, chances are you will look for something reliable that\u2019s more rewarding than having your bum digitally reduced so you\u2019re fit for public consumption. \u201cI wanted to do something where people don\u2019t constantly decide if you\u2019re good enough,\u201d explains Mariama Goodman, veteran of girl groups Honeyz and Solid HarmoniE. \u201cTo be in a career where if you work hard you do well.\u201d That career was midwifery. Goodman explains that she didn\u2019t want a desk job, she wanted to meet people and face different challenges every day: a bit like a pop star, but without the croptops. \u201cI was always completely fascinated with babies and childbirth,\u201d she says, \u201cso I applied and got accepted. It was a shock to the system to start buying pencil cases when you\u2019d been doing what I had been, but I went back to university and got a first.\u201d The euphoria of performing on stage has been replaced with the longer-lasting satisfaction of helping people, but in a way she still has big hits: there was the time she delivered a baby in a car park, in minus 5C in the middle of winter. \u201cThe dad had to shove the baby up his jumper to keep it warm, while the mum was having a haemorrhage on the back seat,\u201d she says, terrifyingly. Suddenly forgetting your words at Party in the Park doesn\u2019t seem like quite such a big deal. \u201cAt the end of that shift I felt very good about myself,\u201d she laughs. Kelle Bryan was in Eternal, the biggest girl band of the 90s until the Spice Girls, so going back to education was hard. Not simply because of the funny looks she got, but because she wasn\u2019t sure she could hack it. \u201cI joined the band at 15 and didn\u2019t get to do further education, and to be fair I never thought I\u2019d be able to, because at school I was always told: \u2018You\u2019re black, you\u2019re stupid, you\u2019re this, you\u2019re that, you\u2019re the other.\u2019 Then I did my masters in artistic professional development, and was like: \u2018Actually I can do this.\u2019\u201d It took Bryan a while to get her business up and running. \u201cI was an absolute hustler,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI started with a pay-as-you-go mobile, fax machine and faked that I had an assistant.\u201d She assures me that the assistant who set up our interview is real. \u201cWhen I needed to make landline calls I would run to the telephone box, I\u2019m not kidding you, and answer the phone: \u2018Good afternoon, Red Hot Entertainment [the name of her former company].\u2019\u201d Fast forward 10 years and Bryan\u2019s business Advocate Agency is legit: she discovered the new Jasmine for Disney\u2019s live-action remake of Aladdin and gave Ricky Norwood his break on EastEnders. \u201cI was always told that I would amount to nothing when I was younger, so I\u2019m a big supporter of people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise be given the opportunity. That\u2019s where I\u2019ve made my niche,\u201d she says. When Jacquie O\u2019Sullivan, the woman who replaced Bananarama\u2019s Siobhan Fahey in the group in 1988, found herself back in the real world she says had a \u201cmini breakdown\u201d. Her mother died, her boyfriend left her and she lost her house. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get out of bed,\u201d she recalls. It took a while but the thing that helped her through all the loss was yoga. \u201cIt really changed my life,\u201d she tells me at breakfast, minutes after I take a class with her in Covent Garden. \u201cI gave up all the naughty stuff I was doing, I stopped wanting to get drunk and I stopped smoking because I wanted to get up to go to yoga the next day.\u201d But the chakras were shaken when O\u2019Sullivan went to an ashram to become a teacher, \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop crying,\u201d she says, shaking her head. \u201cI thought I was going to be cutting a few poses and that would be it, but I was up at three in the morning, I had to meditate for two hours, my food was served on the floor, and I was fresh from London, the big \u2018I Am\u2019.\u201d She found the constant chanting eye roll-inducing at first, but by day three she was finally kissing goodbye to her pop star persona. \u201cThey said: \u2018Who\u2019s judging you, but you?\u2019 So I let it all go and it was amazing. For the first time, I felt free.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan qualified as an instructor years before it was trendy and still teaches yoga flow in central London and at juicing retreats around the world: Gary Barlow, Alesha Dixon and Jason Donovan are regulars. Every one of the women I spoke to seemed content with their new lives. While a cynical reader might believe that they secretly pine for their girl band glory days, the reasons they give for leaving the groups often sound potent enough to put them off pop for good. It all comes down to girl power: who has it and who doesn\u2019t. \u201cI distinctly remember my first meeting with the Honeyz,\u201d recalls Goodman, when she was the new girl replacing founding member Heavenli Denton in 1999, \u201cand one of the girls who was an inch shorter than me saying: \u2018Well she can\u2019t wear heels, because she can\u2019t be taller than me.\u2019 Then a bit later she said: \u2018You just don\u2019t seem grateful enough to be here.\u2019\u201d Goodman still can\u2019t quite believe the cheek, but this seems to be a recurring narrative: the manipulative double jab of \u2018How much do you want it?\u2019 and \u2018What are you prepared to sacrifice to keep it?\u2019 \u201cIt got to the point where I was crying on my way to work,\u201d sighs Goodman, \u201cand obviously that\u2019s not what you dream of.\u201d Bryan reveals that as strained as it was, she eventually fell into a routine. \u201cI was almost numb. You put your game face on, don\u2019t you? Go to work, do your job, come home.\u201d When O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s feelings of being the outsider got too much, a self-fulfilling prophecy, she made things worse. \u201cI was a feral young girl, I\u2019d come from a band with a punk mentality (girl group the Shillelagh Sisters) and literally didn\u2019t wash, I was so wild, and when I joined this band that felt like a machine, I didn\u2019t deal with it very well. I was self-medicating, not turning up for interviews, and at the end it got so bad that Hillary [Shaw], our manager, would be ringing round hotels to see if I was there, cos we were supposed to be flying off to do a show.\u201d It becomes clear that some of our worst assumptions about girls in girl bands are true. When I ask Goodman to describe her time in Honeyz she says one word: \u201cDrama.\u201d Bryan claims that in Eternal the Bennett sisters controlled everything. \u201cI think they would agree that they come from a very strong family with a firm set of core beliefs \u2013 and coming into that was tough,\u201d she admits. Drama may be the name of Bananarama\u2019s excellent comeback album from 2005, but O\u2019Sullivan is keen to stress that there was none between them, not exactly. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t know when I joined the band, was that Sara [Dallin] and Keren [Woodward] had known each other since they were kids,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe never had horrible words ever but I was there to fill the space, and I got the impression that they would\u2019ve much rather gone on as a duo,\u201d which of course they did later, although fans have a fondness for the \u201cJacquie years\u201d and so does she. \u201cI hold no grudges. I didn\u2019t take any responsibility for myself and how I was acting back then and now I do. If I saw the girls I\u2019d be happy to give them a big hug.\u201d Goodman doesn\u2019t have much time for anything beyond her nine to five, but her experience in girl bands comes in surprisingly handy. \u201cThere\u2019s still a hierarchy in the NHS,\u201d she says, lowering her voice, \u201cbut I never respected that as a thing, because when you\u2019ve just come off stage at the O2, I\u2019m not going to be intimidated by some junior consultant.\u201d",

Each night, hundreds of homeless children come looking for a place to sleep, sometimes two to a mattress.</p> <p>One house, run by 27-year-old Mabit and her family of six, hosts about two dozen children a night. She charges them 20 birr (50p) each, and cooks food to sell to them. The dormitories are damp and crowded, and some of the boys can be drunk and violent, but it\u2019s better than a night on the street.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like America,\u201d says Mabit, explaining the district\u2019s nickname. \u201cIt\u2019s a better place for the boys.\u201d</p> <p>Street children, especially young boys, have been increasingly visible in Addis Ababa in recent years. Thousands ply their trade at the city\u2019s traffic-choked intersections, some hawking cigarettes and chewing gum, others begging. Many clutch plastic bottles filled with glue from which they take regular sniffs.</p> <p>The last official survey was conducted as far back as 2010, but even then there were an estimated <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/about/execboard/files/Ethiopia_final_approved_2012-2015_20_Oct_2011.pdf\">12,000</a> <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/about/execboard/files/Ethiopia_final_approved_2012-2015_20_Oct_2011.pdf\">children</a> living unaccompanied on the streets of the capital.

Mabit, who has been renting beds to children for a decade, also reckons the numbers are rising, a view echoed by officials.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a very huge problem \u2013 and it\u2019s getting bigger and bigger,\u201d says Hunegnaw Ayele Abate, director of social protection at the city\u2019s bureau of labour and social affairs.</p> <p>Children as young as six come to the city to escape rural drudgery and, in many cases, family breakdown. \u201cThe reason is always poverty \u2013 but poverty plus [something else],\u201d says Lynn Kay, country director of <a href=\"https://www.retrak.org/\">Retrak</a> <a href=\"https://www.retrak.org/\">Ethiopia</a>, an organisation that rescues street children in Addis Ababa and reunites them with their families.</p> <p>One recent <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-addis-ababa-shouldnt-criminalise-children-who-beg-on-its-streets-95659\">survey</a> found that almost half the street children sampled were living with step-parents because their biological parents had died, divorced or separated.</p> <p>Chala, 15, from Hararghe in eastern Ethiopia, has knife scars all along his forearms. He came to Addis three years ago, after his mother died and his father started drinking, beating him and his five younger siblings. \u201cI was the breadwinner,\u201d he explains.</p> <p>Most come from rural villages, and especially from what researchers call Ethiopia\u2019s \u201csouthern corridor\u201d of migrant-sending communities, where a tradition of relocation to Addis Ababa and even further afield is well established.</p> <p>Sisay, 13, from the countryside surrounding the southern town of Shashamane, left for the capital two years ago with a large group of friends. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about Addis but my friends said it would be a really amazing place,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d68b8dc1f150385d8383b9f79c331e053e53587\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d68b8dc1f150385d8383b9f79c331e053e53587/0_0_2091_1394/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street kids in Addis Ababa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Back in 2010 there were estimated to be 12,000 children living on the streets of Addis Ababa</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Rosser</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of his peers in the capital are from southern areas like Wolayita, districts known for sending migrants to the capital.

Youth unemployment in some districts can be as high as 50 %. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-trafficking-economy/trafficked-into-slavery-the-dark-side-of-addis-ababas-growth-idUSKCN18C0O1\">Child</a> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-trafficking-economy/trafficked-into-slavery-the-dark-side-of-addis-ababas-growth-idUSKCN18C0O1\">trafficking</a> networks, which are often responsible for bringing girls to Addis Ababa, are particularly active.</p> <p>Life on the streets of the capital is unremittingly tough, even for those who earn enough each day to afford a bed in DC or similar quarters elsewhere. School is impossible without a city ID card, begging is stigmatised, and police brutality is commonplace. One charity reports that, when asked to draw a picture of life on the streets, almost all the children it works with sketch an image of a policeman. \u201cThe police treat us like we are goats,\u201d says Bedasa, 18, a friend of Chala.</p> <p>Girls usually end up in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-trafficking-economy/trafficked-into-slavery-the-dark-side-of-addis-ababas-growth-idUSKCN18C0O1\">domestic</a> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-trafficking-economy/trafficked-into-slavery-the-dark-side-of-addis-ababas-growth-idUSKCN18C0O1\">service</a>, where sexual abuse is rampant. The US state department\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2015/243436.htm\">2016</a> <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2015/243436.htm\">Trafficking in Persons report</a> found that girls as young as eight were working in brothels around Addis Ababa\u2019s central market. Kay says about 80% of girls who come to Retrak report sexual abuse, though she adds that a rising number of boys are reporting it too. Many contract hepatitis B, a liver infection that can be transmitted through sex.</p> <p>Charity workers say glue-sniffing has increased dramatically over the past couple of years. The substance is easy to obtain: souks sell 5ml in plastic bottles for only 10 birr and there is no age restriction. Shoeshine boys who use glue for repairing shoes say it is now too expensive because the bulk is being sold to children for sniffing. \u201cNobody stops them,\u201d says Muluken Seyoum, an official in the ministry of women and children affairs.</p> <p>Chala says he and his friends do it to stifle hunger and numb the cold at night. \u201cYou will forget everything for hours,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe know it\u2019s scary but we can\u2019t find a way to stop the addiction.\u201d Bedasa says it helps them cope with pain when they are beaten by police.</p> <p>There are no government programmes or facilities for street children. The only help comes from a handful of small-scale charities that receive little by way of government assistance. A restrictive <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/10/13/analysis-ethiopias-draft-civil-society-law\">civil</a> <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/10/13/analysis-ethiopias-draft-civil-society-law\">society law</a> makes it hard for them to operate. <a href=\"https://holdmyhandloved.org/?fbclid=IwAR2esAl31nUSxni4egQRaRDOZIy3UrFuBi7RzxGCIQ-qXFZJYdN_pLPtC1s\">Hold</a> <a href=\"https://holdmyhandloved.org/?fbclid=IwAR2esAl31nUSxni4egQRaRDOZIy3UrFuBi7RzxGCIQ-qXFZJYdN_pLPtC1s\">My Hand</a>, a shelter taking care of 26 boys, depends on the support of just two US donors. \u201cRaising children from the street is not our job,\u201d says founder Mikiyas Fekadu. \u201cBut we are doing it because [the government] is not.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/may/18/street-child-world-cup-2018-moscow\">Street Child World Cup: 'I lived on a train, surviving on leftover food' | Jo Griffin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government has instead pursued \u201ca correctional approach\u201d, says Tatek Abebe, an Ethiopian professor of childhood studies at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. This has involved police round-ups a couple of times a year, usually when the capital hosts African Union summits. Children are removed from the city and taken to nearby towns where they are given training and, in some cases, reunited with their families. The approach has been largely ineffective, though it is expected to continue.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a vicious circle \u2013 we pick them up; they come back again.

This year, the ministry of women and children affairs is using the motto \u201cChildren on the streets have a right to live\u201d \u2013 which, Kay argues, is a \u201cquantum leap away\u201d from its 2017 motto, \u201cCleaning Addis Ababa\u2019s streets of children\u201d. The civil society law is being revised and Fekadu says the government has started consulting with NGOs more.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Hunegnaw says his bureau\u2019s approach to rehabilitation and reintegration is changing, with more focus on education and vocational training to discourage children from returning to the streets. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned from the previous mistakes,\u201d he says. The bureau is also proposing the creation of a special centre offering shelter, food and sanitation. An <a href=\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/355471522246169734/Ethiopia-AFRICA-P151712-Urban-Productive-Safety-Net-Project-UPSNP-Procurement-Plan\">urban safety net</a> programme, launched in 2017 and supported by the World Bank, now helps some of the city\u2019s most destitute, including street children, by giving them a small cash handout.</p> <p>But the broader problem is more intractable. Street children are \u201cpart and parcel of the wider process of urbanisation\u201d says Tatek \u2013 and the population of Addis Ababa alone is expected to double to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/dec/04/addis-ababa-ethiopia-redesign-housing-project\">more than 8 million</a> over the next decade. Nationwide, the urbanisation rate is an estimated 4-6% a year, putting enormous pressure on municipal infrastructure and services. Despite the misery of life on the streets, the alternative \u2013 a permanent return to the countryside \u2013 is \u201cvery, very rare,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Among the street children Tatek has studied since 2005, not one has gone back permanently.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 10 January 2019 to clarify information about the programme of cash handouts for Addis Ababa\u2019s most destitute people.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Behind Addis Ababa\u2019s most iconic public space, Meskel Square, down a cobblestone alleyway in the shadow of half-finished high-rises, lies a small corner of the Ethiopian capital known by locals as \u201cDC\u201d. Nestled between cramped brothels and dimly lit bars, it consists of low-slung, tin-roofed dwellings containing rows of bunk beds. Each night, hundreds of homeless children come looking for a place to sleep, sometimes two to a mattress. One house, run by 27-year-old Mabit and her family of six, hosts about two dozen children a night. She charges them 20 birr (50p) each, and cooks food to sell to them. The dormitories are damp and crowded, and some of the boys can be drunk and violent, but it\u2019s better than a night on the street. \u201cIt\u2019s like America,\u201d says Mabit, explaining the district\u2019s nickname. \u201cIt\u2019s a better place for the boys.\u201d Street children, especially young boys, have been increasingly visible in Addis Ababa in recent years. Thousands ply their trade at the city\u2019s traffic-choked intersections, some hawking cigarettes and chewing gum, others begging. Many clutch plastic bottles filled with glue from which they take regular sniffs. The last official survey was conducted as far back as 2010, but even then there were an estimated 12,000 children living unaccompanied on the streets of the capital. NGOs estimate much higher figures today. Mabit, who has been renting beds to children for a decade, also reckons the numbers are rising, a view echoed by officials. \u201cWe have a very huge problem \u2013 and it\u2019s getting bigger and bigger,\u201d says Hunegnaw Ayele Abate, director of social protection at the city\u2019s bureau of labour and social affairs. Children as young as six come to the city to escape rural drudgery and, in many cases, family breakdown. \u201cThe reason is always poverty \u2013 but poverty plus [something else],\u201d says Lynn Kay, country director of Retrak Ethiopia, an organisation that rescues street children in Addis Ababa and reunites them with their families. One recent survey found that almost half the street children sampled were living with step-parents because their biological parents had died, divorced or separated. Chala, 15, from Hararghe in eastern Ethiopia, has knife scars all along his forearms. He came to Addis three years ago, after his mother died and his father started drinking, beating him and his five younger siblings. \u201cI was the breadwinner,\u201d he explains. Most come from rural villages, and especially from what researchers call Ethiopia\u2019s \u201csouthern corridor\u201d of migrant-sending communities, where a tradition of relocation to Addis Ababa and even further afield is well established. Sisay, 13, from the countryside surrounding the southern town of Shashamane, left for the capital two years ago with a large group of friends. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about Addis but my friends said it would be a really amazing place,\u201d he says. Many of his peers in the capital are from southern areas like Wolayita, districts known for sending migrants to the capital. Such areas are characterised by high population density and land fragmentation, putting extra pressure on poor households with large numbers of children. Youth unemployment in some districts can be as high as 50 %. Child trafficking networks, which are often responsible for bringing girls to Addis Ababa, are particularly active. Life on the streets of the capital is unremittingly tough, even for those who earn enough each day to afford a bed in DC or similar quarters elsewhere. School is impossible without a city ID card, begging is stigmatised, and police brutality is commonplace. One charity reports that, when asked to draw a picture of life on the streets, almost all the children it works with sketch an image of a policeman. \u201cThe police treat us like we are goats,\u201d says Bedasa, 18, a friend of Chala. Girls usually end up in domestic service, where sexual abuse is rampant. The US state department\u2019s 2016 Trafficking in Persons report found that girls as young as eight were working in brothels around Addis Ababa\u2019s central market. Kay says about 80% of girls who come to Retrak report sexual abuse, though she adds that a rising number of boys are reporting it too. Many contract hepatitis B, a liver infection that can be transmitted through sex. Charity workers say glue-sniffing has increased dramatically over the past couple of years. The substance is easy to obtain: souks sell 5ml in plastic bottles for only 10 birr and there is no age restriction. Shoeshine boys who use glue for repairing shoes say it is now too expensive because the bulk is being sold to children for sniffing. \u201cNobody stops them,\u201d says Muluken Seyoum, an official in the ministry of women and children affairs. Chala says he and his friends do it to stifle hunger and numb the cold at night. \u201cYou will forget everything for hours,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe know it\u2019s scary but we can\u2019t find a way to stop the addiction.\u201d Bedasa says it helps them cope with pain when they are beaten by police. There are no government programmes or facilities for street children. The only help comes from a handful of small-scale charities that receive little by way of government assistance. A restrictive civil society law makes it hard for them to operate. Hold My Hand, a shelter taking care of 26 boys, depends on the support of just two US donors. \u201cRaising children from the street is not our job,\u201d says founder Mikiyas Fekadu. \u201cBut we are doing it because [the government] is not.\u201d The government has instead pursued \u201ca correctional approach\u201d, says Tatek Abebe, an Ethiopian professor of childhood studies at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. This has involved police round-ups a couple of times a year, usually when the capital hosts African Union summits. Children are removed from the city and taken to nearby towns where they are given training and, in some cases, reunited with their families. The approach has been largely ineffective, though it is expected to continue. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a vicious circle \u2013 we pick them up; they come back again. It\u2019s a real headache for the government,\u201d says Muluken. There are hopes that the country\u2019s new administration, led by reformist prime minister Abiy Ahmed, will pursue a different tack. This year, the ministry of women and children affairs is using the motto \u201cChildren on the streets have a right to live\u201d \u2013 which, Kay argues, is a \u201cquantum leap away\u201d from its 2017 motto, \u201cCleaning Addis Ababa\u2019s streets of children\u201d. The civil society law is being revised and Fekadu says the government has started consulting with NGOs more. Meanwhile, Hunegnaw says his bureau\u2019s approach to rehabilitation and reintegration is changing, with more focus on education and vocational training to discourage children from returning to the streets. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned from the previous mistakes,\u201d he says. The bureau is also proposing the creation of a special centre offering shelter, food and sanitation. An urban safety net programme, launched in 2017 and supported by the World Bank, now helps some of the city\u2019s most destitute, including street children, by giving them a small cash handout. But the broader problem is more intractable. Street children are \u201cpart and parcel of the wider process of urbanisation\u201d says Tatek \u2013 and the population of Addis Ababa alone is expected to double to more than 8 million over the next decade. Nationwide, the urbanisation rate is an estimated 4-6% a year, putting enormous pressure on municipal infrastructure and services. Despite the misery of life on the streets, the alternative \u2013 a permanent return to the countryside \u2013 is \u201cvery, very rare,\u201d he says. Among the street children Tatek has studied since 2005, not one has gone back permanently. This article was amended on 10 January 2019 to clarify information about the programme of cash handouts for Addis Ababa\u2019s most destitute people.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cSuper League needed to freshen up, and that\u2019s probably putting it modestly.\u201d Barely five minutes have passed since the Dictaphone was switched on, and it is clear Robert Elstone is in no mood to mince his words. For months, the Super League chief executive has promised a revolution for British rugby league\u2019s elite competition amid a backdrop of boardroom politics but you sense the 54-year-old finally feels as though he is making progress as 2019 begins.</p> <p>Last week Super League unveiled its self-titled \u201cnew beginnings\u201d for 2019; a series of law changes aimed at revolutionising the image of the competition. Interchanges have been reduced, while shot clocks designed to speed up games and golden point extra-time are being implemented for 2019 \u2013 but Elstone\u2019s plans for change do not end there. \u201cSuper League will be different in 2019, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut you\u2019ll see a much better-looking competition in 2020 and the years after that. That\u2019s a guarantee.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/04/cash-dispute-could-see-catalan-dragons-not-defend-challenge-cup-crown-rugby-league\">Catalans may not defend Challenge Cup crown over \u00a3500,000 deposit dispute</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Expanding Super League\u2019s global reach is high on Elstone\u2019s agenda, underlined by the possibility that the traditional Magic Weekend could have an international flavour to it sooner rather than later, with Barcelona a likely venue for the event. In May, Catalans will host the reigning champions, Wigan, at the Camp Nou and while Magic will have a new home at Anfield in 2019, Elstone admits that the success of that game in Catalonia could set the stage for all 12 clubs to play in Barcelona at some point.</p> <p>\u201cIf that worked, then it would increase the chances of Magic going there without question,\u201d Elstone says. \u201cI think Wigan playing Catalans there is the most incredible development we\u2019ve had for years. It\u2019s a huge statement and it creates huge traction beyond our traditional circles. Super League has to get out of its own bubble, and the Nou Camp helps do that. It\u2019s not lost on me that our sport has a rebellious soul, and was founded out of injustice. If there\u2019s one region of the world that captures that, it\u2019s Catalonia.\u201d</p> <p>As the former Everton CEO begins to share his vision for a sport he began watching on the terraces of Castleford over 40 years ago, it is not difficult to see the strains of the first six months in the job showing. Most of that period was spent entrenched in a public dispute with prominent lower-league clubs about a restructure of the leagues in 2019, which was successfully achieved in September, with confirmation that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/12/super-league-scrap-super-8-format\" title=\"\">the Super 8s format would end in 2018</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6bf79dc56741d3208ecba2e723132110011dac9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6bf79dc56741d3208ecba2e723132110011dac9/662_905_3043_1826/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Super League CEO Robert Elstone (left) makes no apologies for following the lead of Australia\u2019s NRL\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Super League CEO Robert Elstone (left) makes no apologies for following the lead of Australia\u2019s NRL</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Paston/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite that victory, Elstone is in no mood to stand still. Next month he will move a new-look team of staff \u2013 many of whom have been poached from the RFL \u2013 out of the governing body\u2019s headquarters in Salford into the centre of Manchester, emphasising the differing directions of the two parties moving into 2019. Talk of a split between Super League and the RFL is not wide of the mark.</p> <p>\u201cGetting a group of people focused solely on Super League is well overdue,\u201d Elstone says. \u201cI don\u2019t think the competition got the focus that it should have had. A big part of all this is about giving the competition accountability. We\u2019re accountable for our actions now so there\u2019s a spotlight on us we\u2019re conscious of, but one we\u2019re excited about. We need to break out of our bubble and aim big for this competition.\u201d</p> <p>Part of Elstone\u2019s vision includes, by his own admission, looking to Australia\u2019s NRL for inspiration. \u201cI\u2019ll no doubt be branded an NRL sycophant,\u201d he smiles when explaining why Super League has emulated the NRL in adopting golden point extra-time. \u201cThe drama of a period of time to decide a winner excites me,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were a number of variations on the table, including golden try rather than golden point, but aligning ourselves with the NRL was the major factor.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t have enough recognisable stars at present, and that\u2019s high on our agenda</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Other significant changes will follow in 2020, including the introduction of two referees per game rather than one: a law amendment again inspired by the NRL. \u201cWe came close to doing it in 2019, and had club approvals and budgets signed off, but it was just too late,\u201d Elstone says. \u201cI\u2019m pretty confident you\u2019ll see it in 2020 though.

      "bodyText": "\u201cSuper League needed to freshen up, and that\u2019s probably putting it modestly.\u201d Barely five minutes have passed since the Dictaphone was switched on, and it is clear Robert Elstone is in no mood to mince his words. For months, the Super League chief executive has promised a revolution for British rugby league\u2019s elite competition amid a backdrop of boardroom politics but you sense the 54-year-old finally feels as though he is making progress as 2019 begins. Last week Super League unveiled its self-titled \u201cnew beginnings\u201d for 2019; a series of law changes aimed at revolutionising the image of the competition. Interchanges have been reduced, while shot clocks designed to speed up games and golden point extra-time are being implemented for 2019 \u2013 but Elstone\u2019s plans for change do not end there. \u201cSuper League will be different in 2019, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut you\u2019ll see a much better-looking competition in 2020 and the years after that. That\u2019s a guarantee.\u201d Expanding Super League\u2019s global reach is high on Elstone\u2019s agenda, underlined by the possibility that the traditional Magic Weekend could have an international flavour to it sooner rather than later, with Barcelona a likely venue for the event. In May, Catalans will host the reigning champions, Wigan, at the Camp Nou and while Magic will have a new home at Anfield in 2019, Elstone admits that the success of that game in Catalonia could set the stage for all 12 clubs to play in Barcelona at some point. \u201cIf that worked, then it would increase the chances of Magic going there without question,\u201d Elstone says. \u201cI think Wigan playing Catalans there is the most incredible development we\u2019ve had for years. It\u2019s a huge statement and it creates huge traction beyond our traditional circles. Super League has to get out of its own bubble, and the Nou Camp helps do that. It\u2019s not lost on me that our sport has a rebellious soul, and was founded out of injustice. If there\u2019s one region of the world that captures that, it\u2019s Catalonia.\u201d As the former Everton CEO begins to share his vision for a sport he began watching on the terraces of Castleford over 40 years ago, it is not difficult to see the strains of the first six months in the job showing. Most of that period was spent entrenched in a public dispute with prominent lower-league clubs about a restructure of the leagues in 2019, which was successfully achieved in September, with confirmation that the Super 8s format would end in 2018. Despite that victory, Elstone is in no mood to stand still. Next month he will move a new-look team of staff \u2013 many of whom have been poached from the RFL \u2013 out of the governing body\u2019s headquarters in Salford into the centre of Manchester, emphasising the differing directions of the two parties moving into 2019. Talk of a split between Super League and the RFL is not wide of the mark. \u201cGetting a group of people focused solely on Super League is well overdue,\u201d Elstone says. \u201cI don\u2019t think the competition got the focus that it should have had. A big part of all this is about giving the competition accountability. We\u2019re accountable for our actions now so there\u2019s a spotlight on us we\u2019re conscious of, but one we\u2019re excited about. We need to break out of our bubble and aim big for this competition.\u201d Part of Elstone\u2019s vision includes, by his own admission, looking to Australia\u2019s NRL for inspiration. \u201cI\u2019ll no doubt be branded an NRL sycophant,\u201d he smiles when explaining why Super League has emulated the NRL in adopting golden point extra-time. \u201cThe drama of a period of time to decide a winner excites me,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were a number of variations on the table, including golden try rather than golden point, but aligning ourselves with the NRL was the major factor.\u201d Other significant changes will follow in 2020, including the introduction of two referees per game rather than one: a law amendment again inspired by the NRL. \u201cWe came close to doing it in 2019, and had club approvals and budgets signed off, but it was just too late,\u201d Elstone says. \u201cI\u2019m pretty confident you\u2019ll see it in 2020 though. With the changes to speed the game up, it will put undoubted pressure on officials in 2019. We have to listen to referees and give them more help in-game, and a second referee does that.\u201d The Man of Steel award will change from an end-of-season dinner to a week-by-week voting process that is made public throughout, while the World Club Challenge will also receive a \u201clong-term focus\u201d as part of Elstone\u2019s plans for overhaul. Yet despite all that, Elstone concedes the challenge of giving Super League increased profile in a world where everyone is fighting for attention will be a difficult ask. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough recognisable stars at present, and that\u2019s high on our agenda,\u201d Elstone says. \u201cGetting cut-through in the modern world is harder than ever, but we think we can get our players out there with third-party endorsements and commercial deals now that Super League has proper focus. We have to stand together and acknowledge the future of the competition is in our own hands. The game was at a crossroads in this country, and it was time for Super League to take action.

But at last \u201cthe first bars of our overture strike up [and] I feel soothed and ready for anything, grown all of a sudden gay and irresponsible \u2026 From that moment I no longer belong to myself, and all is well.\u201d</p> <p>The shock of <em>The Vagabond</em>, even if one has read it before, is how immediate, funny and fresh it is; how closely observed, compassionate but also unsentimental, especially about the dignity and hurt, illness and poverty hidden behind the gaudy coats of Ren\u00e9e\u2019s fellow cast-members; above all, how fundamentally \u201ctoo soon\u201d it feels, even now, in its supple weighing-up of the choices available to a woman who also happens to be an artist, and the costs of those choices.</p> <p>And one of the many striking things about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/oct/17/featuresreview.review\" title=\"\">Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette</a>, who was born in rural Burgundy in 1873 and died in Paris in 1954, is the sheer number of ways in which she herself existed \u201ctoo soon\u201d. She wrote novels, short stories, essays, memoirs and as a journalist reported on everything from domestic violence to the front lines of the first world war, from anorexia to literature, from fashion and cooking to fake orgasms. She devised silent film scenarios, wrote a libretto for a Ravel opera, and scripted pantomimes \u2013 in which she acted. She was a successful mime and dancer, opened a chain of beauty salons (demonstrating makeovers on her daughter) and was an enthusiastic early adopter of everything from sushi to weightlifting, perms to acupuncture and facelifts. She was for a while the literary editor of le Matin, was married three times, had relationships with women \u2013 and with her second husband\u2019s 16-year-old son.</p> <p>When Proust died, many called her the most talented writer France now had; others claimed she could have taken that crown while he was still alive. She was nominated for the 1948 Nobel prize and although denied a Catholic funeral (for being divorced) was the first French female writer to be given a state funeral. \u201cIn the prize ring of life,\u201d John Updike once noted, \u201cfew of us would have lasted 10 rounds with Colette.\u201d No film could begin to do justice to the range of her experience, so those who have attempted it \u2013 Danny Huston with <em>Becoming Colette</em> (1991), and now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/22/colette-review-keira-knightley-is-on-top-form-in-exhilarating-literary-biopic\" title=\"\">Wash Westmoreland with </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/22/colette-review-keira-knightley-is-on-top-form-in-exhilarating-literary-biopic\" title=\"\">Colette</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/22/colette-review-keira-knightley-is-on-top-form-in-exhilarating-literary-biopic\" title=\"\">, starring Keira Knightley</a> \u2013 wisely do not try, focusing instead on her eventful enough late teens and 20s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5fa310fabfc50a97cd8de3295302f92457c210f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fa310fabfc50a97cd8de3295302f92457c210f5/0_0_4182_3027/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette in Paris, 1935\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Everything after her marriage felt like a kind of fall\u2019 \u2026 Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette in Paris, 1935.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imagno/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Colette finished her first, autobiographical novel, <em>Claudine at School</em>, she was amazed. \u201cI have discovered an astonishing young girl,\u201d she wrote, in a letter to a friend. \u201cDo you know who she is? She is exactly me before my marriage\u201d: a wild country child, at home in fields and woods, musical, mischievous, with braids so long they rested, coiled \u201clike a sleeping python\u201d, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/oct/31/featuresreview.review6\" title=\"\">Colette\u2019s biographer Judith Thurman</a> has it, on the chair beside her. It was not the first time Colette described her adolescent self in tones of elegy and would not be the last.</p> <p>The marriage that ended her teens had not been easy. She was 20, Henry Gauthier-Villars, or Willy, was 34, a saloni\u00e8re and womaniser who in their first year of matrimony laid Colette low with a combination of what sounds like depression (not least because she had discovered him with another woman) and what Thurman suspects was a severe case of gonorrhoea. A literary and theatrical wheeler-dealer, he put his own name to <em>Claudine at School</em>, as he did with the many writers, both male and female, who actually produced the work that made him famous. In <em>The Vagabond</em>, the first novel Colette published under her own name, he becomes a famous painter whose \u201conly genius \u2026 was for lying\u201d.</p> <p>But Colette always also knew that the shock of marriage contained something greater than her own experience of a specific man: it ended any sense of independent sovereignty. And that existential shock, sometimes given to young men, too, reverberates through her fiction \u2013 from the offhand but sincere worry the courtesan L\u00e9a displays for the teenager her self-absorbed lover Ch\u00e9ri is about to marry, in <em>Ch\u00e9ri</em> (1920), to the masterful, quiet short novel \u201cThe Cat\u201d (1933), in which a gentle only boy marries \u201can amorous and untamed young woman\u201d. Marriage, even to someone who is kind and true is, as she puts it in <em>The Vagabond</em>, a \u201clong drawn-out voluptuousness, suspended, fanned, renewed, the winged fall, the swooning in which one\u2019s strength is renewed by its own death\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It was  a world in which lesbianism was effectively accepted \u2013 there was a thriving underground network of lesbian bars and restaurants, codes and gestures</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Claudine at School</em> was followed by <em>Claudine and Annie</em>, <em>Claudine in Paris</em> and <em>Claudine Married</em>. These early autofictions were instant bestsellers: \u201cin purely commercial terms,\u201d as the French scholar Claude Pichois put it, their success \u201cis one of the greatest, if not the greatest in all French literature\u201d. (A famous story, which originated with Colette and is reproduced in the new film, is that Willy locked her in a room in their country house for four hours a day to increase productivity. Thurman, alive to Colette\u2019s self-mythologising, is unconvinced: their city home did not function like that, and in the country Colette, unable to concentrate, seems to have asked her husband to imprison her.) By the last volume, <em>Claudine Married</em>, Colette was reporting on a menage a trois almost in real time, with the protagonists so lightly disguised that the other woman, the American wife of a wealthy French mining engineer, had the novel pulped. But Willy, wily as ever, had retained copyright, and it was rushed out regardless.</p> <p>The fin de si\u00e8cle world in which Colette came of age was one where performance reigned: in the music halls; in the grand salons, where, especially if you were an outsider like the provincial Colette, you were expected to perform an exaggerated version of yourself \u2013 which, if not a great foundation for happiness, was at least very good training for a writer. It was also a world in which lesbianism was effectively accepted \u2013 there was a thriving underground network of lesbian bars and restaurants, codes and gestures, and for six years at the end of her marriage Colette\u2019s lover was a cross-dressing noblewoman, the Marquise de Belbeuf, nicknamed Missy, with whom, for one night, she performed at the Moulin Rouge: their kiss incited a near-riot. Westmoreland\u2019s <em>Colette</em> suggests Willy had little objection to their relationship because it did not threaten him as adultery with a man would have done. More interesting is to see it from the women\u2019s point of view: intimacy on an equal footing; freedom of the mind, and from entrapping children. (Though Colette did not, when she eventually conceived a daughter with her second husband, Henry de Jouvenel, let that get in the way: Colette de Jouvenel, also called Bel-Gazou, often did not see her mother for six months at a time.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"344a87e3e19d49af573a4393ba2012c099ce26ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/344a87e3e19d49af573a4393ba2012c099ce26ef/0_0_1807_1792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colette in 1949.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"992\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colette in 1949 \u2026 during the occupation of France she had written for the collaborationist press.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet Colette found organised feminism profoundly irritating. \u201cYou know what the suffragettes deserve?\u201d she demanded once. \u201cThe whip and the harem.\u201d She was both a libertine and fitfully conservative.

Once you get past the visceral disgust/fear of the older female body it is full of respect for women who work out how to play the game of sex to their own advantage: L\u00e9a and her friends are epicures \u2013 tough, ambitious, independent businesswomen. Like <em>The Vagabond</em>, it is also clear-eyed about the costs: the challenge of living alone; of filling days with meaning. L\u00e9a, whose currency has been her essentially passive body \u2013 unlike Ren\u00e9e\u2019s dancer and writer \u2013 finds it overwhelmingly difficult, far more so than her proud and polished nonchalance has equipped her to endure. Another great strength of <em>Ch\u00e9ri</em> is its domestic accuracy, especially about the shifting sands between two people alone in a room, the vanity and careless cruelty, the weird dance between love and clarity \u2013 \u201cYou never laugh except unkindly \u2013 at people,\u201d L\u00e9a tells Ch\u00e9ri, \u201cand that makes you ugly\u201d. There is also the way in which people behave, so often counterintuitively and according to urges they did not suspect they possessed.</p> <p>And this, if Colette had a creed, might be where it lies: in an adamant insistence on the irreducibly individual \u2013 just as she, throughout her life, insisted on her own right to be so. <em>Gigi</em> (a luminous 1944 novella and eventually a Broadway play that made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/dec/02/audrey-hepburn-back-scene-big-break-national-portrait-gallery\" title=\"\">Audrey Hepburn</a>, hand-picked by Colette, famous, and a 1958 Hollywood film) is the story of a teenager being raised by her grandmother and great-aunt while her mother does long hours playing lowly parts in the serious theatre. The older women are taking her in hand, imparting the rarefied etiquette of the high society courtesan, not least how to avoid \u201cordinary people, that is to say, useless people\u201d. Gigi prefers playing card games with a friend of a family, a beet sugar baron who drops by to escape the latest tittle-tattle about his eligible bachelorship in the press.

And one of the many striking things about Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette, who was born in rural Burgundy in 1873 and died in Paris in 1954, is the sheer number of ways in which she herself existed \u201ctoo soon\u201d. She wrote novels, short stories, essays, memoirs and as a journalist reported on everything from domestic violence to the front lines of the first world war, from anorexia to literature, from fashion and cooking to fake orgasms.

When Colette finished her first, autobiographical novel, Claudine at School, she was amazed. \u201cI have discovered an astonishing young girl,\u201d she wrote, in a letter to a friend. \u201cDo you know who she is?

Puel would still have expected the XI he sent out to progress but with no midweek game and no other competitions to play for, supporters who made the long trip to south Wales would be forgiven their dark mutterings on the return journey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/06/newport-county-leicester-city-fa-cup-match-report\">after a humbling defeat</a>. Sunday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/06/fulham-oldham-athletic-fa-cup-match-report\">other Premier League fall guys, Fulham</a>, at least have a relegation battle to occupy them until May but seventh-placed Leicester are a long way from sixth and with fine victories over Manchester City and at Chelsea last month have shown what they are capable of at full-strength. The Christmas period leaves players jaded but you don\u2019t get second chances in the FA Cup. <strong>Paul Chronnell</strong></p> <h2>2) Nketiah hits right note despite hat-trick of misses</h2> <p>There should have been two 19-year-olds on the scoresheet for Arsenal at Bloomfield Road as the young players entrusted by Unai Emery<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/05/blackpool-arsenal-fa-cup-match-report\"> impressed against Blackpool</a>. Joe Willock, the England Under-20 midfielder, seized his opportunities with two goals that owed much to sharp reactions and good awareness, and was only denied a first Arsenal hat-trick by a correct offside decision. Eddie Nketiah, was nowhere near as clinical, missing three presentable chances before half-time, and yet this remained a promising display from the Lewisham-born forward. Nketiah\u2019s pace, movement and first touch all stood out against the League One side. As did his refusal to allow the misses to effect his contribution. He was replaced by Alexandre Lacazette in the 64th minute, a reminder of the obstacles in the way. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3) Huddersfield must spend to reduce striking deficit</h2> <p>David Wagner was chuckling before the reporter had finished asking a question that started with the words: \u201cLuckily you\u2019re in a January transfer window so you can bring players into the club \u2026\u201d The Huddersfield manager, bringing a touch of reality to it all, replied: \u201cTheoretically this is correct. Everybody knows the circumstances which we have in our football club, that we financially are not at the top of the hierarchy.\u201d His team are bottom of the Premier League and eight points from safety. The German added: \u201cWe will see what we can make happen or not make happen.\u201d A chastening <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/05/bristol-city-huddersfield-fa-cup-match-report\">FA Cup exit at Bristol City</a> made it nine successive defeats and there have been only two victories all season, suggesting the board needs to make as much as possible happen in this window to give Wagner a fighting chance, with a proven goalscorer surely the priority. <strong>Stuart James</strong></p> <h2>4) Ayew buys himself time but Hodgson\u2019s impatience is clear</h2> <p>If Roy Hodgson\u2019s mood was anything to go by after his side <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/05/crystal-palace-grimsby-fa-cup-match-report\">edged past a valiant 10-man Grimsby</a>, thanks to Jordan Ayew\u2019s second goal in as many games, then this could be a long month for the Crystal Palace manager. Having pulled out of a loan deal to sign Dominic Solanke from Liverpool, finding a striker remains imperative given Alexander S\u00f8rloth\u2019s travails in front of goal, although the impending return of Christian Benteke and Ayew\u2019s sudden burst of form may give them some breathing space. The Ghana forward now looks likely to have his loan extended until the end of the season, while Hodgson claimed not to have even heard of Sunderland\u2019s Josh Maja after he was linked with the club last week. \u201cHis name\u2019s not been mentioned to me,\u201d said the former England manager. \u201cI don\u2019t spend my time watching Sunderland play.\u201d <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dfc3251888ad8be408f23c13993653166f7a51b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dfc3251888ad8be408f23c13993653166f7a51b/0_0_3866_2577/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jordan Ayew scores the winner for Palace.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jordan Ayew scores the winner for Palace.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Brooks/Action Plus via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5) F\u00e0bregas\u2019s imminent exit may come back to haunt Sarri</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2019/jan/06/the-dozen-the-weekends-best-fa-cup-photos\">The Dozen: the weekend\u2019s best FA Cup photos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chelsea were busily insisting the deal was not yet done, but the tears of Cesc F\u00e0bregas as he left the Stamford Bridge pitch and the assorted tributes from colleagues suggested otherwise. He played what is almost certain to be his last game for the club <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/05/chelsea-nottingham-forest-fa-cup-match-report\">against Nottingham Forest on Saturday</a> before leaving for Monaco, but even though he has been a peripheral figure you wonder about the wisdom of letting him go mid-season. The Catalan has served as the primary back-up to Jorginho as the deep-lying playmaker, perhaps the most important role in Maurizio Sarri\u2019s system. \u201cIt would be really a problem without Cesc,\u201d said Sarri a few weeks ago, probably because the alternatives are the talented but extremely raw Ethan Ampadu and, erm, David Luiz? The Brazilian centre-back said: \u201cYou need a minimum 20 players to rotate.\u201d <strong>Nick Miller</strong></p> <h2>6) Lampard beginning to sound like an old managerial hand</h2> <p>It felt unusual to hear Frank Lampard behaving like a typical manager on Saturday, offering up \u2013 if not quite excuses \u2013 then mitigation for his side. Derby travel to Leeds this weekend before replaying their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/05/derby-southampton-fa-cup-match-report\">FA Cup tie with Southampton</a> and Lampard wanted it known that his squad will be stretched as his sixth-placed Rams look to hold on to their Championship play-off spot. \u201cWe\u2019re going into a really important phase now, and it\u2019s going to be test after test,\u201d said Lampard. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be competing against tough sides and just behind us are Aston Villa and Stoke with big budgets. I had to give Mason Mount a rest today, but I only have two centre-halves, so they\u2019re playing. I\u2019m not crying, I took this job knowing what it was. Spending the most money doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll win, but I do fear the tiredness and I\u2019m not the only one saying that.\u201d <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> <h2>7) Davies in danger of losing his way at Everton</h2> <p>In an ideal world, Marco Silva would not have introduced Andr\u00e9 Gomes as a half-time substitute on Saturday. The Portugal midfielder has looked tired in recent games and this was a much-needed opportunity for him to rest, but Everton needed to re-establish control <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/05/everton-lincoln-fa-cup-match-report\">against Lincoln City</a> and so on he came. That he replaced Tom Davies was no great surprise given the 20-year-old\u2019s largely ineffective display up to then. It was not the first time either from a boyhood Evertonian who, like Ross Barkley before him, is in danger of losing his way at Goodison Park. Davies, with nine Premier League appearances this season, looked the real deal under Ronald Koeman but, two permanent managers later, the picture is very different and having not grasped the opportunity afforded to him on Saturday it is possible he may not get another one soon. <strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71e9adb22691de4dc659c3aa7169b919387dcfd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71e9adb22691de4dc659c3aa7169b919387dcfd1/0_0_2931_2200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Davies is fouled by Lincoln\u2019s Michael O\u2019Connor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"751\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Davies is fouled by Lincoln\u2019s Michael O\u2019Connor on a day when the young Everton midfielder failed to impress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Impey/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>8) Things about to hot up for Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s United revolution</h2> <p>Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r will enjoy a week of warm-weather training in Dubai with Manchester United feeling his players believe they can now finish in a Champions League berth. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/05/manchester-united-reading-fa-cup-match-report\">Saturday\u2019s 2-0 win over Reading</a> was a fifth consecutive victory as caretaker manager but after closing the gap to six points to Chelsea, fourth place is Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s prime target. \u201cI think the players are getting confidence and the feeling that we have momentum,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "1) Leicester may come to regret resting players in the Cup Given Newport\u2019s recent Cup pedigree \u2013 the League Two side knocked out Leeds and took Tottenham to a replay last season \u2013 Sunday\u2019s game never looked an easy tie for Claude Puel\u2019s Leicester, but looked even less so when he left the likes of Kasper Schmeichel, Harry Maguire, Ben Chilwell, Wilfred Ndidi and Jamie Vardy at home. Puel would still have expected the XI he sent out to progress but with no midweek game and no other competitions to play for, supporters who made the long trip to south Wales would be forgiven their dark mutterings on the return journey after a humbling defeat. Sunday\u2019s other Premier League fall guys, Fulham, at least have a relegation battle to occupy them until May but seventh-placed Leicester are a long way from sixth and with fine victories over Manchester City and at Chelsea last month have shown what they are capable of at full-strength. The Christmas period leaves players jaded but you don\u2019t get second chances in the FA Cup. Paul Chronnell 2) Nketiah hits right note despite hat-trick of misses There should have been two 19-year-olds on the scoresheet for Arsenal at Bloomfield Road as the young players entrusted by Unai Emery impressed against Blackpool. Joe Willock, the England Under-20 midfielder, seized his opportunities with two goals that owed much to sharp reactions and good awareness, and was only denied a first Arsenal hat-trick by a correct offside decision. Eddie Nketiah, was nowhere near as clinical, missing three presentable chances before half-time, and yet this remained a promising display from the Lewisham-born forward. Nketiah\u2019s pace, movement and first touch all stood out against the League One side. As did his refusal to allow the misses to effect his contribution. He was replaced by Alexandre Lacazette in the 64th minute, a reminder of the obstacles in the way. Andy Hunter 3) Huddersfield must spend to reduce striking deficit David Wagner was chuckling before the reporter had finished asking a question that started with the words: \u201cLuckily you\u2019re in a January transfer window so you can bring players into the club \u2026\u201d The Huddersfield manager, bringing a touch of reality to it all, replied: \u201cTheoretically this is correct. Everybody knows the circumstances which we have in our football club, that we financially are not at the top of the hierarchy.\u201d His team are bottom of the Premier League and eight points from safety. The German added: \u201cWe will see what we can make happen or not make happen.\u201d A chastening FA Cup exit at Bristol City made it nine successive defeats and there have been only two victories all season, suggesting the board needs to make as much as possible happen in this window to give Wagner a fighting chance, with a proven goalscorer surely the priority. Stuart James 4) Ayew buys himself time but Hodgson\u2019s impatience is clear If Roy Hodgson\u2019s mood was anything to go by after his side edged past a valiant 10-man Grimsby, thanks to Jordan Ayew\u2019s second goal in as many games, then this could be a long month for the Crystal Palace manager. Having pulled out of a loan deal to sign Dominic Solanke from Liverpool, finding a striker remains imperative given Alexander S\u00f8rloth\u2019s travails in front of goal, although the impending return of Christian Benteke and Ayew\u2019s sudden burst of form may give them some breathing space. The Ghana forward now looks likely to have his loan extended until the end of the season, while Hodgson claimed not to have even heard of Sunderland\u2019s Josh Maja after he was linked with the club last week. \u201cHis name\u2019s not been mentioned to me,\u201d said the former England manager. \u201cI don\u2019t spend my time watching Sunderland play.\u201d Ed Aarons 5) F\u00e0bregas\u2019s imminent exit may come back to haunt Sarri Chelsea were busily insisting the deal was not yet done, but the tears of Cesc F\u00e0bregas as he left the Stamford Bridge pitch and the assorted tributes from colleagues suggested otherwise. He played what is almost certain to be his last game for the club against Nottingham Forest on Saturday before leaving for Monaco, but even though he has been a peripheral figure you wonder about the wisdom of letting him go mid-season. The Catalan has served as the primary back-up to Jorginho as the deep-lying playmaker, perhaps the most important role in Maurizio Sarri\u2019s system. \u201cIt would be really a problem without Cesc,\u201d said Sarri a few weeks ago, probably because the alternatives are the talented but extremely raw Ethan Ampadu and, erm, David Luiz? The Brazilian centre-back said: \u201cYou need a minimum 20 players to rotate.\u201d Nick Miller 6) Lampard beginning to sound like an old managerial hand It felt unusual to hear Frank Lampard behaving like a typical manager on Saturday, offering up \u2013 if not quite excuses \u2013 then mitigation for his side. Derby travel to Leeds this weekend before replaying their FA Cup tie with Southampton and Lampard wanted it known that his squad will be stretched as his sixth-placed Rams look to hold on to their Championship play-off spot. \u201cWe\u2019re going into a really important phase now, and it\u2019s going to be test after test,\u201d said Lampard. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be competing against tough sides and just behind us are Aston Villa and Stoke with big budgets. I had to give Mason Mount a rest today, but I only have two centre-halves, so they\u2019re playing. I\u2019m not crying, I took this job knowing what it was. Spending the most money doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll win, but I do fear the tiredness and I\u2019m not the only one saying that.\u201d Paul MacInnes 7) Davies in danger of losing his way at Everton In an ideal world, Marco Silva would not have introduced Andr\u00e9 Gomes as a half-time substitute on Saturday. The Portugal midfielder has looked tired in recent games and this was a much-needed opportunity for him to rest, but Everton needed to re-establish control against Lincoln City and so on he came. That he replaced Tom Davies was no great surprise given the 20-year-old\u2019s largely ineffective display up to then. It was not the first time either from a boyhood Evertonian who, like Ross Barkley before him, is in danger of losing his way at Goodison Park. Davies, with nine Premier League appearances this season, looked the real deal under Ronald Koeman but, two permanent managers later, the picture is very different and having not grasped the opportunity afforded to him on Saturday it is possible he may not get another one soon. Sachin Nakrani 8) Things about to hot up for Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s United revolution Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r will enjoy a week of warm-weather training in Dubai with Manchester United feeling his players believe they can now finish in a Champions League berth. Saturday\u2019s 2-0 win over Reading was a fifth consecutive victory as caretaker manager but after closing the gap to six points to Chelsea, fourth place is Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s prime target. \u201cI think the players are getting confidence and the feeling that we have momentum,\u201d he said. How United fare in Sunday\u2019s trip to third-placed Tottenham will provide the best barometer yet of where United are. \u201cThey\u2019ve performed really well over a few years now and they\u2019ve been towards the top of the league,\u201d said the Norwegian. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Harry Kane, one of the best strikers in the world, Christian Eriksen, Son Heung-min, Dele Alli \u2013 and we have to look at how we play against them.\u201d Jamie Jackson 9) Unwanted replay adds to the Newcastle tragi-comedy Hats off to Blackburn\u2019s impressive Bradley Dack and Charlie Mulgrew for raising the tone but the reality is that most drama at Newcastle occurs off the pitch these days. Unfortunately it tends to be of the tragi-comic variety. For instance, the weekend saw an orchestrated leaking of a letter from Peter Kenyon to Mike Ashley saying he hopes his consortium will be offered more time to try and buy out Newcastle. Then there\u2019s the separate suggestion the two consortiums headed by Kenyon and Garry Cook might somehow govern the club, coalition style. Maybe Kenyon and Cook could be joint chief executives? Meanwhile Rafael Ben\u00edtez seems under pressure to sign a one-year contract extension \u2013 his current deal expires in May \u2013 in exchange for Ashley buying some new players this month. Ben\u00edtez will not relish next week\u2019s Ewood Park replay. Louise Taylor 10) Best and worst of Carroll leaves West Ham future in balance It was tricky to assess Andy Carroll\u2019s performance in West Ham\u2019s nervy victory. On the one hand it was a typical piece of Carroll play that settled the tie, with the Birmingham defence powerless to stop the big man from rising to score his first goal since last April, and in those moments it is easy to understand why the 30-year-old might yet win over Manuel Pellegrini.

The Golden Globes notoriously gets weak at the knees around big stars (which is presumably why it overlooked the fact that The Kominsky Method is stupid and bad) so for a relative newcomer like Criss to beat the likes of Hugh Grant, Benedict Cumberbatch, Antonio Banderas and Daniel Bruhl is a true achievement.</p>",

We\u2019ll start with the latter, because that\u2019s more fun. If you take the opinion of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association as gospel, which you probably shouldn\u2019t (Bohemian Rhapsody? Really?), the biggest lesson to learn from last night\u2019s awards is that comedy is in the worst trouble of its life. Of the three categories reserved for comedy \u2013 best actor, best actress, best series \u2013 two went to Netflix\u2019s The Kominsky Method and one went to Amazon\u2019s The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. This would be fine if either of these shows were remotely funny or good, but they\u2019re not, so it isn\u2019t. The Kominsky Method is a middling autumnal wist-com shored up by a big-ticket cast, and any given episode of The Marvelous Mrs Maisel is roughly the television equivalent of being beaten to death by a Puppini Sisters CD you found at a car boot fair. What a waste of three perfectly good trophies. Look at the list of nominees and you\u2019ll find shows that are smarter, braver and \u2013 importantly \u2013 actually capable of making you laugh. Barry was in there. Atlanta was in there. The Good Place was in there. GLOW was in there. All of them are more deserving than the actual winners, which are both the sort of show you\u2019d expect to blare out unwatched at full volume in the corner of a residential home common room. Good comedy does actually exist, HFPA. Do better next year. Luckily, the drama category winners were less alarmingly wayward. The Americans probably won best TV series because it\u2019s finished now, and awards shows such as these have a habit of posthumously course-correcting, but it was deserved nevertheless. Maybe now the series is as critically acclaimed as it always deserved to be, people will actually start watching it. Probably not. Patricia Clarkson\u2019s win for Sharp Objects was also undeniable. Her character was one of last year\u2019s biggest TV monsters, and she played it so chillingly that she\u2019s single-handedly preventing me from ever rewatching the series. And it was great that Golden Globes co-host Sandra Oh won for her funny and complicated role on Killing Eve, even if she did spaff away a perfectly good acceptance speech at the end of the her opening monologue. Ben Whishaw winning for A Very English Scandal was thoroughly deserved, since a lesser actor would have steered his character into a one-note comic territory. Richard Madden winning for Bodyguard, though, was a little weird. Compared to, say, Matthew Rhys in The Americans, he tended to come across as a little flat. If he\u2019s named as the next James Bond, it\u2019ll be because of this. And so to The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story. Hopes weren\u2019t exactly high for this gem of a series before the ceremony; not only was it written off as a dud compared to The People v OJ Simpson, but it faced some titanic competition in the form of Sharp Objects, A Very English Scandal and \u2013 in the acting category \u2013 Benedict Cumberbatch. The fact that it won twice, for best limited series and best actor, feels a little like vindication for those of us who fell for it from the start. It wasn\u2019t a perfect show \u2013 the fact that Edgar Ramirez and Penelope Cruz were both nominated for their respective fling-it-at-a-wall-and-see-what-sticks accents remains bewildering \u2013 but it was gripping and livid and Darren Criss\u2019 central performance was nothing short of mesmerising. The Golden Globes notoriously gets weak at the knees around big stars (which is presumably why it overlooked the fact that The Kominsky Method is stupid and bad) so for a relative newcomer like Criss to beat the likes of Hugh Grant, Benedict Cumberbatch, Antonio Banderas and Daniel Bruhl is a true achievement.",

It worked brilliantly for Rhapsody, but not for Star. Could it be the curse of the early frontrunner? Practically from the moment the lights went down at its premiere, A Star Is Born was hailed as the film to beat; Bohemian Rhapsody, on the other hand, was considered a joke, a bit of poppy fluff that no one expected much from.

In the event, their gentle and lightly surreal turn went down well with the audience and \u2013 crucially \u2013 the opinion-formers on Twitter. One of the undoubted highlights was a deeply felt speech from Oh \u2013 the first person of Asian descent to host the Globes \u2013 who celebrated what she called \u201ca moment of change\u201d in Hollywood.

Scarcely a year goes by without the TV super-producer taking home a prize (for Glee, American Horror Story, The People v OJ Simpson and many others), or in the case of this year, two (The Assassination of Gianni Versace took best actor as well as miniseries). The scary thing is that Murphy might only just be getting started \u2013 he\u2019s signed a multimillion dollar deal with Netflix, who themselves are proving to be grandmasters at hoovering up Globes.

But it\u2019s now a two-horse race, with Olivia Colman nabbing the lion\u2019s share of pre-Globe awards, then capping her best actress in a comedy or musical win with a lovely, predictably endearing speech, some of which was redacted from the official broadcast, thanking, among others, \u201cme bitches\u201d Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz. The latter\u2019s cheery wave from the table was also a ceremony highlight. When a star is born, another one fades A Star Is Born and Bohemian Rhapsody both went down the I\u2019m Not a Musical route despite \u2013 basically \u2013 being musicals. Partly down to industry sniffiness (hey, we\u2019re doing something important here!) and partly down to cunning awards-season strategy (when was the last time a blatantly uplifting movie won the Oscars?), the repositioning had mixed results. It worked brilliantly for Rhapsody, but not for Star. Could it be the curse of the early frontrunner? Practically from the moment the lights went down at its premiere, A Star Is Born was hailed as the film to beat; Bohemian Rhapsody, on the other hand, was considered a joke, a bit of poppy fluff that no one expected much from. Now the boot is firmly on the other foot. A Star Is Born is fading fast (best song is the least it could have expected) while Bohemian Rhapsody is well on its way. All hail Sandra Oh Eyebrows were quizzically raised when Killing Eve star Oh and Brooklyn Nine-nine\u2019s Andy Samberg were announced as hosts of this year\u2019s ceremony \u2013 the pair had no history of appearing together, bar a brief segment at last year\u2019s Emmys and, some argued, lacked the required star wattage to handle such a prominent gig. In the event, their gentle and lightly surreal turn went down well with the audience and \u2013 crucially \u2013 the opinion-formers on Twitter. One of the undoubted highlights was a deeply felt speech from Oh \u2013 the first person of Asian descent to host the Globes \u2013 who celebrated what she called \u201ca moment of change\u201d in Hollywood. Oh managed to break further ground later in the ceremony when she became the first woman of Asian descent to win multiple globes with her best actress in a TV drama prize for Killing Eve. Not a bad night\u2019s work, all told. Donald Trump was another big winner Two years ago, Meryl Streep brought the house down with her broadside at the freshly-elected president. This year, the T-word went unuttered. The closest the ceremony came to politics was Christian Bale thanking \u201cSatan\u201d for his inspiration when portraying former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney in Vice, and this speech from Brad Simpson, director of American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, reflecting on how was show was \u2013 or was not \u2013 a period piece: Those forces of hate and fear are still with us. They tell us that we should be scared of people who are different from us. They tell us we should put walls around ourselves. As artists we must fight back by representing those who are not represented and by providing a space for new voices to tell stories that haven\u2019t been told. As human beings, we should resist in the streets, resist at the ballot box and practice love and empathy in our everyday lives. But Ryan Murphy himself was bigger To paraphrase Gary Lineker \u2013 the Golden Globes is a simple awards ceremony. Everyone dresses up and in the end Ryan Murphy wins. Scarcely a year goes by without the TV super-producer taking home a prize (for Glee, American Horror Story, The People v OJ Simpson and many others), or in the case of this year, two (The Assassination of Gianni Versace took best actor as well as miniseries). The scary thing is that Murphy might only just be getting started \u2013 he\u2019s signed a multimillion dollar deal with Netflix, who themselves are proving to be grandmasters at hoovering up Globes. Be afraid, everyone else working in TV. Be very afraid.",

Rahaf Mohammed Mutlaq al-Qunun, 18, claims she was abducted on Sunday and had her passport confiscated by Saudi Arabian diplomatic staff on arrival at Bangkok\u2019s Suvarnabhumi airport. Qunun has barricaded herself in her hotel room in fear that Thai immigration officials, who have congregated outside her hotel room door, would force her on to a plane to leave the country. On Monday a friend, who had taken over Qunun\u2019s Twitter account at her request, said officials from Kuwait Airways had come to her door but she refused to leave. A flight scheduled for 11.15am, local time, departed without her. Thai lawyers had filed an injunction with the Bangkok criminal court to prevent her deportation, Phil Robertson, Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia deputy director, said late on Monday. The Guardian has confirmed Qunun had a three-month multiple-entry tourist visa for Australia, where she said she was intending to seek asylum, apparently contradicting reported statements by Thai authorities that she did not have the required documents to travel to Australia from Bangkok.

But a last-minute marketing campaign planted seeds of doubt with a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2AsIXSh2xo\">trailer</a> that left many calling it an ill-timed, sense-swapped copy of A Quiet Place, released to critical and commercial success earlier in the year.</p> \n<p>While the John Krasinski/Emily Blunt thriller focused on monsters who used sound to hunt their victims, in Bird Box, a demonic force targets sight. For those unlucky enough to catch a glimpse, their greatest fears become realised. Netflix remained confident, despite bad buzz, and nabbed a slot at the AFI film festival alongside awards-friendly titles such as Roma and Green Book. They also targeted voters with a sneak peek Directors Guild of America screening in New York. Both promising signs of a prestige project.</p> \n<p>Then critics caught a glimpse and, well, fear was far from realised.</p> \n<p>\u201cA wannabe shocker \u2026 shortchanged in terms of suspense, scares and thrills,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/bird-box-review-1160672\">said</a> the Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Todd McCarthy. \u201cThese characters feel so crammed together and underwritten that they add up to almost nothing,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/14/bird-box-review-sandra-bullock-netflix-susanne-bier\">wrote</a> the Guardian\u2019s Amy Nicholson. \u201cA toy-chest apocalypse in which the rules of the game are, to all appearances, never understood,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/bird-box-reviewed-an-apocalypse-built-for-netflix\">complained</a> the New Yorker\u2019s Richard Brody.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2AsIXSh2xo\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/o2AsIXSh2xo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The reviews weren\u2019t quite as toxic as those that met Netflix\u2019s last big Christmas bet, the Will Smith-starring fantasy Bright, but they immediately put a stop to any awards chatter and pegged Bird Box as yet another misjudged original gamble. In a way, it seemed like the natural conclusion to a year that saw them spew out The Cloverfield Paradox, Mute, Extinction and TAU, all malformed attempts to prove they can take on the multiplex with genre film-making.</p> \n<p>Unlike those films however, Netflix granted Bird Box a campaign that rivaled the scale of its cinema-dwelling counterparts. Cities were strewn with billboards and digital ads, Bullock and director Susanne Bier (hot off award-winning miniseries The Night Manager) made their way around the interview circuit and the film was even given a one-week exclusive engagement on the big screen.</p> \n<p>While it has become notoriously hard to judge the success of a Netflix drop, given how the platform refuses to release viewership figures, it was clear that within days, Bird Box was an unqualified phenomenon. Not only did it start trending on Twitter but it soon became an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/03/netflix-bird-box-challenge-meme-sandra-bullock-blindfold\">unlikely meme-magnet</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NikeIsMyLogo23/status/1077478360614354944\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"Could you see us being together\" <br><br>Me: <a href=\"https://t.co/VbadnRdJWv\">pic.twitter.com/VbadnRdJWv</a></p>\u2014 VON TOO WAVY\ud83d\ude0e (@NikeIsMyLogo23) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NikeIsMyLogo23/status/1077478360614354944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 25, 2018</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/katiewalter02/status/1077396252466315264\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">me after watching birdbox <a href=\"https://t.co/DsuLUcyzzc\">pic.twitter.com/DsuLUcyzzc</a></p>\u2014 katie walter (@katiewalter02) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/katiewalter02/status/1077396252466315264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 25, 2018</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SMIII25/status/1078806501345632258\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The blind when everyone was committing suicide in bird box <a href=\"https://t.co/FoRBhs4MtZ\">pic.twitter.com/FoRBhs4MtZ</a></p>\u2014 SamManning (@SMIII25) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SMIII25/status/1078806501345632258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 29, 2018</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>The reaction was so ebullient that it led Netflix to temporarily remove a different blindfold by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NetflixFilm/status/1078735051406204928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">tweet-bragging</a> that over 45 million accounts had watched Bird Box in its first seven days, the biggest first week for one of their original films to date. While the release of an actual number (45,037,125, to be exact) might be somewhat groundbreaking given their reluctance to do so in the past, it follows on from a number of equally confident, if intentionally vaguer, statements about other 2018 releases.</p> \n<p>In October\u2019s third-quarter earnings report, Netflix <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/netflix-rom-coms-80-million-1202981966/\">beamed</a> over the results of their \u201cSummer of Love\u201d \u2013 a group of in-house romantic comedies that left most critics cold yet left subscribers fully engaged with over 80 million watching at least one of them and To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before singled out as a particular hit. In December, Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/netflixs-christmas-chronicles-kurt-russells-biggest-movie-ted-sarandos-2018-12\">claimed</a> that their festive adventure The Christmas Chronicles had the \u201cmost impact\u201d of any of star Kurt Russell\u2019s films to date with 20 million watching in the first week.</p> \n<p>The Bird Box brag has left some industry figures unsure over the number\u2019s veracity. Firstly, it\u2019s not a figure that\u2019s been independently assessed unlike, say, Nielsen ratings or official box office results. Secondly, while Netflix has stated that a user watching at least 70% of a film counts as a view, it is unclear how many of the 45m streams were complete.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a huge fan and proponent of Netflix, but to believe that nearly one-third of all of their subscribers not only watched 70% of the movie but did so in the first week of it being on the site is all but unfathomable,\u201d an anonymous producer told <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-bird-box-sparks-debate-over-data-in-hollywood-2018-12\">Business Insider</a> over the weekend. \u201cI want to believe it but just can\u2019t. It\u2019s not a watch for the faint of heart, after all.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7371748d-135c-45fd-adad-a83831bae667\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/361kslpyQMU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But regardless of the potentially troublesome nature of this number, the film\u2019s immediacy of impact is undeniable. In less than a month, Bird Box has already become part of the public lexicon in a way that would have been infinitely harder to achieve with a cinema-only release, provoking more chatter than last month\u2019s big screen hits combined. The film\u2019s viewership is so large that Kim Kardashian\u2019s tweet asking if anyone had yet seen it, just 10 days after release, was <a href=\"https://www.bet.com/celebrities/news/2019/01/02/kim-kardashian-discovered-bird-box-twitter.html\">the subject of widespread ridicule</a>. Fans have even <a href=\"https://abc7.com/entertainment/bird-box-fans-flocking-to-monrovia-home/5012604/\">turned the house featured in the film into a tourist attraction</a>, showing up in droves to take blindfolded selfies.</p> \n<p>Reactions reached a new fever pitch with the \u201cBird Box challenge\u201d which has seen fans blindfolding themselves before taking on various tasks from petting dogs to playing basketball to, most worryingly, driving. It all led to the official Netflix account tweeting: \u201cCan\u2019t believe I have to say this, but: PLEASE DO NOT HURT YOURSELVES WITH THIS BIRD BOX CHALLENGE.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a very careful consideration about how it translates,\u201d director Bier <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bird-box-director-how-netflix-film-defies-metrics-success-1172846\">said</a> to the Hollywood Reporter of the film\u2019s wildfire reaction. \u201cClassical measurement has either been box office or awards. This defies all of it. But creating a phenomenon is bound to translate into something.\u201d</p> \n<p>So what is it about Bird Box that\u2019s led to such unprecedented success?</p> \n<p>Based on a novel by Josh Malerman, the rights to Bird Box were originally purchased by Universal in 2013 before it was even published. Mama director Andy Muschietti, who would go on to direct It, was attached and Arrival\u2019s Eric Heisserer was onboard to adapt. But the project fell apart and the script was then included in 2014\u2019s Black List, an annual roundup of the best unproduced screenplays knocking around Hollywood. Fast forward to 2017 and after one of the project\u2019s original producers joined Netflix, the film was suddenly brought to life.</p> \n<p>It was reportedly made for less than $20m, a far more modest investment than some of the platform\u2019s more high-profile titles (Bright cost $90m while Outlaw King was made for a reported $120m), and given the consistency of the horror genre at the box office, the film would have undoubtedly made a tidy profit on the big screen. But as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheBoxOfficeGuy/status/1078873986396610560\">one analyst pointed out on Twitter</a>, if those 45 million subscribers all bought a ticket to see it in the first week, it would have made roughly $411m in seven days, over $20m more than what The Force Awakens achieved in the same period.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f94f2afc52ef51003138944eea954be1e1dd94ae\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f94f2afc52ef51003138944eea954be1e1dd94ae/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trevante Rhodes and Sandra Bullock in Bird Box.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trevante Rhodes and Sandra Bullock in Bird Box.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Merrick Morton/Netflix</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But that\u2019s really the inarguable key to why Bird Box hit so hard because no matter what the release date, it\u2019s close to impossible imagining that such a large amount of people would have gone out and purchased tickets to see it. Netflix hasn\u2019t released figures for Bird Box\u2019s exclusive big screen engagement for the week before its streaming release, a likely sign that the numbers weren\u2019t quite so impressive.</p> \n<p>As a consumer, the in-home premiere of a film with a snappy high-concept and an appealing A-list lead would seem like an early Christmas gift, requiring no greater commitment than pressing play. Bullock is a notoriously picky actor, even more so after her Oscar win for The Blind Side in 2013 and her cannily chosen projects since have mostly proved just how wide her appeal remains. In 2013, she scored two major hits with Gravity and The Heat and while 2015\u2019s Our Brand is Crisis was an Oscarbait misstep, her lead role in last year\u2019s Ocean\u2019s 8 was a resounding success, at least commercially, with almost $300m in the bank.</p> \n<p>While some pundits have <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2018/12/29/bird-box-netflix-sandra-bullock-trevante-rhodes/#681f703f7e28\">suggested</a> the film\u2019s success is a direct result of her star appeal, it\u2019s worth sharing the wealth with her ensemble, an almost algorithmically constructed cast of easy-to-place faces, picked with considerable skill.

The company\u2019s awareness of the value of their viewing statistics to help figure out what future projects are worth betting on suggests that Bird Box will have an indelible effect on what\u2019s in store and the algorithmic assembly of the film suggests that such strategising is what led to its existence in the first place.</p> \n<p>Bird Box landed in the same month as Roma, the critically adored drama from Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n that\u2019s predicted to land Netflix its first best picture nomination and perhaps even a win.

It\u2019s an impressive slate for any studio and while the established big-hitters, from Disney to Warners, have been doggedly keeping their blindfolds on since Netflix entered the fray, unwilling to view a streaming platform as a serious challenger, 2019 might see them reluctantly taking them off to face the terrifying truth that lies ahead.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There was a sense of dread surrounding Netflix\u2019s release of survival horror Bird Box, and not just because of the terrifying premise. The film, led by Sandra Bullock, was seen as one of the platform\u2019s splashier original offerings of 2018 with a juicy set-up, an in-demand director and a high-profile pre-Christmas release. But a last-minute marketing campaign planted seeds of doubt with a trailer that left many calling it an ill-timed, sense-swapped copy of A Quiet Place, released to critical and commercial success earlier in the year. While the John Krasinski/Emily Blunt thriller focused on monsters who used sound to hunt their victims, in Bird Box, a demonic force targets sight. For those unlucky enough to catch a glimpse, their greatest fears become realised. Netflix remained confident, despite bad buzz, and nabbed a slot at the AFI film festival alongside awards-friendly titles such as Roma and Green Book. They also targeted voters with a sneak peek Directors Guild of America screening in New York. Both promising signs of a prestige project. Then critics caught a glimpse and, well, fear was far from realised. \u201cA wannabe shocker \u2026 shortchanged in terms of suspense, scares and thrills,\u201d said the Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Todd McCarthy. \u201cThese characters feel so crammed together and underwritten that they add up to almost nothing,\u201d wrote the Guardian\u2019s Amy Nicholson. \u201cA toy-chest apocalypse in which the rules of the game are, to all appearances, never understood,\u201d complained the New Yorker\u2019s Richard Brody. The reviews weren\u2019t quite as toxic as those that met Netflix\u2019s last big Christmas bet, the Will Smith-starring fantasy Bright, but they immediately put a stop to any awards chatter and pegged Bird Box as yet another misjudged original gamble. In a way, it seemed like the natural conclusion to a year that saw them spew out The Cloverfield Paradox, Mute, Extinction and TAU, all malformed attempts to prove they can take on the multiplex with genre film-making. Unlike those films however, Netflix granted Bird Box a campaign that rivaled the scale of its cinema-dwelling counterparts. Cities were strewn with billboards and digital ads, Bullock and director Susanne Bier (hot off award-winning miniseries The Night Manager) made their way around the interview circuit and the film was even given a one-week exclusive engagement on the big screen. While it has become notoriously hard to judge the success of a Netflix drop, given how the platform refuses to release viewership figures, it was clear that within days, Bird Box was an unqualified phenomenon. Not only did it start trending on Twitter but it soon became an unlikely meme-magnet. The reaction was so ebullient that it led Netflix to temporarily remove a different blindfold by tweet-bragging that over 45 million accounts had watched Bird Box in its first seven days, the biggest first week for one of their original films to date. While the release of an actual number (45,037,125, to be exact) might be somewhat groundbreaking given their reluctance to do so in the past, it follows on from a number of equally confident, if intentionally vaguer, statements about other 2018 releases. In October\u2019s third-quarter earnings report, Netflix beamed over the results of their \u201cSummer of Love\u201d \u2013 a group of in-house romantic comedies that left most critics cold yet left subscribers fully engaged with over 80 million watching at least one of them and To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before singled out as a particular hit. In December, Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos claimed that their festive adventure The Christmas Chronicles had the \u201cmost impact\u201d of any of star Kurt Russell\u2019s films to date with 20 million watching in the first week. The Bird Box brag has left some industry figures unsure over the number\u2019s veracity. Firstly, it\u2019s not a figure that\u2019s been independently assessed unlike, say, Nielsen ratings or official box office results. Secondly, while Netflix has stated that a user watching at least 70% of a film counts as a view, it is unclear how many of the 45m streams were complete. \u201cI\u2019m a huge fan and proponent of Netflix, but to believe that nearly one-third of all of their subscribers not only watched 70% of the movie but did so in the first week of it being on the site is all but unfathomable,\u201d an anonymous producer told Business Insider over the weekend. \u201cI want to believe it but just can\u2019t. It\u2019s not a watch for the faint of heart, after all.\u201d But regardless of the potentially troublesome nature of this number, the film\u2019s immediacy of impact is undeniable. In less than a month, Bird Box has already become part of the public lexicon in a way that would have been infinitely harder to achieve with a cinema-only release, provoking more chatter than last month\u2019s big screen hits combined. The film\u2019s viewership is so large that Kim Kardashian\u2019s tweet asking if anyone had yet seen it, just 10 days after release, was the subject of widespread ridicule. Fans have even turned the house featured in the film into a tourist attraction, showing up in droves to take blindfolded selfies. Reactions reached a new fever pitch with the \u201cBird Box challenge\u201d which has seen fans blindfolding themselves before taking on various tasks from petting dogs to playing basketball to, most worryingly, driving. It all led to the official Netflix account tweeting: \u201cCan\u2019t believe I have to say this, but: PLEASE DO NOT HURT YOURSELVES WITH THIS BIRD BOX CHALLENGE.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a very careful consideration about how it translates,\u201d director Bier said to the Hollywood Reporter of the film\u2019s wildfire reaction. \u201cClassical measurement has either been box office or awards. This defies all of it. But creating a phenomenon is bound to translate into something.\u201d So what is it about Bird Box that\u2019s led to such unprecedented success? Based on a novel by Josh Malerman, the rights to Bird Box were originally purchased by Universal in 2013 before it was even published. Mama director Andy Muschietti, who would go on to direct It, was attached and Arrival\u2019s Eric Heisserer was onboard to adapt.

All UK forces were ordered three years ago to ensure their laboratories met international standards for analysing prints found at crime scenes. But only three forces have complied, with almost every force missing a deadline set by the regulator to gain accreditation by November. Police forces that have failed to obtain accreditation, which include the Metropolitan police and Greater Manchester police, will have to declare this in court, prompting concerns that cases could collapse as a result of unreliable evidence. Gillian Tully, the government\u2019s forensic regulator, said: \u201cThe shortcomings identified do not mean that all fingerprint evidence is of poor quality, but they do highlight risks to the quality of evidence. \u201cThe risks are greatest in situations where the comparison is complex, for example because the fingermark is partial or distorted.\u201d The National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council lead for forensics, Ch Const James Vaughan, said: \u201cWe are treating delays in in gaining accreditation as a critical incident, with a chief officer overseeing forces\u2019 progress and assisting them in gaining accreditation as soon as possible.\u201d The failures are the latest problems to have affected forensics in the past year. Alleged data tampering at Randox Laboratories in Manchester led to dozens of criminal convictions being overturned and required thousands of samples to be reanalysed. Problems in digital forensics caused the collapse of a number of rape trials and police were criticised for outsourcing digital work to unaccredited private labs that are subject to no regulatory oversight. In a recent submission to a House of Lords inquiry, the Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science raised broader concerns about the way fingerprints, tool marks, footwear, tyre marks and ballistics evidence were being used in courts. Prof Niamh Nic Da\u00e9id, the centre\u2019s director, said: \u201cThe majority, if not all of those techniques, are not robustly researched. In a lot of cases, the comparative process is left to the subjective opinion of the person doing the comparison. It often could be described as no better than spot the difference.\u201d She said more rigorous research was needed on error rates associated with this type of evidence. In her submission to the same inquiry, Tully said there had been a resistance in fingerprint evidence to move away from the traditional approach of an expert declaring an identification towards a more transparent, scientific approach, with objective measures and an acknowledgement of the possibility of false matches. Vaughan said forces that had failed to meet official standards had been asked to consider outsourcing work to existing accredited labs, and that they would be open in providing declarations to court if analysis was carried out at unaccredited facilities. \u201cIt is then for the court to test the veracity and admissibility of the evidence and, to date, no concerns raised have been raised by courts,\u201d he said.",

The timetable will vary, but there will probably be a session on marine pollution and what you can and cannot put down your toilet, followed by shelter building, sand art, and lunch (in your shelter), then rock pools, a beach clean, and finally stories and roasted marshmallows around a seaside camp fire.</p> <p>Welcome to beach school. After the success of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/apr/21/outdoor-learning-forest-school-revolution\">forest school </a>movement, which has encouraged teachers to take tens of thousands of school children out of the confines of the classroom to learn outdoors in a natural environment, there is a new push to teach on the beach.</p> <p>It may not be as accessible for inland schools, but for children growing up within easy reach of the coast, there are growing opportunities to learn by the seaside. As well as studying the impact of plastic pollution and the beauty of coastal flora and fauna, the children also learn about tidal forecasts, lunar cycles, ecology and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/geomorphology\">geomorphology</a>.

      "bodyText": "On Bovisand beach near Plymouth, the school day begins with morning assembly and a briefing about sea safety. The timetable will vary, but there will probably be a session on marine pollution and what you can and cannot put down your toilet, followed by shelter building, sand art, and lunch (in your shelter), then rock pools, a beach clean, and finally stories and roasted marshmallows around a seaside camp fire. Welcome to beach school. After the success of the forest school movement, which has encouraged teachers to take tens of thousands of school children out of the confines of the classroom to learn outdoors in a natural environment, there is a new push to teach on the beach. It may not be as accessible for inland schools, but for children growing up within easy reach of the coast, there are growing opportunities to learn by the seaside. As well as studying the impact of plastic pollution and the beauty of coastal flora and fauna, the children also learn about tidal forecasts, lunar cycles, ecology and geomorphology. They get fresh air, physical exercise, make friends and learn about teamwork. Ali Murray works for Beach Schools South West, a small community-based company dedicated to outdoor learning. \u201cWe work with schools to take the curriculum to the beach.

Malek was a popular choice: he is a tremendous actor and he is widely liked as one of the nicest guys in the business. The same thing can\u2019t be said for the film\u2019s credited director Bryan Singer (who left the film and was replaced by Dexter Fletcher midway through the shoot). Singer was icily uninvited and unmentioned in this ceremony, something between a Voldemort not to be named and a Banquo\u2019s ghost. Social media erupted in rage that at a time when the industry is supposed to have learned from #MeToo there are any reminders at all of the very impenitent Singer.</p> \n<p>However, Bohemian Rhapsody is the feelgood, feelnostalgic, feelexalted tribute to Freddie Mercury and his rise to stardom fronting Queen in the 1970s, culminating in their spectacular performance at Live Aid in 1985, an event which reasserted their popularity and which this movie contrives to suggest was a climactic moment for Mercury personally: a kind of lifetime achievement award, the supposed crux of a reconciliation with his parents, and a coming-to-terms with his being a person with HIV. Malek is absolutely terrific in this film: his performance has enormous energy and charm and he gives Mercury a breezy lovability in his offstage life. Arguably, the movie insists on a hetero-vanilla flavour which means that his existence as a gay man \u2013 whose identity is camouflaged by the glam rock aesthetic of the age \u2013 is a bit diluted. But there is, it seems to me, no dishonesty in the screenplay. It\u2019s great to see the moment when Freddie hands over an EP copy of his masterpiece to Kenny Everett. (Kenny Everett! Where is the biopic of Kenny Everett actually? Maybe Dickie Beau can develop his cameo here for a full-length film!) And it\u2019s also nice to see Mike Myers as glowering EMI boss Ray Foster (based on real-life Roy Featherstone). which takes us all back to Wayne\u2019s World, with Wayne and his buddies rocking out to Bohemian Rhapsody in their car.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5afe8316698ad534eeebe3b42a81243e6a51db10\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5afe8316698ad534eeebe3b42a81243e6a51db10/0_45_1837_1102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Glenn Close wins for The Wife.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Glenn Close wins for The Wife.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But for me Malek\u2019s performance is a bigger achievement than the balsawood-constructed film itself \u2013 although the film is admittedly a great showcase for it. And for this likeable, but rather negligible movie to have beaten out If Beale Street Could Talk and A Star Is Born feels very wrong. It also feels disconcerting for Bohemian Rhapsody to have crowded out Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Roma, which as a non-English-language film was not eligible for the award \u2013 although Cuar\u00f3n was duly rewarded in the director category, ahead of Spike Lee, Adam McKay, Peter Farrelly and Bradley Cooper.

This they do with the help of the Green Book, a guide to hotels and restaurants where African-Americans could stay and eat with no (or at least a minimum of) racist harassment.

This would have exacerbated poor water quality for already stressed fish.</p> \n<p>At the time of the first incident WaterNSW and the NSW Department of Primary Industry blamed the drought.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe ongoing drought conditions across western New South Wales have resulted in fish kills,\u201d they said in a joint statement.</p> \n<p>The DPI\u2019s director of aquatic environment, Sarah Fairfull, said the prolonged dry period resulted in poor water quality along much of the Darling River and in other valleys.</p> \n<p>WaterNSW said at the time it was continuing to monitor water quality throughout the dams and river systems.</p> \n<p>The latest incident will again raise questions about the NSW government\u2019s stewardship of the Murray-Darling River system, which has been under intense scrutiny since the ABC Four Corners program aired allegations of water theft by irrigators and a close relationship between senior bureaucrats and major water users.</p> \n<p>Since the 1960s, the original Menindee Lakes have been significantly altered to serve as a major storage for water for the Murray-Darling Basin as well as the water supply for Broken Hill. The lakes are also a major fish breeding area for native fish, and critical to maintaining stocks of fish throughout the river system.</p> \n<p>However, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/11/the-menindee-lakes-project-who-loses-and-who-really-wins\">NSW government has proposed shrinking the lakes</a> and altering the way it manages the water storage, in order to reduce evaporation. It is currently building a $500m pipeline from the Murray to Broken Hill in order to provide the inland city with an alternative water supply.</p> \n<p>But the plan is highly controversial because it will mean the government has less reason to keep the lakes full and will likely see the Lower Darling run dry more often.</p> \n<p>Local graziers and the towns of Wilcannia and Pooncarie are up in arms about the state of the river, accusing the NSW government of sacrificing their 500km stretch of the Darling in order to benefit upstream cotton growers.</p> \n<p>They say the current crisis is due to Water NSW\u2019s decision to run the lakes dry despite forecasts of drought.</p> \n<p>Local grazier Julie McClure said there was virtually no water flowing under the bridge at Tilpa where she lives.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne neighbour is drawing water for stock and homestead use from a green stagnant pool.

There should be some rules around emergency water management.\u201d</p> \n<p>The new plan for Menindee Lakes is currently before the Murray Darling Basin Authority as part of a suite of projects that the states are proposing as an alternative to buying water for the environment from farmers. The idea is that the projects will deliver equivalent environmental outcomes.

Residents near the Menindee Lakes are reporting what is the second major fish kill along a 20km stretch of water near Weir 32. An incident before Christmas saw an estimated 10,000 fish die. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Locals have been posting photos of dying fish washed up along the shores of the lakes which are about 100km east of Broken Hill. And local fish experts are saying that it could all but wipe out the populations of Murray cod and other native fish, raising serious questions about the way WaterNSW is managing the lakes system. Two years ago the lakes were almost full. But WaterNSW has been releasing water and allowing extraction upstream for irrigation at a rate that has left the lakes almost completely dry. According to the WaterNSW website, there is just 2.5% of water remaining in the lakes. Rod McKenzie, a fishing journalist and angler, who runs tours of the Murray-Darling, said he feared the kill would spell the end of a once great fishery. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute tragedy. This is a world-scale fish kill, but the catastrophe has been so well orchestrated and there is so much money involved you won\u2019t get to the bottom of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it were native animals like koalas and platypuses and they were lying by the side of the road, people would be up in arms,\u201d he said. Just before Christmas about 10,000 fish were estimated to have died in mass death incident in a 40km stretch a little further upstream. Investigations by the Department of Primary Industries confirmed that Murray cod, golden and silver perch and bony bream had died in that event. DPI said it had visited the Menindee Lakes on Monday and \u201cconfirmed had been a major fish kill event in the Darling river at Menindee affecting hundreds of thousands of fish, including golden perch, Murray cod, and Bony Herring\u201d. DPI senior fisheries manager, Anthony Townsend, said the department would use the incident to learn more about our native fish and improve management. He said the incident seemed to have resulted from a sudden drop in temperature which may have disrupted an existing algal bloom, killing it and leading to a depletion of dissolved oxygen in the river water. This would have exacerbated poor water quality for already stressed fish. At the time of the first incident WaterNSW and the NSW Department of Primary Industry blamed the drought. \u201cThe ongoing drought conditions across western New South Wales have resulted in fish kills,\u201d they said in a joint statement. The DPI\u2019s director of aquatic environment, Sarah Fairfull, said the prolonged dry period resulted in poor water quality along much of the Darling River and in other valleys. WaterNSW said at the time it was continuing to monitor water quality throughout the dams and river systems. The latest incident will again raise questions about the NSW government\u2019s stewardship of the Murray-Darling River system, which has been under intense scrutiny since the ABC Four Corners program aired allegations of water theft by irrigators and a close relationship between senior bureaucrats and major water users. Since the 1960s, the original Menindee Lakes have been significantly altered to serve as a major storage for water for the Murray-Darling Basin as well as the water supply for Broken Hill. The lakes are also a major fish breeding area for native fish, and critical to maintaining stocks of fish throughout the river system. However, the NSW government has proposed shrinking the lakes and altering the way it manages the water storage, in order to reduce evaporation. It is currently building a $500m pipeline from the Murray to Broken Hill in order to provide the inland city with an alternative water supply. But the plan is highly controversial because it will mean the government has less reason to keep the lakes full and will likely see the Lower Darling run dry more often. Local graziers and the towns of Wilcannia and Pooncarie are up in arms about the state of the river, accusing the NSW government of sacrificing their 500km stretch of the Darling in order to benefit upstream cotton growers. They say the current crisis is due to Water NSW\u2019s decision to run the lakes dry despite forecasts of drought. Local grazier Julie McClure said there was virtually no water flowing under the bridge at Tilpa where she lives. \u201cOne neighbour is drawing water for stock and homestead use from a green stagnant pool. When she showers, she takes a bucket of rainwater to rinse off after using the river water,\u201d she said. \u201cIt smells like a fish market. There should be some rules around emergency water management.\u201d The new plan for Menindee Lakes is currently before the Murray Darling Basin Authority as part of a suite of projects that the states are proposing as an alternative to buying water for the environment from farmers. The idea is that the projects will deliver equivalent environmental outcomes. The Menindee Lakes project has received a very poor assessment by the authority\u2019s experts. Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick said: \u201cThe Darling River is going into cardiac arrest and both the federal and NSW governments are asleep at the wheel of the ambulance.\u201d He called on the federal government to step in and ensure that water from recent rain in Queensland was used to deal with the environmental emergency occurring in northern NSW and the Lower Darling. \u201cWith less than 250ML per day flowing over Weir 32 there must be no water flowing from the Darling River into the Murray. The Darling River, a river that is crucial for river flow through the Murray mouth and into the Coorong, is dying and the government is simply not acting.\u201d \u201cThe government cannot ignore what is going on. The river is stagnant, the government can\u2019t be\u201d.",

In the 1950s, in the pre-revolution era of King Faisal II, and then again during the oil boom of the 1980s, the city vied to regain its historical place as the centre of the Arab world.

      "bodyText": "After an exhausting journey through Baghdad\u2019s vast and grimy suburbs, the pastel-coloured blocks of Besmaya Dream City rise up above the rushes just beyond one of the modern gates marking the edge of the city. The orderliness of these dozens of towers \u2013 some lived in, some unfinished \u2013 is a shock in the otherwise chaotic jumble of low-rise cityscape. The residential complex is being built by a South Korean company, Hanwha, and there are ambitious plans to build homes for up to 600,000 residents once its delayed construction is complete. Once through the security checkpoint, you find children at play in the quiet public areas between the blocks. Families sit and chat on plastic chairs outside a newly opened tea stall. Dream City \u2013 aimed at the beleaguered middle class \u2013 offers one potential vision of the future as the population of Iraq\u2019s capital nears 10 million and the city prepares to join the ranks of the world\u2019s megacities. Baghdad is in flux. Violence has dominated here for much of the past 15 years, from the US-led invasion of 2003 and subsequent occupation to the years of sectarian bloodshed. That declined until a new resurgence of violence as Islamic State claimed territory in towns such as Fallujah and Ramadi, just a short drive away. The dismantling of Isis\u2019s self-proclaimed caliphate has prompted a renewed intake of breath. Bombs occasionally explode and tensions remain, but Baghdad feels more normal these days, vibrant even \u2013 despite the omnipresent \u201cmartyr pictures\u201d of police, army and militia members who died fighting the group. Baghdadis have long relied on Zawra amusement park for entertainment The Zawra amusement park, long a focus of Baghdad weekends, is crowded with picnicking families, and wealthier areas such as Jadriya and Karrada are buzzing. On the streets, dandified young men in tailored jackets and drainpipe trousers sport towering pompadour hairstyles. Ground has been broken for a new Central Bank building designed by the late Zaha Hadid, although as with many new projects, when it will completed is an open question. Residents flock to the towering new Baghdad Mall with its shops and restaurants, marble floors and planters. But Baghdad remains a profoundly damaged place. And for all its newness, Dream City echoes many of the city\u2019s continuing issues. The Mohamed family in their Dream City apartment In her sixth-floor apartment, Baidaa Mohamed, a mother of two, is enthusiastic about many aspects of her new home, which she bought with a cheap mortgage after moving from the centre of the city. With its own power station, Dream City has more regular electricity than most of Baghdad, which still suffers regular power cuts. Her new flat is quiet, modern and pleasant, the floor scattered with toys and with room for her son to run around. \u201cHere, there\u2019s nonstop electricity and piped gas which means I don\u2019t have to worry about heavy cooking gas tanks, and continuous tap water,\u201d she says. \u201cBut what\u2019s most important is that the children are safe. I have a kindergarten just across from us and it\u2019s free because it\u2019s public.\u201d Mohamed remains worried, though, not least by the impending transfer of management of her block from the South Koreans who built it to an Iraqi company. 15 years of conflict have unstitched Baghdad Frankenstein in Baghdad, the recent novel by Ahmed Saadawi, contains a metaphor for the current state of the city. Like Saadawi\u2019s reanimated monster Whatsitsname \u2013 built from the body parts of victims of sectarian bombs \u2013 Baghdad has cannibalised itself to keep going. Larger dwellings have been divided and subdivided by families to deal with the growing housing crisis, largely illegally. Squatter neighbourhoods have taken over old army bases from the Saddam Hussein era, even the old nuclear centre in Diyala. Districts once designed as utopian low-income housing projects have been built over. The reality is that 15 years of conflict have unstitched Baghdad. Sitting like a cuckoo on the banks of the Tigris is the international zone, known as the Green Zone when it was occupied by the invading American forces. It is still a secure area separate from the rest of Baghdad. Guardian photographer Sean Smith has worked in Baghdad a number of times over the past 15 years, capturing key moments in the city\u2019s history Throughout the city, concrete security walls surround buildings and whole districts. Put in place by US forces to lessen the sectarian bloodshed, they remain like Whatsitsname\u2019s rough sutures, punctuated by military and police checkpoints. All of which has accelerated a process long under way, which sees the old Baghdad, with its yellow-brick houses and ornate wooden mashrabiya balconies, fast becoming a distant memory. Baghdad\u2019s recent population growth has been driven by conflict as well as other more familiar issues, as people have moved from the peripheral cities most affected by the recent violence. Baghdad was not always like this A drive around the city with Abdelwehab Alwehab (pictured above), a professor of urban planning at the university, underlines Baghdad\u2019s problems. In one of the nicer neighbourhoods he stops to show us where eight new dwellings have been illegally squeezed on to the site of a demolished house. Such practices are a persistent and growing problem in the city. A little further on he points out a street appropriated and gated off by a government minister for his own use. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he says, \u201cthe last 15 years have really transformed Iraqi cities and Iraqi society, not least in terms of ethics and corruption. \u201cWhatever the high hopes after the 2003 invasion, they did not materialise. Take transport. The approach to transport infrastructure here is basically nothing but patching up problems.\u201d As if to illustrate the point, we are sitting in one of Baghdad\u2019s interminable and inevitable traffic jams. The city lacks a mass transit system, and most travel involves long, fitful journeys by private car or minibus taxi. \u201cBaghdad\u2019s urban integrity was fragmented,\u201d he says. \u201cThe city was divided into safe and unsafe neighbourhoods, [separated] physically behind high concrete walls. These neighbourhoods became cities within the city.\u201d One visible result has been the mushrooming growth of Baghdad\u2019s outsize malls. Inside, people shop and eat safe from the threat of car bombs. In a city where summer temperatures reach the high 40s, the air-conditioning is popular too. Baghdad street food Baghdad was not always like this. In the 1950s, in the pre-revolution era of King Faisal II, and then again during the oil boom of the 1980s, the city vied to regain its historical place as the centre of the Arab world. It attracted leading international architects and planners including Walter Gropius, Frank Lloyd Wright, Gio Ponti and Le Corbusier. Some projects were built, such as Le Corbusier\u2019s gymnasium and Ponti\u2019s Ministry of Planning, but others remained incomplete or never left the drawing board. A series of impressive masterplans to guide Baghdad\u2019s development were also produced, most of which foundered on the exigencies of Iraq\u2019s decades of crises, from revolution in the 1950s, through the Iran-Iraq conflict and the early 90s Gulf war, to international sanctions on the regime of Saddam Hussein and the renewed violence of the last decade and a half. A first British masterplan in the 1950s was superseded in the 1960s by a Polish communist vision, drawn up by Miastoprojekt and Polservice and inspired by the Soviet-era experience of European reconstruction. Another new vision, drawn up by a Japanese consortium, followed in the 1980s.

If state intervention \u2013 under both King Faisal and Saddam Hussein \u2013 once defined Baghdad\u2019s rapid development, these days, argues Alwehab, it is notable in its absence. Instead, privatised interests encroach on all areas of the urban environment, not least in the city\u2019s chronic housing crisis.

It will explain how the NHS will spend the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/06/may-gives-no-guarantee-nhs-waiting-times-despite-extra-20bn\">extra funding May announced last year</a> to mark its 70th birthday, which will increase its budget in England from \u00a3115bn to \u00a3135bn by 2023-24.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/06/the-nhs-10-year-plan-what-we-already-know\">The NHS 10-year plan: what we already know</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But experts and doctors\u2019 leaders warned that May and Stevens\u2019s vision risked being undermined and reduced to a set of \u201cgroundless aspirations\u201d because of the NHS\u2019s deepening staffing crisis, continued cuts to public health and limits to what the extra investment could achieve. Turning the plan into reality will be \u201cextremely tough\u201d, one leading health expert said.</p> <p>Stevens said that as the service looked ahead to its 80th anniversary, the document \u201ckeeps all that\u2019s good about our health service and its place in our national life. It tackles head-on the pressures our staff face. And it sets a practical, costed, phased route map for the NHS\u2019s priorities for care quality and outcomes improvement for the decade ahead.\u201d</p> <p>Ministers and NHS England have already disclosed that the plan will involve a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/05/mental-health-care-waiting-time-targets-10-year-nhs-plan\">massive expansion in the help available to people with mental health problems</a>, as well as major improvements in other key areas such as maternity services and care provided in or near people\u2019s homes.</p> <p>On Sunday night, Stevens outlined how the transformation of care would also see every child who is diagnosed with cancer given a genomic test, patients offered digital consultations with a GP and a huge drive to ramp up the early detection and treatment of diseases in order to reduce avoidable loss of life.</p> <p>If implemented these plans will lead to up to 500,000 more lives being saved over the next decade, through 85,000 fewer premature deaths a year, Stevens said. For example, from April the NHS will ensure that 85% of all those who suffer from heart failure take part in a \u201chealthy living\u201d programme involving exercise and better diet. Prevention of illness will also become a key priority as a way of reducing the pressures on the service.</p> <p>Genetic testing will be deployed to identify people with high cholesterol. People who have had a stroke because of a blood clot in their brain will undergo a procedure called mechanical thrombectomy, which has been shown to greatly increase their chances of avoiding becoming disabled. And there will be big moves to make it easier for people to be tested for cancer as part of an attempt to improve Britain\u2019s poor record on early diagnosis of the disease.</p> <p>However, the emergence of key details of the plan prompted senior figures in health to caution that NHS England may not be able to deliver everything proposed.</p> <p>Dr Jennifer Dixon, the chief executive of the Health Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cThis is a pragmatic plan with an ambitious vision to improve NHS care, but making it a reality will be extremely tough given growing pressures on services, widespread staff shortages and continued cuts to other parts of the health and care system.\u201d</p> <p>She highlighted the growing NHS-wide shortage of nurses, doctors and almost every other type of health professional as a particular danger. \u201cThe NHS is already short of 100,000 doctors, nurses and other staff. While there are initiatives in the plan to build the workforce, they need to be matched with action from central government to secure training budgets and a supportive migration policy to allow international recruitment that is vital to staffing the NHS.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/02/is-the-nhs-the-worlds-best-healthcare-system\">Is the NHS the world's best healthcare system?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nigel Edwards, the chief executive of the Nuffield Trust health thinktank, said that improvements in care may come to a halt because the extra funding \u201cis enough to move forwards, but with little room for manoeuvre.

      "bodyText": "NHS leaders are to outline a future in which genomics, cutting-edge surgery and artificial intelligence help save hundreds of thousands more lives and every area of care is improved in return for the government\u2019s major funding boost for the service. On Monday, Theresa May and Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, will publish the service\u2019s long-awaited long-term plan, which will pledge to transform the help it provides everyone from premature babies to the growing number of older people over the next 10 years. The document will set out detailed plans to dramatically reduce the number of people dying from big killers such as cancer, heart attacks and strokes. It will explain how the NHS will spend the extra funding May announced last year to mark its 70th birthday, which will increase its budget in England from \u00a3115bn to \u00a3135bn by 2023-24. But experts and doctors\u2019 leaders warned that May and Stevens\u2019s vision risked being undermined and reduced to a set of \u201cgroundless aspirations\u201d because of the NHS\u2019s deepening staffing crisis, continued cuts to public health and limits to what the extra investment could achieve. Turning the plan into reality will be \u201cextremely tough\u201d, one leading health expert said. Stevens said that as the service looked ahead to its 80th anniversary, the document \u201ckeeps all that\u2019s good about our health service and its place in our national life. It tackles head-on the pressures our staff face. And it sets a practical, costed, phased route map for the NHS\u2019s priorities for care quality and outcomes improvement for the decade ahead.\u201d Ministers and NHS England have already disclosed that the plan will involve a massive expansion in the help available to people with mental health problems, as well as major improvements in other key areas such as maternity services and care provided in or near people\u2019s homes. On Sunday night, Stevens outlined how the transformation of care would also see every child who is diagnosed with cancer given a genomic test, patients offered digital consultations with a GP and a huge drive to ramp up the early detection and treatment of diseases in order to reduce avoidable loss of life. If implemented these plans will lead to up to 500,000 more lives being saved over the next decade, through 85,000 fewer premature deaths a year, Stevens said. For example, from April the NHS will ensure that 85% of all those who suffer from heart failure take part in a \u201chealthy living\u201d programme involving exercise and better diet. Prevention of illness will also become a key priority as a way of reducing the pressures on the service. Genetic testing will be deployed to identify people with high cholesterol. People who have had a stroke because of a blood clot in their brain will undergo a procedure called mechanical thrombectomy, which has been shown to greatly increase their chances of avoiding becoming disabled. And there will be big moves to make it easier for people to be tested for cancer as part of an attempt to improve Britain\u2019s poor record on early diagnosis of the disease. However, the emergence of key details of the plan prompted senior figures in health to caution that NHS England may not be able to deliver everything proposed. Dr Jennifer Dixon, the chief executive of the Health Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cThis is a pragmatic plan with an ambitious vision to improve NHS care, but making it a reality will be extremely tough given growing pressures on services, widespread staff shortages and continued cuts to other parts of the health and care system.\u201d She highlighted the growing NHS-wide shortage of nurses, doctors and almost every other type of health professional as a particular danger. \u201cThe NHS is already short of 100,000 doctors, nurses and other staff. While there are initiatives in the plan to build the workforce, they need to be matched with action from central government to secure training budgets and a supportive migration policy to allow international recruitment that is vital to staffing the NHS.\u201d Nigel Edwards, the chief executive of the Nuffield Trust health thinktank, said that improvements in care may come to a halt because the extra funding \u201cis enough to move forwards, but with little room for manoeuvre. If we face a no-deal Brexit, the extra costs and tasks required would eat up the first instalments, stopping progress dead in its tracks. And if social care and public health continue to be starved of funding, a stretched NHS will have even less to spare.\u201d Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chair of the British Medical Association, said the plan needed to include clear proposals to enable hospitals to resume meeting key waiting times in A&amp;E and cancer care and planned operations, which are being \u201cspectacularly missed\u201d. Among ministers and NHS leaders, \u201cthere is a need for honesty about how far the \u00a320.5bn over five years will stretch. This is well below the 4% uplift that independent experts have calculated is required, and below historic spending levels since inception of the NHS. It would be disingenuous to suggest this money will in itself wipe out the daily pressures patients are experiencing in the NHS,\u201d Nagpaul added.",

But obviously you cannot compare the two of them,\u201d says Kontar, 37. \u201cWhistler is an amazing place. There is nothing but nature, fresh air, wonderful people and beautiful snow.\u201d</p> <p>Kontar was working in Dubai when war broke out in Syria in 2011. Knowing he would be forced to fight if he went back home, Kontar stayed in the UAE after his passport and work visa both expired, and was eventually deported to Malaysia. After being refused entry to Cambodia, Ecuador, Malaysia and Turkey, Kontar \u2013 a pacifist and minority Druze from Sweida province \u2013 found himself stranded in the arrivals section of Kuala Lumpur airport, a transit zone without restaurants or shops. For eight months, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/26/hassan-al-kontar-syrian-refugee-stranded-airport-asylum-canada-vancouver\">he slept under stairwells, showered in a disabled toilet and ate donated airline meals</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"38e330c376cb45bc353c5f3dee9ec59b91682eb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38e330c376cb45bc353c5f3dee9ec59b91682eb4/0_0_2048_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hassan al-Kontar in Kuala Lumpur airport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hassan al-Kontar in Kuala Lumpur airport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Hassan al-Kontar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He feels lucky to have been granted asylum \u2013 a status achieved with the help of a few Canadians he calls his \u201cavenger team\u201d, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/26/hassan-al-kontar-syrian-refugee-stranded-airport-asylum-canada-vancouver\">sponsored him privately</a> for resettlement. Yet he always carries the weight of knowing that though he has made it to safety, many others have not.\u201cThe guilt. The guilt is always there,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI am still receiving hate comments, and that is very hard. \u2026 But the hate is strong, especially from Malaysia and the Arab world, even from Syria \u2013 they always find something to criticise. For some I betrayed my country, for others I\u2019m a coward who ran away from his duties.\u201d</p> <p>He fights the negativity by trying to find solutions. He lobbies on behalf of detainees in Manus Island, Australia\u2019s offshore detention centre, speaks in Canadian schools about his experience and is using his story to push wider knowledge about what is happening back at home in Syria. But he also recognises his own limitations.</p> <p>\u201cThe more I learn [about how to help], the more confused I get. What can I do? I am limited in my power,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I need to be positive, for me and my family, and for other refugees. We learn from our mistakes and we find strength in ourselves. I try to tell everyone there\u2019s a hero inside each of us \u2026 you need to believe in what you are doing.\u201d</p> <p>Kontar is now living with one of own his real-life heroes, Laurie Cooper, a media relations consultant from Whistler who, along with some friends, organised Kontar\u2019s resettlement. Kontar even got his own version of a Hollywood ending to a story that has drawn multiple comparisons to Steven Spielberg\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/aug/01/features.review\">The Terminal</a>: his asylum papers came through just in time for Christmas.</p> <p>He lives in a log cabin on the edge of the woods with Cooper, her family and their pets, and is treated as a minor celebrity whenever they go into town. \u201cHe\u2019s been very warmly welcomed by the community here,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cWe cannot walk around the village without people coming up to say hello, give him a hug, welcome him to Whistler, buy him a coffee or give him a high five.\u201d</p> <p>Kontar believes it is people like Cooper, who has helped with more than 30 refugee resettlements to Canada, who will turn things around in a world increasingly hostile to migrants and refugees. \u201cWhen it comes to organisations, or the United Nations, or global systems, they have failed us \u2013 not only us as Syrians but the Yemeni, Iraqi, Rohingya, everyone who needs help,\u201d Kontar says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to focus on the normal people who enjoy their normal lives from their normal living rooms. They can make a difference if they decide to: all we have to do is educate them, enlighten them about what is happening, and show them how they can help.\u201d</p> <p>Kontar points to his own story: despite his many international interviews from Kuala Lumpur airport, only one refugee lawyer volunteered to help with his case; in the end, it was the only one he needed. \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone who\u2019s willing to help anyone anywhere, please try to volunteer, try to help, try to do something,\u201d he urges. \u201cPeople read these stories [about migrants] and feel sad and then hesitate, but it\u2019s not that difficult. You can do it.

      "bodyText": "Hassan al-Kontar has been living in Canada for just under a month. But the Syrian refugee \u2013 who made global headlines after becoming stranded in a Malaysian airport for more than eight months in 2018 \u2013 is so busy with media requests that he jokes he has only managed to get out into the snow a handful of times. \u201cIt\u2019s very much like living in the airport, all the interviews. But obviously you cannot compare the two of them,\u201d says Kontar, 37. \u201cWhistler is an amazing place. There is nothing but nature, fresh air, wonderful people and beautiful snow.\u201d Kontar was working in Dubai when war broke out in Syria in 2011. Knowing he would be forced to fight if he went back home, Kontar stayed in the UAE after his passport and work visa both expired, and was eventually deported to Malaysia. After being refused entry to Cambodia, Ecuador, Malaysia and Turkey, Kontar \u2013 a pacifist and minority Druze from Sweida province \u2013 found himself stranded in the arrivals section of Kuala Lumpur airport, a transit zone without restaurants or shops. For eight months, he slept under stairwells, showered in a disabled toilet and ate donated airline meals. He feels lucky to have been granted asylum \u2013 a status achieved with the help of a few Canadians he calls his \u201cavenger team\u201d, who sponsored him privately for resettlement. Yet he always carries the weight of knowing that though he has made it to safety, many others have not.\u201cThe guilt. The guilt is always there,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI am still receiving hate comments, and that is very hard. \u2026 But the hate is strong, especially from Malaysia and the Arab world, even from Syria \u2013 they always find something to criticise. For some I betrayed my country, for others I\u2019m a coward who ran away from his duties.\u201d He fights the negativity by trying to find solutions. He lobbies on behalf of detainees in Manus Island, Australia\u2019s offshore detention centre, speaks in Canadian schools about his experience and is using his story to push wider knowledge about what is happening back at home in Syria. But he also recognises his own limitations. \u201cThe more I learn [about how to help], the more confused I get. What can I do? I am limited in my power,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I need to be positive, for me and my family, and for other refugees. We learn from our mistakes and we find strength in ourselves. I try to tell everyone there\u2019s a hero inside each of us \u2026 you need to believe in what you are doing.\u201d Kontar is now living with one of own his real-life heroes, Laurie Cooper, a media relations consultant from Whistler who, along with some friends, organised Kontar\u2019s resettlement. Kontar even got his own version of a Hollywood ending to a story that has drawn multiple comparisons to Steven Spielberg\u2019s The Terminal: his asylum papers came through just in time for Christmas. He lives in a log cabin on the edge of the woods with Cooper, her family and their pets, and is treated as a minor celebrity whenever they go into town. \u201cHe\u2019s been very warmly welcomed by the community here,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cWe cannot walk around the village without people coming up to say hello, give him a hug, welcome him to Whistler, buy him a coffee or give him a high five.\u201d Kontar believes it is people like Cooper, who has helped with more than 30 refugee resettlements to Canada, who will turn things around in a world increasingly hostile to migrants and refugees. \u201cWhen it comes to organisations, or the United Nations, or global systems, they have failed us \u2013 not only us as Syrians but the Yemeni, Iraqi, Rohingya, everyone who needs help,\u201d Kontar says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to focus on the normal people who enjoy their normal lives from their normal living rooms. They can make a difference if they decide to: all we have to do is educate them, enlighten them about what is happening, and show them how they can help.\u201d Kontar points to his own story: despite his many international interviews from Kuala Lumpur airport, only one refugee lawyer volunteered to help with his case; in the end, it was the only one he needed. \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone who\u2019s willing to help anyone anywhere, please try to volunteer, try to help, try to do something,\u201d he urges. \u201cPeople read these stories [about migrants] and feel sad and then hesitate, but it\u2019s not that difficult. You can do it. You can help.\u201d Kontar has not seen his family for a decade. He watched from afar as friends and family in Syria married and had children. War broke out. His father died. His city came under attack from Isis. And all the while, he was thinking, \u201cI am not there,\u201d he says. \u201cI could not be there. That is a sadness that makes you feel it will never leave you, it will break you or leave you damaged. I feel now like I\u2019m running out of time, like I need to make them happy, like I want them to taste what I\u2019m tasting right now.\u201d The hope is that one day, maybe they will join him in Canada. But for the moment, Kontar is happy to have been adopted into the Cooper family \u2013 and the Coopers are glad to have him. \u201cWe\u2019d been in almost daily contact for seven months before he was detained and I felt I really knew him, even though we\u2019d never met,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cWhen I finally gave him a hug, it felt like my son had come home.\u201d \u201cYou can feel the love in this house,\u201d agrees Kontar. \u201cEveryone is very supportive and they are all wonderful people. So I feel 100% like I am at home.\u201d",

Born in London in 1999, he migrated to Germany when he was three and moved back to London in 2015. When it was clear the UK had voted to leave the European Union, Buxton, now 19, was shocked. \u201cI never thought of myself as anything other than European,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like a large chunk of my identity was being stripped away from me.\u201d</p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/06/brexit-may-warns-opponents-they-risk-damaging-uk-economy-and-democracy\">Brexit less than three months away</a> and the debate showing no sign of abating, the futures of young people like Buxton have become central to the discussions \u2013 even if they aren\u2019t always consulted about it. In his local constituency of Poplar and Limehouse, he is one of many who feel their voices are not being heard.</p> <p>The east London borough \u2013 which includes a booming financial sector, a large student population from the nearby university, and just over half of its residents from a minority ethnic background \u2013 voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU. But the local Labour MP, Jim Fitzpatrick, who campaigned against Brexit, has said he will respect the result of the referendum. It\u2019s a decision that has angered and dismayed some of his younger constituents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/poplar-zip/giv-3902vtZIdB1txeFW/\" data-alt=\"Constituency map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/poplar-zip/giv-3902vtZIdB1txeFW/\">Constituency map</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cPoplar and Limehouse voted to remain in the EU. As an MP, Jim Fitzpatrick\u2019s immediate concern should be listening to the wishes of his constituents,\u201d said Buxton, adding that his area had far too much to lose from leaving the trading bloc. He joined the Liberal Democrats soon after the referendum and describes them as \u201cthe only party fighting for an exit from Brexit\u201d.</p> <p>The European Medicines Agency and European Banking, both currently based in Canary Wharf at the heart of the constituency, are relocating to other European cities. A recent study by Sussex University on the economic impact of Brexit noted that Poplar and Limehouse would be the <a href=\"http://blogs.sussex.ac.uk/uktpo/files/2018/12/Note-on-constituencies.pdf\">third most affected constituency</a> in terms of potential job losses caused by a no-deal Brexit. It is estimated the area could lose 7,950 jobs.</p> <p>\u201cIt provides me with a challenge and a contradiction and some great difficulty. But as I said to all my constituents, either leave or remain, it wasn\u2019t a Poplar or Limehouse referendum, but it was a national referendum and the national vote is we\u2019re leaving the EU,\u201d said Fitzpatrick.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/21/elders-older-wiser-brexit-clown-parliament-generation-politics\">Our elders are supposed to be older and wiser.

      "bodyText": "Dominic Buxton didn\u2019t much care for politics when he was at school but in June 2016 he stayed up to watch the results of the Brexit referendum. Born in London in 1999, he migrated to Germany when he was three and moved back to London in 2015. When it was clear the UK had voted to leave the European Union, Buxton, now 19, was shocked. \u201cI never thought of myself as anything other than European,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like a large chunk of my identity was being stripped away from me.\u201d With Brexit less than three months away and the debate showing no sign of abating, the futures of young people like Buxton have become central to the discussions \u2013 even if they aren\u2019t always consulted about it. In his local constituency of Poplar and Limehouse, he is one of many who feel their voices are not being heard. The east London borough \u2013 which includes a booming financial sector, a large student population from the nearby university, and just over half of its residents from a minority ethnic background \u2013 voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU. But the local Labour MP, Jim Fitzpatrick, who campaigned against Brexit, has said he will respect the result of the referendum. It\u2019s a decision that has angered and dismayed some of his younger constituents. \u201cPoplar and Limehouse voted to remain in the EU. As an MP, Jim Fitzpatrick\u2019s immediate concern should be listening to the wishes of his constituents,\u201d said Buxton, adding that his area had far too much to lose from leaving the trading bloc. He joined the Liberal Democrats soon after the referendum and describes them as \u201cthe only party fighting for an exit from Brexit\u201d. The European Medicines Agency and European Banking, both currently based in Canary Wharf at the heart of the constituency, are relocating to other European cities. A recent study by Sussex University on the economic impact of Brexit noted that Poplar and Limehouse would be the third most affected constituency in terms of potential job losses caused by a no-deal Brexit. It is estimated the area could lose 7,950 jobs. \u201cIt provides me with a challenge and a contradiction and some great difficulty. But as I said to all my constituents, either leave or remain, it wasn\u2019t a Poplar or Limehouse referendum, but it was a national referendum and the national vote is we\u2019re leaving the EU,\u201d said Fitzpatrick. Fitzpatrick said he was inclined to vote against Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement and cited Labour\u2019s current policy on Brexit: vote down May\u2019s deal, push for a general election, and try to renegotiate a new deal. Other options \u2013 including a second referendum \u2013 remain firmly on the table. Fitzpatrick said he was listening carefully to the concerns of his constituents, adding: \u201cI have to square the circle between the national decision to leave, the national interest, party politics, constituency interests and my own conscience.\u201d Fitzpatrick is also under pressure from young Labour voters to keep the country in the EU. \u201cI would say with every Labour MP who wants to push ahead with Brexit, the country did not vote for a Tory Brexit.

After the speech, Anning said he was unaware of the historical use of the term, but his refusal to stop talking about banning \u201cnon-European migration\u201d eventually proved too much for the Katter party, which expelled him a few months later. The independent MP Kerryn Phelps was among MPs who came out most strongly on Sunday against Anning\u2019s decision to attend Saturday\u2019s \u201cdemonstration by a neo-Nazi group\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it has any place in Australian society,\u201d Phelps told the ABC on Sunday. \u201cWe have a harmonious, multicultural community and I think Australians want to keep it that way and these kinds of demonstrations are not what I would like to be seeing in Australia.\u201d The state Liberal member for Caulfield, David Southwick, who is Jewish, condemned the Melbourne rally, saying Australians needed to speak out against the \u201cappalling behaviour\u201d displayed by racists at the event. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said there was no excuse for Anning\u2019s attendance at the rally, and his view had no place in the federal parliament. The Business Council of Australia also strongly condemned the \u201cracist demonstrations\u201d. In a statement on Monday, it reminded voters of the importance of Australia\u2019s non-discriminatory immigration program. \u201cMigrants are valued members across the entire community, including in the business sector, where they are some of our most distinguished leaders,\u201d the statement said. \u201cSuccessive waves of immigration have helped build Australia, making it more tolerant, more prosperous and a stronger country. \u201cDespite the actions of a small group of extremists over the weekend, Australians overwhelmingly support the fair and non-discriminatory immigration program that has benefited this country for decades.\u201d",

But when Ray Taylor, 56, had his benefits cut for 13 weeks after illness meant he missed an appointment to sign on, he had no option but to get out his walking shoes. He doesn\u2019t have friends with cars to give him a lift, and with no money coming in, he couldn\u2019t pay the \u00a37 bus fare from the small Cambridgeshire town of Ramsey to Huntingdon, where he is registered for benefits. And if he missed signing on again, he would be sanctioned again.</p> <p>Taylor, a former electrician \u2013 he couldn\u2019t afford to update his qualifications after being made redundant and going freelance \u2013 is remarkably stoical about what could be a weekly trek. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a 9 o\u2019clock appointment, you have to set off in the early hours to make sure you get there,\u201d he says. There have been \u201cquite a few times\u201d he has set off at two in the morning to avoid penalties for lateness. (\u201cSanctions\u201d can involve benefits being reduced \u2013 or stopped entirely.) </p> <p>A pre-dawn start in the pitch-black of rural Cambridgeshire with cars and farm lorries rumbling along pavement-less roads doesn\u2019t sound all that safe. Taylor, who survived being homeless in Cambridge for seven years before being housed in Ramsey, smiles as his eyes stream from the cold. \u201cThere\u2019ve been a few moments.\u201d The police have picked him up a couple of times and taken him home to ensure his safety, he recalls.</p> <p>Come the end of March, other Ramsey residents may have to embark on this trudge that is nearly the length of a marathon. That is because the No 30 bus that is the sole public transport link between Ramsey and Huntingdon is due to be cut. The only alternative for anyone without a car will be to beg lifts from friends or family, cycle or find the \u00a340 round-trip taxi fare. It is an impossible sum for anyone on a low income, and even most working people couldn\u2019t find it five days a week.</p> <p>To experience the route Taylor has walked \u201coh, maybe 20 or 30 times\u201d, we meet at the more civilised hour of 8am by the decorative wrought-iron bus shelter next to Ramsey\u2019s clocktower. The night before, driving across Cambridgeshire, gusts of wind hurling rain across my windscreen, I begin to dread the walk to come. Morning, however, has dawned bright but chilly. Hoiking our rucksacks on our backs, we pull our hats down and head south out of town. We are accompanied by Steve Corney, the town council\u2019s new mayor, and Jane Sills, the chair of the Ramsey Million Big Local residents group, which has campaigned for the past 18 months against the cutting of the No 30 bus.</p> <p>\u201cFor the people here, the bus means everything,\u201d says Corney over the noise of traffic streaming out of Ramsey. There are no big employers in the town, so there is a daily exodus. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because when you see it, there\u2019s a lot of people on it.\u201d Corney notes too that housing development means Ramsey\u2019s population of 8,000 is expanding.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e5661c1d72e9d566d7a53546f6752a3be9c74e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e5661c1d72e9d566d7a53546f6752a3be9c74e8/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Huntington to Ramsey bus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Huntington to Ramsey bus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We pick up the pace as we reach the edge of town, where Corney peels off. As we march past a long-abandoned RAF station, it is the isolation suffered by older people and teenagers in cut-off rural areas that is on Jane Sills\u2019 mind. James Palmer, the mayor of the new Cambridgeshire and Peterborough combined authority, which is reviewing all the area\u2019s bus routes, will visit Ramsey later this month, and Sills\u2019 group of residents intends to lobby him hard. \u201cHe should know by now just how important it is for people on low incomes and for young people that they\u2019re not trapped in a small town with their life chances inhibited,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Sills has a strong card up her sleeve. As well as marshalling a petition that gained more than 1,000 signatures \u2013 and secured a short-term stay of execution for the route \u2013 members of her group decided to use some of the Big Local Lottery money they had been awarded to strengthen their case. A report commissioned from the Campaign for Better Transport revealed that the local authority subsidy paid to the bus operator Stagecoach to run the No 30 bus is the lowest of any on the list of proposed route closures in Cambridgeshire.</p> <p>The report also showed, Sills says, \u201chow Ramsey already compares poorly to other parts of the county\u201d in terms of its access to buses.</p> <p>If Cambridgeshire\u2019s long-term transport strategy is ratified later this year \u2013 it is the new Cambridgeshire and Peterborough combined authority, not Ramsey town council, that will set commissioning policy until 2031 \u2013 Ramsey will be cut off from the new \u201chub and spoke\u201d public transport system. There will be no buses in or out at all.</p> <p>Ramsey\u2019s residents, of course, are not alone in their plight. The Campaign for Better Transport calculates that since 2010, councils in England and Wales have cut \u00a3182m \u2013 45% \u2013 from the support they give to bus routes that would otherwise be unsustainable. Some areas have seen particularly harsh cuts: Somerset by 50%, Leicestershire by 72%, North Yorkshire by 81%. In the past year alone, according to the charity\u2019s recent <a href=\"https://bettertransport.org.uk/buses-in-crisis-2018\" title=\"\">Buses in Crisis report</a>, more than 300 routes have been reduced or withdrawn in England and Wales, and 3,347 since 2010.</p> <p>\u201cWhole areas are now transport deserts,\u201d says the charity\u2019s chief executive, Darren Shirley. \u201cThe people who are the most impacted are those who are most in need of public transport. Jobseekers who are reliant on public transport to get to work. People in poor health who need it to get to hospital.\u201d Buses, he points out, are the only form of transport in England not to have a long-term investment strategy.</p> <p>We walk past fields of sugar beet, along straight, flat roads, and through the villages of Upwood, Great Raveley and Kings Ripton \u2013 just over halfway \u2013 where we sink thankfully on to a bench in front of St Peter\u2019s church. Munching on cereal bars, I ask Taylor if he has had any job offers that would mean he didn\u2019t have to keep signing on at the Huntingdon jobcentre.</p> <p>\u201cThere are one or two jobs out there for me, but I think what puts a lot of people off is that employers know what the bus situation is in Ramsey,\u201d he says, with some frustration. \u201cI\u2019ve had offers but I couldn\u2019t get there for the start times.\u201d The existing three-hourly bus service runs only in the daytime, so he can\u2019t do shift work into the evening or overnight. It is suddenly obvious how reducing rural buses to a skeleton service prevents people who could work from holding down a job.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d91d91e7b1c079f1b6f575cd803373a7af0ddd27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d91d91e7b1c079f1b6f575cd803373a7af0ddd27/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The bus stop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bus stop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re starting to undermine the fabric of the places that are more isolated,\u201d says Nigel Wilcock, the executive director at the Institute of Economic Development. \u201cThe figures on how much money has been lost by local authorities are staggering. Councils are almost faced with: \u2018Do we provide adult social care or do we keep bus routes going?\u2019\u201d When it comes to rural transport, Wilcock says: \u201cCampaigns now have got to be about addressing the funding settlement from central government.\u201d</p> <p>As we tramp onwards, it is becoming obvious that this isn\u2019t a walk that should be done by anyone who is not in decent physical nick, and with sharp hearing and eyesight to boot. Although Sills\u2019 Ordnance Survey skills take us along back roads, away from Taylor\u2019s usual path (he follows the bus route, a good stretch of which is on the busy A141), we still have to keep jumping on to the muddy verge, taking care not to end up in deep drainage ditches which run alongside the fields, to avoid cars and tractors.</p> <p>About 10 miles in, as we pass Jubilee Park, the home of Huntingdon Town FC, Sills\u2019 hips are starting to hurt. Taylor\u2019s ankle, which he sprained badly a couple of years ago, is twingeing. My left ankle too \u2013 a weak point \u2013 is feeling crunchy. At 12.25pm, aching and hungry, we reach Huntingdon\u2019s council offices where, because he is being switched over to universal credit, Taylor must sign on every week. His only consolation is that this will eventually become every fortnight.</p> <p>It has taken just over four hours to do 10.8 miles \u2013 Sills\u2019 nifty navigation has nibbled a mile off Taylor\u2019s usual route \u2013 and nobody fancies a return trip via shanks\u2019s pony, with the light failing halfway through. Today, of course, there is a bus that can take us back to Ramsey. So we head to the bus station, where we meet Ramsey resident Rosetta Casey, 75, who is waiting for the No 30 after a day\u2019s shopping.</p> <p>Casey hasn\u2019t heard that the route is due to be axed. She throws up her hands in dismay. \u201cI can\u2019t live here without it. I can\u2019t drive.\u201d She shakes her head vigorously. \u201cI\u2019ll be stuck in Ramsey then. What are we doing to do?\u201d</p> <p>On the bus, Sally Greaves, 58, says her son, who has special needs, uses the service four days a week to get to college. \u201cHe\u2019s doing a gardening course. He needs the early bus in the morning. He knows this route and if they disrupt it, he\u2019ll struggle.\u201d</p> <p>As we zoom down the A141, 20-year-old single mother Knickita Crampton rocks 16-month-old George in his pushchair. Crampton travels into Huntingdon five days a week to visit her family after the council housed her in Ramsey, where she knows hardly anyone. Without the bus, she says: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to see my mum. She doesn\u2019t drive, and I can\u2019t afford a taxi.\u201d</p> <p>With no more money in the local government pot \u2013 in fact with cuts still to come \u2013 what can be done to bolster threatened rural bus services? Shirley cites the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/76-million-for-local-transport-in-rural-and-isolated-areas\" title=\"\">Total Transport pilots</a> that launched in 2015. This funded 37 rural and isolated areas to work out ways of combining various public agencies\u2019 transport budgets and timetables. School buses sit for hours not being used, he observes. The NHS spends a fortune getting patients to appointments, costs that only increase when rural bus services disappear. An estimated \u00a32bn, he says, is being spent annually on public transport services that are not joined up. Instead, says Shirley: \u201cIf you design a service to meet the collective needs of the community you can create efficiencies. Local authorities should be talking to the clinical commissioning groups, to people who commission school transport \u2026 all of these teams should be working together to design a more integrated system.\u201d</p> <p>An hour after getting on in Huntingdon, our little walking band disembarks the No 30. Ray is hoping he doesn\u2019t have to do the walk again every fortnight, rain or shine, if the bus gets cut \u2013 but he will if he has to, he says with a resigned grin.</p> <p>That may be all right for now \u2013 it may even keep him fit \u2013 but the idea of Knickita Crampton pushing her toddler son to Huntingdon and back is clearly ludicrous, as is the notion of Rosetta Casey taking to the roads into her late 70s. With no bus service, they, and many others in this village, will, as Sills fears, be trapped.</p>",

But the public face of the investigation of Trump\u2019s finances won\u2019t be Mueller. Leading the charge will be someone Trump cannot fire: California congressman Adam Schiff, newly installed chairman of the House intelligence committee and a former federal prosecutor himself.</p> <p>With Democrats having taken over the House, Trump faces a pack of potential antagonists. Newly installed chairs are ramping up plans to scrutinize corruption inside the Trump administration, investigate alleged attempts to profit from the presidency, and to review policies such as family border separations.</p> <p>But most threatening for Trump personally might be the investigations led by Schiff, who has said he plans to drive directly at an area the president has sought to fence off: the details of his businesses, his lenders, and his partners in the US and abroad.</p> <p>\u201cFirst and foremost, I would say that we need to get to the bottom of anything that could warp our national security policy in a way that is antithetical to the interest of the country,\u201d Schiff <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/lawfare-podcast-congressman-adam-schiff-future-house-intelligence-committee\">told the Lawfare podcast</a>. \u201cSo anything that has a continuing ability to influence the actions of the president, we need to know, as policymakers, to protect the country.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the issues that has continued to concern me are the persistent allegations that the Trumps, when they couldn\u2019t get money from US banks, were laundering Russian money. If that is true, that would be more powerful compromise than any salacious video tape or any aborted Trump tower deal.\u201d</p> <p>Schiff might break new ground by using his power to subpoena documents from banks, phone companies or other sources, said Andy Wright, a former counsel to the House oversight committee and <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/author/wrightandy/\">founding editor</a> of the Just Security blog.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"796fa82cb35f8a38316395d918932e264b01e571\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/796fa82cb35f8a38316395d918932e264b01e571/0_278_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Mueller is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 US election, and links between the Trump campaign and Moscow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Mueller is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 US election, and links between the Trump campaign and Moscow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Maddaloni/CQ-Roll Call,Inc.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think that there\u2019s actually going to be quite a bit of fruitful evidence turned up,\u201d Wright said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the evidence is, whether it\u2019s going to be incriminating or not. But I don\u2019t think that the sort of conventional wisdom, that Trump\u2019s just going to drag his feet or strike a \u2018<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2018/nov/08/trump-warns-of-warlike-posture-if-his-opponents-investigate-him-video\">warlike posture</a>\u2019, is going to be that effective, because the smart investigators aren\u2019t going to go directly at him. They\u2019re going to go to third parties first.\u201d</p> <p>One of the first matters he plans to investigate, Schiff <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/schiff-said-he-wants-obtain-trump-s-deutsche-bank-records-n948541\">told NBC last month</a>, is the Trump Organization\u2019s relationship with Deutsche Bank, for a time reportedly Trump\u2019s exclusive lender, which was fined $700m in 2017 for allowing money laundering.</p> <p>\u201cThe concern about Deutsche Bank is that they have a history of laundering Russian money,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cAnd this, apparently, was the one bank that was willing to do business with the Trump Organization. If this is a form of compromise, it needs to be exposed.\u201d</p> <p>A graduate of Stanford and Harvard, Schiff, 58, began his career as an assistant US attorney in the Los Angeles district, where he successfully prosecuted Richard Miller, the first FBI agent to be convicted of espionage. As a young politician, Schiff was cultivated by Nancy Pelosi, then head of California\u2019s congressional delegation, now, again, speaker of the House.</p> <p>Schiff is a triathlete, a screenwriter and a vegan. He also likes to go on television, where he has caught the attention of the president, who last year responded to a critique with a tweet mocking the congressman\u2019s last name and floating a misleading notion about the statute governing the special counsel:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1064216956679716864\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate, but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate!</p>&mdash; Donald J.

We\u2019re in a very nasty environment in Washington DC right now. The atmosphere is poisonous after the 2016 election. Everyone has a responsibility to get past that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/23/adam-schiff-subpoena-power-trump-mueller-final-report\">Schiff will use subpoena powers if Trump quashes final Mueller report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Schiff takes over a committee that has been badly tarnished in the eyes of the public and, significantly, in the regard of the intelligence community. Under Devin Nunes, a Trump confidant who served on the transition team, the committee raised hackles by releasing classified material describing scrutiny of a former Trump aide.</p> <p>Schiff has called the episode \u201ca spectacular breach of a compact we have with the intelligence community\u201d and said \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to restore that\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf the committee does its job in the right manner, it shouldn\u2019t be antagonistic to any particular president or the executive branch generally,\u201d Jaffer said. \u201cIt should be doing good, effective oversight.\u201d</p> <p>Under Nunes, the committee ended conversations with the special counsel\u2019s office about what witnesses might be called and other matters. Schiff has said he will restore that communication.</p> <p>On Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/06/trump-aides-could-face-perjury-charges-mueller-investigation\">he told CNN</a> the committee would be handing over transcripts of closed-door testimony, something Republican leaders did not do. Schiff did not name names but such a move could place in jeopardy Trump aides including Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner and Roger Stone.</p> <p>But the role of Congress is fundamentally different from the special counsel\u2019s job, Schiff told Lawfare, especially given concerns that a report issued by Mueller might in some way be suppressed in a justice department run by Whitaker, apparently a staunch Trump loyalist.</p> <p>\u201cI think ultimately it will fall on Congress to make sure that the American people will get to hear the full story,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cEither through our own investigation or Bob Mueller\u2019s or a combination of both.</p> <p>\u201cThe American people have the right to know, and I think in many cases the <em>need</em> to know, what happened.\u201d</p>",

Leading the charge will be someone Trump cannot fire: California congressman Adam Schiff, newly installed chairman of the House intelligence committee and a former federal prosecutor himself. With Democrats having taken over the House, Trump faces a pack of potential antagonists. Newly installed chairs are ramping up plans to scrutinize corruption inside the Trump administration, investigate alleged attempts to profit from the presidency, and to review policies such as family border separations. But most threatening for Trump personally might be the investigations led by Schiff, who has said he plans to drive directly at an area the president has sought to fence off: the details of his businesses, his lenders, and his partners in the US and abroad. \u201cFirst and foremost, I would say that we need to get to the bottom of anything that could warp our national security policy in a way that is antithetical to the interest of the country,\u201d Schiff told the Lawfare podcast. \u201cSo anything that has a continuing ability to influence the actions of the president, we need to know, as policymakers, to protect the country. \u201cOne of the issues that has continued to concern me are the persistent allegations that the Trumps, when they couldn\u2019t get money from US banks, were laundering Russian money. If that is true, that would be more powerful compromise than any salacious video tape or any aborted Trump tower deal.\u201d Schiff might break new ground by using his power to subpoena documents from banks, phone companies or other sources, said Andy Wright, a former counsel to the House oversight committee and founding editor of the Just Security blog. \u201cI think that there\u2019s actually going to be quite a bit of fruitful evidence turned up,\u201d Wright said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the evidence is, whether it\u2019s going to be incriminating or not. But I don\u2019t think that the sort of conventional wisdom, that Trump\u2019s just going to drag his feet or strike a \u2018warlike posture\u2019, is going to be that effective, because the smart investigators aren\u2019t going to go directly at him. They\u2019re going to go to third parties first.\u201d One of the first matters he plans to investigate, Schiff told NBC last month, is the Trump Organization\u2019s relationship with Deutsche Bank, for a time reportedly Trump\u2019s exclusive lender, which was fined $700m in 2017 for allowing money laundering. \u201cThe concern about Deutsche Bank is that they have a history of laundering Russian money,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cAnd this, apparently, was the one bank that was willing to do business with the Trump Organization. If this is a form of compromise, it needs to be exposed.\u201d A graduate of Stanford and Harvard, Schiff, 58, began his career as an assistant US attorney in the Los Angeles district, where he successfully prosecuted Richard Miller, the first FBI agent to be convicted of espionage. As a young politician, Schiff was cultivated by Nancy Pelosi, then head of California\u2019s congressional delegation, now, again, speaker of the House. Schiff is a triathlete, a screenwriter and a vegan. He also likes to go on television, where he has caught the attention of the president, who last year responded to a critique with a tweet mocking the congressman\u2019s last name and floating a misleading notion about the statute governing the special counsel: While Schiff has shown he can fire back at Trump, he will need to steer clear of such partisan warfare to be an effective committee chairman, said Jamil N Jaffer, founder of the National Security Institute at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University and a former senior counsel to the committee Schiff now leads. \u201cSchiff has an opportunity now to try and change that tone, because as the chairman he can set the tone,\u201d Jaffer said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if he\u2019s able to do that successfully. We\u2019re in a very nasty environment in Washington DC right now. The atmosphere is poisonous after the 2016 election. Everyone has a responsibility to get past that.\u201d Schiff takes over a committee that has been badly tarnished in the eyes of the public and, significantly, in the regard of the intelligence community. Under Devin Nunes, a Trump confidant who served on the transition team, the committee raised hackles by releasing classified material describing scrutiny of a former Trump aide. Schiff has called the episode \u201ca spectacular breach of a compact we have with the intelligence community\u201d and said \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to restore that\u201d. \u201cIf the committee does its job in the right manner, it shouldn\u2019t be antagonistic to any particular president or the executive branch generally,\u201d Jaffer said. \u201cIt should be doing good, effective oversight.\u201d Under Nunes, the committee ended conversations with the special counsel\u2019s office about what witnesses might be called and other matters. Schiff has said he will restore that communication. On Sunday, he told CNN the committee would be handing over transcripts of closed-door testimony, something Republican leaders did not do. Schiff did not name names but such a move could place in jeopardy Trump aides including Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner and Roger Stone. But the role of Congress is fundamentally different from the special counsel\u2019s job, Schiff told Lawfare, especially given concerns that a report issued by Mueller might in some way be suppressed in a justice department run by Whitaker, apparently a staunch Trump loyalist. \u201cI think ultimately it will fall on Congress to make sure that the American people will get to hear the full story,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cEither through our own investigation or Bob Mueller\u2019s or a combination of both. \u201cThe American people have the right to know, and I think in many cases the need to know, what happened.\u201d",

Maybe Google\u2019s offer to its users is too simple, and the company\u2019s dimensions now far too big to allow any space for alternatives. Besides, if anyone began to make headway by offering us greater privacy and control, we would hear plenty of protests about how severing the connection between huge data sets and the growth of artificial intelligence would be to hand the dominance of AI to China, where the twin forces of surveillance and innovation are stampeding on. I only know this: that tangled up in all this stuff are elemental questions about how we are going to live.

One glaring truth about the modern internet should be at the core of any meaningful conversation about it. From pluralistic, egalitarian beginnings, it has been transformed into a top-down system dominated by a few big players whose power is based on their control of data, with Google as the king. So perhaps something truly radical is required: a reconceptualisation of what the internet is, and what happens to the data that determines who controls it. As the year unfolds, pay attention to the people who are talking about a new, decentralised internet \u2013 AKA Web 3.0 \u2013 and the possibility of data being returned to the control of the people who generate it. In Boston, the worldwide web\u2019s founder, Tim Berners-Lee, is working on a new way of using the internet. Called Solid, it is based around personal online data stores, or Pods, that contain the wealth of information people generate, and are their exclusive property. This means they can allow access to particular elements of their data from particular services as they see fit, and move their data from app to app instead of surrendering it (imagine, for example, being able to move between social networks, taking your lists of friends and followers with you). Berners-Lee and his people are also working on a new kind of digital assistant they have named Charlie, the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of which is the careful use of personal information, to make individual lives easier and better, rather than the idea of using it to sell us things (\u201cCharlie works for you; Charlie doesn\u2019t work for Google or Amazon\u201d). Then there are the possibilities bound up with the blockchain, the system of verification that sits under so-called cryptocurrencies. For instance, the blockchain offers a means of independently verified personal identity, which respects privacy far better than the Google and Facebook accounts do we are now encouraged to use across the internet. Blockchain technology has also opened the way to new models whereby endless micropayments can be made in return for particular online services or content; and, if people voluntarily allow elements of their data to be used, rewards can flow the other way. Here perhaps lies the key to a system beyond the current, Google-led model, in which services appear to be free but the letting-go of personal data is the actual price.

In their system, using the internet to satisfy particular wants would not involve indiscriminately surrendering data but judiciously sending out digitised \u201cautonomous economic agents\u201d to get help as and when we needed it. If we wanted a ride to work, or minute-by-minute access to the cheapest electricity, this is how we would do it: via a system that repeatedly connected different permutations of buyers and sellers, rather than by privileging huge platforms that render the rest of us digital serfs. These ideas and models have the disadvantage of sounding offputtingly complicated, which could foster a certain fatalism. Maybe Google\u2019s offer to its users is too simple, and the company\u2019s dimensions now far too big to allow any space for alternatives. Besides, if anyone began to make headway by offering us greater privacy and control, we would hear plenty of protests about how severing the connection between huge data sets and the growth of artificial intelligence would be to hand the dominance of AI to China, where the twin forces of surveillance and innovation are stampeding on. I only know this: that tangled up in all this stuff are elemental questions about how we are going to live. And, even if it can play me my favourite song and tell me who\u2019s at the door, Google does not have the answers. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Before the night had began, many predicted that the 76th Golden Globes ceremony would be dominated by a film about a singer with ambitious dreams. Now, as the night ends, no one expected it would be Bohemian Rhapsody. The Lady Gaga/Bradley Cooper remake of A Star is Born is by no means a film that deserved to win big tonight but it seemed so suited for the Globes and ultimately it was handed the best original song award while losing out on best drama to the critically savaged Queen biopic. It was a shock finale to a night that offered a number of surprises. While it wasn\u2019t that shocking to see crowd-pleasing yet problematic comedy Green Book win big, no one expected quite so much from Netflix comedy The Kominsky Method or that Richard Madden and Patricia Arquette would win in categories stuffed with big name talent. Brits did well across the board and going into the Oscars it\u2019s looking like Olivia Colman will be facing off against Glenn Close for best actress while Rami Malek could provide another upset. Will the Bryan Singer controversy finally catch up with the film? Nominations will be out soon but it\u2019s another wild and unpredictable Oscar race, as hard to call as who will host the damn thing. For now, that\u2019s all from us but there will be further analysis in the AM. Here\u2019s a full wrap of tonight\u2019s madness: And we interviewed Globe winner Glenn Close at the very start of The Wife\u2019s rollout back in 2017 Here\u2019s a bit more background on Green Book, which picked up three major awards tonight, including best motion picture - musical or comedy Something to look forward to... While Jeff Bridges\u2019 speech was one of the night\u2019s barmiest: And in case you haven\u2019t seen it yet, Olivia Colman\u2019s speech was one of the night\u2019s most genuine moments: It\u2019s going to be an interesting obstacle course for those involved with both Green Book and Bohemian Rhapsody from now until the Oscars with both facing very different controversies. In the press room, Green Book producer Octavia Spencer was asked about the response from the real Don Shirley\u2019s family Did it happen again? While many are upset with Green Book and Bohemian Rhapsody winning best picture, comedy and drama respectively, it\u2019s worth remembering that the Globes often rewards films that don\u2019t end up winning the best picture Oscar. Last year saw Three Billboards and Lady Bird win while The Shape of Water won at the Oscars and while Moonlight might have won both the year before, 2016 saw The Revenant and The Martian coming out on top only for Spotlight to win an Oscar. So in other words, there\u2019s still hope. In case you want to relive this harrowing night then here\u2019s the full list of winners. Finally, a Bird Box joke that works. There are some thoughts about a Bryan Singer movie winning top honours tonight. Huh? The Queen drama that was mostly, and rightfully, loathed by critics has won the night\u2019s biggest award in a shock finale. Quite how it beat out A Star is Born, which seemed destined to win, is a head-scratcher \u2013 and the far more deserving Black Panther as well. This is a real surprise and they\u2019re hard to come by in this season. Noticeably no reference to Bryan Singer in the speech yet again ... Beating out Bradley Cooper, who many thought would win, is Rami Malek, who was undoubtedly the best thing about the rather underwhelming Queen biopic. Malek is an intense speech-giver and interestingly, reassuringly after thanking everyone involved in the film, he decided not to thank the director, Bryan Singer, who has been accused of sexual assault. And now for the big one ... And now this picture means even more Here\u2019s the moment that Maya Rudolph propsed to Amy Poehler in case you haven\u2019t seen it yet It felt like Lady Gaga might scoop in here and win, especially given how much the Globes loves her, but a nice semi-surprise to see Glenn Close win for her powerful performance in The Wife. It\u2019s a small film and Close\u2019s speech is easily the night\u2019s most effective. She talks about women needing to find personal fulfillment outside of what they achieve in the home or in a marriage, referencing her mother who gave so much of herself to her husband without looking out for herself. It\u2019s tearful and rousing and it would take a bullet train to derail her chances of winning the Oscar as well. The Green Book blowback is the new Kominsky Method blowback. Another win here for a film that\u2019s starting to receive quite a backlash: the crowd-pleasing road trip comedy Green Book. It\u2019s a crowd-pleaser for sure and its broad moments surely appealed to voters more than the misanthropic humour of The Favourite. It\u2019ll definitely score a host of Oscar nominations but can the growing collection of voices against it eventually derail its chances of winning? Remember about five hours ago when I said that the Fiji water girl would be getting a parody Twitter account? Well, yeah: Finally The Favourite wins something, and happily for Olivia Colman\u2019s tragic and bizarro lead turn, beating out Emily Blunt and Constance Wu. Firstly, Colman thanked someone for the sandwiches, who we assume must have been Melissa McCarthy, who smuggled in some ham sandwiches for anyone who was hungry. She\u2019s infectiously happy to be up there and thanks her \u201cbitches\u201d before swearing, which is bleeped out but makes total sense given how bawdy The Favourite is. Whoever wins the best actress in a drama category is about to be her greatest competition next month. Yeah about that Kominsky Method win... While sitting in the audience watching Emily Blunt on stage, Barry Jenkins has reminded us all of a very important fact. A rather divisive choice, since it\u2019s a show that left some cold \u2013 unlike, say, Sharp Objects or A Very English Scandal, which lost out \u2013 but again Ryan Murphy leaves an awards ceremony as the undisputed king of TV. There\u2019s a rather great speech about the importance of LGBT representation and fighting back against hatred against the community: \u201cOur show is a period piece but those forces are not historical.\u201d Backstage, the Globe winner Mahershala Ali has addressed the controversy swirling around the truth behind Green Book. According to Deadline: \u201cI will say this,\u201d Ali said, \u201cmy job is always the same: I have to look at what I am doing and be responsible for it.\u201d He says he and everyone working on the film put a lot energy into the project and he does not want to \u201cthrow away\u201d what everyone has done. \u201cI respect the family \u2026 and Doc Shirley,\u201d he said. \u201cI spoke to the studio and the family and at the end of the day you wish everyone was happy and you don\u2019t want to offend anyone in any capacity.\u201d Over on Instagram, Natalie Portman has gone Black Swan again Oof, quite a shock here for a show that really didn\u2019t make much of an impact when Netflix launched it last year. It\u2019s the second award of the night, after Michael Douglas won best actor in a comedy series, and it revealed the HFPA yet again to be rather out of sync with critics and audiences. With Roma and this though, it\u2019s quite the night for Netflix. Yet again, proof that awards voters love Amazon\u2019s period comedy more than critics seem to, with Rachel Brosnahan winning her second Globe for her role as a stand-up comic. She beat out a rather weak category, adding yet another trophy to Maisel\u2019s shelf after it won big at last year\u2019s Emmys. In her speech, she praises the female-heavy crew of the show and speaks with the same speed as her character as she\u2019s told to wrap it up. More awards coming literally straight after ... In one of the more surprising stories of the night, Melissa McCarthy is apparently handing out ham and cheese sandwiches to guests. \u201cI\u2019ve been handing them out to everyone,\u201d McCarthy told Variety. \u201cNext year, I\u2019m bringing hot dogs.\u201d In what reads like a parody story, there\u2019s also a reaction from Jessica Chastain. \u201cHow did she get them in here?\u201d she wondered, \u201cBut it\u2019s a good idea because by the time you get into the ballroom dinner has already been served, and you\u2019re always so hungry.\u201d Will keep an eye out for further celeb reactions/pictures of sandwiches being eaten. Phew. This was a category with some serious potholes (no thanks, Adam McKay!) but Cuar\u00f3n is the entirely deserving winner for his splendid work on the Netflix drama. He comments that he feels he cheated as he was just watching great women exist on screen and that the film was really directed by his family. Tonight couldn\u2019t have been better for Roma and sets it on track to win big at the Oscars next month. Also she\u2019s become the icon she deserved to become: Now it\u2019s time for Jeff Bridges to pick up this year\u2019s Cecil B DeMille award for achievement in film. The last two years have seen this moment turn into a major talking point with Meryl Streep and Oprah Winfrey using their time on stage to deliver hair-raising, water cooler speeches. After a shoddily assembled montage that ended with his most iconic role, voicing a penguin in Surf\u2019s Up, Bridges arrives to deliver a far more formulaic, if still charmingly rambling stoner speech. There\u2019s a great supercut of confused celebrity reactions that needs to be made and I will spend a considerable amount of time searching for it later. And the Poehler/Rudolph Oscars hosts campaign starts here: Damn, a category full of big names that was taken down by Darren Criss. Beating out Hugh Grant, Antonio Banderas and Benedict Cumberbatch is the ex-Glee star who received plaudits for his role as a killer in the second season of American Crime Story. It wouldn\u2019t be a TV awards night without at least one Ryan Murphy actor picking something up and while Gianni Versace hasn\u2019t been quite the trophy magnet that OJ Simpson was, Murphy continues to showcase his ability to lead actors up on stage. Another foregone conclusion of the night and an entirely fitting win for Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s black and white Netflix masterpiece. Given the Globes\u2019 rather strange rules, foreign language films aren\u2019t eligible for the main best picture categories, which took Roma out of the big races. Cuar\u00f3n praises the importance of cinema for breaking down walls and building bridges in the middle of a very personal speech. Could he be back on stage to pick up best director later tonight? Gosh, a weak category here and no real surprise that Christian Bale won out as a result. Vice is the most-nominated film of the evening and even though it\u2019s losing critical steam, even its harshest detractors have praised the performances of Bale and his co-star Amy Adams. Bale is on enthusiastic form, not always the case, and he\u2019s quipping like there\u2019s no tomorrow, thanking his wife for stopping him from saying too much \u201cdumb crap\u201d while also thanking Satan for inspiring him to play Dick Cheney. He also jokes that he\u2019s playing Mitch McConnell next. A suitably funny speech for a comedic winner. A tough category here, but making up for that Amy Adams snub earlier is a deserving win for Patricia Clarkson, who gave great gothic in HBO\u2019s sweaty thriller Sharp Objects. \u201cYou demanded everything from me except sex, which is exactly how it should be in our industry,\u201d she says to her director. Given that he didn\u2019t win for Moonlight, this does seem like a solid explanation: Poehler and Rudolph remained on stage for another wonderful skit involving a fake proposal that Bradley Cooper didn\u2019t seem to appreciate. Wow, a surprise here given that, ya know, The Favourite was nominated. Two awards in a row for Green Book, a film that does seem like catnip for the HFPA given its crowd-pleasing emotional notes. Could it continue on and win best picture as well? It\u2019s been a strange skit-free night for the presenters, but here to put an end to that are Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph, who delivered some genuine laughs on the importance of supporting actors (footage to follow). A deserving win here for Mahershala Ali, in a film that\u2019s been getting some flak lately for those questioning how true its story is. It\u2019s a big year for Ali, with his True Detective season about to start, and this pushes him to the top of a category that\u2019s a tad under-powered this year. Brie update. She\u2019s confused: In an ultra-competitive category, the host Sandra Oh has won out for her role in a series that has received passionate acclaim ever since it aired last year. Oh seemed surprised and delivered a genuinely emotional speech, ultimately devoting it to her parents, who were in attendance. It\u2019s been a rather special night for Oh even without this victory, showcasing her often under-seen comic chops on stage. This will undoubtedly lead to a boost in her onscreen presence in the future. Another one of tonight\u2019s awards that was a tad easier to predict: Regina King has received universal acclaim for her role in Barry Jenkins\u2019 James Baldwin follow-up. It\u2019s a heartfelt, tender performance and she\u2019s now going into the Oscars as the favourite in this category (even in one with two actors from The Favourite). Rather awkward music playing her off as she starts to talk about Time\u2019s Up; the music was then rather sensibly turned off. When she was then given a chance she revealed that with everything she is producing in the future, she will insist on 50% of the crew being female, similar to a promise made by Michael B Jordan recently. Fiji Water Girl is getting a parody Twitter account in T-minus five minutes: In case you haven\u2019t seen it then here\u2019s tonight\u2019s monologue in full: Metz update. She is denying: One of the most foregone conclusions tonight was that Gaga would win for her show-stopping song from A Star is Born. Firstly, it\u2019s worth rewatching the moment that Taylor Swift goes in for a second kiss with Gaga and misreads the situation. Secondly, Mark Ronson mostly grabs the mic for this one but Gaga will probably be able to give another speech later in the evening ... It\u2019s been a skit-free night for presenters tonight and that continues here with Idris Elba and Taylor Swift essentially appearing on stage to open an envelope and nothing else. Justin Hurwitz is the big winner here for his work on First Man, a film that\u2019s struggled a bit during this season. It\u2019s criminal that If Beale Street Could Talk wasn\u2019t nominated but hey. Rather fittingly given the rise in respect for the small screen, the Globes has launched a new award aimed at recognising achievement in television. The Carol Burnett award will sit alongside the Cecil B DeMille award from now on and in its first year it\u2019s being handed to ... Carol Burnett. Steve Carell is on hand to present to the 85-year-old comedian and host of The Carol Burnett Show, calling it the \u201cgreatest honour\u201d of his life. After a standing ovation, Burnett delivers a touching, articulate speech about the importance of television. Jeff Bridges will be appearing later to pick up the big screen equivalent. Rather awkwardly, the This is Us star Chrissy Metz was caught on her mic before the show referring to Glow star Allison Brie as \u201csuch a bitch\u201d in a story that\u2019s currently making the rounds. Here ya go: Quite a competitive category here and quite a shock result. Amy Adams was seen as the frontrunner for her career-best work in the HBO miniseries Sharp Objects but flying under the radar is the Ben Stiller-directed fact-based drama Escape From Dannemora. Patricia Arquette is an expert speech-giver and she delivers yet more sterling work here helping to sell a show that needed the boost and will likely lead to a lot of people now Googling just where they can watch it. She went on a bit too long for the producers, who had to cut her speech short with music. A fair few surprises so far, which is nice on a night like this. Many had expected Henry Winkler to win this one for Barry but wow, a lovely surprise given how wonderful Ben Whishaw was in the brilliant BBC drama. He devotes the award to the character he played for being a true queer hero and an icon. It\u2019s looking like a good night for the Brits thus far. There\u2019s a quick word now about donations from the HFPA of $1m to two non-profit non-partisan organisations aimed at helping journalists who are under threat. It\u2019s a nice touch and carries weight given the current climate. ... or maybe not. The final season of the critically adored FX thriller has won the big dramatic TV award of the night (announced insanely uncharacteristically early) and it makes sense. It was predicted to win given that it was the show\u2019s last season and could be seen as a way of rewarding the show as a whole. Can Keri Russell also win best actress in a drama series for her work in the final season? Given how manic and speedy tonight has been so far, I imagine we\u2019ll find out in about three seconds. Quite a surprise here for a show that\u2019s been endlessly talked about but was still something of an outsider against bigger American shows from Homecoming to The Americans. Madden also seems incredibly surprised but very grateful and it suggests the show could be grabbing some more later on. Plenty of great saucy jokes with the cast of The Favourite talking about tongues and hands and body parts and a great reminder that a film as rude and filthy as The Favourite is in the awards conversation this year. Here\u2019s that Emma Stone yelling sorry for Aloha clip that\u2019s arguably the best bit so far tonight Ooh, this is a deserving winner. Sony\u2019s thrilling, funny, heartfelt animated Spidey spin-off was a rather lovely surprise when it was released last month. It\u2019s also pretty major that Sony Animation has won out over Disney and could well do the same at the Oscars. But oof the music came in early to cut off the last of the winning group and it happened just as he was talking about the importance of diversity. Not a great look. A very worthwhile reminder here that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association is obsessed with big stars above all else. Michael Douglas winning for a show that has had roughly zero impact with critics and audiences says quite a bit, especially over Bill Hader in Barry (a show everyone loves) and Donald Glover in Atlanta (a show everyone adores). Let\u2019s see how many other big stars win in categories they don\u2019t deserve to... It\u2019s here! After a burgundy-coloured red carpet, Sandra Oh and Andy Samberg are on stage. Within a few minutes, they\u2019ve already made two Kevin Hart-based jokes about how hard is it to find an Oscars host. The pair is also ridiculing the fact that they\u2019re not exactly known for saying mean things so they\u2019re going around the room saying nice things about celebrities. They have chemistry but the joke is a tad overplayed, making one relive Poehler and Fey\u2019s brilliant, acidic monologues of years past. There\u2019s a bizarre garbled Black Panther joke that was followed by a very confused Ryan Coogler which seems like the stuff of gifs. Slightly more successful is a jab at Lady Gaga\u2019s much-repeated A Star is Born interview quote about there being 100 people in the room. They find a rhythm soon after going through nominated films and performances with lightning-fast jokes (a jab about Emma Stone playing an Asian character in Aloha led to her shouting \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d). Lots of references to how diverse this year\u2019s nominees are (not always the case with the Globes) but we\u2019ll have to see how diverse the winners are (remember the Emmys last year). Timothee Chalamet has gone rogue, eschewing a suit for head-to-tow black with a sequin holster (holsters are big news for SS19 people FYI). We\u2019re predicting a love-hate reaction to this one - we\u2019re going with the former; we like this experimental streak from him. If you thought her recent Harpers Bazaar cover was Saoirse Ronan at her most glam, think again. The Mary Queen of Scots star is wearing a custom Gucci gown with crystal detailing. Saoirse Queen of Frocks? While the pairing of Sandra Oh and Andy Samberg might seem about as random as that of previous Oscars hosts Anne Hathaway and James Franco, the two have experience on stage together, presenting as part of last year\u2019s Emmys. This bodes well: All hail sharp tailoring - top points to Rami rocking white tie and Julia bossing it (as ever) in a trouser-cum-skirt ensemble. Place your legal living room-based bets with help from our chief film critic Peter Bradshaw\u2019s predictions along with his picks for what should have been nominated. Spoiler: he\u2019s rather miffed about Widows being snubbed. Melissa McCarthy has gone full purple this evening and we\u2019re seeing yet more sequins, this time in scattered star-shapes. She\u2019s nominated for best actress \u2013 drama for her role in Can You Ever Forgive Me? and, according to her Instagram, was busy sheet-masking earlier this evening in preparation for the awards. Brit Emily Blunt, aka Mary Poppins, has been dressed by Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen on the red carpet tonight \u2013 she who also designed the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s wedding dress (although yes, this is more racy than royal). Supercalifragilisticexpial ... etc etc. A lesson in how to pull off a plunging neckline from Taraji P Henson, who\u2019s wearing a custom Vera Wang dress in green velvet. Oh and diamonds, lots of \u2019em. Just. Look. At. That. Train. Brava Lady Gaga, who can always be trusted to bring her A-game to the red carpet. Beautifully fitted, the lavender puff sleeves and full skirt is serious Cinderella territory and she is rocking it. It\u2019s said to be by Valentino, whom Gaga has worn several times while promoting A Star Is Born, the film that may see her win the Best Actress - Drama award tonight. There\u2019ll be a ton of A-listers in attendance tonight and not just those waiting impatiently to find out if they\u2019ve won. As usual, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association has assembled a starry line-up of presenters who will hopefully create a few memorable skits, the likes of which have helped to make the Globes a more watchable ceremony in years past. This year\u2019s crop includes Harrison Ford, Chadwick Boseman, Saoirse Ronan, Idris Elba, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jessica Chastain, Sterling K Brown, Halle Berry, Nicole Kidman, Emily Blunt, Taraji P Henson, Kristen Bell, Emma Stone, Mike Myers and Michael B Jordan. For anyone who\u2019s ever seen Amy Sherman-Palladino, this is big news. Hold the front page: Michelle Yeoh is wearing THAT green ring from Crazy Rich Asians. We officially couldn\u2019t love her more. Fun fashion fact: the ring actually belonged to Yeoh personally long before she was cast in the smash hit of 2018 that\u2019s hoping to win in two categories tonight. Favourite red-carpet detail so far. A Good Place has led to a great prank? Rosamund Pike is not messing about in this black dress paired with a sequin jacket. She\u2019s nominated for best actress in a drama for her role in A Private War but Twitter is murmuring about her \u201cwarrior\u201d vibes and, of course, #bigdickenergy. Sunshine yellow satin isn\u2019t the easiest to pull off, but this is a good look for Claire Foy. We\u2019re also a fan of thematic references \u2013 she\u2019s nominated for best supporting actress for the space-travel drama First Man and those sequin appliqu\u00e9d starbursts look suitably out of this world. The old Hollywood styling suits her vibe too. Pleased to see you Mr Bond, er, sorry, we mean Mr Bodyguard. Richard Madden has arrived looking slick in a tux. The actor (whose BBC hit is nominated in the best TV series \u2013 drama category) has clearly picked up some styling tips from his recent GQ cover shoot. Looking anything but shaken ... Jameela Jamil obviously got the Pantone memo \u2013 she\u2019s wearing a strapless dress in the colour of the year, \u201cliving coral\u201d. Earlier, The Good Place actor tweeted a video of herself wearing jeans underneath the dress because, as she put it, it\u2019s \u201cforking cold\u201d. Regina King may be nominated twice tonight (for Seven Seconds and If Beale Street Could Talk) but she\u2019s already a winner in floor-length pink mirrors and sequins. She clearly knows how to pull off a showstoper like this, keeping everything else #done-undone [insert audience applause here]. Oh was joined on the red carpet by her Killing Eve co-star Jodie Comer, all in black, as well as the show\u2019s script-writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge in cheerier red sequins. All three have gone floor-length, and look decidedly regal in their chosen gowns. Every year, the Globes names an ambassador who also happens to be the daughter, or less often son, of an A-list star. The position used to be referred to as Miss or Mr Golden Globe and has previously been filled by the offspring of Jamie Foxx, Jack Nicholson, Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Bacon and Andie MacDowell. This year it\u2019s the turn of Isan Elba, the 16-year-old daughter of Idris Elba, who won a Golden Globe in 2012 for his role in Luther. Isan has been on the interview circuit this week, the funniest tidbit of which saw her respond to her dad being named People\u2019s sexiest man alive last year. \u201cIt was quite uncomfortable,\u201d she said to People. \u201cI was looking forward to seeing who it was this year, probably Michael B Jordan or something like that but no, it was my dad ... I\u2019m handling it very well but inside I\u2019m grossed out.\u201d If the 2018 Golden Globes dress code was a blackout, 2019\u2019s female attendees are so far opting to show their solidarity in white. Co-host Sandra Oh and Jamie Lee Curtis have arrived wearing an asymmetric ruffled gown and power-shouldered floor-length dress respectively. We\u2019re into it. The #TimesUp movement is still sartorially present too - several guests have so far been spotted wearing #TimesUp bracelets and ribbons. For last year\u2019s ceremony, attendees decided to arrive wearing black as a way of paying tribute to the women who came forward with #MeToo stories but one actor, The Dog of Christmas star Blanca Blanco, garnered a whole heap of negative attention for wearing a red dress. She recently spoke to the Hollywood Reporter about what happened next. \u201cI wanted to stand strong and I felt so honored to be there, but what happened after I walked the red carpet was crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cPhotos of me went viral, I became a trending topic on Twitter, and I got death threats and tons of hate mail. I support #MeToo \u2013 it had nothing to do with not supporting the cause. It was incredible to see all the courageous women come forward over the past year. I take responsibility for wearing color while everyone else wore black.\u201d There was some Ocean\u2019s 8/11/12/13-style scammery going on this weekend according to Variety as a rather canny imposter managed to fool his way into W magazine\u2019s big Globes party on Friday. Apparently he dressed in a black suit and waited by the elevator that would take attendees up to the penthouse at the Chateau Marmont hotel. Pretending to be security, he managed to get the tickets from a number of actors including Keegan Michael-Key. Chaos ensued. Remember what happened the last time Lady Gaga won a Golden Globe? I mean, how could you ever forget... Last year\u2019s red carpet was dominated with talk of #MeToo and saw celebrities dressed in black with Time\u2019s Up pins attached. This year it\u2019s been revealed that stars will be wearing ribbons and/or bracelets to continue showing support for survivors of sexual assault. Here\u2019s a look from Arianne Phillips, the costume designer and stylist who created the pins worn last year and continues to work with the cause: A rather surrealist ad here teasing what to expect from hosts Sandra Oh and Andy Samberg, which will hopefully lead to an equally offbeat evening. And so it begins, once again. The 76th Golden Globes ceremony is mere hours away from kicking off this year\u2019s awards season and unlike the more sedate Oscars, it can be a sprightly, often raucous evening. Alcohol is served aplenty, leading to a looser atmosphere, and the host or hosts are usually allowed to insert some more daring jabs. The evening has few foregone conclusions. It\u2019s a strange race this year with a number of possible contenders but without a clear frontrunner. On the film side, Vice may lead with most nominations but it\u2019s losing steam with underwhelming box office and, more importantly, a lack of interest from critics. Could The Favourite scoop up the comedy awards instead? On the dramatic end, A Star is Born feels like the more Globe-friendly choice to win out and Lady Gaga may see herself taking home two awards, for actress and song. Without Big Little Lies (which returns next year) and The Handmaid\u2019s Tale (which was deservedly snubbed for its dull second season), the small screen trophies are likely to be spread between Sharp Objects, The Marvelous Mrs Maisel and The Assassination of Gianni Versace. What other excitement might the evening provide? The hosts, Sandra Oh and Andy Samberg, have promised a \u201ccrazy-pants\u201d atmosphere so that could mean a lot of things. We\u2019ll be here with red carpet commentary and then full coverage of the ceremony and the aftermath, so loosen up that bowtie and stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "The Golden Globes red carpet featured its share of scene-stealers: Lady Gaga in a dress with a train several metres long , Timothee Chalamet in a sequin holster, Melissa McCarthy dressed like a gorgeous, purple wizard, and Billy Porter in an embellished silk cape with a hot pink lining. But all of them were arguably outshone by the consistent appearance of a woman in a violet dress handing out bottles of Fiji water. The \u201cFiji Water Girl\u201d meme quickly caught the eye of viewers following the awards ceremony, as she appeared in the background of a variety of celebrity shots, photobombing Nicole Kidman, Dakota Fanning, Jim Carrey, Richard Madden, Emmy Rossum, Idris Elba and Judy Greer, among others. She was immediately noticed on Twitter, where some people called for her to be given the award for best supporting role. Fiji Water is the official bottled water partner for the Golden Globes, supplying water for the event since 2015 and the brand was quick to capitalise on people\u2019s interest, writing on Twitter: \u201cWe\u2019re so glad everyone is talking about our water! *senses ominous presence* She\u2019s right behind us, isn\u2019t she?\u201d But people\u2019s fascination had nothing to do with the water. It was the Fiji Water Girl herself who had captured people. Identified as model Kelleth Cuthbert, there she was, standing behind Cody Fern. As Fern was photographed, instead of looking away demurely, the Fiji Water Girl stared directly down the lens with an arched eyebrow and a half-smile, daring the camera to consider her a less worthy subject than the actor in front of her. She did the same, again and again throughout the evening, with an unerring sense of where the camera is and her best angles. It did not take long for a parody Twitter account to start, with someone tweeting on behalf of Fiji Water Girl. As well as the water girl\u2019s imagined response to claims she had \u201cphotobombed\u201d celebrities.",

      "bodyText": "A nine-year-old girl in Japan will become the youngest-ever professional player of the strategy board game go when she makes her debut later this year. Sumire Nakamura, who attends primary school in Osaka, started playing go at the age of three and will start her career at the lowest rank of shodan on 1 April, according to Japanese media. She will comfortably beat the record for the youngest professional held by Rina Fujisawa, who was aged 11 years and six months when she turned professional nine years ago. Nakamura, who was encouraged to play go by her father, Shinya, himself a ninth-degree professional player who won a national title in 1998, is the product of a special programme to nurture a new generation of top Japanese players who can compete with their Chinese and Korean counterparts in international tournaments. The primary school pupil honed her skills at tournaments involving other schoolchildren and recently sharpened her competitive edge in South Korea. Flanked by Japan Go Association officials and her parents, Sumire overcame her initial bashfulness to tell reporters at the weekend: \u201cI\u2019m happy when I win. I want to win a title while I\u2019m at junior high school.\u201d Go, which requires players to take control of territory on the board, is said to have originated in China more than 2,500 years ago and has an estimated 20 million active players, mainly in east Asia. Fans of go will be hoping that Nakamura\u2019s extraordinary rise will boost interest the game, in the same way Sota Fujii did for shogi, a Japanese version of chess. Fujii set a record for consecutive victories in professional shogi in 2017, aged just 14, winning plaudits from the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and sparking a surge of interest in the game. Last month, Fujii won his 100th official match, becoming the youngest professional player to reach the milestone. He also completed the feat faster than any other player.",

They are going to be looked up to for a long, long time at hoe. This is just a stepping stone for us. It is a young side. The most important thing for us is belief.

I think the culture we have been able to build over the last twelve months, the transition began here four years ago, we could never have thought we could be standing here winning a series here for the first time in this country. I only have one word to say that I am proud, firstly as a part of the team and to lead these players, which is an honour. They make a captain look good. It has been outstanding to see and we definitely deserve to enjoy this moment. By far (his best moment), it has to be at the top of the pile. When we won the World Cup I was the youngest member of the side so I didn\u2019t really feel what they felt (when they were emotional) but realising what we have done here we have never done before we can really be proud of. I feel this win will give our side a different identity and can inspire a lot of kids to do the same. I want to give a special mention to Pujara. He has been outstanding in this series. He is always a guy who is willing to accept things and work on his game and he is the nicest guy around. And a special mention for Mayank Agarwal who came into the side and batted like a champion. <br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c32cb50e4b072dc52e69c34\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-07T03:48:27.181Z\">3.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Tim Paine speaks. </strong>(Again, roughly!):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You have to tip your hat to India. We know how hard it is to win overseas so congratulations to Virat and Ravi and their team, it is the first team they have ever done it (here) so well done to those guys. We had our chances to win the Test in Adelaide but India outplayed us in the big moment. In Perth, we played a pretty good game of cricket but in Melbourne and Sydney, we were outplayed in all departments so they deserved tow in the series. We have some talent in this team but also some talent outside the side, so we\u2019re going to learn a hell of a lot from that. Any games you can get into guys at international level where they can learn is positive even if at the moment it is probably hard for the guys to see. The message is to keep scoring runs and that\u2019s the currency in cricket. We know as a playing group here we have to get better and we have people outside the team putting on pressure and some guys not far from coming back. So form this gloom and doom we have some positives and a series coming up in a couple of weeks.

On his tour to England, during which he was awarded a medal after saving a boy from drowning in the Thames, he reportedly started a fire in the outfield during one match \u201cto keep warm\u201d. A chemist by profession, he was made bankrupt, but once discharged became a bookmaker, carrying a satchel embossed with \u201cConingham the Cricketer\u201d.</p> <p>But perhaps his most famous moments came in 1900 when he conducted his own (unsuccessful) defence in a divorce case when he accused the private secretary of Cardinal Moran, head of the Australian Catholic Church, of adultery with his wife. The trial and retrial enthralled the public, and although Coningham lost, the priest, Francis O\u2019Haran, was guilty. Coningham\u2019s wife subsequently admitted that the couple\u2019s third child was O\u2019Haran\u2019s. The couple emigrated to New Zealand where Coningham worked as a book salesman until being sentenced to six months in prison for fraudulent conversion. In 1912 his wife divorced him after he committed adultery in a beach shed. He returned to Australia and died in a mental institution. <br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c32c310e4b02fb91ff0f868\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-07T03:17:21.139Z\">3.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Match officials will be meeting with the ground staff at 2:30pm</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>That\u2019s 15 minutes from now.

I had osbcenely belaboured (and perhaps vituperatively praised) him for describing a batsman as \u2018coming over a bit Northern Bavaria circa 1934 there\u2019. Dan replied with quizzical patience. \u2018I\u2019m touched someone appreciated that.

I think it was Clem Hill who recalled Trumper used to hit them at the end of the over so as to retain the strike. Which was very clever.\u201d</p> <p>How is it possible that I never knew about the five/six thing? Thanks for this!

Hits over the fence counted five [in some countries / eras - ed.] So you have an innings from Trumper in grade cricket playing for Paddington at Redfern oval. He scores 335 in 165 minutes without a six... but he did hit 22 fives and 39 fours in adding 517 for the first wicket with teammate Dan Gee. Paddington\u2019s innings began at 2.25pm and ended before 6pm and it would have ended sooner but for interruptions while players and spectators searched for the six balls lost during the innings. They scored 618.</p> <p>\u201cThe famous Yabba described it thus: \u2018In one [six-ball] over, Trumper and Gee got three fives each. It was a case of one hit and one walk down the wicket. The uninitiated would have thought they were walking a single. If they had sixes in those days Trumper would have retained the strike and heaven knows what he would have scored. Nine fieldsmen on the boundary including slip with just bowler and keeper close to the wicket.\u2019<br></p> <p>\u201cUncovered wickets of course, and in a later innings for Paddo, Trumper whacked 189 not out with 15 fives and 22 fours. In successive scoring strokes he made 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, and later 4, 4, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5.<br><br>\u201cCould you pass this onto to our batsmen as inspiration. 2.15pm till just before 6, we could still romp this in!\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-07T01:51:39.827Z\">at 1.51am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c32a991e4b0cebe76181402\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-07T01:30:12.321Z\">1.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A couple of emails in on a related theme. From Nick Bron. \u201cSo much focus has been on the missing Australian batters, but not much has been said (correct me if I\u2019m wrong) about the fact that Australia\u2019s bowling attack, much vaunted in the lead up as the best in the world, have been unable to bowl India out for three innings in a row.\u201d</p> <p>And from Nick Banks, headed \u201cOscillating not so wildly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBeen thinking some more about the apparent lack of reverse swing found by the big Aussie quicks in this series. Adopting a Columbo-style stance and voice, here goes.</p> <p>\u201cHow is it that Australia\u2019s supposedly \u2018best bowling attack in the world\u2019 has been so blunt and lifeless while India\u2019s has found prodigious swing in each test? Could it be anything to do with South Africa? Has there been any data analysis done on how much reverse these bowlers found pre and post SA? Or is this all far too unseemly to even suggest? (I still don\u2019t buy that a professional fast bowler wouldn\u2019t be able to tell that something had been done to the ball).</p> <p>\u201cIt seems the share of criticism has been unfairly weighted to the batsmen. Yes they\u2019ve been woeful, but so were England\u2019s in good measure back in the English summer even while dismantling this supposedly world-beating Indian team. Principally that was because of some quality bowling in friendly conditions. Could a similar bowling display by Aus this series have produced a similar result?\u201d</p> <p>A bit to unpack here. The best in the world thing is deeply parochial. South Africa - Steyn, Rabada, Philander. England - Broad, Anderson, Woakes, Curran, Stokes. India in this series, as they\u2019ve showed. Even the Windies now have Holder and Gabriel firing. Pakistan - Mo Abbas, Hasan Ali, Mohammad Amir. There are some pretty good attacks going around, and 2018 was the best bowling year in decades.</p> <p>I would argue that it\u2019s easier for a bowling attack to dominate in English conditions than on fairly flat Australian decks, especially like those in Sydney and Melbourne. In Adelaide, Australia\u2019s bowlers did the job and the batsmen failed them. In Perth, the bowlers did the job and Australia won. And on the lifeless pitches, they\u2019ve struggled. You could put that down to exhaustion or lack of quality depending on your perspective.</p> <p>As for reverse swing though, I\u2019ve commissioned some data from CricViz (they\u2019re sitting two seats to my left) and they say that India\u2019s bowlers after the 40th over have not swung the ball much more than Australia\u2019s. Very marginal. India have swung the new ball a bit more. That could have various facets too. Swing doesn\u2019t mean much if it\u2019s swinging a metre down leg side. And swing might not get good batsmen out, while it might get struggling batsmen out. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c32a89ee4b0cebe761813fe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-07T01:19:45.139Z\">1.19am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Jay Rose is taking an analytical approach. \u201cAre there any stats on post-GOAT teams and relative performance? Do national teams reliably go into a period of decline after X years of domination, with a higher than average loss/win? Or do they go from a high win rate to an average win rate and the rest is myth?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019d even be possible. Where do you draw the post-GOAT line? 50 per cent of the long-term players in a team have retired? In my cricket-watching time, I\u2019ve seen the West Indies and Australia peak and fall demonstrably, but two is hardly a reliable N.\u201d</p> <p>I think you\u2019d track it with a combination of win-loss, batting averages, bowling averages, strike rates, etc, over a period of time.

In the history of Test cricket all countries have had their ups and downs and the beauty of it is, is that they don\u2019t coincide. So right now India are brilliant and the Aussies are struggling. Roll on ten years and the picture may well be different. Or, as Plato put it better than me when he and his fellow philosophers were constructing the cradle of civilisation that was Ancient Greece: \u2018Some days you\u2019re the statue, and some days you\u2019re the pigeon.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Or as I similarly wrote in a poem not quite so long ago, \u201cSome days you\u2019re bowling, and some days you\u2019re batting / and some days you\u2019re Warnie, and some days you\u2019re Gatting.\u201d<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c32a010e4b02fb91ff0f7c0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-07T00:42:03.032Z\">12.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Lots of philosophy coming in about the state of Australian cricket, which is very nice to see. \u201cLate 88, I recall coming home from school and being horrified at the performance of the Australian team that summer vs the Windies,\u201d writes Daniel Guidone. \u201cAt the time, I wasn\u2019t across what the problem was. I\u2019ve looked at the scorecards, and like this series, the selectors seemed unsure of their best team, and were searching for answers in a home series against the greatest team of the time. Back then, the bowling attack in particular seemed unsettled. I was too young to understand if there was the same head-shaking about a selection policy that saw Tony Dodemaide and Chris Matthews picked for the first test, but I\u2019m sure some questions were asked.</p> <p>\u201cSo maybe these things just go around in cycles? After that sad summer 30 years ago, Australia went to England and was able to find a winning identity, and a winning team to build on. On that tour, the uncertainty disappeared as bowlers like Hughes and batsmen like Taylor finally developed into world-class players. I don\u2019t know if history will repeat itself this year specifically, but Paine is doing his part in developing a team identity, and I\u2019m sure soon one of the young batsmen will find their feet and things will turn around.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c329f7be4b072dc52e69b67\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-07T00:39:14.511Z\">12.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ray Murphy emails in. \u201cWhile the Keith Miller Messerschmitt quote is one that is well known to cricket nuffies, so doesn\u2019t qualify as obscure, still shows what an extraordinary bloke he was \u2013 not to mention being extraordinarily socially dapper.

Theoretically possible, if time travellers brought together one of those Greatest XIs of All Time, but let\u2019s call it improbable for now.</p> <p>Australia followed on yesterday, they\u2019re no wicket for 6 runs today, and they\u2019ll start in about 45 minutes\u2019 time. <br></p> </div>   </div>",

We\u2019ve had a great time bringing it to you. We\u2019ll see you again for the ODIs next week. Bye for now from the SCG. Kohli (more) The way the bowlers have dictated terms and dominated in the series is something I have never seen happy in Indian cricket before, especially with just four bowlers, so hats off to them the way they prepared themselves and fitness levels and mindset. They don\u2019t look at a pitch and say there is nothing for us, they look at ways to take wickets and they dictate plans for me. it is a revelation for Indian cricket and learning for all the bowlers back home to get into that mindset early in their career. They are going to be looked up to for a long, long time at hoe. This is just a stepping stone for us. It is a young side. The most important thing for us is belief. Now we have the results to back that belief. It is just the stepping stone for greater things in the future. Virat Kohli speaks. Firstly, I want to say I have never been more proud to be part of a team than this one right here. I think the culture we have been able to build over the last twelve months, the transition began here four years ago, we could never have thought we could be standing here winning a series here for the first time in this country. I only have one word to say that I am proud, firstly as a part of the team and to lead these players, which is an honour. They make a captain look good. It has been outstanding to see and we definitely deserve to enjoy this moment. By far (his best moment), it has to be at the top of the pile. When we won the World Cup I was the youngest member of the side so I didn\u2019t really feel what they felt (when they were emotional) but realising what we have done here we have never done before we can really be proud of. I feel this win will give our side a different identity and can inspire a lot of kids to do the same. I want to give a special mention to Pujara. He has been outstanding in this series. He is always a guy who is willing to accept things and work on his game and he is the nicest guy around. And a special mention for Mayank Agarwal who came into the side and batted like a champion. Tim Paine speaks. (Again, roughly!): You have to tip your hat to India. We know how hard it is to win overseas so congratulations to Virat and Ravi and their team, it is the first team they have ever done it (here) so well done to those guys. We had our chances to win the Test in Adelaide but India outplayed us in the big moment. In Perth, we played a pretty good game of cricket but in Melbourne and Sydney, we were outplayed in all departments so they deserved tow in the series. We have some talent in this team but also some talent outside the side, so we\u2019re going to learn a hell of a lot from that. Any games you can get into guys at international level where they can learn is positive even if at the moment it is probably hard for the guys to see. The message is to keep scoring runs and that\u2019s the currency in cricket. We know as a playing group here we have to get better and we have people outside the team putting on pressure and some guys not far from coming back. So form this gloom and doom we have some positives and a series coming up in a couple of weeks. We know cricket is a funny game and it can turn quickly. Cheteshwar Pujara is player of the match and series. And said (roughly!): It is a great feeling for all of us. We have been working really hard to win a series in this country. It has never been easy so we are really proud of the team and the way I have contributed. For me, the first hundred was special in Adelaide going one-nil up was something we were all aiming for so it was really special. As a batsman, you need to get used to pace and bounce and (playing around the world) has helped. I was very well prepared. This is definitely the best Indian team I\u2019ve been part of. We have been playing with four bowlers and it\u2019s never easy to do that and take 20 wickets so all credit goes to them. They\u2019ve been remarkable. It has taken 71 years for India to win here. This is a wonderful triumph for Kohli\u2019s men. The teams are shaking hands and then we\u2019ll have the presentation. Stick with the OBO for comments from the captains and man of the match. Sorry that I won\u2019t be able to get to any more emails but thanks for your notes throughout the day. Back shortly with words from Kohli, Paine and Pujara as India lift the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The game has been officially called off and the Indians are all smiles, the small group of fans out the front of the rooms going wild in response. Fantastic stuff. The word from the broadcasters is that the game will be called off. That is not confirmed, but is firming as the most likely outcome of the meeting five minutes from now. An email from Geoff\u2019s dad! Andrew Lemon is a renowned historian, so I\u2019m not surprised that he has a nugget for us on his son\u2019s earlier topic. \u201cPress report from July 1893: \u2018During an excursion made by the Australian cricketers up the Thames, a boatman fell overboard and was rescued by Coningham, the Australian cricketer, who had a narrow escape from drowning.\u2019 Let\u2019s give it up for Arthur Coningham! This is an extract from his Cricinfo profile: But he was undoubtedly one of the game\u2019s more colourful figures and was once described as having \u201cthe audacity and cunning of an ape and the modesty of a phallic symbol.\u201d His sole Test was memorable as he was no-balled, and in anger he deliberately hurled the next ball at AE Stoddart, England\u2019s captain. On his tour to England, during which he was awarded a medal after saving a boy from drowning in the Thames, he reportedly started a fire in the outfield during one match \u201cto keep warm\u201d. A chemist by profession, he was made bankrupt, but once discharged became a bookmaker, carrying a satchel embossed with \u201cConingham the Cricketer\u201d. But perhaps his most famous moments came in 1900 when he conducted his own (unsuccessful) defence in a divorce case when he accused the private secretary of Cardinal Moran, head of the Australian Catholic Church, of adultery with his wife. The trial and retrial enthralled the public, and although Coningham lost, the priest, Francis O\u2019Haran, was guilty. Coningham\u2019s wife subsequently admitted that the couple\u2019s third child was O\u2019Haran\u2019s. The couple emigrated to New Zealand where Coningham worked as a book salesman until being sentenced to six months in prison for fraudulent conversion. In 1912 his wife divorced him after he committed adultery in a beach shed. He returned to Australia and died in a mental institution. That\u2019s 15 minutes from now. Given the rain is so soft, I don\u2019t reckon they will be in a position to call it off, as it would only take an hour to get back on. And I don\u2019t believe the skippers are permitted to shake hands until 4:30pm. Interesting. We\u2019ll see. Anyway, back to our conversations for now... \u201cLovely shout out to Dan Lucas there,\u201d begins Robert McLiam Wilson, the OBO\u2019s mighty Paris correspondent. \u201cRunning with your email cue, I just looked back at several dinks, smashes and lobs he sent over my virtual net, including this from the long-lost pre-Trump days of 2016. I had osbcenely belaboured (and perhaps vituperatively praised) him for describing a batsman as \u2018coming over a bit Northern Bavaria circa 1934 there\u2019. Dan replied with quizzical patience. \u2018I\u2019m touched someone appreciated that. Sometimes, I get the feeling I\u2019m a couple of rehashed Simpsons jokes and a rain-affected draw away from real spiritual breakthrough.\u2019 Epic comedy stylings.\u201d He was so bloody smart. And I\u2019m glad this email included a bit of his Simpsons\u2019 fandom. Back on our previous topic with Geoff. \u201cI am not sure if Lee Henderson is still online,\u201d says Gervase Greene, \u201cbut the other interesting aspect of that Trumper knock was that back then when you hit a Five (what we\u2019d now call a 6) you had to change ends. I think it was Clem Hill who recalled Trumper used to hit them at the end of the over so as to retain the strike. Which was very clever.\u201d How is it possible that I never knew about the five/six thing? Thanks for this! Speaking of early internet days in our newer topic (crude segue), the place where I first found likeminded cricket nerds on the net was called the Victor Trumper Cricket Board. Are there any old VTCB alumni reading on here today? There\u2019s usually one or two of you. \u201cRain is good and bad,\u201d emails Mahendra Killedar. \u201cIt saves this game but also means centuryless series for the Aussies!!\u201d In relation to the underperforming Australian batting line-up, I can report some news from the ground: the squad for the two Sri Lanka Tests will be named on Wednesday with Justin Langer answering questions from the media after the announcement. \u201cI am going to Vietnam in a few days,\u201d says David Blackah. \u201cIf I am asked about sport in Australia I will say well, there is this game we play where all the players sit in a shed all day looking out the window at non-existent rain.\u201d Yes, this might be the first time today that a brolly is actually required out there. I can understand why punters and pundits alike have been fairly frustrated, especially about the bad light situation yesterday. I spent most of last night arguing for a new way to deal with this problem, which includes the pink ball. Have a read and see what you think. Strangely, for something a touch left-field, I\u2019m getting a fairly positive response. This is my all-time favourite Ric Finlay factoid, which he gives a run every year. Remember that the SCG Trust have been campaigning for a second Test a summer at this ground, at the expense of one of the smaller Australian cities. Nup. \u201cMy first ever email address was marlon_samuels@hotmail.com,\u201d emails Barnaby Lever, \u201cafter I saw him make a 50 on debut at the MCG and being a massive West Indies fan, mistakenly took for a resurgence in their fortunes. In the age of MSN messenger I used to get lots of friend requests and chats from the Caribbean who were always disappointed it was a 15 year old from Newy rather than their hero.\u201d This is outstanding. Just adopting the name - why not? One of the great regrets of my life relates to Marlon. On my first overseas tour covering the team in 2015, Marlon was in the Windies XI in Dominica. Sure enough, he was friendly and very chatty throughout the week. After the Test, he invited me and another colleague to his house in Jamaica for a party he was holding three days before the Second Test. Well, in short, we didn\u2019t. Logistics, work and all the rest. Why does it hurt not having gone? Well, Marlon missed Jamaica Test with what was reported as a bout of conjunctivitis. Or so we were told. But I found out later, via the team doctor (one of our callers on radio that week) it was due to how written off he was... after his party. Sigh! It is raining harder at the SCG now. On SEN, they say the radar might clear in an hour or so, but I doubt it. To kill five minutes, I had a pop at this yesterday and, contrary to what Tom suggested, nailed 9/12 rather than running the table. Have a go. Don\u2019t cheat. \u201cGreat by the whole OBO team the last few days.\u201d I probably didn\u2019t need to include that first line from Scott Jacobs, but here we are. \u201cMy first email was related to an obsession with Team America just after finishing high school. Myself and a friend or two had seen the movie and then went away rock climbing for nearly a month. That month was filled by constant and unending repetition of calling out quotes from the movie to each other, echoing around the rock faces and gullies of Mt Arapiles in the Wimmera. If any of your readers were there, they may have heard a teenager calling from the top of a cliff \u2018Get out of the alley you f*@!ing bum!\u2019 ringing around the gumtrees.\u201d Not quite Garden State, but you\u2019ve got me hooked. Please continue. \u201cShortly after getting home, I made my first email: getoutofthealley@etc. (I decided that I should keep the swears out of the email, given I would be using it for job applications - without really connecting that I wouldn\u2019t want that email on job applications as a grown man). We also then went to the movies to see Team America again - and realised we\u2019d been misquoting it the whole time as the actual line was \u2018Get out of the street you...\u2019. Ah well. It\u2019s the thought that counts.\u201d What a twist! Your first email is a Hold Me Closer, Tony Danza. Thanks or sharing. Meanwhile... Advance Australia Fair. Speaking of the OBOing the rain. Whenever this happens, I think of the late and wonderful Dan Lucas. The first time that I went into Guardian HQ to OBO the cricket, instead of doing it at the ground, he was on deck with me and we had a lovely old time. One of his little tricks was to go through all of the TV stations available on the internal directory and OBO about a minute of each when the rain came. On this occasion, it included soaps, panel shows, snooker, advertorials, parliament - the works. There was nothing that man could not find humour in. We sure do miss him in these parts. Hello world. I\u2019m afraid the status update from the press box at the SCG is much as it was: mizzle... persistent mizzle. Plenty of people are on the ground looking around and none of them have umbrellas, but while this persists, the status quo will prevail. Thanks to Geoffers for a predictably entertaining rain OBO. That\u2019s the third of those he has steered over the last two Tests, and as he says himself, it\u2019s where he does his finest work. Stick with me over the next couple of hours and we\u2019ll make our own fun, yeah? To begin, the formalities. We can email and we and tweet. I will give you my phone number if you want. My first email address related to the fact that I ran an Anna Kournikova fan site when I was a mid-teen. Have that too, if you ask nicely. In fact, why don\u2019t we start there? This is always good at parties (read, nightclub balconies). What was your first email address? If you from the Gen Y side of the divide, I\u2019m tipping it was an absolute shocker. Did it have a cricket bent? Many of my passwords still include \u201c139\u201d as a consequence of Mark Waugh\u2019s debut. Reveal all to me. The covers are still on. It doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s raining, but this rain is so fine that who even knows any more. But I have a lovely session with you all \u2013 so many interesting emails, so many discussion points, and everyone has been polite and curious and engaged. What a delight. That\u2019s it for me this series, but hopefully you\u2019ll join us again when Australia play Sri Lanka in the upcoming Tests, plus a couple of India ODIs. It\u2019s always more fun when you lot get involved. Adam Collins will be in next, and we\u2019ll be writing and podcasting after the Test as well, as always. In the meantime, I\u2019ll leave you with this excellently random missive from Lee Henderson. \u201cUp until 1910 the laws of cricket said that a ball had to go right out of the ground to count for six. Hits over the fence counted five [in some countries / eras - ed.] So you have an innings from Trumper in grade cricket playing for Paddington at Redfern oval. He scores 335 in 165 minutes without a six... but he did hit 22 fives and 39 fours in adding 517 for the first wicket with teammate Dan Gee. Paddington\u2019s innings began at 2.25pm and ended before 6pm and it would have ended sooner but for interruptions while players and spectators searched for the six balls lost during the innings. They scored 618. \u201cThe famous Yabba described it thus: \u2018In one [six-ball] over, Trumper and Gee got three fives each. It was a case of one hit and one walk down the wicket. The uninitiated would have thought they were walking a single. If they had sixes in those days Trumper would have retained the strike and heaven knows what he would have scored. Nine fieldsmen on the boundary including slip with just bowler and keeper close to the wicket.\u2019 \u201cUncovered wickets of course, and in a later innings for Paddo, Trumper whacked 189 not out with 15 fives and 22 fours. In successive scoring strokes he made 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, and later 4, 4, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5. \u201cCould you pass this onto to our batsmen as inspiration. 2.15pm till just before 6, we could still romp this in!\u201d A couple of emails in on a related theme. From Nick Bron. \u201cSo much focus has been on the missing Australian batters, but not much has been said (correct me if I\u2019m wrong) about the fact that Australia\u2019s bowling attack, much vaunted in the lead up as the best in the world, have been unable to bowl India out for three innings in a row.\u201d And from Nick Banks, headed \u201cOscillating not so wildly.\u201d \u201cBeen thinking some more about the apparent lack of reverse swing found by the big Aussie quicks in this series. Adopting a Columbo-style stance and voice, here goes. \u201cHow is it that Australia\u2019s supposedly \u2018best bowling attack in the world\u2019 has been so blunt and lifeless while India\u2019s has found prodigious swing in each test? Could it be anything to do with South Africa? Has there been any data analysis done on how much reverse these bowlers found pre and post SA? Or is this all far too unseemly to even suggest? (I still don\u2019t buy that a professional fast bowler wouldn\u2019t be able to tell that something had been done to the ball). \u201cIt seems the share of criticism has been unfairly weighted to the batsmen. Yes they\u2019ve been woeful, but so were England\u2019s in good measure back in the English summer even while dismantling this supposedly world-beating Indian team. Principally that was because of some quality bowling in friendly conditions. Could a similar bowling display by Aus this series have produced a similar result?\u201d A bit to unpack here. The best in the world thing is deeply parochial. South Africa - Steyn, Rabada, Philander. England - Broad, Anderson, Woakes, Curran, Stokes. India in this series, as they\u2019ve showed. Even the Windies now have Holder and Gabriel firing. Pakistan - Mo Abbas, Hasan Ali, Mohammad Amir. There are some pretty good attacks going around, and 2018 was the best bowling year in decades. I would argue that it\u2019s easier for a bowling attack to dominate in English conditions than on fairly flat Australian decks, especially like those in Sydney and Melbourne. In Adelaide, Australia\u2019s bowlers did the job and the batsmen failed them. In Perth, the bowlers did the job and Australia won. And on the lifeless pitches, they\u2019ve struggled. You could put that down to exhaustion or lack of quality depending on your perspective. As for reverse swing though, I\u2019ve commissioned some data from CricViz (they\u2019re sitting two seats to my left) and they say that India\u2019s bowlers after the 40th over have not swung the ball much more than Australia\u2019s. Very marginal. India have swung the new ball a bit more. That could have various facets too. Swing doesn\u2019t mean much if it\u2019s swinging a metre down leg side. And swing might not get good batsmen out, while it might get struggling batsmen out. Jay Rose is taking an analytical approach. \u201cAre there any stats on post-GOAT teams and relative performance? Do national teams reliably go into a period of decline after X years of domination, with a higher than average loss/win? Or do they go from a high win rate to an average win rate and the rest is myth? \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019d even be possible. Where do you draw the post-GOAT line? 50 per cent of the long-term players in a team have retired? In my cricket-watching time, I\u2019ve seen the West Indies and Australia peak and fall demonstrably, but two is hardly a reliable N.\u201d I think you\u2019d track it with a combination of win-loss, batting averages, bowling averages, strike rates, etc, over a period of time. Then contrast those with subsequent eras. Like it\u2019s notable that Australian in 2018 had the worst team-wide batting average per wicket since 1978. Now this is remarkable, from Jonny Sultoon. \u201cOverlooked stat in all the Bumrah love-in. He\u2019s slowly moving to the top of this list \u2013 a genuine chance of sitting pretty among other giants of the game.\u201d The list, folks, is for the worst batting average of all time. Currently Jasprit is leading all comers with a mark of 1.55. But he\u2019s only played 15 innings, so he needs 20 to get to the cut-off for most batting statistics. Pommie Mbangwa with 2.00 and Jack Saunders with 2.29 lead the People\u2019s Champion Chris Martin with 2.36 from 104 knocks. I was doing some research on what percentage of Shaun Marsh\u2019s dismissals were in single figures, and I discovered that Martin\u2019s career rate was 100%. He made double figures once, for 12 not out, from memory with at least two edges through the cordon. Impressive that he actually got as high as 2.36 to be honest. The many innings of 1 not out probably helped, as his batting partner panicked and found deep midwicket. \u201cThe fact is Australians are no longer the outdoor, athletic bunch of people they were. Property prices have resulted in units or small backyards, kids don\u2019t play as much, sticking to video games and phones. The quality of Australian athletes will only continue to diminish.\u201d Email from Darius Rana. It\u2019s a popular contention, of the sort you often hear being treated as self-evident. Like the idea that T20 cricket has ruined Test batsmen. It\u2019s easy to assert but isn\u2019t necessarily supported empirically. Like I\u2019m not sure how athletic people were when they were malnourished during the Depression, or on rations during WWII. The fact other nations have caught up to Australia in sports funding, where previously we were an outlier in that regard, is another influence to be considered. \u201cI completely agree with Nicholas Booth,\u201d writes Mark Pickering. \u201cIn an age where aggressive bullies are being shamed in all aspects of life, for the past 10 years Aussie cricket has looked like an anachronism and a sport that is going to lose out in recruiting vs other sports. Moving from England to WA and playing club cricket in the 90s I was shocked at the overly aggressive sledging and bullying that went on in a relatively friendly match and I\u2019m no shrinking violet. Probably why I\u2019m now playing cricket in New Zealand!\u201d The game here certainly has been out of step as other aspects of life clamp down on bullying. Which isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s not still rife, but there\u2019s movement in the right direction. Certain heads of state aside. Here\u2019s Robert Wilson. \u201cThough there\u2019s not a whisper of Test cricket about him, Samuel Beckett has got to get a shout as an interesting cricketer. A jug-eared geek when young, movie-star handsome when old, the bold Samuel managed to parlay once waiting a vexingly long time at a bus-stop in the Vaucluse and a vocabulary consisting of the words not, never, nowhere and nothing into an actual Nobel Prize. The first class average of 8.75 and zero zilch of his zip wickets explains, I think, quite a lot. No wonder he felt a touch glum.\u201d If you think this is whimsy, Slammin\u2019 Sam Beckett did in fact play two first-class games for Dublin University. If he\u2019d ever made a good score he could have been Dublin his average as well. And no, he never did take a wicket. Those 138 lonely deliveries sent down for nothing. I can\u2019t even tell if it\u2019s raining any more. The covers are still down. I\u2019m enjoying this non-session, though, with all your correspondence. Speaking of speaking to you all: if you\u2019re an OBO reader in Melbourne, Adam Collins and I are doing a live version of our cricket podcast The Final Word next week. Thursday Jan 17th at the Commercial Club pub in Fitzroy. It\u2019s a small venue, so you can book seats here. Here\u2019s Olly. \u201cAlthough I imagine the average age of us OBOers is probably above 40, such is the immediacy of modern times with access to online services and instant knowledge gratification I think we only remember the good times. In the history of Test cricket all countries have had their ups and downs and the beauty of it is, is that they don\u2019t coincide. So right now India are brilliant and the Aussies are struggling. Roll on ten years and the picture may well be different. Or, as Plato put it better than me when he and his fellow philosophers were constructing the cradle of civilisation that was Ancient Greece: \u2018Some days you\u2019re the statue, and some days you\u2019re the pigeon.\u2019\u201d Or as I similarly wrote in a poem not quite so long ago, \u201cSome days you\u2019re bowling, and some days you\u2019re batting / and some days you\u2019re Warnie, and some days you\u2019re Gatting.\u201d Lots of philosophy coming in about the state of Australian cricket, which is very nice to see. \u201cLate 88, I recall coming home from school and being horrified at the performance of the Australian team that summer vs the Windies,\u201d writes Daniel Guidone. \u201cAt the time, I wasn\u2019t across what the problem was. I\u2019ve looked at the scorecards, and like this series, the selectors seemed unsure of their best team, and were searching for answers in a home series against the greatest team of the time. Back then, the bowling attack in particular seemed unsettled. I was too young to understand if there was the same head-shaking about a selection policy that saw Tony Dodemaide and Chris Matthews picked for the first test, but I\u2019m sure some questions were asked. \u201cSo maybe these things just go around in cycles? After that sad summer 30 years ago, Australia went to England and was able to find a winning identity, and a winning team to build on. On that tour, the uncertainty disappeared as bowlers like Hughes and batsmen like Taylor finally developed into world-class players. I don\u2019t know if history will repeat itself this year specifically, but Paine is doing his part in developing a team identity, and I\u2019m sure soon one of the young batsmen will find their feet and things will turn around.\u201d Ray Murphy emails in. \u201cWhile the Keith Miller Messerschmitt quote is one that is well known to cricket nuffies, so doesn\u2019t qualify as obscure, still shows what an extraordinary bloke he was \u2013 not to mention being extraordinarily socially dapper. Cricket\u2019s just a game, an absolutely beautiful and life enhancing one to play and follow, but just a game after all. Should be remembered when the Chicken Littles lament the state of the Australian game, players and/or skills when we aren\u2019t bullying and dominating the opposition. Sometimes you just play and get beaten by a better team. Well done to India for superb batting and bowling this summer, and well done to Tim Paine\u2019s team for playing the beautiful game of cricket.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t say I agree with Shane George\u2019s thesis - kids always want to emulate successful teams. The All Blacks never seem to run out of fresh young talent,\u201d emails Bob Biddulph. \u201cAs for intriguing former cricketers, I always thought Bill Johnston was a man who never received the plaudits he deserved: grew up on a struggling dairy farm (you may guess my occupation as similar and you may be right), became an Invincible, bowling left-arm fast behind Lindwall and Miller, then would revert to left-arm tweak when the ball was old. Averaged 100 with the bat on an Ashes tour thanks to not outs, and won a Test against the West Indies with an improbable last wicket stand of 30-odd. Would be a handy addition to the current side.\u201d \u201cCan I nominate Jack Iverson as a truly remarkable cricketer, and subject of the brilliant book Mystery Spinner, by the peerless Gideon Haigh,\u201d writes Brian Withington. \u201cThe book was recommended to me by one of the OBO brotherhood (Rob Smyth or Adam Collins I think) and it\u2019s a masterly tale of an enigmatic riddle of a man who emerged from obscurity in his early 30s to rapidly achieve national acclaim via a Melbourne club 3rd team, and then at the peak of his amazing powers retired from international cricket and soon faded from view. Apparently Iverson developed his baffling repertoire of leg breaks, googlies and top spinners practicing with a table tennis ball in Papua New Guinea during WW2. Great read.\u201d Table tennis. Responsible for so many twists on the tortured roads of fortune. \u201cThe world of cricket needs a bloodthirsty, arrogant, talented, brutal Oz team,\u201d writes Fantie from London. \u201cSpanking that team is much better than this one which seems more like a squeaky clean accountant. We need a feral thug on speed.\u201d Yes, but then we have to put up with them over here all the rest of the time when they\u2019re not playing your lot. Rather not, thanks. Covers update: still on. The forecast is for \u201clight drizzle at times.\u201d So far those times have not been a-changing. Also the Bureau has recorded 0.0 millimetres of rain today, which is another occurrence supporting the theory of the last couple of years that we\u2019re all in the Matrix and it\u2019s glitching. Jack Faine has a Fascination Vote: \u201cWhilst he is not in the same heroic echelon as the war heroes, Ric Charlesworth AO is a remarkable cricketer. He opened the batting for WA for five or six years, played hockey in five Olympics captaining twice, coached the men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey teams to world dominance. A genuine giant. I believe he also had ten years or so as a member of WA Parliament. Not quite sure how he found the time for any of it. Oh yes, Wikipedia has just reminded me that he also completed a medical degree at UWA. Ho hum.\u201d Nicholas Booth has the first response to Shane. \u201cIt could that parents steered their kids towards other sports due to the struggles of the likes of Hayden, Langer, MacGill etc, but I think it\u2019s more likely that the perception of the team as boorish bad winners did way more damage.\u201d Imagine that. I\u2019ve condensed a fairly lengthy Twitter thesis posed to me by Shane George. Not necessarily one I agree with but an interesting contention that I haven\u2019t heard anyone argue before. Go on? \u201cMy contention is that the current uncompetitive Australia team is directly attributable to the excellence of their forebears for 20 years. The children of that era will have watched players like Stuart Law, Blewett, Love, Lehmann sit out. Langer and Hayden had a long time out and were forced to change styles, Martyn had to concede he was never going to be Mark Waugh. Gillespie &amp; MacGill would have been all-time greats in other teams. The kids will have seen the struggles of these excellent players to squeeze into 11 spots and determined that there were more rewarding athletic pursuits. Awesome teams are an active discouragement to children.\u201d Unique. Thoughts, anyone? \u201cHello,\u201d writes John Larmett. \u201cAfter observing all summer, and having time spent in the UK, I hope Australia stick to their new policies and don\u2019t revert to earlier ways. A brand new world awaits. It always was going to be a bit painful, but this country has got a massive part to play in Test cricket worldwide. Just be patient.\u201d It\u2019s 10:50am local time. The main covers are still down. There\u2019s still very light misting precipitation floating around like Bonnie Tyler\u2019s dress. John Goldstein has nominated Hedley Verity as his fascinating cricketer. Aside from taking a million first-class wickets and getting Bradman out in Tests more often than anyone, and being Jardine\u2019s right-hand man during Bodyline, Verity then joined up during WWII, got posted to India and the Middle East, then got hit by shrapnel and captured by the Germans during the invasion of Sicily. He died in a hospital in Italy in 1943. Tibby Cotter is the next nomination, via Mark McGrath. \u201cSlinging fast bowler from early last century. Took 89 test wickets at 28.64. Was the premier fast bowler of his time in Australia taking 442 first class wickets at 24.27. Participated in what was effectively a players\u2019 strike against the Australian Cricket Board of Control in 1912 and never played for Australia again. Joined the AIF in 1915 at the age of 31. Killed in the light horse charge at Bersheeba in 1917.\u201d Industrial action? Against a recalcitrant board? Thank goodness those days of mismanagement are a century behind us. \u201cIn answer to Andrew Benton\u2019s question about extraordinary cricketers, may I offer up CB Fry,\u201d writes Olly. \u201cHe played 26 Tests for England, played for Southampton in an FA Cup Final, won Blues for athletics at Oxford and turned down the chance of becoming the King of Albania. But he\u2019s probably best remembered for his party trick of jumping backwards, from a standing position, onto a mantelpiece. Keep up the good work.\u201d I guess that\u2019s one way to do the dusting. Nick Jones has a novel solution for Australia. \u201cWas thinking intra game substitutable squad members (including staff) might be a great idea. Out go Usman and Marsh. G Hick to open up followed by Langer at No3 today.\u201d I reckon they\u2019ll rely on the rain in the first instance. Which is still drizzling. Gareth Frith starts out as a global citizen and ends up as a partisan, a striking transition. \u201cWe\u2019re down to the final day of the final test of a thoroughly absorbing series, one of those you\u2019re a bit sad to see the back of. It\u2019s played havoc with my sleeping pattern but it\u2019s been worth it. For a neutral with no dog in the fight, it\u2019s been gripping viewing, and also shows how fortunate and/or skilful England were in key moments last year. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure reading you and the Guardian OBO team, still the best cricket section on the whole bloody mastiff interweb. Some words on how Joe Burns and Glenn Maxwell may as well just concentrate on their Red Rose contracts and Cricket Australia would be better off looking elsewhere in the post mortem would be most appreciated.\u201d Thanks from me and all the others. There wouldn\u2019t be much of an OBO without the readers. There has to be something pleasant and friendly in the wilds of the internet, doesn\u2019t there? I only wish I could be describing some cricket for you, rather than describing weather. God bless Andrew Benton. \u201cHave any Test cricketers been kidnapped and held to ransom? Saved a sinking ship, stopped a runaway train, or rescued a drowning maiden? Or do they lead and have they led rather pedestrian lives in this regard? There must be some amazing facts out there. You wouldn\u2019t believe it! Oh yes I would! And I do say it\u2019ll be a draw, I do. I still do.\u201d I\u2019m reading that paragraph in a kind of breathless Vivian Leigh voice, I don\u2019t know about you. Andrew did indeed predict the draw on the first day and I told him he was a fool, a damned fool. But from memory I did add the caveat that only the weather could create one. And here we are, perhaps (cue poor mental arithmetic) 68 overs lost and counting. The big covers are coming down now. If anyone can answer Andrew\u2019s questions about exceptional lives, do so. There were plenty of cricketers who served in the World Wars and returned from daring exploits, it must be said. Any other great stories? Send them in. Tell you what, I don\u2019t know why they even bother playing cricket in Australia, rah rah rah. The West Indies Test here a couple of years ago could better have been called the Wet Sydneys Test \u2013 the middle three days were washed out. God knows how we filled hours of airtime and metres of column space in that day and age. The rain is light but persistent. The big covers aren\u2019t down, just the pitch cover. Play will \u2013 again \u2013 be delayed. We will not start at 10am local time. Because there\u2019s drizzle and seven minutes to go. Arooooooo. Ed Cowan on the radio is firing a few good shots at the pitch. He\u2019s saying don\u2019t let the curators get away with having prepared a road, just because Australia\u2019s poor batting means the result is possible, and just because rain will be a factor if there\u2019s a draw. Brad Haddin is speaking with the ABC about the light policy yesterday, too. \u201cI\u2019m with you, and I think I\u2019m with the crowd as well. From a cricket spectator point of view, I don\u2019t think it was dangerous for the players.\u201d Fair suggestion. You\u2019d get a lot more run-outs from balls kicked onto the stumps. I regret to inform you that there is definitely a bit of drizzle around the northern inner suburbs, my sources say. Brad Stafford is also spotting enemy action from the crow\u2019s nest. \u201cHi Geoff, really odd that the lights aren\u2019t on yet \u2013 supposed to start in 25 minutes (although from my 43rd storey CBD window it looks very much like it did yesterday). \u201cSpeaking of which, I was there yesterday, and it seemed pretty poor form from the umpires to not get players out there earlier in the day. There\u2019s no way players would go off in that level of intermittent drizzle, so why not start play in it?\u201d I largely tend to agree. Light and rain are the two things that cruel cricket the most as a sport (aside from match-fixing and sandpaper stories and all the rest). To a degree, waiting around at a cricket ground for play to start is just part of the deal. But if we dig a bit deeper, should it be? Not to say they should play in thunderstorms, but surely we could be a bit more dynamic and trade a few millimetres of principle to get more action on the field? As always, tweet me your thoughts at @GeoffLemonSport, or email me at geoff.lemon@theguardian.com. Good morrow. Today, the cricket equation is simple. Australia must bat a full innings for a full day to avoid defeat. India must take 10 wickets to win a match. The sky is cloudy but no rain is falling. And that is that. Easier said than done, in a season where Australia has been incapable of batting long periods of time. And on a final day pitch which is holding up well but still has a few signs of wear and some bounce keeping low. Of course, this result won\u2019t affect the series result, because India already lead 1-2. So win or draw today, they\u2019ll still win the series. The only way Australia could win this match and level the series would be to pile on perhaps 400 runs in two sessions, then pop India back in and rissole them within 30 overs. Theoretically possible, if time travellers brought together one of those Greatest XIs of All Time, but let\u2019s call it improbable for now. Australia followed on yesterday, they\u2019re no wicket for 6 runs today, and they\u2019ll start in about 45 minutes\u2019 time.",

Among others, Alan Sunderland, an editorial director at ABC News, has called for more cautious descriptions of what happened last Saturday in St Kilda. There, around 150 far-right thugs and a sitting Australian senator gathered for an inchoate protest against a fiction: that \u201cAfrican gangs\u201d present an existential threat to Melbourne. Sunderland tweeted that the far-right group, who even took the trouble to throw Roman salutes, should not be called Nazis because they lack the necessary \u201cformality and consistency of belief\u201d. But the idea that fascists are fastidious enough to maintain such a coherent body of ideology is something that many scholars have come to reject. Robert O Paxton, for example, shows in The Anatomy of Fascism that the common ground shared by various interwar fascist movements belonged \u201cmore to the realm of visceral feelings than reasoned propositions\u201d, and that \u201cwhat fascists did tells us at least as much as what they said\u201d. For Paxton, far more important than the shifting sands of fascist rhetoric and policy were the gut-level, affective components of the movement, including a suffocating sense of crisis, a belief in the beauty of violence, a desire for the restoration of an imagined national ethnic purity, a hatred of liberalism and the left, and a sense that their own group is in decline and under attack by liberalism or \u201calien\u201d influences. Such sentiments were discernible in what the St Kilda group did and said before, during and after their confrontation with anti-racist counterprotesters in Melbourne. At the megaphone on Saturday, Blair Cottrell, a convicted criminal and fan of Adolf Hitler, absurdly claimed that Australia was \u201cunder attack\u201d by young Africans. You can be sure that his listeners believed him. Perhaps Sunderland, and others like Mike Carlton, are afraid of over-inflating the importance of a poorly organised group. This idea is related to the notion that fascist groups will perish in the absence of attention from media and counterprotesters. As recent experience in the United States and elsewhere has shown, these ideas are delusions. Attention is precisely what leads these groups to come apart. The fact is that wherever we find it, the far right tends to be fractious. If this fractiousness is overcome, it is not by means of rational debate, but by the cultivation of shared hatreds that lead to unifying action. In his work on the myth of \u201cJudeo-Bolshevism\u201d in inter-war Europe, and its role in coalescing fascist movements, Paul Hanebrink shows how racist attacks \u201cwere a political tool that helped different warring parties to unify their disparate forces and whip up popular support for their cause\u201d. Similarly, by focusing on a particular migrant community, rally organiser Neil Erikson and Cottrell were able to pull a disparate collection of far-right groups and \u2013 it bears repeating \u2013 a sitting federal politician into a park. There, to be sure, they harnessed attention from various media outlets (some of which have themselves been complicit in creating the African gangs myth). But now, in the social media era, such groups effectively have their own media apparatus. An unopposed protest would equally have been hailed as a victory, and used in further recruitment efforts. Paxton analyses fascism as a five-stage process. Even in the late 1990s, before the current global surge of the far right, he was able to say that \u201cfascism exists at the level of stage one in all democratic countries\u201d \u2013 ie, the level at which a disillusionment with liberal democracy becomes the basis for a movement which welds heterogenous resentments together to create a fascist \u201cmood\u201d. The second stage, in which fascists become players on a national stage in electoral or pressure group politics, may not have arrived in Australia, but the presence of Fraser Anning shows that fascists are making connections at the heart of representative democracy. Generally, fascists have only succeeded in moving even closer to the centre of power with the collaboration or assistance of mainstream conservatives. This brings us to the question of how this rally ever came to be. One important thing to notice about the rally on Saturday is that it was directed at a \u201cproblem\u201d (so-called \u201cAfrican gangs\u201d) which conservatives \u2013 in politics and the media \u2013 relentlessly focused on over the course of several years. This became particularly intense during 2018 as the Victorian Liberal party, and their handmaidens in conservative media, chose to make racial panic the centrepiece of their state election campaign. The idea that lawless African gangs are terrorising Melbourne never had any real basis, but the Liberal party, News Corp and elements of tabloid television presented it as a threat that the Labor party was not equipped to respond to. (Infamously, Channel Seven even gave a platform last year to Blair Cottrell). Thankfully, most voters either didn\u2019t believe them or did not consider the issue salient enough to give their vote to Matthew Guy. But to the extent that the story was believed, and became a source of fear and resentment for a segment of Victorians, it afforded an opportunity to the extreme right. In carrying the idea that African gangs were holding the city to ransom to a humiliating electoral defeat, the Liberals and their allies have created space for the argument that no solution to the mythical problem is available within the confines of parliamentary democracy. In whipping up fear about a single, marginalised community, conservatives also gave a sizeable boost to the far-right project of creating visceral fears about outsiders. The weak condemnation of the rally by the prime minister, and the silence of Matthew Guy, have done nothing to remedy this. A nascent fascist movement is now offering to solve the \u201cproblem\u201d in a way that they will say conservatives are too squeamish to contemplate: direct, violent action. This is the soil in which extra-parliamentary far-right movements grow. For now, the movement that Erikson, Cottrell and others preside over is small. It will only be kept small if we call it by its name and support those who show up to oppose it. \u2022 Jason Wilson is a Guardian writer and columnist",

The defending champion Philadelphia Eagles are on the road against the Chicago Bears. It will be something of a challenge, not only are they in hostile territory, they are facing a very tough Bears defense. </p> <p>If they win, the legend of Nick Foles will only grow. One of the most improbable Super Bowl MVPs in NFL history, he can pretty much expect a statue in Philadelphia should he win a few more games. <br></p> <p>As always you can join in our coverage.

We\u2019re scheduled to start around 4:45pm EST but we\u2019ll be back well before then.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c3225dee4b072dc52e697bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-06T16:00:25.761Z\">4.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hunter will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s his rundown of today\u2019s game:</p> <p><strong>What the Eagles need to do to win</strong>: Rely on <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2019/1/3/18166088/philadelphia-eagles-nick-foles-playoff-superhero\">Nick Foles\u2019s magic?</a> At this point it\u2019s ridiculous to think that the Eagles\u2019 backup QB can keep leading them to victory whenever Carson Wentz goes down. But, hey, it keeps happening so why not keep believing? After earning Super Bowl MVP honors last year, Foles came in for Wentz again this season and helped the Eagles rattle off three straight wins to make the postseason.</p> <p><strong>What the Bears needs to do to win</strong>: They need to play the same defense that got them here. Quarterback Mitchell Trubisky has been just about everything the team could have hoped for this season, but it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/03/ditkaland-dispatches-why-chicago-should-rethink-its-80s-nostalgia\">never about the offense</a> in Chicago. When the Bears win it\u2019s because they have an elite defense, and this time around it\u2019s no different. Bolstered by the Khalil Mack trade, Chicago\u2019s defense is ranked third in the league and primed to turn Foles back into a pumpkin.</p> <p><strong>Key player</strong>: <strong>Khalil Mack, OLB, Chicago Bears</strong>. The Bears traded two first-round picks to the Oakland Raiders to get Mack and then gave him a six-year/$141m contract, making him <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-khalil-mack-magical-season-htmlstory.html\">the highest paid defender</a> in NFL history. He ended the year with 12.5 sacks, 47 tackles and a handful of key takeaways. Looks like he was worth it.</p> <p><strong>Prediction: </strong>Eagles 16-21 Bears</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "You can read a rundown of Sunday\u2019s games here: This is the first time I think that icing the kicker worked. Had the Eagles not called for a timeout, Cody Parkey\u2019s kick would have won it. Instead, the Eagles will be facing the New Orleans Saints next Sunday! What an end and what a terrible way to end the season for the Chicago Bears. That will wrap up Wild Card Weekend and wrap up our live coverage here at the Guardian. Thanks to all who followed along especially those who contributed to the blog. Ciao! I cannot believe how that happened. And the Legend of Nick Foles grows with a miracle assist from a goal post! What a brutal, brutal loss for the Bears. Eagles 16-15 Bears, FINAL And the field goal hits the upright! It\u2019s no good! The Eagles win! Eagles 16-15 Bears, :10, 4th quarter The Bears can\u2019t get any farther. So it sets up a 43-yard field goal attempt. The Eagles take a timeout to ice the kicker. Eagles 16-15 Bears, :35, 4th quarter Trubisky\u2019s first pass is incomplete. On 2nd &amp; 10, Trubisky makes a phenomenal throw to Robinson who makes it to 25 yard line. Eagles 16-15 Bears, :48, 4th quarter It doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s going to be enough evidence to overturn the call on the field. Or I\u2019m wrong, they confirm it. The Eagles kick it off to the Bears. Cohen returns it\u2026 and wow, he eludes the Eagles defense to take it to the 42 yard line. Eagles 16-15 Bears, :56, 4th quarter The Eagles decide to go for two so a field goal won\u2019t win it. Smallwood gets the ball but Smallwood doesn\u2019t get it. At least it doesn\u2019t appear that he did. It\u2019s under review. Eagles 16-15 Bears, :56, 4th quarter So it\u2019s all coming down to this. Eagles take a time out. Foles finds Golden Tate AND THIS TIME IT\u2019S GOOD! Tate MAKES THE CATCH. Wow. Eagles 10-15 Bears, 1:01, 4th quarter On 2nd &amp; goal, Sproles runs for no game. 3rd and goal. Foles throws to Jeffrey and it\u2019s no good. 4th down play. Eagles 10-15 Bears, 1:10, 4th quarter Jeffrey gets it to 2 yard line and a first down after a Foles throw. Eagles 10-15 Bears, 2:35, 4th quarter 1st &amp; 10, Smallwood picks up a yard. 2nd &amp; 9, Smallwood gets it to the Bears nine. Huge 3rd &amp; 8 coming up. This could be the game. Eagles 10-15 Bears, 3:13, 4th quarter Foles throws to Agholor who runs it to the 27. This is getting dicey for Chicago. Foles throws to Ertz who picks up 13 and they\u2019re in the red zone now at the Bears 14. Eagles 10-15 Bears, 3:20, 4th quarter Foles\u2019s first down toss is incomplete. He instead goes to Goedert on second down and the picks up 10 and it\u2019s another first down and the Eagles are on the 35 yard line after his run. Eagles 10-15 Bears, 4:48, 4th quarter On 1st &amp; 10, Foles throws to Jeffrey who picks up 15 yards and they\u2019re already in Bears territory. Eagles 10-15 Bears, 4:57, 4th quarter It\u2019s not a great punt. O\u2019Donnell 36 yarder means the Eagles will be starting at their own 40. Eagles 10-15 Bears, 5:38, 4th quarter 1st and 10 for the Bears. Howard takes a bit too much time on first down and the Eagles defense swarms him for a two yard loss. Then the pocket falls apart for Trubisky, who gets sacked for a 7 yard loss. On 3rd &amp; 19, Trubisky avoids a sack on 3rd &amp; 19, but Cohen can only pick up 7 yards. The punt team comes out. Eagles 10-15 Bears, 7:10, 4th quarte The Eagles are at their own 27. Sproles runs for a two yard gain. 2nd &amp; 8, Foles throws incomplete. The Bears blitz and Foles throws incomplete. The Bears end the drive and Foles has made some iffy throws on the drive. The Eagles have to punt. Cohen makes a fair catch at the Bears 26 and time is starting to tick off. Eagles 10-15 Bears, 8:00, 4th quarter What did I say about the teams trading touchdowns in the second half? Can the Eagles pull it off this time? I am making some great predictions here (please do not mention that I thought that the Ravens would win). On the kickoff Boston Scott (nice first name) gets wrapped up on the 14-yard line. Khalil Mack makes a huge defensive play to wrap up Foles on a 1st &amp; 10 throw that ends up in no man\u2019s land. His second pass is incomplete as the Bears break up the play. The D has stepped up here. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 10 and this place is loud. Foles throws again\u2026 and this time it\u2019s caught for a first down. Eagles 10-15 Bears, 9:04, 4th quarter On 1st &amp; 10, Howard picks up 6 yards and on 2nd &amp; 4, Trubisky finds Bellamy for a 34 yard gain. The Eagles have to scramble to stop him from the touchdown. The Bears are at the Eagles 22. On the next play, Trubisky finds Robinson who takes it to the end zone. There\u2019s a flag on the play but it\u2019s on the defense. The Bears are going to decline. The Bears line up for a two point conversion attempt\u2026 Gabriel tries to get into the end zone, but it\u2019s no good. Still the Bears get the lead. Eagles 10-9 Bears, 10:36, 4th quarter Great defensive stand for the Bears after cutting down on the Philadelphia lead. Trubisky hands off to Gabriel who gets taken down for a one yard loss. On 2nd &amp; 11, Trubisky throws to Gabirel. That\u2019s a loss. On 3rd and 11, WOW, he very much finds Gabriel for a long throw. That\u2019s a 19 yard gain and a first down. Nice protection there, as the broadcast team points out. Eagles 10-9 Bears, 12:08, 4th quarter The Eagles will start off at their own 26 after kickoff. Foles throws to Jeffrey for a gain of one yard on 1st down. Smallwood then goes off for 6 yards. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 3 at their own 33. Sproles goes off again, for two yards. That\u2019s a 3-and-out and the Eagles have to punt. Johnston punts to the Bears 20 where Cohen makes a fair catch. Eagles 10-9 Bears, 14:13, 4th quarter Trubisky scrambles for 5 yards and that will bring out the field goal unit. The 34-yard attempt is good and it\u2019s a one-point game. Eagles 10-6 Bears, end of the 3rd quarter And the Bears remain on the Eagles 21 at the end of the third quarter. Eagles 10-6 Bears, 1:19, 3rd quarter Trubisky throws a laser to Robinson for a 13 yard gain. That was a beauty. Trubinsky finds Roinbson again for a 41 yard gain all the way to the Eagles 21. His next throw is to Robinson again, but Robinson is out of bounds. Eagles 10-6 Bears, 1:42, 3rd quarter Foles throws to Sproles, and that\u2019s 10 yards and another 10 yards. Their offense seems to be clicking. Sproles gets the ball again and he works his way to the 40 yard line And never mind about the Eagles offense. The next two passes are incomplete and that\u2019s a punt. Cohen makes a fair catch at the Bears 22. Eagles 10-6 Bears, 2:10, 3rd quarter Foles throws to Sproles, and that\u2019s 10 yards and another 10 yards. Their offense seems to be clicking. Sproles gets the ball again and he works his way to the 40 yard line. Eagles 10-6 Bears, 3:17, 3rd quarter Foles throws to Ertz for about 11 yards for a definite first down. Eagles 10-6 Bears, 3:58, 3rd quarter The Bears pick up two yards on second down on a Howard run. Cre\u2019Von LeBlanc tackles Shaheen to prevent a first down and the Bears have to punt. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s punt pins the Eagles at their own 17. Eagles 10-6 Bears, 5:10, 3rd quarter The kickoff hits the end zone. The Bears start from their own 25. Trubisky throws incomplete on the first play of the drive. Eagles 10-6 Bears, 5:13, 3rd quarter On the very next play, Foles finds Dallas Goedert in the end zone for the first touchdown of the game! The extra point is good and the Eagles take the lead. Eagles 3-6 Bears, 5:26, 3rd quarter And the second penalty on the Bears. A too many men on the field call puts the Eagles into Bears territory. On 1st and 5, Sproles gets the ball to the 43. Foles throws incomplete on the next play, but the Bears get ANOTHER penalty. It\u2019s a 33 yard pass interference call that will put the Eagles on their 10 yard line. Brutal. Eagles 3-6 Bears, 7:09, 3rd quarter Foles targets Sproles, who picks up 4 yards. Foles finds Tate on 2nd &amp; 6, that\u2019s just a yard gain. It\u2019s 3rd and 5 and the Bears fans get loud. It\u2019s no help, Foles finds Tate who just stays inbound at the Eagles 40 for a first down. Eagles 3-6 Bears, 8:14, 3rd quarter I\u2019m just going to predict the first touchdown of the game on this drive because, I mean, there\u2019s got to be on eventually right? Foles\u2019s first throw is a four yard pass to Zach Ertz. On 2nd and 5, Foles gets wrapped up. 3rd and 6. Foles throws a long lob\u2026 that\u2019s incomplete but there\u2019s a flag. It\u2019s on Amos, unnecessary roughness. That\u2019s a 15 yard penalty and an automatic first down. First penalty on the Bears and a MASSIVE ONE. Eagles 3-6 Bears, 9:51, 3rd quarter Trubisky gets sacked for five yards and then finds Ben Braunnecker for a gain of nine years. On 3rd down, the pressure Trubisky who throws it away and their first drive will end with a punt. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s kick pins the Eagles at their 17. Eagles 3-6 Bears, 12:05, 3rd quarter Trubisky passes to Adam Shaheen for no gain. On 2nd and 10, he finds Robinson for 9 and then Howard manages to get five yards. The Bears make it to the Eagles 49 and have a fresh set of downs. Eagles 3-6 Bears, 13:09, 3rd quarter Howard gets stuffed for a yard on the first play of the drive. Trubisky hits Gabriel who goes off for a 22 yard run. That will be a first down and a bunch more. Eagles 3-6 Bears, 15:00, 3rd quarter The Eagles kick the ball off. The Bears will start from their own 17 after the reception. An explanation of the incomplete pass that was also a catch. Do you buy it? Email from Justin Kavanagh Good evening Hunter. I was in the torture chair yesterday when my dentist mentioned that \u201cyou live down near Nick Foles\u201d, which was news to me. I live in a very modest suburb of Philadelphia. So the idea of Mr Foles accepting a statue in the City of Bro Love is probably a non-starter. Besides (and this has always tickled my Irish sense of absurdity), despite Philly having had so many world champions down the years (from Joe Frazier to Bernard Hopkins), the only one they ever bothered commemorating in bronze is the fictitious boxer from the cheesy Hollywood franchise. Oh God, I\u2019m beginning to rant about sports\u2026I\u2019ve been in Philly too long! Speaking as someone who moved to Boston in their early 20s: just let the transformation to local sports nut happen. Don\u2019t try to fight it, it\u2019s inevitable. After many years of faithful liveblogging for the Guardian, my old computer got crushed on the way to Fenway Park. In any case, the good news is that I have a brand new laptop which means I don\u2019t have to reset it halfway through the game because it\u2019s about to overheat. That means more halftime commentary from me this time around. I apologize in advance. The game? I usually am not a fan of defensive battles, but this has been entertaining, both sides are making key plays. I don\u2019t expect it to last, look for these two teams to start trading touchdowns in the second half. That\u2019s my prediction. I will never understand the NFL catch rules. Eagles 3-6 Bears, end of the first half The 29-yard field goal is good and that will do us for the first half which had no touchdowns but was certainly full of action. Eagles 3-3 Bears, 2nd quarter :13 Nick Foles throws a dangerous pass to the Eagles end zone that is incomplete. The Bears end up not being able to get it past the Eagles 23 yard line to set up a field goal attempt. The Eagles call a time out. Eagles 3-3 Bears, 2nd quarter :29 it\u2019s overruled as a catch, but it looks like Miller loss the fumble except\u2026 nobody recovered the ball! So they keep up the call on the field. Of an incomplete catch. EXCEPT IT WAS it just wasn\u2019t recovered by anyone on the fumble. In any case it\u2019s 3rd and 3 and the Bears get the first down Eagles 3-3 Bears, 2nd quarter :29 On 3rd and 3, an illegal use of the hands penalty on the Eagles give them an automatic first down that takes them to the Philadelphia 47. The Bears are in the shotgun with the clock going down. Trubisky finds Robinson for 7 yards. On 2nd &amp; 3, Trubisky throws to Miller who\u2026 can\u2019t hold on. Or does he, it\u2019s ruled an incomplete pass. They\u2019re going to review it. It goes to review. Eagles 3-3 Bears, 2nd quarter, 1:27 That takes things down to the two minute warning, catching me slightly unawares. On the next play, there\u2019s an offside play on the Eagles, but the Bears picked up a first down on the play thanks to a nine yard Trubsiky pass to Anthony Miller. So, they decline the penalty. On the next throw, Trubisky throws VERY DEEP, that\u2019s a 23 yard pass to Miller to get them to their 44. Eagles 3-3 Bears, 2nd quarter, 2:38 Trubisky throws to Gabriel for a one yard gain. Eagles 3-3 Bears, 2nd quarter, 2:45 Smallwood gets taken down for a two yard loss on first down. 2nd &amp; 12, Foles throws over the middle but incomplete. The Eagles look for a flag but there\u2019s none to come. 3rd &amp; 12. Foles\u2019s next throw is to Tate, but they only pick up six yards and that\u2019s gonna be another punt, this one goes out of bounds at the 15 yard line. Eagles 3-3 Bears, 2nd quarter, 4:14 Trubisky\u2019s third down pass is caught just out of bounds so it\u2019s going to be a punt. Still, that could have gone much worse for Chicago. Sproles picks up the punt at the 33 yard line where the Eagles will start their next drive. We were promised a defensive battle and that\u2019s what we\u2019re getting. Eagles 3-3 Bears, 2nd quarter, 4:31 After review, it\u2019s ruled an incomplete pass, just one leg was in. So it\u2019s going to be a 3rd and 9. Eagles 3-3 Bears, 2nd quarter, 5:10 More good news for Chicago, Trubisky is out there. With the worries about the quarterback for Chicago fans, it\u2019s looking like Foles has been the one struggling. That was his second pick of the game. Oh never mind, Trubisky throws an interception that Avonte Maddox just corrals. OR DOES HE. It\u2019s going to review and this is going to be a close one. Eagles 3-3 Bears, 2nd quarter, 5:27 Sproles gets the ball on first down and he picks up a yard. 2nd &amp; 9, Foles escapes the pocket and throws\u2026 a ball that is PICKED OFF IN THE END ZONE by Adrian Amos. He decides to stay there and the Bears will be starting on their own 20. Eagles 3-3 Bears, 2nd quarter, 6:40 Foles hands off to Sproles who gets five yards. He goes again and Sproles gets stuffed. That sets up a 3rd &amp; 6, Foles throws deep, very deep, 28 yards to Golden Tate. Eagles are at the Chicago 25. Eagles 3-3 Bears, 2nd quarter, 7:53 Trubisky is in the medical tent. That\u2019s not a place you want to be, one of the least fun tents possible really. In any case, Chicago\u2019s kickoff pins the Eagles on the 25 yard line. Wendell Smallwood picks up ten yards for a Philadelphia first down. He gets nowhere on the second attempt. 2nd &amp; 10, Foles throws a ball that Nelson Agholor has to slide to catch for an 11 yard gain. Eagles 3-3 Bears, 2nd quarter, 9:42 Cohen can\u2019t get anywhere on a first down run. On second down, Trubisky fires Allen Robinson, who is wrapped up immediately. Trubisky runs for six yards, not quite enough for a first down. He leaves the field a little gimpy, which is not\u2026 ideal for Chicago. Cody Parkey has a chance to tie things up with a field goal which he does by nailing a 36 yarder. Eagles 3-0 Bears, 2nd quarter, 11:47 The Bears can\u2019t take advantage of the turnover it seems\u2026 but there\u2019s an unnecessary roughness call on Michael Bennett for an automatic first down. That puts Chicago on their own 42. There Trubisky makes a nice throw, 19 yards, that put Bears on the 19 yard. Huge penalty on Bennett. Eagles 3-0 Bears, 2nd quarter, 14:25 Foles throws to Jeffrey for a 30 yard run to the 40 yard mark. It\u2019s looking good for Eagles but Trubisky throws a pick to Roquan Smith. He runs it down but the officials say he was down by contact on the Bears 34. Eagles 3-0 Bears, 1st quarter, end of the 1st quarter On 2nd down, Foles throws to Alshon Jeffrey to their own 30 for a first down. That will end the first quarter. Eagles 3-0 Bears, 1st quarter, 1:01 Darren Sproles gets the ball to start this Eagles drive and he goes nowhere or, well okay, the officials spot him a yard. Foles\u2019s neck throw DEFINITELY goes nowhere. 3rd &amp; 9. Sproles\u2026 just barely gets the first down at the 18 yard line. Eagles 3-0 Bears, 1st quarter, 2:41 So Chicago\u2019s starting in Eagles territory. On 1st and 10, Trubisky fires\u2026 and it\u2019s knocked away. He hand off Jordan Howard instead, he finds a hole, and grabs 6 yards. 3rd &amp; 4. Trubisky fires under pressure and it\u2019s incomplete. Man, the Bears can\u2019t capitalize on fantastic starting position. They\u2019re gonna punt. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s punt puts the Eagles at their 7. The defenses are doing their job to start this game, that\u2019s for sure. Eagles 3-0 Bears, 1st quarter, 3:29 Well that was a defensive stop. A 3-and-0 forces the Eagles to punt from their own 3. Tarik Cohen makes a fair catch for Chicago at the Eagles 48. Huge field position for Chicago. Eagles 3-0 Bears, 1st quarter, 5:01 First flag of the game, on the punt. The Bears have to re-kick after a defensive offside penalty on Philadelphia. Five yard penalty. Pat O\u2019Donnell\u2019s punt sprials out of bounds after pinning the Eagles at the one. Eagles 3-0 Bears, 1st quarter, 5:19 The Bears get it to their own 45, where they pick up the first down. Trubisky\u2019s gone 3-for-3 with his throws. And then the Eagles defense kicks in, they stuff a running attempt for no gain and then Trubisky gets chased and throws incomplete. That\u2019s a 3rdand 10. And his next throw is also incomplete, almost intercepted and that will end the first Chicago drive. They\u2019re going to punt. Eagles 3-0 Bears, 1st quarter, 9:24 Email from Michael A. Just don\u2019t trust Chicago\u2019s QB., Here is a liability.I see the Eagles winning this. Well, it\u2019s Mitch Trubisky\u2019s time up now, let\u2019s see how he fares. Elliott kicks off and the Eagles return it to their own 21. Eagles 3-0 Bears, 1st quarter, 9:37 The Bears defense steps up, and forces another 3rd down, where the Bears sack Foles for 8 yards to force a field goal. Jake Elliott\u2019s 43 yard field goal is good, but a moral victory for Chicago. Eagles 0-0 Bears, 1st quarter, 13:08 The Bears get the Eagles to a 3rd &amp; 8 in Bears territory, but Foles unleashes a long throw to get the Eagles to the Chicago 20. They are threatening already. Eagles 0-0 Bears, 1st quarter, 15:00 The Bears kick it off to the Eagles. The Guardian game report for Chargers/Ravens is up! That\u2019s going to be a huge key here. Honestly, I don\u2019t think the O line will embarrass themselves, but I just think this Bears defense is just going to have the advantage. If they manage to neutralize Mack, someone else will step up. I think Foles is still going to make a few big throws though. The Chargers will be playing the New England Patriots next weekend. Philip Rivers vs Tom Brady might be a decent quarterback matchup. I know, that\u2019s a rather bold prediction but I\u2019m willing to go out on a limb like that. Chargers/Ravens It\u2019s final in Baltimore! The Los Angeles Chargers just held off the Baltimore Ravens. Rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson fumbled the ball on their last chance of the drive. I think someone predicted that this game could come down to Jackson\u2019s ball security issues earlier. The Chargers win 23-17. Bears fans are getting pumped for the start of this one. Big if true. Saturday\u2019s results Yesterday\u2019s two games were radically different. If you missed the first half of the battle between the Houston Texans and the Indianapolis Colts then, well, you missed the entire game. Andrew Luck and the Colts trounced the Texans 21-7. Meanwhile the Dallas Cowboys snuffed out a last minute comeback attempt by the Seattle Seahawks to hold onto a 24-22 victory. Welcome to the fourth an final game of Wild Card Weekend! The defending champion Philadelphia Eagles are on the road against the Chicago Bears. It will be something of a challenge, not only are they in hostile territory, they are facing a very tough Bears defense. If they win, the legend of Nick Foles will only grow. One of the most improbable Super Bowl MVPs in NFL history, he can pretty much expect a statue in Philadelphia should he win a few more games. As always you can join in our coverage. You can email us your commentary, questions, predictions and jokes (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or Tweet them (to @HunterFelt). We\u2019re scheduled to start around 4:45pm EST but we\u2019ll be back well before then. Hunter will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s his rundown of today\u2019s game: What the Eagles need to do to win: Rely on Nick Foles\u2019s magic? At this point it\u2019s ridiculous to think that the Eagles\u2019 backup QB can keep leading them to victory whenever Carson Wentz goes down. But, hey, it keeps happening so why not keep believing? After earning Super Bowl MVP honors last year, Foles came in for Wentz again this season and helped the Eagles rattle off three straight wins to make the postseason. What the Bears needs to do to win: They need to play the same defense that got them here. Quarterback Mitchell Trubisky has been just about everything the team could have hoped for this season, but it\u2019s never about the offense in Chicago. When the Bears win it\u2019s because they have an elite defense, and this time around it\u2019s no different. Bolstered by the Khalil Mack trade, Chicago\u2019s defense is ranked third in the league and primed to turn Foles back into a pumpkin. Key player: Khalil Mack, OLB, Chicago Bears. The Bears traded two first-round picks to the Oakland Raiders to get Mack and then gave him a six-year/$141m contract, making him the highest paid defender in NFL history. He ended the year with 12.5 sacks, 47 tackles and a handful of key takeaways. Looks like he was worth it. Prediction: Eagles 16-21 Bears",
