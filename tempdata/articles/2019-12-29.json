A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/03/pound-falls-lowest-level-three-years-brexit-election-sterling\" title=\"\">weakening pound</a> has made ingredients more expensive, while mixed messages on residency rights for EU citizens has caused myriad problems for the workforce, particularly front of house. Although we now have certainty, and will leave at the end of January, none of that seems likely to improve in 2020.

A weakening pound has made ingredients more expensive, while mixed messages on residency rights for EU citizens has caused myriad problems for the workforce, particularly front of house. Although we now have certainty, and will leave at the end of January, none of that seems likely to improve in 2020. Indeed, anecdotally, restaurateurs and chefs are reporting that it\u2019s harder than ever to retain non-UK staff, who quite reasonably question whether they have a future here. There\u2019s a similar problem in the food processing sector, parts of which have historically been dominated by eastern European labour. Difficulties retaining staff usually lead to salary increases to encourage them to stay, and that cost has to be passed on to the consumer.

Over at the British Museum, a new show Living with art: Picasso to Celmins starts in January, before a national tour, and will feature works given to the museum by the late film critic Alexander Walker. Highlights will include Jungle Boy, an early etching by David Hockney. In the cinema, the British year gets off to a good start with Sam Mendes\u2019 1917 and Armando Iannucci\u2019s The Personal History of David Copperfield, both out in January, but the new Bond, No Time to Die, is now not being released until April. Smaller budget productions to look out for include Rose Glass\u2019s acclaimed horror debut Saint Maud, starring Morfydd Clark, and the film of Florian Zeller\u2019s stage hit The Father, which premieres at the Sundance film festival in January. Vanessa Thorpe Three to watch Johnny Flynn Already familiar to fans of the 2018 TV series of Les Miserables and Vanity Fair, the actor will have a big year. He appears as Bowie in Stardust and as a blond (shock) Knightley in a film of Jane Austen\u2019s Emma, alongside Bill Nighy and Miranda Hart. Another Brit film The Dig, about an archaeologist, is also due to put him up on the big screen soon. Nicky Morgan The reappointed culture secretary, now operating from the elevated calm of the House of Lords, will receive pleas from all manner of cash-starved arts schemes, venues and institutes. Will she stay in the job for the long term, and, if so, will she listen? Adele Rumours about the release date for her putative fourth album (30?) are likely to reach fever pitch after a turbulent few years out of the limelight. Royals After a stormy year, the royal family face a challenging 2020 to steady the good ship Monarchy. The Queen, who will be 94 in April, looks increasingly alone as the Duke of Edinburgh, who will be 99 in June, leads a near solitary life on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Decisions by some family members have raised questions over how much the Queen is consulted by others who may be keen to pursue their own agendas. Prince Andrew\u2019s astonishing TV interview with Newsnight\u2019s Emily Maitlis, may have put Pizza Express, Woking, on the map and had a nation googling medical conditions that prevent sweating, but any hopes that it would dampen the burning debate over his relationship with the disgraced late US financier Jeffrey Epstein are badly misplaced. With Epstein\u2019s alleged victims\u2019 lawyers\u2019 relentless efforts to drag the prince into their legal battle in the US, this long saga looks set to continue, despite Andrew stepping back from public life for the foreseeable future. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, meanwhile, are pursuing their own legal actions as part of a bold and risky strategy in taking on the press over privacy. Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday over its publication of a private letter to her estranged father. Harry has launched legal proceedings against the owners of the Sun and the Daily Mirror in relation to alleged phone hacking. The couple escaped to Canada for six weeks in November after Meghan told ITV\u2019s Tom Bradby of the strain she felt she was under in the media spotlight. They launch their own foundation in 2020, after splitting from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, so all eyes will be on how they will carve out their future royal roles. Caroline Davies Three to watch Prince Charles Expect him to undertake more of the Queen\u2019s public duties. Prince William A successful visit to Pakistan with the Duchess of Cambridge this year could lead to more roles as a statesman as he prepares to succeed his father as Prince of Wales. Baby Archie First we saw a forehead and nose, then a foot, and a couple of months later, a face. But the full Archie wasn\u2019t revealed by the Sussexes until they introduced him to Desmond Tutu in South Africa in September. Royal fans are still waiting for his first UK appearance.",

      "bodyText": "Emily Maitlis has defended the BBC against accusations of bias, saying that people often think something is a conspiracy when it is a actually a \u201cconfluence of cock-ups\u201d. The debate about whose side the BBC is on, both politically and otherwise, gained traction during a particularly fractious general election campaign that saw ministers repeatedly grilled by presenters on Radio 4\u2019s\u2019 Today and other programmes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I buy the argument that the public is more mistrustful \u2013 the debate will always garner that kind of traction because anything the BBC does is always in the spotlight,\u201d Maitlis, Newsnight\u2019s chief presenter, told the Observer. \u201cSo often people read conspiracy into a thing when it\u2019s really a confluence of cock-ups and the wrong button being pressed at the wrong time, or the guest you wanted gets into the wrong taxi and doesn\u2019t show up.\u201d Maitlis\u2019s intervention in the debate follows that of the BBC\u2019s director general, Tony Hall, who last week defended the organisation against claims that its election coverage failed to remain impartial in a fast-changing media and political landscape. The BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, came under particular scrutiny, first when she uncritically posted a link to a racist, fear-mongering blog by the prime minister\u2019s special adviser Dominic Cummings, and later when she was accused of peddling \u201cfake news\u201d by tweeting false claims that a Tory aide had been punched by a leftwing activist. \u201cI have enormous respect for Laura, She does an impossible job bloody brilliantly,\u201d said Maitlis. \u201cI just think there is a lesson for all of us in what we do with the stuff we\u2019re told, how we double-check it and how we scrutinise what we\u2019re told, even by people who seemingly should be trusted.\u201d She blames what she described as the \u201cpopulist playbook\u201d for exploiting the frenetic news cycle she has been up against in the last four years in particular. \u201cIt starts with denigrating experts so people don\u2019t trust facts, then it destabilises institutions, then it works to get its message out in the media, so that\u2019s what people cling to. And what can you do about any of that but know you are constantly pushing against that narrative?\u201d Maitlis began the year working on her book, Airhead, reflecting on the interviews that have made her career as one of the BBC\u2019s highest-paid journalists: the meetings with presidents, prime ministers and the Dalai Lama. But it was her now infamous interview with Prince Andrew that thrust her into the spotlight this year. Maitlis\u2019s firm and unrelenting questioning of the Duke of York, under which he addressed allegations that he had sex with a teenager trafficked by his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, forced him to withdraw from public life.
