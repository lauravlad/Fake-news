      "body": "<p>George Monbiot (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/25/capitalism-economic-system-survival-earth\" title=\"\">Time to declare the system dead \u2013 before it takes us down with it</a>, 25 April) says he has slowly and reluctantly rejected capitalism because the endless impulse for growth and wealth creation ineluctably drives climate change. Asad Rehman, executive director of War on Want, in his global justice seminar at the Extinction Rebellion protests, focused more on neoliberalism \u2013 the even more rapacious, ever-expanding incarnation of capitalist exploitation of people and planet over the last four decades \u2013 as the driver of global climate inequality and impending calamity. But left-of-centre ideologies also focus on growth in the bid to tackle inequality, with social and economic priorities overshadowing ecological imperatives.</p> <p>This paper has had occasional discussions of the degrowth movement. In one such, Christiane Kliemann (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jan/23/lets-face-it-we-have-to-make-the-choice-between-our-economy-and-our-future\" title=\"\">Let\u2019s face it: we have to choose between our economy and our future</a>, 23 January 2015) posited that once we have accepted there are only radical options left, we have a choice between our economy and our future if we are to meet everybody\u2019s needs more sustainably and equitably, using fewer resources. More focus on degrowth on the political left, and more analysis in these pages of its underpinnings and its potential, could contribute to movements for creating a global economy that can truly be described as \u201cours\u201d, and a future not only for those of us in the global north, but also a present for those in the global south already experiencing the ravages of growth-driven climate change. <br><strong>Sarah Cemlyn</strong><br><em>Bristol</em></p> <p>\u2022 For once I disagree with George Monbiot. He overlooks one idea favoured by environmentalists and thinking capitalists: the circular economy. This idea doesn\u2019t attack capitalism per se, rather the traditional take\u2013make\u2013use\u2013waste structure of its linear economy, a structure also found in communism, and a pernicious habit of human life. In a circular economy, resources remain in use for as long as possible, giving their maximum value. Products and materials (both natural and technological) enjoy as many \u201cservice lives\u201d as possible. Products and packaging are designed for maximum reuse, repair and refurbishment, thus relegating recycling and energy extraction to the last resort. Reverse logistics provide return networks, with local reuse prioritised.</p> <p>In my view, circular economy is just as necessary as rewilding, emissions reduction and carbon sequestration if we are to slam the carbon brakes on within a decade. Perhaps it is more necessary because, unlike them, it gives objectives and structure to the good transformation of our way of life.</p> <p>I suggest a look at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation for much deeper thinking on circular economy. I have only one quibble with them, which is that so far they say little on how people and communities can contribute \u2013 which we can. They seem focused on changing capitalism.<br><strong>Malcolm Fowles</strong><br><em>Reading, Berkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot calls for replacing capitalism, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/24/library-of-things-borrowing-scheme-conquer-world\" title=\"\">G2 article on the library of things</a> (25 April) hints at a solution. Surely the fourth industrial revolution will involve cooperatives providing many of the services we have come to depend on? As an example, in Zurich \u2013 one of the world\u2019s wealthiest and happiest cities \u2013 25% of homes are owned by cooperatives and the city government is raising the proportion to a third. As a consequence, a much wider range of people live on low rents, and have fuller and less wasteful lives.<br><strong>Dr Nicholas Falk</strong><br><em>Executive director, The URBED Trust</em></p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot powerfully argues that constant economic growth on a finite planet results in environmental meltdown. He suggests we need a range of thinkers to frame a coherent alternative to capitalism. A genuinely democratic socialism with a solid workplace and local basis has already a number of blueprints.

Huawei is technically majority-owned by its employee union. As with all legal trade unions in China, however, Huawei\u2019s union will be controlled by the Communist party. Additionally, as with other large privately owned firms, Huawei has a party branch, <a href=\"https://www.huawei.com/en/about-huawei/executives/supervisory-board/zhou-daiqi\" title=\"\">currently headed by Zhou Daiqi</a>. Although Mr Zhou is Huawei\u2019s director of ethics and compliance, it is almost certainly in his role as party secretary that he serves as a member of Huawei\u2019s executive committee.</p> <p>As China is a Leninist state, it is the Communist party that ultimately controls all government agencies, state-owned companies and, probably, private companies where it has a formal presence.

      "bodyText": "The government is right that Huawei is not owned by the Chinese regime, but it seems to have missed \u2013 or ignored \u2013 the fact that it is probably controlled by the Chinese Communist party (Conservatives will push next party leader to scrap Huawei\u2019s \u2018non-core\u2019 5G contract, 25 April). Huawei is technically majority-owned by its employee union. As with all legal trade unions in China, however, Huawei\u2019s union will be controlled by the Communist party. Additionally, as with other large privately owned firms, Huawei has a party branch, currently headed by Zhou Daiqi. Although Mr Zhou is Huawei\u2019s director of ethics and compliance, it is almost certainly in his role as party secretary that he serves as a member of Huawei\u2019s executive committee. As China is a Leninist state, it is the Communist party that ultimately controls all government agencies, state-owned companies and, probably, private companies where it has a formal presence. It seems highly likely that when it comes to strategic decisions, it is the party \u2013 via Mr Zhou \u2013 that controls Huawei. It beggars belief that the government does not understand the Communist party\u2019s decisive role in Huawei. Consequently, we must ask why it\u2019s planning to allow the company any role at all in Britain\u2019s 5G network. Is it because Brexit Britain will be in desperate need of any investment, including that controlled by the Chinese Communist party? Or is there something else going on? If this were a Labour government, the rightwing media would be telling us that Jeremy Corbyn was in the pay of China. But Theresa May? Surely not. Jeffrey Henderson Professor emeritus of international development, University of Bristol \u2022 The correct course (Ultimatum to ministers in Huawei leak investigation, 26 April) would be to suspend all five principal suspects until the investigation is completed. It\u2019s hardly as if the government\u2019s performance would suffer in consequence.

      "bodyText": "Cabinet members who were at Tuesday\u2019s National Security Council (NSC) have been sent an ultimatum by Whitehall\u2019s most powerful official to confess or deny whether they leaked a controversial decision to allow Chinese telecoms firm Huawei to help build the UK\u2019s 5G phone network. Cabinet secretary Sir Mark Sedwill is understood to have written to those present and demanded that they tell him by 2pm on Thursday whether they were involved and would be willing to cooperate with an inquiry, prompting the five prime suspects to scramble to \u201ccategorically deny\u201d that they were behind the leak. The move came at an acutely sensitive time as several of those present are hoping to take over as prime minister when Theresa May steps down. There are also growing calls for whoever did leak the information to the Daily Telegraph to be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act. Sedwill also asked the senior ministers present to agree that their special advisers, and any officials who had access to information about the outcome of the NSC meeting, would also assist the inquiry. The NSC meeting had decided to allow Huawei to supply some \u201cnon core\u201d telecoms equipment for next-generation phone networks in the UK and the initial focus over the leak has centred on the five ministers present who were opposed to Huawei\u2019s having any involvement in 5G. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, was the first to go public on Thursday in denying he was behind the leak, condemning it at a lunch of the parliamentary press gallery. He said it was was \u201cutterly appalling\u201d and said denied that he or any of his staff were involved. The leadership candidate added: \u201cI \u2013 as I think everyone here knows \u2013 have never leaked confidential cabinet discussions and I never will, so I don\u2019t want to comment further. But I do think it is a very, very bad day for our democratic processes.\u201d Shortly after, Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, released his own statement of denial. He said: \u201cNeither I nor any of my team have divulged information from the National Security Council.\u201d Sources close to Penny Mordaunt, the development secretary, then said she \u201ccategorically denied\u201d being involved in the leak \u2013 a statement that was echoed shortly after by allies of the trade secretary Liam Fox. Finally, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, and another leadership contender, denied being involved. He also said: \u201cFor any cabinet minister or any minister in the government to share sensitive information in the public domain is completely unacceptable and it should be looked at.\u201d Sedwill\u2019s inquiry began with a letter to the members of the NSC \u2013 a secret official body comprising the prime minister, nine cabinet members, spy chiefs and senior members of the armed forces. Phone and email records could be examined and people questioned if it develops further and even lead to a minister or aide being fired. Former cabinet secretary Gus O\u2019Donnell, who helped set up the NSC, said the leak was \u201cincredibly serious\u201d and a \u201ccomplete outrage\u201d. \u201cIf I were cabinet secretary and I thoroughly applaud what my successor Mark Sedwill has done is to say \u2018look, this is just beyond the pale\u2019 - this is really important for the country, these issues are massively important,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Former defence secretary Michael Fallon said on Thursday that Downing Street should call in the police and mount a \u201ca proper Scotland Yard investigation\u201d and Andrew Mitchell, the Tory MP for Sutton Coldfield, told the BBC\u2019s Newsnight that MI5 should be asked to help. No 10 reacted with anger and alarm after the Huawei decision was leaked. It follows a series of leaks from cabinet and other sensitive political meetings as May\u2019s authority has collapsed during the Brexit crisis, but none from the NSC. Insiders said it is a place where \u201cpoliticians, intelligence agencies and military chiefs are supposed to be able to discuss issues openly and informally\u201d, saying that the leak has eroded trust. Politicians present had been deadlocked at five apiece, with the decision only being made after what amounted to a casting vote from the prime minister. Those who spoke against the plan argued for a blanket ban on Huawei telecoms equipment. A public announcement of the decision had not been due for several weeks, after further work was undertaken on various additional safeguards, but the leak transformed the debate with several backbench Conservatives raising concerns on Wednesday and Thursday.The five ministers in favour of allowing Huawei to supply equipment to \u201cnon core\u201d parts of the network, such as antennas, were led by May but also included David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, Greg Clark, the business secretary, and Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary. It is understood that the final decision was in line with the advice from Britain\u2019s intelligence agencies, led by GCHQ\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, which already monitors Huawei technology in case of a backdoor that could be exploited by the Chinese government. The spy agency has repeatedly said Huawei must be monitored but that the risks can be contained. But politicians concerned about the company said the UK should heed warnings from US and Australian spy agencies, who share intelligence with the UK as part of the Five Eyes network. Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, told MPs: \u201cThis is fundamentally a diplomatic and political question, just as much as a technical one, and \u2026 respecting our Five Eyes partners is an essential part of the decision.\u201d Earlier Labour demanded \u201ca full leak inquiry\u201d in an urgent question in the House of Commons. Jo Platt, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said: \u201cIf a minister did leak this information they are not fit to serve in the cabinet and they are certainly not fit to be prime minister.\u201d In the debate that followed, Wright condemned the leak and signalled that a criminal investigation under the Official Secrets Act could yet go ahead. He told MPs \u201cI cannot rule it out\u201d, and added it was \u201ca matter for investigating and prosecuting authorities to consider\u201d. Hammond is in China to participate in an investment forum in Bejing.
