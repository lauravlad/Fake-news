      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has backed cross-party plans to delay a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson and prioritise rebel MPs\u2019 attempts to use legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit, with plans set to be agreed by the end of the week. In a meeting with opposition parties convened by the Labour leader, Corbyn opened the discussion by reassuring MPs that Labour would not seek a premature vote of no confidence that might stymie legislative efforts to stop no deal. But there could yet be a conflict over who should lead the push for legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit. Corbyn said he would \u201cpropose the parliamentary process which would mean the legislation can be laid\u201d, though other opposition MPs have made it clear they believe the moves must be led by backbenchers. Key opposition MPs will convene smaller meetings to discuss plans for legislation over the next 48 hours and party leaders hope to speak again by the end of the week, according to sources. MPs\u2019 efforts were given a fresh sense urgency on Tuesday evening as rumours swirled at Westminster that the privy council of senior ministers was preparing to meet the Queen at Balmoral this week, perhaps as soon as Wednesday. Leaked emails revealed at the weekend that the prime minister had sought legal advice about proroguing parliament for five weeks from early September, when MPs are already due to break briefly for party conferences. A new session of parliament would then begin with a fresh Queen\u2019s speech packed with manifesto-friendly measures on or around 14 October. Such a move would have to be approved by the privy council. It would give MPs little chance for parliamentary manoeuvring, but could just about allow time for a vote on any reworked deal Johnson manages to strike with the EU27, before the crucial European council meeting on October 17. One source suggested something like this timetable could be on the agenda at the privy council meeting. Speculation that Johnson could call an early general election was also heightened on Tuesday when the Treasury abruptly cancelled a major speech by the chancellor, Sajid Javid. Instead, the Treasury announced that the one-year spending review, setting out the government\u2019s economic priorities, is to be fast-tracked to 4 September \u2013 the day MPs return to parliament \u2013 in a sign that the government wants to highlight a new policy agenda before a potential autumn election. An agreement to focus efforts on passing legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit was made at Tuesday\u2019s meeting, attended by the Scottish National party\u2019s Ian Blackford, Jo Swinson of the Liberal Democrats, the Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Adam Price and Liz Saville Roberts and the Independent Group for Change\u2019s Anna Soubry. Speaking after the meeting, Corbyn said he would \u201cput forward a proposal which will make sure that parliament is able to debate a legislative way of preventing the government crashing us out with no deal \u2026 the legislation will be laid by people from all of the opposition parties and will be supported by some Conservative MPs as well.\u201d MPs are planning on using the same tactics as they did earlier this year when rebels seized control of the order paper and passed a bill led by Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin that mandated an extension to article 50. Moves are also planned to force the publication of damaging no-deal preparation documents to win public backing for efforts to prevent a no-deal departure, as well as other parliamentary manoeuvres to try to block any proposed prorogation of parliament. Parties also discussed opposing holding the regular parliamentary recess over the party conference period in late September, though a Labour source said nothing had been agreed. In a joint statement published by Labour after the meeting, which appeared to retreat from the party\u2019s initial offer to call a vote of no confidence and establish a caretaker government led by Corbyn, the party leaders said they \u201cagreed on the urgency to act together to find practical ways to prevent no deal, including the possibility of passing legislation and a vote of no confidence\u201d. The Labour leader insisted later that the option of a motion of no confidence remained on the table and could be explored simultaneously. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with whether people like me or not,\u201d he said. \u201cThe priority is to ensure we don\u2019t crash out of the EU. And we will put a motion of no confidence at a time of our choosing.\u201d Although Letwin, Dominic Grieve, and Caroline Spelman, all prominent Conservatives opposed to Brexit, were invited to the meeting, no Tory MPs attended. Corbyn had made an offer to opposition MPs that he would lead a caretaker government for a short period to negotiate an extension to article 50 and then call an immediate general election in which Labour would campaign on a platform of offering a second referendum. This has been rejected by the vast majority of Conservatives, as well as the Lib Dems. Rebel Conservatives and former Tories including Nick Boles, some of whom have been key movers in efforts to stop no deal, have insisted parliamentary legislation should be the focus. It is understood Soubry, a former Conservative MP, made a forceful case that legislation had to be a priority. Boles had said he was deeply concerned that Corbyn would attempt to trigger a no-confidence vote too early and wrote to the Labour leader urging him to \u201cdeclare publicly that you will not facilitate an election before an extension of article 50 has been secured and a no-deal Brexit has been averted\u201d. After the meeting, Corbyn wrote to 116 backbench Conservative and independent MPs including Theresa May, Philip Hammond, David Lidington and Greg Clark, urging them to back the cross-party efforts against no deal. Labour said it had highlighted MPs who had voted against no deal on 27 March when voting for an extension to article 50. \u201cWe know there is a majority in parliament against no deal,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am writing to you to offer to work together, in a collegiate, cross-party spirit, to find a practical way to prevent no deal.\u201d Soubry said there was \u201cno debate\u201d that the legislative route was the best way forward. \u201cA vote of no confidence is absolutely the last resort.

Second, that it has cross-party support (although its members will not be politicians).

It is obviously right that among many others the churches should contribute to the emergence of a dynamic and united country post-Brexit, however it may be achieved. Every one of us must play the part they can in this task.</p> \n   <p>The need for national healing and eventually for a move towards reconciliation is essential, and will take much time, a deep commitment to the common good, and contributions from every source. This forum is only one of many different efforts being made inside the political world and across the country before and after Brexit. Every effort counts.</p> \n   <p>Let us pray for all those in government, parliament and political leadership.

      "bodyText": "A confidential government briefing paper leaked to the Guardian has revealed a raft of dramatic and controversial education measures including billions of pounds in new funding, a crackdown on student behaviour and a further wave of free schools. The proposals were designed to be rolled out over the coming weeks in a bid to seize the initiative on education ahead of a possible autumn election. Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to work with oppositions leaders to prioritise opposing a no-deal Brexit using legislation, with a no-confidence vote in the government reserved as a last resort. The Westminster leaders of the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Independent Group for Change attended a meeting along with the shadow chancellor John McDonnell on Tuesday, at which they agreed to form an alternative parliament in the event of the prime minister shutting down the existing one to make a no-deal Brexit happen. The first major speech by the chancellor Sajid Javid has been mysteriously cancelled by the Treasury less than 24 hours before it was due to take place. A Treasury spokesman said that the one-year spending review, called a spending round, which had been due to take place later this year, was now being fast-tracked to take place in early September, adding fuel to speculation the government could be planning an early general election. Nigel Farage has said the Brexit party may be prepared to work with the Conservatives through a \u201cnon-aggression pact\u201d if the only way of achieving a \u201cclean-break\u201d Brexit was a general election. The archbishop of Canterbury has agreed in principle to chair a citizens\u2019 assembly on Brexit despite provoking outrage from Eurosceptics for considering the idea. Acknowledging the controversy of such a role, Justin Welby said he would only take part if the exercise were not aimed at thwarting Brexit. He also suggested it could be conducted after the UK had left the European Union as a way of overcoming divisions. That\u2019s it from us today. Thanks very much for reading. My colleagues Aditya Chakrabortty, Richard Adams and Sally Weale have just published an exclusive detailing a raft of dramatic and controversial education policy proposals set out in a confidential briefing paper. The measures include billions of pounds in new funding, a crackdown on student behaviour and a further wave of free schools, which are set to be announced by the government within days. The briefing document, dated 22 August and marked \u201cOfficial-Sensitive\u201d, details a blizzard of policy proposals designed to be rolled out over the coming weeks in a bid to seize the initiative on education ahead of a possible autumn election. While proposals including a \u00a33.5bn funding announcement and plans to increase teachers\u2019 basic pay may be broadly welcomed, there will be concern in some quarters over a package of disciplinary measures that include a renewed emphasis on exclusions and allowing teachers to use \u201creasonable force\u201d to improve behaviour. Read the full story here - Jonathan Lis, deputy director of the thinktank British Influence, has written for our opinion pages welcoming today\u2019s opposition talks. Today\u2019s meeting is highly significant for two reasons. First, it demonstrates that, when push comes to shove, politicians who may personally dislike or distrust each other can sit around a table and work seriously, cordially and productively. Second, and more importantly, it highlights that MPs have the means at their disposal to stop no deal. They already had the numbers. Now they are showing the willing. The Conservative party has tweeted accusing opposition politicians of \u201cplotting to cancel the votes of 17.4 million people\u201d. Change UK leader, Anna Soubry, who was a Tory MP until February this year, said the message was yet more proof that \u201cright wing ideologues\u201d had taken over her old party. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has responded to an invitation from MPs to chair a \u201ccitizens\u2019 forum on Brexit\u201d in which alternatives to a no deal would be discussed. He has issued a statement on his website: It is an unexpected privilege to be asked to chair this proposed citizens\u2019 forum on Brexit. In the past this kind of gathering has, in many places and in difficult situations, opened the way for careful deliberation if at the right time and genuinely representative. I am honoured to be approached and would be willing to accept in principle, subject to some conditions which have not yet been met. The main three are first, and indispensably, that the forum should not be a Trojan horse intended to delay or prevent Brexit in any particular form. That power can only be exercised by the government and MPs in parliament. A forum must be open to all possibilities. Second, that it has cross-party support (although its members will not be politicians). Third, the process must have time to be properly organised. Jesus Christ is the source of reconciliation and healing for individuals and society. It is obviously right that among many others the churches should contribute to the emergence of a dynamic and united country post-Brexit, however it may be achieved. Every one of us must play the part they can in this task. The need for national healing and eventually for a move towards reconciliation is essential, and will take much time, a deep commitment to the common good, and contributions from every source. This forum is only one of many different efforts being made inside the political world and across the country before and after Brexit. Every effort counts. Let us pray for all those in government, parliament and political leadership. Let us pray for the people of this country whose lives will be affected in many ways by the momentous decisions that are made. Responding to earlier reports that Welby had met with MPs to discuss hosting a possible citizens\u2019 assembly, the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: I generally don\u2019t criticise the archbishop but he shouldn\u2019t allow himself to be tempted into what is essentially a very political issue right now. This assembly is designed to destabilise Boris Johnson\u2019s position. As such I hope he will recognise the deeply political nature of this. Jeremy Corbyn was not at today\u2019s meeting of opposition leaders at Church House \u2013 the shadow chancellor said he was busy in meetings \u2013 but the Labour leader has spoken to broadcast media this afternoon. Labour\u2019s John McDonnell has responded to the announcement that the first major speech by the new chancellor, Sajid Javid, has been cancelled less than 24 hours before it was due to take place. Sajid Javid is getting a record of announcing events and initiatives, and then within hours cancelling or reversing them. This doesn\u2019t inspire confidence. Panic seems to be setting in inside government. Dear readers, it\u2019s been fun but it\u2019s time to hand over the live blogging reins to my colleague Frances Perraudin (Twitter @fperraudin). She\u2019ll bring you the latest Brexit developments until close of play. Have a peaceful evening and thank you for your questions and comments. Our reporter Ben Quinn attended a symbolic meeting of MPs in Church House where they discussed their opposition to no-deal Brexit. He filed this report. Boris Johnson was described as a threat to the very nature of British democracy at a cross party meeting of MPs who signed a pledge to an alternative parliament in the event of the prime minister shutting down parliament to make a no deal Brexit happen. In a highly symbolic gathering in Church House, where MPs met during the second world war, Labour\u2019s John McDonnell took to the stage alongside the former Conservative MP, Anna Soubry, as well as the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson and Caroline Lucas of the Green Party. Each one signed the \u2018Church House Declaration,\u2019 which declared that shutting down parliament would be \u201can undemocratic outrage at such a crucial moment for our country, and a historic constitutional crisis.\u201d It added: \u201cAny attempt to prevent Parliament sitting, to force through a no deal Brexit, will be met by strong and widespread democratic resistance.\u201d The shadow chancellor, who said that Jeremy Corbyn had been trapped in meetings, told those assembled: \u201cPrime Ministers come and Prime Ministers go but I don\u2019t think we have seen a Prime Minister like this who has had the potential to threaten the vary nature of our democracy.\u201d I want to warn him that we will not and let that happen, said McDonnell, who added that MPs will use \u201cwhatever mechanism necessary\u201d to thwart Johnson. More than 160 MPs from a range of parties were said by organisers to have signed the declaration. Ian Blackford, the leader of the SNP in the House of Commons, said that the government posed a threat to the security of citizens, while the Green MP Caroline Lucas said: \u201cWe will block what is nothing less than a coup.\u201d Swinson said that members of parliament had come together to make the point that they would not stand by while the government sent the country into a \u201ccatastrophic no deal Brexit.\u201d While Conservative MPs were conspicuous by their absence from the event, there was a highly symbolic moment when the former Tory MP and minister addressed the event, standing on stage while McDonnell sat beside her. She said that she hoped that when the history books were written they would record their determination and courage and show that there were those who acted while others stood by and did nothing. \u201cYou all know who the people of courage are and those who have failed to exercise it. They will stop you in the corridors and say: \u2018of course this is absolute madness\u2019 but they will not go and do the right thing, which is to be true to their principles.\u201d The Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn has written to 116 Tory MPs, including former prime minister Theresa May, Philip Hammond, David Gauke and Greg Clark, urging them to support cross-party efforts to stop no-deal Brexit. Here\u2019s the full text of the letter: Dear colleague, I am writing to you after convening a meeting earlier today with the leaders of other opposition parties on how we can work together, across Parliament to prevent a damaging No Deal exit from the European Union. At that meeting, we agreed to make efforts to put party politics aside to find a way through the present crisis. We know there is a majority in parliament against No Deal. As MPs we\u2019ve voted against No Deal on a number of occasions and we did so in the largest number on 27 March of this year. As you were one of 116 Conservative or independent MPs who voted against No Deal that day and are not on the government frontbench, I am writing to you to offer to work together, in a collegiate, cross party spirit, to find a practical way to prevent No Deal. This is an urgent task. The Prime Minister is reportedly planning to suspend parliament to force through a No Deal crash out. This action would be, according to legal advice I\u2019ve received from Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti, \u201cthe gravest abuse of power and attack upon UK constitutional principle in living memory\u201d. My view is that holding a general election after an extension is achieved is the simplest and most democratic way to prevent No Deal and to let the people of this country decide our future. Indeed, it is the best route to a referendum or leaving the EU with a deal. I understand not all colleagues may agree. So I would like to invite you to join a dialogue with myself, as leader of the Labour Party, and other opposition parties, to find a way for the clear will of parliament against No Deal to express itself. Please respond by email. Yours sincerely, Jeremy Corbyn This from our chief political correspondent Jessica Elgot on Sajid Javid\u2019s cancelled speech. The chancellor has been meeting Trump\u2019s treasury secretary on Tuesday. The first major speech by the chancellor Sajid Javid has been mysteriously cancelled by the Treasury less than 24 hours before it was due to take place. A Treasury spokesman said that the one-year spending review, called a spending round, which had been due to take place later this year, was now being fast-tracked to take place in early September, adding fuel to speculation the government could be planning an early general election. The speech, which was due to take place in Birmingham, was billed as Javid \u201coutlining his vision for the UK economy.\u201d In an email to attendees, the Treasury press office said the speech was being rescheduled but gave no other reasoning. \u201cThe forthcoming Spending Round will instead be brought forward in early September and will cover the themes and priorities he was due to outline,\u201d the email said. Just in case you were wondering what the former prime minister is up to today... Our Ben Quinn has escaped the Brexit party rally and is at Church House to watch MPs pledge to form an alternative parliament if Boris Johnson shuts down the Commons to make a no-deal Brexit happen. MPs who are working together to oppose no-deal Brexit are about to issue a joint statement to the media. We\u2019ve set up a live stream of the event but you might want to give it a couple of minutes. It\u2019s currently a video of John McDonnell telling Keir Starmer about pruning his hedge. I\u2019ll let you know when they get started. Here\u2019s how the lawyer and writer David Allen Green reads today\u2019s developments: Caroline Lucas is the latest anti-Brexit MP to say the meeting at Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office was a success. But No 10 are not happy, according to the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley. The prime minister\u2019s press team are probably sick to the back teeth of finding new ways to say it, but Boris Johnson\u2019s Twitter account has sent out a useful lunchtime reminder about his government\u2019s Brexit policy. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has told the BBC\u2019s World at One programme that the meeting in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office with other leaders trying to stop no-deal Brexit was \u201cvery positive\u201d. Swinson confirmed that the leaders did not discuss who would lead a caretaker government if the prime minister lost a vote of no confidence She told the show: What is clear is there is a real sense of urgency. We don\u2019t have time to lose. We are very much looking to act as soon as possible. So it looks a September battle for Brexit in parliament has been confirmed, with the nuclear option of a no confidence vote reserved for early October. Sir Oliver Letwin and other policy mavericks will need to rev up their legislative Spitfires for one last go at seeing off a no-deal Brexit. Here\u2019s a summary of today\u2019s developments: Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to work with oppositions leaders to prioritise opposing a no-deal Brexit using legislation, with a no-confidence vote in the government reserved as a last resort. The leaders of the Labour Party, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Independent Group for Change have all agreed to meet again to discuss how to stop the UK crashing out of the European Union on October 31. Boris Johnson and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker will speak on the phone on Tuesday afternoon to touch base after the G7. The call follows a conversation between the Dutch leader Mark Rutte and the prime minister in which he said the EU27 remained open to new proposals from the UK government. Nigel Farage has said the Brexit party may be prepared to work with the Conservatives through a \u201cnon-aggression pact\u201d if the only way of achieving a \u201cclean-break\u201d Brexit was a general election at a pre-election rally. The archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has been criticised by Brexiters for reportedly meeting MPs with a view to chairing citizens\u2019 assemblies to stop a no-deal departure from the EU. A joint statement has been issued by the Labour party, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Green party and the Independent Group for Change following this morning\u2019s meeting. They have all agreed to meet again. The leaders of the opposition parties held a productive and detailed meeting on stopping a disastrous no-deal exit from the EU. Jeremy Corbyn outlined the legal advice he has received from shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, which calls Boris Johnson\u2019s plans to suspend parliament to force through a no deal \u201cthe gravest abuse of power and attack upon UK constitutional principle in living memory\u201d. The attendees agreed that Boris Johnson has shown himself open to using anti-democratic means to force through no deal. The attendees agreed on the urgency to act together to find practical ways to prevent no deal, including the possibility of passing legislation and a vote of no confidence. The party leaders agreed to further meetings. A quick reminder: please refresh the page from time to time. I\u2019m backfilling and updating posts as I go. Our reporter Ben Quinn attended the Brexit party election rally this morning and he\u2019s filed this report. The Brexit party may be prepared to work with the Conservatives through a \u201cnon-aggression pact\u201d if the only way of achieving a \u201cclean-break\u201d Brexit was a general election, Nigel Farage has said. Seeking to put clear blue water between his party and the new Brexiter-dominated government, Farage reminded a rally near Westminster that Boris Johnson had voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal with Brussels on the the third occasion it came before MPs. \u201cThat raises a very big question. Can you trust Boris Johnson on this question,\u201d he told more than 500 of the Brexit party\u2019s prospective parliamentary candidates. He also railed against the \u201cglobalists\u201d in the Labour party and evoked loud boos at the mention of Jeremy Corbyn and the the Scottish National party. Farage said the backstop \u2013 the device intended to ensure there would be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland \u2013 was \u201cthe worst deal in history\u201d \u201cMr Johnson, if you insisted on leaving with the withdrawal agreement we will fight you in every single seat the length and breadth of Britain,\u201d he added, to roars of approval. However, Farage also sketched out another scenario, one in which he said the prime minister \u201cwas to summon up the courage\u201d to proceed with a no-deal Brexit on 31 October but where the only means of achieving it was to call a general election. \u201cIn those circumstances, if Boris Johnson is prepared to do the right thing to win out independence then we are prepared to do the right thing,\u201d he added, before his words were drowned out. Farage said the Brexit party might then be prepared to work with him, \u201cperhaps in the form of a non-aggression pact\u201d. This from our chief political correspondent Jessica Elgot. ITV\u2019s Daniel Hewitt reports the meeting between Jeremy Corbyn and opposition leaders went on for an hour and a quarter. Our Jessica Elgot points out that Corbyn\u2019s apparent agreement to prioritise legislation over a vote of no confidence is a crucial commitment for Tories reluctant to back the government on crashing out of the EU. I\u2019m afraid this signals the end of talk about who would make the best temporary prime minister. For now, at least. Right, they\u2019re out of Corbyn\u2019s office and it sounds like the meeting went well. All parties have agreed to make stopping no-deal Brexit with legislation the priority. We\u2019ll bring you more when we have it. We\u2019re getting some more details on that planned phone call between Boris Johnson and Jean-Claude Juncker later today. A European Commission confirmed that the pair would touch base after G7 discussions while the prime minister\u2019 sherpa and EU adviser David Frost would also hold meetings in the commission on Wednesday. She said: More generally, I think we have been saying that we stand ready to, of course, engage constructively with the UK on any concrete proposals that are compatible with the Withdrawal Agreement, so this is exactly in the spirit of constructiveness and engagement that the two will speak later in the afternoon. Indeed I can confirm that he will have meetings in the commission tomorrow, for now we are finalising the schedule. There will clearly be a meeting with the task force 50 at technical level, but there are probably also other meetings following so, as the agenda is developing, more meetings could be added. A crucial development from Farage\u2019s rally: the Brexit party would form a \u201cnon-aggression pact\u201d with the Conservatives if the prime minister pursues a no-deal Brexit. Farage told the audience: If Boris Johnson is prepared to do the right thing for the independence of this country, then we would put country before party and do the right thing. We would be prepared to work with him, perhaps in the form of a non-aggression pact at the general election. The Conservative party has lost so much trust that the only way they could win a general election is with our support. I imagine the cups of tea have been poured and the digestives have been passed round at the meeting in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office with party leaders opposed to a no-deal Brexit. While we wait, take a read of my colleague Jessica Elgot\u2019s explainer on what the key players want. Here\u2019s an extract on the Lib Dems, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens: The Lib Dems The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, sparked a row with Labour earlier this month when she argued that if he won a vote of no confidence, Corbyn should be willing to cede the leadership of any caretaker government to another senior politician. On Sunday, the shadow trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, accused Swinson of being petulant. There may be a background question of self-interest however \u2013 Lib Dems would stand to gain significantly from a snap election, while the Brexit question still hangs in the balance or while remainers feel betrayed by no deal, and the wind may have gone out of their sails if an election is held later rather than sooner. The SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens The Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, has said she would back Corbyn as an interim prime minister and said other MPs and parties must be realistic when it comes to the trade-offs needed to stop no deal. The SNP has also confirmed it would back Corbyn in a no-confidence vote against the prime minister, though the party\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, was non-committal as to whether his party would back a caretaker Corbyn government. Like the Lib Dems, polling indicates, the party could fare well in a snap election. Plaid Cymru\u2019s leader, Adam Price, has said his party is \u201cprepared to consider supporting Jeremy Corbyn as a potential leader of a caretaker government if that is the means by which we can avoid the disaster of a no-deal Brexit\u201d. But Price said support could be conditional on Labour committing to campaigning for a remain vote in a second referendum. It turns out Boris Johnson\u2019s conversation with the Dutch leader, Mark Rutte, has taken place much earlier than expected. Rutte said the EU27 remained open to new proposals from the UK government that were compatible with the withdrawal agreement, but they must respect the single market and not necessitate a hard border in Ireland. Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, has started a five-city Brexit tour of EU capitals to reinforce the importance of backstop and Good Friday agreement for economic and social stability in Ireland. His message flies in the face of claims that the EU has been showing the first signs of bending on the backstop after Boris Johnson\u2019s first appearance at a G7 summit in Biarritz at the weekend. Commenting in Dublin before the trip and before a meeting with his Norwegian counterpart on Monday night, Coveney spoke of a diplomatic outreach programme to help other nations understand the \u201cunique\u201d impact of Brexit on the island of Ireland. He also said \u201cthe complex constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland, the experiences of border communities in the past, and the interwoven nature of relationships on the island can be best understood by a visit to the area\u201d. Coveney is expected to repeat this message in Prague today, in Paris on Wednesday, in Helsinki on Thursday and Friday and in Warsaw on Sunday. Last week in Dublin, Coveney said it was not the case that the Irish government was refusing to talk to the UK, but said he would not be facilitating the UK in walking away from commitments in the withdrawal agreement. The Brexit party leader\u2019s abrasive speech ends with a simple message for the government and opposition parties: \u201cWe are ready.\u201d In another Trumpian flourish, Farage criticises Labour as a \u201cremain, second referendum party\u201d, calling on Brexit-supporting Labour voters in south Wales, the Midlands and the north to join the Brexit party. Labour has become the reserve of \u201cupper middle class globalists\u201d who have \u201clost touch with their patriotic roots\u201d, according to Farage. Farage is still going on the withdrawal agreement, warning the prime minister that the Brexit party will fight the Conservatives in \u201cevery single seat up and down the country\u201d if he tries to revive Theresa May\u2019s deal. The former Ukip leader tells Johnson to deliver a \u201cclean break Brexit\u201d or \u201cpolitically die\u201d. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, starts by criticising the prime minister for \u201cgoing off the rails\u201d, questioning whether the public should trust Boris Johnson on Brexit. Farage then spends a long time attacking the withdrawal agreement with the EU, calling it the \u201cworst deal in history\u201d even without the backstop. A quick \u201cBrexit means breakfast\u201d update: the Brexit party chairman, Richard Tice, stumbles as he introduces Nigel Farage, asking parliamentary candidates to welcome \u201cthe person who has fought for breakfast \u2026 for Brexit\u201d. It happens to even the most ardent Brexiteers \u2026 Farage is addressing the audience now. I\u2019ll bring you the most important clips. Again, you can follow along here: The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, is feeling well enough after emergency gallbladder surgery to speak to Boris Johnson on the phone this afternoon. The prime minister will also speak with the Dutch leader, Mark Rutte, this evening, according to our Jennifer Rankin. The Brexit party is currently unveiling hundreds of parliamentary candidates in Westminster, with its leader, Nigel Farage, expected to give a speech shortly. You can follow the event using the link below \u2013 the chairman, Richard Tice, is telling candidates they are \u201cmore ready\u201d than any other party. Supporting the prime minister in calling a general election, even if the vote took place just days before the Brexit deadline, is one option the Labour leadership would support to avoid a no deal, reports our political editor Heather Stewart. The Labour leader\u2019s team are convinced a no-deal Brexit could be thwarted by securing an extension from Britain\u2019s EU partners, even after the European council meets on 17 October. Johnson is widely believed to be plotting a snap poll if MPs try to thwart his Brexit plans \u2013 by passing legislation forcing him to ask for an extension to article 50, for example. However, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the prime minister would need a two-thirds majority to call a general election before the next one is due in 2022. But the Brexit position of the Labour party if a general election were to take place is still unclear. During the media rounds this morning, Keir Starmer said Labour was the party of remain, would put any Brexit deal to a referendum and in that referendum would campaign for remain. Away from the Westminster spotlight, the North Norfolk MP, Sir Norman Lamb, has told the Eastern Daily Press he will not stand at the next election so he can focus on improving mental health care in the country. The former health minister told the newspaper parliament had become paralysed by Brexit and he felt he could do more good outside Westminster. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, is finishing up a morning of TV and radio interviews with a clear message for party leaders preparing to meet in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office in a couple of hours: unite around one plan. Let\u2019s try and put our tribal differences on one side because what we\u2019ve got to do, very effectively, is have one plan that is going to work to prevent no-deal Brexit and we\u2019ve got to implement it next week. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has reiterated her belief that Jeremy Corbyn is not the right choice as temporary prime minister to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Swinson told BBC Radio Scotland that she would consider supporting a senior Labour politician who did not hold the long-term ambition of being prime minister. Here are the full quotes: If there are others, I am open to hearing others \u2026 Anybody that could command a majority in the House of Commons to avoid us crashing out without a deal if the legislative approach, which I think is the strongest and best way forward, if that doesn\u2019t work. [Jeremy Corbyn] knows he doesn\u2019t have the numbers. He says he\u2019s serious about wanting to stop no deal, and, taking him at his word, I presume that means that he would be prepared to put forward that vote of no confidence and then, if we are in that scenario of having an emergency government, unite behind somebody who can command support right across the house. He might have suggestions for who that person could be and it could be a senior Labour politician at the end of their career who doesn\u2019t have that long-term ambition of being prime minister, because I think the house is more likely to support someone in that emergency scenario than somebody who actually wants to be prime minister and is currently leading a political party. Opposition leaders are flexing their political muscles ahead of the meeting in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office. The Labour leader says crashing out of the bloc after Halloween would put the UK at the mercy of US corporations looking for NHS contracts. Meanwhile, the SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has repeated his call to use an emergency debate to block no deal. How could opposition leaders pursue this line of attack? Here\u2019s what the UK parliament website has to say: An MP may apply to the Speaker for an emergency debate on Mondays to Thursdays during sitting time under the rules of standing order No 24. If the Speaker has given the MP leave they will have three minutes to make a speech after question time and any urgent questions or ministerial statements. The Speaker then decides whether to submit the application to the house. The house will have to agree that the debate takes place. If the house agrees to the application the emergency debate will take place on a future day, usually the next sitting day. The motion to be debated will be \u201cThat the house has considered the matter of [topic]\u201d. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian politics live blog. I am deputising for Andrew today \u2013 hoping to be the Rebecca Long-Bailey of the live blogging scene while he takes some well-earned time off. Boris Johnson is back in Downing Street after a weekend in the south of France at the G7, but the big story in Westminster on Tuesday will be a meeting between opposition leaders hoping to stop a no-deal Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn is expected to host Caroline Lucas, Anna Soubry, Jo Swinson, Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts in his office around noon to discuss how parliament might stop the UK crashing out of the European Union after the 31 October deadline. Conservative MPs who oppose a no-deal Brexit are not expected to attend. Corbyn promised to do everything in his power to stop a \u201cno-deal bankers\u2019 Brexit\u201d in an opinion piece for the Independent ahead of the meeting. The Labour leader left all options on the table. We want an injection of democracy so the people can decide our country\u2019s future. That could come either by Johnson having the courage of his convictions to test his no-deal plans in a final say referendum or through a general election. In that election, Labour would offer a referendum, with a credible leave option as well as the option to remain. Labour believes the decision on how to resolve the Brexit crisis must now go back to the people to have legitimacy. But we won\u2019t rule out other options, such as passing legislation, that could stop this no-deal disaster in its tracks. I\u2019ll discuss all these options with the leaders of other opposition parties on Tuesday. I hope we can come to a good working arrangement and bring on board others across parliament who see the danger of a no-deal crash out. Forcing a no-deal Brexit by shutting down parliament would be the \u201cgravest abuse of power and attack on UK constitutional principle in living memory\u201d, according to new legal advice obtained by Labour. Our Heather Stewart and Rowena Mason have the full story. I will be covering breaking political news as it happens while curating the best comment and analysis from the web.

      "body": "<p>Arise, Lord Tim of Wetherspoon\u2019s. Try on this ermine for size, any economist prepared to go against almost the entirety of your profession in arguing that a no-deal Brexit would be just terrific for Britain.</p> <p>The prime minister is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/26/boris-johnson-to-send-tory-loyalists-to-house-of-lords\" title=\"\">drawing up a list</a> of so-called <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1170329/Brexit-news-boris-johnson-house-of-lords-brexiteers\" title=\"\">\u201cBrexit heroes\u201d</a> to be rewarded with peerages, although the word \u201chero\u201d here is arguably being stretched to breaking point: the plan is apparently to ennoble a bunch of leading leavers after 31 October, in a clear rebuke to a House of Lords that has so far proved decidedly sceptical about the idea of leaving the EU at any price. Well done, everyone involved in dragging Britain into this godawful mess! Now here\u2019s your reward: the chance to get a whole new set of life-changing political judgments wrong, for generations to come.</p> <p>Prime ministers packing the House of Lords with their own supporters is not exactly new, obviously \u2013 and if you don\u2019t complain when your own side does it, then it\u2019s hypocritical to complain when the other side does. After all, Theresa May\u2019s own resignation honours list is expected to include the likes of her former chief of staff Gavin Barwell, who fought tirelessly behind the scenes for a more moderate Brexit and would be free to continue in the Lords with the gloves off. It\u2019s only natural that Boris Johnson would retaliate in kind, stuffing a few no-deal enthusiasts on to those increasingly crowded red leather benches ahead of the battles to come (for even if we do leave the EU as promised on 31 October, that will only be only the start of years of haggling over the future relationship). If the names now doing the rounds seem hopelessly underqualified to make law, then the same is true of countless honours lists past padded out with party donors or nondescript MPs being bumped up to the Lords so some favoured political protege could have their Commons seats.</p> <p>But step back, and the overall picture emerging across public life is alarming. Johnson is rapidly correcting what many leavers see as the great strategic error of the last three years, which was to win the referendum battle but not the ensuing war. They got their popular mandate to leave, but never secured control of the political establishment charged with carrying it out.</p> <p>Parliament may be cowed and confused, afraid of confronting the 52%, but deep down it\u2019s never been convinced by hard Brexiters\u2019 arguments (and Tory peers, who unlike Tory MPs, have nothing to fear from an increasingly radicalised grass roots membership, have proved particularly hard to keep in line). Downing Street under May was full of former remainers, and while civil servants have done their level best to serve their masters with the requisite political neutrality, it\u2019s not really neutrality the Johnson administration seeks now but the kind of gung-ho evangelical belief that finds a way through, regardless of the practical obstacles.</p> <p>Ordinarily, the fact that a no-deal Brexit unites this many smart and politically experienced Westminster people in a horror that transcends party lines would be seen as a giant, flashing red light.

      "bodyText": "Arise, Lord Tim of Wetherspoon\u2019s. Try on this ermine for size, any economist prepared to go against almost the entirety of your profession in arguing that a no-deal Brexit would be just terrific for Britain. The prime minister is reportedly drawing up a list of so-called \u201cBrexit heroes\u201d to be rewarded with peerages, although the word \u201chero\u201d here is arguably being stretched to breaking point: the plan is apparently to ennoble a bunch of leading leavers after 31 October, in a clear rebuke to a House of Lords that has so far proved decidedly sceptical about the idea of leaving the EU at any price. Well done, everyone involved in dragging Britain into this godawful mess! Now here\u2019s your reward: the chance to get a whole new set of life-changing political judgments wrong, for generations to come. Prime ministers packing the House of Lords with their own supporters is not exactly new, obviously \u2013 and if you don\u2019t complain when your own side does it, then it\u2019s hypocritical to complain when the other side does. After all, Theresa May\u2019s own resignation honours list is expected to include the likes of her former chief of staff Gavin Barwell, who fought tirelessly behind the scenes for a more moderate Brexit and would be free to continue in the Lords with the gloves off. It\u2019s only natural that Boris Johnson would retaliate in kind, stuffing a few no-deal enthusiasts on to those increasingly crowded red leather benches ahead of the battles to come (for even if we do leave the EU as promised on 31 October, that will only be only the start of years of haggling over the future relationship). If the names now doing the rounds seem hopelessly underqualified to make law, then the same is true of countless honours lists past padded out with party donors or nondescript MPs being bumped up to the Lords so some favoured political protege could have their Commons seats. But step back, and the overall picture emerging across public life is alarming. Johnson is rapidly correcting what many leavers see as the great strategic error of the last three years, which was to win the referendum battle but not the ensuing war. They got their popular mandate to leave, but never secured control of the political establishment charged with carrying it out. Parliament may be cowed and confused, afraid of confronting the 52%, but deep down it\u2019s never been convinced by hard Brexiters\u2019 arguments (and Tory peers, who unlike Tory MPs, have nothing to fear from an increasingly radicalised grass roots membership, have proved particularly hard to keep in line). Downing Street under May was full of former remainers, and while civil servants have done their level best to serve their masters with the requisite political neutrality, it\u2019s not really neutrality the Johnson administration seeks now but the kind of gung-ho evangelical belief that finds a way through, regardless of the practical obstacles. Ordinarily, the fact that a no-deal Brexit unites this many smart and politically experienced Westminster people in a horror that transcends party lines would be seen as a giant, flashing red light. If the consensus is that an idea is barking mad, then the chances are it is. But the twisted logic of populism turns all that upside down, arguing that if \u201cthe establishment\u201d is against something then it must be the establishment that needs changing, not the strategy. Hence the virtual takeover of No 10 by former Vote Leave staffers, led by Dominic Cummings, and emerging concerns within Whitehall that a more widespread politicisation of the civil service may now be on the cards. Some senior Tories have been arguing for years for a more activist, ideologically minded Whitehall machine that could help ministers drive through ideas that have popular support. Well, they\u2019ll never have a better chance to secure it. What makes all this so ominous is that these would be permanent changes. Regimes in Downing Street come and go, but peers are peers for life, retaining the ability to shape the country\u2019s future long after Brexit is either done and dusted (or, less likely, shelved for good). Civil service impartiality is rather like virginity in that once it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone for good. And the way Conservative membership associations handle deselection threats against rebellious remainer MPs will reverberate through parliament for years to come; it\u2019s not just about who survives the cull, but about who would choose to try to become an MP in the current climate and who would walk away. Whatever the outcome of the daily fight over Brexit, it may have permanently changed the conditions under which future battles will be fought \u2013 and not for the better. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",
