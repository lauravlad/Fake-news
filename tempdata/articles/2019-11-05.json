class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The UK and European Union face \u201ca moment of truth\u201d in post-Brexit trade talks next summer, <strong>Michel Barnier</strong> has said.</p> \n  <p>In a sign that he does not share Boris Johnson\u2019s confidence that no extension of the Brexit transition period is needed (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/05/general-election-news-latest-corbyn-brexit-speech-gove-says-labours-claim-uk-us-trade-deal-cost-cost-nhs-500m-per-week-nonsense-live-news?page=with:block-5dc13b0e8f085a89fec045b0#block-5dc13b0e8f085a89fec045b0\">9.45am)</a>, Barnier warned that the risk of a no-deal \u201ccliff edge\u201d remained. </p> \n  <p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal on 31 January, only 11 months remain of the post-Brexit transition, a period when the UK will remain in the EU single market and customs union, without having any say over decisions. </p> \n  <p>The government has the choice to seek a one-off extension of the transition until the end of 2021 or 2022, but must agree any extension with the EU by 1 July 2020.</p> \n  <p>The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said on Monday that the UK would not extend the transition period. Barnier, who has seen the UK extend withdrawal negotiations three times, sounded unconvinced: \u201cSummer 2020 will be a moment of truth in how far we have come and whether an extension will be needed,\u201d he told a tech conference in Lisbon on Tuesday.</p> \n  <p>Recently rehired by Brussels to lead talks on the future relationship with the UK, Barnier also issued a reminder that the current withdrawal agreement was \u201ca necessary step\u201d but not the \u201cfinal destination\u201d. Approval of the Brexit withdrawal deal by the UK parliament is the prelude to years more negotiations on a free trade agreement and foreign policy links. \u201cAs long as we have not completed both negotiations [the withdrawal agreement and future talks] with the UK, the risk of a cliff edge remains and we should all remain vigilant,\u201d Barnier said.</p> \n  <p>Reiterating what he told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/29/michel-barnier-tells-uk-ignore-eu-regulatory-standards-at-your-peril\">the Guardian and other European newspapers last week</a>, he said the EU would not compromise its environmental, social and economic standards in exchange for a free trade deal.</p> \n  <p>He stressed that an agreement on zero quotas and zero tariffs on trade would be linked to respecting EU norms on the environment, worker protections and state aid, in order to maintain a level playing field between EU and British companies. \u201cThe EU will not tolerate unfair competitive advantage.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He predicted the negotiations would be \u201cdifficult and demanding\u201d because the time is \u201cextremely short\u201d and because the UK \u201cmight want to diverge from EU rules\u201d.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c22ac7fd9b65c11d33bd9ab9a158316f4cc6701\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c22ac7fd9b65c11d33bd9ab9a158316f4cc6701/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michel Barnier speaking during the Web Summit in Lisbon today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michel Barnier speaking during the Web Summit in Lisbon today.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rafael Marchante/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-05T14:09:58.158Z\">at 2.09pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc169058f08c2d1f80d9f9d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-05T13:16:26.361Z\">1.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Corbyn's speech and Q&amp;A - Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some Tories have been assuming that Brexit will work best for them, not Labour, as an election issue. There are many voters, including people who voted remain, who are desperate for this to disappear as a problem facing the country, and in No 10 there was an assumption that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s stance - promising to a second referendum, but refusing now to say how he would campaign in it - would prove a liability.</p> \n  <p>But it did not particularly look like that this morning. Rather than duck Brexit as an issue, Corbyn this morning sought to switch it into a campaign positive for him, particular with his claim about how he could actually put it to bed as an issue more quickly than Boris Johnson.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn claimed that Labour would resolve the Brexit crisis facing the UK more quickly than Boris Johnson - because Johnson would spend years negotiating trade deals, while Labour wouldn\u2019t.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/05/general-election-news-latest-corbyn-brexit-speech-gove-says-labours-claim-uk-us-trade-deal-cost-cost-nhs-500m-per-week-nonsense-live-news?page=with:block-5dc15d8f8f084b2b11b879b3#block-5dc15d8f8f084b2b11b879b3\">11.34am.)</a> This involved an implicit admission that, under a Labour soft Brexit, the UK would not be negotiating its own trade deals because it would be working on them in conjunction with the EU.

But, as the Constitution Unit\u2019s <strong>Meg Russell</strong> argues <a href=\"https://constitution-unit.com/2019/11/05/why-a-rhetoric-of-parliament-versus-people-is-both-dishonest-and-dangerous/amp/?__twitter_impression=true\">here,</a> that was because the time allocated to consider the bill was widely seen as unreasonable. Johnson never tried to get MPs to vote for a more reasonable programme motion.</p> \n  <p><strong>3) Johnson claimed that under Labour there would be two referendums in 2020. </strong>He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Or do you want to waste 2020, which could be an absolutely fantastic year for the nation, with two more referendums, one on the European Union on a decision that has yet to be properly outlined for the country under Jeremy Corbyn, and one which risks the break-up of our union of the United Kingdom and risks breaking up the union between Scotland and the rest of the UK?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It is true that Jeremy Corbyn is proposing a second Brexit referendum next year. And it is true that Corbyn has not ruled out agreeing to a second Scottish independence referendum at some point in the future. But Labour has ruled out holding one in 2020.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32c914db1c2f4731cf2d8e7ee86a3150e5ded06d\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32c914db1c2f4731cf2d8e7ee86a3150e5ded06d/38_0_892_535/500.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson addressing cabinet.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson addressing cabinet.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky News/SKY NEWS</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc14a178f08e9e197c396a2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-05T10:09:45.921Z\">10.09am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Jeremy Corbyn speech and the Lib Dem launch were both due to start at 10am.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/05/general-election-news-latest-corbyn-brexit-speech-gove-says-labours-claim-uk-us-trade-deal-cost-cost-nhs-500m-per-week-nonsense-live-news?page=with:block-5dc130e18f084b2b11b8786a#block-5dc130e18f084b2b11b8786a\">9.08am.) </a>Here are some of the other lines from his round of interviews this morning.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Gove, the Cabinet Office minister and the minister in charge of no-deal planning, categorically ruled out an extension to the transition period, which is due to finish at the end of December next year.</strong> Under the proposed withdrawal agreement, the UK would have the option of requesting an extension to this period (during which the UK will officially be out of the EU, but during which it will be still complying with EU law, and paying into the EU budget, while businesses prepare for the new trading rules that will come into force) for one year or two years. But, on the Today programme, asked if the transition period could be extended, Gove replied: \u201cNo.\u201d When the presenter, <strong>Mishal Husain</strong>, asked him if he was saying definitely not, Gove replied: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He also insisted that it would be possible to to negotiate a new trade relationship with the EU before the end of next year. He told the Today programme:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is always the case that we need to prepare for every eventuality, but I am confident that we will be able to get a good relationship with the EU at the end of this period. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In an earlier interview with Sky Gove was more equivocal, just saying that he did not believe there would be an extension to the transition. But his comment in his Today interview confirmed <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7647359/Downing-Street-rules-extending-Brexit-transition-period-past-2020.html\">what No 10 was saying yesterday. </a>Most trade specialists and EU observers believe there is almost no chance of the UK and the EU being able to finalise a new trade deal before the end of next year, although <strong>Michel Barnier,</strong> the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/29/michel-barnier-tells-uk-ignore-eu-regulatory-standards-at-your-peril\"> has recently said</a> that \u201cthe principle elements\u201d of a trade deal could be negotiated before the end of 2020 and that an extension is not inevitable.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Gove claimed that Johnson was someone who had \u201cvanquished the doubters\u201d when it came to his ability to deliver on Brexit.</strong> He used the line an in interview with Sky\u2019s Kay Burley, who was asking him what would happen if the UK and the EU failed to negotiate a trade deal by the end of next year. Burley responded with astonishment, pointing out that Johnson was the person who promised to die in a ditch rather than request a Brexit extension, and then did precisely that. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Gove described the deal that the UK would negotiate with the EU on trade as \u201cCanada plus plus plus\u201d.</strong> Speaking on Sky, he said there would be no tariffs, no quotas and no restrictions on trade with the EU. This is not how trade experts see it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/13/boris-johnson-brexit-deal-theresa-may-trade\">Some of them are using the term \u201cCanada minus\u201d to describe the trade deal proposed by Johnson,</a> because it envisages more friction in UK-EU trade than Theresa May\u2019s plan would have involved.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Gove blamed parliament for the fact that Johnson had to request a Brexit extension, despite the fact that he repeatedly and categorically said that he would not do this.</strong></li> \n

cost the NHS \u00a3500m a week as \u201cridiculous nonsense\u201d.</strong> In his speech later this morning, according to extracts briefed in advance, Corbyn will say:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Luke Harding and Dan Sabbagh have tonight\u2019s main story: Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s main events: The Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, faced calls to resign over comments he made about Grenfell Tower disaster victims. Rees-Mogg suggested those who died after being advised to stay put by firefighters lacked the \u201ccommon sense\u201d to do otherwise. Survivors, relatives of the dead and the grime artist, Stormzy, were among those to fiercely criticise Rees-Mogg, who later apologised. However, his Tory colleague, Andrew Bridgen, later suggested Rees-Mogg would have survived where others did not because he would have been clever enough to ignore the advice. He insisted he believed Rees-Mogg had intended no malice. But Bridgen\u2019s comments were denounced as \u201ccontemptible\u201d by Labour. The prime minister abandoned his pledge to give MPs a vote on whether or not to extend the Brexit transition beyond 31 January 2020. The announcement led to claims Boris Johnson was planning to force through a no-deal Brexit. The Labour leader defended wanting to represent both sides in the Brexit debate. Jeremy Corbyn also claimed he would sort Brexit more quickly than Johnson and that a Tory negotiated US-UK trade deal would unleash \u201cThatcherism on steroids\u201d. Jo Swinson ruled out using Lib Dem votes to put Corbyn in No 10 in the event of a hung parliament. Even today, if you ask him if he is remain or leave, he will not say, she said as the party held its election launch. Swinson also said she would make a better prime minister than both Corbyn and Johnson. A Foreign Office minister dismissed claims No 10 was holding up the publication of the Russia report without justification. Responding to an urgent question in the Commons, Chris Pincher said the report needed to be checked for sensitive information. But the chair of the committee that produced it, Dominic Grieve, said it was cleared by the intelligence services last month. The former chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced he will not seek reelection in December. Hammond, who had the Tory whip suspended in September, told constituents he had considered fighting his seat as an independent, but that that would have led to him being thrown out of the Conservative party. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, spoke to the US president, Donald Trump, this evening, Downing Street says. A spokeswoman added: They discussed security issues, with the prime minister welcoming the US operation which led to the death of al-Baghdadi and underlining the ongoing importance of the fight against Daesh. The prime minister looked forward to the Nato leaders\u2019 meeting next month. They agreed on the need for burden sharing and for Nato to prepare for future threats. The prime minister urged the president to lift tariffs on goods, including Scotch Whisky, and, ahead of a US decision on additional tariffs, urged him not to impose tariffs on car exports. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has urged local councils to find alternative venues for polling stations to avoid disrupting school Christmas plays and concerts. In a letter to returning officers, Williamson wrote: In the run-up to Christmas, schools across the country will be planning festive events such as Christmas plays and carol concerts. These are important highlights in the school calendar and the result of a huge amount of hard work and dedication from staff, parents and children. As you will be aware, central government has agreed to reimburse the necessary costs where needed to support you in identifying alternative venues to avoid disrupting long-planned and important events relating to this time of year. I would be grateful for anything you can do to ensure arrangements for polling stations keep the disruption to school activities over the Christmas period to an absolute minimum and that you work closely with local schools to this end. In every community there will be alternatives and I would ask that, wherever possible, these are used instead. Here\u2019s a little more on the difficulties inherent to December elections \u2013 as well as the history of such votes: The former Tory minister, Justine Greening, will find it difficult to bring herself to vote Conservative at the upcoming election because of the party\u2019s Brexit stance, she has said. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live earlier today, Greening said: I certainly don\u2019t want to see us getting on with what I think would be a very damaging deal for Britain. So, it would be very hard for me to vote for the Conservatives, if I\u2019m looking at what they stand for on Brexit. Explaining her reasoning, she told the station\u2019s presenter, Emma Barnett: Brexit is part of what will drive how I vote, along with millions of other people. It\u2019s not the whole story. I\u2019m still a centre-right conservative-minded voter and and, indeed, politician. But I have had a fundamental difference with my party on Brexit. And so, like many people in this country, I\u2019m going to have to weigh it up. And I think it\u2019s going to be very hard for people in this election because they\u2019re probably going to look at all the parties and think: \u2018I\u2019m not sure I want any of them\u2019 because none of them quite necessarily stack up with where their politics are. Asked whether or not she trusted the prime minister, Boris Johnson, Greening said: Certainly in relation to Heathrow, I\u2019ve been very absolutely disappointed by the fact that, having campaigned with many of us to stop this expansion, he has now seemingly gone back on that word. Pressed on whether or not that meant she trusted him, she added: I find it hard to trust him on other issues when the one that has mattered to me the most as a local campaigner is one that he\u2019s not followed through on. About a million of the commemorative Brexit 50p coins that are now having to be melted down were minted before Boris Johnson chose to pull his Brexit deal and seek a delay, it has emerged. But the government has refused to say how much the operation cost, citing commercial sensitivity. It also emerged that a thousand trial coins were struck to mark the first exit date of 29 March 2019, subsequently missed by Theresa May. Details of the Brexit coins, carrying the words \u201cFriendship with all nations\u201d, came on the last day of Parliament sitting before it broke for the forthcoming general election. Responding to a written parliamentary question by the former EU ambassador, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, the Tory frontbencher, the Earl of Courtown said: Approximately one million coins were minted in October to mark the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union, in addition to 1,000 trial coins that were struck before 29 March. Coins bearing these dates will now be recycled and the value from the materials will be recouped by the Exchequer. The cost of minting these coins is commercially sensitive. The former chancellor, Philip Hammond, had planned a limited edition of about 10,000 commemorative coins to be sold to collectors for \u00a310 each. But his successor, Sajid Javid, pressed for a much greater circulation, portrayed at the time as a statement of intent that the Treasury was fully behind Brexit. A lawyer for the Lib Dems has written to ITV demanding it reverse its decision to not include Jo Swinson in its head-to-head election debate, the party has said: Legal action by the party has been mooted but, as was noted earlier, a Scottish court threw out a similar challenge by Alex Salmond against the BBC in April 2010, which was brought after he was excluded from a leaders\u2019 debate. (see 4.10pm) The prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, warned that the law governing campaigning in a general election is \u201cwide open to abuse\u201d, a member of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee has claimed. This evening, The Labour MP Ian Lucas used a valedictory debate to \u201cdraw to the House\u2019s attention today the serious position that exists on the cusp of a general election\u201d. Lucas, who is standing down at the election, quoted correspondence he said he had secured through the committee between Cummings and the Electoral Commission. He told MPs: I have secured through the committee these documents and I\u2019m placing them in the public record because it is something that should be known by the public in this country before we vote in a general election. We have a general election happening and we have laws in place which are completely inadequate to deal with that general election. And I just want to quote to this House the words of Dominic Cummings in correspondence that he sent to the Electoral Commission. It says: \u2018Overall, it is clear that the entire regulatory structure around national elections, including data, is really bad. There are so many contradictions, gaps, logical lacuna, that it\u2019s wide open to abuse. There has been no proper audit by anybody of how the rules could be exploited by an internal or foreign force to swing close elections\u2019. \u2018These problems were not fixed for the 2017 election and I doubt they will be imminently. The system cannot cope with the fast-changing technology\u2019. So, the main adviser to the prime minister is telling us that the current legal structure for elections is unsound. We are going into a general election which is going to be fought online and we\u2019re already seeing the way in which that is affecting the campaign we are facing. Boris Johnson has spoken to the Egyptian president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi this evening, Downing Street says. A spokeswoman added: The leaders welcomed the recent lifting of restrictions on flights from the UK to Sharm el-Sheikh as the first step towards services resuming and emphasised the importance of close cooperation between the UK and Egypt on security. The two leaders agreed to continue to work together to strengthen the relationship between the UK and Egypt, particularly in areas of trade and education. The prime minister welcomed the opening of three new British university campuses in Egypt. Conservative plans to use the civil service to rubbish Labour\u2019s spending plans have been scuppered after the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, argued with senior civil servants that it would breach impartiality rules. Forcing a climbdown before the general election, Britain\u2019s highest ranking civil servant, Mark Sedwill, made a decision that the publication of Treasury analysis with only weeks to go before the 12 December poll would be improper. The government had planned to open its election campaign with an attack this week on Labour\u2019s economic credibility. However, opposition sources said the government had been slapped down by senior civil servants, forcing an embarrassing U-turn. In an email exchange seen by the Guardian, the cabinet office told the party: \u201cTo confirm our conversation, these costings will not be published.\u201d A Labour source said: \u201cThis is an embarrassing slapdown to Tory ministers who were blatantly trying to use the civil service for political purposes.\u201d Labour have heavily criticised the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, as well as his Tory colleague Andrew Bridgen, over their comments on the Grenfell Tower disaster. Earlier today, Rees-Mogg said it would have been \u201ccommon sense\u201d for people living in Grenfell Tower to have ignored the fire brigade and to have left the building once the fire started. He later apologised (see 2.08pm). This evening, Bridgen has told BBC Radio 4\u2019s PM programme: Jacob is a good friend of mine and he\u2019s an extremely intelligent and compassionate human being and his comments regarding Grenfell were uncharacteristically clumsy. But I think we have to put them in the context of Jacob, I mean, Jacob is a leader; he is an authority figure. And what he has failed to realise is that, in a life-threatening and stressful situation, most people \u2013 most of the public \u2013 will probably defer to the advice of an authority figure \u2013 be that someone from the fire authority or the police \u2013 and not come to their own conclusions. And, as we know with regard to Grenfell, that advice was flawed. Bridgen said he believed Rees-Mogg meant he would not have stayed put were he caught up in the disaster \u2013 even if told to do so by firefighters. The interviewer, Evan Davis, put it to him that that was, in fact, central to people\u2019s objections, adding that Rees-Mogg was, in effect, saying he would not have died because he would have been cleverer than those who took the fire brigade\u2019s advice. After a lengthy pause and a sigh, Bridgen replied: But we want very clever people running the country, don\u2019t we Evan? That\u2019s a by-product of what Jacob is an that\u2019s why he\u2019s in a position of authority. What he\u2019s actually saying is that he would have made a better decision than the authority figures who gave that advice. But I can assure you there\u2019s absolutely no malice and no... I mean, he\u2019s one of the most compassionate and thoughtful politicians we\u2019ve got. Bridgen agreed that Rees-Mogg \u201clives in a different world\u201d to those who lived in Grenfell Tower and, therefore, finds it difficult to empathise; adding that he is not alone among politicians and people who work in the media in that respect. Andrew Gwynne, Labour\u2019s national campaign co-ordinator, called Bridgen\u2019s comments \u201ccontemptible\u201d and said the Tory leader should remove him as a candidate. What Rees-Mogg and Bridgen said go to the poisonous heart of the Tories\u2019 attitude towards people in our communities. The choice at this election is clear \u2013 the Tories who blame the victims of tragedy, or Labour who are on your side. The Labour MP, David Lammy, also criticised Bridgen and called on Rees-Mogg to resign from the government: As the main parties ramp up their election campaigns, letterboxes across the country will begin to clog with leaflets vying to attract voters\u2019 attention. We want to hear the most outlandish claims your local candidates from the main political parties or independents have made to try to win your vote. If you\u2019ve spotted claims you think should be challenged, unverified bar charts, or facts you think need checking, send them over to us. You can do so here: The Tory MP and Brexiter Andrew Bridgen defended what Jacob Rees-Mogg had to say about the victims of the Grenfell Tower not having enough sense (see 2.08pm), in an interview on the BBC Radio 4 PM programme a few minutes ago. These are from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. From my colleague Rowena Mason The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, says he will be broadcasting on Facebook every day, staring this evening at 6pm. With parliament dissolving tonight ahead of the election, ministers have released a flurry of minor-ish announcements that they have been holding back because, on a quieter day, they would attract too much bad publicity. The Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom has a good summary of them here. From Stefan Rousseau, the Press Association\u2019s chief political photographer During Foreign Office questions in the Commons earlier Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, denied that Downing Street was in the grip of a \u201cKremlin mole\u201d. He was responding to a question from his Labour shadow, Emily Thornberry, who asked about Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s de facto chief of staff, who worked in Russia after leaving university. Thornberry asked: Does Mr Cummings have unredacted access to top secret intelligence and unrestricted access to top secret meetings relating to Nato, Russia, Ukraine and Syria, yes or no? Raab replied: As she knows, the government and ministers do not comment on security clearance. But I think that the insinuation in her letter that No 10 is somehow in the grip of a Kremlin mole is frankly ridiculous even by the standards of the \u2018loony left\u2019. Jeremy Corbyn sounded confident talking about his Brexit policy this morning. (See 1.16pm.) But, according to this YouGov polling, by three to one voters are more likely to say Labour\u2019s Brexit policy is not clear than that it is clear. All the other main GB parties (the Tories, the Lib Dems and the Brexit party) have Brexit policies that are widely seen as clear. There have been two GB polls out in the last 24 hours or so. An ICM poll gives the Conservatives a seven-point lead. A YouGov poll gives the Conservatives a 13-point lead. The Times\u2019s Matt Chorley has posted on Twitter an interesting chart showing how trends in the YouGov pre-election polling compare with the trends at the same point before the 2017 general election. And Joe Murphy in the Evening Standard says YouGov polling in London shows that Labour\u2019s lead over the Tories in the capital is half what it was at the 2017 general election. In his story, Murphy quotes Prof Philip Cowley, an elections expert, saying this about the new figures. Compared to the position in 2017, these figures mean a fall of 16 points in the Labour share of the vote and just a four point drop in the Conservative share. In practice, assuming no change by polling day, this would almost certainly mean seats being lost by Labour and gained by the Conservatives. Nicola Sturgeon has said the SNP will consider legal action against broadcasters that exclude her party from leaders\u2019 election debates, after it complained to Ofcom over Sky News refusal to include the SNP. Kirsten Oswald, the SNP\u2019s business convenor at Westminster, wrote to Sky and Ofcom on Wednesday to complain that its plans to invite only Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn and Jo Swinson were \u201cundemocratic and completely inexcusable\u201d. The SNP said it \u201ccould test the matter in the courts if it is not swiftly resolved\u201d. It believes excluding other Westminster parties breaches the Ofcom code on screening a wide range of significant views, taking account of past or current electoral support. The SNP is currently Westminster\u2019s third-largest party and claims the polls show it will remain so after the election. The first minister, campaigning in the Labour-held marginal of Midlothian, said: We will consider all of our options. [It] remains to be seen whether this Sky debate goes ahead because to the best of my knowledge Johnson and Corbyn haven\u2019t agreed to it yet. But there\u2019s an issue of real principle here of how how can you include the fourth biggest party in the UK in a debate like this and not the third biggest party. We\u2019ll take forward these discussions, but I\u2019m ruling nothing out at this stage. The Lib Dems have mooted legal action against ITV for screening a Johnson against Corbyn debate that excludes Swinson, but in April 2010 a Scottish court threw out a similar challenge brought by Alex Salmond against the BBC after he was excluded from a leaders\u2019 debate. Critics argue that since Sturgeon is not standing for Westminster and cannot become prime minister, and as the SNP is only contesting seats in Scotland, it does not have the same standing as UK-wide parties in a Westminster contest. The grime artist Stormzy has joined those criticising Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, for saying the Grenfell Tower victims should have had the sense to ignore fire brigade advice to stay put. (See 2.08pm.) There are a series of tweets about Rees-Mogg on his Twitter feed. Here\u2019s one. The BBC\u2019s Daniel Sandford says the Tories have doctored a video featuring Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, to show him in an unfavourable light. I\u2019ve asked the Tories for a comment, and will post the reply when I get it. Conservative candidates in the general election will be told not to sign up to specific pledges on protecting the NHS from privatisation and trade deals or tackling climate change, according to a leaked internal document from party headquarters, my colleague Nick Hopkins reports. Philip Hammond, the former chancellor, has announced that he is standing down. He was one of the 21 Tories who had the whip removed in September over Brexit, and was not one of the 10 from that group who had the whip restored. In an open letter to his constituents, he suggests that he considered fighting his seat, Runnymede and Weybridge, as an independent, but that this would have led to him being thrown out of the Conservative party (which is different from having the whip removed). That is not what he wanted, he suggests. Hammond says that he is \u201csaddened\u201d to find himself in this situation after 45 years as a party member. But he remains a Conservative, he says, and does not want to challenge the party at an election. He also says he intends to remain an active party member, and that he will be working \u201cto ensure that the Conservative party of the future is a broad-based, forward-looking, pro-business and pro-markets centre-right party\u201d. Anne Milton, the Guildford MP who was one of the 21 Tories who had the whip removed after rebelling over Brexit, has said that she will stand as an independent. She was not one of the 10 rebels who subsequently had the whip restored. At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning the prime minister\u2019s spokesman ruled out MPs being given a vote on whether or not to request an extension to the Brexit transition, which is due to finish at the end of next year. The government is now ruling out an extension (see 9.45am), even though many people assume an extension will be necessary, and so it is perhaps not surprising that No 10 is ruling out a vote. Asked if MPs would be allowed a vote on an extension, the spokesman told journalists: The answer to that is a simple no. We aren\u2019t extending the implementation period. There is no reason whatsoever why we will not secure a deal by that date. Both the UK and the EU are committed to reaching a trade agreement by that date and that is what we are going to do. David Gauke, the former justice secretary who was one of the 21 Tories who had the whip removed over Brexit, says, without an extension, the UK will face a no-deal Brexit in December 2020. He also says the new No 10 line directly contradicts what Robert Buckland, Gauke\u2019s successor as justice secretary, told MPs only two weeks ago about how MPs would get a vote on an extension. Nick Boles, another former Tory who left the party by his own choice over Brexit, also claims this decision means Johnson is planning a no-deal Brexit at the end of next year. He tabled an amendment to the withdrawal agreement bill that would have guaranteed MPs a vote on extending the transition. If Johnson does win a majority, one key question will be whether or not there are enough Tory MPs willing to rebel with the opposition to force through a Boles-style amendment saying parliament should have a vote on an extension. Although Boles says that No 10 ruling out an extension to the transition means Johnson is planning a no-deal Brexit, a more credible explanation is that he is just making a promise now that he has no intention of keeping - as when he went back on his promise not to agree to customs controls down the Irish Sea (see 10.32am), or broke his \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge not to request a Brexit extension. Yesterday John Woodcock, the Labour-turned-independent MP, announced that he was standing down from parliament. Today Priti Patel, the home secretary, has appointed him as UK special envoy for countering violent extremism. Woodcock, like his fellow former Labour MP John Mann, who was appointed independent adviser on antisemitism by Theresa May, has been highly critical of Jeremy Corbyn, particularly over antisemitism. The most memorable story of the day will probably turn out to be Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, apologising for saying it would have been \u201ccommon sense\u201d for people living in Grenfell Tower to have ignored the fire brigade and to have left the building once the fire started. My colleague Kate Proctor has written it up here. Here is some comment from politicians. From Jeremy Corbyn From Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary From Humza Yousaf, the Scottish justice secretary From Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary And here is some comment from journalists. From the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson From the broadcaster Tom Sutcliffe Jo Swinson has formally launched the Liberal Democrats\u2019 election campaign with a remain-dominated message, insisting she can become prime minister but declining to specify what the party might do if it holds the balance of power, my colleague Peter Walker reports. Here\u2019s a question from below the line. Gavin Freeguard from the Institute for Government has a tally. The UK and European Union face \u201ca moment of truth\u201d in post-Brexit trade talks next summer, Michel Barnier has said. In a sign that he does not share Boris Johnson\u2019s confidence that no extension of the Brexit transition period is needed (see 9.45am), Barnier warned that the risk of a no-deal \u201ccliff edge\u201d remained. If the UK leaves the EU with a deal on 31 January, only 11 months remain of the post-Brexit transition, a period when the UK will remain in the EU single market and customs union, without having any say over decisions. The government has the choice to seek a one-off extension of the transition until the end of 2021 or 2022, but must agree any extension with the EU by 1 July 2020. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said on Monday that the UK would not extend the transition period. Barnier, who has seen the UK extend withdrawal negotiations three times, sounded unconvinced: \u201cSummer 2020 will be a moment of truth in how far we have come and whether an extension will be needed,\u201d he told a tech conference in Lisbon on Tuesday. Recently rehired by Brussels to lead talks on the future relationship with the UK, Barnier also issued a reminder that the current withdrawal agreement was \u201ca necessary step\u201d but not the \u201cfinal destination\u201d. Approval of the Brexit withdrawal deal by the UK parliament is the prelude to years more negotiations on a free trade agreement and foreign policy links. \u201cAs long as we have not completed both negotiations [the withdrawal agreement and future talks] with the UK, the risk of a cliff edge remains and we should all remain vigilant,\u201d Barnier said. Reiterating what he told the Guardian and other European newspapers last week, he said the EU would not compromise its environmental, social and economic standards in exchange for a free trade deal. He stressed that an agreement on zero quotas and zero tariffs on trade would be linked to respecting EU norms on the environment, worker protections and state aid, in order to maintain a level playing field between EU and British companies. \u201cThe EU will not tolerate unfair competitive advantage.\u201d He predicted the negotiations would be \u201cdifficult and demanding\u201d because the time is \u201cextremely short\u201d and because the UK \u201cmight want to diverge from EU rules\u201d. Some Tories have been assuming that Brexit will work best for them, not Labour, as an election issue. There are many voters, including people who voted remain, who are desperate for this to disappear as a problem facing the country, and in No 10 there was an assumption that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s stance - promising to a second referendum, but refusing now to say how he would campaign in it - would prove a liability. But it did not particularly look like that this morning. Rather than duck Brexit as an issue, Corbyn this morning sought to switch it into a campaign positive for him, particular with his claim about how he could actually put it to bed as an issue more quickly than Boris Johnson. Here are the main points. Corbyn claimed that Labour would resolve the Brexit crisis facing the UK more quickly than Boris Johnson - because Johnson would spend years negotiating trade deals, while Labour wouldn\u2019t. (See 11.34am.) This involved an implicit admission that, under a Labour soft Brexit, the UK would not be negotiating its own trade deals because it would be working on them in conjunction with the EU. This is something that Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, conceded in an interview on the Today programme this morning. Corbyn defended his policy of trying to represent people on both sides of the Brexit debate. (See 11.36am.) He said that a UK-US trade deal of the kind envisaged by the Tories would unleash unleash \u201cThatcherism on steroids\u201d on Britain. (See 11.28am.) He defended the claim that a UK-US trade deal could cost the NHS an extra \u00a3500m a week in higher drug prices (see 9.08am), saying that this was an accurate and credible figure. Labour say this figure comes from what Liverpool University\u2019s Dr Andrew Hill, an adviser to the WHO, told the Channel 4 Dispatches documentary last week. Hill said: Our annual drugs bill for the NHS is \u00a318bn, if we had to have American drug prices we are talking about \u00a318bn a year going up to \u00a345bn, so that\u2019s an extra \u00a327bn a year, or \u00a3500m a week extra for the NHS to pay. Corbyn dismissed suggestions that Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party should appeal to Labour voters, saying Farage was a \u201cone-trick pony\u201d. Corbyn went on: He doesn\u2019t actually offer anything to any of those communities. Our message and manifesto is about investing in all parts of this country. Corbyn sidestepped a question about whether Labour would keep freedom of movement under its proposed plan for a soft Brexit. In the past Labour has said that freedom of movement would end if the UK left the EU, but at the party conference delegates passed a motion backing the principle of freedom of movement. In a separate interview today Starmer said freedom of movement would have to be part of any Labour negotiation with the EU over the terms of its soft Brexit. He did not rule out letting ministers campaign on either side during a second Brexit referendum. When asked if this would be an option, he just said the party would decide its stance at a special conference ahead of the proposed referendum. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, tells MPs the government\u2019s refusal to publish this report is unjustified and politically motivated. It is \u201cnothing less than an attempt to suppress the truth\u201d, she says. Pincher repeats the point about the turnaround time for the publication of this report being not unusual. Grieve is responding to Pincher now. He says the committee finished its report in March. He says it was then vetted for sensitive information, and it was cleared by the intelligence services by October. Then it was sent to No 10 for approval before publication. He says the claim the intelligence agencies have already said publicly that the publication of this report will not hinder their work. So why is No 10 not publishing it? He says Downing Street cannot remove material from these reports. He says there have been claims from No 10 that weeks of further consultation is necessary. That is not true. And he also asks the government to withdraw the \u201cslur\u201d, which he says came from No 10, that parts of the report have already been leaked. Pincher says it is not unusual for the review of ISC reports to take some time. The prime minister has had other things to do in recent weeks, Pincher says. He says the PM has a specific responsibility to check that there is nothing sensitive in these reports before they are published. In the Commons Dominic Grieve, the chair of the intelligence and security committee, has just asked an urgent question about why No 10 has refused to publish his committee\u2019s report into Russian meddling in UK politics. Chris Pincher, the Foreign Office minister, is responding. He says these reports always contain sensitive information. He says it is normal for the government to spend around six weeks looking at these reports before publishing them to ensure that sensitive information does not get into the public domain. He says Grieve\u2019s committee knows this. Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet discussed abuse of election candidates at a meeting this morning, agreeing that the government will write to social media companies calling on them to protect politicians from online threats. They will be asked to set up \u201cone-stop shops\u201d where candidates can report abusive online behaviour. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: Cabinet discussed the safeguards which will be in place during the campaign to protect all candidates from intimidation and abuse. Cabinet agreed that people who intimidate public figures should face the consequences of their actions. The freedom to hold respectful, vibrant and robust debate cannot be an excuse to cause harm, spread hatred or impose views upon others ... Ministers are also writing to social media companies calling or action to prevent candidates being subjected to abuse online, and to encourage the companies to work together during the campaign. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish National party leader, has said she will \u201cdrive a hard bargain\u201d in any post-election talks with Jeremy Corbyn about supporting a minority Labour government. Sturgeon refused to rule out negotiating a formal \u201cconfidence and supply\u201d arrangement with Labour but she told Kay Burley on Sky News her strong preference would be to support Labour on a vote by vote basis. Sturgeon said: Let\u2019s see what the arithmetic is. There will be no formal coalition... [I] would favour more, and be more likely to be, in a situation where we have an issue by issue arrangement, where we support on some things but don\u2019t support on others. But we will drive a hard bargain and we will stand up for Scotland\u2019s interests and we will stand up for the kind of progressive values that people across the UK think are important. We will want to see a very strong position on Brexit. This is an opportunity for Scotland and for what it\u2019s worth the rest of the UK to escape the mess of Brexit. That conforms with Corbyn\u2019s repeated insistence Labour will not form coalitions with any other party, but Sturgeon\u2019s reference to the SNP driving a \u201chard bargain\u201d were picked up by the Scottish Tories. Tory allegations that Corbyn and Sturgeon have already struck a deal where Labour will grant the SNP powers to stage a second independence vote next year mushroomed after Sturgeon confirmed last week the pair had had private talks late last month. Sturgeon said last month Corbyn shouldn\u2019t \u201cbother picking up the phone\u201d if he was not prepared to authorise a second Scotland referendum, and has confirmed she plans to ask for the section 30 powers to hold it within days of the election next month. Labour sources say that conversation was entirely about post-election strategies to thwart a no-deal Brexit and deny there was any discussion of pacts or independence. Labour officials say the party\u2019s first priority would be renegotiating a new Brexit deal and putting that to a confirmatory referendum. Corbyn and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, have confirmed they are open to granting a second independence vote, but only after several years of Labour rule at Westminster, and assuming pro-independence parties win a majority and a fresh mandate in the 2021 Holyrood elections. Q: Nigel Farage says he will target Labour MPs in leave-voting seats. He says you are out of touch with these people. How will you assure people you are in touch? Corbyn says Farage is a one-trick pony from a very rich organisation. He says Farage is not offering anything that would solve the problems facing these communities. Labour would set up a national investment bank to invest in these regions. His message is that a Labour government will improve these communities, he says. Q: Would you accept revoking article 50 as the price of a coalition in a hung parliament with the Lib Dems? Corbyn says he is campaigning to win the election with a majority Labour government. He is not campaigning to form a coalition with anyone. Q: If you held a referendum, and remain won very narrowly on a smaller turnout than in 2016, would you consider that the final word on the matter for the next 40 years. Corbyn says he wants the whole debate to be over. He wants to lead a Labour government that would carry out Labour policies, and that would be a voice for justice on the world stage. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I will post a summary shortly. Q: You quoted a figure for a trade deal costing the NHS \u00a3500m a week that is based on a crude assumption about all drug prices being the same as in the US. Isn\u2019t this misleading? Corbyn says he believes this to be an accurate and credible figure. He would not be using it otherwise. And he says he is happy for people to analyse it, and to tell him if he is understating the case. Corbyn says Johnson wants a trade deal with the US. They want a trade deal, knowing full well the US will demand alignment and full market access. And you will see the price of it, he says. He says a vote for Boris Johnson involves a vote for a trade deal, and all that goes with it. Q: You have made it clear you will not say how you would campaign in a second Brexit referendum. But would you be happy for your ministers to campaign on either side during that campaign. Corbyn says the Labour policy has been arrived at through debate. That is one thing the party is good at debate; they love it. They have experts in all areas. He says he has tried to bring the party together. It agreed a Brexit policy at its conference in Brighton. He says Labour activists are campaigning on this policy. After a three-month negotiation, Labour would hold a special conference. At that point it would come to a view, he says. He says he would want a referendum to have informed debate, and very strict spending limits. Labour would then carry out the referendum decision. And there would be no further debate, he says. Corbyn is now taking questions. Q: You had some fun talking about Boris Johnson\u2019s deadline. But you say you can get Brexit done by 13 June. Is that a fixed deadline for you? Or could you go beyond that, if the talks take longer or the referendum legislation takes longer? Corbyn says this deadline is a realistic one. He says he and Keir Starmer have spent many hours in Brussels discussing their plans. They would not be discussing this if it was not realistic. The referendum legislation could start going through before the negotiations had finished. Starmer has a season ticket for the Eurostar, he says. Q: Will freedom of movement remain under Labour? Corbyn says EU nationals would have an absolute right to remain after Brexit. Their rights would be guaranteed. He does not address the specific point about the freedom of movement that currently applies because the UK is in the EU. Q: President Trump has denied wanting to include the NHS in a trade deal. And the government says it will not include this. So this is just a scare story, isn\u2019t it? Corbyn says Trump himself said the NHS had to be included. And the US ambassador said the NHS would be included. And, if the government assurances are true, why did the government allow officials to have six meetings with US officials on this subject. He says the threat is real. The Americans talk about the UK health market. Corbyn says it is the national health service. And the key word is service. Q: Will your renegotiation reopen the withdrawal agreement? Or will it just consider the political declaration. Corbyn says Labour would rip up the withdrawal agreement on day one and start again. Corbyn defends his own stance on Brexit. People sometimes accuse me of trying to talk to both sides at once in the Brexit debate; to people who voted leave and remain. You know what? They\u2019re right. Why would I only want to talk to half the country? I don\u2019t want to live in half a country. Anybody seeking to become prime minister must talk to and listen to the whole country. Labour stands not just for the 52% or the 48%, but for the 99%. It\u2019s Labour that\u2019s determined to bring a divided country together. Corbyn summarises Labour\u2019s Brexit policy - a renegotiation, and a referendum, with remain and a soft Brexit proposal as the options. And he claims that this would enable Labour to \u201csort\u201d Brexit more quickly than would happen under the Conservatives. The irony is, for all his boasting, Johnson\u2019s sell-out deal still won\u2019t get Brexit done. It will lead to years of continuing negotiations and uncertainty. Whereas Labour\u2019s plan will sort Brexit quickly, because whatever the final decision, we won\u2019t be ripping up our main trading relationship. The EU negotiator Michel Barnier has said an EU trade deal on Johnson\u2019s terms would take \u201cthree years, maybe more\u201d of further negotiations. Johnson\u2019s sell-out deal with Trump could take even longer. A vote for the Conservatives is a vote for yet more drawn-out, bogged down negotiations, more broken promises, and more distraction from the vital issues facing all of us - like making sure people have decent wages, secure homes, and a habitable planet for our children and grandchildren. A green light for Boris Johnson\u2019s sell-out Trump deal would just be the start of years more Brexit chaos and division. Corbyn says a Tory UK-US trade deal would unleash \u201cThatcherism on steroids\u201d on the UK. He says: For many in the Tory party this is what Brexit has always been about: reversing the hard-fought gains won by working class people over generations. Given the chance, they\u2019ll run down our rights at work, our entitlements to holidays, breaks and leave. Given the chance, they\u2019ll slash food standards to match the US, where what are called \u201cacceptable levels\u201d of rat hairs in paprika, and maggots in orange juice are allowed and they\u2019ll put chlorinated chicken on our supermarket shelves. And given the chance they\u2019ll water down the rules on air pollution and our environment that keep us safe. They want a race to the bottom in standards and protections. They want to move us towards a more deregulated American model of how to run the economy. In the US workers get just 10 days holiday a year, big business gets free rein to call the shots and tens of millions are denied healthcare. What Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives want is to hijack Brexit to unleash Thatcherism on steroids. The Thatcher government\u2019s attack on the working people of our country left scars that have never healed and communities that have never recovered. Corbyn is now covering what might happen if the Tories negotiate a UK-US trade deal. Some extracts on this subject were released overnight. (See 9.08am.) Here is the rest of the passage. Just look at how these corporations operate in the US. They are ruthless. They will suck as much money as they can out of our NHS while cancer patients wait longer for treatment. We now know that US and UK officials have been discussing drug pricing in secret, and the US government is demanding what its officials call \u201cfull market access for US products\u201d. Senior NHS managers have said that would mean \u201chigher prices for medicines\u201d which will \u201cpass on costs to both patients and the NHS\u201d. So there we have it. Johnson can deny it all he likes, but people won\u2019t believe him. And the Tories know that \u2013 which is why, behind the scenes, the Conservatives have tried to suppress the news attacking the BBC for reporting what we and health professionals are saying. This is what they don\u2019t want you to hear: a vote for Johnson\u2019s Conservatives is a vote to betray our NHS in a sell out to Trump. Johnson\u2019s Trump deal Brexit puts a price tag on our NHS. So we\u2019ll say it again and again until the message gets through to the White House: our NHS is not for sale. Activists at the event start shouting: \u201cNot for sale\u201d. Corbyn tells them to make sure this message is heard on the doorsteps. Corbyn also praises the two Labour shadow cabinet ministers who spoke before he took the stage, Laura Pidcock and Sir Keir Starmer. He particularly praises the way Starmer and his team were able to provide the party with a comprehensive analysis of Boris Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement overnight, so that Corbyn and his colleagues had it the morning after the agreement was published. Jeremy Corbyn starts by praising the Labour candidate in Harlow, Laura McAlpine. Two years ago the Tory Robert Halfon had a majority here of 7,031. Swinson is still speaking at the Lib Dem event, but I\u2019m going to switch now to Jeremy Corbyn, who has just started his Brexit speech. Q: Are there any Tory or Labour MPs you would not accept into the Lib Dems? Yes, says Swinson. But she won\u2019t name names. Q: Would you rule out putting any Labour into No 10 willing to allow a second Scottish independence referendum? Swinson says the Lib Dems are opposed to second independence referendum. She says Labour are in the clutches of Corbyn and his supporters. Even if the leader were to change, the direction of policy would not. Q: What is your message to leave voters? How would you bring the country together if a Lib Dem government revoked article 50? Swinson says she understands the challenge this would be. As a Scot, she knows what it is like being in a divided country. Many people have been unhappy with the way things have been going. A Lib Dem government would address those problems. That is how to bring the country together. Q: As prime minister would you refuse to deal with Donald Trump? Swinson says she would not refuse to deal with him. There are plenty of world leaders the Lib Dems have their differences with, but who they would engage with. But she says the decision to offer Trump a state visit was the wrong thing to do because of Trump\u2019s values. Q: Why will you stand down candidates against some remain parties, but not against Labour candidates who are personally committed to remain? Swinson says the Labour party is not at all serious about stopping Brexit. She says Rosie Duffield, the Labour candidate in Canterbury, is great. She would be welcome to join the Liberal Democrats. Q: Would you prop up another form of government in a hung parliament? Swinson says she is offering to the public a Lib Dem government. She says she is speaking in the constituency of the Cities of London and Westminster. The Lib Dems have never been in contention here. But this time, with Chuka Umunna as a candidate, they are in the running. Q: You have said Jeremy Corbyn is unfit to be PM. But, in the event of a hung parliament, would back him to be in Downing Street so he could deliver a second referendum. Swinson says she is \u201cabsolutely, categorically\u201d ruling out using Lib Dem votes to put Corbyn into No 10. Even today, if you ask him if he is remain or leave, he will not say, she says. She says she does not trust him on the economy, or on defence. And one of the most important values is equality. Corbyn\u2019s failure to root out antisemitism in his party is a \u201ctotal dereliction of duty\u201d, she says. (It is worth pointing out that ruling out using Lib Dem votes to put Corbyn into No 10 is not the same as saying the party would vote against Corbyn in a confidence vote. This form of words would be compatible with the Lib Dems abstaining in such a vote, although Swinson did imply she would oppose him.) Q: When before has a position ever won a general election from the point the Lib Dems are starting now? Isn\u2019t it the case that you wanted an election because it would help you win seats, even though the result might deliver Brexit? Swinson says politics is different now. She thinks opinion has shifted. That is why she is setting out ambitious plans for a Lib Dem government. Swinson is now taking questions. Q: You say you want to bring the country together. But how will you do that if you overturn the referendum result? Swinson says the Lib Dems are standing up for what they believe in. Swinson says one in five people in the UK are living in poverty, and 4.6 million of them are children. She says she wants to live in a country where people can achieve whatever they want to, where people get the help they need, and where can be whoever they want to be. Swinson accuses Johnson of modelling himself on Donald Trump. With his big lies, his brash promises and his attitude to women, it\u2019s clear that Boris Johnson is modelling himself on Donald Trump. But Britain deserves better than the British Donald Trump. And she says only this morning Corbyn was giving a speech saying he will get Brexit done. That just shows how similar to the two main parties are, she says. Swinson says the Lib Dems recognise that society is stronger because of immigration. In other times in these circumstances the Lib Dems might have hoped to double their seats. But the country needs the Lib Dems to be more ambitious, she says. She says what Labour and the Tories are offering on Brexit is not good enough. It is not about the red team and the blue team, because on this issue they merge into one. Swinson says she never expected to be a candidate for PM. But she has looked at Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn and decided she is certain she could do a better job as PM. Swinson says all four nations of the UK are stronger when they stand together. She will never stop fighting for the UK \u201cbecause we are stronger together when we are united, and it\u2019s precious, and we must not let people wreck it\u201d. Jo Swinson is speaking now. She says the Lib Dems will \u201cstop Brexit and build a brighter future\u201d. Some people ask why the Lib Dems are being so ambitious now. It is because they can be, and they have to be. Politics is no longer about left versus right. It is about values, she says. The only uncertainty is what will emerge, she says. Will things go back to usual? Or is this a moment for seismic change? Can a new politics emerge? She says voters have that choice. Change is possible, and you get to choose. She cites MPs like Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna, who defected to the Lib Dems, as examples of people who chose change. Berger says Lib Dems have often heard people ask who would be worse - Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn. They are two leaders stuck in the past, failing time and time again, she says. But there is a better choice, she says. She says she is excited at being able to campaign for the Lib Dem programme. She says every one in the community would be valued and cared for, and business would be treated as part of the solution, not part of the problem. Berger says Jo Swinson is someone who represents a new way of doing politics. She stands up for remainers, and she is the Lib Dem candidate for prime minister. Luciana Berger, the former Labour MP who defected to the Lib Dems, is introducing Jo Swinson at the Lib Dem election launch. She says the Lib Dems have an opportunity to stop Brexit. Boris Johnson has been chairing cabinet this morning, and Downing Street let the cameras in to film the PM delivering an upbeat, pre-election message to his team. He did not say anything that he had not said before, but his words were significant because they probably encapsulate his key election pitch. They also contain three statements that are significantly misleading at the very least. 1) Johnson said he negotiated a Brexit deal when people said it could not be done. He told the cabinet. We have achieved something that people thought we really couldn\u2019t do, and that was get a new deal, and a great new deal on our Brexit from the European Union. They said it couldn\u2019t be done. People were sceptical about Johnson\u2019s ability to negotiate a new Brexit deal with the EU. But that was because they were rash enough to believe the commitment Johnson himself gave he spoke at the DUP\u2019s annual conference in November 2018 and said no Conservative government could sign up to a plan that would impose customs controls between Britain and Northern Ireland. 2) Johnson claimed parliament blocked his deal. He told the cabinet: Unfortunately parliament at the last minute decided to block it. Parliament voted to give his bill a second reading. It did vote against his programme motion. But, as the Constitution Unit\u2019s Meg Russell argues here, that was because the time allocated to consider the bill was widely seen as unreasonable. Johnson never tried to get MPs to vote for a more reasonable programme motion. 3) Johnson claimed that under Labour there would be two referendums in 2020. He said: Or do you want to waste 2020, which could be an absolutely fantastic year for the nation, with two more referendums, one on the European Union on a decision that has yet to be properly outlined for the country under Jeremy Corbyn, and one which risks the break-up of our union of the United Kingdom and risks breaking up the union between Scotland and the rest of the UK? It is true that Jeremy Corbyn is proposing a second Brexit referendum next year. And it is true that Corbyn has not ruled out agreeing to a second Scottish independence referendum at some point in the future. But Labour has ruled out holding one in 2020. The Jeremy Corbyn speech and the Lib Dem launch were both due to start at 10am. But I\u2019m now told the Lib Dem event is due to start at 10.30am, and the Labour event about 20 minutes later. In a subsequent interview with ITV, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said there was \u201cno way\u201d the Tories would allow drug prices to rise as a result of a trade deal with the US. In his own interview with the Today programme Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said that he was confident Labour would be able to negotiate a new withdrawal agreement with the EU within three months, as it is proposing. He explained: I have been talking to officials in the [European] commission for the best part of three years and to very senior politicians in all the EU 27 countries. I know very well what the parameters of a deal are. I am confident, first, that it can be secured and second that it can be secured within a very short period of time. I am confident that this can be done in three months. I actually think it will take a lot less. I have already quoted Michael Gove dismissing the Labour claim about a Tory UK-US trade deal potentially costing the NHS \u00a3500m a year as being nonsense. (See 9.08am.) Here are some of the other lines from his round of interviews this morning. Gove, the Cabinet Office minister and the minister in charge of no-deal planning, categorically ruled out an extension to the transition period, which is due to finish at the end of December next year. Under the proposed withdrawal agreement, the UK would have the option of requesting an extension to this period (during which the UK will officially be out of the EU, but during which it will be still complying with EU law, and paying into the EU budget, while businesses prepare for the new trading rules that will come into force) for one year or two years. But, on the Today programme, asked if the transition period could be extended, Gove replied: \u201cNo.\u201d When the presenter, Mishal Husain, asked him if he was saying definitely not, Gove replied: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He also insisted that it would be possible to to negotiate a new trade relationship with the EU before the end of next year. He told the Today programme: It is always the case that we need to prepare for every eventuality, but I am confident that we will be able to get a good relationship with the EU at the end of this period. In an earlier interview with Sky Gove was more equivocal, just saying that he did not believe there would be an extension to the transition. But his comment in his Today interview confirmed what No 10 was saying yesterday. Most trade specialists and EU observers believe there is almost no chance of the UK and the EU being able to finalise a new trade deal before the end of next year, although Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has recently said that \u201cthe principle elements\u201d of a trade deal could be negotiated before the end of 2020 and that an extension is not inevitable. Gove claimed that Johnson was someone who had \u201cvanquished the doubters\u201d when it came to his ability to deliver on Brexit. He used the line an in interview with Sky\u2019s Kay Burley, who was asking him what would happen if the UK and the EU failed to negotiate a trade deal by the end of next year. Burley responded with astonishment, pointing out that Johnson was the person who promised to die in a ditch rather than request a Brexit extension, and then did precisely that. Gove described the deal that the UK would negotiate with the EU on trade as \u201cCanada plus plus plus\u201d. Speaking on Sky, he said there would be no tariffs, no quotas and no restrictions on trade with the EU. This is not how trade experts see it. Some of them are using the term \u201cCanada minus\u201d to describe the trade deal proposed by Johnson, because it envisages more friction in UK-EU trade than Theresa May\u2019s plan would have involved. Gove blamed parliament for the fact that Johnson had to request a Brexit extension, despite the fact that he repeatedly and categorically said that he would not do this. This is a bogus argument, as the University College London\u2019s Constitution Unit explains here. Gove said that an independent inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party would start before the end of the year. Yesterday leading figures in the NHS urged politicians not to start making excessive claims about health policy during the election. That was always a vain hope, and this morning the Conservatives and Labour are engaged in a row about whether the trade deal that Boris Johnson wants to with the US would result in crippling costs for the NHS. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister and one of the Tories\u2019 most pugnacious communicators, has been doing a media round and he hit out at the Labour claim. Gove described a claim from Jeremy Corbyn that a Tory UK-US trade deal could cost the NHS \u00a3500m a week as \u201cridiculous nonsense\u201d. In his speech later this morning, according to extracts briefed in advance, Corbyn will say: Johnson stood in front of a bus and promised \u00a3350m a week for the NHS. Now we find out that \u00a3500m a week could be taken out of the NHS and handed to big drugs companies under his plans for a sell-out trade deal with Donald Trump. We now know that US and UK officials have been discussing drug pricing in secret and the US government is demanding \u201cfull market access for US products.\u201d Senior NHS managers have said that would mean \u201chigher prices for medicines\u201d which will \u201cpass on costs to both patients and the NHS\u201d. Responding to this claim Gove told BBC Breakfast: It is the most ridiculous nonsense I have ever heard in my 52 years on this earth. It is a fantasy. It is a figure plucked from thin air in order to try to distract attention from the weakness of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s position on Brexit. We have made it perfectly clear drug prices won\u2019t be going up. Jeremy Corbyn is attempting to perpetuate Halloween into November by telling ghost stories that frankly no one believes. For a good analysis of what to make of these competing claims, I recommend this analysis from my colleague Denis Campbell. There were several other striking lines in Gove\u2019s morning interviews. I will post a full summary shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Jeremy Corbyn delivers a speech on Brexit in Harlow. 10am: Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, launches her party\u2019s election campaign in Westminster. 11am: Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, campaigns in Bolsover. Later he will be in Ashfield. 1.20pm: Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and SNP leader, campaigns in Dalkeith. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on general election developments. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

During the 1990s, Surkov worked for the oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky.</p> <p>Thornberry also cited the \u201cdubious activities\u201d of the Conservative Friends of Russia, a pro-Kremlin parliamentary group run out of the Russian embassy by Sergey Nalobin, an alleged foreign intelligence spy, who spent five years cultivating relationships with senior Conservatives.</p> <p>In response, Christopher Pincher, a Foreign Office minister, accused Thornberry of engaging in a \u201crundown of interesting smears and conspiracy theories\u201d and said it was \u201crather rich for her to suggest that the Conservative party and this government is somehow linked to Russian disinformation, given the way her own party leadership has acted\u201d.</p> <p>Grieve warned MPs the dossier would now not be published until the committee reformed under the new government \u201cand, in 2017, that took six months\u201d.</p> <p>In a later statement, he said he was \u201cextremely disappointed and baffled as to why the government has not given a reason why the report cannot be published\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis has been a standard process, right up until the point that the prime minister \u2013 against the advice of the agencies themselves \u2013 stopped us from publishing.

      "bodyText": "The widow of Alexander Litvinenko has said Boris Johnson should not have suppressed the parliamentary report on Russian interference in British politics, saying the delay helps the Kremlin and feeds suspicions of a cynical government \u201ccover-up\u201d. Marina Litvinenko said the prime minister was in danger of making the same \u201cmistake\u201d as Theresa May, who as home secretary refused to hold a public inquiry into her husband\u2019s murder in 2006 by polonium poisoning in central London. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed. We saw the same thing in my husband\u2019s case,\u201d she said, as the deadline passed for clearing the keenly awaited intelligence and security committee (ISC) report on Russia for publication before the general election. Two Kremlin assassins poisoned Alexander Litvinenko, who was an FSB officer turned dissident, with a radioactive cup of tea. It took almost a decade before a public inquiry concluded the Russian state was responsible, in an operation \u201cprobably approved\u201d by Vladimir Putin personally. Litvinenko said on Tuesday: \u201cPutin\u2019s goal is to create chaos and instability. He wants to interfere in elections in the US and Europe. The report makes recommendations to protect our system. By delaying, it looks like we are playing the same game. Putin can say we\u2019re no different.\u201d She said May\u2019s refusal to publicise the facts surroundings her husband\u2019s state-sponsored killing emboldened Moscow. Last year, Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned with novichok in Salisbury \u2013 a plot May blamed on Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency. \u201cWe have another crime,\u201d Litvinenko pointed out. The ISC report had been due to be published early this week and was awaiting its final clearance from Downing Street to check it contained no classified national security material. But on Monday No 10 refused to give its approval before parliament dissolved on Tuesday, prompting the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, to ask: \u201cWhat have you got to hide?\u201d The ISC chairman, Dominic Grieve, warned that the critical dossier may not appear until six months after the December election. The dossier, the product of 18 months\u2019 work which was supported by research from Britain\u2019s spy agencies and third-party experts, examines the threat posed by Russia to the UK, including its subversion and penetration of political institutions, plus Russian killings on British soil and the danger to British allies. Ministers have struggled to justify the withholding of the report, with Michael Gove, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, saying only that the report \u201cwould be published in due course\u201d and seeking instead to criticise Labour. During an emergency Commons debate on Tuesday on the failure to release the report, Thornberry said the decision invited suspicion: \u201cThey realise that this report will lead to other questions about the links between Russia and Brexit and the current leadership of the Tory party, which risks derailing their election campaign.\u201d Thornberry said that during three \u201cmysterious\u201d years in Russia, Johnson\u2019s key aide, Dominic Cummings, had \u201callegedly forged\u201d relationships with prominent Russians, including Vladislav Surkov, the Kremlin\u2019s chief ideologist, whom she described as \u201cthe power behind Vladimir Putin\u2019s throne\u201d. Surkov, currently serving as Putin\u2019s personal adviser, is credited with inventing the term \u201csovereign democracy\u201d to describe Russia\u2019s authoritarian system. The US imposed sanctions on him in 2014 after Russia\u2019s invasion and occupation of Crimea. During the 1990s, Surkov worked for the oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Thornberry also cited the \u201cdubious activities\u201d of the Conservative Friends of Russia, a pro-Kremlin parliamentary group run out of the Russian embassy by Sergey Nalobin, an alleged foreign intelligence spy, who spent five years cultivating relationships with senior Conservatives. In response, Christopher Pincher, a Foreign Office minister, accused Thornberry of engaging in a \u201crundown of interesting smears and conspiracy theories\u201d and said it was \u201crather rich for her to suggest that the Conservative party and this government is somehow linked to Russian disinformation, given the way her own party leadership has acted\u201d. Grieve warned MPs the dossier would now not be published until the committee reformed under the new government \u201cand, in 2017, that took six months\u201d. In a later statement, he said he was \u201cextremely disappointed and baffled as to why the government has not given a reason why the report cannot be published\u201d. \u201cThis has been a standard process, right up until the point that the prime minister \u2013 against the advice of the agencies themselves \u2013 stopped us from publishing. This must not be allowed to happen again,\u201d Grieve said. \u201cWe cannot have a situation in which a committee of parliament is not able to share its findings with parliament and the wider public. I expect our successors on the committee will rewrite the procedures to ensure this does not occur in future.\u201d Downing Street was left isolated in the Commons, with the vast majority of MPs on both sides calling for the document to be published. Keith Simpson, a Conservative ISC member, said: \u201cThis report has been cleared by the intelligence and security agencies\u201d and \u201ccivil servants and officials saw no reason why this should not be published\u201d. The 50-page dossier was submitted to Downing Street on 17 October for Johnson\u2019s approval and the committee\u2019s expectation was that it would receive political clearance last week so it could be published on Monday. When pressed by MPs, Pincher would not say whether Johnson had read the report, but insisted that it often took longer than 10 days for final political sign off.",

Successive parliaments have shown a shaming inability to find cross-party unity in dealing with the crisis in social care, which will deepen as the population ages. When it comes to the climate emergency, optimistic dates for achieving net-zero emissions targets have been set by all the main parties, but the roadmap to that outcome remains vague at best. Meanwhile, our first-past-the-post voting system continues to distort election outcomes, creating seats so safe that the vitality is sucked out of local democracy and parliamentary majorities are delivered by a minority share of the vote. Online, hopes that the digital age might unleash a new era of participatory democracy have given way to concern over the bullying, violent tone of much debate and the effect of unregulated political content on Facebook and other platforms. Confronted with huge challenges, Britain needs a better, more inclusive and less polarised debate. The call from organisations across civil society to rethink and reform the way we do politics, published in the Guardian this week, is therefore welcome. The signatories, including the Equality Trust and the Electoral Reform Society, advocate the formation of a special people\u2019s assembly \u2013 a citizens\u2019 convention \u2013 after the election. Its members would be selected at random, as for jury service. They would convene over the course of two years, before making proposals on democratic and constitutional reform. Parliament would be mandated to act on their recommendations. The merits of this kind of approach have already been demonstrated in Ireland, where a randomly selected assembly of 99 citizens met over an 18-month period and came to a consensus on the first reforms to abortion laws for 35 years. Their proposals were accepted by parliament and eventually endorsed by the public, in a referendum notable for the civility with which it was conducted. Ruth Fox, the director of the Hansard Society, has warned that \u201cthe public reputation of parliament and MPs is at a nadir\u201d. A special assembly, running in tandem with the new parliament, could help detoxify troubled times and provide a bridge between Westminster and the public. Most importantly, by creating the circumstances for informed dialogue between people from diverse backgrounds holding different views, it could showcase the political virtues of tolerance and compromise. MPs have already committed to part-funding a citizens\u2019 assembly on the climate emergency next year. The next government should go further and take forward the proposal of a constitutional convention.",

Is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/04/facebook-exempts-political-ads-ban-making-false-claims\" title=\"\">Facebook wrong to refuse to factcheck political messaging</a>? Is it possible to have free and fair elections when social media allows for the mass dissemination of misleading information and the micro-targeting of propaganda?</p> <p>Such discussions are obviously necessary. But we should not miss the wood for the trees. It isn\u2019t just highly targeted <em>political</em> advertising that is threatening our democracy, it\u2019s highly targeted advertising full stop. As David Heinemeier Hansson, the founder of programming language Ruby on Rails, recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1189643706300657664?s=20\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>: \u201cThe debate over targeted political advertisement [sic] keeps dancing tantalisingly close to the eventual conclusion: NO ADVERTISEMENT SHOULD BE TARGETED ON PERSONAL INFORMATION!\u201d</p> <p>Hear, hear! The advertising industry (in which I have worked for many years) takes it for granted that the more an ad is targeted the better. It\u2019s better for the consumer because, instead of seeing irrelevant products, they get something they are interested in \u2013 backpacks not hatchbacks. It\u2019s better for the brand because it optimises its media spend. This is gospel. If you tried to argue that you should ignore the wealth of personal data at your fingertips and go back to simple context-centric targeting \u2013 putting ads for cars, for example, on car-related websites rather than targeting individual car enthusiasts \u2013 you would be laughed out of the building.</p> <p>But personalised adverts are not better for anyone. They have turned the internet into a surveillance nightmare.

      "bodyText": "We have been arguing about political advertising on social media ad nauseam recently. Should it be regulated? Is Twitter right to ban political ads from its platform? Is Facebook wrong to refuse to factcheck political messaging? Is it possible to have free and fair elections when social media allows for the mass dissemination of misleading information and the micro-targeting of propaganda? Such discussions are obviously necessary. But we should not miss the wood for the trees. It isn\u2019t just highly targeted political advertising that is threatening our democracy, it\u2019s highly targeted advertising full stop. As David Heinemeier Hansson, the founder of programming language Ruby on Rails, recently tweeted: \u201cThe debate over targeted political advertisement [sic] keeps dancing tantalisingly close to the eventual conclusion: NO ADVERTISEMENT SHOULD BE TARGETED ON PERSONAL INFORMATION!\u201d Hear, hear! The advertising industry (in which I have worked for many years) takes it for granted that the more an ad is targeted the better. It\u2019s better for the consumer because, instead of seeing irrelevant products, they get something they are interested in \u2013 backpacks not hatchbacks. It\u2019s better for the brand because it optimises its media spend. This is gospel. If you tried to argue that you should ignore the wealth of personal data at your fingertips and go back to simple context-centric targeting \u2013 putting ads for cars, for example, on car-related websites rather than targeting individual car enthusiasts \u2013 you would be laughed out of the building. But personalised adverts are not better for anyone. They have turned the internet into a surveillance nightmare. The fact that marketers are able to serve me ads for yoga mats the moment after I\u2019ve booked a yoga class is not worth trading my privacy for. It\u2019s not worth being stalked online by a yoga mat I once clicked on. It\u2019s not worth having my every move analysed by a million activity trackers. It\u2019s not worth having my phone battery drained by the data-guzzling ads that render many parts of the internet borderline unnavigable. And it\u2019s unclear how effective personalised ads are. The digital advertising ecosystem is riddled with fraud and there is very little transparency around where online ad revenue goes. Facebook is reportedly about to pay millions in a settlement after inflating its video viewership metrics. And Comscore, one of the main firms responsible for measuring digital advertising success, was recently charged with falsely reporting its revenue and misreporting customer numbers.

He has triggered and presided over a transformation of the Tories into a rightwing nationalist party. What was once a broadly based movement of the centre-right is now a political sect, defined by a single issue, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>, which increasingly places the party on the wrong side of history. The exodus this week of centrist Conservative MPs who have had enough is eloquent testimony to that. The upshot, as Iain Duncan Smith boasted this week, is stark. The Tories, he said, \u201care the Brexit party now\u201d. As many have pointed out, a general election is an election about everything. Jeremy Corbyn, launching Labour\u2019s campaign on Thursday, will fight it on austerity. The SNP will fight it on Scottish independence. In Northern Ireland, the election will, as ever, be about the union. None of these is a secondary issue. Yet Duncan Smith\u2019s words identify what this election is most irrevocably about. It is about whether the UK will leave the EU and end its commitment to Europe, or whether it will not. If the Conservatives form the next government, Johnson will move quickly to get his Brexit deal into law. Yet his deal is worse than Mrs May\u2019s and far worse than Britain\u2019s current terms of membership. By 2029 the economy would be 4% smaller than it is forecast to be if Britain remains. Scotland could be pushed out of the UK and the Irish peace process destroyed. The Tory right, strengthened by this week\u2019s retirements, will be within touching distance of the small-state, light-regulation Britain they crave. These things could be the realities of 2020s Britain if Johnson wins next month. The task on 12 December is to stop him.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Top tweet</h2> <p>A political scientist explains why it would be foolish for anyone to predict the election outcome:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GoodwinMJ/status/1191349936568360961\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Treat constituency polls with pinch of salt but this points to complexity of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ge2019?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ge2019</a><br><br>Portsmouth South, currently Labour marginal, goes LibDem while Brexit Party probably costs Conservatives a gain <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Libdem?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Libdem</a> 30% (+13)<br>Con 27% (-14)<br>Lab 24% (-17)<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a> Party 14% (-)<br><br>Survation</p>&mdash; Matthew Goodwin (@GoodwinMJ) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GoodwinMJ/status/1191349936568360961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 4, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>",

Top stories After reluctantly accepting the EU\u2019s offer of a 31 January Brexit extension and falling short of a two-thirds majority for an election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, Boris Johnson abandoned all attempts to get his Brexit deal through the Commons. Instead, the prime minister tabled a short bill to change the law in order to hold a poll on 12 December \u2013 a move that would require only a simple majority and so could be passed with the backing of the Liberal Democrats or the Scottish National party. In the event, both abstained after their preferred date of 9 December was rejected \u2013 but the Labour party, declaring the opportunity a \u201conce-in-a-generation chance to transform our country\u201d, backed it and it sailed through by 438 votes to 20. At the fourth time of asking \u2013 and rather than granting MPs more time to scrutinise an agreement that they had passed with a majority of 30 at second reading \u2013 Johnson had the election he wanted, Britain\u2019s first December poll since 1923. The prime minister warned his forces it was going to be a hard campaign, however, and got an early reminder of just how hard when Nigel Farage gave him a two-week deadline to drop his Brexit deal or face a Brexit party candidate in every seat. With Farage\u2019s party plainly set to challenge the Conservatives for every leave vote it can, Johnson felt the need to apologise to Tory members for not taking Britain out of the EU on 31 October \u2013 as he had promised to do \u201ccome what may\u201d. He also is unlikely to have welcomed the public interventions in the UK campaign of Donald Trump, who has twice said he hopes the prime minister, a \u201cwonderful guy\u201d, and Farage should come together on a united political platform. Labour, which is promising to negotiate a new deal with Brussels within three months if it wins and put it to a referendum in six, is determined for once to show unity: \u201cThe debate on Brexit is over,\u201d Jeremy Corbyn told his fractious shadow cabinet. Polls, meanwhile, put the Conservatives well ahead (although they did so, too, of course, in 2017). But tactical voting could be a game-changer, with the People\u2019s Vote campaign preparing to start spending a \u00a31m war chest despite a continuing conflict within the organisation. What next Most serious analysts and commentators warn strenuously that voter volatility, the revival of the anti-Brexit Lib Dems, the emergence of the pro-no-deal Brexit party and \u2013 as ever \u2013 the unpredictable effects of Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system mean this will be an election of quite exceptional complexity.

Johnson \u201cknew about Vote Leave\u2019s illegal overspend\u201d, says MP. Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal \u201cwould cost UK economy \u00a370bn\u201d. Brexit uncertainty hits UK manufacturing sector. End anxiety of UK citizens in EU, government urged. Sinn F\u00e9in to stand aside for remain candidates in three constituencies. Top comment The Guardian\u2019s editorial said the election would be all about Brexit, whose future now rests on the result of the general election in six weeks\u2019 time: Boris Johnson has had a major impact on his party. He has triggered and presided over a transformation of the Tories into a rightwing nationalist party. What was once a broadly based movement of the centre-right is now a political sect, defined by a single issue, Brexit, which increasingly places the party on the wrong side of history.

Yet his deal is worse than Mrs May\u2019s and far worse than Britain\u2019s current terms of membership. By 2029 the economy would be 4% smaller than it is forecast to be if Britain remains. Scotland could be pushed out of the UK and the Irish peace process destroyed. The Tory right, strengthened by this week\u2019s retirements, will be within touching distance of the small-state, light-regulation Britain they crave. These things could be the realities of 2020s Britain if Johnson wins next month. The task on 12 December is to stop him.

In the other main internal House of Commons elections, for select committee chairs, they use the alternative vote.</p> \n  <p>The fact that they are not using first past the post (FPTP), the system used in the UK to elect MPs, might be seen as evidence that FPTP is not ideal and that there are much better voting systems available. But all the MPs who sit in the Commons have managed to get there via FPTP, and the arguments for replacing are rarely heard at the moment. (In fact, in the election campaign so far,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/01/general-election-news-latest-brexit-farage-restates-call-for-brexit-party-pact-with-tories-live-news?page=with:block-5dbc0ae58f08c428d8934a2d#block-5dbc0ae58f08c428d8934a2d\"> the only party making a big issue of electoral reform is the Brexit party.)</a></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc0517a8f0878b83f8e96f3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-04T16:51:50.766Z\">4.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Can anyone now beat Lindsay Hoyle?</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Probably not.</p> \n  <p>There are now just 22 new votes up for grabs. Even if all of them go to Rosie Winterton, assuming no other changes, she would not catch Harriet Harman, and so there must be a strong chance of her dropping out after the next round of voting.</p> \n  <p>That would free up 68 votes - almost all the 70 that Hoyle would need to win. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/04/general-election-news-latest-health-chief-urge-parties-not-to-use-nhs-as-political-weapon-live-news?page=with:block-5dc04dab8f087217cbe97394#block-5dc04dab8f087217cbe97394\">4.20am.)</a></p> \n  <p>Of course, they won\u2019t all go to Hoyle. But it would be fair to assume that quite a few at least of the votes for Hillier and Winterton (both Labour MPs) will go to Hoyle (also a Labour MP).</p> \n  <p>But Hillier and Winterton are also women, and many MPs may understandably be motivated by a desire to see another woman as Speaker, for only the second time in history.</p> \n  <p>This could be Eleanor Laing\u2019s best route to victory. But is it a plausible one? Even if she were to pick up all the Hillier votes, and all the Winterton votes, and then all the Harriet Harman ones, she would still only be on 241 votes - 41 short of the 282 threshold.</p> \n  <p>There are scenarios you can imagine which might see someone overhauling Hoyle. But, unlike a party leadership election, this isn\u2019t one of those ballots where people will switch to backing another candidate for personal advancement. It is a secret ballot, and even if MPs do tell the person who eventually wins they are backing their cause, there is little they will gain from the Speaker\u2019s patronage. He or she does not appoint a cabinet.</p> \n  <p>And switching of this kind only normally happens in an election where voting is driven by a strong desire to block a particular candidate. But Hoyle does not inspire that sort of feelings in MPs. He is well liked, and he is easily acceptable to the house as a whole. We are not expecting to see an operation to scupper his chances.</p> \n  <p>In other words, it is very hard to see how he does not end up as Speaker by the end of the day.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc051f48f087217cbe973ef\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-04T16:31:35.975Z\">4.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Ken Clarke tells MPs that no candidate is dropping out.</p> \n  <p>He says the new ballot papers will be printed.</p> \n  <p>Labour\u2019s John Speller complains.

The party will stand aside in South Belfast, East Belfast and North Down. As the Press Association reports, Sinn Fein president <strong>Mary Lou McDonald</strong> urged supporters to instead back the SDLP, the Alliance party and independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon respectively in those three seats.</p> \n  <p>Announcing the move, McDonald said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In many ways this is a once-in-a-generation election, the stakes are very high in this election. People have a fundamental choice to make - to vote for a positive, inclusive future or to turn their backs on that and to back candidates who have been the architects of Brexit and who have acted very, very deliberately against the democratic wishes of people here in the north and more fundamentally against the economic and social interests of citizens who live here.</p> \n   <p>You can call this a pact, you can call it what you wish - the reality is we are asking people to come out and vote for those pro-Remain candidates. We believe that is the right and progressive thing to do.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>What is novel, and striking, about today\u2019s announcement is the plan for Sinn Fein to stand aside to help Lady Sylvia Hermon. Hermon now sits as an independent, but she is a unionist, she was first elected to parliament as an Ulster Unionist party MP and she is the widow of Sir Jack Hermon, a former chief constable of the RUC.</p> \n  <p>Karen Bradley, the former Northern Ireland secretary, was widely mocked last year when she admitted that, before she took on the job, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/07/karen-bradley-admits-not-understanding-northern-irish-politics\">she did not realise that nationalists in Northern Ireland don\u2019t vote for unionists.</a> \u201cI didn\u2019t understand things like when elections are fought, for example, in Northern Ireland \u2013 people who are nationalists don\u2019t vote for unionist parties and vice versa,\u201d she said. She was deemed ignorant because for years in Northern Ireland the unionist/nationalist divide has trumped everything.</p> \n  <p>But today\u2019s announcement from Sinn Fein shows that in some parts of Northern Ireland (but not all - see my colleague Rory Carroll at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/04/general-election-news-latest-health-chief-urge-parties-not-to-use-nhs-as-political-weapon-live-news?page=with:block-5dc0194c8f08cb84c60a4532#block-5dc0194c8f08cb84c60a4532\">12.30pm)</a> these rigidities are starting to crack.

This means in theory there could be up to five rounds of voting. But any candidate with less than 5% of votes cast also drops out, and in practice candidates who realise they are not going to win also tend to quit voluntarily. In 2009, when MPs last elected a Speaker, there were 10 candidates but only three rounds of voting. It would be surprising if it goes beyond that this time, and so the final result should come by around 6.30pm.

Here is an extract from<a href=\"https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/XT-20024-2019-REV-2/en/pdf\"> the official EU statement (pdf) </a>agreeing the extension. If parliament were to pass the Brexit deal in time, the UK could leave the EU on 1 January. It says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The European council recalls that, under article 50(3) TEU, the withdrawal agreement may enter into force on an earlier date, should the parties complete their respective ratification procedures before the end of the period under article 50(3) TEU. Consequently, the withdrawal should take place on the first day of the month following the completion of the ratification procedures or on 1 February 2020, whichever is the earliest.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10267938/boris-johnson-vote-tory-brexit/\">an interview with the Sun on Sunday</a>, <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> suggested that, in the event of the Tories winning the election, Brexit could happen by Christmas. The story started:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Boris Johnson has revealed his \u201cfast and furious\u201d plan to get Brexit wrapped up by Christmas if he wins a decisive general election victory on December 12.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But the actual quote from Johnson was a bit less specific. He told the paper:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve got a deal that\u2019s ready to go and if we can get it right with a new parliament we will move quickly.</p> \n   <p>Our new MPs will come back the following day and we will bang it through. We\u2019ll get Brexit done very, very fast and avoid another infinite period of dither and delay.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And, in practice, Johnson\u2019s \u201cBrexit by Christmas\u201d pledge will probably turn out to be as reliable as his \u201cdo or die\u201d one to deliver Brexit by 31 October because it is very hard to imagine the Brexit agreement being passed before Christmas. </p> \n  <p>MPs will not be able to return to the Commons \u201cthe following day\u201d after the election because the counting will not finish in some constituencies until late Friday. Then, when MPs do return to the Commons at the start of a new parliament, it normally takes a few days for them all to take the oath before any legislating can actually start.

The NHS is always a key election issue, of course, but there are at least two reasons why it is set to be more salient than usual this year. First, we are having an unusual December election, which means hospitals are under more pressure than they are when people normally go to the polls in the spring. And, second, this is an election where both main parties think they can win on health. Normally the Tories cede this issue to Labour, but Boris Johnson has decided to put the NHS at the top of his agenda (he believes that the Vote Leave bus slogan means he is obliged to champion health spending) and<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7643425/Boris-Johnsons-opens-big-lead-Jeremy-Corbyn-NHS.html\"> some polling </a>shows that he is trusted more on health than Jeremy Corbyn, which is an unusual feat for a Tory leader.</p> \n  <p>In<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/lets-keep-promises-to-save-the-nhs-out-of-this-election-2tr035890\"> an article in the Times (paywall)</a> Carrie MacEwen, chairwoman of the <strong>Academy of Medical Royal Colleges</strong>, says that any public debate about the NHS needs to be based on \u201crealistic expectations\u201d and that the general election makes this unlikely. She says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have already had a taste of what may be ahead. Labour has claimed that a nationalised drugs company would \u201cmake medicines cheaper\u201d. But who is going to fund the research for new drugs? The Conservatives claimed \u201cfunding for 40 new hospitals\u201d, making it disappointing to learn that in fact money had been allocated to just six.</p> \n   <p>This is easy electioneering aimed at a soft target. Undeliverable promises simply set the NHS up to fail. And this is at a time when it is actually on a long-overdue path to success.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And in<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/please-dont-turn-the-nhs-into-a-political-weapon-tghsn6hbp\"> an article for the Times\u2019 Red Box website (paywall) </a>Chris Hopson, chief executive of <strong>NHS Providers</strong>, which represents hospitals and other health trust organisations, makes a similar point. He says having the NHS as a dominant election issue could be counterproductive. He explains:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This political potency is often helpful for the NHS. But it becomes counter-productive when the NHS is used as a political weapon. Frontline NHS leaders are worried that is already starting to happen in this election.</p> \n   <p>Of course we need to be open and honest about where the health service is falling short. It is clear that, despite treating many more patients than ever before, the NHS is falling back against key targets for A and E, cancer care and diagnostic tests.</p> \n   <p>Waiting lists for operations have climbed to nearly four and a half million and the pressures on our mental health, community and ambulance services are just as great. However hard the NHS frontline works, it can\u2019t seem to keep up with growing demand.</p> \n   <p>This is particularly worrying with winter looming. But as pressures on the NHS intensify in the coming weeks, over-dramatising or distorting the difficulties for political ends will do nothing to help those frontline staff who are working flat out for patients. Equally, disingenuous claims about extra funding, or promises that create unrealistic expectations, may be tempting in the heat of the election battle, but they do the health service no favours.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>These are understandable arguments, but there seems to be little chance of their having much impact on the campaign. Rightly or wrongly, electioneering is always drawn towards hyperbole. </p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> \n  <p><em>10am: </em>John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, meet NHS staff at Unison HQ in London.</p> \n  <p><em>10.30am:</em> Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader, and Liz Saville Roberts, its leader at Westminster, launch Plaid\u2019s election campaign.</p> \n  <p><em>2pm: </em>Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, unveils the party\u2019s 600 election candidates.</p> \n  <p><em>2.30pm:</em> MPs start the process of electing a new Speaker. </p> \n  <p>As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on general election developments and on the election of a new Speaker.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us this evening \u2013 thanks for reading and commenting. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Dan Sabbagh and Luke Harding have tonight\u2019s main story: Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: Sir Lindsay Hoyle was confirmed as the new Commons Speaker, succeeding John Bercow. Hoyle won the election after four rounds of voting eliminated the other six candidates. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, lied during the Brexit referendum campaign, the outgoing president of the European commission said. Jean-Claude Juncker made the accusation in an interview with the German newspaper Der Spiegel, in which he also said pro-European politicians, including his friend Tony Blair, had helped lay Brexit\u2019s foundations. Opposition party leaders complained about their exclusion from a head-to-head election debate, with the Lib Dems\u2019 Jo Swinson claiming the decision relating her could be motivated by sexism. Swinson said the people choosing to exclude her from the ITV event could be \u201csexist\u201d, or \u201cscared\u201d, or both. The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon also warned broadcasters to reflect politics \u201cas it is and not just how you want it to be\u201d. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, insisted his party would hurt Labour as he sought to play down the threat to the Tories. Nevertheless, Jacob Rees-Mogg called on Farage to \u201cretire from the field\u201d, citing his concern that the Brexit party could snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by splitting the leave-friendly vote. Sinn F\u00e9in was among the parties to stand down in some Northern Irish constituencies to make way for remain-friendly candidates. Perhaps most notably, the party\u2019s move opened a path to victory for one unionist candidate: the independent MP, Silvia Hermon. The nationalist SDLP also agreed to stand aside in some contests for a similar reason. Elsewhere, fragile unionist pacts were shaken \u2013 but held. Senior figures in the health service expressed alarm that the NHS was being used as a \u201cpolitical weapon\u201d. They called for public debate about the NHS to be based on \u201crealistic expectations\u201d. Plaid Cymru kicked off its election campaign, accusing Boris Johnson of being \u201cresolutely dishonest\u201d. Adam Price, the party\u2019s leader, also said Jeremy Corbyn had been \u201csadly proven ... clueless\u201d. The party put Welsh independence at the centre of its programme. The former Labour MP, John Woodcock, announced he will not stand for reelection. Woodcock is standing down because he and his partner are having a baby. LBC has confirmed that the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, will not host his radio show during the general election campaign, saying the step is designed to ensure compliance with Ofcom rules. Farage actually addressed the issue as he closed his show last week, saying that remaining a broadcaster and the leader of a political party during an election campaign would \u201cclearly\u201d mean he would \u201chave a bit of a conflict\u201d. The prime minister has written to the opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, demanding that he set out his position on Brexit and accusing him of wanting to \u201cgo back to square one\u201d on the issue. Boris Johnson, who himself voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal twice \u2013 before eventually backing it at the third attempt, claimed Jeremy Corbyn had blocked his Brexit deal when it came before the Commons. While Labour voted against the bill that would have implemented the deal, it passed its second reading in the Commons. Rather than being blocked, it was in fact pulled by the prime minister after MPs refused to allow him to rush it through parliament. Accusing the Labour leader of spending \u201cconsiderable time and energy seeking to undermine the [Brexit] negotiations\u201d, Johnson said Corbyn has also \u201csought to avoid\u201d setting out a clear Brexit plan of his own: Your current position seems to be that you want to go back to square one. You want to throw out the great new deal we have reached with our European friends and, instead, negotiate a whole new treaty from scratch. Even assuming the EU agrees to go back to the very beginning, this will take months and possibly years to do \u2013 under your proposals, 2020 will be lost to more dither and delay over Brexit. Voters also have the right to know: What would your supposed Brexit \u2018deal\u2019 actually take back control of? For months, you have refused to say what sort of \u2018deal\u2019 you want with the EU. Now the time has come for you to come clean, and explain what your plan really is so when the public vote on 12 December, they know what they are voting for. Speaking to the Guardian today, Corbyn sought to set out his stance on Brexit, saying the party would negotiate a new deal with Brussels \u2013 including a closer trading relationship \u2013 within three months and put it to the public in a referendum within six. He has insisted Labour will stick to the plan not to declare a possible referendum position until after the election: Two of the 540 votes cast were spoiled, Clarke told MPs. Looking at the numbers, while Bryant again increased his vote by the greater proportion of the two candidates \u2013 about 26% \u2013 Hoyle almost kept pace with him; increasing his own by about 22%, having started from a much higher base. In the end, it wasn\u2019t that close. Hoyle\u2019s winning margin of 112 represented more than half of Bryant\u2019s total number of final round votes: 213. It is true, of course, to say there is no base from which to start, with each MP being free to switch their support between rounds \u2013 even if their previously preferred candidate is still in the race. But, while each candidate does indeed start from zero in each round, it\u2019s reasonable to assume a large proportion stuck with their candidate. Back in March 2013, shortly after Hoyle successfully presided over a \u201cboisterous budget day\u201d, the Guardian\u2019s former political editor Michael White profiled the then deputy speaker. Hoyle\u2019s handling of those proceedings, White wrote, had made him a \u201cparliamentary star in pinstripes\u201d. Here\u2019s how Hoyle saw it: So once a year it\u2019s my day. I\u2019m in charge and I look forward to it. It\u2019s a highlight, the biggest day of the parliamentary year. The mood in the chamber is electric, you can feel the tension. Here\u2019s a little more from Hoyle\u2019s moving tribute to his daughter, delivered from the Speaker\u2019s chair in the Commons chamber. He told MPs: There is one person who\u2019s not here: My daughter, Natalie. I wish she\u2019d have been here, we all miss her as a family; no more so than her mum. I\u2019ve got to say, she was everything to all of us. She will always be missed but she will always be in our thoughts. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said Hoyle would \u201cstand up for the principle\u201d of parliamentary democracy\u201d. He added: The job of Speaker is not just a ceremonial one. It is about the rights of backbenchers to be able to speak up. It is about the power of parliament to hold the government to account. That is the whole principle and point of a parliamentary democracy; that we have a strong parliament that can hold the executive to account. And I know you will stand up for that principle because that is what you believe in. Here\u2019s a little more on the comments made by the prime minister after Hoyle took the Speaker\u2019s chair. He said: Mr Speaker, in congratulating you on your election I observe that you have prevailed over an extremely strong field and that every other candidate earlier on spoke forcibly and well. Speaking for myself, after long, happy years of dealing with you, I think I know what it is. And let me say, whenever any of us is preparing to speak in this chamber, we all know there is a moment between standing up and when the Speaker calls you when your heart is in your mouth. And, in that moment of anxiety about whether you\u2019re going to make a fool of yourself and so on and indeed at the moment when we sit down amid deafening silence, the kindliness of the Speaker is absolutely critical to our confidence and the way we behave. And, Mr Speaker, over the years I have observed that you have many good qualities and I\u2019m sure you will stick up for backbenchers in the way that you have proposed and I\u2019m sure that you will adhere to a strict Newtonian concept of time in PMQs. But I believe you will also bring your signature kindness, kindness and reasonableness to our proceedings, and thereby to help to bring us together as a Parliament and a democracy. Because, no matter how fiercely we may disagree, we know that every member comes to this place with the best of motives, determined to solve, to serve the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world. And, to achieve our goals by the peaceable arts of reason and debate invigilated by an impartial Speaker, which was and remains one of our greatest gifts to the world. Thank you Mr Speaker, and congratulations. Dame Eleanor Laing, who was eliminated after the third round of voting, has tweeted her congratulations to Hoyle: And she has been joined in so doing by a host of parliamentary colleagues: In his speech, Hoyle also paid tribute to Clarke, telling MPs: I stand by what I said, I stand firm, that I hope this House will be once a great respected House, not just in here but across the world. It\u2019s the envy and we\u2019ve got to make sure that tarnish is polished away, that the respect and tolerance that we expect from everyone who works in here will be shown and we\u2019ll keep that in order. Boris Johnson rises to thank Clarke and congratulate Hoyle. He says the new Speaker \u201cprevailed over an extremely strong field\u201d. He adds that he believes it was Hoyle\u2019s \u201csignature kindness\u201d towards MPs that led his colleagues to elect him. Jeremy Corbyn adds his own congratulations to Hoyle and thanks to Clarke, saying the former will need eyes in the back of his head. He jokes about the photograph posted online at the weekend of Hoyle \u201capparently watching the rugby cup final while, at the same time, not watching the television\u201d. The image, Corbyn suggests, may be evidence that Hoyle does indeed have the requisite qualification for the job. Hoyle is dragged to the chair in the traditional way by Caroline Flint and Nigel Evans and begins his remarks by thanking the other candidates. He jokes that there should be no clapping; one of the issues Bryant placed at the heart of his campaign. And Hoyle pays tribute to his daughter Natalie Lewis-Hoyle, who died in 2017 and whom he says his family misses a great deal. Hoyle closes by saying he does not want to detain MPs any longer and says the House will change for the better. For the first time, the new Speaker calls the prime minister to the dispatch box. Sir Lindsay Hoyle has been elected as the next Commons Speaker, replacing John Bercow. The favourite beat Chris Bryant by 112 votes in the fourth and final round, having already seen off Dame Eleanor Laing, Harriet Harman and Dame Rosie Winterton, as well as Sir Edward Leigh and Meg Hillier, in earlier rounds. In total, 540 MPs voted in the final round; 25 fewer than in the previous one. Here are the results (with those from the previous rounds in brackets, beginning with the more recent): Sir Lindsay Hoyle: 325 (267, 244 and 211) Chris Bryant 213 (169, 120 and 98) The Father of the House, Ken Clarke, has returned to the chamber and, it appears, is about to announce the results of the final round of voting in the election of the next Speaker. Jeremy Corbyn will visit a 10th Tory-held target seat since the general election was called last Tuesday in a deliberate signal that Labour is determined to fight an attacking campaign, despite the anxieties of some of its MPs, my colleague Heather Stewart writes. In Harlow, in Essex, he will give a speech about Brexit, following visits to a string of other areas, including Putney, Milton Keynes and Crawley. He will head north later in the week, when parliament has been dissolved. Party strategists claim to have drawn up a list of almost 100 seats that could be within their sights, notwithstanding the Conservatives\u2019 comfortable poll lead. All three candidates appear to have benefited from the previous round\u2019s eliminations but Bryant saw the greatest increase in support from the second round to the third. Chris Bryant: An increase of 49 votes, or about 40% Sir Lindsay Hoyle: An increase of 23 votes, or about 9% Dame Eleanor Laing: An increase of 5 votes, or about 4% There were two spoiled votes, Clarke tells the Commons, and 10 fewer MPs cast their ballot in this latest round than in the second. Bryant is 98 short of Hoyle\u2019s total. So, should a significant proportion of those who voted for Laing stick around and switch to him, Bryant could yet overhaul the favourite. There is another way of looking at that, of course: *Please note: I put a set of brackets in the wrong place in the previous post, giving an incorrect figure for Chris Bryant\u2019s latest level of support. I\u2019ve corrected it but you may need to refresh your screen to see the accurate results. The Father of the House, Ken Clarke, has returned to his seat in the Commons and is announcing the results. Here they are (with the second round\u2019s results in brackets): Sir Lindsay Hoyle 267 (244) Chris Bryant 169 (120) Dame Eleanor Laing 127 (122) Laing is eliminated, Clarke says. Bryant and Hoyle will go through to a final round. The Guardian has just published its editorial on Labour\u2019s general election campaign, saying Corbyn\u2019s plans are \u201crequired to repair the damage caused by a system that is being run in favour of privileged individuals whose market and political power allows them to extract cash from everyone else\u201d. Labour aims to radically transform Britain; it is a change that is long overdue. The public are quite rightly fed up with the idea that an economic bloodletting is a necessary purgative after the excesses of a boom. Labour recognised this in 2017 and reaped the benefit. Since then, the Tories have sought to claim that they have fixed the economy \u2013 and therefore they can go some way to matching Labour\u2019s spending pledges, at least in the election campaign. If ending austerity means ditching self-imposed fiscal targets, Boris Johnson reasons, so be it. Yet the public is entitled to ask why the state was in so many areas deliberately rolled back, reducing aggregate demand when the economy would have benefited from it. As we await the results of this round of voting, here\u2019s what Parliament has to say on the office and role of the Speaker: Speakers must be politically impartial. Therefore, on election the new Speaker must resign from their political party and remain separate from political issues even in retirement. However, the Speaker will deal with their constituents\u2019 problems like a normal MP. Speakers still stand in general elections. They are generally unopposed by the major political parties, who will not field a candidate in the Speaker\u2019s constituency \u2013 this includes the original party they were a member of. During a general election, Speakers do not campaign on any political issues but simply stand as \u2018the Speaker seeking re-election\u2019. A majority of voters think Jo Swinson should be included in the ITV leaders\u2019 debate featuring Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, a YouGov poll suggests. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. In the chamber Ken Clarke has just announced that Harriet Harman is pulling out. That means there are three candidates left: Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Dame Eleanor Laing, and Chris Bryant. New ballot papers are being printed, and then the ballot opens. We should get the final result soon after 7pm. Some 575 MPs voted in the second ballot - 13 more than in the first round. Assuming they all keep voting, that means a candidate needs 288 votes to win. Sir Lindsay Hoyle is short by 44. Ken Clarke has just read out the results of the second round of voting. Here they are (with the results from the first round in brackets). Sir Lindsay Hoyle: 244 (211) Dame Eleanor Laing: 122 (113) Chris Bryant: 120 (98) Harriet Harman: 59 (72) Dame Rosie Winterton: 30 (46) Winterton has now been eliminated. Hoyle has extended his lead, but he is still short of the votes he needs. In the Commons the division bells are ringing, which means the results of the next round of voting in the election of the new Speaker will be announced soon. Sky News is now proposing a three-way leaders\u2019s debate, involving Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader. And Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and leader of the SNP, has described the decision to exclude her as \u201coutrageous\u201d. Her party has 35 MPs, while Swinson\u2019s has just 19 - and eight of those are defectors from other parties. This morning Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, got the 8.10 slot on the Today programme to discuss Labour figures showing that almost 80,000 operations were cancelled last year. Ed Conway, Sky\u2019s economics editor, has posted a good thread on Twitter explaining this figure in context. Here are the key points. More than 400,000 EU citizens living in Britain applied for settled status in the last month, in a huge surge reflecting the threat of a no-deal Brexit. The number of total applications has now passed 2.2m, up from 1.8m in September, the Home Office has said, with around 17,000 applications per day. The new total represents 64% of the estimated 3.4m EU citizens living in the UK. The rise in applications in the last four weeks reflects concerns among EU citizens that they would be left in legal limbo if the UK had crashed out of the EU as threatened by Boris Johnson on 31 October. A spokesman for the Home Office said 1.8m had received either settled status (given to those in the country for five years or more) or pre-settled status (given to those in the country for fewer than five years). Some 400,000 applications are still being processed. EU citizens and their family members have until at least 31 December 2020 to apply whatever the outcome of Brexit. If the new prime minister seals a deal that deadline will be extended to June 2021. Wales is on course for a fundamental transformation in its political landscape with Welsh Labour\u2019s dominance under threat, the first opinion poll of the campaign in the country is suggesting. The YouGov poll for ITV-Cymru Wales and Cardiff University has the Tories level with Labour in Wales while the Brexit Party is in third place and the Lib Dems have lost ground. Here are the voting intention figures (with changes on the last poll conducted last month in brackets). Labour: 29 (+4) Conservatives: 28 (-1) Brexit party: 15 (+1) Liberal Democrats: 12 (-4) Plaid Cymru: 12 (no change) Greens: 3 (-1) Others: 1 (no change) In a blog Prof Roger Awan-Scully, head of politics and international relations at Cardiff University, cautiously suggests this could lead to Labour losing 10 seats in Wales, and the Conservatives gaining nine. These are from the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush. As Bush points out, the election of the Commons Speaker is taking a while because MPs use an exhaustive ballot (successive rounds of voting, as candidates drop out). In the other main internal House of Commons elections, for select committee chairs, they use the alternative vote. The fact that they are not using first past the post (FPTP), the system used in the UK to elect MPs, might be seen as evidence that FPTP is not ideal and that there are much better voting systems available. But all the MPs who sit in the Commons have managed to get there via FPTP, and the arguments for replacing are rarely heard at the moment. (In fact, in the election campaign so far, the only party making a big issue of electoral reform is the Brexit party.) Probably not. There are now just 22 new votes up for grabs. Even if all of them go to Rosie Winterton, assuming no other changes, she would not catch Harriet Harman, and so there must be a strong chance of her dropping out after the next round of voting. That would free up 68 votes - almost all the 70 that Hoyle would need to win. (See 4.20am.) Of course, they won\u2019t all go to Hoyle. But it would be fair to assume that quite a few at least of the votes for Hillier and Winterton (both Labour MPs) will go to Hoyle (also a Labour MP). But Hillier and Winterton are also women, and many MPs may understandably be motivated by a desire to see another woman as Speaker, for only the second time in history. This could be Eleanor Laing\u2019s best route to victory. But is it a plausible one? Even if she were to pick up all the Hillier votes, and all the Winterton votes, and then all the Harriet Harman ones, she would still only be on 241 votes - 41 short of the 282 threshold. There are scenarios you can imagine which might see someone overhauling Hoyle. But, unlike a party leadership election, this isn\u2019t one of those ballots where people will switch to backing another candidate for personal advancement. It is a secret ballot, and even if MPs do tell the person who eventually wins they are backing their cause, there is little they will gain from the Speaker\u2019s patronage. He or she does not appoint a cabinet. And switching of this kind only normally happens in an election where voting is driven by a strong desire to block a particular candidate. But Hoyle does not inspire that sort of feelings in MPs. He is well liked, and he is easily acceptable to the house as a whole. We are not expecting to see an operation to scupper his chances. In other words, it is very hard to see how he does not end up as Speaker by the end of the day. Ken Clarke tells MPs that no candidate is dropping out. He says the new ballot papers will be printed. Labour\u2019s John Speller complains. He says there was no need to print new ballot papers. MPs could have managed with the original ones, he says. He says they would have known who had dropped out. Clarke says this is the system they are using. He suspends proceedings until the new ballot papers are printed. Ken Clarke announces the result. He says 562 MPs voted. The results are: Sir Lindsay Hoyle: 211 Dame Eleanor Laing: 113 Chris Bryant: 98 Harriet Harman: 72 Dame Rosie Winterton: 46 Sir Edward Leigh: 12 Meg Hillier: 10 Clarke says Hillier and Leigh are now out, because Hillier came last, and Leigh also received fewer than 5% of votes cast. He says any other candidate who wants to drop out must say so within the next 10 minutes. If the 562 MPs who voted stay for the rest of the day, a candidate needs 282 to get more than 50%. That means Hoyle is only 70 votes short of winning. In the Commons the division bells are ringing. That means the results of the first round of voting in the election of the new Speaker will be announced shortly. CapX\u2019s Robert Covile has picked up this gem from the BBC\u2019s coverage of the election of the new Speaker. Pro-remain independent unionist MP Lady Sylvia Hermon will hardly be punching the air with relief over Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald\u2019s endorsement of her in the forthcoming general election. (See 1.29pm.) North Down is a solidly unionist seat which is unique in being the only pro-union constituency in Northern Ireland that voted to remain in the 2016 EU referendum. However, many remain unionist voters remain solidly pro another union as well as being Europhile - the one between Northern Ireland and Britain. The most affluent parliamentary constituency in the region is also home to a large cohort of retired police officers and ex-military who admired Lady Hermon\u2019s late husband, the combative, often highly controversial former Royal Ulster Constabulary Chief Constable Jack Hermon. One veteran RUC detective whose own family were split down the middle between leave/remain in the Brexit referendum today described Sinn Fein\u2019s backing for Hermon as a potential \u201ckiss of death\u201d for the North Down MP. Whichever single unionist candidate stands against her in the campaign will use Sinn Fein\u2019s support for her throughout the weeks ahead in their bid to unseat her, he said. Whether he is right or wrong most long term observers of the Northern Irish political scene would agree that this was one endorsement Lady Hermon could have done without. In a statement outside the Houses of Parliament Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, is making a statement about the ITV proposal to exclude her from one of its election debates. ITV is holding one debate featuring just Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. Swinson says she is the only woman standing to be prime minister. She says the people excluding her could be \u201csexist\u201d, or \u201cscared\u201d, or both She says the Lib Dems are taking legal advice about what they might be able to do if ITV does not change its mind. She says the party thinks this decision is not in line with Ofcom\u2019s code. She describes the decision as a \u201cstitch-up\u201d, and says the voice of remainers is being excluded. She goes on: Why are they so scared of taking on a girly swot? I\u2019ve beefed up some of the earlier posts with direct quotes, from the Press Association wires, from the speeches given by the seven candidates for Commons Speaker. To get the updates to appear, you may need to refresh the page. The UK\u2019s national terrorism threat level has been downgraded from severe to substantial for the first time in five years, the home secretary has said, although this means a terrorist attack is still likely, my colleagues Jamie Grierson and Vikram Dodd report. My colleague Peter Walker has more from the Brexit party event. Ken Clarke thanks Harman. He says he will open the ballot. But first he has to give an explanation of the voting process. It is not clear to MPs. (That is because they are voting by secret ballot, a process only ever used in the Commons for these votes, and for select committee elections.) He says the ballot will remain open for 20 minutes. Around 45 minutes after the ballot closes, the result will be announced. He declares the ballot open. So we have to wait about an hour until we get the results of the first round of voting. Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, is the final candidate to make her pitch. She says politics is broken. MPs are facing regular threats. So this election is important. These are difficult, even dangerous times for our parliamentary democracy. The country\u2019s divided, the house is divided, the public view of this house is at an all-time low. She says, when she was leader of the Commons, she was fair to all sides. She says the Speaker\u2019s powers must be transparent. And she would be fearless in standing up for the Commons. She says her governing principle would be that all constituents are equal, and that all MPs are equal. She would do her best to ensure that all MPs can do their best. She has not been a member of a minor party in the Commons, she says. So she says she would appoint a fourth deputy speaker, from one of the smaller parties, so their perspective does not get overlooked. She says she has pushed for reform, including the introduction of proxy voting only recently. The Commons was 97% male when she was first elected, she says. She says that has changed enormously. But she says there has only been one female Speaker, Betty Boothroyd (who is watching from the gallery). So, I\u2019m running for Speaker in these difficult times because I have unparalleled experience and an unparalleled record of reform of this house, but there\u2019s one other reason I want your vote. Six hundred years, only ever one woman. There have been 156 men, and this is my question to the house today. Can we show the country we have changed by putting the second woman in that Speaker\u2019s chair? Many MPs are standing down, she says, sometimes only after a short time. That should concern people. She wishes them all well. Addressing Ken Clarke, she says he has been an exemplary parliamentarian. She wants to thank him. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the senior deputy Speaker, goes next. He is seen as the favourite, and he starts by praising Ken Clarke, but telling him that MPs expect to carry on hearing from him when he stands down. He says what matters is that MPs can use parliament to hold the government to account. As deputy Speaker, he has tried to ensure that everyone gets their voice heard. This is not a club where only people who have been here 35 years count. The person who walked through that door yesterday is just as important to their constituents - their voice must be heard as well - and the pecking order ought not to be there, it is about equality. He says the Speaker must be trusted. And they must have proven track record. He hopes people will accept that he has that. And he has shown that you can reduce the time taken for Commons matters, he says. He says security must be improved. But a lot has been done already, he says. He hopes people will credit him for what he has done to ensure that MPs are safe, their families are safe and their staff are safe. He says the chamber is under-used. There are great ideas for how it could be used more. He will not let MPs down, and he will be accountable. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the public accounts committee, is making her case now. She says she would be a Speaker who spoke less, but who, when she did speak, would be there to speak up for MPs. She would be an impartial Speaker. UQs and statements are allowed to go on for too long, she says. I would be an impartial Speaker, a director rather than an actor and we want better time keeping. She says she used to be mayor of a London borough. She had a casting vote, and had to handle some tricky situations. She says MPs know her as someone who can be discreet. I am not a grandstanding politician, I would speak little and as many of you know, I\u2019m incredibly discreet when you come to see me about matters in your constituency. And I would not seek self-publicity but speak up only for MPs and for parliament and our democracy. She says, on the restoration and renewal project, she was the MP who tabled the amendment saying MPs should move out of the building while the work goes on. She says bullying and harassment is still too rife in this building. There are good MPs to work for and bad MPs to work for. Some members of staff are afraid to raise concerns about how they are treated. She says the Commons needs better HR. This must be addressed now, she says. I\u2019d step up the approach to personal security and online bullying which is leading to too many colleagues leaving this place because it\u2019s intolerable. But the main thrust of why I\u2019m standing is the bullying and harassment that is still too rife in this building. Dame Eleanor Laing, another deputy Speaker, goes next. She thanks Ken Clarke for his service to the Commons. She says the Commons is full of good people. She is very sad that so many MPs have decided to leave. It is time someone had the courage to defend MPs, not just in his house but outside as well, she says. She says that is what she would do as Speaker. Defending members of parliament, that\u2019s what I would do if the House makes me Speaker. Because failing to stand up for the honourable men and women who come to this place to their public duty harms not only the individual MP but weakens parliament in the eyes of the nation. There is a real anxiety about the health to the democratic system, she says. She says there is a need to rebuild trust in the political system. This is a time for change, she says, and she would deliver change. There are times for continuity and there are times for change. This is the time for change. I want to be that change. This the 21st century for goodness sake, we need to escape from the overbearing and hierarchal structures that have made it all too easy for a culture of bullying to take route. She says there must be an end to bullying in the Commons. She has always discharged her duties with kindness, she says. She says the Speaker must support the welfare of MPs. And she says the Speaker should not say any more than needs to be said. And the Speaker should not be taking up the time that should be there for MPs. Can I just say that it\u2019s not the role of the Speaker to say any more than needs to be said. Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative, is speaking now. He says he would want to encourage backbenchers who are sincere in their beliefs. He says he thinks the Speaker should submerge his personality into the job. He should be a servant of the house, he says. He says Winterton and Bryant were proposing the same idea in their speeches. I think the Speaker should submerge his or her character in the job. The Speaker should be the servant of the house, the Speaker should be a dignified and quiet voice. MPs should be proud of what the Commons has achieved in the last three years, he says. Every point of view has been aired, he says. They should recreate the great debates in this place, he says. Everyone should get a fair crack of the whip, he says. I believe that we can make this place even better - I believe that it\u2019s no accident that the great speeches in history in our place were precisely that, speeches. They were not interminable self-regarding points of intervention or points of order or statements going on forever. I believe that we should recreate the great debates in this place and allow adequate time and be fair to everybody, so that everybody gets a fair crack of the whip, literally to put their point of view. He says it is also important for MPs to maintain the building properly. He says the restoration can be down cheaply and efficiently. He says he does not support the need for Richmond House to be gutted to home a replacement chamber. He urges MPs to hold the executive to account, and to be sincere in their beliefs. The Labour MP Chris Bryant goes next. He says he loves parliament. He says much good work goes on here that is not appreciated. MPs work together on campaigns that make a real difference, he says. He says he wants to restore the rulebook. It is important for the Speaker to know it backwards, he says. He says he sleeps with Erskine May at his bedside. I\u2019m standing because I love parliament, I believe in parliamentary democracy and I want to do things properly - that means being a Speaker who has absolutely no favourites, a Speaker who believes in standing by the rules, somebody who is completely impartial, who knows Erskine May inside out, back to front, I\u2019ve got it lying by my bedside. He says he wants to get PMQs back to 30 minutes. He would publish lists of speakers for debates, so that MPs know when they will be called, he says. He says he wants to stop clapping in the chamber. He ends by saying he just wants the chance to serve. Dame Rosie Winterton, a deputy speaker, goes first. She says she has been a chief whip (for Labour) and a deputy Speaker. Restoring public confidence in parliament is all our responsibility, but the Speaker sets the tone. My view is the Speaker\u2019s job is not to dominate proceedings or speak for parliament but to facilitate debate and allow parliament to speak for itself with all its different voices and all its diverse voices. She says in every job she has done she has been conciliatory. She says, as a Speaker from the north, she would show the House of Commons is open to all. And she says the last Speaker from the north (Betty Boothroyd) did a good job. As Speaker I would douse the flames not pour petrol on them. A stabilising, unifying Speaker, a Speaker from the north so the public see parliament is about the whole country and not just London. She says she does not like to see speakers at the end of debates being given just three minutes to finish speeches. She says urgent questions and PMQs should not be allowed to over-run. (That marks a contrast with John Bercow, who regularly let UQs and PMQs run until everyone down to ask a question had had a go.) She says he father was a headteacher. He was not seen as a disciplinarian. He was seen as \u201cfair, encouraging and trusted\u201d, she says. She says she would like to be the same as Speaker. She would \u201cnot seek the limelight\u201d, but build trust. In the Commons MPs have just started the debate to choose a new Speaker. Ken Clarke, the father of the Commons, is chairing proceedings. He said all seven candidates would make a five-minute speech. He said he drew lots this morning to decide the order in which they would speak. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has been speaking at at Westminster event where he is unveiling Brexit party election candidates. He says his party will not be standing aside for the Tories. John Woodcock, who was elected as Labour MP for Barrow and Furness but who left the party last year, has announced that he won\u2019t stand again for election because he and his partner, the Spectator journalist Isabel Hardman, are having a baby. He has children by his previous partner now living in Edinburgh and, as he explains in an open letter to his constituents, he thinks his new family circumstances would make continuing as an MP for a Cumbria seat impossible. Woodcock strongly criticised Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s handling of antisemitism allegations when he resigned from the Labour party, although at the time he was also facing a misconduct allegation himself. In his letter Woodcock says he had been looking forward to defending his seat as an independent. But his chances of re-election would have been minimal. Independents very rarely win in UK parliamentary elections, and in 2017 Woodcock had a majority of just 209 over the Tories. The number of deaths in Northern Ireland linked to paramilitary activity has increased year on year, a new report has found. The Independent Reporting Commission, which was set up to monitor progress on the peace process in the region, also says that Brexit could fuel further violence. \u201cThe real issue about the dangers for peace in Northern Ireland, therefore, is not that Brexit itself could be the direct cause of a renewal of violence, but rather that it has the potential to add fuel to the fire of continued paramilitarism,\u201d it said in its second annual report. It said that while the level of paramilitary violence over the last 10 years had reduced, it was \u201cdisturbing\u201d to see three paramilitary-linked deaths in the year to 20 September including the murder of journalist Lyra McKee. It found that loyalist paramilitaries were responsible for more assaults and republican paramilitaries were involved in more shootings. There are 88 organised crime groups in Northern Ireland, 22 of which have paramilitary links, it says. Jack Irvine, the veteran public relations specialist who has been taken on by the Brexit party for the election (see 12.25pm), has said he agrees with its criticisms of Boris Johnson\u2019s deal \u201c100%\u201d. In a brief email exchange following news of his appointment, Irvine said the party had hired him on a Media House contract \u201cbut I will be working seven days a week\u201d for it. Asked whether he endorsed its policies, he said: I agree with the Brexit party 100% especially on issues of sovereignty, fishing rights and regaining legal independence. I also believe that Boris has failed to deliver a genuine Brexit and am appalled at the treatment of our Northern Irish friends and relations. Plaid chose the same setting for its election campaign launch as it plumped for in 2017 \u2013 a hotel close to the Menai Bridge in north Wales. But the tone and message was very different. Two years ago the slogan was \u201cDefending Wales\u201d - against what Plaid saw as the Tories\u2019 indifference and the Labour-led Welsh government\u2019s incompetence. Plaid\u2019s ultimate goal \u2013 independence \u2013 hardly got a look-in. This time the new Plaid leader, Adam Price, who took over from Leanne Wood last year, went on the attack - and put independence front and centre. He argued that this was the time for the people of Wales to find their voice and insist that they shape their future as an independent country within the EU. Plaid\u2019s ambition for Wales to break away from the UK has been boosted by marches for independence in Wales that have attracted thousands. Its slogan this time round is: \u201cWales, it\u2019s us.\u201d Price\u2019s speech was typically passionate and colourful. At one point he seemed to be pinching a sound bite from the Star Wars movies, speaking about \u201ca new hope for all of us.\u201d He also pointed out that 11 December [1282] was the day Wales lost its independence. This year 12 December could be the start of a new push back towards independence, he claimed. The speech was full of aspiration \u2013 a green jobs revolution, better support for children who are in poverty, more affordable homes, a separate Welsh legal system. And there was also a reaching out from Plaid\u2019s leader in Westminster, Liz Saville Roberts, towards voters who tend not to back the nationalists - including English people who live in Wales. \u201cWe are the party for Wales and everyone who lives there,\u201d she said. \u201cIf Wales is in your heart we are the party for you.\u201d Sinn Fein has announced it will not stand in three constituencies in Northern Ireland in a bid to prevent DUP MPs winning the seats. The party will stand aside in South Belfast, East Belfast and North Down. As the Press Association reports, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald urged supporters to instead back the SDLP, the Alliance party and independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon respectively in those three seats. Announcing the move, McDonald said: In many ways this is a once-in-a-generation election, the stakes are very high in this election. People have a fundamental choice to make - to vote for a positive, inclusive future or to turn their backs on that and to back candidates who have been the architects of Brexit and who have acted very, very deliberately against the democratic wishes of people here in the north and more fundamentally against the economic and social interests of citizens who live here. You can call this a pact, you can call it what you wish - the reality is we are asking people to come out and vote for those pro-Remain candidates. We believe that is the right and progressive thing to do. What is novel, and striking, about today\u2019s announcement is the plan for Sinn Fein to stand aside to help Lady Sylvia Hermon. Hermon now sits as an independent, but she is a unionist, she was first elected to parliament as an Ulster Unionist party MP and she is the widow of Sir Jack Hermon, a former chief constable of the RUC. Karen Bradley, the former Northern Ireland secretary, was widely mocked last year when she admitted that, before she took on the job, she did not realise that nationalists in Northern Ireland don\u2019t vote for unionists. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand things like when elections are fought, for example, in Northern Ireland \u2013 people who are nationalists don\u2019t vote for unionist parties and vice versa,\u201d she said. She was deemed ignorant because for years in Northern Ireland the unionist/nationalist divide has trumped everything. But today\u2019s announcement from Sinn Fein shows that in some parts of Northern Ireland (but not all - see my colleague Rory Carroll at 12.30pm) these rigidities are starting to crack. Asked if she was comfortable about asking Sinn Fein supporters to back a unionist in North Down, McDonald replied: It sits very comfortably with me to ask and invite voters to thoughtfully do the right thing. And in this case it means defying hard Brexiteers, the likes of Nigel Dodds, the likes of the DUP candidates who have very, very recklessly acted against the interests of everybody. Whether you call yourself a unionist or a nationalist, a republican or a loyalist, we actually have many, many interests in common. From my colleague Jennifer Rankin The SNP is making the same claims about how a post-Brexit trade deal with the US could threaten the NHS that the Labour party is making. This is what Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister and the SNP leader, said in a statement this morning ahead of a campaign visit to Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire. Boris Johnson is desperate to do a post-Brexit trade deal with Donald Trump which will undoubtedly include prescription drug prices and corporate access to the NHS. The threat to our NHS shows why Scotland needs to escape the Westminster chaos and choose our own future. Far from getting Brexit done, if the Tories get to pass their deal, it will just be the start of the damage to our economy and public services like our precious NHS. On the visit Sturgeon also told journalists that she objected to the idea of election debates being limited to the Conservatives and Labour, as ITV is proposing for one of its debates. She said: The population, certainly in Scotland, but across the rest of the UK, is moving away from the two-party system. You\u2019ve got the broadcasters not only sticking to that but actually going back the way, because in 2010, 2015 and 2017 they had a different approach to that. My message to the broadcaster is make sure that you\u2019re reflecting politics as it is and not just how you want it to be. Loathing of Brexit united remainers and finally broke Northern Ireland\u2019s binary nationalist v unionist divide. Well, so it seemed for a few heady days. Last week Steve Aiken, the incoming leader of the Ulster Unionist party (UUP), upended convention by ruling out an electoral pact with the Democratic Unionist party (DUP). As an opponent of Brexit Aiken said he felt duty-bound to run candidates in all 18 constituencies to give pro-remain unionists an alternative to the DUP. Even in north Belfast, he said. Meaning Aiken was willing to split the unionist vote and give Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s John Finucane a better chance of taking the seat from the DUP\u2019s deputy leader, Nigel Dodds. An audacious move that prompted swift backlash. Unionists inside and outside the UUP protested. Suspected loyalist paramilitaries threatened retaliation against the UUP. At the weekend Aiken caved and said his party would skip north Belfast, giving Dodds, the DUP\u2019s Brexit policy architect, a clear run at sweeping up unionists, be they leavers or remainers. The DUP, in turn, will give the UUP a clear run in the marginal seat of Fermanagh and south Tyrone. The moderate nationalist SDLP then announced it too would stand aside in north Belfast to boost Finucane\u2019s chances. (See 12pm.) The stated reason is to let remain voters rally around a single candidate, even one who would abstain from Westminster. The other reason is to pressure Sinn F\u00e9in to stand aside in south Belfast and boost the SDLP\u2019s chance of nabbing the seat from the DUP. Unionism and nationalism, remain and leave, all simmering together in a Northern Irish stew. The Brexit party has appointed a Scottish public relations specialist and former tabloid editor, Jack Irvine, as its head of campaign communications for the general election campaign. The launch editor of the Scottish edition of the Sun in 1987, Irvine describes himself as an expert in crisis management and public affairs, telling one interviewer with the trade magazine PR Week: \u201cPeople come to me because I\u2019m combative and aggressive.\u201d Irvine set up the Glasgow-based PR firm MediaHouse in 1991, after management jobs for Mirror Group, owners of the Daily Record, and News International. Its clients in Scotland include Scottish Land &amp; Estates, the landowners group, grouse moor owners, the Bank of Scotland, the football club Rangers FC and Sir Brian Souter, the co-founder of the Stagecoach transport company during Souter\u2019s unsuccessful campaign to retain regulations which banned \u201cpromotion\u201d of gay rights in schools. His firm has expanded overseas, with Irvine campaigning in the US on an alleged fraud case involving Medicare and a medical laboratory, but he has also acted for Caribbean tax havens, including the government of the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos. Irvine has been approached for a comment on his new role. It is unclear whether he has taken the job on in a personal or professional capacity. His MediaHouse profile page reports: Irvine has carved out a niche in crisis management and public affairs and in that role deals almost exclusively with chairmen and chief executives both in Europe and the USA. The past decade has seen an increasing advisory role for Irvine with political leaders in international financial centres. And here is another question from BTL. When will we get the final result of the election for the new Speaker? My colleague Peter Walker has got an overall guide to the process here. There are now seven candidates. The election starts at 2.30pm and all the candidates will get the chance to deliver a short speech before MPs vote in a secret ballot. Commons officials says it could take up to an hour to count the papers, and so we should get the first set of results at around 4.30pm. MPs use an exhaustive ballot and, after the first round of voting, the candidate with the fewest votes drops out and MPs keep voting until someone gets more than 50% of votes cast. This means in theory there could be up to five rounds of voting. But any candidate with less than 5% of votes cast also drops out, and in practice candidates who realise they are not going to win also tend to quit voluntarily. In 2009, when MPs last elected a Speaker, there were 10 candidates but only three rounds of voting. It would be surprising if it goes beyond that this time, and so the final result should come by around 6.30pm. But it could be nearer 5.30pm if the second round of voting settles the matter. Here is Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, on Nigel Farage\u2019s decision not to stand for Westminster. Farage, of course, remains an MEP. The SDLP has announced it will not stand in three constituencies in Northern Ireland in a bid to facilitate pro-remain candidates, the Press Association reports. The nationalist party will not put forward candidates in North and East Belfast and in North Down as it attempts to prevent DUP Brexiters winning those seats. The move in North Belfast will give Sinn F\u00e9in candidate John Finucane a better chance of unseating the DUP deputy leader and longstanding MP, Nigel Dodds, who has a majority of just over 2,000. The Ulster Unionist party has already stepped aside in North Belfast to give Dodds a better chance of winning, PA reports. The UUP decision also proved controversial, as it came only a week after the incoming leader, Steve Aiken, pledged to run in all 18 constituencies in Northern Ireland. The SDLP move in East Belfast is designed to give the Alliance party leader, Naomi Long, a better chance of defeating incumbent DUP MP, Gavin Robinson, while in North Down it is hoping that independent unionist and pro-remain MP Lady Sylvia Hermon can see off a DUP challenge to unseat her, PA reports. If remainers are looking for reasons to vote Labour, Lib Dem or SNP, the Tories have got a helpful clock at CCHQ that will give them one. This is from the Tory MP Harriett Baldwin. Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader, has finished his speech at his election launch, and the Facebook live feed is over. This is what he said about the choice facing the people of Wales. In calling the third election in just four years the Westminster parties certainly have given the people the worst Christmas present ever. A political culture that is more toxic than at any time in our history, a poisoned chalice of a choice between two divided parties led by one leader who is resolutely dishonest on Brexit and another who is sadly proven, honestly, clueless. And both of them, as we\u2019ve seen in recent days, advised by public schoolboys who seem to see politics as some kind of pathological game. Price seems to be referring to the publicity for this Channel 4 Dispatches programme going out tonight. Price also said that at this election Wales should break with a century of backing Westminster parties. He said: At this election we can break with the tradition of a century of Westminster elections in Wales. Wales has overwhelmingly backed Westminster parties, Labour above all else, in all that time. But what has been the return of that investment of trust and loyalty the people of Wales have put in the Westminster parties? We are at the wrong end of every league table you care to mention, at the end of a long queue for government investment, with a worse funding settlement and fewer of the economic levers, over tax and borrowing, that have been given to Northern Ireland and Scotland. Price says Plaid Cymru is Wales\u2019s leading remain party. It wants to lead Wales to remain, and then lead it into becoming an independent member of the European Union in its own right. Price says Scotland\u2019s needs have shot to the top of the political agenda because of devolution and the strength of the SNP. The biggest legacy for Wales has been what has been cancelled: a power station, and rail electrification. He says Wales has some of the best renewable energy resources. But it does not even feature in Labour\u2019s clean energy plans. Adam Price, the leader of Plaid Cymru, is speaking at the Plaid election campaign launch now. He is speaking in a mix of English and Welsh, but there is no translation on the live feed I\u2019m using, so some of it I cannot follow. Price says an election at December is the worst Christmas ever. He says voters have a choice between someone who is dishonest, and someone who is clueless. And they are both advised by public schoolboys who see politics as a game, he says. He says the best future for Wales would be as an independent, prosperous nation. There has to be a better way, he says. He says at this election Plaid can break with a century of tradition. For the last 100 years Wales has backed the main parties. But what has Wales gained from that? It is at the wrong end of every league table that matters. Plaid Cymru is launching its general election campaign. There is a live feed here. Here is a question from a reader BTL (below the line). Could the UK leave the EU before 31 January? In theory, yes. Here is an extract from the official EU statement (pdf) agreeing the extension. If parliament were to pass the Brexit deal in time, the UK could leave the EU on 1 January. It says: The European council recalls that, under article 50(3) TEU, the withdrawal agreement may enter into force on an earlier date, should the parties complete their respective ratification procedures before the end of the period under article 50(3) TEU. Consequently, the withdrawal should take place on the first day of the month following the completion of the ratification procedures or on 1 February 2020, whichever is the earliest. In an interview with the Sun on Sunday, Boris Johnson suggested that, in the event of the Tories winning the election, Brexit could happen by Christmas. The story started: Boris Johnson has revealed his \u201cfast and furious\u201d plan to get Brexit wrapped up by Christmas if he wins a decisive general election victory on December 12. But the actual quote from Johnson was a bit less specific. He told the paper: We\u2019ve got a deal that\u2019s ready to go and if we can get it right with a new parliament we will move quickly. Our new MPs will come back the following day and we will bang it through. We\u2019ll get Brexit done very, very fast and avoid another infinite period of dither and delay. And, in practice, Johnson\u2019s \u201cBrexit by Christmas\u201d pledge will probably turn out to be as reliable as his \u201cdo or die\u201d one to deliver Brexit by 31 October because it is very hard to imagine the Brexit agreement being passed before Christmas. MPs will not be able to return to the Commons \u201cthe following day\u201d after the election because the counting will not finish in some constituencies until late Friday. Then, when MPs do return to the Commons at the start of a new parliament, it normally takes a few days for them all to take the oath before any legislating can actually start. And even if Johnson were able to ram the withdrawal agreement bill through parliament before Christmas, the European parliament would also have to vote to rubber-stamp it for the UK to be able to leave on 1 January. UPDATE: Sorry. I got sidetracked, and overlooked the point about a no-deal Brexit. No deal is now off the table until 31 January. The extension agreement means that, under international law, the UK is now a member of the EU until the end of January, unless a deal is agreed by the end of December, and UK law has also been amended to reflect this. And here is Jennifer\u2019s full story about Jean-Claude Juncker criticising Boris Johnson for telling \u201cso many lies\u201d during the 2016 referendum campaign. Jean-Claude Juncker, the outgoing president of the European commission, has said in an interview that Boris Johnson lied during the 2106 referendum campaign, my colleague Jennifer Rankin reports. If you are looking for evidence of lies and untruths told during the 2016 referendum, the Labour MP Richard Corbett has a good list on his website here. (The remain campaign was generally more honest, but it wasn\u2019t perfect, and the claim that a vote to leave would trigger the need for an emergency, tax-raising budget was particularly spurious.) In a phone-in with LBC this morning Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons and leading Brexiter, said that Nigel Farage should \u201cretire from the field\u201d because he had already achieved his lifelong ambition to deliver Brexit. Rees-Mogg claimed that, by standing against the Tories at the election, the Brexit party could end up snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Rees-Mogg said: I think [Farage] would be well-advised to recognise that that battle he won. He should be really proud of his political career. It would be a great shame if he carries on fighting after he has already won to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. I understand why Nigel Farage would want to carry on campaigning because he has been campaigning for the best part of 30 years and it must be hard to retire from the field. But that is what he ought to do. In an interview with ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, played down suggestions that by standing candidates all over Britain, his party would damage the Tories more than Labour. He said his party would \u201churt the Labour party in the most extraordinary way\u201d. He said: I led Ukip into the 2015 general election. I had all the same stuff, all the same arguments. The Tory tribe screaming and shouting, \u2018Don\u2019t take our votes\u2019. The Ukip vote took more votes from Labour than it did from the Conservatives, [David] Cameron wouldn\u2019t have even got a majority without Ukip. We are going to hurt the Labour party in the most extraordinary way. We\u2019ll do it in South Wales, we\u2019ll do it in the Midlands, we\u2019ll do it in the north of England. Those Labour voters have been completely betrayed by the Labour party. They are my number one target. I got those votes in 2015, I\u2019ll do it again. Farage\u2019s analysis is not generally shared by election experts, who have been arguing that it is the Conservatives who will lose out most from having Brexit party candidates on the ballot. In his interview Farage also defended his decision not to stand as a candidate himself. As my colleagues Simon Murphy and Liz Perkins report here, Francesca O\u2019Brien is being urged to stand down as the Conservative candidate in Gower after it emerged that five years ago she wrote a post on Facebook saying people on the reality TV show Benefits Street needed \u201cputting down\u201d. Gower, a Labour-held marginal, is one of the Tories\u2019 key targets in Wales. In her Today interview Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, refused to back calls for O\u2019Brien to be removed as a candidate. Coffey said that O\u2019Brien\u2019s comment was \u201cclearly wrong\u201d, but that she had apologised and that it should be up to the people of the Gower to decide if they wanted her as an MP. Ian Lavery, the Labour party chair, said Coffey should have disowned her candidate. In a statement he said: Removing a candidate who used such vile language about people on benefits should be a no brainer. The cuts to benefits and universal credit programme that Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey and her party are responsible for have forced people into poverty. It is shameful that Boris Johnson is allowing Francesca O\u2019Brien to stand for his party in Gower. This reveals the Conservatives\u2019 contempt for the less well off. Brexit is at risk because of Nigel Farage\u2019s decision to put up Brexit party candidates against the Tories, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, told the Today programme this morning. She said: The Conservative party is the party that will get Brexit done. I cannot understand how Nigel Farage puts at risk ... being the person who lets Brexit evaporate. Only the Conservative party, in this election, of the parties that have the chance of being in government, are the only party that is going to respect the referendum of 2016. The election campaign has only just started but already senior figures in the health service are expressing alarm at the way that the NHS is being used as a \u201cpolitical weapon\u201d in the campaign. The NHS is always a key election issue, of course, but there are at least two reasons why it is set to be more salient than usual this year. First, we are having an unusual December election, which means hospitals are under more pressure than they are when people normally go to the polls in the spring. And, second, this is an election where both main parties think they can win on health. Normally the Tories cede this issue to Labour, but Boris Johnson has decided to put the NHS at the top of his agenda (he believes that the Vote Leave bus slogan means he is obliged to champion health spending) and some polling shows that he is trusted more on health than Jeremy Corbyn, which is an unusual feat for a Tory leader. In an article in the Times (paywall) Carrie MacEwen, chairwoman of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, says that any public debate about the NHS needs to be based on \u201crealistic expectations\u201d and that the general election makes this unlikely. She says: We have already had a taste of what may be ahead. Labour has claimed that a nationalised drugs company would \u201cmake medicines cheaper\u201d. But who is going to fund the research for new drugs? The Conservatives claimed \u201cfunding for 40 new hospitals\u201d, making it disappointing to learn that in fact money had been allocated to just six. This is easy electioneering aimed at a soft target. Undeliverable promises simply set the NHS up to fail. And this is at a time when it is actually on a long-overdue path to success. And in an article for the Times\u2019 Red Box website (paywall) Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals and other health trust organisations, makes a similar point. He says having the NHS as a dominant election issue could be counterproductive. He explains: This political potency is often helpful for the NHS. But it becomes counter-productive when the NHS is used as a political weapon. Frontline NHS leaders are worried that is already starting to happen in this election. Of course we need to be open and honest about where the health service is falling short. It is clear that, despite treating many more patients than ever before, the NHS is falling back against key targets for A and E, cancer care and diagnostic tests. Waiting lists for operations have climbed to nearly four and a half million and the pressures on our mental health, community and ambulance services are just as great. However hard the NHS frontline works, it can\u2019t seem to keep up with growing demand. This is particularly worrying with winter looming. But as pressures on the NHS intensify in the coming weeks, over-dramatising or distorting the difficulties for political ends will do nothing to help those frontline staff who are working flat out for patients. Equally, disingenuous claims about extra funding, or promises that create unrealistic expectations, may be tempting in the heat of the election battle, but they do the health service no favours. These are understandable arguments, but there seems to be little chance of their having much impact on the campaign. Rightly or wrongly, electioneering is always drawn towards hyperbole. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, meet NHS staff at Unison HQ in London. 10.30am: Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader, and Liz Saville Roberts, its leader at Westminster, launch Plaid\u2019s election campaign. 2pm: Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, unveils the party\u2019s 600 election candidates. 2.30pm: MPs start the process of electing a new Speaker. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on general election developments and on the election of a new Speaker. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",
