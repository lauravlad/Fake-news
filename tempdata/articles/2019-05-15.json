I hope the same will be true of many of my fellow candidates from across the political spectrum.\u201d Denyer explained: \u201cThe dangerous creep of the far right into mainstream politics is enabled by well-meaning people offering them platforms out of a sense of fairness. But while the protection of free speech is important, we have to guard against the far right taking advantage of it.\u201d After the event was cancelled, Denyer said the better option would have been to ban Benjamin. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed UWE Bristol cancelled the event rather than simply remove Benjamin,\u201d she said. A fellow Green EU election candidate, Cleo Lake, said: \u201cIt is wholly unacceptable that Carl Benjamin be given a platform, especially in a diverse and inclusive city like Bristol. Creating fear of social unrest is a key tactic of the far right and we should not play into it.\u201d The Greens\u2019 stance was criticised by the Tory MEP Ashley Fox. He said Benjamin\u2019s comments were disgusting but added: \u201cIn a democracy we counter bad ideas with good ones \u2013 not stopping debate.\u201d Protests had been inevitable. The group Bristol Antifascists had called for people to meet at the Frenchay campus car park to demonstrate against Benjamin. In a statement, UWE Bristol said: \u201cAs a university, we are wholly committed to the principle of freedom of speech and we have a long history of regularly welcoming a diversity of speakers on to our campuses to spark discussion and debate with our students, staff and visitors. \u201cHowever, we also have a duty of care to everyone on our campus and to ensure that they are secure and safe.\u201d The statement said both Avon and Somerset police and the university security team considered the event to be too high risk to hold on campus as it required significant security measures. Avon and Somerset police said the decision to cancel was one for the university and students\u2019 union to make. Freddie Gough, a spokesman for the students\u2019 union, said: \u201cWe will continue to support our societies to exercise their right to freedom of speech and remain committed to enabling students to organise a range of events that promote debate.\u201d",

It is highly unusual for the opposition to abstain on such a major piece of legislation, and if Labour were to adopt this approach (which is nothing more than an option at the moment, based on this afternoon\u2019s briefing), anti-Brexit members would be alarmed. But an abstention would lead to the bill getting a second reading, with the key vote effectively postponed until MPs voted on the amended bill at third reading. Labour\u2019s move came as ministers argued that, if MPs were to vote down the bill, the UK would face a choice between no-deal and no Brexit.

You can argue about how much this is due to Corbyn personally - even that bastion of neoliberalism, the IMF, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/26/imf-inequality-economic-growth\">warning about inequality in 2014</a>, long before Corbyn became Labour leader - but the announcement this week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2019/may/14/britain-risks-heading-to-us-levels-of-inequality-warns-top-economist\">the Institute for Fiscal Studies has launched a major review of the consequences of inequality </a>is a clear vindication of one of core political themes. The IFS has always been much more associated with fiscal rectitude than social justice, and if even it recognises there is a problem, Corbyn is winning the argument. A sensible prime minister would recognise this, and engage. But instead May just refused to accept that there is anything wrong. It was an unconvincing performance that saw her easily outmatched by Corbyn.</p> <p>But it was still all a bit underwhelming - largely because, with May effectively now at the point where she is working out her notice, who cares what she has to say anyway? This became painfully apparent when she had to respond to a question about the next spending round - which is one that will be overseen by her successor. In her exchanges with Corbyn, and the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford, it felt that May was not even trying particularly hard. But PMQs did throw up two policies issues where the debate over the coming months is likely to intensify. Corbyn proudly defended <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48234398\">Labour\u2019s plan to extend its real living wage to under-18s.</a> There is a genuine debate to be had about whether this can be done without increasing youth unemployment, but the arguments did not really get much of a hearing today. Interestingly, May herself chose to raise another Labour proposal - its qualified support for universal basic income. But, again, the rights and wrongs of this were not thrashed out in today\u2019s debate. That will have to wait for another day.</p> <p>Corbyn used to make a point of using the \u201cletter from an ordinary voter\u201d device to frame an awkward question for the PM. Today it was the Tory Brexiter Peter Bone who tried this. It allowed him to tell May she should resign, but in a manner that discouraged a blunt response (because the activists who supposedly drafted this letter would deserve a polite reply). But Bone just got the usual May brush-off. Even calls for May\u2019s resignation can\u2019t really enliven PMQs very much now.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-05-15T15:05:26.609Z\">at 4.05pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5cdbfbbe8f08ea3978d87048\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-15T11:47:12.791Z\">12.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Stephen Kerr,</strong> a Conservative, says Scottish Tories see May as a trenchant champion of the union.

Or does the extension preclude this? </p> <p>Not that I think this should happen, nor that \"internal UK parliament stuff\" actually could happen. Just wondering if EU countries are protected from British insanity.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>The EU and the UK have agreed to postpone Brexit until 31 October, unless the UK passes the withdrawal agreement before than, which would allow an earlier exit.</p> <p>A British prime minister can unilaterally revoke article 50. But there is no mechanism that would allow a new PM to unilaterally change the 31 October date and trigger an immediate no-deal.</p> <p>That said, a new PM could try to speed the process up by adopting a policy of non-cooperation with the EU (for example, by withholding monthly payments). Or the government could try to bring forward the date of Brexit in the EU Withdrawal Act, meaning EU law would no longer apply.</p> <p>But these would be seen as extremely hostile and reckless measures, which would be opposed by parliament and would could cause severe damage to long-term relations with Brussels. Unless Nigel Farage were to become PM before October they are not plausible scenarios, and even he would probably have second thoughts.</p> <p>However, a new PM could insist on a no-deal Brexit on 31 October even if the EU27 all wanted a further extension. That is because article 50 can only be extended again with UK agreement.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-05-15T10:53:33.371Z\">at 11.53am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5cdbeb218f08ea3978d86f31\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-15T10:39:16.671Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Turning away from Stephen Barclay for a moment, <strong>Penny Mordaunt</strong>, the new defence secretary, seems to have made a good impression with the speech she gave this morning.</p> <p>These are from the BBC\u2019s defence correspondent <strong>Jonathan Beale.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bealejonathan/status/1128591292806651904\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New DefSec <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PennyMordaunt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@PennyMordaunt</a> makes strong case for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RoyalNavy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RoyalNavy</a> 2 new carriers to deliver \u201cglobal Britain\u201d ambitions \u201ca mighty symbol of our intent\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RUSI_org?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RUSI_org</a></p>&mdash; Jonathan Beale (@bealejonathan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bealejonathan/status/1128591292806651904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 15, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bealejonathan/status/1128593564135563264\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Days of taking decades to deliver new warships fo Navy are over says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PennyMordaunt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@PennyMordaunt</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RUSI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#RUSI</a></p>&mdash; Jonathan Beale (@bealejonathan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bealejonathan/status/1128593564135563264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 15, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bealejonathan/status/1128596466434551808\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">DefSec @PennyMorduant says measures to protect British soldiers facing investigations should cover  N Ireland veterans</p>&mdash; Jonathan Beale (@bealejonathan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bealejonathan/status/1128596466434551808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 15, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bealejonathan/status/1128597781202051072\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Defsec <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PennyMordaunt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@PennyMordaunt</a> says \u201cI\u2019m not going to be shy about asking for more money\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RUSI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#RUSI</a></p>&mdash; Jonathan Beale (@bealejonathan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bealejonathan/status/1128597781202051072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 15, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bealejonathan/status/1128598081010843648\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Confident and assured first public speech as DefSec by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PennyMordaunt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@PennyMordaunt</a> at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RUSI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#RUSI</a></p>&mdash; Jonathan Beale (@bealejonathan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bealejonathan/status/1128598081010843648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 15, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And this is from my colleague <strong>John Crace,</strong> the Guardian\u2019s sketchwriter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JohnJCrace/status/1128607131580628993\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Penny Morduant in her first speech as defence secretary seemed to think you can build a frigate for \u00a3250m.

For example, what if a Boris Johnson-type figure became prime minister in October, and he or she was determined to leave without a deal? That person would refuse to ask for an extension and Parliament would not have time to bring down the government and prevent no deal before October 31st (to which the counter-argument is that no prime minister committed to a no deal Brexit could ever win a parliamentary majority for forming a government in the first place).</p> <p>Some senior figures in Brussels expect the British to receive an extension till June 2020. That is the latest possible date for the EU to agree on its next seven-year budget plan, the multiannual financial framework that starts in 2021, without serious problems arising. In the long run the UK would have to go for an election or referendum or no deal \u2013 or possibly a different kind of Brexit, said one figure. But would not Macron veto further extensions? \u201cNo, he could not resist the pressure from all the others in the room to compromise.\u201d</p> <p>Another official agrees that the 27 are unlikely to force the UK out by refusing a further extension, but adds that this could change if the British elected a fearsome swarm of Faragist MPs in the European elections. Similarly, a new government led by a hard-line eurosceptic committed to starting fights with the EU could lead the patience of some member-states to snap.</p> </blockquote> <p>My colleague <strong>Jennifer Rankin </strong>in Brussels also thinks a further article 50 extension is more likely than not.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferMerode/status/1128565045837930496\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Will the EU refuse a Brexit extension next time?

      "bodyText": "Downing Street has hinted that the Commons vote on the withdrawal agreement bill will be make or break for Theresa May\u2019s future as prime minister, as ministers have warned that, if she loses, the UK will face a choice between no-deal and no Brexit. (See 3.20pm.) Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has urged the home secretary to introduce flexible immigration rules for skilled workers after Brexit to avoid vacancies in certain industries. As the Press Association reports, Gove claims to have called on Sajid Javid to \u201clook flexibly in how we interpret what a skilled worker is,\u201d and criticised the \u00a330,000 salary threshold for immigrant workers. Giving evidence to Holyrood\u2019s rural economy committee, Gove said that assessing whether a migrant worker qualified as skilled by their salary was not appropriate for all industries. Questioned about \u201csignificant vacancies\u201d of approximately 30% in the fish processing sector in Scotland by the SNP\u2019s Stewart Stevenson, Gove argued that the migration advisory committee\u2019s recommendation of the minimum earnings for a worker to be allowed to stay after Brexit would harm businesses who rely on foreign labour. Gove said: Pitching the level at which you define a skilled worker as someone earning over \u00a330,000 a year wasn\u2019t actually responsive to the particular needs - not just of the fish processing sector - but the food and drink sector overall. One of the points that I have made to the home secretary and others is that we look flexibly at how we interpret what a skilled worker is in line with specific industries. Four members of the Welsh assembly - three Ukip AMs and Mark Reckless, who left Ukip in 2017 to join the Conservative group - have defected to the Brexit party. They have asked to be recognised as an official Brexit party group in the assembly. (See 3.29pm.) The consumers organisation Which? has criticised Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, for saying chlorinated chicken is not a food safety issue. (See 11.17am.) In a statement Caroline Normand, the Which? director of advocacy, said: Liam Fox is wrong to suggest chlorinated chicken is not a food safety and standards issue. One of the reasons why food-borne disease rates are so much higher in the US is that these measures are often used as a desperate attempt to make up for widespread safety problems in food production - leaving bacteria like salmonella to run rampant. Our research has shown British consumers are united in their opposition to lowering food standards as part of any future trade deal - with nearly seven in 10 saying they would be uncomfortable eating chlorine-washed chicken. Brexit is an opportunity to design a joined up food and farming policy that ensures food is produced to the highest standards - the nation\u2019s health needs must not be used as a bargaining chip that could be given away to facilitate transatlantic trade. Labour\u2019s plan to nationalise Britain\u2019s energy network would make the country poorer, hinder efforts to tackle climate change, and threatens a return to the frequent power cuts of the past, the UK\u2019s leading business lobby group has warned. Parliament is to receive an overhaul of its publicly displayed art work, with dozens of former and current female politicians and campaigners to be introduced to the walls of the Palace of Westminster. The government does not know how many British users may have been affected by a \u201cterrifying\u201d WhatsApp security breach, MPs have been told. As the Press Association reports, shadow culture secretary Tom Watson warned a security flaw in the messaging app could be used by states to monitor human rights groups. The digital minister, Margot James, said the likelihood of there being UK victims of the attack is being investigated but said, as yet, there is no information about how many people could have been targeted. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. This is from Anne Milton, the skills minister. Good job it\u2019s not national literacy day ... Theresa May is now in Paris for an event with world leaders who are agreeing a plan to eliminate terrorist and violent content online. It is called the Christchurch Call because New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has worked up the plan in response to the Christchurch mosque attacks in March. Here is some new polling on the European elections from Survation. The House of Commons library often produces the best briefings on election results, and it has now published its document (pdf) on the English local elections. If you want a very detailed account, this is what you need. Here\u2019s a chart from the report. The government\u2019s claim that a vote against the withdrawal agreement in June will leave the UK with a choice between no-deal and no Brexit depends on the assumption that the EU will not agree to another article 50 extension. As explained at 9.52am, that assumption is not well founded. And now it has emerged that Jacek Czaputowicz, Poland\u2019s foreign minister, has said publicly that the EU should be willing to grant another extension to allow time for the UK to change its mind about Brexit. As Reuters reports, in comments released late last night, Czaputowicz said: From Poland\u2019s point of view, it would be good if Brexit would not happen. It\u2019s a matter of changing the rhetoric to let the Brits rethink their decision. We should go soft on Britain, give them time, they are still in the EU, let\u2019s give them space to take decision. Change UK MPs are criticising Labour after Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman refused to rule out the party abstaining on the EU withdrawal agreement bill at a briefing. This is from Chuka Umunna. And this is from Chris Leslie. Four Welsh assembly members are seeking to band together to form a Brexit party group. The four include Mark Reckless, who has been a Tory MP and a Ukip and Tory AM. He has resigned from the Tory group. The three others, Mandy Jones, Caroline Jones and David Rowlands, have all been Ukip AMs. They have written to the Llywydd - the assembly\u2019s equivalent of a speaker \u2013 notifying her of their wish to form a political group. Mark Reckless told a press conference on the Senedd steps: Brexit is being blocked and the Brexit party group in the Welsh assembly from today will be supporting Nigel Farage, supporting the Brexit party in everything that they are doing to protect our democracy and to ensure that Brexit is delivered. Other parties are not happy. A Plaid Cymru spokesperson said: We consider this announcement today as having very serious implications for our democracy and our democratic principles here in the Senedd. The Brexit party did not stand and were not elected in the 2016 elections. They have no democratic mandate and they should not be permitted to form a group nor given access to public resources and funding in the Senedd. To permit them to form a group would make a mockery of our democratic system in Wales. The Senedd is not a playground for Brexiteer chancers, it is the home of Welsh democracy. We eagerly anticipate the Llywydd\u2019s ruling in the full expectation that she will do the right thing and allow democracy to prevail. This is what Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, told the Lords EU committee earlier about how a defeat for the EU withdrawal agreement bill at second reading would leave the UK a choice between a no-deal Brexit and no Brexit. He said: I think if the House of Commons does not approve the WAB then the Barnier deal is dead in that form and I think the house will have to then address a much more fundamental question between whether it will pursue ... a no-deal option or whether it will revoke. This is what Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, was also saying this morning (see 11.17am), as well as Downing Street. (See 9.52am.) Labour sources are playing down suggestions the party might abstain on the EU withdrawal agreement bill, PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield reports. HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh thinks that in the end Labour won\u2019t abstain on the second reading of the EU withdrawal agreement bill. Theresa May has been offered a possible lifeline ahead of a key vote on her Brexit deal next month after Labour refused to rule out abstaining. The government has announced that MPs will vote on the second reading of the EU withdrawal agreement bill in the first week in June, in what will effectively be the fourth vote on May\u2019s withdrawal agreement. If the government were to lose, that would be fatal to May\u2019s Brexit strategy, and her premiership, and there is no evidence she is winning over the MPs who voted against it last time. (See 9.25am.) But Labour has refused to rule out abstaining in the second reading vote. It is highly unusual for the opposition to abstain on such a major piece of legislation, and if Labour were to adopt this approach (which is nothing more than an option at the moment, based on this afternoon\u2019s briefing), anti-Brexit members would be alarmed. But an abstention would lead to the bill getting a second reading, with the key vote effectively postponed until MPs voted on the amended bill at third reading. Labour\u2019s move came as ministers argued that, if MPs were to vote down the bill, the UK would face a choice between no-deal and no Brexit. (See 11.17am.) The lead candidate for Change UK in Scotland\u2019s European parliament contest has switched sides to the Liberal Democrats, in further signs the new party is struggling to consolidate itself or spread successfully across the UK. (See 10.36am.) Jeremy Corbyn has used PMQs to attack the \u201cscandal of inequality in modern Britain\u201d. He said: In Great Yarmouth, one has just been opened for pupils at a school, and last week the department of business established a food bank for its own staff in the building on Victoria Street. Can the prime minister tell us what is going wrong in modern Britain that a government office in the centre of London has a food bank for some of its very low-paid staff to get something to eat? In response, May argued that inequality was also a problem under Labour and that income inequality had fallen since 2010. Lone parents and their children have lost challenges against the government\u2019s benefit cap at the UK\u2019s highest court. Penny Mordaunt, the new defence secretary, has said she would like a planned new law offering an amnesty on historical prosecutions for military veterans who served in Iraq, Afghanistan and anywhere else around the world to also cover Northern Ireland. The government has been criticised for rejecting a proposed working definition of Islamophobia that has been adopted by parties including Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Conservatives. Jeremy Corbyn will outline plans to nationalise Britain\u2019s energy network in a move that would transfer companies to public ownership soon after a Labour election win. A catalogue of errors by the Home Office has led to a loss of access to \u00a3600,000 of EU funds earmarked for the most deprived people in Britain and has put a further \u00a32.9m at risk, it can be revealed. Here is more on Labour refusing to rule out abstaining on the second reading of the EU withdrawal agreement bill. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves This is from my colleague Jessica Elgot. And these are from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn. These are from my colleague Heather Stewart. PMQs - Snap verdict: Yesterday, in response to Bridget Prentice\u2019s resignation from the party, Labour issued a statement saying its \u201cbold and popular policies under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership have changed the political conversation in this country\u201d and today he focused on a topic, inequality, where undoubtedly opinion is moving his way. You can argue about how much this is due to Corbyn personally - even that bastion of neoliberalism, the IMF, was warning about inequality in 2014, long before Corbyn became Labour leader - but the announcement this week that the Institute for Fiscal Studies has launched a major review of the consequences of inequality is a clear vindication of one of core political themes. The IFS has always been much more associated with fiscal rectitude than social justice, and if even it recognises there is a problem, Corbyn is winning the argument. A sensible prime minister would recognise this, and engage. But instead May just refused to accept that there is anything wrong. It was an unconvincing performance that saw her easily outmatched by Corbyn. But it was still all a bit underwhelming - largely because, with May effectively now at the point where she is working out her notice, who cares what she has to say anyway? This became painfully apparent when she had to respond to a question about the next spending round - which is one that will be overseen by her successor. In her exchanges with Corbyn, and the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford, it felt that May was not even trying particularly hard. But PMQs did throw up two policies issues where the debate over the coming months is likely to intensify. Corbyn proudly defended Labour\u2019s plan to extend its real living wage to under-18s. There is a genuine debate to be had about whether this can be done without increasing youth unemployment, but the arguments did not really get much of a hearing today. Interestingly, May herself chose to raise another Labour proposal - its qualified support for universal basic income. But, again, the rights and wrongs of this were not thrashed out in today\u2019s debate. That will have to wait for another day. Corbyn used to make a point of using the \u201cletter from an ordinary voter\u201d device to frame an awkward question for the PM. Today it was the Tory Brexiter Peter Bone who tried this. It allowed him to tell May she should resign, but in a manner that discouraged a blunt response (because the activists who supposedly drafted this letter would deserve a polite reply). But Bone just got the usual May brush-off. Even calls for May\u2019s resignation can\u2019t really enliven PMQs very much now. Stephen Kerr, a Conservative, says Scottish Tories see May as a trenchant champion of the union. Does May agree the shared prosperity fund will provide an opportunity to strengthen the union? Will it be led by needs, and not Barnettised? May says the fund will strengthen the union, and it will be led be needs. And that\u2019s it. PMQs is over. Peter Bone, a Conservative, says he has got an incredible group of activists in his constituency who have campaigned regularly for the party. But he has a letter from them. They do not like her Brexit deal. And they have lost confidence in May. They want her to resign before the European elections. What message does May have for them? May praises all Conservatives who campaign. She thanks them for their work. This is a government that wants to deliver Brexit, she says. If MPs had voted for it, the UK would already be out, she says. Labour\u2019s Albert Owen says a constituent died after being shot with a crossbow outside his house. Will the law on crossbows be reviewed? May says this is a very worrying story. Labour\u2019s Louise Haigh asks about a BBC report saying four children have been killed after family courts ordered that abusive parents should have access to them. Will she order a public inquiry? May says new guidance on this was issued to courts last week. The Ministry of Justice has not seen evidence to justify an inquiry, she says, but she says justice minister will meet Haigh to discuss this. Neil O\u2019Brien, a Conservative, asks about access to a particular drug on the NHS. May says she is pleased the NHS and Nice have reached an agreement to make it available. Labour\u2019s Caroline Flint asks May to welcome a ruling condeming the blacklisting of trade unionists. And does she agree that trade unions play an important role? May says unions do have an important role to play. The government wants to see workers rights improved, she says. Antoinette Sandbach, a Conservative, is asking a question about bereaved parents. But she is interrupted by an announcement from a speaker broadcasting into the chamber saying a fire alarm test has been completed. May says this is a worrying time for British Steel workers. The government struck a deal with the company last month to help it meet its obligations under EU emissions laws. Labour\u2019s Thangam Debbonaire says the PM says it is her deal, no-deal or no exit. But MPs have voted against her deal and no-deal. So will she admit it is no Brexit or a second referendum. May says MPs should vote to implement Brexit. Labour\u2019s Barry Sheerman says he was a passionate Eurosceptic when he became an MP 40 years ago. But he changed his mind when he saw what the EU did for peace and prosperity. Will May tell the truth about Europe, instead of echoing the lies told by Ukip? May says people voted to leave the EU. The government should implement that, she says. Vicky Ford, a Conservative, asks May if she backs the idea of a fund to help universities improve the way they look after students with mental health problems. May says she will ask the health and education secretaries to look at this. Rosie Duffield, a Labour MP, asks if May agrees with Labour about the need to scrap tests for pre-teenage children because they generate stress. May says simple tests that allow judgments to be made about how much children have progressed are useful and should continue. Rebecca Pow, a Conservative, asks May if she agrees Somerset schools need more funding. May says the strong economy allows the government to put more money into schools. The SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart says the Tory backenches look a bit threadbare. The UK is looking a laughing stock. For the sake of the nation, will May go, and let Scotland to too. May says, judging by Wishart\u2019s question, his charm offensive to become next speaker has started. Labour\u2019s Bill Esterson says the government says it wants to tackle climate change. But the reality suggests otherwise. It is investing in fossil fuel projects abroad while denying funding to green energy initiatives. May says the government is investing in the future. She says 99% of solar energy deployed in the UK has been under a Conservative government. Nigel Evans, a Tory Brexiter, asks May to confirm that if the UK stays in the customs union and the single market, it will not have left the EU. May says the UK will end free movement, take control of UK law and end the era of vast payments to the EU. And the UK will not pay for market access, she says. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, says the three-times-defeated Brexit deal will return in June. Has May done a backroom deal with Labour to sell out Scotland. May says it is only the SNP that wants to sell out Scotland. Blackford says the Scottish people do not know what is happening in these secret talks. At the European elections the people of Scotland will make their feelings heard, he says. May says if the SNP vote for the deal, the UK will leave the EU. If people want a party that is not only a Brexit party, but one that can deliver it, they should vote Conservative. Nigel Huddleston, a Conservative, asks if education will get more money in the next spending round. May says the government is committed to improving education for every child. Corbyn says his question was about food banks in a government office. That suggests in-work poverty is the problem, he says. He says the Trussell Trust handed out 1.6m food parcels last year, and 500,000 of them went to children. Will the government restore the link between inflation and welfare payments? May says this government introduced the national living wage. The low paid are taking home a lot more as a result. Corbyn says the IFS says child poverty will rise to over 5m by 2022 because of the government\u2019s policies. The wealth of the richest has inceased by \u00a350bn. But if we do not have enough money to feed people, we have failed as a society. More people are in poverty. When will the government reverse tax giveaways to the rich and end the scandal of inequality in Britain. May says the top 1% are paying more in income tax than they ever did under Labour. Labour is proposing a welfare payment for everyone. That would mean money for the rich paid for by the poor. Corbyn asks how it can be fair for executives to be paid so much more than their workers. Young people suffer in particular, which is why Labour will stop young people being paid a lower minimum wage than older people. Does May agree this is right? May says the Labour policy will cost job. Youth unemployment has fallen by 50%, she says. Corbyn says the Tories opposed the minimum wage. They said it would cost jobs. Why do the Tories continue to punish young people? Wages are lower than a decade ago, housing costs are soared, and more and more food banks are opening. In Great Yarmouth one has been opened for pupils. And the business department has opened one for its staff, he says. May says work is the best way to ensure people have a good standard of living. She says Corbyn has not acknowledged that unemployment is at a record law. She says Corbyn implies inequality started in 2010. But who said the last Labour government ensured inequality got worse. Who was it? Corbyn himself, she says. Corbyn asks about Angus Deaton, the Nobel prize winning economist investigating inequality for the IFS. He says the UK has the second worst record on inequality in the G7. May says wages are going up. Jeremy Corbyn pays tribute to Brian Walden, the former Labour MP and interviewer. He was a formidable interviewer, he says. Every MP has said that - but only afterwards. He also pays tribute to Doris Day, a Hollywood icon and animal rights campaign. He says he is tempted to quote one of her songs - whip crackaway. He says nine hedge fund tycoons have donated millions to the Conservative party. Is this a government for the many or for the few. May also pays tribute to Doris Day. She gave many hours of entertainment, she says. After Corbyn paid tribute to two Labour MPs elected 40 years ago, May says Margaret Thatcher was elected 40 years ago. On inequality, May says income inequality is down since 2010. The Conservatives want everyone to have a better life. Labour wants to bring people down. The Tories want to bring them up. Mark Pawsey, a Conservative, asks about a young carer in his constituency. May says the government has published a cross-government carers\u2019 action plan which is intended to help young carers. The SNP\u2019s Alan Brown asks about transplant case that went wrong. May says she will ensure the relevant minister looks at the case. Theresa May starts by saying she will be going to Paris later for an international summit about stopping terrorists from exploiting the internet. From BrexitCentral\u2019s Jonathan Isaby From the Daily Record\u2019s Torcuil Crichton This is from PA\u2019s Richard Wheeler. PMQs is starting soon. I will post my snap verdict after the whole session is over. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Here is a question from below the line worth addressing. The EU and the UK have agreed to postpone Brexit until 31 October, unless the UK passes the withdrawal agreement before than, which would allow an earlier exit. A British prime minister can unilaterally revoke article 50. But there is no mechanism that would allow a new PM to unilaterally change the 31 October date and trigger an immediate no-deal. That said, a new PM could try to speed the process up by adopting a policy of non-cooperation with the EU (for example, by withholding monthly payments). Or the government could try to bring forward the date of Brexit in the EU Withdrawal Act, meaning EU law would no longer apply. But these would be seen as extremely hostile and reckless measures, which would be opposed by parliament and would could cause severe damage to long-term relations with Brussels. Unless Nigel Farage were to become PM before October they are not plausible scenarios, and even he would probably have second thoughts. However, a new PM could insist on a no-deal Brexit on 31 October even if the EU27 all wanted a further extension. That is because article 50 can only be extended again with UK agreement. Turning away from Stephen Barclay for a moment, Penny Mordaunt, the new defence secretary, seems to have made a good impression with the speech she gave this morning. These are from the BBC\u2019s defence correspondent Jonathan Beale. And this is from my colleague John Crace, the Guardian\u2019s sketchwriter. Q: Can you tell us more about the cross-party talks with Labour? Barclay says they have focused on the Labour demands set out in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s five points. Q: Does the government accept that the MEPs elected next week will have to take their seats? Yes, says Barclay. He says the government wanted to avoid this. Barclay says British MEPs elected next week will take their seats. This means the government has given up hope of trying to pass the Brexit legislation before 2 July, when the new European parliament meets for the first time. Barclay says, if MPs do not vote for the deal next month, it will be dead. Then MPs will face a choice between a no-deal Brexit and revoking article 50. This is the argument we have also heard from Liam Fox this morning (see 11.17am) and from Number 10. UPDATE: Here is the clip. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has just started giving evidence to the Lords EU committee. He says the government is keen to publish the EU withdrawal agreement bill as soon as possible. But it is not possible to lock down the text while the talks with Labour are still going on, he says. Q: Do you accept MPs need time to see it before the second reading vote in June? Barclay says he does accept that. But he says many of the issues raised by the bill have been debated. He says he published an open letter yesterday (pdf) that he sent to the Tory Brexiter John Redwood addressing some of Redwood\u2019s concerns about the bill. Here are the main points from Liam Fox\u2019s Q&amp;A at the Institute for Government. Fox, the international development secretary, said that the UK would face either a no-deal Brexit or no Brexit if MPs vote down Theresa May\u2019s deal again next month. Referring to the vote, he said: There will be an opportunity for MPs to decide, after the local elections, after the European elections, whether they want to vote for Brexit or not. MPs will need to look and see if they want to continue down a path that inexorably takes us to either the potential of revocation of article 50 or leaving without a deal, and ask if they think that\u2019s the best course either democratically or economically for the UK. MPs will have to face that decision. Fox is assuming that the EU will not allow a further article 50 extension, which is not a view shared by those who follow Brussels politics closely. (See 9.52am.) Bloomberg\u2019s Rob Hutton is not convinced by the latest Fox/Number 10 argument. Fox said it would be \u201cself-defeating\u201d for the UK to lower food safety standards after Brexit. He said: I have said repeatedly that we will not reduce our standards as we move forward ... There\u2019s a trading reason why we shouldn\u2019t want to change our standards, and that\u2019s because of the impact on our exporters. Barclays did a big global survey of consumers about a year ago now and it showed that 59% of Chinese consumers, about 60% of Indian consumers, would pay more for the same product if they knew it came from the United Kingdom. Why? Because you put that little union flag on it and and it\u2019s regarded as a sign of quality. We can\u2019t compete globally at the low-cost, low-quality end of the market. We have too many fixed cost in our economy. We need therefore to compete at the high-quality end of the market. And therefore the maintenance of our high standards is part of that guaranteed quality in the goods that we export. It would be self-defeating to see us reduce our standards. There\u2019s no advantage from a trading perspective in doing so. But Fox also refused to say the UK should continue to ban US imports of chlorine-washed chicken after Brexit, saying the use of this practice was an animal welfare issue, not a food safety issue. Chlorine-washed chicken was safe to eat, he argued. David Henig, director of the UK Trade Policy Project, was not impressed by Fox\u2019s answer on this. Lone parents and their children have lost challenges against the government\u2019s benefit cap at the UK\u2019s highest court, the Press Association reports. Supreme court justices, sitting in London on Wednesday, rejected the appeals in cases brought against the work and pensions secretary over the lawfulness of the measure by a majority of five to two. This is what David Macdonald is saying about why he has abandoned Change UK, despite being their lead candidate in Scotland for the European elections, and is now backing the Lib Dems. (See 10.36am.) [After a] great deal of reflection on the political landscape we are facing in Scotland at present, I have come to the point where I have realised I must do what is best for the future of this country before anything else. If things continue as they are the remain vote will split in Scotland and put at risk the representation that supporters of remaining in the European Union so collectively desire. For that reason I have decided to end my candidacy for Change UK effective immediately and I am now calling for those in favour of remaining in the European Union, including all supporters of Change UK in Scotland, to do what is best for our collective voice in Europe and to support the Scottish Liberal Democrats in the upcoming European election, to better ensure that they gain representation to secure a seat in these European elections. The lead candidate for Change UK in Scotland\u2019s European parliament contest has switched sides to the Liberal Democrats, in further signs the new party is struggling to consolidate itself or spread successfully across the UK. David Macdonald, an independent councillor in the wealthy district of East Renfrewshire near Glasgow, is expected to confirm shortly he has resigned from Change UK in a joint appearance with Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, near Holyrood. The Scottish Lib Dems said Macdonald will \u201cendorse the Liberal Democrats as the party of remain.\u201d Macdonald, a restaurateur, appears to have deleted his Change UK election Twitter account @davidchangeuk. Change UK have made negligible impact in Scotland, and his defection will likely quash any suggestions it will greatly affect the results on May 23. It has been planning to stage its first and only European elections rally in Edinburgh this Saturday but no venue has been announced. Rennie will hope Macdonald\u2019s switch will boost the Lib Dems\u2019 chances in the election. A recent YouGov poll for the Times put Change UK neck and neck with the Lib Dems in Scotland at 6% each, although there is little expectation the Lib Dems are popular enough to win one of the six Scottish seats on offer. Nikki da Costa, who used to work as director of legislative affairs for Theresa May at Number 10, says if the EU withdrawal agreement bill does get through its second reading, the government will have to accept whatever amendments get added. Q: The US has published their objectives for a trade deal with the UK. They want the UK to relax EU-style food standards. Are you happy with that? Fox says he has said until he is \u201cblue in the face\u201d that the UK will not reduce its standards after Brexit. It has legislation that protects food standards. That will not change. And there are trading reasons for this too. A Barclays survey shows that a majority of Indian and Chinese consumers would pay more for British produce, because they see it as high quality. The UK cannot compete on low standards. There would be no advantage lowering standards. Fox says lowering food standards after Brexit would be bad for UK exports. Q: What about chlorine-washed chicken? Fox says that is a different argument. That is about animal welfare, not food safety. From the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith The WAB is the EU withdrawal agreement bill. It is said to be half an inch thick, which makes it an enormous piece of legislation, which explains Smith\u2019s joke about \u201clight reading\u201d. Q: What would be an acceptable result in the European elections? And would you consider voting for the Brexit party in the Euros? Fox says he will be voting for the Conservatives, for various reasons. MEPs will have to deal with a range of issues, he says. He says the Brexit party is a single issue party. And anything that weakens the Conservatives is good for Jeremy Corbyn, he says. On expectations, he says he is a former Tory chairman. Anything he said on this would be expectation management, or evasive. And he says the question has reminded him to send in his postal vote today. Q: There seems to be little chance of the government winning the Brexit vote in June. So is this just a last throw of the dice? And if Theresa May loses, will she has to stand down? Fox says MPs will have to decide whether they want to take the UK down a path that would lead to either a no-deal Brexit, or article 50 being revoked. MPs will have to take that decision. Fox says UK will face either no-deal or no Brexit if MPs do not vote for Theresa May\u2019s deal in June. This is also the line being briefed by Number 10. (See 9.52am.) UPDATE: Here is the quote. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, is now taking questions at the Institute for Government. Q: Your department deals with trade deals outside the EU. But the central trade deal will be with the EU, and your department is not involved in those talks. When will you get involved. Fox says talks are currently going on about how to create a \u201csingle architecture\u201d, so that there is not a divergence between the trade regime with the EU and the trade regime with the rest of the world. Q: What if the UK stays in the customs union? Fox says he does not want to see the UK stay in a customs union. He says other countries would not want to sign trade deals with the UK if it were in a temporary customs union with the EU, and they did not know when it was going to end. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, was on the Today programme this morning. He said that he was a \u201chardliner\u201d on Brexit. But he insisted that the Lib Dems were not blocking progress on the Brexit legislation. They would be happy to vote for the deal, provided it was subject to a confirmatory referendum, he said. He also said that he thought three options should be put to the public in the referendum: the deal, a no-deal Brexit and remain. According to the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith, Number 10 is now arguing that, if Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan gets defeated in early June, the UK will face either a no-deal Brexit at the end of October or article 50 being revoked. This argument is based on the assumption that the EU would not agree to a further extension of article 50. But EU leaders have never said that explicitly, and the conventional wisdom in Brussels is that a further extension, although not guaranteed, is certainly very possible. Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, has just published a very good paper addressing exactly this question. Here is an extract. EU officials don\u2019t trust British MPs to prevent no deal and some of them think it could happen by accident. For example, what if a Boris Johnson-type figure became prime minister in October, and he or she was determined to leave without a deal? That person would refuse to ask for an extension and Parliament would not have time to bring down the government and prevent no deal before October 31st (to which the counter-argument is that no prime minister committed to a no deal Brexit could ever win a parliamentary majority for forming a government in the first place). Some senior figures in Brussels expect the British to receive an extension till June 2020. That is the latest possible date for the EU to agree on its next seven-year budget plan, the multiannual financial framework that starts in 2021, without serious problems arising. In the long run the UK would have to go for an election or referendum or no deal \u2013 or possibly a different kind of Brexit, said one figure. But would not Macron veto further extensions? \u201cNo, he could not resist the pressure from all the others in the room to compromise.\u201d Another official agrees that the 27 are unlikely to force the UK out by refusing a further extension, but adds that this could change if the British elected a fearsome swarm of Faragist MPs in the European elections. Similarly, a new government led by a hard-line eurosceptic committed to starting fights with the EU could lead the patience of some member-states to snap. My colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels also thinks a further article 50 extension is more likely than not. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, is giving a speech at the Institute for Government. There is a live feed here. He started by saying trade policy was only a relatively small part of what his department does (accounting for 20% of staff) and he is now summarising how his department promotes trade. I will post any highlights from the speech and the Q&amp;A. After weeks of procrastination, Theresa May has now announced a date - or rather, three possible dates - for what will be her final attempt to get MPs to vote for her withdrawal agreement. It will be the second reading of the EU withdrawal agreement bill, and it will take place in the week beginning Monday 3 June. But the whitsun recess does not end until the following day, and so the vote will probably take place on either Tuesday 4 June, Wednesday 5 June or Thursday 6 June. Here is the Guardian\u2019s overnight story. So May has three weeks to construct a majority. But it is not there now. Last night the Labour party made it clear that it would not support the bill unless the government strikes a deal with the party over the Brexit outcome it wants and, in a statement, Jeremy Corbyn that was still some way off. The DUP, May\u2019s supposed confidence and supply partners, said they remained opposed to what was on offer. And the smaller opposition parties, the SNP, the Lib Dems and Plaid Cymru, also expressed their continued opposition to the plan. And what about the 34 Conservative who voted against the agreement at the last debate (when other rebels had given in)? Six of them are pro-Europeans, but the rest were hardline Brexiters and one of them, Owen Paterson, told the Today programme this morning that he remained opposed to what was on offer. He said: Sadly, we will vote against it again, as the DUP put out a statement, because it doesn\u2019t change the essential nature of the withdrawal agreement, which is unacceptable we will have laws imposed on us by 27 different countries where we are not involved. And, very importantly for the DUP and us, it potentially breaks up the United Kingdom by creating a new entity called UKNI [UK Northern Ireland] and that means you could end with Scotland wanting to follow and that is really dangerous for the union. We\u2019ll hear from May herself at PMQs. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.05am: Greg Clark, the business secretary, gives a speech at the FT Future of the Car summit. 9.30am: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, gives a speech at the Institute for Government. 10am: Penny Mordaunt, the new defence secretary, gives a speech at the First Sea Lord\u2019s Sea Power Conference. 11.10am: Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, gives evidence to the Lords EU committee. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 2.30pm: Google, YouTube and Instagram give evidence to the Commons culture committee. 4pm: Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, holds a walkabout in Merthyr Tydfil. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.

A former environment minister in Helmut Kohl\u2019s cabinet, Merkel recalled biodiversity conferences she attended in the mid-1990s, and said: \u201cIt is heartbreaking to see how the situation has worsened in so many ways. \u201cThere clearly is a lack of consistent political action, on a global scale. What is key for being able to act in all spheres, including environmental protection, is for us to be economically successful. That is my greatest worry.\u201d She reiterated her aim for Germany to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, but said that for European countries to meet the net-zero carbon emissions target set by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and eight other leaders last week, they would need to reopen a fraught debate about carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. \u201cNine countries intend to attain climate neutrality by 2050, whereby they would on average no longer emit any CO2,\u201d Merkel said of Macron\u2019s initiative. \u201cI am firmly convinced that this can only be done if one is willing to capture and store CO2. The countries in question do not deny this. The method is called CCS \u2013 and for many in Germany it is a highly charged term.\u201d CCS is controversial because critics see it as an expensive subsidy that would ultimately perpetuate rather than reduce reliance on fossil fuels. \u201cThere are two possibilities \u2013 you can either store carbon, or you can reforest on a large scale,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the Netherlands, for example, the latter is not an option. There, CO2 could be pumped into empty gas fields. We could do the same in Germany \u2013 but if I wanted to implement this policy here with the stroke of a pen, then people would be right to ask me how realistic that is.\u201d Merkel would not say whether the EU would grant Britain another extension if Theresa May\u2019s government failed to pass her withdrawal agreement by the end of October deadline. And, asked whether by the autumn Brexit might be being discussed by new leaders in both London and Berlin, she again refused to be drawn, answering: \u201cShould there be anything to negotiate, the European commission will do so on behalf of the 27 member states, as it has done so far.\u201d This article is part of a six-newspaper collaboration called Europa in which work is reported by one or more newspaper and shared for publication with all. The interview was conducted by S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, with the Guardian feeding in questions. The six papers are the Guardian, Le Monde, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, La Vanguardia, La Stampa and Gazeta Wyborcza.",

Even they were surprised, though, when people unanimously said they were prepared to give up flying, change their boilers and cars, eat less meat and even overthrow capitalism to get a grip on climate change.</p> <p>But this was just a straw in the political wind whipping through middle England. Shrewsbury joins <a href=\"https://climateemergency.uk/blog/map-of-local-council-declarations/\" title=\"\">more than 100 other councils across the country</a> in declaring a climate emergency, and has pledged that it will be carbon-neutral within 11 years, with more following every week.</p> <p>The stakes get higher every day.

So let\u2019s act on them | Chris Packham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So, could this be the moment when politicians recognise they have both strong intellectual reason to act urgently on the environment as well as, finally, the public backing to do so? When, instead of trying to score marginal partisan points, they believe they have the legitimacy to be non-partisan, politically bold, and to together back transformative economic and social change in pursuit of the public good? Could politics indeed be changing with the climate?</p> <p>The last few months have seen the debate shift. Put it down to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/28/david-attenborough-documentary-climate-anxiety-bbc\" title=\"\">David Attenborough\u2019s documentary</a>, 1.5 million children on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/26/school-climate-strikes-success-forced-uk-politicians-healthy-planet\" title=\"\">school strike</a>, the charisma of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/26/im-striking-from-school-for-climate-change-too-save-the-world-australians-students-should-too\" title=\"\">Greta Thunberg</a>, or sheer frustration with the political system, but increasing numbers of people now seem to recognise that nature\u2019s wellbeing is a national priority.</p> <p>The UK government, keen to position itself as a world leader on climate, but still promoting flying and roads and less keen to act at home, recognises the moment. Cambridge development economist Sir Partha Dasgupta has been commissioned to conduct a major study on the case for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/06/uk-urged-to-take-lead-on-biodiversity-as-un-issues-urgent-warning-global-assessment-dasgupta\" title=\"\">acting on biodiversity</a>, much as Lord Stern was asked to review the economics of climate change by Gordon Brown in 2006. Stern\u2019s 700-page <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/publication/the-economics-of-climate-change-the-stern-review/\" title=\"\">report</a> added greatly to the debate. But that was 13 years ago, since which time there have been many highly authoritative studies done on environmental economics. No new report is needed. They all argue roughly the same: that it will cost infinitely more for governments to do nothing about biodiversity and climate than to act decisively, and that to delay will increase costs further. Dasgupta can only argue that we must act soon.</p> <p>Besides, while it sounds impressive to bring forward by 30 years the target for net-zero emissions, few countries think it will be too difficult. Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77b0fd1e-7010-11e9-bf5c-6eeb837566c5\" title=\"\">asked</a> the EU to set 2050 as a target for being carbon-neutral, and want 25% of the EU budget to go to fighting climate change. For the moment, governments have little to lose. Most consumers would barely notice the changes needed to get to carbon neutrality in 30 years\u2019 time. Who noticed that Britain has just had the first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/08/britain-passes-1-week-without-coal-power-for-first-time-since-1882\" title=\"\">week</a> in more than 100 years of electricity without coal, or that divestment from fossil fuels has <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2018/12/18/fossil-fuel-divestment-movement-exceeds-8-trillion/\" title=\"\">reached</a> $8tn? People will have to buy electric cars, more efficient fridges and heating systems, and Britain will need vastly more solar capacity, bigger forests and better insulation, but these are mostly easy and popular changes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3232403dbbaffb24f0cc893064625a78796e45af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3232403dbbaffb24f0cc893064625a78796e45af/0_12_4920_2952/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deforestation in the western Amazon region of Brazil.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deforestation in the western Amazon region of Brazil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl de Souza/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A \u201cnew green deal\u201d budget could be brought in to fund a massive push for nature conservation and energy change. The ban on new petrol and diesel cars and vans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/25/britain-to-ban-sale-of-all-diesel-and-petrol-cars-and-vans-from-2040\" title=\"\">after 2040</a> could be brought forward to 2030 easily enough, and few people would object to penalties for climate polluters, higher taxes for companies that destroy nature and incentives for renewable energy and energy conservation. If Heathrow never got its new runway, or we did not build more roads, or we all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/08/save-planet-meat-dairy-livestock-food-free-range-steak\" title=\"\">ate less meat</a>, it would not hurt that much.</p> <p>Indeed, it\u2019s clear that protecting nature brings great collective rewards. Weaning ourselves off fossil fuels would clear up air pollution rapidly and save billions of pounds a year that the NHS must currently spend dealing with heart attacks, asthma, strokes and respiratory illnesses. Cities would become more liveable, the countryside more attractive. Instead of being regarded by government as a costly imposition, action on climate and nature regeneration could be easily recast as visionary politics offering huge public benefits.</p> <p>But what happens when the voluntary measures run out and the warming is not seen to slow because greenhouse gases are so long-lasting? Really addressing climate and biodiversity collapse means rationing carbon. It means no more free ride for extractive industries such as mining, palm oil and forestry companies who profit from environmental destruction.

      "bodyText": "Last week a small campaign group in the staunchly conservative town of Shrewsbury called a public meeting about climate change. The organisers were delighted when 150 people turned up. Even they were surprised, though, when people unanimously said they were prepared to give up flying, change their boilers and cars, eat less meat and even overthrow capitalism to get a grip on climate change. But this was just a straw in the political wind whipping through middle England. Shrewsbury joins more than 100 other councils across the country in declaring a climate emergency, and has pledged that it will be carbon-neutral within 11 years, with more following every week. The stakes get higher every day. In the past week, not only have the world\u2019s leading scientists dropped a bomb into the debate by stating, across 1,800 pages of detailed evidence, that our wholesale destruction of the biosphere threatens humanity just as much as climate change, but carbon levels in the atmosphere have reached their highest level in 800,000 years. So, could this be the moment when politicians recognise they have both strong intellectual reason to act urgently on the environment as well as, finally, the public backing to do so? When, instead of trying to score marginal partisan points, they believe they have the legitimacy to be non-partisan, politically bold, and to together back transformative economic and social change in pursuit of the public good? Could politics indeed be changing with the climate? The last few months have seen the debate shift. Put it down to David Attenborough\u2019s documentary, 1.5 million children on school strike, the charisma of Greta Thunberg, or sheer frustration with the political system, but increasing numbers of people now seem to recognise that nature\u2019s wellbeing is a national priority. The UK government, keen to position itself as a world leader on climate, but still promoting flying and roads and less keen to act at home, recognises the moment. Cambridge development economist Sir Partha Dasgupta has been commissioned to conduct a major study on the case for acting on biodiversity, much as Lord Stern was asked to review the economics of climate change by Gordon Brown in 2006. Stern\u2019s 700-page report added greatly to the debate. But that was 13 years ago, since which time there have been many highly authoritative studies done on environmental economics. No new report is needed. They all argue roughly the same: that it will cost infinitely more for governments to do nothing about biodiversity and climate than to act decisively, and that to delay will increase costs further. Dasgupta can only argue that we must act soon. Besides, while it sounds impressive to bring forward by 30 years the target for net-zero emissions, few countries think it will be too difficult. Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden have asked the EU to set 2050 as a target for being carbon-neutral, and want 25% of the EU budget to go to fighting climate change. For the moment, governments have little to lose. Most consumers would barely notice the changes needed to get to carbon neutrality in 30 years\u2019 time. Who noticed that Britain has just had the first week in more than 100 years of electricity without coal, or that divestment from fossil fuels has reached $8tn? People will have to buy electric cars, more efficient fridges and heating systems, and Britain will need vastly more solar capacity, bigger forests and better insulation, but these are mostly easy and popular changes. A \u201cnew green deal\u201d budget could be brought in to fund a massive push for nature conservation and energy change. The ban on new petrol and diesel cars and vans after 2040 could be brought forward to 2030 easily enough, and few people would object to penalties for climate polluters, higher taxes for companies that destroy nature and incentives for renewable energy and energy conservation. If Heathrow never got its new runway, or we did not build more roads, or we all ate less meat, it would not hurt that much. Indeed, it\u2019s clear that protecting nature brings great collective rewards. Weaning ourselves off fossil fuels would clear up air pollution rapidly and save billions of pounds a year that the NHS must currently spend dealing with heart attacks, asthma, strokes and respiratory illnesses. Cities would become more liveable, the countryside more attractive. Instead of being regarded by government as a costly imposition, action on climate and nature regeneration could be easily recast as visionary politics offering huge public benefits. But what happens when the voluntary measures run out and the warming is not seen to slow because greenhouse gases are so long-lasting? Really addressing climate and biodiversity collapse means rationing carbon. It means no more free ride for extractive industries such as mining, palm oil and forestry companies who profit from environmental destruction. It means heavy penalties for polluters, the axing of food and aviation subsidies, and taking a torch to vested interests. It means addressing the indirect causes of the crisis, such as population growth and consumerism, even rethinking the whole idea of progress and wealth. There are dangers in both action and inaction. How will rich countries react to mass migrations from poor climate-affected countries, or to the breakdown of the food system that might ensue when climate change leads to disastrous harvests in major rice- and wheat-producing countries? Already, the UN says, there are around 2,500 conflicts over fossil fuels, water, food and land. Climate change and biodiversity loss will only increase that number. Then there is the risk that the climate crisis could foster a new generation of authoritarian, top-down rulers who will try bypassing consumers and institutions. This is because it necessitates a major shift from the kind of individual responsibility we have grown used to in the past 50 years, to greater state action. That could easily be exploited. It also opens the door for rich governments to propose dangerous and ill-thought-through technological fixes as a substitute for mitigation. How much simpler for cash-strapped governments to ask a few billionaires to help slow warming in the US or Europe by funding a monstrously expensive plan to preserve the Arctic sea ice by covering it with a layer of reflective silica \u201cmicrobubbles\u201d; or to deflect the sun\u2019s rays in space; or to spray the oceans with iron filings? But the risks of doing nothing far outweigh the possible pitfalls of really addressing climate change and biodiversity collapse. Of course there will be objections from diehard capitalists and liberals alike. But, to echo Margaret Thatcher as she pushed through the deregulation that has done so much to fuel the crisis: there really is no alternative. \u2022 John Vidal is a former Guardian environment editor",
