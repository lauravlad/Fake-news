      "body": "<p>It will be no news to anyone that the coal industry is a pretty big deal in our economy \u2013 it is our biggest export and a major source of economic growth. We do however get a bit overexcited about it as we get trapped into thinking the Australian economy is all about mining and any hits to it means we are effectively stuffed. Events this week showed that we need to start preparing for life without it.</p> <p>With the exception of a few years when iron ore exports were boosted, coal has long been our major export. Japan is the biggest destination, but around 20% of it goes to China. Even so, the coal mining sector is not quite as important as you might think. It accounts for less growth in our economy than iron ore mining, or indeed something as mundane as the retail sector. So while we do need to be concerned about the mining sector, it\u2019s when people stop buying things in our shops that we\u2019ll know we\u2019re in recession territory.</p> <p>But this week everyone got a bit more concerned about coal because of two reasons. The first was that Australian\u2019s biggest miner of coal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/20/glencore-to-limit-coal-production-after-pressure-from-investors-church-of-england\">Glencore, announced</a> that it would limit coal production. Notionally this was due to \u201cinvestor concerns\u201d about the environment, but as finance journalist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelWestBiz/status/1098496472251682816\">Michael West noted</a>, \u201cGlencore is ruthless.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The only ones still seeing a future in coal are those not in the mining industry, and mostly those on the government benches</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mining companies don\u2019t start limiting mining just because they are overcome by the warm fuzzies of shareholders being concerned about climate change.

      "bodyText": "It will be no news to anyone that the coal industry is a pretty big deal in our economy \u2013 it is our biggest export and a major source of economic growth. We do however get a bit overexcited about it as we get trapped into thinking the Australian economy is all about mining and any hits to it means we are effectively stuffed. Events this week showed that we need to start preparing for life without it. With the exception of a few years when iron ore exports were boosted, coal has long been our major export. Japan is the biggest destination, but around 20% of it goes to China. Even so, the coal mining sector is not quite as important as you might think. It accounts for less growth in our economy than iron ore mining, or indeed something as mundane as the retail sector. So while we do need to be concerned about the mining sector, it\u2019s when people stop buying things in our shops that we\u2019ll know we\u2019re in recession territory. But this week everyone got a bit more concerned about coal because of two reasons. The first was that Australian\u2019s biggest miner of coal, Glencore, announced that it would limit coal production. Notionally this was due to \u201cinvestor concerns\u201d about the environment, but as finance journalist Michael West noted, \u201cGlencore is ruthless.\u201d Mining companies don\u2019t start limiting mining just because they are overcome by the warm fuzzies of shareholders being concerned about climate change. They know it is fast becoming a stranded asset \u2013 an asset that, due to changes in technology (or in this case, responses to climate change), becomes a liability to hold. Glencore is not the only mining company no longer seeing as much lustre in coal as in the past. BHP on Tuesday released its latest \u201ceconomic and commodity outlook\u201d, in which it said that \u201cby the end of next decade on a conservative estimate\u201d it expected coal to \u201close competitiveness to renewables on a new-build basis in the developed world and in China\u201d. In October last year Rio Tinto sold the last of its remaining coal assets. You don\u2019t do that if you think it has a glowing future. Pretty much the only ones still seeing a future in coal are those not in the mining industry, and mostly those on the government benches. It must also be said that the ALP remains rather too pussy footed about the coal industry \u2013 wanting to talk about it having a future (that no one really believes, or believes will be anything like it has had in the past) and being far too limp on the Adani coal mine. But coal for now remains important to the economy, which is why the second bit of news on Thursday that the major Chinese port of Dalian had indefinitely banned further imports of Australian coal spooked both markets and the government. Given coal imports from Russia and Indonesia were not being affected by any ban, it was clearly a pointed and political step. As a result of the news, the value of dollar fell 1% to $US0.71, although we should not panic too much about that \u2013 the dollar has been sitting around that level since October. The Chinese government has suggested that it was \u201cnormal practice\u201d, as customs officials had assessed \u201cthe safety and quality of imported coal\u201d and analysed \u201cpossible risks, and conducts corresponding examination and inspection compliant with laws and regulations\u201d. So why Australia? Is it because of the government last year banning Chinese telecommunications companies Huawei and ZTE from supplying equipment to Australia\u2019s 5G network? Or suggestions China was involved in the hacking of Australia\u2019s major political parties? (And throw in for good measure Senator Barry Sullivan this week using \u201cChinaman\u201d as a slur?) For his part the governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, was trying to placate fears by telling the House economics committee on Friday that while a ban was \u201cundesirable\u201d that \u201cwhether it\u2019s a disaster we have to wait and see\u201d. He added, \u201cIf it were to be the sign of a deterioration in the underlying political relationship between Australia and China then that would be more concerning.\u201d Now clearly there are many forces at work, such as China pushing its weight around. But China is also, as Lowe noted, \u201ctrying to contain production of steel for environmental reasons.\u201d The Chinese coal industry is also not doing all that well, and so China could be just engaging in a bit of a trade battle to help it out. But none of these are particularly great news for the Australian coal industry, and if China has decidedly taken a step against Australia, it does not bode well for our economy. But Josh Frydenberg is right when he argues that the trade between Australia and China is mutually beneficial, so one would expect any fight will be limited. It does however highlight just how much bulldust was being spread around when the government was talking up the benefits of our free trade agreement with China. So much for it being, as then foreign minister Julie Bishop said, \u201ca major step in cementing closer economic relations with China\u201d and that it would \u201cbe the catalyst for even further mutual gain between our two countries\u201d. Regardless of why this is happening, it should serve as yet another wake up call to politicians of both major parties. We cannot rely on coal for our future prosperity. We must be planning for life without it. It is going to be tough and it will leave some worse off, and will require a major adjustment of our economy.

      "body": "<p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than not being able to get past a certain point, which I thought was never ending,\u201d Nathan Redmond says. Over his shoulder, the skies are starting to darken at Southampton\u2019s impressive training ground on the fringes of the New Forest. Fresh from another demanding session after a week in Tenerife under the watchful eye of his club\u2019s workaholic manager, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, Redmond is reflecting on a challenging period of his career that saw him miss the decisive penalty for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/27/england-germany-european-under-21-championship-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">England against Germany in the European Under-21 Championship</a> semi-finals as well as be booed off by his own club\u2019s supporters.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t doing anything right, I hadn\u2019t scored a goal and was not performing for my team,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were so many things going on and I wasn\u2019t doing anything to change it. I guess I had to go through all of those things to realise how fortunate I am to be playing football. But at the same time I don\u2019t want to end up being somebody who wastes something I\u2019ve been blessed with.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/30/nathan-redmond-defends-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-southampton\">Nathan Redmond defends Manchester City\u2019s Guardiola over pep talk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ever since he became Birmingham\u2019s second-youngest player at 16 years and 173 days in 2010, there has been no doubting Redmond\u2019s talent. Now 24, he has scored six goals in his past 11 appearances since Hasenh\u00fcttl replaced Mark Hughes. He has recaptured some of the form that brought him his solitary senior England cap, as a substitute away to Germany, two years ago next month. But having been tipped as the brightest star of his generation after turning down some of the biggest clubs to stay with his hometown team, the period since that sole senior appearance has been what he describes as \u201cthe biggest learning curve of my life\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got rid of a lot of things that I had been allowing to happen,\u201d Redmond says. \u201cOne negative thought was leading to another and the smallest of things was getting me down. I didn\u2019t understand how to deal with them the right way but the lessons will keep coming until you do that. I can\u2019t be mad at anything that has happened.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If one of the world's best coaches is telling me I\u2019m good and I\u2019m still not feeling it ... it proves I had work to do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His problems began during the under-21s\u2019 tournament in June, when he injured a hamstring in the final group match against the hosts, Poland. It was diagnosed as a tear that would normally require at least three weeks\u2019 rest but he decided to stay with the squad and came on as a substitute against Germany\u2019s youngsters five days later.</p> <p>\u201cI should have gone home,\u201d Redmond admits. \u201cI don\u2019t think I fully understood how bad it was until I came back and thought: \u2018Maybe I should have made this decision.\u2019 But it was my last tournament for them and I wanted to give everything I could. I know a lot of the younger boys coming through did look up to me to be a leader off the pitch because I\u2019d had a lot of experience and had been playing football from a young age as well.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.<br></strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>The abiding image of England\u2019s defeat that night was Redmond being consoled by his friend Nathaniel Chalobah, his eyes bloodshot from the tears that had been flowing steadily since his miss in the shootout. He admits following in the footsteps of Stuart Pearce, Chris Waddle, Gareth Southgate, David Batty and the rest who have missed spot-kicks in national colours had a profound effect as his confidence nosedived, culminating in Pep Guardiola\u2019s impassioned intervention on the pitch at the end of Southampton\u2019s defeat by Manchester City in December 2017. Having reminded Redmond \u201chow good a player he is\u201d, the manager <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/01/pep-guardiola-asked-by-fa-to-explain-animated-conversation-with-nathan-redmon-manchester-city\" title=\"\">later revealed</a> he had \u201csaid to Nathan: \u2018You have to attack because you have the quality to do that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Yet such was the disintegration of confidence that Redmond admits it took six months before the significance of Guardiola\u2019s praise sank in. \u201cWhen I was younger there was a lot of expectation and hype \u2013 I always believed I was a good player but not always 100%,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t fixed up my head after Pep Guardiola spoke to me and told me what a good player I was \u2026 maybe some other players would be like: \u2018OK I can do this.\u2019 But it took me until the summer. If one of the best coaches in the world is telling me I\u2019m a good player and I\u2019m still not feeling it, that just proves I had a lot of work to do myself. There were a series of games when I wasn\u2019t in the squad at Southampton, I was training with the under-23s \u2013 there was a lot of stuff going on. I was thinking: \u2018Why has this happened to me?\u2019 instead of trying to change and looking at things that were right in front of me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a552c77396cdfcd89dd66cbfeee64f99732cca0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a552c77396cdfcd89dd66cbfeee64f99732cca0d/89_69_1900_1140/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pep Guardiola berates Nathan Redmond at the end of Southampton\u2019s defeat to Manchester City in November 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pep Guardiola berates Nathan Redmond at the end of Southampton\u2019s defeat to Manchester City in November 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt West/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Redmond adds: \u201cWhen Mark Hughes came in he understood I was in a bit of a bad place in terms of confidence.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than not being able to get past a certain point, which I thought was never ending,\u201d Nathan Redmond says. Over his shoulder, the skies are starting to darken at Southampton\u2019s impressive training ground on the fringes of the New Forest. Fresh from another demanding session after a week in Tenerife under the watchful eye of his club\u2019s workaholic manager, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, Redmond is reflecting on a challenging period of his career that saw him miss the decisive penalty for England against Germany in the European Under-21 Championship semi-finals as well as be booed off by his own club\u2019s supporters. \u201cI wasn\u2019t doing anything right, I hadn\u2019t scored a goal and was not performing for my team,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were so many things going on and I wasn\u2019t doing anything to change it. I guess I had to go through all of those things to realise how fortunate I am to be playing football. But at the same time I don\u2019t want to end up being somebody who wastes something I\u2019ve been blessed with.\u201d Ever since he became Birmingham\u2019s second-youngest player at 16 years and 173 days in 2010, there has been no doubting Redmond\u2019s talent. Now 24, he has scored six goals in his past 11 appearances since Hasenh\u00fcttl replaced Mark Hughes. He has recaptured some of the form that brought him his solitary senior England cap, as a substitute away to Germany, two years ago next month. But having been tipped as the brightest star of his generation after turning down some of the biggest clubs to stay with his hometown team, the period since that sole senior appearance has been what he describes as \u201cthe biggest learning curve of my life\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve got rid of a lot of things that I had been allowing to happen,\u201d Redmond says. \u201cOne negative thought was leading to another and the smallest of things was getting me down. I didn\u2019t understand how to deal with them the right way but the lessons will keep coming until you do that. I can\u2019t be mad at anything that has happened.\u201d His problems began during the under-21s\u2019 tournament in June, when he injured a hamstring in the final group match against the hosts, Poland. It was diagnosed as a tear that would normally require at least three weeks\u2019 rest but he decided to stay with the squad and came on as a substitute against Germany\u2019s youngsters five days later. \u201cI should have gone home,\u201d Redmond admits. \u201cI don\u2019t think I fully understood how bad it was until I came back and thought: \u2018Maybe I should have made this decision.\u2019 But it was my last tournament for them and I wanted to give everything I could. I know a lot of the younger boys coming through did look up to me to be a leader off the pitch because I\u2019d had a lot of experience and had been playing football from a young age as well.\u201d The abiding image of England\u2019s defeat that night was Redmond being consoled by his friend Nathaniel Chalobah, his eyes bloodshot from the tears that had been flowing steadily since his miss in the shootout. He admits following in the footsteps of Stuart Pearce, Chris Waddle, Gareth Southgate, David Batty and the rest who have missed spot-kicks in national colours had a profound effect as his confidence nosedived, culminating in Pep Guardiola\u2019s impassioned intervention on the pitch at the end of Southampton\u2019s defeat by Manchester City in December 2017. Having reminded Redmond \u201chow good a player he is\u201d, the manager later revealed he had \u201csaid to Nathan: \u2018You have to attack because you have the quality to do that.\u2019\u201d Yet such was the disintegration of confidence that Redmond admits it took six months before the significance of Guardiola\u2019s praise sank in. \u201cWhen I was younger there was a lot of expectation and hype \u2013 I always believed I was a good player but not always 100%,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t fixed up my head after Pep Guardiola spoke to me and told me what a good player I was \u2026 maybe some other players would be like: \u2018OK I can do this.\u2019 But it took me until the summer. If one of the best coaches in the world is telling me I\u2019m a good player and I\u2019m still not feeling it, that just proves I had a lot of work to do myself. There were a series of games when I wasn\u2019t in the squad at Southampton, I was training with the under-23s \u2013 there was a lot of stuff going on. I was thinking: \u2018Why has this happened to me?\u2019 instead of trying to change and looking at things that were right in front of me.\u201d Redmond adds: \u201cWhen Mark Hughes came in he understood I was in a bit of a bad place in terms of confidence. I remember having a conversation with my mum and I was thinking: \u2018This is it.\u2019 I didn\u2019t know if I was still going to be at the club or play again. That was the kind of doom-and-gloom outlook I had.\u201d Working with the fitness expert Andy Barr along with Liverpool\u2019s Daniel Sturridge and Chalobah \u2013 who is second on England Under\u201121s\u2019 appearance list with 40 games, two ahead of Redmond \u2013 he says spending last summer preparing in Los Angeles worked wonders not only for his physical condition but also his mental health. Yet it was not until Hasenh\u00fcttl was appointed that he realised the extent of his slump. \u201cI almost thought I had reached my limitations. I came back at the start of the season and I thought I was playing pretty well but then the new manager came in and said: \u2018You\u2019ve got no goals and no assists in the league \u2026 what\u2019s going on?\u2019 We had a review in Tenerife and he\u2019s like: \u2018Look at what you\u2019ve done the space of three months.\u2019 We had a long discussion about everything but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever scored so many goals in my career, so it made me think: \u2018What if I had been doing this six or seven years ago?\u2019 That\u2019s what is exciting for me and hopefully I can keep it going.\u201d The pain of their morale-sapping defeat against Cardiff at St Mary\u2019s is still raw and Redmond admits they are desperate to make up for that against Arsenal on Sunday after slipping back into the relegation zone. He believes Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s notoriously exhausting approach to training is starting to rub off on the players and is confident there will be no need for the heroics that saw Saints survive by the skin of their teeth last season. \u201cWe have a little bit of time before it gets to that stage \u2013 we can still put it right,\u201d Redmond says with steely determination in his eyes. \u201cBut the quicker we do it the better.\u201d After the last two years, he knows he has no time to waste.",

      "body": "<p>When seven Labour MPs appeared at a packed Westminster press conference to announce their dramatic departure from the party on Monday, one of their colleagues was thinking about what might have been. Just two weeks earlier, the Labour MP had been all set to join them.</p> \n<p>Already harbouring concerns about the timing of the announcement, it was a conversation with his mother that ultimately caused him to hold fire. \u201cShe just said: \u2018Don\u2019t give up your career for them. The Labour party needs sensible people to fight.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Over the past few weeks, many Labour MPs concerned about the party\u2019s direction have been engaged in emotional conversations with family and friends as they try to weigh up whether they should follow suit and leave the party that most believed they would spend their lives involved in. Of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/18/in-their-own-words-why-seven-mps-are-quitting-labour-independent-group\" title=\"\">seven MPs who initially took the plunge</a>, it was Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree, who was the most surprising figure.

Her departure has made it more difficult for a lot of us. The others had been pursuing a kamikaze strategy, but she has been pushed to this place. She gives the whole thing more weight and credibility.\u201d</p> \n<p>The other six MPs who left on Monday \u2013 Chuka Umunna, Chris Leslie, Angela Smith, Mike Gapes, Gavin Shuker and Ann Coffey \u2013 had been vehement critics of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s politics and leading supporters of a second referendum that the Labour leader has resisted. Berger, however, had been the victim of vicious antisemitic abuse.</p> \n<p>After months of hushed conversations and secret meetings, the Independent Group (TIG) was formed, defining itself as centrist, non-ideological and internationalist. In other words, an attempted antidote to the bitter political divisions that have become a stark feature of British politics.</p> \n<p>Such was the relative lack of organisation that they had no idea they were going to be joined soon after by an eighth Labour MP, Joan Ryan, spurred into action by Berger\u2019s testimony. Likewise, the three Tory MPs who later joined the group had no prior warning about the timing of the Labour resignations. After a brief discussion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/20/three-tory-mps-poised-to-quit-party-and-join-independent-group\" title=\"\">Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen</a> announced their Tory resignations on Wednesday. By that afternoon, the new group were taking selfies as they sat together in the Commons chamber for Prime Minister\u2019s Questions.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what brought it home for me \u2013 my friends, who often sat with me, now sitting over on different benches with former Conservatives,\u201d said a Labour MP. \u201cIt had to happen, but it\u2019s just really sad. That\u2019s what I feel about it.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We could be looking at very significant changes in the structure of British politics</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Lord Hutton</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>While the group is made up of both Tory and Labour MPs, the pool of possible Conservative defectors is very small \u2013 limited to a group of MPs who back a second referendum, or face deselection. Conversely, Labour is divided on many fronts. Many MPs are angry about antisemitism allegations and Brexit. However, the split has also refocused attention on a perceived narrowing of tolerance for political differences, resulting in a hostile party environment that MPs believe is tolerated by the leadership. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/22/labour-mp-ian-austin-quits-the-party\" title=\"\">resignation on Friday of Ian Austin</a>, a Labour MP opposed to a second referendum but unable to support Corbyn\u2019s politics, confirmed that wider and more profound fissure.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0fe1cd3d-9163-4540-b220-92d8818b7e97\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/o_9R7htKYv4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The <em>Observer</em> has spoken to Labour MPs, peers and supporters who are all on the verge of quitting. \u201cI know personally there are up to 20 MPs sitting on the cliff edge,\u201d said one MP. \u201cThe interesting thing is of the 20, it\u2019s whether they jump or are kicked off.\u201d Another said: \u201c100%, more will go.\u201d Several peers are also considering their position. \u201cIn many cases they\u2019ve had 50 or 60 years of membership,\u201d said one. \u201cIt is a wrench. However, there are people in the \u2018not if, but when\u2019 mode.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some MPs have had to see the funny side of the turmoil that was unleashed. \u201cI\u2019ve had two groups coming to me,\u201d said one MP close to the defectors. \u201cOne group saying: \u2018Come and join us, this is the new thing.\u2019 And another saying: \u2018Why don\u2019t you fuck off and join your mates.\u2019 But I think going would let [the leadership] off the hook.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many MPs said one of the most remarkable moments of the week came when Tom Watson, the party\u2019s deputy leader, said the decision by the Labour resigners was premature. It was taken by many as tacit acknowledgement that a more serious split is likely. Prominent figures from the New Labour years believe something bigger is happening. Former cabinet minister John Hutton said: \u201cBrexit is straining the fibres that keep our main parties together very profoundly. Depending on how things go over the next couple of weeks, we could be looking at very significant changes in the structure of British politics.\u201d</p> \n<p>The reaction from the Labour leader and his allies has been inconsistent. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has attempted to sympathise with Berger\u2019s case and suggested the party is edging towards support for a second referendum \u2013 and is fighting for changes to the way Corbyn\u2019s office is run. There is also some action against antisemitism. The party is set to appoint Charlie Falconer, the former lord chancellor, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/22/labour-seeks-to-stem-antisemitism-crisis-after-mp-ian-austin-quits\" title=\"\">review its complaints procedures</a>. The idea has been discussed for some time and was originally proposed by former Labour leader Ed Miliband.</p> \n<p>However, Corbyn on Saturday went on the attack, expressing disappointment that former Labour MPs had opted to \u201cjoin forces with disaffected Tories, who say they have no problem with austerity that has plunged thousands into desperate poverty and insecurity\u201d. His team believes their ace card is that far from representing change, the new group actually represents a failed centre-ground politics incapable of dealing with the country\u2019s problems.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8346d7b904c5603f32e5815003cf5dc5f93e492f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8346d7b904c5603f32e5815003cf5dc5f93e492f/71_0_5330_3199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"British politicians Anna Soubry, center, Heidi Allen, second left, and Sarah Wollaston, right\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tory MPs Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry andAnna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston quit the Conservatives to join the Independent Group.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There are three clear demands being presented to Corbyn by senior figures \u2013 review Labour\u2019s approach to antisemitism, back a second referendum and head off any attempts to trigger the deselection of MPs. Three party sources told the <em>Observer</em> that some Corbyn allies want to begin reselections of about 50 Labour MPs by the end of the year. This allegation is flatly denied by the party.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, there are big hurdles for TIG MPs in the immediate future. Many Labour MPs perceived as sharing their politics have not opted to jump ship just yet, with some fellow travellers warning they will soon attempt to \u201cput clear water\u201d between themselves and the splitters. Ideological problems may yet emerge when the new group sits down on Monday and begins hammering out the details of becoming a coherent party \u2013 and is forced to consider thorny issues such as public spending, tax rates and welfare. While money should not be an issue for TIG \u2013 the <em>Observer</em> is aware of at least two former Labour donors who have already backed it \u2013 Labour will attack it for taking money from wealthy backers.</p> \n<p>Supporters are well aware that the nature of Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system means the group may get nowhere. \u201cMy only concern is whether this just disappears in a puff of smoke,\u201d said one donor. \u201cI just wonder if there\u2019s a natural leader there. It needs someone with real clout in the party.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet even Labour MPs who refused to make the jump to the new group say that it already has influence. Senior figures in the shadow cabinet now believe Corbyn\u2019s team will try to stem the flow of defections by backing an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/21/starmer-pm-is-running-down-clock-so-mps-only-get-binary-choice\" title=\"\">amendment by Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson</a> that would see May\u2019s Brexit deal passed on condition that it is put to a public vote. Should the people reject the deal, Britain would stay in the EU.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt feels like the leadership will now back the Kyle amendment and if you\u2019d told me that just two weeks ago, I would\u2019ve been very doubtful,\u201d says one Labour MP. Another pro-Remain Labour figure said: \u201cIf they want to put a tourniquet around TIG so that it doesn\u2019t affect the whole party they have to stop the bleeding soon, and that is why they are moving on a people\u2019s vote.\u201dAnd what of the Lib Dems in this fledgling realignment? For one thing, said Lib Dem leader Vince Cable, it would help if TIG had a working office and phone. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like the old Henry Kissinger quote: \u2018Who do I call when I call Europe?\u2019 It\u2019s quite difficult to talk to them because they haven\u2019t got a telephone. But I have written to them saying: \u2018Let\u2019s be sensible about this and sit down and talk.\u2019 And I think when they have settled down next week we can have meaningful conversations.\u201d</p> \n<p>He had one early piece of policy advice for the group \u2013 back a new voting system. \u201cWe have had to learn to adapt to the British system, we would love to change it, and maybe this new group will be allies in helping us change that,\u201d he said. \u201cThis new group has demonstrated there is an appetite for things to move more quickly. But they will die unless they can manage to change the system.\u201d</p>",

In other words, an attempted antidote to the bitter political divisions that have become a stark feature of British politics. Such was the relative lack of organisation that they had no idea they were going to be joined soon after by an eighth Labour MP, Joan Ryan, spurred into action by Berger\u2019s testimony. Likewise, the three Tory MPs who later joined the group had no prior warning about the timing of the Labour resignations. After a brief discussion, Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen announced their Tory resignations on Wednesday. By that afternoon, the new group were taking selfies as they sat together in the Commons chamber for Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. \u201cThat\u2019s what brought it home for me \u2013 my friends, who often sat with me, now sitting over on different benches with former Conservatives,\u201d said a Labour MP. \u201cIt had to happen, but it\u2019s just really sad. That\u2019s what I feel about it.\u201d While the group is made up of both Tory and Labour MPs, the pool of possible Conservative defectors is very small \u2013 limited to a group of MPs who back a second referendum, or face deselection. Conversely, Labour is divided on many fronts. Many MPs are angry about antisemitism allegations and Brexit. However, the split has also refocused attention on a perceived narrowing of tolerance for political differences, resulting in a hostile party environment that MPs believe is tolerated by the leadership. The resignation on Friday of Ian Austin, a Labour MP opposed to a second referendum but unable to support Corbyn\u2019s politics, confirmed that wider and more profound fissure. The Observer has spoken to Labour MPs, peers and supporters who are all on the verge of quitting. \u201cI know personally there are up to 20 MPs sitting on the cliff edge,\u201d said one MP. \u201cThe interesting thing is of the 20, it\u2019s whether they jump or are kicked off.\u201d Another said: \u201c100%, more will go.\u201d Several peers are also considering their position. \u201cIn many cases they\u2019ve had 50 or 60 years of membership,\u201d said one. \u201cIt is a wrench. However, there are people in the \u2018not if, but when\u2019 mode.\u201d Some MPs have had to see the funny side of the turmoil that was unleashed. \u201cI\u2019ve had two groups coming to me,\u201d said one MP close to the defectors. \u201cOne group saying: \u2018Come and join us, this is the new thing.\u2019 And another saying: \u2018Why don\u2019t you fuck off and join your mates.\u2019 But I think going would let [the leadership] off the hook.\u201d Many MPs said one of the most remarkable moments of the week came when Tom Watson, the party\u2019s deputy leader, said the decision by the Labour resigners was premature. It was taken by many as tacit acknowledgement that a more serious split is likely. Prominent figures from the New Labour years believe something bigger is happening. Former cabinet minister John Hutton said: \u201cBrexit is straining the fibres that keep our main parties together very profoundly. Depending on how things go over the next couple of weeks, we could be looking at very significant changes in the structure of British politics.\u201d The reaction from the Labour leader and his allies has been inconsistent. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has attempted to sympathise with Berger\u2019s case and suggested the party is edging towards support for a second referendum \u2013 and is fighting for changes to the way Corbyn\u2019s office is run. There is also some action against antisemitism. The party is set to appoint Charlie Falconer, the former lord chancellor, to review its complaints procedures. The idea has been discussed for some time and was originally proposed by former Labour leader Ed Miliband. However, Corbyn on Saturday went on the attack, expressing disappointment that former Labour MPs had opted to \u201cjoin forces with disaffected Tories, who say they have no problem with austerity that has plunged thousands into desperate poverty and insecurity\u201d. His team believes their ace card is that far from representing change, the new group actually represents a failed centre-ground politics incapable of dealing with the country\u2019s problems. There are three clear demands being presented to Corbyn by senior figures \u2013 review Labour\u2019s approach to antisemitism, back a second referendum and head off any attempts to trigger the deselection of MPs. Three party sources told the Observer that some Corbyn allies want to begin reselections of about 50 Labour MPs by the end of the year. This allegation is flatly denied by the party. Meanwhile, there are big hurdles for TIG MPs in the immediate future. Many Labour MPs perceived as sharing their politics have not opted to jump ship just yet, with some fellow travellers warning they will soon attempt to \u201cput clear water\u201d between themselves and the splitters. Ideological problems may yet emerge when the new group sits down on Monday and begins hammering out the details of becoming a coherent party \u2013 and is forced to consider thorny issues such as public spending, tax rates and welfare. While money should not be an issue for TIG \u2013 the Observer is aware of at least two former Labour donors who have already backed it \u2013 Labour will attack it for taking money from wealthy backers. Supporters are well aware that the nature of Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system means the group may get nowhere. \u201cMy only concern is whether this just disappears in a puff of smoke,\u201d said one donor. \u201cI just wonder if there\u2019s a natural leader there. It needs someone with real clout in the party.\u201d Yet even Labour MPs who refused to make the jump to the new group say that it already has influence. Senior figures in the shadow cabinet now believe Corbyn\u2019s team will try to stem the flow of defections by backing an amendment by Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson that would see May\u2019s Brexit deal passed on condition that it is put to a public vote. Should the people reject the deal, Britain would stay in the EU. \u201cIt feels like the leadership will now back the Kyle amendment and if you\u2019d told me that just two weeks ago, I would\u2019ve been very doubtful,\u201d says one Labour MP. Another pro-Remain Labour figure said: \u201cIf they want to put a tourniquet around TIG so that it doesn\u2019t affect the whole party they have to stop the bleeding soon, and that is why they are moving on a people\u2019s vote.\u201dAnd what of the Lib Dems in this fledgling realignment? For one thing, said Lib Dem leader Vince Cable, it would help if TIG had a working office and phone. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like the old Henry Kissinger quote: \u2018Who do I call when I call Europe?\u2019 It\u2019s quite difficult to talk to them because they haven\u2019t got a telephone. But I have written to them saying: \u2018Let\u2019s be sensible about this and sit down and talk.\u2019 And I think when they have settled down next week we can have meaningful conversations.\u201d He had one early piece of policy advice for the group \u2013 back a new voting system. \u201cWe have had to learn to adapt to the British system, we would love to change it, and maybe this new group will be allies in helping us change that,\u201d he said. \u201cThis new group has demonstrated there is an appetite for things to move more quickly. But they will die unless they can manage to change the system.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The high street in Wavertree, south Liverpool, is not what you\u2019d call a bustling location. Most of its shops are either shuttered or have seen better times. Even the old Grade II-listed town hall, which had a failed reinvention as a restaurant, is now closed down. Over its Palladian entrance remains the original Latin motto, <em>sub umbra floresco</em>: \u201cI thrive in the shade.\u201d</p> <p>To judge by the area\u2019s recent political dramas, it\u2019s a phrase that hasn\u2019t gone out of fashion. Last week, the constituency\u2019s sitting MP, Luciana Berger, announced that she was quitting the Labour party to join the Independent Group. Among the reasons she gave for leaving was growing antisemitism within Labour.</p> <p>On the same day she departed, it was revealed that Derek Hatton, the controversial former deputy leader of Liverpool council and Militant Tendency member, had been readmitted to the party in the nearby Riverside constituency, whose Jewish MP, Louise Ellman, is under threat of deselection. But he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/20/derek-hatton-suspended-from-labour-over-tweet\" title=\"\">quickly suspended</a> after a six-year-old antisemitic tweet came to light.</p> <p>The people of Wavertree had mixed feelings about these shady goings-on. At the Liverpool Cat Welfare shop, the owner, Jean Ellis, lamented the area\u2019s decline, saying the high street had never recovered from the closure of its post office. She was sad about Berger because she liked her. \u201cShe\u2019s very sincere. Very nice,\u201d she said.</p> <p>What did she think about the allegations of antisemitism? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, looking bemused. \u201cAll the wars are about religion.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Brown, who supplements his pension by selling sausages to the local pubs, also said he was sad Berger was gone. \u201cShe didn\u2019t deserve to be treated that way,\u201d he said, adding as an unthinking afterthought, \u201ceven though she is Jewish.\u201d</p> <p>Like most people I encountered, Brown is a diehard Labour supporter, but not one particularly aware of antisemitic issues, including his own. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing against Jeremy Corbyn,\u201d he said, \u201cbut he got into bed with the wrong Jews.\u201d What did that mean? \u201cThe high rollers,\u201d he explained.</p> <p>Though sympathy for Berger was common, almost no one I spoke to had a good word to say about Hatton. Michael, a builder in a baseball cap, thought he was untrustworthy. He didn\u2019t know about his tweet, but he said: \u201cI work with Jews in the building business, and they\u2019re lovely people. Then, when you\u2019re in the pub with your friends, someone will talk about the Jews, the Rothschilds and all that.\u201d</p> <p>Not just in the pub. The chair of the Wavertree constituency Labour party (CLP) is Alex Scott-Samuel, a former academic at Liverpool University, who has appeared on a show broadcast by conspiracy theorist David Icke, claiming that: \u201cThe Rothschild family are behind a lot of the neoliberal influence in the UK and the US.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a93a1daa813bf4a5df12c161ff74cfeea2f41ddc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a93a1daa813bf4a5df12c161ff74cfeea2f41ddc/0_118_3688_2213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luciana Berger, MP for Liverpool Wavertree.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luciana Berger, MP for Liverpool Wavertree since 2010, after her resignation last Monday from Labour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Rothschild trope is a conspiracy theory popular among antisemites. The fact that Wavertree\u2019s chair was promoting it placed the CLP in the spotlight, causing its executive members to become tight-lipped around the media. But some days ago, the CLP defiantly broke its silence with a tweet detailing \u201cwhat the press won\u2019t tell you\u201d.</p> <p>Contrary to that claim, I can tell you that the tweet went on to say that Wavertree CLP had taken the following decisions: \u201c1. To condemn the dictatorship in Sudan and the Tory links to it. 2. To support the campaign to get the UK to commit to take 10,000 refugees. 3. To oppose the US-led coup attempt in Venezuela.\u201d</p> <p>No call, then, to reopen the post office.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are plenty of other Derek Hattons in Wavertree CLP but nothing seems to happen despite numerous complaints</p> <footer> <cite>Clare McIntyre, Labour councillor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clare McIntyre, one of Labour\u2019s three councillors in Wavertree, told me that she dreaded going to party meetings because she had been subjected to a campaign of harassment. Though an avowed socialist who has twice voted for Corbyn, she says she has fallen foul of the Momentum group which, according to her, has a stranglehold on the CLP executive.</p> <p>Her crime, she said, was to have supported Berger against antisemitic attacks \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve seen up close the sheer level of abuse and racism she\u2019s suffered\u201d \u2013 and to question why Corbyn wasn\u2019t doing more to tackle the issue.</p> <p>She has also been a vocal critic of Hatton, pointing to his proposal that rape victims should be named in court if their alleged attackers were found not guilty as a sign of deep-seated misogyny. She sees his attempted return as symbolic of a larger and more disturbing trend.</p> <p>\u201cThere are plenty of other Derek Hattons in the Wavertree constituency party but nothing seems to happen despite numerous complaints. I think Momentum in Liverpool is a mask for Militant. There are decent Momentum people and then there are the others who have their own agenda. \u2026 Militant haven\u2019t gone away. They\u2019re just the same people with bus passes now.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There's no antisemitism here. We're very cosmopolitan</p> <footer> <cite>Catherine, former teacher</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Off Wavertree\u2019s rundown high street is Sandown Lane, a beautiful tree-lined street with large Georgian houses that seem to inhabit a different universe to the main road just yards away. It\u2019s also home to the local party headquarters.</p> <p>\u201cNeedless to say,\u201d McIntyre told me, \u201cit\u2019s where most of the activists on the left live.\u201d</p> <p>Anne Maloney, a retired teacher who lives in one of the elegant houses, is not a party member, but she\u2019s a loyal Labour voter. What did she make of Berger as an MP? \u201cI wrote to her once,\u201d she told me.</p> <p>What about? \u201cPalestine. I firmly believe Israel is illegally occupying Palestinian territories. She wrote back saying she supported the Palestinian people. But I didn\u2019t think she was campaigning for the Palestinians. The problem is any criticism of Israel is always seen as antisemitism.\u201d</p> <p>Her neighbour, a woman in her 40s who didn\u2019t want to give her name, concurred. She said that she voted Green and had never agreed with Derek Hatton but, as a supporter of the Palestinians, she couldn\u2019t see what was wrong with his tweet. Had she read it? \u201cA summary of it, yes.\u201d</p> <p>The original wasn\u2019t long. It stated: \u201cJewish people with any sense of humanity need to start speaking out publicly against the ruthless murdering being carried out by Israel!\u201d</p> <p>Essentially, Hatton did what the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance defines as a concrete example of antisemitism: \u201cHolding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.\u201d</p> <p>His tweet rendered them guilty until proven innocent. If they didn\u2019t condemn Israel, they had no humanity. And what happens in history when we strip a minority of its humanity?</p> <p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d said the woman. \u201cPerhaps he went too far, but there are two sides to every story.\u201d</p> <p>Another former teacher, a few doors away, named Catherine, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no antisemitism in this lane. We\u2019re very cosmopolitan.\u201d</p> <p>Her words echoed the line that the Labour party, both in Wavertree and nationally, keeps restating, as accusations of antisemitism keep growing. Hatton\u2019s tweet serves as a kind of awareness test. Many Labour supporters in Wavertree, and across the country, insist that it\u2019s about Israel, completely blocking out the fact that it places all British Jews in the moral dock.</p> <p>It\u2019s been often said that Corbyn has to find a way of uniting the metropolitan middle class and the disaffected northern working-class Labour voters. In Wavertree, there are signs of an unholy alliance taking shape between those on the wrong end of austerity, who associate Jews with wealth and power, and bourgeois radicals who view Jews through the prism of Palestine.</p> <p>Not one person I spoke to would think of themselves as antisemitic, but perhaps it\u2019s the unreflective denial that is enabling antisemitism to thrive in the shade.</p>",

Over its Palladian entrance remains the original Latin motto, sub umbra floresco: \u201cI thrive in the shade.\u201d To judge by the area\u2019s recent political dramas, it\u2019s a phrase that hasn\u2019t gone out of fashion. Last week, the constituency\u2019s sitting MP, Luciana Berger, announced that she was quitting the Labour party to join the Independent Group. Among the reasons she gave for leaving was growing antisemitism within Labour. On the same day she departed, it was revealed that Derek Hatton, the controversial former deputy leader of Liverpool council and Militant Tendency member, had been readmitted to the party in the nearby Riverside constituency, whose Jewish MP, Louise Ellman, is under threat of deselection. But he was quickly suspended after a six-year-old antisemitic tweet came to light. The people of Wavertree had mixed feelings about these shady goings-on. At the Liverpool Cat Welfare shop, the owner, Jean Ellis, lamented the area\u2019s decline, saying the high street had never recovered from the closure of its post office. She was sad about Berger because she liked her. \u201cShe\u2019s very sincere. Very nice,\u201d she said. What did she think about the allegations of antisemitism? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, looking bemused. \u201cAll the wars are about religion.\u201d Stephen Brown, who supplements his pension by selling sausages to the local pubs, also said he was sad Berger was gone. \u201cShe didn\u2019t deserve to be treated that way,\u201d he said, adding as an unthinking afterthought, \u201ceven though she is Jewish.\u201d Like most people I encountered, Brown is a diehard Labour supporter, but not one particularly aware of antisemitic issues, including his own. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing against Jeremy Corbyn,\u201d he said, \u201cbut he got into bed with the wrong Jews.\u201d What did that mean? \u201cThe high rollers,\u201d he explained. Though sympathy for Berger was common, almost no one I spoke to had a good word to say about Hatton. Michael, a builder in a baseball cap, thought he was untrustworthy. He didn\u2019t know about his tweet, but he said: \u201cI work with Jews in the building business, and they\u2019re lovely people. Then, when you\u2019re in the pub with your friends, someone will talk about the Jews, the Rothschilds and all that.\u201d Not just in the pub. The chair of the Wavertree constituency Labour party (CLP) is Alex Scott-Samuel, a former academic at Liverpool University, who has appeared on a show broadcast by conspiracy theorist David Icke, claiming that: \u201cThe Rothschild family are behind a lot of the neoliberal influence in the UK and the US.\u201d The Rothschild trope is a conspiracy theory popular among antisemites. The fact that Wavertree\u2019s chair was promoting it placed the CLP in the spotlight, causing its executive members to become tight-lipped around the media. But some days ago, the CLP defiantly broke its silence with a tweet detailing \u201cwhat the press won\u2019t tell you\u201d. Contrary to that claim, I can tell you that the tweet went on to say that Wavertree CLP had taken the following decisions: \u201c1. To condemn the dictatorship in Sudan and the Tory links to it. 2. To support the campaign to get the UK to commit to take 10,000 refugees. 3. To oppose the US-led coup attempt in Venezuela.\u201d No call, then, to reopen the post office. Clare McIntyre, one of Labour\u2019s three councillors in Wavertree, told me that she dreaded going to party meetings because she had been subjected to a campaign of harassment. Though an avowed socialist who has twice voted for Corbyn, she says she has fallen foul of the Momentum group which, according to her, has a stranglehold on the CLP executive. Her crime, she said, was to have supported Berger against antisemitic attacks \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve seen up close the sheer level of abuse and racism she\u2019s suffered\u201d \u2013 and to question why Corbyn wasn\u2019t doing more to tackle the issue. She has also been a vocal critic of Hatton, pointing to his proposal that rape victims should be named in court if their alleged attackers were found not guilty as a sign of deep-seated misogyny. She sees his attempted return as symbolic of a larger and more disturbing trend. \u201cThere are plenty of other Derek Hattons in the Wavertree constituency party but nothing seems to happen despite numerous complaints. I think Momentum in Liverpool is a mask for Militant. There are decent Momentum people and then there are the others who have their own agenda. \u2026 Militant haven\u2019t gone away. They\u2019re just the same people with bus passes now.\u201d Off Wavertree\u2019s rundown high street is Sandown Lane, a beautiful tree-lined street with large Georgian houses that seem to inhabit a different universe to the main road just yards away. It\u2019s also home to the local party headquarters. \u201cNeedless to say,\u201d McIntyre told me, \u201cit\u2019s where most of the activists on the left live.\u201d Anne Maloney, a retired teacher who lives in one of the elegant houses, is not a party member, but she\u2019s a loyal Labour voter. What did she make of Berger as an MP? \u201cI wrote to her once,\u201d she told me. What about? \u201cPalestine. I firmly believe Israel is illegally occupying Palestinian territories. She wrote back saying she supported the Palestinian people. But I didn\u2019t think she was campaigning for the Palestinians. The problem is any criticism of Israel is always seen as antisemitism.\u201d Her neighbour, a woman in her 40s who didn\u2019t want to give her name, concurred. She said that she voted Green and had never agreed with Derek Hatton but, as a supporter of the Palestinians, she couldn\u2019t see what was wrong with his tweet. Had she read it? \u201cA summary of it, yes.\u201d The original wasn\u2019t long. It stated: \u201cJewish people with any sense of humanity need to start speaking out publicly against the ruthless murdering being carried out by Israel!\u201d Essentially, Hatton did what the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance defines as a concrete example of antisemitism: \u201cHolding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.\u201d His tweet rendered them guilty until proven innocent. If they didn\u2019t condemn Israel, they had no humanity. And what happens in history when we strip a minority of its humanity? \u201cWell, yes,\u201d said the woman. \u201cPerhaps he went too far, but there are two sides to every story.\u201d Another former teacher, a few doors away, named Catherine, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no antisemitism in this lane. We\u2019re very cosmopolitan.\u201d Her words echoed the line that the Labour party, both in Wavertree and nationally, keeps restating, as accusations of antisemitism keep growing. Hatton\u2019s tweet serves as a kind of awareness test. Many Labour supporters in Wavertree, and across the country, insist that it\u2019s about Israel, completely blocking out the fact that it places all British Jews in the moral dock. It\u2019s been often said that Corbyn has to find a way of uniting the metropolitan middle class and the disaffected northern working-class Labour voters. In Wavertree, there are signs of an unholy alliance taking shape between those on the wrong end of austerity, who associate Jews with wealth and power, and bourgeois radicals who view Jews through the prism of Palestine. Not one person I spoke to would think of themselves as antisemitic, but perhaps it\u2019s the unreflective denial that is enabling antisemitism to thrive in the shade.",

There is a never-ending supply of updates to the world of Harry Potter, generally of diminishing quality.</p> <p>Since the stage production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child opened in London in 2016, there have been two movies in the Fantastic Beasts movie franchise, with the promise of three more. JK Rowling, the author and creator of Harry Potter, who co-wrote the script for The Cursed Child, has offered a never-ending cycle of world-building titbits including the aforementioned information: that before the introduction of indoor plumbing wizards <a href=\"https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/01/ok-but-why-did-wizards-used-to-shit-themselves/\">just defecated where they stood and magicked the mess away</a>. Despite the love that much of the world bears for Harry Potter, you could be forgiven for wishing she would just stop.</p> <p>It is a relief, then, to discover that The Cursed Child, which opened in Melbourne on Saturday after several weeks of preview shows, is untainted by this excess of wizardly information.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/30/a-whole-new-controversy-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-comes-to-australia\">'A whole new controversy': Harry Potter and the Cursed Child comes to Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The posters adorning the Princess Theatre ask theatre-goers to keep the secrets, so we will. The script may have sold 4 million copies in its first week of sale in 2016, and it has enjoyed three sold-out seasons in London and one on Broadway, but the joy of theatre is that it is not a mass-distribution medium and some people have remained unspoiled.</p> <p>Besides, it\u2019s the plot, that same feature that kept readers staying awake all night to read the Harry Potter books the day of their release, that pulls the audience through what is by any measure an unreasonably long play. Parts one and two both run for almost three hours, and are viewed either on the same day or over consecutive nights. It is a binge-watching experience, down to the cliffhanger at the end of each act.</p> <p>The play opens on the first day of school for Harry Potter\u2019s second child, whom he named Albus Severus Potter after Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape, thus putting all the burden of the two most complex relationships of the teenage Harry\u2019s life on the one child. Unsurprisingly, Harry and Albus\u2019s relationship is a bit tense.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"907bd5c4eca14bb8c6e0ebcfe4a2f3593166850e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/907bd5c4eca14bb8c6e0ebcfe4a2f3593166850e/2765_0_2540_4480/567.jpg\" alt=\"Gareth Reeves as Harry Potter\" width=\"567\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Harry, who has always been fairly self-absorbed, is all the better for being a bit of a prick.

Harry, meanwhile, is forced to reconcile with his own unhealed trauma through the realisation that he is a bad parent.</p> <p>A warning to parents thinking of taking small children along: this does get scary in parts.</p> <p>Perhaps by virtue of being written by the playwright Jack Thorne, rather than Rowling herself, who provided plot notes but only wrote certain scenes, the play is able to point out flaws in the original series. Harry, who has always been fairly self-absorbed, is all the better for being a bit of a prick. Gareth Reeves is wonderful in the role, managing to be a thoroughly unlikable authoritarian at one moment and thoroughly ridiculous under the influence of polyjuice potion the next. It\u2019s Harry Potter for people who have never really liked Harry Potter.</p> <p>Speaking of polyjuice potion: let\u2019s talk about the magic, which achieves the difficult trick of making a crowd of cynical adults crane forward to see how it\u2019s done. The practical effects feel genuinely magical in a way that recaptures some of the wonder of reading the books as a child.

      "bodyText": "It is difficult to retain excitement for a franchise once you learn how its characters go to the bathroom. There is a never-ending supply of updates to the world of Harry Potter, generally of diminishing quality. Since the stage production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child opened in London in 2016, there have been two movies in the Fantastic Beasts movie franchise, with the promise of three more. JK Rowling, the author and creator of Harry Potter, who co-wrote the script for The Cursed Child, has offered a never-ending cycle of world-building titbits including the aforementioned information: that before the introduction of indoor plumbing wizards just defecated where they stood and magicked the mess away. Despite the love that much of the world bears for Harry Potter, you could be forgiven for wishing she would just stop. It is a relief, then, to discover that The Cursed Child, which opened in Melbourne on Saturday after several weeks of preview shows, is untainted by this excess of wizardly information. The posters adorning the Princess Theatre ask theatre-goers to keep the secrets, so we will. The script may have sold 4 million copies in its first week of sale in 2016, and it has enjoyed three sold-out seasons in London and one on Broadway, but the joy of theatre is that it is not a mass-distribution medium and some people have remained unspoiled. Besides, it\u2019s the plot, that same feature that kept readers staying awake all night to read the Harry Potter books the day of their release, that pulls the audience through what is by any measure an unreasonably long play. Parts one and two both run for almost three hours, and are viewed either on the same day or over consecutive nights. It is a binge-watching experience, down to the cliffhanger at the end of each act. The play opens on the first day of school for Harry Potter\u2019s second child, whom he named Albus Severus Potter after Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape, thus putting all the burden of the two most complex relationships of the teenage Harry\u2019s life on the one child. Unsurprisingly, Harry and Albus\u2019s relationship is a bit tense. On the Hogwarts Express, Albus meets Scorpius Malfoy, son of Draco, and they embark on a journey forged by the same foundation of close friendship, adventure, life-threatening engagement with evil forces and smattering of childhood trauma that shaped the original books. Harry, meanwhile, is forced to reconcile with his own unhealed trauma through the realisation that he is a bad parent. A warning to parents thinking of taking small children along: this does get scary in parts. Perhaps by virtue of being written by the playwright Jack Thorne, rather than Rowling herself, who provided plot notes but only wrote certain scenes, the play is able to point out flaws in the original series. Harry, who has always been fairly self-absorbed, is all the better for being a bit of a prick. Gareth Reeves is wonderful in the role, managing to be a thoroughly unlikable authoritarian at one moment and thoroughly ridiculous under the influence of polyjuice potion the next. It\u2019s Harry Potter for people who have never really liked Harry Potter. Speaking of polyjuice potion: let\u2019s talk about the magic, which achieves the difficult trick of making a crowd of cynical adults crane forward to see how it\u2019s done. The practical effects feel genuinely magical in a way that recaptures some of the wonder of reading the books as a child. Characters disappear and reappear, chairs float, otherwise dignified adults come shooting out of fireplaces and time and space are rewritten, all to gasps of delight from the audience. It is no surprise that lighting, set design and costume were among the six Tony awards the Broadway production won last year. The magical interludes also offer a point of comparison with the London production, using different tricks to transition between scenes. Another change is the decision to lean into the allegory of the centaurs as an indigenous people whose culture is diminished by the dominant race, in the portrayal of Bane, played by the Samoan-Australian actor Iopu Auva\u2019a. The Australian cast, headed by Reeves, includes Paula Arundell as Hermione Granger, Gynton Grantley as Ron Weasley, Sean Rees-Wemyss as Albus and the excellent William McKenna, who makes his professional theatre debut as your new favourite character, Scorpius Malfoy. The director, John Tiffany, told Guardian Australia last year that this was \u201ca love story between Scorpius and Albus \u2026 but that does not mean it\u2019s sexual\u201d \u2013 because doing so would mean the relationship \u201cwould become the story\u201d. This was certainly true when the play debuted in 2016, but piled on other criticisms of the way gay relationships in Wizarding World properties have been handled, it has the appearance of a concerning trend. Despite those concerns the friendship between Albus and Scorpius, and the different ways their families respond to it, is the most charming and compelling part of this new narrative. Their friendship is a shining bright spot in what becomes an increasingly dark story. And light in the darkness is what Harry Potter has always been about. \u2022 Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is playing at the Princess Theatre in Melbourne. Tickets can be purchased here",

      "bodyText": "Paul Manafort is a hardened criminal who \u201crepeatedly and brazenly\u201d broke the law even while serving as Donald Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, special counsel Robert Mueller has said. Mueller\u2019s team said in a new court filing in Washington DC that Manafort deserved a second prison sentence, which could total 10 years, reflecting the seriousness of his crimes. The prosecutors also said they may ask for that sentence to begin only after Manafort, 69, completes a sentence of up to 24 years for separate convictions in Virginia. Manafort has shown a \u201chardened adherence to committing crimes and lack of remorse\u201d, they wrote in a sentencing memo released on Saturday afternoon. Mueller\u2019s team did not, however, provide new details on Manafort\u2019s interactions with an alleged Russian intelligence operative, or make any new allegations tying Manafort to Russia\u2019s election interference. Manafort chaired Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential election campaign. He has been in jail since June last year after being caught witness tampering while on bail awaiting trial. Saturday\u2019s filing is related to Manafort\u2019s upcoming sentencing for two counts of criminal conspiracy he admitted to last September. Mueller\u2019s team said last week Manafort faced 19 to 24 years in prison for separate fraud convictions in Virginia. Manafort\u2019s admission of the conspiracy charges in Washington secured him a plea deal that Mueller scrapped after Manafort continued lying. The violation of the deal freed Mueller\u2019s team from obligations to recommend a lenient sentence. Mueller is investigating whether there were any links or coordination between Trump\u2019s team and Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 US election, which US intelligence agencies concluded was aimed at helping Trump. Investigators have homed in on Manafort\u2019s interactions in 2016 with Konstantin Kilimnik, a former colleague and an alleged Russian intelligence operative. Kilimnik denies involvement with Russian intelligence. William Barr, the new US attorney general, is expecting to receive a report from Mueller in the coming weeks that would signal the end of the special counsel\u2019s investigation, according to several media reports. The filing released on Saturday recapped the conspiracies to which Manafort pleaded guilty in Washington. They spanned several crimes including money laundering, tax fraud and failing to register as an agent of Ukraine in the US. Manafort also confessed to conspiring with Kilimnik to obstruct justice. Early last year, the pair contacted former lobbying colleagues who were likely witnesses in Manafort\u2019s case and urged them to give false testimony. Mueller\u2019s team said that for almost a decade Manafort used \u201cdeceptive tactics\u201d to run a multi-million dollar lobbying campaign in Washington for Ukraine\u2019s former pro-Russian administration, without registering in the US as a foreign agent. The veteran Republican operative knew he was legally required to register, the prosecutors said, because he ran into trouble for the same activity when working for Saudi Arabia during Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency. Manafort\u2019s criminality \u201cremarkably went unabated even after indictment\u201d, Mueller\u2019s team said in the Saturday filing. He conspired to witness tamper with Kilimnik while out on bail and then committed perjury even after signing his plea deal. Judge Amy Berman Jackson this month agreed with Mueller that Manafort continued lying about three disputed issues: his interactions with Kilimnik, a payment he took from a pro-Trump campaign group and another justice department investigation that has not been identified. Manafort entered his guilty pleas last year shortly before he was due to go on trial a second time. He acted after the jury in Virginia found him guilty in August on eight financial crimes largely committed during the time of his work in eastern Europe. Jurors could not reach a verdict on 10 other charges. Manafort was found to have hidden more than $16m of earnings from US authorities, allowing him to avoid paying $6m in taxes. He also hid tens of millions of dollars in foreign bank accounts and secured $25m in bank loans through fraud. Several other former Trump advisers have been convicted of crimes as a result of Mueller\u2019s investigation. None of the convictions are related to Russia\u2019s interference in the election. More than two dozen Russians have been charged for their roles in the operation, which included stealing and leaking emails from senior Democrats and mounting an online disinformation campaign to disrupt the election.",

But I\u2019ve despaired as Labour has turned inwards and to the fringes, towards internal debates and wrangles, more interested in the machine, tribal politics of the past than changing the country for a better future.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/23/corbyn-told-change-course-before-its-too-late-for-labour-michael-savage\">Corbyn told: change course before it\u2019s too late for Labour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since leaving the Labour party last week I have been struck by the huge outpouring of support and good wishes from people locally and nationally. There is a real appetite for change in our broken system. People are sick of the false choice between the established political parties who take voters for granted. People tell me it is time for something fresh, unfettered by the old 20th-century ways of doing things.</p> <p>There\u2019s also something more fundamental that people want, and that\u2019s a change of political culture. Our politics in recent years has been devalued by the style, tone and language of its protagonists. During the Scottish referendum, the EU referendum, and since Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the Labour party three years ago, a harshness, a shrillness, and a viciousness has become normal within our public discourse. This is not the same as robust debate and interrogation of ideas, which we all should welcome. Instead it\u2019s a culture of abuse, name-calling and vitriol which has become the norm.</p> <p>Some blame social media, but talking to friends on Merseyside who remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jul/16/militant-derek-hatton-labour-party-1991\" title=\"\">Derek Hatton\u2019s Militant</a> in the 1980s, there is nothing new about this style of politics. It is born of machismo and arrogance, of ideological certainties, and a tribal conviction that anyone with a different view or perspective is a deadly enemy. Whereas once it existed only on the fringes of left or right, it now surfaces in the mainstream, and is given the soapbox and megaphone of social media. It is pure poison.</p> <p>Inside my former party, this corrosive culture found expression through the rise in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/antisemitism\" title=\"\">antisemitism</a>. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/22/labour-mp-ian-austin-quits-the-party\" title=\"\">Ian Austin</a> MP said on Friday, the party leadership is harder on those who complain about racism than those who perpetrate it. One of the worst offenders was only recently re-elected to the national executive. It is also manifest in the misogynist attacks on female MPs and activists, and in the atrocious name-calling of anyone who fails to submit.</p> <p>This nasty culture is just one of the reasons Labour MPs are leaving the party. I blamed (among a number of things) the \u201cbullying, bigotry and intimidation\u201d<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/18/in-their-own-words-why-seven-mps-are-quitting-labour-independent-group\" title=\"\"> in my statement on Monday</a>. Each MP that leaves is subject to the vilest of attacks, slurs, character assassinations and accusations of treachery and betrayal, which only serve to make our argument for us. The worst of the abuse comes from those with #JC4PM19 hashtags, and the Labour leadership does nothing to discourage them. No wonder Tom Watson said he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/18/chuka-umunna-and-other-mps-set-to-quit-labour-party\" title=\"\">no longer recognises</a> the current Labour party.</p> <p>As the Independent Group, we are determined to try to forge a different style of doing politics. Our founding statement calls for a culture where every member has the right to be heard and the duty to lead. We commit to support each other and treat each other with respect \u2013 an approach which can be scaled up to a larger group, as and when people may join us. Culture is a reflection of values. Our values are solidarity, tolerance, openness, honesty, courage and intellectual curiosity. But values are useless unless they are lived. If we can\u2019t behave and speak in tune with our values, then they aren\u2019t really our values.</p> <p>These are early days and forging a new political culture will not be easy. But it\u2019s what my constituents and the country deserve and I\u2019m certainly going to give it my best shot</p> <p><em>Luciana Berger is the MP for Liverpool Wavertree and a co-founder of the Independent Group</em></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>This new grouping is the real barrier to change ...

At 16, out of school and pregnant, my own life could have been written off. It was the help I had from some of the then Labour government\u2019s policies such as Sure Start that turned it around.</p> <p>So it is desperately sad for me that the people I grew up with in Stockport no longer have a Labour MP, following the resignation of Ann Coffey. It is even more so because right now they need another Labour government more than ever.</p> <p>Labour put forward a manifesto in 2017, which won over millions of new voters, including a majority in Stockport, with a programme of policies that would transform our country.</p> <p>So it was bizarre to hear Chris Leslie, one of the self-appointed leaders of the so-called Independent Group, say last week that Labour wanted \u201cto keep everything exactly as it is\u201d. They must be living in a different country to the rest of us.</p> <p>I cannot be clearer about this. I am not in politics, let alone Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet, to keep things as they are. The transformation that the Labour party today can make to our country is even more fundamental than that which the last Labour government made to my own life and so many others. And far from leaving the centre ground, we are occupying it.</p> <p>More than three-quarters of the public back our plans to run our public services so they work for people, not shareholders. The British people overwhelmingly favour big businesses and the wealthiest individuals contributing their fair share so we can invest in our schools, hospitals and services. Two-thirds agree that austerity has gone too far.</p> <p>Our policies captured the public imagination. I am sorry we didn\u2019t win the election, and I will do everything in my power to bring Labour in to office, because every day we do not succeed is a day when we let down those who need us most. But we won millions more votes because investment trumped austerity, public ownership trumped privatisation, and hope trumped fear.</p> <p>Our economic and political system is broken and this is no time for tinkering around the edges. Far from wealth trickling down, nine years of terrible Tory rule have dramatically worsened the lives of the least well-off. A fifth of the population \u2013 14 million people \u2013 are living in poverty and welfare cuts have hurt millions of families. Only days ago we were warned that child poverty could rise to a record high in a matter of years.</p> <p>About 20% of Britain\u2019s wealth lies is in the hands of just 1%. Oxfam found that the poorest 10% of people pay a higher rate of tax than the richest 10%. For the first time since 1945, life expectancy is actually going down in the poorer parts of the country.</p> <p>So we cannot and will not \u201ckeep everything as it is\u201d. My fear is the opposite: this new grouping is now the real barrier to change.</p> <p>From what we have seen and heard so far, all that we know is that they would continue Tory policies from endless privatisation to sky-high tuition fees. They defend austerity and don\u2019t want to ask the richest to pay a little more in tax. They could hand the Tories victory at an election and may even prop up the Tory government in parliament.</p> <p>To put it simply, it is they who would keep everything as it is. It is the Labour party that is the real movement for change. I urge anyone who shares that goal to join us and fight for it.</p> <p><em>Angela Rayner is shadow education secretary.</em></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Opposition to Jeremy Corbyn's leadership is a matter of principle as well as necessity</p> <footer> <cite>Roy Hattersley</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c5cdfe4c5116a1aeeba06dc5356f74110564342e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5cdfe4c5116a1aeeba06dc5356f74110564342e/708_652_2707_2706/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roy Hattersley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roy Hattersley</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pako Mera/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Labour party, despite claims that its membership exceeds 500,000, is withering away. Day by day it loses credibility. Last week\u2019s defections were no more than a spectacular manifestation of the growing belief that Labour cannot be saved \u2013 and is not worth saving.</p> <p>The prophets of doom are wrong. But survival as an effective political force requires Labour\u2019s genuine social democrats to demonstrate now that they are still a power within the party. That is only possible if they have the courage to admit why so many people, once natural Labour voters, have drifted away.</p> <p>The millstone around Labour\u2019s neck is the party leader. Jeremy Corbyn has supported so many squalid causes and defended so many disreputable regimes that opposition to his leadership is (or should be) a matter of principle as well as political necessity.</p> <p>Leaving Labour would be the most traumatic experience of my life. But I can only remain a member with a good conscience for as long as I make clear that the man who defended the exhibition of the antisemite mural and attended the wreath-laying ceremony which paid homage to the Black September terrorists does not, and never could, speak for me. Innumerable other Labour party members feel the same. The party\u2019s future depends on them saying so.</p> <p>Yet all we have recently heard from \u201cmoderates\u201d in the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) is complaints about their ill treatment. Politics is a tough business and the proper response to assaults and abuse from the wilder shores of socialism is neither surrender nor retreat. It is a determination to take the ideological battle into enemy territory.</p> <p>The failure to fight back made the misused moderates culprits as well as victims. They have much to learn from the untiring campaigning of the far left. Last year a Corbynite MP toured the country, urging local Labour parties \u2013 with which he had no connection \u2013 to subject their MPs to the full rigours of re-selection. Why did no one follow him from constituency to constituency explaining that mandatory reselection is a device by which mainstream MPs are forced to support the extremist agenda or be evicted? Reasonable people do not want to spend every night in political meetings. So the reasonable argument is lost by default.</p> <p>Two years before Neil Kinnock killed off the Trotskyite infiltration of the Labour party, some of us prepared the way by arguing, in the constituencies, the case for the militants\u2019 expulsion. We challenged, head on, the doctrine that Labour has no enemies on the left and argued that a political party has a duty, as well as the right, to define and defend its ideological frontiers.</p> <p>Corbyn has surrounded himself with recent supporters of political movements which no genuine democrat could possibly endorse. And moderate Labour MPs meekly accept their authority as the price which must be paid for a quiet life.</p> <p>The time has come for genuine social democrats in the party to say that the only political authority they accept is a combination of conscience and conviction. Tom Watson has pointed the way. Moderates must band together in a distinct group with distinct policies, hold regular meetings and become the real Labour party-in-waiting.</p> <p>Corbynites will shout \u201ctreason\u201d but the broad church, which the party leader defends with such passion, stretches both ways. And the haemorrhage of one-time Labour supporters would at least slow down when it was clear that the party of Attlee, Gaitskell and Wilson is not dead, but sleeping.</p> <p>Leaving the party, as nine MPs did last week, was an admission that the battle to resuscitate democratic socialism was too dangerous and difficult for them to fight. But unconditional surrender takes a variety of forms.</p> <p>Choosing a quiet life on the backbenches while the Labour party drifts into oblivion, is \u2013 in its way \u2013 just another form of capitulation. It is almost 60 years since Hugh Gaitskell swore to \u201cfight, fight and fight again\u201d to save the party.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s survival as a potential government depends on an army of democratic socialists promising the same \u2013 and meaning it.</p> <p><em>Roy Hattersley was deputy Labour leader from 1983-1992.</em></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>We failed to keep those nine MPs with us.

Always have been. I was raised singing songs about putting Tories on a bonfires and being told that even saying \u201cMaggie Thatcher\u201d was swearing. My parents would have been deeply disappointed if I had married a Tory.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t all cynicism and vitriol. I was also raised with stories of solidarity. Soulful yarns about striking workers fighting for better pay, and tales of the unexpected where the little man won out thanks to the Labour party and the union. If you cut me my blood is made up of one part Birmingham, one part Labour party.</p> <p>I\u2019m a tribeswoman without doubt. And yet I find myself questioning the very nature of tribalism more and more. I have never liked the idea of the MP who sits on a massive majority, knowing they are secure. I don\u2019t like the rot that can set in when one group of people is a shoo-in for a particular political party and without question this type of person will always vote one way.</p> <p>I think the ordinary citizen is not served well by safe seats or a politics that takes their votes for granted.</p> <p>The 2017 election saw most voters split down the middle, and again go back to the politics of the two main parties. People were voting as much for what they didn\u2019t want as what they did. I should be dancing around because I have a bigger majority, a safer seat, an easier ride. But I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t want to look a gift horse in the mouth but I do want to earn the votes I get. Hey \u2013 perhaps all that conditioning in childhood about never benefiting from unearned income worked.</p> <p>While all over the world division and vitriol is blasting across our airwaves, I still think, from my experiences as a local MP and an ordinary citizen, that this is not an accurate portrayal, and that people desperately want reasonable, pragmatic solutions to the problems in their lives. I think they are sick of the tribal squabble and want us talk to them and about them. So, yes, I am sad that my colleagues have left our party. I am even sadder that some were bullied out by antisemites that have not been kept in check. But I don\u2019t think I am sad that this breakaway has happened.</p> <p>I think politics needed a kick up the bum, with both main parties seeking to feed red meat to their bases above serving the country. Both have engaged appallingly in a squabble for the heart of the party and forgotten that the average person doesn\u2019t give a toss.</p> <p>I don\u2019t buy the argument that the new breakaway group are handing the Tories a victory over the Labour party because they will split the vote.

      "bodyText": "Since 2010 I\u2019ve watched my area be drained of resources and hope by this rightwing Conservative government. They\u2019ve cut police officers, firefighters, NHS services and our school budgets, and put deprivation, poverty and malnutrition back on to our streets. People are desperate for a real alternative. But I\u2019ve despaired as Labour has turned inwards and to the fringes, towards internal debates and wrangles, more interested in the machine, tribal politics of the past than changing the country for a better future. Since leaving the Labour party last week I have been struck by the huge outpouring of support and good wishes from people locally and nationally. There is a real appetite for change in our broken system. People are sick of the false choice between the established political parties who take voters for granted. People tell me it is time for something fresh, unfettered by the old 20th-century ways of doing things. There\u2019s also something more fundamental that people want, and that\u2019s a change of political culture. Our politics in recent years has been devalued by the style, tone and language of its protagonists. During the Scottish referendum, the EU referendum, and since Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the Labour party three years ago, a harshness, a shrillness, and a viciousness has become normal within our public discourse. This is not the same as robust debate and interrogation of ideas, which we all should welcome. Instead it\u2019s a culture of abuse, name-calling and vitriol which has become the norm. Some blame social media, but talking to friends on Merseyside who remember Derek Hatton\u2019s Militant in the 1980s, there is nothing new about this style of politics. It is born of machismo and arrogance, of ideological certainties, and a tribal conviction that anyone with a different view or perspective is a deadly enemy. Whereas once it existed only on the fringes of left or right, it now surfaces in the mainstream, and is given the soapbox and megaphone of social media. It is pure poison. Inside my former party, this corrosive culture found expression through the rise in antisemitism. As Ian Austin MP said on Friday, the party leadership is harder on those who complain about racism than those who perpetrate it. One of the worst offenders was only recently re-elected to the national executive. It is also manifest in the misogynist attacks on female MPs and activists, and in the atrocious name-calling of anyone who fails to submit. This nasty culture is just one of the reasons Labour MPs are leaving the party. I blamed (among a number of things) the \u201cbullying, bigotry and intimidation\u201d in my statement on Monday. Each MP that leaves is subject to the vilest of attacks, slurs, character assassinations and accusations of treachery and betrayal, which only serve to make our argument for us. The worst of the abuse comes from those with #JC4PM19 hashtags, and the Labour leadership does nothing to discourage them. No wonder Tom Watson said he no longer recognises the current Labour party. As the Independent Group, we are determined to try to forge a different style of doing politics. Our founding statement calls for a culture where every member has the right to be heard and the duty to lead. We commit to support each other and treat each other with respect \u2013 an approach which can be scaled up to a larger group, as and when people may join us. Culture is a reflection of values. Our values are solidarity, tolerance, openness, honesty, courage and intellectual curiosity. But values are useless unless they are lived. If we can\u2019t behave and speak in tune with our values, then they aren\u2019t really our values. These are early days and forging a new political culture will not be easy. But it\u2019s what my constituents and the country deserve and I\u2019m certainly going to give it my best shot Luciana Berger is the MP for Liverpool Wavertree and a co-founder of the Independent Group I first learned the power of a Labour government to transform lives growing up in my hometown of Stockport. At 16, out of school and pregnant, my own life could have been written off. It was the help I had from some of the then Labour government\u2019s policies such as Sure Start that turned it around. So it is desperately sad for me that the people I grew up with in Stockport no longer have a Labour MP, following the resignation of Ann Coffey. It is even more so because right now they need another Labour government more than ever. Labour put forward a manifesto in 2017, which won over millions of new voters, including a majority in Stockport, with a programme of policies that would transform our country. So it was bizarre to hear Chris Leslie, one of the self-appointed leaders of the so-called Independent Group, say last week that Labour wanted \u201cto keep everything exactly as it is\u201d. They must be living in a different country to the rest of us. I cannot be clearer about this. I am not in politics, let alone Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet, to keep things as they are. The transformation that the Labour party today can make to our country is even more fundamental than that which the last Labour government made to my own life and so many others. And far from leaving the centre ground, we are occupying it. More than three-quarters of the public back our plans to run our public services so they work for people, not shareholders. The British people overwhelmingly favour big businesses and the wealthiest individuals contributing their fair share so we can invest in our schools, hospitals and services. Two-thirds agree that austerity has gone too far. Our policies captured the public imagination. I am sorry we didn\u2019t win the election, and I will do everything in my power to bring Labour in to office, because every day we do not succeed is a day when we let down those who need us most. But we won millions more votes because investment trumped austerity, public ownership trumped privatisation, and hope trumped fear. Our economic and political system is broken and this is no time for tinkering around the edges. Far from wealth trickling down, nine years of terrible Tory rule have dramatically worsened the lives of the least well-off. A fifth of the population \u2013 14 million people \u2013 are living in poverty and welfare cuts have hurt millions of families. Only days ago we were warned that child poverty could rise to a record high in a matter of years. About 20% of Britain\u2019s wealth lies is in the hands of just 1%. Oxfam found that the poorest 10% of people pay a higher rate of tax than the richest 10%. For the first time since 1945, life expectancy is actually going down in the poorer parts of the country. So we cannot and will not \u201ckeep everything as it is\u201d. My fear is the opposite: this new grouping is now the real barrier to change. From what we have seen and heard so far, all that we know is that they would continue Tory policies from endless privatisation to sky-high tuition fees. They defend austerity and don\u2019t want to ask the richest to pay a little more in tax. They could hand the Tories victory at an election and may even prop up the Tory government in parliament. To put it simply, it is they who would keep everything as it is. It is the Labour party that is the real movement for change. I urge anyone who shares that goal to join us and fight for it. Angela Rayner is shadow education secretary. The Labour party, despite claims that its membership exceeds 500,000, is withering away. Day by day it loses credibility. Last week\u2019s defections were no more than a spectacular manifestation of the growing belief that Labour cannot be saved \u2013 and is not worth saving. The prophets of doom are wrong. But survival as an effective political force requires Labour\u2019s genuine social democrats to demonstrate now that they are still a power within the party. That is only possible if they have the courage to admit why so many people, once natural Labour voters, have drifted away. The millstone around Labour\u2019s neck is the party leader. Jeremy Corbyn has supported so many squalid causes and defended so many disreputable regimes that opposition to his leadership is (or should be) a matter of principle as well as political necessity. Leaving Labour would be the most traumatic experience of my life. But I can only remain a member with a good conscience for as long as I make clear that the man who defended the exhibition of the antisemite mural and attended the wreath-laying ceremony which paid homage to the Black September terrorists does not, and never could, speak for me. Innumerable other Labour party members feel the same. The party\u2019s future depends on them saying so. Yet all we have recently heard from \u201cmoderates\u201d in the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) is complaints about their ill treatment. Politics is a tough business and the proper response to assaults and abuse from the wilder shores of socialism is neither surrender nor retreat. It is a determination to take the ideological battle into enemy territory. The failure to fight back made the misused moderates culprits as well as victims. They have much to learn from the untiring campaigning of the far left. Last year a Corbynite MP toured the country, urging local Labour parties \u2013 with which he had no connection \u2013 to subject their MPs to the full rigours of re-selection. Why did no one follow him from constituency to constituency explaining that mandatory reselection is a device by which mainstream MPs are forced to support the extremist agenda or be evicted? Reasonable people do not want to spend every night in political meetings. So the reasonable argument is lost by default. Two years before Neil Kinnock killed off the Trotskyite infiltration of the Labour party, some of us prepared the way by arguing, in the constituencies, the case for the militants\u2019 expulsion. We challenged, head on, the doctrine that Labour has no enemies on the left and argued that a political party has a duty, as well as the right, to define and defend its ideological frontiers. Corbyn has surrounded himself with recent supporters of political movements which no genuine democrat could possibly endorse. And moderate Labour MPs meekly accept their authority as the price which must be paid for a quiet life. The time has come for genuine social democrats in the party to say that the only political authority they accept is a combination of conscience and conviction. Tom Watson has pointed the way. Moderates must band together in a distinct group with distinct policies, hold regular meetings and become the real Labour party-in-waiting. Corbynites will shout \u201ctreason\u201d but the broad church, which the party leader defends with such passion, stretches both ways. And the haemorrhage of one-time Labour supporters would at least slow down when it was clear that the party of Attlee, Gaitskell and Wilson is not dead, but sleeping. Leaving the party, as nine MPs did last week, was an admission that the battle to resuscitate democratic socialism was too dangerous and difficult for them to fight. But unconditional surrender takes a variety of forms. Choosing a quiet life on the backbenches while the Labour party drifts into oblivion, is \u2013 in its way \u2013 just another form of capitulation. It is almost 60 years since Hugh Gaitskell swore to \u201cfight, fight and fight again\u201d to save the party. Labour\u2019s survival as a potential government depends on an army of democratic socialists promising the same \u2013 and meaning it. Roy Hattersley was deputy Labour leader from 1983-1992. I\u2019m a tribal sort. Always have been. I was raised singing songs about putting Tories on a bonfires and being told that even saying \u201cMaggie Thatcher\u201d was swearing. My parents would have been deeply disappointed if I had married a Tory. It wasn\u2019t all cynicism and vitriol. I was also raised with stories of solidarity. Soulful yarns about striking workers fighting for better pay, and tales of the unexpected where the little man won out thanks to the Labour party and the union. If you cut me my blood is made up of one part Birmingham, one part Labour party. I\u2019m a tribeswoman without doubt. And yet I find myself questioning the very nature of tribalism more and more. I have never liked the idea of the MP who sits on a massive majority, knowing they are secure. I don\u2019t like the rot that can set in when one group of people is a shoo-in for a particular political party and without question this type of person will always vote one way. I think the ordinary citizen is not served well by safe seats or a politics that takes their votes for granted. The 2017 election saw most voters split down the middle, and again go back to the politics of the two main parties. People were voting as much for what they didn\u2019t want as what they did. I should be dancing around because I have a bigger majority, a safer seat, an easier ride. But I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t want to look a gift horse in the mouth but I do want to earn the votes I get. Hey \u2013 perhaps all that conditioning in childhood about never benefiting from unearned income worked. While all over the world division and vitriol is blasting across our airwaves, I still think, from my experiences as a local MP and an ordinary citizen, that this is not an accurate portrayal, and that people desperately want reasonable, pragmatic solutions to the problems in their lives. I think they are sick of the tribal squabble and want us talk to them and about them. So, yes, I am sad that my colleagues have left our party. I am even sadder that some were bullied out by antisemites that have not been kept in check. But I don\u2019t think I am sad that this breakaway has happened. I think politics needed a kick up the bum, with both main parties seeking to feed red meat to their bases above serving the country. Both have engaged appallingly in a squabble for the heart of the party and forgotten that the average person doesn\u2019t give a toss. I don\u2019t buy the argument that the new breakaway group are handing the Tories a victory over the Labour party because they will split the vote. I think we in the Labour party should try to win every vote we receive by being better than the others. We will not do that if we don\u2019t tackle the antisemitism in our ranks, or if we continue to obsessively fight with one other. Every one of us needs to back down. Me included. If we \u2013 with all our history, our folk tales, our heart \u2013 can\u2019t set out a vision that would win an election, then that is on us.

      "bodyText": "Almost 60% of voters support the recently passed medevac bill to more easily get critically ill people access to medical care, a new poll has revealed. The poll, conducted on Thursday, also found majority support in the electorates of both Peter Dutton and Tony Abbott, and overwhelming support among undecided voters. The polling was done by uComms for GetUp, and asked 1,796 voters their thoughts on the bill and how it would affect their vote in the federal election. Overall 40.3% said they strongly supported, 19.4% supported the passing of the bill and 3.4% had not decided. Support was higher among women and older people. Across party lines the bill had the support of 90.4% of Labor voters and 94.2% of Greens voters, and just over a quarter of Coalition voters. One Nation voters and those aged 18 to 34 most strongly opposed the bill. The bill, which is yet to become law, ensures that any person on Manus Island or Nauru who was sent there under Australia\u2019s offshore processing regime and who needs medical attention in Australia can be transferred on the recommendation of two doctors. If the minister seeks to refuse the transfer on medical grounds, the recommendation must be assessed by an independent panel within 72 hours, but the minister can still refuse a transfer on security grounds. Participants were also asked: \u201cIf a refugee is ill in an Australian-run offshore detention camp, do you agree or disagree that doctors should be able to transfer them to Australia for medical treatment?\u201d It received similar support across the demographics, including 59.6% of people aged over 51. GetUp\u2019s human rights director, Shen Narayanasamy, said the government\u2019s rhetoric onthe bill was a push for a \u201cTampa 2\u201d, but one which was failing to draw votes. \u201cTony Abbott and Peter Dutton\u2019s slogans and scare campaigns are turning off voters, and a huge number of previously Liberal voters are seeking a more humane approach to border security,\u201d she said. \u201cThe political orthodoxy that humanity towards people seeking asylum is electorally unpopular is complete bunk and politicians spruiking it are out of touch with the national electorate, and likely to be tossed out in seats across the country.\u201d The poll also spoke directly to people in the Warringah electorate of former prime minister, Abbott, and the Dickson electorate of current home affairs minister, Peter Dutton. Both are hardline opponents of the bill and are for tough measures deterring asylum seekers from travelling to Australia by boat, including the continuation of offshore processing. In Warringah 57.3% of voters supported the bill, again with higher support among women and older people. It found 83.8% of people who supported the high-profile independent challenger for the seat, Zali Steggall, also supported the bill. Only 17.5% of Liberal voters in Warringah supported it but more than 23% said they would be more likely to vote for someone who \u201cstruck a balance between strong borders and humane treatment for people in offshore detention\u201d. The poll also questioned people\u2019s voting intention \u201cif a federal election was to be held today\u201d, finding Abbott would lose to Steggall on two-party-preferred votes, 43-57. Abbott\u2019s highest support was among older constituents, the same demographic who supported the medevac bill in higher proportions. Among the small proportion of undecideds, the largest proportion had a \u201cslight leaning towards Abbott, but 86.8% said they would preference Steggall higher. In Dickson, Dutton\u2019s predicted results were similarly negative, where Labor challenger Ali France took 52% of the two-party-preferred vote. Although he had slightly more support in decrying the medevac bill, more than half of his constituents \u2013 52.9% \u2013 supported it. The bill\u2019s passing last week represented a historic defeat for the Coalition government, and was quickly followed by an escalation in partisan rhetoric. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced Christmas Island detention centre would be reopened at a cost of more than $1bn as a result, and accused Labor of weakening Australia\u2019s borders. In Senate estimates it was revealed that the government\u2019s policy for the new law was that sick people would be brought to Christmas Island first and then to the mainland if needed. Christmas Island\u2019s local council has said it does not have facilities for complex treatment, or even childbirth. No baby has beem born on the island in 20 years. Independents and Greens accused the government of subverting democracy and denying the parliament\u2019s intent in passing the bill. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said he had no problem with people being sent to Christmas Island first: \u201cIf the medical treatment is delivered \u2026 on Christmas Island and it makes people well, that\u2019s fine.\u201d",

Ukip records 7% support. The Labour leadership is attempting to stem the crisis by promising to review its handling of antisemitism complaints after Luciana Berger quit, following vehement abuse. The leadership is also poised to back a plan by Labour backbenchers Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, which would see Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal voted through on the condition that it is put to a public vote. Watson and others see it as a way of uniting the party once Labour\u2019s preferred Brexit deal has been blocked. The pressure on Corbyn to back a second referendum was increasing on Saturday night, as Tim Roache, general secretary of the Labour-affiliated GMB union, backed the Kyle-Wilson plan. \u201cThe clock is ticking and something needs to break the logjam in Westminster,\u201d Roache said. \u201cThe prime minister refuses to budge, there is no genuine attempt to get consensus, and no deal would be an absolute economic disaster, so this needs to go back to the public. \u201cThe people must be the ones to decide whether Theresa May\u2019s version of Brexit beats the deal we already have with Europe. If the prime minister is confident that her deal does the job, she doesn\u2019t have anything to worry about.\u201d In an online article for the Observer, Khan said that the last week had been \u201cthe most distressing and depressing of my 33 years in the party\u201d, and that urgent action was needed to keep Labour together. \u201cIt is our responsibility to ensure that the Labour party emerges from these uncertain times ready to govern and able to attract those Members of Parliament who have left to return home,\u201d he writes. \u201cOver the last few years, it\u2019s clear that Labour has been too slow at addressing the Jewish community\u2019s concerns and at kicking out the minority of Labour members and supporters who think it is acceptable to use antisemitic tropes and abuse \u2013 both online and in local Labour meetings. This has led to a collapse in trust between Labour and the Jewish community.\u201d His intervention comes as Garrard, who had donated about \u00a31.5m to Labour since 2003, told the Observer that he had already started funding TIG. \u201cI have watched, with ever-growing concern, the deterioration, especially over the past year, of the extent and nature of the naked antisemitism which has increased throughout the Labour party and its supporters, since Jeremy Corbyn and his cabal of revolutionaries took control of the Labour party which I had so admired and supported with commitment and enthusiasm. \u201cFrom the very outset of Mr Corbyn\u2019s leadership I had feared the ultra-Left Marxist/Socialist nature of the Labour party\u2019s new leadership and its supporters, all of which led me to conclude that a socialist republic for our nation was what these politicians intend. \u201cI have observed the intimidation and the bullying that has become endemic within the party and its supporters for all to see, and it is therefore with a sense of actual relief and optimism that I\u2019ve witnessed the emergence of these brave politicians who put country before party. \u201cI am hopeful that there may yet be a bright outcome from the sadness and despair of what was once a proud and courageous Labour party. I\u2019ve been asked whether I will financially support the new group. I have already done so.\u201d The Labour leader and his team strongly deny any suggestion that they tolerate antisemitism. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, hit back at TIG in an article for the Observer, saying the group is \u201cnow the real barrier to change\u201d. She added: \u201cFrom what we have seen and heard so far, all that we know is they would continue Tory policies from endless privatisation to sky-high tuition fees.\u201d Meanwhile, senior party figures are also calling on Corbyn and his leading allies to agree to delaying the process of reselecting MPs until after this year. Three party sources told the Observer that some of the leader\u2019s allies were keen to start the process, which could lead to the deselection of sitting MPs. A Labour spokesperson said it was \u201ccategorically untrue\u201d that any list of seats had been drawn up as part of the first wave of the reselection process.",

Rashford is likely to start up front in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/22/solskjaer-manchester-united-history-liverpool\" title=\"\">the early spring blockbuster against Liverpool </a>at Old Trafford. This is the kind of game he likes. There have been some barren scoring spells during those three years but also goals against Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City (twice) and Spurs, not to mention Spain home and away last year.</p> \n<p>Plus, of course, Rashford is now United\u2019s first-choice No 9, reward for his development under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r and another stage ticked off for a player who has always seemed to be growing in one way or another. Both literally \u2013 an inch and a half in height since that debut against Midtjylland \u2013 and also as an inbetweener at this level, all talent and potential energy, just looking for a space to fit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3212636d194dbea190edecafa58d9a502099f95\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3212636d194dbea190edecafa58d9a502099f95/0_375_3603_2162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England Under-16s, including Marcus Rashford, line up against Wales in November 2012\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England Under-16s line up against Wales in November 2012 and Marcus Rashford (back row, third left) can barely see over the mascot.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rawcliffe/Propaganda</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The influence of Solskj\u00e6r, his fifth club and country manager, has been profound. As recently as October there was talk of Rashford needing to move away from Old Trafford to progress. Fast forward 10 weeks and such is the rush of post-Jos\u00e9 goodwill, the sense of a club rediscovering something of its own mythology for attacking play and on-brand homegrown youth, you could make a case that Rashford is now the single most important person at Manchester United.</p> \n<p>He has had to cling to the rigging at times. Even that spectacular debut three years ago on Monday had its random elements. Rashford would not have been close to the squad if United had not had 14 players out injured. He would not have been there to take the call had United accepted a loan offer from Crewe shortly before.

      "bodyText": "There is a famous photo of Marcus Rashford lining up with his teammates before an England Under-16s fixture. Glancing down the row of likely lads you notice an adorably baby-faced Joe Gomez, the youthful Dominic Solanke, looking pretty much the same as the adult Dominic Solanke, and towards the far end a gap in the line where a face should be. Except, look closer and there is someone there, almost blocked from view by the looming outline of the small girl standing in front of him. Yes, it\u2019s Rashford. And yes, he\u2019s tiny, peeping out between the schoolkids with the same sense of quiet poise that has carried him through the past three years, almost to the day, since his debut for Manchester United. It is a personal anniversary that will be marked on Sunday by another epic-looking engagement. Rashford is likely to start up front in the early spring blockbuster against Liverpool at Old Trafford. This is the kind of game he likes. There have been some barren scoring spells during those three years but also goals against Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City (twice) and Spurs, not to mention Spain home and away last year. Plus, of course, Rashford is now United\u2019s first-choice No 9, reward for his development under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r and another stage ticked off for a player who has always seemed to be growing in one way or another. Both literally \u2013 an inch and a half in height since that debut against Midtjylland \u2013 and also as an inbetweener at this level, all talent and potential energy, just looking for a space to fit. The influence of Solskj\u00e6r, his fifth club and country manager, has been profound. As recently as October there was talk of Rashford needing to move away from Old Trafford to progress. Fast forward 10 weeks and such is the rush of post-Jos\u00e9 goodwill, the sense of a club rediscovering something of its own mythology for attacking play and on-brand homegrown youth, you could make a case that Rashford is now the single most important person at Manchester United. He has had to cling to the rigging at times. Even that spectacular debut three years ago on Monday had its random elements. Rashford would not have been close to the squad if United had not had 14 players out injured. He would not have been there to take the call had United accepted a loan offer from Crewe shortly before. He would not have started had Anthony Martial not twanged a hamstring in the warm-up (Rashford told his mum not to even bother turning up, he was so unlikely to play). He might not have made any impression at all if Louis van Gaal had not sat him down at half\u2011time and told him to stop running so much, to linger more in front of goal. Rashford listened, scored twice in the second half, then got two more against Arsenal three days later on his league debut. Still adjusting to playing centrally, still being urged to acquire \u201ca real goal addiction\u201d by his under-18s coach, Paul McGuinness, Rashford was flushed right out into the light, asked to complete his final growth spurt in public. Since then it has been, as Louis would say, a process. Albeit one that takes in the false turns as well as the good times. Such is the rush to junk every part of the Mourinho regime it is often assumed he did nothing but obstruct Rashford\u2019s progress. Take away the Jos\u00e9 years and Rashford has 12 goals in 31 games for United under his first and last managers. But Mourinho is a big part of this story, if only as confirmation of Rashford\u2019s ability to adapt and survive.

And then we conceded this goal, I think it was not a fair result at half time. It was difficult to find a solution because they played a deep block. But we tried a lot of good moves, without success. We came back in the game with the goal from Jonny, but after we conceded the second goal on the counter attack we did not manage the game. It was difficult to keep a structure. I think it was not a foul before their first goal. We were unlucky in this moment. Of course it is a worrying time. We have played a few games with quality, without getting the result, and now we are in difficulty. It will be tough, but we have to build confidence. It\u2019s a young team.

I was fouled for the first goal, but it\u2019s up to the referee to decide, if they\u2019re angry about it, it doesn\u2019t bother us. I\u2019m sure the manager is buzzing, because he set up the team just how he wanted it.\u201d He momentarily fails to hide his disappointment when he\u2019s told he\u2019ll not be getting the man-of-the-match award for his two-goal performance, as BT Sport\u2019s John Hartson awarded it to James Tomkins instead.

Claude Puel talks. \u201cWe made a good performance in the first half, with good chances, good play. And then we conceded this goal, I think it was not a fair result at half time. It was difficult to find a solution because they played a deep block. But we tried a lot of good moves, without success. We came back in the game with the goal from Jonny, but after we conceded the second goal on the counter attack we did not manage the game. It was difficult to keep a structure. I think it was not a foul before their first goal. We were unlucky in this moment. Of course it is a worrying time. We have played a few games with quality, without getting the result, and now we are in difficulty. It will be tough, but we have to build confidence. It\u2019s a young team. We need a positive attitude. It\u2019s a difficult period in the season, but we must keep going.\u201d Roy Hodgson speaks to BT Sport! \u201cIt was a very good win, a very dogged performance. We started slowly, were fortunate enough to get the goal, dug in during the second half, and took the chances that came our way. Age is a number, it\u2019s really how you feel and how capable you are.\u201d Wilfried Zaha speaks! \u201cIt\u2019s a massive result, we\u2019re trying to keep the run going, and do what we have to do. I made sure I got a good connection on the ball for my first goal, and score for the team. I was fouled for the first goal, but it\u2019s up to the referee to decide, if they\u2019re angry about it, it doesn\u2019t bother us. I\u2019m sure the manager is buzzing, because he set up the team just how he wanted it.\u201d He momentarily fails to hide his disappointment when he\u2019s told he\u2019ll not be getting the man-of-the-match award for his two-goal performance, as BT Sport\u2019s John Hartson awarded it to James Tomkins instead. But he\u2019s not down for long. \u201cI\u2019m shocked!\u201d he quips, before walking off smiling. That\u2019s a great three points for Palace. They\u2019re now in 13th spot on 30 points, above Burnley on goal difference and two points clear of Newcastle, who also won today. They\u2019re still far from safe - just six points clear of 18th-placed Southampton - but on tonight\u2019s display they\u2019ll surely be fine. Leicester, though ... they\u2019ve just lost four games in a row at home for the first time since 2000, and are only two points better off than Palace, in 12th spot with 32 points. So if Palace can\u2019t yet count their chickens, neither can Leicester ... and they\u2019re seriously short of confidence right now. The unpopular Claude Puel\u2019s jacket is currently hanging on a very shoogly peg. And that\u2019s it! Leicester had most of the possession, but did very little with it. Palace weren\u2019t particularly good in the first half, but they were excellent in the second, and thoroughly deserved their victory. What a way for Roy Hodgson to celebrate becoming the Premier League\u2019s oldest manager. He\u2019s certainly the Premier League\u2019s wisest manager tonight, his team having thrashed Leicester using his rope-a-dope tactics. Maguire, dozing as he strides upfield, is stripped of the ball by Ayew, who races up the other end. Ayew slips a pass right for Zaha, who slaps a shot towards the bottom right. Schmeichel should keep it out, but the power\u2019s too much for him. The King Power descends into rancour. 90 min +2: Gray wins a corner down the left and takes it himself. He instigates a bit of head tennis, but nothing more. 90 min +1: Maguire crosses from the right. Guaita comes out to claim. Vardy, racing in, kicks the keeper on the left. It\u2019s not a great challenge, and he should be booked. But the ref shows no interest in that. 90 min: There will be four added minutes. 88 min: Okazaki decides to go direct, welting a long pass down the right for Vardy to chase. It\u2019s not the worst idea, but Tomkins is wise to the grift and positions himself well to intercept. 87 min: Batshuayi - who demonstrated great instinct to score his first Palace goal, and has played very well tonight -is replaced by Ayew. 85 min: Okazaki replaces Barnes, one of Leicester\u2019s few stand-out players tonight. 84 min: On this evidence, you have to wonder how Leicester beat Manchester City and drew at Anfield. They\u2019ve had so much of the ball, yet Guaita has had very little to do in the Palace net. Milivojevic sidefoots powerfully to the right, Schmeichel having been sent the other way. That\u2019s Milivojevic\u2019s seventh successful penalty this season! 81 min: Schlupp crosses from the left. Batshuayi fires hard towards the bottom left. Schmeichel saves well, but Schlupp comes again from the wing. Evans hangs out a leg, and Schlupp doesn\u2019t look the gift horse in the mouth. He goes over Evans\u2019 leg, and that\u2019s a penalty. Schmeichel is booked for arguing the toss. 80 min: Townsend is replaced by the more conservative Kouyate, as Palace look to lock down what they have. 79 min: Gray glides in from the left and shoots for the top right. The ball\u2019s deflected off Milivojevic for another corner on the right. Maddison sticks it in the mixer this time, no messing. Some head tennis. Palace clear their lines yet again. 78 min: Maddison plays a shot corner, then faffs about. The over-elaboration allows Palace to clear. That\u2019s a terrible waste in the circumstances. 77 min: Vardy busies himself down the right and wins a corner. Before it can be taken, Dann comes on for the self-hobbled Sakho. 76 min: Sakho, so skilful yet slightly awkward of gait, injures himself while making a simple pass up the left flank. He might have twisted a knee. He\u2019s down getting treatment. 74 min: Iheanacho comes on for Tielemans, who was intermittently impressive this evening. Iheanacho hasn\u2019t scored for 20 games. Now would be a good time to rediscover the knack. 73 min: Townsend peels off down the right. He makes up 80 yards and nearly finds Zaha at the far post with a floated cross. Evans does very well to head clear of danger. 72 min: Barnes tries to respond instantly, driving down the left and whistling a low cross through the Palace area. Nobody in blue takes a chance on him. Sakho leads the charge upfield. McArthur then drops a shoulder to the left of the D to make himself a little space. He dinks a cross towards Zaha, who is coming in from the right, totally unmarked. He meets the dropping ball on the edge of the six-yard box and bashes a sidefoot past a helpless Schmeichel! Batshuayi was in the middle, miles offside, but not interfering with play. Not sure Schmeichel sees it that way, mind you. 69 min: Barnes has a dig from distance. That one pings off a white shirt and out for another corner, on the right. Maddison takes, and sends it sailing over everyone in the box. A dreadful delivery that allows Palace to counter. And from that break ... 68 min: Leicester have taken it up a notch. Tielemans sprays a pass wide right for Pereira, who is sent scampering into acres of space and should be ashamed of himself for hitting the first man with his cross. 66 min: There\u2019s an extra spring in Leicester\u2019s step now. Maguire strides down the left in the Jan Vertonghen style, then slips a pass down the channel for Vardy, who\u2019s clear in the box! But the angle\u2019s no good for a shot. He tries to cut back for Maddison, free on the penalty spot, but gets it all wrong. So much better from the hosts, though! What tonic a goal brings. Fuchs flings it long. Maddison wins a header, flicking on towards Barnes on the right. Barnes fires a low cross into the mixer. Evans, who had been up for the throw, swivels and slams a shot into the bottom right! That came out of nothing, because neither side had been offering much. But finally there\u2019s something for the Leicester faithful to sing about! 63 min: Barnes busies himself down the left, his pressing forcing Ward into a hack into the stands. And from the resulting throw, near the corner flag ... 61 min: Maddison tries a curler from the left-hand edge of the Palace box. It flies wide of the top-right corner. This is a poor match. 60 min: Zaha shows a turn of pace down the left to earn a corner off Pereira. The set piece falls to Ndidi, who breaks upfield and promptly loses possession. Palace give it up again. Leicester give it up again. A farcical passage of play, like a PlayStation game when neither player knows which buttons to press. 59 min: Maddison\u2019s corner from the right is perhaps overly ambitious, a swerving, dipping shot aimed for the top left! Guaita knows exactly what\u2019s going on, and is in position to gently pluck the ball from the sky. 58 min: Pereira drives down the inside right, enters the area, and attempts to find Vardy inside with a chipped cross. It\u2019s deflected out for a corner. 56 min: Tielemans tries to release Barnes with a rolled pass down the inside-left channel. It\u2019s a lovely idea, and Barnes has the legs on Ward, but Guaita reads the danger well, tearing out of his box to batter clear. 54 min: At least that got the crowd going again. They\u2019re also impressed when Barnes embarks on a neat dribble down the left. But he can\u2019t find the final pass that would release Tielemans. 52 min: With Maddison and Fuchs standing over the free kick, Maguire and Sakho get involved in a light shoving match. The ref tells them both to grow up. Maddison then pings the free kick off the wall. It spins to Fuchs on the right. He wedges a cross into the mixer. Maguire tries to head forward, but there\u2019s no real power or direction on his effort. Palace clear. 51 min: Maddison tries to dribble his way down the inside-right channel. He\u2019s nudged in the back by McArthur, who picks up his sixth booking of the season. And this is a free-kick in a very dangerous position, just to the right of the D. 49 min: Leicester have gained 13 points from losing positions in the league this season. That\u2019s a divisional best, with Arsenal and West Ham on 12. Not that the home fans seem particularly hopeful. They\u2019ve fallen silent, with the Palace fans making all the noise. 47 min: Evans steps up from the back and whips a diagonal ball, right to left, that reaches Fuchs, just inside the area. There\u2019s enough pace on the ball for Fuchs to simply flick his eyebrows at it, in the hope of diverting it into the top left. Not enough eyebrow; the ball sails harmlessly wide left. Lovely ball from Evans, though. Leicester get the second half started. One half-time change: Gray has replaced Ghezzal. Half-time reading. If Palace hold onto this, it would be a crucial win. Because earlier on today, down near the bottom, this happened ... ... and even earlier there was this! There\u2019s just enough time for Leicester to win a corner down the right, and for Maguire to send a poor header over the bar. And that\u2019s the half-time whistle. It\u2019s been all Leicester, though they\u2019ve not seriously worked Guaita. Palace had one attempt, and they\u2019ve scored from it. That\u2019s the unpredictable nature of football, and why we both love and hate it in equal measure! Schmeichel accompanies the ref down the tunnel, ranting and raving. 44 min: Tielemans tries to whip one into the bottom left from 25 yards. It\u2019s not a bad effort but always going wide, and Guaita calmly watches it sail by. 42 min: Schmeichel races after the referee, livid at the award of a free kick for Zaha in the centre circle, the move for the goal having started from there. Or maybe he\u2019s angry at the non-award of a penalty. Either way, the ref\u2019s not interested at all. It\u2019s been all Leicester, so this had to happen. Milivojevic, to the left of the centre circle, fires a pass forward to McArthur, 25 yards out, level with the right-hand post. McArthur shoots towards the bottom left. Perhaps it\u2019s going wide. The ball passes Batshuayi, who sticks out a leg and diverts it towards the bottom right ... and it\u2019s in, past a wrong-footed Schmeichel! That\u2019s a great instinctive goal. 40 min: Barnes dribbles into the Palace box from the left. He goes over near Tomkins, and claims a penalty. But there\u2019s nothing doing; the defender got the ball. 39 min: Tielemans, Pereira and the ever-busy Maddison nearly open up Palace down the right with some very intricate close passing. But then Tielemans clumsily clips the back of van Aanholt, and Palace are let off the hook. 38 min: Tielemans crosses from a deep position on the left. It\u2019s deflected, and nearly finds Ghezzal clear, breaking down the channel. But Ghezzal opts to settle for the corner instead. The set piece is fizzed in low, and headed away very bravely by Tomkins. 36 min: Palace have been fouling for fun since the get-go, but it\u2019s a Leicester player who goes in the book first. Ndidi clips Schlupp from behind, and that\u2019s a yellow card. On the touchline, Puel debates this with the fourth official in the passionate continental style. 34 min: Maddison\u2019s free kick, aimed for the top left, clips the Palace wall and twangs into the arms of Guaita. Leicester are soon coming again, Tielemans slipping a ball down the inside-left channel for Maddison, whose shot from a tight angle is straight at the keeper. 32 min: Leicester pin Palace back in their own area. Quite a bit of pinball in the box. Palace just about get away with it, but then Milivojevic clips Maddison to the ground, and this is a very dangerous free kick just to the left of the D. 30 min: Townsend brings down Maddison, 30 yards from goal on the left. Leicester load the box, but the delivery is poor and easily cleared. Tielemans tries to retrieve the ball, but is do-si-do\u2019d out of play by Zaha. It\u2019s an ersatz version of Ramos-Salah, and Tielemans ends up on his knees on the pitch border. No foul, for some reason. 28 min: Well, Palace have done very little so far, but they should have caused Leicester some serious trouble here. Batshuayi drives at the Leicester back line. He reaches the edge of the box, and has Zaha totally free to his left, but the attempted pass clanks into Evans and the hosts can clear. That\u2019s an appalling effort, a great opportunity wasted, and you can understand Zaha\u2019s theatrical frustration. 27 min: Fuchs floats a pass down the inside-left channel and nearly releases Vardy. Just a little too much air on that. Guaita gathers. 25 min: The home crowd are getting a little agitated. Ghezzal accidentally plays a simple pass ten yards behind the nearby Pereira. No harm done, but the Leicester faithful don\u2019t seem in the mood to cut Claude Puel\u2019s team some slack, and deliver pelters accordingly. 23 min: Ndidi decides to have a shy at goal from the best part of 30 yards. That\u2019s no good at all. Full marks for ambition, I suppose. 21 min: Palace are offering absolutely nowt. 19 min: Barnes spins 30 yards from goal and sends a bobbling bouncer towards the bottom right. Guaita claims it easily enough, there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of power in that. But if Leicester keep on shooting at this healthy rate - that\u2019s six attempts already - someone\u2019s going to catch one at some point. 18 min: Vardy goes blazing down the left wing. He\u2019s roughed up a little in full flight by Ward, and Tielemans claims a free kick for his team-mate, but the ref\u2019s not interested at all. 16 min: There\u2019s not a whole lot going on right now. Time to wheel out a stat, they\u2019re always good when you have nothing of note to say: Leicester are enjoying the bulk of the possession, with 65% of the ball. 14 min: A corner for Palace out on the right. Milivojevic has two goes at beating the first man, and fails both times. Leicester tear upfield on the break, and Tielemans is stopped from dribbling down the left by Zaha, who leaves his studs on his opponent\u2019s shin. That\u2019s a really poor challenge, and if the referee had seen it, he could 12 min: Tielemans is a very tidy player indeed. He skitters in from the left, exchanges passes with Barnes, and tries to curl one into the top right. There\u2019s not quite enough oomph in the effort, and it\u2019s an easy claim from Guaita. Leicester are beginning to ask questions. 10 min: Vardy\u2019s in the mood now. He busies himself down the inside-left channel and cuts back for Maddison, who looks to send a powerful curler into the top right. It\u2019s a decent effort, but flicks off Sakho\u2019s shoulder and out for a corner. Maddison claims half-heartedly for a penalty, but there\u2019s no way. And nothing comes of the set piece. 9 min: Good work by Barnes out on the left. He scoops a cross into the box for Vardy, who wins a header but can only flash it over the bar. 6 min: Zaha cuts in from the left and slips a pass to McArthur, who tries to release van Aanholt with a cute pass down the channel. But the Palace full-back has wandered a mile offside, and a promising position on the edge of the Leicester box is wasted. 5 min: It\u2019s a little bit hectic and scrappy. Passing moves at a premium in these early stages. 3 min: Maddison and Tielemans nearly balls it up, the former tapping to the latter, who dilly-dallies and nearly gets closed down. But Tielemans gets a shot away just in time. Despite a big deflection, Guaita isn\u2019t going to be troubled by that, and he gathers easily enough. 2 min: Now Leicester take a turn at knocking it around. Schlupp gets fed up and clatters Maddison to the floor. This\u2019ll be a free kick in a central position, 35 yards from the Palace goal. Here we go, then! Palace get the match started, and stroke it about the back awhile. Then Zaha goes off on a run down the left. He goes nowhere, but don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t be his last of the evening. The teams are out! Leicester wear their famous blue shirts, with black armbands today in memory of Gordon Banks. Palace are in their change strip of white with Team-of-the-Eighties retro sash. Before kick-off, there\u2019s a minute of the warmest applause, as the King Power pays its respects to the life and stellar achievements of one of football\u2019s true greats. We\u2019ll be off in a minute. How does Roy Hodgson feel about becoming the oldest manager in Premier League history? \u201cI am proud of my career and journey, though I don\u2019t know there\u2019s too much to be proud of in just becoming old enough to be given that title! But I\u2019m still glad to be here, that\u2019s the most important thing, and I\u2019m really satisfied with the career football has given me. I\u2019m also very happy that I\u2019m here to be enjoying it to this day. It\u2019s nice to be recognised in the company of such great men as Bobby Robson and Alex Ferguson, so it\u2019s a good day in that respect, though it\u2019ll only be a really good day if we get a result today.\u201d His opposite number Claude Puel adds: \u201cRoy has a fantastic record. I do not think I will rival him! But I offer him a lot of congratulation, he is a fantastic man and manager. I just hope he cannot have good luck today! It\u2019ll be an emotional day for Leicester, as they get a chance to say farewell to their legendary keeper Gordon Banks, who passed away earlier this month. The 1966 World Cup winner played 356 times for the Foxes between 1959 and 1967, winning the 1964 League Cup and turning out in the 1961 and 1963 FA Cup finals. He also very nearly won the league title while at Filbert Street, as part of the ill-fated Ice Kings side of 1962-63. Anyone unfamiliar with that particular bittersweet tale should click below now. Leicester make two changes to the XI named for the 3-1 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur a fortnight ago. Jamie Vardy replaces Demarai Gray, who drops to the bench, while Christian Fuchs comes in for the injured Ben Chilwell. Palace make five changes to the side that brushed past Doncaster Rovers in the fifth round of the FA Cup last weekend. Vincente Guaita, James Tomkins, Mamadou Sakho, James McArthur and Wilfried Zaha replace Wayne Hennessey, Scott Dann, Martin Kelly, Max Meyer and Jordan Ayew. All of them drop to the bench, bar Kelly who is injured. Leicester City: Schmeichel, Ricardo Pereira, Evans, Maguire, Fuchs, Tielemans, Ndidi, Maddison, Ghezzal, Vardy, Barnes. Subs: Soyuncu, Morgan, Gray, Iheanacho, Ward, Okazaki, Mendy. Crystal Palace: Guaita, Ward, Tomkins, Sakho, Van Aanholt, McArthur, Milivojevic, Schlupp, Townsend, Batshuayi, Zaha. Subs: Dann, Meyer, Kouyate, Hennessey, Ayew, Benteke, Riedewald. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). It\u2019s a historic day in Leicester. Not quite up there with the discovery of the remains of Richard III, perhaps, but notable enough, as Roy I becomes the oldest man ever to manage a team in the Premier League. Hodgson is 71 years and 199 days young today. That means the Crystal Palace boss sashays past the legendary Sir Bobby Robson, who was 71 years and 191 days old when he took charge of his final game for Newcastle United. So hats off to King Roy. There\u2019s a fair chance he\u2019ll be celebrating a win tonight, too. That\u2019s because Leicester are on a dismal run, having taken just one point from the last 15 available. And they\u2019ve lost their last three matches against Palace, shipping nine goals while failing to score themselves. Claude Puel, never popular at the King Power, could do with three points this afternoon to stem the bleeding. Palace need the win to keep them insulated from relegation worries. A tense tussle awaits us. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 5.30pm BST.",

      "body": "<h2>Wales</h2> <p><strong>Liam Williams </strong>A dangerous runner from deep but made effective contributions in defence too, not least in the air. Wales\u2019s best back. <strong>9</strong></p> <p><strong>George North </strong>We take a collective breath when he is on the ball but struggled to escape shackles. No weaknesses exposed by England though. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Jonathan Davies</strong> A classy operator. Plays a key defensive role and has so much experience \u2013 pivotal in helping Wales back into the match. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Hadleigh Parkes</strong> Not much gets past him and this was more like his performances of last year. His dash down the right brought crowd to its feet. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Josh Adams</strong> Had a quietish afternoon until he plucked Biggar\u2019s kick at the second attempt to make the game safe. Is proving a real find. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Gareth Anscombe</strong> Kicked too often in first half but was more varied in the second once he stopped forcing things. No surprise Biggar came on. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Gareth Davies</strong> A mixed bag. Did well to charge Farrell down but some handling errors. Perhaps over-eagerness got the better of him at times. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Rob Evans</strong> Made more than his fair share of tackles and hit ruck after ruck. Made way on the hour mark with the tank emptied. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Ken Owens</strong> Culpable for Curry\u2019s try but is not Wales\u2019s most-capped hooker for nothing and responded well. Carried the fight all afternoon. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Tomas Francis</strong> Takes credit for Wales bulldozing scrum near the end of the first half. Honours even against his Exeter teammate Moon. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Alun Wyn Jones (capt)</strong> Produced one of his excellent performances. His leadership was the most significant reason Wales won. <strong>9 Man of the match</strong></p> <p><strong>Cory Hill</strong> Is established as key part of this side alongside his captain and on hand to score when it looked like England might hold firm. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Josh Navidi</strong> Made a few handling mistakes but topped the Welsh tackle count and he did what he was there to do. Tireless. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Justin Tipuric</strong> Badly caught out for Curry\u2019s try but other than that he was everywhere. Provides a valuable lineout option as well. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Ross Moriarty</strong> Missed a few tackles but brings an abrasive edge to back-row. Enjoyed his battle with Vunipola and came out on top. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>REPLACEMENTS: Elliot Dee</strong> (for Owens 77) <strong>N/A</strong>, <strong>Nicky Smith </strong>(for Evans 61<strong>) 6; Dillon Lewis </strong>(for Francis 61) <strong>7; Adam Beard </strong>(for Hill 71)<strong> N/A; Aaron Wainwright </strong>(for Moriarty 77) <strong>N/A; Aled Davies</strong> (for Gareth Davies 77)<strong> N/A; Dan Biggar </strong>(for Anscombe 61) Made a huge difference<strong> 8; Owen Watkin </strong>(for Parkes 79)<strong> N/A</strong></p> <h2>England</h2> <p><strong>Elliot Daly </strong>Rare miss with a long-range penalty. Looked to counter whenever Wales kicked too long but at fault for Adams\u2019s try. <strong>5/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Jack Nowell</strong> Seemed to hurt his shoulder very early on but grew into the match. Showed his usual ability to wriggle through holes that do not seem there. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Henry Slade</strong> Showed juggling skills again and so nearly got away after chargedown. Some pace in buildup to Curry\u2019s try, but not as effective as in previous games. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Manu Tuilagi</strong> Very quiet in the first half, with just one carry, but much more to the fore in the second. His best came when England needed it on the hour. Key tackle on Parkes. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Jonny May</strong> No early try this week, indeed quiet for most of the first half, but celebrated chase and tackle on Parkes wildly. Went off with a head injury. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Owen Farrell (capt)</strong> Uncharacteristically poor start, regathered himself and started dictating play with clever kicking, but could not stem the tide. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Ben Youngs</strong> Scrambled well just before half-time and kicked well enough but as one of the senior figures he will be disappointed with how England let their lead slip. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Ben Moon</strong> England\u2019s coalminer, says Eddie Jones, and another decent shift. Stayed on until the closing stages but Genge\u2019s dynamism may have been more effective earlier. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Jamie George</strong> Made an important turnover in the first half and 22 tackles in total. Did little wrong and can consider himself unfortunate to end up on losing side. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Kyle Sinckler</strong> A time-bomb? Certainly explosive. Everywhere in the first half, with thundering tackles and carriers. Won a big scrum, even chased kicks but discipline lapsed after the break. Sensibly withdrawn. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Courtney Lawes</strong> He and Sinckler carried the fight to Wales, making thumping tackles on Moriarty, Williams and Tipuric to name three.

      "bodyText": "Wales Liam Williams A dangerous runner from deep but made effective contributions in defence too, not least in the air. Wales\u2019s best back. 9 George North We take a collective breath when he is on the ball but struggled to escape shackles. No weaknesses exposed by England though. 7 Jonathan Davies A classy operator. Plays a key defensive role and has so much experience \u2013 pivotal in helping Wales back into the match. 8 Hadleigh Parkes Not much gets past him and this was more like his performances of last year. His dash down the right brought crowd to its feet. 8 Josh Adams Had a quietish afternoon until he plucked Biggar\u2019s kick at the second attempt to make the game safe. Is proving a real find. 8 Gareth Anscombe Kicked too often in first half but was more varied in the second once he stopped forcing things. No surprise Biggar came on. 6 Gareth Davies A mixed bag. Did well to charge Farrell down but some handling errors. Perhaps over-eagerness got the better of him at times. 7 Rob Evans Made more than his fair share of tackles and hit ruck after ruck. Made way on the hour mark with the tank emptied. 7 Ken Owens Culpable for Curry\u2019s try but is not Wales\u2019s most-capped hooker for nothing and responded well. Carried the fight all afternoon. 8 Tomas Francis Takes credit for Wales bulldozing scrum near the end of the first half. Honours even against his Exeter teammate Moon. 6 Alun Wyn Jones (capt) Produced one of his excellent performances. His leadership was the most significant reason Wales won. 9 Man of the match Cory Hill Is established as key part of this side alongside his captain and on hand to score when it looked like England might hold firm. 8 Josh Navidi Made a few handling mistakes but topped the Welsh tackle count and he did what he was there to do. Tireless. 8 Justin Tipuric Badly caught out for Curry\u2019s try but other than that he was everywhere. Provides a valuable lineout option as well. 8 Ross Moriarty Missed a few tackles but brings an abrasive edge to back-row. Enjoyed his battle with Vunipola and came out on top. 7 REPLACEMENTS: Elliot Dee (for Owens 77) N/A, Nicky Smith (for Evans 61) 6; Dillon Lewis (for Francis 61) 7; Adam Beard (for Hill 71) N/A; Aaron Wainwright (for Moriarty 77) N/A; Aled Davies (for Gareth Davies 77) N/A; Dan Biggar (for Anscombe 61) Made a huge difference 8; Owen Watkin (for Parkes 79) N/A England Elliot Daly Rare miss with a long-range penalty. Looked to counter whenever Wales kicked too long but at fault for Adams\u2019s try. 5/10 Jack Nowell Seemed to hurt his shoulder very early on but grew into the match. Showed his usual ability to wriggle through holes that do not seem there. 7 Henry Slade Showed juggling skills again and so nearly got away after chargedown. Some pace in buildup to Curry\u2019s try, but not as effective as in previous games. 6 Manu Tuilagi Very quiet in the first half, with just one carry, but much more to the fore in the second. His best came when England needed it on the hour. Key tackle on Parkes. 7 Jonny May No early try this week, indeed quiet for most of the first half, but celebrated chase and tackle on Parkes wildly. Went off with a head injury. 6 Owen Farrell (capt) Uncharacteristically poor start, regathered himself and started dictating play with clever kicking, but could not stem the tide. 5 Ben Youngs Scrambled well just before half-time and kicked well enough but as one of the senior figures he will be disappointed with how England let their lead slip. 6 Ben Moon England\u2019s coalminer, says Eddie Jones, and another decent shift. Stayed on until the closing stages but Genge\u2019s dynamism may have been more effective earlier. 6 Jamie George Made an important turnover in the first half and 22 tackles in total. Did little wrong and can consider himself unfortunate to end up on losing side. 7 Kyle Sinckler A time-bomb? Certainly explosive. Everywhere in the first half, with thundering tackles and carriers. Won a big scrum, even chased kicks but discipline lapsed after the break. Sensibly withdrawn. 7 Courtney Lawes He and Sinckler carried the fight to Wales, making thumping tackles on Moriarty, Williams and Tipuric to name three. Pinched the ball for Curry\u2019s try. Looks an injury concern. 7 George Kruis His hits are not as eye-catching as Lawes\u2019s but he makes a shedload of them, including a staggering 12 in the first quarter. Made a key lineout steal too and carried hard. 8 Mark Wilson Another big shift from England\u2019s unsung hero but as Wales got on top at the breakdown he could do little to stop it. 7 Tom Curry Must have lungs the size of oil drums. Got through a huge amount of work and had the wherewithal to spot the gap for first England try. 7 Billy Vunipola Conceded a silly penalty. Had a few carriers off a long run but Wales were ready for it.

The forward quickly acknowledged the ensuing yellow card as Chris Wilder\u2019s superbly organised team ensured they suffered no repeat of their recent late collapse, when Aston Villa came back to draw from 3-0 down. One was enough here.</p> <p>The Sheffield United manager was, as ever, staying grounded. \u201cOur season is not done and dusted because we\u2019ve won here and it wouldn\u2019t have been done and dusted if we\u2019d lost,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Nor was Wilder entirely satisfied with the quality of his team\u2019s performance. \u201cThe positives were the way we stopped good players playing,\u201d he added. \u201cI didn\u2019t think after we broke it up we controlled the game as much as we should have done. But we\u2019re delighted we\u2019ve won a tight game. [We were] not our best with the ball but at our very best without it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/23/football-league-norwich-win-a-thriller-paul-scholess-oldham-lose-again\">Football League: Norwich win a thriller, Paul Scholes's Oldham lose again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Top spot had moved beyond either team\u2019s reach after Norwich and Leeds had survived challenging games earlier on but there was still a thrill in the air as two strong sides set about each other. West Brom were coming in to the game after doing what they do best \u2013 winning away, at QPR and Aston Villa \u2013 before succumbing to what they do worst: conceding at home.</p> <p>Despite their sustained promotion challenge, Moore\u2019s side have kept only two clean sheets at the Hawthorns in this exciting season; the most hospitable record in the division.</p> <p>So it was no great surprise when United took the lead in the 14th minute. The expansive nature of their wing-back system was reflected in the manner that Martin Cranie, ostensibly the right central defender, overlapped his own wing-back and even though Kieron Freeman\u2019s pass looked to have been overhit, the veteran kept going and managed to scoop his cross back towards the near post. There Dowell, on loan from Everton, rose strongly to send a looping header over Sam Johnstone into the far top corner.</p> <p>\u201cI thought he [had] put too much pace on the pass,\u201d Wilder admitted of Freeman\u2019s ball to the byline. \u201cThe old man has stretched for it and put a good ball into the box.\u201d</p> <p>West Brom, without a home win in their past five games, appeared somewhat edgy in their approach play initially and barely had a shot on target to speak of, United\u2019s keeper, Dean Henderson, saving at Jefferson Montero\u2019s feet in stoppage time.</p> <p>When they did dominate in the second half, Albion, trying to pick their way forwards narrowly, were unable to get penetration in wide areas. \u201cI put that down to teams coming here and putting men behind the ball and not wanting to play open football,\u201d Moore said. He admitted he may have to look at changing formation at home and is relishing a couple of midweeks without games to get back out on the training pitch.</p> <p>Both teams now approach tough fixtures: West Brom go to Leeds on Friday, while United visit Hillsborough in the derby three nights later. It promises to be a tight run-in as the Championship maintains its spell.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sheffield United maintained their hold on the second automatic promotion place in the Championship after Kieran Dowell\u2019s first-half header extended West Brom\u2019s increasingly unproductive home form. Darren Moore\u2019s team may have started the day as the division\u2019s leading scorers, having secured eight wins from their last nine away games, but they have now not won at the Hawthorns since Boxing Day as they missed the chance to overtake their promotion rivals. It was a fitting indictment on their lack of cutting edge against the Blades that the nearest they came to scoring arrived in the 84th minute, when Jay Rodriguez steered Mason Holgate\u2019s cross into the net with the use of his hand. The forward quickly acknowledged the ensuing yellow card as Chris Wilder\u2019s superbly organised team ensured they suffered no repeat of their recent late collapse, when Aston Villa came back to draw from 3-0 down. One was enough here. The Sheffield United manager was, as ever, staying grounded. \u201cOur season is not done and dusted because we\u2019ve won here and it wouldn\u2019t have been done and dusted if we\u2019d lost,\u201d he said. Nor was Wilder entirely satisfied with the quality of his team\u2019s performance. \u201cThe positives were the way we stopped good players playing,\u201d he added. \u201cI didn\u2019t think after we broke it up we controlled the game as much as we should have done. But we\u2019re delighted we\u2019ve won a tight game. [We were] not our best with the ball but at our very best without it.\u201d Top spot had moved beyond either team\u2019s reach after Norwich and Leeds had survived challenging games earlier on but there was still a thrill in the air as two strong sides set about each other. West Brom were coming in to the game after doing what they do best \u2013 winning away, at QPR and Aston Villa \u2013 before succumbing to what they do worst: conceding at home. Despite their sustained promotion challenge, Moore\u2019s side have kept only two clean sheets at the Hawthorns in this exciting season; the most hospitable record in the division. So it was no great surprise when United took the lead in the 14th minute. The expansive nature of their wing-back system was reflected in the manner that Martin Cranie, ostensibly the right central defender, overlapped his own wing-back and even though Kieron Freeman\u2019s pass looked to have been overhit, the veteran kept going and managed to scoop his cross back towards the near post. There Dowell, on loan from Everton, rose strongly to send a looping header over Sam Johnstone into the far top corner. \u201cI thought he [had] put too much pace on the pass,\u201d Wilder admitted of Freeman\u2019s ball to the byline. \u201cThe old man has stretched for it and put a good ball into the box.\u201d West Brom, without a home win in their past five games, appeared somewhat edgy in their approach play initially and barely had a shot on target to speak of, United\u2019s keeper, Dean Henderson, saving at Jefferson Montero\u2019s feet in stoppage time. When they did dominate in the second half, Albion, trying to pick their way forwards narrowly, were unable to get penetration in wide areas. \u201cI put that down to teams coming here and putting men behind the ball and not wanting to play open football,\u201d Moore said. He admitted he may have to look at changing formation at home and is relishing a couple of midweeks without games to get back out on the training pitch. Both teams now approach tough fixtures: West Brom go to Leeds on Friday, while United visit Hillsborough in the derby three nights later. It promises to be a tight run-in as the Championship maintains its spell.",

      "body": "<p>From the sublime to the submerged. England, imperious in the Six Nations\u2019 first two rounds, drowned under a tidal wave of emotion as Wales launched a second-half comeback to achieve their 12th successive victory and break a record that had stood for more than a century. It was a breathless, tactical, titanic battle that turned when Dan Biggar left the home bench on the hour.</p> \n<p>When the Northampton fly-half replaced Gareth Anscombe, Wales were 10-9 behind and had trailed for most of the match. Within six minutes they were ahead for the first time. Two years ago here it was England\u2019s replacements who helped swing the match, but a feature of Wales\u2019s unbeaten run since they lost in Dublin at this stage of the tournament a year ago has been the promotion of young players who have given them strength in depth.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/feb/23/wales-v-england-six-nations-2019-live\">Wales 21-13 England: Six Nations 2019 \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The experienced Biggar is not in that category but he was what Wales needed at a point in the match when lung-bursting desire and energy gave way to mental and physical fatigue. The England coach, Eddie Jones, had said in the buildup, presumably because of the landmark his opponents were looking to establish, that it was the best Wales team ever.</p> \n<p>If he was hoping his words would ruffle the home side and prompt them to play with hearts rather than heads, the arrival of Biggar ensured otherwise. Until then Wales had played with typical endeavour and spirit, neutralising England\u2019s kicking game and putting pressure on their half-backs, but their best hope of victory looked to be their opponents\u2019 indiscipline, which improved when Kyle Sinckler was replaced just before the hour.</p> \n<p>The prop, who had been singled out before the game by the Wales coach, Warren Gatland, as an emotional timebomb, had been explosive in the first half, making 16 tackles and winning the penalty at a scrum that gave England the lead after 16 minutes. Wales had had the greater possession and territory but were at times in too much of a hurry. England held them at arm\u2019s length, running from their own half only after a turnover and kicking if nothing materialised after three or four phases, waiting for mistakes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/23/france-scotland-six-nations-match-report\">France turn screw with late fourth try as Scotland\u2019s losing Paris run continues</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>England sabotaged Wales\u2019s lineout and were a threat at the breakdown through Tom Curry, who scored their try after 25 minutes when, after Ken Owens had lost possession in his own half as Wales tried to drive a maul, he spotted his opposite number, Justin Tipuric, looking the wrong way at a ruck near Wales\u2019s line and picked up for a soft score given the thunderous challenges that had preceded it.</p> \n<p>England had used their big ball-carriers, Billy Vunipola, Manu Tuilagi and Courtney Lawes, to storm the gainline and make dents in defenders, but Wales held firm, forcing Ben Youngs and Owen Farrell to kick. Wales picked Gareth Davies at scrum-half for the first time this tournament and part of his brief was to put pressure on Farrell as a way of neutralising the threat of Jonny May on the wing and it largely worked.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Wales switched wings, putting Josh Adams, with his quicker acceleration and narrower turning circle, against May rather than George North. A year ago at Twickenham, Adams, in his second Test, was exposed positionally as May scored two early tries, but here he was astute and alert, reacting quickly to one kick in the opening half when Elliot Daly would have had a run to the line.</p> \n<p>Wales gnawed away at England\u2019s 10-3 interval lead in the third quarter when two Anscombe penalties reduced the visitors\u2019 lead to a point \u2013 the second after Sinckler, having just given away a penalty for obstruction, involved himself in a touchline dispute that had nothing to do with him.</p> \n<p>And the certainty that had sustained England dissolved. They had been content to keep Wales at a distance but could not respond when they needed to be more inventive. One Tuilagi run apart, they barely mustered a threat in the second period, when their only points came from a penalty secured by the excellent Curry, who forced Hadleigh Parkes to hold on after a tackle.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for the Breakdown, our weekly rugby union email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up for the Breakdown, our weekly rugby union email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Wales were unflinching, which galvanised the crowd \u2013 but they needed someone to create a spark. Enter Biggar. He played scrum-half after a 34-phase move and a North run that took out three defenders, flicking a short pass to the second-row Cory Hill, who had the strength to break two tackles and the reach to make the line, just.</p> \n<p>Wales were in the lead for the first time with 13 minutes to go. England needed to find a response but their chief tactic had been thwarted by Wales\u2019s back three, led by Liam Williams, one of two who earn their livings in the Premiership, and also the first full-back with experience in the position that England had faced this season.</p> \n<p>The other Premiership player was Adams who, with three minutes to go and Wales looking to deliver a knockout blow and leave England without a bonus point, positioned himself on the right-hand touchline, exhorting Biggar to deliver a cross-kick \u2013 which the fly-half did with such precision that Adams was able to get above Daly, gather the ball at the second attempt and, summing up his team, make the line through sheer willpower. The score ensured the end of a run of five successive championship defeats against England.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09f726452d2ef91d123ee4e6edb36dc7e31d3dc6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09f726452d2ef91d123ee4e6edb36dc7e31d3dc6/0_90_4648_2789/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cory Hill goes over for Wales\u2019s first try, which swung the match in their favour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cory Hill goes over for Wales\u2019s first try, which swung the match in their favour.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Mullan/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/feb/23/eddie-jones-england-words-about-wales-warning-not-windup\">Eddie Jones\u2019s words about Wales prove to be a warning, not a wind-up | Andy Bull</a> </p> \n</aside>",

      "bodyText": "From the sublime to the submerged. England, imperious in the Six Nations\u2019 first two rounds, drowned under a tidal wave of emotion as Wales launched a second-half comeback to achieve their 12th successive victory and break a record that had stood for more than a century. It was a breathless, tactical, titanic battle that turned when Dan Biggar left the home bench on the hour. When the Northampton fly-half replaced Gareth Anscombe, Wales were 10-9 behind and had trailed for most of the match. Within six minutes they were ahead for the first time. Two years ago here it was England\u2019s replacements who helped swing the match, but a feature of Wales\u2019s unbeaten run since they lost in Dublin at this stage of the tournament a year ago has been the promotion of young players who have given them strength in depth. The experienced Biggar is not in that category but he was what Wales needed at a point in the match when lung-bursting desire and energy gave way to mental and physical fatigue. The England coach, Eddie Jones, had said in the buildup, presumably because of the landmark his opponents were looking to establish, that it was the best Wales team ever. If he was hoping his words would ruffle the home side and prompt them to play with hearts rather than heads, the arrival of Biggar ensured otherwise. Until then Wales had played with typical endeavour and spirit, neutralising England\u2019s kicking game and putting pressure on their half-backs, but their best hope of victory looked to be their opponents\u2019 indiscipline, which improved when Kyle Sinckler was replaced just before the hour. The prop, who had been singled out before the game by the Wales coach, Warren Gatland, as an emotional timebomb, had been explosive in the first half, making 16 tackles and winning the penalty at a scrum that gave England the lead after 16 minutes. Wales had had the greater possession and territory but were at times in too much of a hurry. England held them at arm\u2019s length, running from their own half only after a turnover and kicking if nothing materialised after three or four phases, waiting for mistakes. England sabotaged Wales\u2019s lineout and were a threat at the breakdown through Tom Curry, who scored their try after 25 minutes when, after Ken Owens had lost possession in his own half as Wales tried to drive a maul, he spotted his opposite number, Justin Tipuric, looking the wrong way at a ruck near Wales\u2019s line and picked up for a soft score given the thunderous challenges that had preceded it. England had used their big ball-carriers, Billy Vunipola, Manu Tuilagi and Courtney Lawes, to storm the gainline and make dents in defenders, but Wales held firm, forcing Ben Youngs and Owen Farrell to kick. Wales picked Gareth Davies at scrum-half for the first time this tournament and part of his brief was to put pressure on Farrell as a way of neutralising the threat of Jonny May on the wing and it largely worked. Wales switched wings, putting Josh Adams, with his quicker acceleration and narrower turning circle, against May rather than George North. A year ago at Twickenham, Adams, in his second Test, was exposed positionally as May scored two early tries, but here he was astute and alert, reacting quickly to one kick in the opening half when Elliot Daly would have had a run to the line. Wales gnawed away at England\u2019s 10-3 interval lead in the third quarter when two Anscombe penalties reduced the visitors\u2019 lead to a point \u2013 the second after Sinckler, having just given away a penalty for obstruction, involved himself in a touchline dispute that had nothing to do with him. And the certainty that had sustained England dissolved. They had been content to keep Wales at a distance but could not respond when they needed to be more inventive. One Tuilagi run apart, they barely mustered a threat in the second period, when their only points came from a penalty secured by the excellent Curry, who forced Hadleigh Parkes to hold on after a tackle. Wales were unflinching, which galvanised the crowd \u2013 but they needed someone to create a spark. Enter Biggar. He played scrum-half after a 34-phase move and a North run that took out three defenders, flicking a short pass to the second-row Cory Hill, who had the strength to break two tackles and the reach to make the line, just. Wales were in the lead for the first time with 13 minutes to go. England needed to find a response but their chief tactic had been thwarted by Wales\u2019s back three, led by Liam Williams, one of two who earn their livings in the Premiership, and also the first full-back with experience in the position that England had faced this season. The other Premiership player was Adams who, with three minutes to go and Wales looking to deliver a knockout blow and leave England without a bonus point, positioned himself on the right-hand touchline, exhorting Biggar to deliver a cross-kick \u2013 which the fly-half did with such precision that Adams was able to get above Daly, gather the ball at the second attempt and, summing up his team, make the line through sheer willpower. The score ensured the end of a run of five successive championship defeats against England.",

Flying in all competitions this time last year, defeat to Arsenal in the League Cup final sparked a collapse that meant they finished the season empty-handed. \u201cLast year we didn\u2019t get the strategy right, we ran out of steam,\u201d said Cushing. \u201cIt\u2019s all about strategy, we have a clear strategy in the types of players we sign and bring in, you can see that in the squad. Then it\u2019s about numbers of players and when they play and it\u2019s about getting that right and that\u2019s a collective process.\u201d There was not a better time to be playing Arsenal. Already nursing a hefty injury list that has shaken their fluidity and ended their FA Cup campaign, a further blow was revealed when the team sheet landed and the league top scorer, Miedema, was only deemed fit enough for the bench. When asked whether he was more proud of his team\u2019s performance this year than last, when they lifted this trophy, Joe Montemurro was emphatic: \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, Man City created the chances and we played in a little bit of an un-Arsenal and un-Joe Montemurro way. \u201cWe had to use the resources that were available to us but we found an Arsenal with a big heart, a team that has a massive backbone now and a team which has shown it wants to go forward and be the best.\u201d To deal with their defensive frailty, Montemurro set up with a back four and Kim Little playing deeper, alongside Dominique Bloodworth. In the first-half it seemed to hold up, just. With neither team able to string a sequence of passes together and both sitting deep, the uninspiring first period was cagey. As the half drew to a close City upped the ante, Caroline Weir\u2019s corner was met with a powerful Houghton header but Sari van Veenendaal got down low to block it before Gemma Bonner put the follow up wide from two yards out. The second half picked up where the first left off. With Bloodworth booked for bringing down Parris, Weir stepped up, her free-kick from the halfway line catching a backpedaling Parris who looped her athletic header over Van Veenendaal but it dipped on to the bar and Arsenal cleared. In the 68th minute, with Arsenal shaking, Montemurro threw caution to the wind, bringing on Miedema to try and spark some life into their attack. The best chance of extra time fell at the feet of Parris, the all-time WSL top-scorer, who outpaced Louise Quinn, but Van Veenendaal came racing out to knock the ball from her feet before reaching back to grasp it from her stretching legs. Then it was penalties. Stanway scored for City before Van Veenendaal kept out Hemp. Claire Emslie, Houghton and Beckie all finished for City, and while Little and Bloodworth scored for Arsenal, Williamson and Van de Donk drew fine saves from Bardsley. \u201cIt will galvanise us, it gives us momentum,\u201d said Cushing. \u201cWe lost this last year and it went downhill pretty quickly. I don\u2019t know if it will effect them [Arsenal], we just have to focus on ourselves. Montemurro, who turned his back on the shootout, was clear they will not give up the title without a fight: \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie and say the League and getting in the Champions League hasn\u2019t been our major focus, but we do want to compete and be at our best in every tournament. Now we can be a little bit more calculated in the way we approach the title and try to win this thing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Alun Wyn Jones speaks: \u201cI dunno, hopefully there\u2019s a few more ahead,\u201d says Athe Wales captain when asked by the BBC if this is his best day in rugby. \u201cThe people we had and the people who came on today stood up. Credit to England - the exchanges we had in that second half, we knew it was going to be a turnover or a bad bounce of the ball that decided the game.\u201d He modestly plays down the fact that Wales have made history by winning 12 consecutive Test matches. It\u2019s huddle time: The Welsh team huddle for a post-match debrief, as do their English counterparts. There\u2019s no prizes for guessing which group of players are happier. On the BBC, the commentary team and pundits are criticising England for their lack of ambition. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really get a foothold in the last 30 minutes of the game,\u201d says Owen Farrell, in his post-match interview. \u201cWe didn\u2019t lose our discipline. We made a few errors, myself included in that. We couldn\u2019t really get out of our half. We made a few mistakes and had a few calls go against us. There\u2019s a big chunk of the last part of that game where we didn\u2019t do what we could.\u201d Wales go top! After three games they have 12 points and sit proudly on top of the table, two clear of England in second. It\u2019s all over! Biggar misses the conversion but he won\u2019t sweat too much over that. The game ends with Wales winning their 12th Test match in a row. Simon Gleave, head of analysis at Gracenote, had a gem of a stat earlier - this is the 11th time in 11 attempts that Wales have beaten England at home in the Five/Six Nations in a year ending in the number \u20189\u2019. A sensational try from Wales!!! With a penalty advantage, Dan Biggar kicks the ball cross-field to the far touchline. He\u2019s aiming for Josh Adams, who out-jumps Henry Slade, next two grabs at the ball and goes to ground and wriggles over the line. Brilliant stuff from Wales. 76 min Wales 16-13 England: Ellis Genge and Brad Shields come on for England, as a Welsh player receives medical attention. 75 min Wales 16-13 England: Adam Beard does well to hold a pass from Dillon Lewis as Wales continue to dominate. Courtney Lawes is helped from the field, holding one foot off the ground and with his arms around the shoulders of two of England\u2019s backroom staff. Play carries on, with Wales winning the put-in in a scrum inside the England 22. England\u2019s game management has been dismal in this second half. 74 min Wales 16-13 England: Wales are in possession just inside the England half. Elsewhere on the pitch, Courtney Lawes is down injured and receiving treatment as play continues around him. 72 min Wales 16-13 England: A knock-on from England\u2019s Mark Wilson gives Wales the put-in near the halfway line. Dan Biggar launches the ball high, but Jack Knowell catches beautifully and bravely. 70 min Wales 16-13 England: We\u2019re set up for a thrilling final 10 minutes, as Adam Beard, who has never lost in 10 matches for Wales, takes to the field. Wales take the lead after playing the ball out wide, with Cory Hill finding a great angle to crash over after taking a pass from Dan Biggar. That\u2019s a great reward for Wales\u2019s patience in the long, long build-up to that try. Dan Biggar makes no mistake with a difficult conversion. 67 min Wales 9-13 England: Thirty phases in and Jonathan Davies plays the ball out the backs. Tom Curry is there to tackle him. Penalty advantage to Wales who continue to ramp up the pressure on England. 65 min Wales 9-13 England: Manu Tuilagi gets back to make an important tackle as Hadleigh Parkes sprints deep into England territory. Wales recycle the ball and recycle it, they\u2019re on Phase No23 and five metres from the England line. 63 min Wales 9-13 England: England win and score a penalty when Hadleigh Parkes is brought to ground in possession by Tom Curry and lies on the ball;. There\u2019s an unseemly bout of face-patting, fist-bumping and celebratory handshakes between Curry and several of his team-mates, a sight I\u2019m sure none of us want to see in the sport of rugby just because a wing forward does his job. In the England ranks, George Kruis is replaced by Joe Launchbury. 61 min Wales 9-10 England: There\u2019s a break in play as Wales change their two props. Nicky Smith and Dillon Lewis jog into action. A lot of players out there are blowing very, very hard indeed and there\u2019s still 20 minutes to go. Another substitution: Dan Biggar replaces Gareth Anscombe at out-half for Wales. 60 min Wales 9-10 England: Heart in mouth time for Wales fans as Tuilagi takes possession on halfway, breaks through two tackles and burst towards the Wales 22 before being brought down. England build patiently, going through 11 phases before Gareth Davies intercepts a pass. 58 min Wales 9-10 England: Sinckler is taken off before he\u2019s sent off and replaced by Harry Williams. 57 min Wales 9-10 England: Wales advance upfield and Sinckler gives away another penalty, this time for holding Alun Wyn Jones in a choke-hold while in a rolling maul. Jones has the good sense to catch the referee\u2019s attention and point to the arm around his neck, slowly strangling him. Sinckler is given a final warning, while Anscombe kicks Wales to within a point of England. 55 min min Wales 6-10 England: Wales win a penalty when the TMO grasses up Kyle Sinckler for a late shoulder charge on Gareth Anscombe after the Wales out-half had booted the ball upfield. He\u2019s lucky to avoid a yellow card, in my humble opinion. 54 min Wales 6-10 England: Another great catch from Williams who darts through a thicket of bodies to leap and catch a Ben Youngs kick. He\u2019s rewarded for his fine effort by a crunching tackle from Manu Tuilagi. 53 min Wales 6-10 England: A high cross-field kick from Farrell is caught well under pressure by Liam Williams. 52 min Wales 6-10 England: Anscombe curls the ball between the posts for the crucial first score of the second half. Just four points separate the sides. 51 min Wales 3-10 England: Jonny May is penalised for hanging on to the ball after a tackle and Wales have a penalty kick at goal a fair bit right of centre. Gareth Anscombe tees it up. 49 min Wales 3-10 England: Coimpared to the first half, during which the ball seemed to be constantly in play, the second has been very scrappy. Wales have the put-in, the scrum collapses and Peypar orders a reset. Wales advance to within a few yards of the England 22. 48 min Wales 3-10 England: More argy-bargy - finger-pointing, throat-grabbing and shoving - from both sets of players. Referee Jacob Peypar takes both captains to one side and tells them that if it happens again, whoever is responsible for starting the handbags will be penalised. 46 min Wales 3-10 England: More pressure on Wales deep in their own 22 as Jonny May kicks for touch. The Wales line-out has been struggling throughout this championship and England are trying to take advantage. They lose this one, but England concede a penalty for playing the arm rather than the ball. After a spot of pushing and shoving between assorted hulking bruisers, Gareth Anscombe kicks and takes play to the halfway line. 44 min Wales 3-10 England: England try to advance up the pitch, make little or no ground and quickly opt to kick rather than repeatedly go through phases without getting over the gain line. Owen Farrell sprints on to an offload from Elliot Daly, who\u2019d just been tackled, and looks as if he might be home and hosed. He\u2019s bundled into touch on the Wales 22. 41 min Wales 3-10 England: Not for the first time in this match, the England front row are moaning at referee Jacob Peypar over what they perceive to be \u201cshenanigans\u201d from their Welsh counterparts. The South African claims he\u2019s seeing no foul play and says they\u2019ll have to \u201ctrust us\u201d. 41 min: No changes in personnel on either side as Gareth Anscombe gets the second half under way. Elliot Daly leaps to take the catch for England. From our man in the anorak: \u201cIt is six years since Wales were seven points or more behind at half-time in a Six Nations home match,\u201d writes Simon Gleave, head of analysis at Gracenote. \u201cIreland led 23-3 at half-time in February 2013 but since then, Wales have never been as far behind as now at the break.\u201d The players go off for a well-earned rest after an often brutal first half. England lead by seven points after Tom Curry pounced on a loose ball and took advantage of slack Welsh defending to go over for the only try of the game. 39 min Wales 3-10 England: Youngs boots long down the touchline, spotting May, who gives Tipuric a 10 yard head start in the chip-and-chase and still beats him to the ball. He\u2019s bundled into touch and England have a line-out about five metres out from the Wales line. Mere seconds ago, they were defending for their lives under their own posts. 37 min Wales 3-10 England: Wales turn over the ball at the English scrum and gallop towards goal. England repel them and Ben Youngs kicks clear. 35 min Wales 3-10 England: Wales line-out, about 30 metres from the England line. They mess it up and England win possession and get a scrum. 31 min Wales 3-10 England: Wales are in full flow, making metres into England territory, but almost come a cropper as they switch Owen Farrell almost getting away, only to be stopped by a last-ditch tackle. 29 min Wales 3-10 England: Owen Farrell has started slowly, missing a couple of tackles and misjudging a few kicks from hand, but he puts Wales under all sorts of pressure on this occasion with a kick from deep. Wales scrum just outside their own 22. They advance up the field after good interplay between George North and Jonathan Davies. Wales in possession on the halfway line now and making metres over the gain line. Tom Curry goes over for England following a scrummage under the Wales posts. After a Courtney Lawes interception as Wales tried to clear the ball, Curry picked the ball off the ground, spotted a gap and went for it. \u201cNo guard there, no blocker in front of the ball,\u201d declares Brian Moore in the BBC commentary box. \u201cJustin Tipuric was out of position.\u201d The conversion is put over and England lead by seven. 23 min Wales 3-3 England: Advantage penalty for Wales as Gareth Anscombe kicks wide for Hadleigh Parkes to catch and try to go over, but there\u2019s too much weight on his kick. Penalty for Wales 18m from the England posts, a little to the right. Gareth Anscombe slots the ball over and it\u2019s all square. 20 min Wales 0-3 England: It\u2019s been an extremely attritional opening quarter, during which the ball has spent an awful long time in play. Wales are rewarded for their efforts with a penalty just inside the England half. Tom Curry, I think, refusing to release the ball after the tackle. Wales kick for touch and get it, halfway inside the English 22 metre area. 17 min Wales 0-3 England: Wales are penalised for collapsing the scrum, with - to this non-front-rower\u2019s untrained and uneducated eye - Rob Evans appearing to go down under pressure from Kyle Sinckler. Owen Farrell has a kick at goal straight in front of the posts and makes no mistake. 15 min Wales 0-0 England: Some industrial language from the scrummage, in a distinctly Welsh accent, as somebody roars: \u201cNo fucking freebies, come on let\u2019s go!\u201d. On the BBC commentary team, Brian Moore issues the obligatory apology to any snoflakes who might be offended, finishing up by saying: \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m apologising, I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d I would also like to apologise to anyone offended by my reporting this effing and jeffing from the front line of Six Nations rugby. 12 min Wales 0-0 England: A top-spin kick for touch deep in Wales territory by Ben Youngs sees the ball go out of play for the first time in what seems like aeons. England get a free-kick for some infringement or other by Justin Tipuric in the line-out. England are seven metres out and in control of the ball. Their hard work comes to nothing as Henry Slade runs on to a forward pass when England try to put him through with a \u201ccrash-ball\u201d. 10 min: A powerful tackle by Cory Hill on Billy Vunipola gets the crowd gasping, then there\u2019s more excitement as an Owen Farrell kick is blocked down. The bounce isn\u2019t kind for Wales and qwe find ourselves back at the halfway line, with Gareth Davies putting a high ball up, up in the air for his team-mates to chase. 9 min Wales 0-0 England: Ben Youngs hoofs clear from the scrummage and Wales full-back Liam Williams gathers before skipping through three tackles. 6 min Wales 0-0 England: Wales are forced backwards but win a line-out on the England 22. Cory Hill drives forward, then Rob Evans, before Ross Moriarty is driven backwards and England turn the ball over. They have the put-in, on their own 22. 4 min Wales 0-0 England: We\u2019re in midfield with Wales in possession and the referee spots an offside, but plays advantage. Courtney Lawes the man not living up to his name in that instance. Wales have a penalty just inside the England half and Gareth Anscombe kicks for touch, deep in the England 22. Wales line-out, 10 metres from the England line. 2 min Wales 0-0 England: A knock-on by Ben Moon in midfield and Wales get the put-in in the first scrum of the game. There\u2019s a pause as England winger Jack Knowell gets treatment for an early injury. There\u2019s a change of mind from the referee, Jacob Peypar from South Africa, who has decided - or been told - news of some non-existent no-arms tackle I failed to spot in the slow-motion replays. It\u2019s a long, long way out and Elliot Daly sends his effort well wide. On the BBC\u2019s coverage, the commentary team are bemused by the referee\u2019s decision to award that penalty. 1 min Wales 0-0 England: Owen Farrell gets the ball airborne and it\u2019s gathered by Ross Moriarty, who goes on the charge from deep inside his own half. Wales send the ball skywards, and at full-back for England, Billy Vunipola makes his first catch of the day. The teams are in the tunnel: Wales are first out of their dressing-room, led by Alun Wyn Jones. England follow soon after, with Owen Farrell leading the troops. The doors to the corridor leading down to the pitch are opened and out they march. A full houes, loud music blaring over the PA system and pyrotechnics greet their arrival and they line up for their respective anthems. Kick off is only a few minutes away. Stat-attack: \u201cFrance\u2019s 17 point victory is their biggest in the Six Nations against anyone other than Italy since they won 28-9 against Wales eight years ago,\u201d writes Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis, Gracenote. Meanwhile in Wales, the Principality Stadium crowd are raising the roof with a stirring rendition of Delilah, a heartwarming Tom Jones ditty about the cheery subject of betrayal and a domestic assault that ends in the fatal stabbing of a woman. Paris: France have snared a bonus-point win after pressing on for the necessary try for eight additional minutes: Pre-match reading In Paris: France lead Scotland 15-3 in a much-improved display (so far): The teams Wales meet England at the Principality Stadium, with both sides looking for their third straight win in this year\u2019s Championship. Victory for Wales would make it their 12th straight Test win, but in beating France and Italy in their opening two matches in this Six Nations, they have only beaten the two worst sides in the competition. Today\u2019s Test promises to be a lot more ... em, testing. Kick-off at the Principality Stadium is at 4.45pm (GMT), but stay tuned for team news and build-up.",

He reportedly helped organise the 12 February meeting with Trump. \u201cAnother key proponent of this effort was Thomas Barrack, Trump\u2019s personal friend of several decades and the chairman of his inaugural committee,\u201d the report stated. Barrack is reputedly a top Trump fundraiser with extensive contacts in the Gulf. A spokesperson said last week he was involved in the region to pursue \u201cbetter aligned Middle East and US objectives\u201d. The implications of this as-yet incomplete inquiry are wide-ranging \u2013 and grim. The nuclear scheme appears to provide further evidence of attempts to monetise the Trump presidency and of possible conflicts of interest and corruption. If the sale goes ahead, Iran, whose 2015 agreement to limit nuclear activities was repudiated by Trump last year, may refuse to exercise continued self-restraint. Other Middle East countries could follow, ultimately fuelling a nuclear arms race. A clear risk exists that the international counter-proliferation apparatus, already damaged by US-Russian scrapping of arms control treaties, may be further undermined by American double standards. The \u201cnukes-to-Saudi\u201d affair may also help explain why Trump exculpated Salman\u2019s regime over its murder of the journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, and has ignored Saudi atrocities in Yemen and other abuses. As they say in New York business circles, he has skin in the game.",

The leaders Lincoln ended a frustrating run of four consecutive draws with a 2-0 win over Morecambe. Mansfield stay in third after winning 1-0 at home to fellow promotion contenders Forest Green, with Tyler Walker scoring the winning goal before being sent off, while MK Dons were 2-0 winners over Newport. At the bottom, Notts County were beaten 1-0 at Tranmere, while Sol Campbell\u2019s Macclesfield Town conceded a late equaliser at Crawley.",

It is the poorest people who face the biggest risks from the economic uncertainty posed by Brexit, the archbishop of Canterbury said on Saturday, and the prayers are likely to focus on reconciliation and the needs of those most vulnerable. Justin Welby told the Church of England\u2019s General Synod: \u201cWe cannot ignore the warnings that have been proffered about the possible profound impact that the next months may possibly have on the poorest of our society. \u201cWe must be ready for any difficulties and uncertainties, and not allow any destructive forces to create further divisions in our society. \u201cIt is true that no predictions on the economy are certain.

That is not currently the way we are going.\u201d If attention was not paid to the \u201cpain and exclusion\u201d of some parts of society revealed by Brexit, greater division and strife would result, Welby said in a debate on the state of the nation. The church must be a peacemaker \u201cto play our part in uniting our country and to put the most vulnerable at the centre of national life\u201d. He told the synod: \u201cHow we recover from and heal these divisions may be the biggest challenge that lies ahead of us \u2013 to unify as a country, to have a healthy and functioning democracy, and to have a strong ethically and morally based economy that works for all.\u201d The burdens on political leaders were enormous, he said. \u201cIt is easy to stand on the sidelines and judge.

It said divisions within the major political parties were \u201cstifling the emergence of a hopeful and viable vision for the common good in our communities\u201d. Before the vote, John Sentamu, the archbishop of York, led the synod in a prayer asking God to \u201csave our parliamentary democracy\u201d and \u201cprotect the high court of parliament and all its members from partiality and prejudice\u201d. Welby said last month that a no-deal Brexit would be \u201cnot only a political and practical failure, but a moral one\u201d. Welby voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, but has since stressed the need for reconciliation and restraint. Earlier on Saturday, the synod called on the government to take action on advertising by the gambling industry, and impose a levy on it to pay for research and treatment. Children were being groomed by pervasive advertising \u201crelentlessly promoting\u201d gambling, said Alan Smith, the bishop of St Albans.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sadie-jones\" title=\"\">Sadie Jones</a> is the author of four novels, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/26/sadie-jones-small-wars-review\" title=\"\"><em>Small Wars</em></a> and the award-winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/10/fiction.orangeprizeforfiction\" title=\"\"><em>The Outcast</em></a>. Her new book, <em>The Snakes</em>, is a dark thriller about the corrosive effect of money, greed and abuse on a wealthy London family.</p> <p><strong><em>The Snakes</em> is the first book you\u2019ve set in the present day. Did you feel a need to write a \u201cway we live now\u201d novel?</strong><br>I was hoping not to. The idea of training a lens on the way we live and think now is daunting to me. I prefer to come at things sideways rather than right on the nose in capital letters. In many ways, the book is a morality tale and a story about what felt \u2013 when I was writing it in 2016 \u2013 and still feels like the rise of evil. I thought about setting it between the wars, because good people were caught up in evil times then, too. But I decided it had to be set today because of this feeling I have of being on a precipice, this feeling that mortal danger is all around us.</p> <p><strong>Why </strong><strong>set it partly in France?</strong><br>I love France, and it symbolises old Europe for me. It\u2019s civilised, and with Brexit coming, there\u2019s a nostalgia for that. So I wanted the book to feel post-European, like a goodbye to all that we\u2019re leaving behind. I wanted to put it somewhere that feels like it\u2019s dying.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I loved CS Lewis, Frances Hodgson Burnett and those very moral Victorian novels.

So for Christmas they got me this book of pictures of her, which was such a sweet gesture. They did it to tease me because she\u2019s my girl-crush, but it was just a very lovely thing too.</p> <p><strong>How do you organise your books? Are they alphabetised?</strong><br>Not at all. They\u2019re all just muddled up.

So for Christmas they got me this book of pictures of her, which was such a sweet gesture. They did it to tease me because she\u2019s my girl-crush, but it was just a very lovely thing too. How do you organise your books? Are they alphabetised? Not at all. They\u2019re all just muddled up. One thing I do have is the shelf of shame, of books I meant to read, that were recommended to me, and I haven\u2019t read and should have. Which book would you give to a young person? I recently gave my daughter Normal People, by Sally Rooney, but she doesn\u2019t count as a young person, does she? She\u2019s just turned 22. With young children, I try to give them books that seem to describe them in some way, so they\u2019ll be able to see themselves. I think that\u2019s what hooks you in. What book might people be surprised to see on your bookshelves? Jilly Cooper\u2019s Riders. It\u2019s one of the best books ever, I just love it. People are really snobby about Jilly Cooper but she knows what she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s so accurate about people, and she\u2019s so funny. I\u2019d stand up for Jilly any time. \u2022 The Snakes by Sadie Jones is published by Vintage (\u00a314.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Follow it all live, with the estimable Scott Murray, right here: Goals-from-corners news: \u201cElvir Balji\u0107 used to score from corner kicks a little before he became Real Madrid\u2019s record signing back in 1999,\u201d writes \u00d6nder Susam. \u201cGood times.\u201d K\u00e1ri Tulinius: \u201cThe term \u2018Olympic goal\u2019, for scoring directly from a corner, comes from when Argentina played the reigning 1924 Olympic champions Uruguay and a goal was scored directly from a corner.\u201d And it\u2019s all over in Seville, where Luis Suarez\u2019s 93rd-minute goal ensured a rollercoaster game ended in Barcelona\u2019s favour, 4-2. But the story, as ever, is about the majesty of Messi. Absurdly, today\u2019s hat-trick was the 50th of his career, and I can tell you that each goal was a peach: a crisp left-foot volley, then a right-foot piledriver and finally a vintage-Messi dink over a prone keeper. League Two: Lincoln, Bury and Mansfield all win, and they remain the division\u2019s top three in that order. Macclesfield snatch a draw from the jaws of victory at Crawley and Notts County take nothing home from Tranmere. Yeovil beat Cambridge to climb out of the drop zone. League One: More cruelty at Wimbledon, where a stoppage-time goal from Igor Vetokele seals a comeback win for Charlton. Plymouth put five past Rochdale, Shrewsbury get a shock win at Peterborough, Portsmouth and Barnsley draw a blank. Championship: Full-time whistles sound across the division. No late twists, apart from the cruel late goal at Wigan. Norwich and Leeds both win in narrow and dramatic fashion, Hull take a tonking at Brentford. \u2026and it\u2019s 3-2 to Barcelona at Sevilla, who twice led. Five minutes left. A penalty apiece, a point apiece, and by all account a farcical final few minutes, featuring unexpected sprinkler action. Championship: And there it is \u2013 Doomed Ipswich concede the inevitable equaliser, in the first minute of stoppage time, at Wigan. Joe Garner the scorer. Rondon scores, Almiron impresses, and all is well \u2013 for now \u2013 at St James\u2019. Huddersfield, however, are sadly finished. Championship: Said Benrahma completes his hat-trick against Hull to put Brentford 5-1 up. Danny Graham and Che Adam enjoy a quickfire exchange of goals at St Andrew\u2019s, where it\u2019s 2-2, and Semi Ajayi draws Rotherham level in the six-pointer at Reading \u2026 and Doomed Ipswich still lead at Wigan. League Two: Jay O\u2019Shea rattles in his 16th of the season, and Bury have turned it around \u2013 they\u2019ve 2-1 ahead against Paul Scholes\u2019 Oldham. They won\u2019t go top today \u2013 leaders Lincoln are 2-0 up \u2013 but Bury\u2019s promotion push continues. A penalty apiece on the south coast. And then there\u2019s another one! Which shouldn\u2019t have been given! Which Josh King misses! More on the goals-from-corners party piece: Championship: Goals! Two of them: Norwich and Leeds both go ahead within seconds of each other. First Kenny McLean makes it 3-2 at Carrow Road \u2013 comeback kings and all that \u2013 before a messy goal from Ezgjan Alioski at Elland Road puts Bielsa\u2019s side 2-1 up. There follows a mass-scuffle, which concludes with Bolton manager Phil Parkinson being sent off. Bravo. Albert Adomah equalises for Aston Villa at Stoke. Europe: All over in Munich, where Bayern inch past Hertha Berlin, 1-0, to go level on points with Dortmund. Still 2-1 in Seville, where Ousmane Dembele has been thrown on for Barcelona. \u201cAhem,\u201d writes Kieran Malone, \u201cSteve Staunton also scored a goal against norn iron straight from a corner.\u201d He did indeed \u2013 and it was the go-to party trick of Morten Gamst Pedersen, right? Any more for any more? Championship: The Carrow Road crowd have seen some fine games this season and are being treated to another helter-skelter thriller today: Ben Godfrey has made it 2-2 against Bristol City. Leeds still being held by Bolton, Bamford missing a wonderful chance from close-range. Brent are now 4-1 to the good at home to Hull, Neal Maupay inevitably getting in on the fun. A division below, Omar Bogle has missed a penalty in the big one at Fratton Park. League One: Aiden McGeady doubles Sunderland\u2019s lead at Bristol Rovers, Anthony O\u2019Connor makes it 2-2 for Bradford against 10-man Walsall and Mouhamadou-Naby Sarr levels for Charlton at rock-bottom Wimbledon. Charlie Mulgrew has bent one directly in from a corner (also known as \u201can Artim Shaqiri\u201d), to equalise for Blackburn at Birmingham. It\u2019s the third time he\u2019s pulled that off this season \u2013 ridiculous. It is indeed. Salomon Rondon, a truly glorious centre-forward, turns provider to flick into the path of Ayoze Perez, who makes the points safe for Newcastle. The Venezuelan colossus finishes through Jonas Lossl\u2019s legs to put the Magpies ahead. That\u2019s Huddersfield dead and buried, isn\u2019t it. League Two: Goals at a premium. Your half-time scores look like this: League One: Sunderland are ahead at Memorial Stadium thanks to Luke O\u2019Nien, while the tabletop meeting between Portsmouth and Barnsley remains deadlocked. Other half-time scores are as follows: Europe: Huff, puff, and a 64th-minute Javi Mart\u00ednez header. Bayern Munich 1-0 Hertha Berlin, with the Bavarian giants, as it stands, level on points with Borussia Dortmund at the top of the Bundesliga. Freiburg are 4-1 up against Augsburg, Mainz 1-0 up against Schalke and Monchengladbach leading Wolfburg 2-0. In Spain, Gabriel Mercado has restored Sevilla\u2019s lead against Barcelona \u2013 2-1. \u201cNot a huge fan of his so I should be questioning the \u2018King\u2019 part, not the \u2018Solomon\u2019,\u201d writes David Smith, \u201cbut in his case Sol is short for Sulzeer not Solomon\u201d \u2013 a very good point and duly corrected. Championship: Grizzled veteran Steven Fletcher puts Sheffield Wednesday 3-0 up at home to Swansea, whose joie de vivre of last week has deserted them. And Said Benrahma has got another goal at Griffin Park. All in all an eventful 45 minutes in the second tier, where your half-time scores look like this: Europe: In Spain, Jesus Navas (the very same) puts Sevilla ahead against Barcelona, but That Man Lionel Messi equalises four minutes later. 1-1. Half an hour to play in Munich, where Bayern are yet to find a way past Hertha Berlin. League Two: A header from Harry Smith puts Sol Campbell\u2019s Macclesfield ahead at Crawley \u2013 that takes them out of the drop zone. Helluva job so far from King Sulzeer. Championship: Goals galore. The floodgates have opened at the Riverside as Ashley Fletcher puts Boro 2-0 up against QPR, Kenny McLean equalises for Norwich a full minute before Callum O\u2019Dowda restores Bristol City\u2019s lead, Preston are three to the good at Millwall with half an hour gone, a wondergoal from Sa\u00efd Benrahma has turned Brentford-Hull on its head \u2013 that one is now 2-1 \u2013 and 10-man, bottom-of-the-table, definitely-doomed Ipswich are ahead at Wigan thanks to a Will Keane penalty. They couldn\u2019t, could they\u2026? League Two: Just the five goals so far, the most notable of which is Bruno Andrade\u2019s for Lincoln at Morecambe. League One: Wimbledon lead Charlton thanks Michael Folivi \u2013 a messy goal, but they\u2019ll take it. They remain rock bottom but are giving themselves every chance of survival with a mettlesome run of recent form. This would make it three wins on the trot. Other scores as follows: Championship: Leeds\u2019 imperious reign at the top of the table lasted precisely six minutes. Mark Beevers has levelled for Bolton. Up in Wigan, Ipswich\u2019s Season of Despair continues apace with a Jonas Knudsen sending off. And a powerful header from Fraizer Campbell has put Hull 1-0 up at Brentford. Huddersfield\u2019s captain is giving his marching orders for a heavy tackle on Almiron. As far as Newcastle are concerned, a must-win game has just become a really-must-win-or-else game. Championship: Two big goals at the top of the table. Jamie Paterson has put Unrelenting Bristol City 1-0 up at Norwich (who, as you may be aware, are the division comeback kings). And a Patrick Bamford penalty gives Leeds the lead against Bolton \u2013 they\u2019ve leapfrogged Norwich to go first as it stands. Elsewhere Preston have gone 2-0 up thanks to Tom Clarke and Che Adams gets his 20th goal of the season to put Birmingham ahead against Blackburn. Joshua King slams home from the spot after being brought down by Joao Moutinho. Championship: Jonny Howson has put Middlesbrough 1-0 up against QPR, and you wouldn\u2019t bet against the scoreline staying that way \u2013 no one in the top half have scored fewer than Boro, and no one in the entire division has conceded fewer. Stoke are ahead against Aston Villa thanks to Sam Vokes, Preston are beating Millwall and a peach from Adam Reach has put Sheffield Wednesday in front against Swansea. They triumph 4-2 on penalties, Karen Bardsley the hero with two saves in the shootout. More here: In League One\u2019s early kickoff, sixth-placed Doncaster have only managed a 1-1 draw at Scunthorpe \u2013 which means Peterborough can leapfrog them into the play-off places by beating Shrewsbury. Arsenal v Manchester City finishes at an impasse, and will be decided by the lottery exacting, high-pressure examination of technique that is a penalty shootout. Follow it here with Rob Smyth: So, Miguel Almiron gets his full debut for Newcastle. He looked a livewire off the bench against Wolves, exactly the sort of energetic, free-jazz type that Rafael Benitez\u2019s side have been desperately lacking. Knowing Rafa as we do, it may be wise not to expect to see too much of Almiron away from home, but today\u2019s game \u2013 a must-win home game against the bottom side \u2013 is a tailor-made debut. He plays alongside both Salomon Rondon and Ayoze Perez in what is, by Benitez\u2019s standards, a full-on gung-ho attacking lineup.

They\u2019ll have played a game more, and they\u2019ll need a seven-goal win to get there, but equally they have lost once since mid-November and today \u2013 nay, right now \u2013 face midtable Hertha at the Allianz Arena. File under \u201cstranger things have happened\u201d. For an object lesson in runaway-leaderdom, Dortmund should look to Spain, where Barcelona can sail 10 points clear with a win this afternoon. The only problem is that they\u2019re away at Sevilla, who are not only Really Quite Good, but will also be intent of wresting back fourth spot after Getafe\u2019s earlier win. Stay tuned. League Two After a win, a draw and a loss from his first three games with Oldham, Paul Scholes looks to instil consistency \u2013 and close in on the play-offs \u2013 with a local derby against Bury. Scholes\u2019 opponents will be no pushovers: Bury could end the day top of the table. The current leaders, Lincoln, travel to Morecambe. Two other promotion hopefuls face off as Colchester host Carlisle, and Sol Campbell continues his attempts to dig Macclesfield out of danger at Crawley. Notts County, the division\u2019s bottom side and a point below Campbell\u2019s men, are are at Tranmere, where they\u2019ll be tasked with keeping a lid on the free-scoring James Norwood. League One With leaders Luton not playing until tomorrow, second-placed Barnsley have a chance to close the gap to two points this afternoon. To do so they\u2019ll need to win at Fratton Park \u2013 no easy task, though Portsmouth, five points clear on New Year\u2019s Day and now 10 points off the leaders, are in wretched form. At the other end of the table, with seven points \u201cseparating\u201d the bottom eight and four relegation spots to go round, the annual mad scramble has well and truly begun. To that end Wimbledon will be hoping to redirect the buoyancy of their FA Cup run, which came to an end last weekend, into the task of clambering off the bottom of the league. They host Charlton, while the three teams above them \u2013 all on 33 points \u2013 are away from home. And that\u2019s that. Spurs have done wonders in recent months to cling doggedly to the coat-tails of the top two, but the last-ditch heroics that delivered so many of their wins meant doubts lingered over how sustainable a title tilt truly was. And there were no such heroics today. They could finish the weekend eight points off the league leaders. Burnley, meanwhile, have turned a miserable season fully around \u2013 and that result will not be welcomed at Newcastle, who will stay below Sean Dyche\u2019s side today whatever happens. More coverage and reaction here: Championship A big day in a division that is delectably tight at the top.

A defeat, on the other hand, would be Very Bad Indeed for a club where doom-mongering has become close to second nature. There\u2019s also some football happening as we speak. That\u2019d be Tottenham\u2019s trip to Burnley \u2013 the title outsiders having just dragged it back to 1-1 at Turf Moor through a certain Harold Kane. There\u2019s 15 minutes to go and you\u2019ll get updates here \u2013 though feel free to keep abreast via Scott Murray\u2019s dedicated live blog: Are you by any chance averse to egg-chasing and the pointy-shoed fairweather enthusiasts, crude of manner and loud of voice, who invade our favourite pubs at this time of year? Then welcome one and all to this distinctly mild-mannered live blog, where there will be no aggressive downing of pints, no roaringly performative patriotism, and the only goalposts that matter are precisely 2.44 meters tall. Because despite what you might have been told, there is football to be had this afternoon \u2013 plenty of it. In the top flight we\u2019ve got a best-of-the-rest meeting and an old-fashioned gloves-off scrap, while each of the the 72 Football League clubs are turning into the season\u2019s home straight with some mixture of ambition, misery, determination, terror, despair, yearning, angst and apathy. I\u2019ll talk you through all that in a minute. Get the kettle on.",

      "bodyText": "Stat-attack: \u201cFrance\u2019s 17 point victory is their biggest in the Six Nations against anyone other than Italy since they won 28-9 against Wales eight years ago,\u201d writes Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis, Gracenote. Baptiste Serin scores the conversion with the final kick of the game and it\u2019s all over at the Stade de France. It was a very impressive performance and victory for France, who scored four tries and had several more disallowed en route to victory. Scotland huffed and puffed but were ultimately too error-prone, not clinical enough and far too toothless up front. 80+8 min France 25-10 Scotland: France drive repeatedly at the Scotland line and Gregory Alldritt goes over once again. 80+7 min: France 20-10 Scotland: The clock ticks on, with both teams looking for a bonus point. France have the ball on the Scottish line and look to have possibly gone over - Nic Berry signals for the TMO. Gregory Alldritt was in possession ... but the try is disallowed for double movement. France have another try disallowed. That\u2019s three-and-a-half, if not four, the TMO has diddled them out of. France scrum on the Scottish five-metre line. 80+4 min France 20-10 Scotland: Fail to find it, because they weren\u2019t looking for it - they want a bonus point try. 80+2 min France 20-10 Scotland: Scotland get to within four metres of the France line, but French resistance is stout. We\u2019re on Phase 20. We\u2019ll have no more, as Nic Berry blows for a France penalty. Actually scrap that - France play the ball long down the field and don\u2019t manage to put it into touch. 80 min France 20-10 Scotland: Scotland plug on, but make little ground. They\u2019re still on the France 22 in Phase 12 of the game\u2019s final play. 80 min France 20-10 Scotland: Scotland have the ball on the France 22 as the 80 minutes elapse and the clock turns scarlet. 78 min France 20-3 Scotland: An uncharacteristically delighted French crowd strike up a rousing rendition of La Marseillaise which comes to a very abrupt end as Scotland score a long overdue try straight from the kick-off. Ali Price slides between the post after Scotland had taken dvantage of a wonderful kick-off by Blair Kinghorn. Even I\u2019d score that conversion and the extra two points are duly added. 75 min France 20-3 Scotland: France win their own scrum and look for the shove, driving towards the French line. Over they go, twisting and driving, with replacement No8 Gregory Alldritt picking the ball from his own feet and touching down. Baptiste Serin puts his conversion wide. 73 min France 15-3 Scotland: Five-metre scrum for France as they look to have been stopped inches short of the Scotland line. Gael Fikou claims his team have grounded the ball and it\u2019s sent upstairs to the TMO. Ritchie had the ball and was shoved backwards over his own line and grounds the ball at the bottom of a ruck before the ball is engulfed in assorted French hands. That\u2019s the third \u201ctry\u201d France have had disallowed now. 71 min France 15-3 Scotland: Blair Kinghorn gallops into space and looks around for support before getting swamped by three French defenders. France have emptied their bench too but are looking very leggy. 70 min France 15-3 Scotland: There\u2019s a bit of pushing and shoving between both sets of players, which prompts referee Nic Berry to tell both captains to tell their teams to behave themselves. This, meanwhile, from our anorak-wearing man, Simon Gleave, at Gracenote: \u201cFrance have failed to win on six of the last eight occasions that they have held a half-time lead in an international match, losing five and drawing one,\u201d he says. 69 min France 15-3 Scotland: Unlike his footballing namesake, Will, Scotland centre Nick Grigg is not on fire. He runs into Yoann Huget, who strips him of possession and ruins a promising Scotland move in the process. 68 min France 15-3 Scotland: Brilliant play from Adam Hastings, who goers on a weaving run through the centre for Scotland, who find themselves within 10 metres of the French line. 66 min France 15-3 Scotland: France penalty after Grant Gilchrist fails to roll away from a tackle. Romain Ntamack puts in a massive clearance with a kick from the hand. 64 min France 15-3 Scotland: France play it out wide and Nick Grigg puts in a brilliant tackle on Gael Fickou, before Adam Hastings wins a penalty under his own posts. Scotland use the break in play to empty their bench and bring on their six remaining substitutes. 63 min France 15-3 Scotland: Basteraud charges for the line, but is tackled a couple of metres short. Scotland are buckling under some extreme French pressure, here. Picamoles drives forward into a wall of Scottish resistance about three metres out. 61 min France 15-3 Scotland: Selfish play from Yoann Huget, who eschews several opportunities to pass to team-mates who could have waltzed over the Scottish line. He\u2019s brought to ground a feew yards from the line and France win a penalty when a Scottish forward goes off his feet at the ruck. Five-metre scrum for France. 59 min France 15-3 Scotland: Adam Hastings, still on the field at out-half with Peter Horne at inside centre after Sam Johnson was substituted, sends a wonderful kick in behind the the French backline, prompting a bout of bickering between Thomas Ramos and Yoann Huget over who should have chased it. 55 min France 15-3 Scotland: Sean Maitland finds himself in possession on the touchline, galloping towards the French line. He\u2019s tackled a few yards short and France clear their lines. Scotland line-out on the France 22. Scotland give away possession cheaply again, however, when Tommy Seymour knocks on. Ben Toolis has just replaced Jonny Gray in the Scottish second row. 53 min France 15-3 Scotland: Peter Horne, who had been off for a head injury assessment, returns to action. Adam Hastings had been covering for him. 52 min France 15-3 Scotland: Scotland get quick ball out to the left touchline and Kinghorn chips and chases, only to be beaten to the ball by Wenceslas Lauret. He\u2019d knocked on in the build-up, so it wouldn\u2019t have counted anyway. 50 min France 15-3 Scotland: There\u2019s a break in play as Scotland winger Tommy Seymour receives treatment for an injury to his left wrist, which he injured while putting in a tackle. He\u2019s passed fit to continue for now, despite looking in extreme discomfort. 49 min France 15-3 Scotland: \u201cUSE! USE!\u201d shouts referee Nic Berry as French scrum-half Antoine Dupont stands behind a ruck wondering what to do with the ball. 44 min France 15-3 Scotland: Brilliant airborne take from Damian Pernaud a few yards in front of the Scottish line, the winger beating two Scotsmen to pluck an excellent Ntamack kick in behind from the sky. That\u2019s outstanding. 45 min France 15-3 Scotland: Apologies for flashing up an incorrect score in the previous entry. Scotland are in possession just outside their own 22, but cede possession when Sam Johnson passes forward. His mistake in such a dangerous area earns him a rollocking from his skipper, Greig Laidlaw. 44 min France 15-3 Scotland: That was a marvellous try, featuring strong running, several excellent offloads, a charge and a delightful chip-and-gather from Mathieu Basteraud before Huget went over. Scotland\u2019s only touch of the ball in this half before France scored was their own kick-off. France pick-up where they left off, coming from their own 22 to go over the Scottish line, with Yoann Huget finishing a wonderful team move. Thomas Ramos fails to add the extras, hitting the post. 41 min: Scotland kick off with a seven-point gap to close. Wenceslas Lauret rises to take the catch from Blair Kinghorn\u2019s drop-kick. \u201cHalf-time, boys,\u201d announces referee Nic Berry after a shrill blast on his whistle as the ball bounces out of play near the halway line. France have dominated, showing flashes of their former selves with a wonderful counter-attacking 40 min France 10-3 Scotland: A period of sustained French pressure, in which they made no ground whatsoever, comes to an end almost exactly where it started after Sebastien Vahaamahina knocks on as he stretches to catch a pass. Scotland scrum on their own 22 and the clock is in the red zone. 37 min France 10-3 Scotland: Guilhem Guirado is back on for France. Winger Yoann Huget, whose spell on the Naughty Step is finished, also returns to the field. France put-in, just outside the Scotland 22. 36 min France 10-3 Scotland: Scotland win a cheap penalty for offside and Blair Kinghorn kicks for touch. Scotland line-out just inside the French 22. Wenceslas Lauret steals the ball and another opportunity is wasted by Scotland as they throw long. 34 min France 10-3 Scotland: Down to 14 men for another two minutes, France lead by seven points and have missed one easy(ish) penalty and had two tries disallowed. That\u2019s a potential 17 points they\u2019ve left behind them so far \u2013 a sign of their dominance, but will they be punished for their carelessness? 32 min France 10-3 Scotland: A woeful penalty kick from Thomas Ramos leaves the scoreboard operator with nothing to do, but in better news from France, their captain is back from his HIA and looks like he\u2019s been given the all clear to continue. 30 min France 10-3 Scotland: Gael Fikou goes over, latching on to a wonderfully timed chip-kick under pressure from Romain Ntamack. TMO Rowan Kitt, a rosbif by nationality and bound to be unpopular with the home crowd, spots another knock-on in the build-up and the try is disallowed. That\u2019s a shame, because it was another beauty. 28 min France 10-3 Scotland: The referee is as good as his word and Yoann Huget is sin-binned for going in the wrong side of a ruck, paying the price for the earlier indiscretions of his team-mates. His skipper, meanwhile, is sent for a head injury assessment. With a shake of his head Guirado jogs off the pitch and down the tunnel. I\u2019m surprised he wasn\u2019t sent immediately after receiving treatment a few minutes ago, to be honest. I\u2019m no doctor, but I suspect that may be the last we see of Monsieur Guirado in this game. Camille Chat is on in his place. 25 min France 10-3 Scotland Scotland penalty after Basteraud comes in from the side moments after making a tackle. The ref warns Guirado that the next French player to do this will be sent to the sin-bin and Greig Laidlaw slots the ball over to get Scotland on the scoreboard. 24 min France 10-0 Scotland Guirado, who has been inspirational for France so far, is passed fit to continue and takes his place for a scrum on the French 22. Scotland have the put-in. 24 min France 10-0 Scotland: Simon Berghan tries to make ground up the right touchline but is brought down. There\u2019s a break in play for treatment to French captain and hooker Guillhem Guirado, who has shipped a Scottish hip to the head and looks to be in a bit of trouble. 23 min France 10-0 Scotland: Peter Horne breaks through the French defence and Scotland play the ball out wide out to Grant Gilchrist on the side line. The ball comes back inside and Horne take a massive hit from Guirado that prompts an intake of breath from those in the stands. Fair play to Horn, he held on to the ball and got back to his feet immediately. Scotland have a penalty in a kickable position, but Greg Laidlaw hits the post . France react quickest and make ground to the halfway line. 19 min France 10-0 Scotland Scotland win a penalty inside their own half after Demba Bamba handles illegally in a ruck. Horne kicks for the French ten metre line. 17 min: France 10-0 Scotland Completely in control of this game, France win another penalty in front of the Scottish posts after Blair Kinghorn refuses to release the ball after retrieving the ball under pressure from a French kick-and-chase. Thomas Ramos slots the ball over. A brilliant counter-attacking try by France, who scythe through the Scotland defence with a glorious running move. Th0omas Ramos, Damian Pernaud and Antoine Dupont were all heavily involved as they built from deep, with Pernaud taking a massive hit from Nick Grigg as he offloaded to Dupont. Up in support, Ntamack touched down under the posts and the bonus points are duly added. 12 min: France 0-0 Scotland: France go through the phases - eight so far - to go within seven metres of the Scotland line. Excellent defending by Scotland, who win a penalty and another chance to clear their lines. Great running by Basteraud there, running at the heart of the Scottish defence like an angry bull. 10 min France 0-0 Scotland: France on the front foot and Sean Maitland takes a ferocious thump from Damian Pernaud, who flattens him as he barges through him. France win a penalty and kick for touch, with Demba Bamba snatching the ball from the air. France are dominating proceedings here. 9 min France 0-0 Scotland: Laidlaw passes deep to Kinghorn, who boots clear from the five-metre scrum. It\u2019s a fine clearance by the full-back. TMO: Referee Nic Berry consults with his TMO, Rowan Kitt, looking for a possible knock-on in the build-up to the try. He spots one!!! Five yard scrum and Scotland have the put-in. 7 min France 5-0 Scotland: Gael Fikou and Mathieu Basteraud are stopped just short of the Scottish line after a great chip kick. After a great off-load that suck in two Scottish defenders, the ball\u2019s played out wide to French prop Jefferson Poirot, who goes over in the corner despite a challenge from Greig Laidlaw 5 min France 0-0 Scotland: Scotland have possession and are trying to advance up the pitch, ruck after ruck, breakdown after breakdown. Nick Grigg loses it and France are back in possession just outside the Scottish 22. 3 min France 0-0 Scotland: Scotland\u2019s rolling maul is illegallly dragged to the ground, earning them the opportunity to clear their lines from the penalty. Play resumes in the middle of the park, with Scotland in possession. A box kick from Laidlaw is chased by Jamie Ritchie, but France full-back leaps highest to catch cleanly. 2 min: France 0-0 Scotland: Scotland kick for touch but France win the line-out, stealing possession. Antoine Dupont makes good yards for France, who win a line-out about five yards from the Scotland line. France don\u2019t contest the line-out, opting to try to drive for the line. It doesn\u2019t work \u2013 Scotland get their maul on and drive the French pack up the pitch. 1 min France 0-0 Scotland: On the whistle of former scrum-half turned referee Nic Berry, France get the ball airborne with outside-half Romain Ntamack doing the honours. Sean Maitland catches and takjes a big hit and Scotland win a penalty when several over-enthusiastic French players come in from the side. Kick-off is just a couple of minutes away: Following stirring renditions of Flower of Scotland and La Marseillaise, the very last of the pre-match formalities are under way. Play will begin very shortly. Here\u2019s hoping for a good one ... The teams are in the tunnel ... and out they march on to the Stade de France sward, to an enthusiastic welcome from the 80,000 French supporters who haven\u2019t lost faith in their team. There are pyrotechnics and cheesy Europop galore, while the supporters wave their standard issue tricolours. Today\u2019s match officials Referee: Nic Berry (Australia) Touch judges: Nigel Owens (Wales) and Andrew Brace (Ireland) TMO: Rowan Kitt (England) From Stuart Bathgate\u2019s match preview: Of the Scotland team\u2019s key quartet, only the captain, Greig Laidlaw, is in the squad, Finn Russell having joined Stuart Hogg and Willem Nel on the injury list this week. Factor in other absentees such as Huw Jones,, Ryan Wilson and Hamish Watson, and it may seem that this game is France\u2019s to lose. But that also appeared to be the case at half-time in their last home game, before they went on to surrender a 16-0 lead to Wales. \u201cGiven such an ignominious collapse was followed by a heavy defeat at Twickenham, it is evident self-belief is in short supply in the French ranks, as Jacques Brunel implied when asked if, by naming his team two days early, he were not giving the Scots an advantage. \u201cAfter seeing our performance against England, Scotland must be pretty confident anyway,\u201d the head coach said. One of the worst French teams in living memory host injury-ravaged Scotland with both teams in dire need of a win. France have lost both their opening matches, the most recent defeat being an extremely heavy one at Twickenham. Now on his third full-back in as many matches, France coach Jacques Brunel has made four changes and several positional switches, completely revamping his backline in the process.

The TMO denied them a try four times but the home side were not only determined to win; they wanted a bonus point and played until the eighth minute of overtime to secure that fourth try. They could have had it much, much earlier.</p> \n<p>It is still difficult, though, to know what to make of them. Proclaimed in some quarters as the worst French side ever seen after their annihilation at Twickenham in round two, they burst into this contest rather as they had against Wales in round one before that record-breaking implosion. They crossed Scotland\u2019s tryline three times in the first half, playing rugby of the gods, but only one of them was to stand for a relatively modest 10-3 lead at the break.</p> \n<p>The one they scored was spectacular, originating from their own 22, whence Thomas Ramos, one of the new generation France are feeding into their team, ran with devilry. It was a big day for the 23-year-old Toulouse full-back, invested with the kicking duties after France\u2019s more mature half-back pairing of Morgan Parra and Camille Lopez, both goal-kickers, had been cleared out after their lacklustre start to the championship.

A fabulous Nick Grigg tackle cut him down short but Ramos fed a fourth reason for French hope, this the youngest of the lot, 19-year-old Romain Ntamack, son of Emile, and he finished off what will prove one of the tries of the championship.</p> \n<p>This was the first half of their match against Wales, and then some. Those two disallowed tries would have been beauties as well, featuring charging, off-loading tight forwards in concert with those brilliant backs and a back row always on hand.

Speaking at a rally in Anna Soubry\u2019s Broxtowe constituency, he said he was sad some MPs had left, but that he had no intention of changing the policies that delivered the biggest increase in the Labour vote since 1945. In a campaign-style address, the Labour leader restated a series of policies, such as raising corporation tax to fund free education, and elaborated on the party\u2019s plans to end the gender pay gap, saying that the Labour movement was the greatest force for progressive change the UK had ever known. The event is likely to be seen as a thinly veiled demand for the MPs that resigned from Labour and the Conservatives this week to hold byelections. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that a small number of Labour MPs have decided to leave our party and join forces with disaffected Tories, who say they have no problem with austerity that has plunged thousands into desperate poverty and insecurity,\u201d he said. \u201cOur programme for change won huge support in the general election because we offered hope, instead of the same old establishment demand for cuts, privatisation and austerity. \u201cThat\u2019s why we now back public ownership of the utilities and railways, why we now oppose tuition fees and corporate giveaways, and why we\u2019re no longer afraid to ask the rich to pay their fair share of tax.\u201d Paying tribute to the children who went on strike this month in protest against inaction on climate change, Corbyn said that in government he would bring back the \u201cfamily of local schools\u201d and reverse many of the reforms since 2010 that had led schools run by local authorities to become academies. \u201cThey were condemned by Tory ministers because they said they should have been studying ... they should be working, they shouldn\u2019t be doing all that,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I simply say to them is \u2018thank you for educating all of us that day.\u201d Corbyn was joined at the rally by some of his key cabinet allies, including the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, and the shadow justice minister Gloria De Piero.

      "body": "<p>Central banks are getting twitchy. On average, recessions have come along once a decade since the mid-1970s and the nadir of the last downturn occurred almost a decade ago.</p> <p>The Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman has predicted that there will be a recession in America by the time Donald Trump comes up for re-election at the end of next year.</p> <p>The darkening outlook for global growth is putting pressure on the US president to resolve his <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/21/us-china-outline-of-deal-to-end-trade-war-reuters.html\" title=\"\">trade dispute</a> with China. When the White House announced its first tranche of protectionist measures almost a year ago, hopes were high that the world economy had at last shrugged off the long hangover from the financial crisis and deep slump of 2008-09. In the months before Trump went toe-to-toe with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, it was expanding strongly and the International Monetary Fund was talking about a synchronised upturn. A year later \u2013 and with the 1 March deadline for a fresh round of US tariffs fast approaching \u2013 the mood has changed. All of which raises three big questions:</p> <h2>1. What is happening to the global economy?</h2> <p>Official statistics in the US have been delayed as a result of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/25/shutdown-latest-news-trump-reopens-government-deal-democrats\" title=\"\">federal government shutdown, </a>but when the figures for growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 are finally released this week, they are expected to show that the world\u2019s biggest economy has joined in a slowdown that is affecting Europe, China and a slew of other strategically important countries.</p> <p>If the second half of 2018 provided isolated evidence that global growth had peaked, the data since the turn of the year has been unambiguous: all of the world\u2019s major economies look weaker than they did 12 months ago. Britain grew by just 0.2% in the final three months of 2018, as did the eurozone. And Italy is suffering its fifth recession in two decades.</p> <p>Spending by American consumers in December was weak, but perhaps of more significance was the sharp pull-back in manufacturing in January, which fits with a picture of declining factory output elsewhere. In the winter of 2008, crashing industrial production and a contraction in trade flows were signs of the depth of the global slump. Ominously, both are again weak.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2019-02-23T13:19:16/embed.html\" data-alt=\"growth forecasts\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2019-02-23T13:19:16/embed.html\">growth forecasts</a> </figure>  <p>For countries heavily dependent on exports as a source of growth \u2013 China, Germany, Japan and South Korea \u2013 falling demand for their goods is bad news.</p> <p>Globalisation has increased the tendency of one economy to be synchronised with all the others: there was a generalised upswing in the 1990s when China was a destination for western foreign investment, a growing market for exporters of commodities and industrial machinery, and the source of cheap goods that kept inflation and interest rates low.</p> <p>But the flipside of this model is that everybody suffers together when times are tough. While spectacular by western standards, China\u2019s growth of 6.6% in 2018 was the slowest since 1990, and weakness intensified as the year wore on.</p> <p>China has been a key export market for Germany, which has only barely escaped falling into a technical recession \u2013 defined as two successive quarters of negative growth. The latest snapshot of manufacturing in Japan pointed to a contraction in factory output.</p> <p>Announcing the International Monetary Fund\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/21/imf-brexit-trump-trade-war-china-world-economic-outlook\" title=\"\">latest forecasts</a> for the world economy in Davos last month, the fund\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, said that while a recession was \u201cnot around the corner\u201d, the risks of a sharper decline in activity had increased. Policymakers should make greater efforts, Lagarde added, to prepare for a slowdown.</p> <h2>2. What steps are being taken?</h2> <p>In December, the US central bank raised interest rates, possibly for the last time this decade.

      "bodyText": "Central banks are getting twitchy. On average, recessions have come along once a decade since the mid-1970s and the nadir of the last downturn occurred almost a decade ago. The Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman has predicted that there will be a recession in America by the time Donald Trump comes up for re-election at the end of next year. The darkening outlook for global growth is putting pressure on the US president to resolve his trade dispute with China. When the White House announced its first tranche of protectionist measures almost a year ago, hopes were high that the world economy had at last shrugged off the long hangover from the financial crisis and deep slump of 2008-09. In the months before Trump went toe-to-toe with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, it was expanding strongly and the International Monetary Fund was talking about a synchronised upturn. A year later \u2013 and with the 1 March deadline for a fresh round of US tariffs fast approaching \u2013 the mood has changed. All of which raises three big questions: 1. What is happening to the global economy? Official statistics in the US have been delayed as a result of the federal government shutdown, but when the figures for growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 are finally released this week, they are expected to show that the world\u2019s biggest economy has joined in a slowdown that is affecting Europe, China and a slew of other strategically important countries. If the second half of 2018 provided isolated evidence that global growth had peaked, the data since the turn of the year has been unambiguous: all of the world\u2019s major economies look weaker than they did 12 months ago. Britain grew by just 0.2% in the final three months of 2018, as did the eurozone. And Italy is suffering its fifth recession in two decades. Spending by American consumers in December was weak, but perhaps of more significance was the sharp pull-back in manufacturing in January, which fits with a picture of declining factory output elsewhere. In the winter of 2008, crashing industrial production and a contraction in trade flows were signs of the depth of the global slump. Ominously, both are again weak. For countries heavily dependent on exports as a source of growth \u2013 China, Germany, Japan and South Korea \u2013 falling demand for their goods is bad news. Globalisation has increased the tendency of one economy to be synchronised with all the others: there was a generalised upswing in the 1990s when China was a destination for western foreign investment, a growing market for exporters of commodities and industrial machinery, and the source of cheap goods that kept inflation and interest rates low. But the flipside of this model is that everybody suffers together when times are tough. While spectacular by western standards, China\u2019s growth of 6.6% in 2018 was the slowest since 1990, and weakness intensified as the year wore on. China has been a key export market for Germany, which has only barely escaped falling into a technical recession \u2013 defined as two successive quarters of negative growth. The latest snapshot of manufacturing in Japan pointed to a contraction in factory output. Announcing the International Monetary Fund\u2019s latest forecasts for the world economy in Davos last month, the fund\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, said that while a recession was \u201cnot around the corner\u201d, the risks of a sharper decline in activity had increased. Policymakers should make greater efforts, Lagarde added, to prepare for a slowdown. 2. What steps are being taken? In December, the US central bank raised interest rates, possibly for the last time this decade. Considered by many economists to be a huge mistake, the increase, to between 2.25% and 2.5%, was an act of pride, coming as it did after a series of tweets from Trump urging the Federal Reserve to pause. Trump\u2019s tweets were deemed to be the work of a bully, and in its determination to defend its independence the Fed ignored the fact that, on this issue, the president might have had a point. When its policymakers met again in January, there was an almost complete U-turn. No longer would the Fed be making three quarter-point rate rises this year. It would also do more to keep intact the stimulus programme it adopted in the wake of the banking crash \u2013 a process known as quantitative easing (QE), which the Fed has reduced from $4.5tn to $4tn over the past couple of years. \u201cThey will have a permanently gigantic balance sheet,\u201d said Ward McCarthy, chief US financial economist at investment bank Jefferies. \u201cThey always said it would be larger than pre-crisis, but earlier commentary suggested it would be significantly smaller.\u201d Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank (ECB), is staring at the same data as the Fed. His message to the world has been: as someone who was less bullish in the good times, I have less reason to be panicked today. At his January press conference, he said the ECB was not yet ready to reverse its policy, set out in December, of stabilising its stimulus package. He said its stock of loans would stay at \u20ac2.6tn. Yes, he was gloomier about prospects for the eurozone economy, but no, he wasn\u2019t ready to change course yet. In Rome, the coalition government comprising the far-right League and radical M5S wanted him to loosen the purse strings and keep pumping out cheap money, while the German government wanted the ECB to follow the Fed\u2019s previous policy. Draghi looked calm taking the middle road. In Tokyo, the Bank of Japan has remained immune to all talk of normalising monetary policy, 10 years after the banking crash. It has continued to expand its lending and in the past week hinted that it might even accelerate the policy to prevent Japan falling into recession. China, meanwhile, has taken a series of steps to boost spending and lending in an effort to counter the forces bringing about a dramatic slowing of consumer spending and business investment. Pantheon Macroeconomics\u2019 chief Asia economist, Freya Beamish, and senior Asia economist Miguel Chanco said last week that the People\u2019s Bank of China had surreptitiously cut interest rates by using complex financial instruments. \u201cWe think the [central] bank would like to make the effective rate cut overt. Trade talks, for now, are making that difficult,\u201d they said. 3. What if these measures are not enough? Central banks and finance ministries had better hope that the action taken so far will be enough to avert a recession because they will soon run out of conventional policy options. In 2008-09, the response to the financial crisis was fivefold: the central banks cut interest rates aggressively; they pumped cheap money into their economies through QE; finance ministries bailed out the banks with taxpayers\u2019 money; governments ran bigger budget deficits as a way of boosting growth; and international cooperation kept trade flowing. But today interest rates are still either zero or just about zero in most of the developed world; QE has been subject to the law of diminishing returns and has proved politically controversial; the public appetite for another round of bank bailouts is nonexistent; government debt levels are much higher than they were a decade ago; and economic nationalism is on the rise. Krugman said in a Bloomberg interview: \u201cWe\u2019re clearly in worse shape. We came into the last crisis with interest rates well above zero, we came into the last crisis with debt substantially lower than it is now \u2026 and we came into the last crisis with substantially better leadership \u2026 Our current treasury secretary [Steven Mnuchin] is no Hank Paulson. \u201cI think we\u2019re in much worse shape. We probably don\u2019t have a crisis of that magnitude about to hit us \u2013 God help us if we do \u2013 but we\u2019re in much worse shape to deal with whatever shocks come along than we were 10 years ago.\u201d Central banks and finance ministries would have some options in the event of another severe downturn. Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser at Capital Economics, says rates could be cut to below zero, QE could be expanded and governments could run even bigger deficits than they currently have. Serious consideration could also be given to the use of \u201chelicopter money\u201d \u2013 tax cuts and public spending that are paid for by a permanent increase in the money supply by central banks, almost as though the government were dropping money from the sky for citizens to spend. But Redwood adds a cautionary note. \u201cPolicymakers are not powerless in the face of the next downturn. Indeed, we expect their tools to prove adequate to cope with a relatively modest slowdown. However, if there was a more severe downturn, we think that policymakers would be reluctant to undertake the more radical steps that would be required \u2013 with a weak policy response raising the risk of a prolonged slump.\u201d",

I did not miss the office stuff, the swotting up and sometimes scary interviewing, but missed the writing. We were living in a small flat that summer because building work was going on at home. The idea came to me one Saturday afternoon, and I couldn\u2019t argue with it. The following Monday I started writing. I found the slow reveal of Frances\u2019s character attractive. You have huge descriptive flair yet, intriguingly, you never describe Frances\u2019s appearance. Will Joanne Froggatt need to de-prettify herself for the role (as she did as Anna Bates in Downton Abbey)? I hate being told what characters look like. Joanne might have to make a transition because Frances\u2019s appearance improves\u2026 Frances is a good listener \u2013 are you? Not as good as I should be. But as I\u2019ve lost my sight I\u2019ve become less beady. Something awful happened to me, but everyone has their shit to deal with\u2026 As you get older, you realise that. \u2022 Alys, Always is at the Bridge theatre, London, until 30 March",

But it cannot be relied on any more, says Yoav Barkay-Arbel, an engineer for Mekorot, the national water company. Standing at the Eshkol water pumping station on the peak of a hill, Barkay-Arbel looks across a series of reservoirs and intricate piping systems. Zionists in the early 1920s had intended to use the lake in the green, lush north to supply water to the arid south and \u201cmake the desert bloom\u201d.

However, the Eshkol station was never meant to move water east instead of west. Open canals, built by engineers in the 1950s at a slight angle to improve water flow, still cut through the land. But they are at the wrong angle, and so a new pipe is being constructed along their side. \u201cThey never thought they would have to fill the lake with artificial water,\u201d says Barkay-Arbel. \u201cThat is crazy. You cannot count on nature.\u201d Nevertheless, the current plan is to be moving water in the next couple of years.</p> <p>Saving the Sea of Galilee could, in turn, save the river Jordan, says Bromberg. He has campaigned to reopen the dam that blocks the lake from flowing into the Jordan. Without it, the river\u2019s fragile ecosystem will deteriorate drastically and it could turn into a dry river bed. Five years ago, Israel agreed to release 9m cubic metres from the Sea of Galilee, a tiny amount of water, the first time its waters had run uninterrupted into the river since the 1960s. But hundreds of cubic metres will be needed to fully rehabilitate the river.</p> <p>The source of the river is now a small creek, with two pipes each less than half a metre wide that pump out water. A third pipe releases yellowish liquid. This is treated sewage \u2013 not ideal, Bromberg says, but better than nothing.</p> <p>As long as the Sea of Galilee is under threat, the river Jordan will be too. And their eventual deaths could have explosive ramifications as water in this region has been a key source of conflict. The river Jordan is shared by Israel, the occupied Palestinian territories, Jordan and Syria, all of which use its depleting reserves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cce8c389a6b8021d729ac8992c78e273f4079d32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cce8c389a6b8021d729ac8992c78e273f4079d32/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Island on lake\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Islands have become exposed as water levels fall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIsrael takes half, Syria and Jordan take the other half,\u201d says Bromberg. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a war zone, they take everything \u2026 The mindset of conflict leads to the complete demise of the river Jordan.\u201d</p> <p>In 2000, Syria\u2019s then president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/jun/15/guardianweekly.guardianweekly1\" title=\"\">Hafez al-Assad,</a> father of the current president, Bashar, turned down a deal to end three decades of on-off war on the basis that Israel refused to give him back access to the north-eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee.

      "body": "<p>An Italian particle physicist, Fabiola Gianotti, 58, has been the director general of Cern since January 2016. Previously she led a collaboration of around 3,000 physicists from 38 countries which co-discovered the Higgs boson in 2012. Last month Cern published plans for a \u20ac20bn successor to the Large Hadron Collider.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s up with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)? </strong><br>The LHC is in shutdown because we are going to upgrade the accelerator complex. We\u2019ll upgrade the injectors and the experiments and resume taking data in 2021 with higher intensity beams. We\u2019ll run for three more years and then shut down again until 2026 to upgrade the LHC for the high-luminosity phase. Higher luminosity means more collisions. We can study fundamental particles in much more detail. We\u2019ll be producing about 15m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/higgs-boson\" title=\"\">Higgs bosons</a> per year.</p> <p><strong>When the LHC switched on, physicists talked of finding the Higgs boson, dark matter and even extra dimensions. Are you disappointed not to have found more than the Higgs?</strong><br>Yes and no. Yes, because discovering new particles is fantastic. It\u2019s very glamorous and fascinating and it means we have found new physics. No, in the sense that we know the open questions are difficult. It\u2019s not obvious that we\u2019ll find the answers with one collider. Research requires a lot of patience. And physics is not just about discoveries. The discoveries are the most glamorous part of it, but extremely precise measurements of known phenomena, ruling out scenarios for physics beyond the <a href=\"https://home.cern/science/physics/standard-model\" title=\"\">Standard Model</a>, or a given theory, are important too. The discoveries make the front pages of the newspapers while precise measurements of a known particle don\u2019t, but scientifically they are just as important.</p> <p><strong>A theory called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/dec/09/supersymmetry-particle-physics-cern-forshaw\" title=\"\">supersymmetry</a> predicts the existence of partners for the particles we know already. It would explain why the Higgs is light, and perhaps even tell us what makes up dark matter. The LHC has found no sign of it. Is supersymmetry dead?</strong><br>I don\u2019t know. Maybe supersymmetry exists but we haven\u2019t seen it because we don\u2019t have enough data, or it\u2019s at an energy the LHC cannot reach, or at an energy no collider on Earth will ever reach. Or it\u2019s the wrong theory. I can\u2019t tell you. But, for me, it is important not to run behind a particular theory. We don\u2019t know what answer nature has for the open questions. We don\u2019t know if supersymmetry is the answer to the dark matter question or if it\u2019s something else. If the answer is supersymmetry, then supersymmetric particles will show up either in the LHC, or in the next machine, or in some other way.</p> <p><strong>You led the </strong><strong>collaboration</strong><strong> that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jul/04/higgs-boson-cern-scientists-discover\" title=\"\">announced the discovery of the Higgs boson</a> on 4</strong><strong> July 2012. What was that like?</strong><br>It was the most exciting time of my scientific life. There is nothing more rewarding for a research physicist than to discover a new particle. And it\u2019s a very special one. The Higgs boson was the missing component of the Standard Model. But getting to the discovery was a really a long path. It required the effort of thousands of physicists and engineers to conceive and then build the LHC and detectors, which are marvels of technology. When we realised what technologies we needed, it really looked like mission impossible. But in the end, we managed to build a fantastic machine with fantastic experiments. The performance is beyond our most optimistic expectations. It has been hard work, it has been teamwork and it was a fantastic discovery. All these elements together made it special for me.</p> <p><strong>It must have been an extremely intense time</strong><strong>.</strong><br>In the month leading up to the discovery we were working nights and days. The buildings at Cern where [we were working] were fully populated at night with people having pizzas at 3am. We had to go through thousands of checks, cross-checks and verifications. It was a very good lesson for the young people on how you get there, how much effort is behind it, how careful, how serious and how rigorous you have to be before you go public with a discovery.</p> <p><strong>Last year, Cern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/01/physics-was-built-by-men-cern-scientist-alessandro-strumia-remark-sparks-fury\" title=\"\">suspended an Italian physicist, Alessandro Strumia</a> of Pisa University, for comments he made at a workshop on gender and high-energy physics. He claimed that men, not women, are discriminated against and that he was passed over for a job that a woman in the audience got, despite him having more citations. </strong><br>He was suspended from Cern not for his ideas, because there is freedom of expression at Cern, but for publicly attacking colleagues in the audience. You don\u2019t use a seminar, where you are invited to talk and to express your ideas, in front of an audience of young people, to launch personal attacks on your colleagues. This is a violation of our code of conduct that, as a first principle, is based on respect.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The fact that 95%\u00a0of the universe is dark, unknown to\u00a0us, is a major embarrassment for\u00a0scientists</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Have you faced discrimination in your career?</strong><br>I never felt discriminated against, but some of my female colleagues were not so lucky. I don\u2019t think I had to go through more difficult choices, more difficult steps, in my career because I am a woman. At least, I didn\u2019t realise it if I did. I felt I had the same opportunities as my male colleagues. But again, I know female colleagues and friends who were not so lucky and did not have the same opportunities as men. There is still a lot to be done. We have to do a lot not only for gender diversity, but for diversity in general. Diversity is an asset of humanity, it\u2019s our richness, and we have to use it in the best possible way.</p> <p><strong>Last summer, your name came up as one of five women in the running to be Italy\u2019s transitional prime minister. Are you tempted to go into politics? </strong><br>No. I can tell you that the newspaper headlines came as a surprise to me. I was not contacted about it. I am a scientist, I like doing physics. What I like about my job as director general, and it\u2019s a fantastic job, is that I still have time to do scientific work. I cannot run an analysis or develop a detector prototype as I used to, but I can contribute to strategic planning, follow Cern\u2019s projects, and participate in technical and scientific discussions.</p> <p><strong>Last month Cern </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/15/cern-draws-up-plans-for-collider-four-times-the-size-of-large-hadron\" title=\"\">published designs for a \u20ac20bn</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/15/cern-draws-up-plans-for-collider-four-times-the-size-of-large-hadron\" title=\"\"> Future Circular Collider</a></strong><strong> that would be four times the size of the LHC. How do you justify such a machine?</strong><br>The Future Circular Collider is not an approved project. Every six to seven years, European particle physicists get together to develop a roadmap for the future of the discipline. This time, there are two projects on the table for a post-LHC. The Compact Linear Collider, or Clic, is a 50km-long electron-positron collider that would start at 380GeV [giga electron volts] and ultimately reach 5TeV [tera electron volts]. The Future Circular Collider will be a ring of about 100km: it can provide electron-positron, proton-proton and ion collisions. Both will be discussed by the physicists. These are not projects that are built and operated in a couple of years. They are expensive, but the cost is spread over decades as it was with the LHC.</p> <p><strong>But what are they for?</strong><br>It\u2019s important to underline that we need to make progress in our understanding of fundamental physics. The fact that 95% of the universe is dark, is unknown to us, is a major embarrassment for scientists today. But it\u2019s also very exciting: it means there are many, many new things to discover. Dark matter is a question mark. Nobody knows if it is very light or very heavy and there is no unique instrument to find it. Nobody knows if it will be found by cosmic surveys, or underground detectors looking for dark matter particles from the intergalactic halo, or colliders. We have to attack the problem from different sides. It is very important to develop the technology to reach the highest possible energy and build a financially feasible machine.</p> <p>We should not underestimate that fundamental physics, not only in our field, is so ambitious in its goals that it is a driver of innovation. It requires development, construction and operation of instruments that require cutting-edge technologies, which benefit everybody. Not to mention the impact of educating and training thousands of scientists, most of whom go into society in other walks of life.</p> <p><strong>With so much of the universe unknown to us, is there still a place for God? </strong><br>Science and religion are two separate endeavours. I\u2019m an experimental physicist. My approach is based on what I see and what I measure.</p> <p><strong>Other countries want to build huge colliders. Why is it important for Cern to have another machine after the LHC?</strong><br>A post-LHC will be a very important tool. It has a strong scientific motivation and will present extremely demanding and difficult challenges in terms of technology. That it\u2019s a scientifically and technologically valuable project is demonstrated by the fact that other countries, other regions in the world, are discussing similar colliders. Japan is discussing the possibility of building a linear collider. China is considering a 100km circular collider. This really speaks to the importance of the project. With Cern, Europe has regained leadership in fundamental physics at the energy frontier and also in the advanced technologies that are needed to do these experiments. For me, it would be a real pity if that leadership were to go elsewhere in the world.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Protesters gathered at the BBC\u2019s Salford headquarters for a demonstration organised by Tommy Robinson during which his film Panodrama was shown on a big screen next to the broadcaster\u2019s HQ. The former leader of the English Defence League, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was protesting against BBC Panorama\u2019s investigations into him. Stand Up To Racism and Unite Against Fascism organised a counter-protest nearby on Saturday afternoon. There were speakers from Momentum, and anti-fascists held placards with slogans including \u201cstop the fascist Tommy Robinson\u201d. \u201cPeople of various backgrounds, age, gender and race assembled to share a message of hope, unity and community,\u201d said Navendu Mishra, a Labour and Unite activist. \u201cWe will not allow anyone to divide us, as our nation faces new challenges globally and at home.\u201d A number of police officers and vehicles were in the area and temporary metal barriers had been placed around the BBC buildings. Greater Manchester police said there had been no arrests, and that around 4,000 people had attended the demonstration. Anti-fascist organisers said around 800 people were at their counter-protest. Michael Bradley from National Stand Up To Racism said: \u201cRobinson and his [supporters] are trying to build off the backs of the growth of the far right in the US, Brazil and across Europe, but a united anti-racist and anti-fascist movement can stop them.\u201d Members of the crowd sang \u201coh Tommy, Tommy\u201d as Robinson arrived on stage and attacked the media. He went on to claim that \u201cevidence of a corrupt media is that not one single journalist in Britain has reported on Panodrama\u201d. The Ukip leader, Gerard Batten, was one of several that spoke before Robinson aired his film. \u201cHe speaks up for things that are right, he tells the truth and he can mobilise lots of people like you, and that\u2019s what they fear,\u201d he told demonstrators. In a statement, the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said they \u201croundly condemn Tommy Robinson \u2026 and his fellow, far-right thugs who intend to intimidate staff at the corporation, particularly those working on Panorama\u201d. \u201cBBC staff should be free to do their jobs without these threats,\u201d the NUJ spokesperson said. \u201cIntimidation, threats and violence carried out by far-right protesters systematically targeting the media, especially photojournalists, are becoming more frequent and we will always call out this behaviour and report criminal activity to the police.\u201d The BBC confirmed that Panorama is investigating Robinson and rejected the idea that their journalism was faked or biased. \u201cAny programme we broadcast will adhere to the BBC\u2019s strict editorial guidelines,\u201d a spokesman said.",

      "bodyText": "It is included in the formal contract of every writer here that they must watch Fleabag and discuss how much they love both it and Phoebe Waller-Bridge on a regular basis, otherwise we are denied our annual bonus of discount Birkenstocks. Happily, Fleabag is returning for a second season on 4 March, which at least gives us something to go on. The comedy wrapped its story up so neatly in its first season, back in 2016, that some trepidation about its return is only natural. However, the new series trailer, released last week, suggests that such feelings may be misguided: there is lusting after a priest; eye-wateringly candid counselling; and the promise of a hot misogynist. Fleabag is back, baby! This time, though, it will air on BBC One, rather than online-only on BBC Three as it did in its initial incarnation, and it will be shown in weekly instalments. Actually, it was released weekly in 2016, too, but these days it feels almost quaint to make people wait seven days to see what\u2019s going to happen next. Killing Eve, which similarly harnessed Waller-Bridge\u2019s brilliance as writer and showrunner, was on television on Saturdays, but was also left online in one big juicy boxset on which one could gorge oneself instantly, should the appetite demand it. It is becoming more and more common for shows to be released all at once. Pure, Channel 4\u2019s very good comedy drama, is still on, but I finished it in a week, because all six episodes were put online on the day it debuted. The series is not dissimilar to Fleabag, at least tonally, and its episodes are short, which made it a manageable binge. But once I had finished, I started to feel a slight sense that I had overdone it, that perhaps it would have revealed its charms more plainly had it been meted out by the week. Besides, I was sad that it was over so quickly. I see it in the television listings now and think, wistfully, about what could have been. There is so much good television that it is simply impossible to get through even a snippet of it, which means that delayed gratification is starting to become more and more appealing. The frenzy over Bodyguard last summer, in which we all \u2013 horror of horrors \u2013 seemed to watch the same programme on the same screen at the same time, so that we could talk about it together, showed that a reprieve from the \u201cjust-one-more\u201d pressure of boxsets is certainly welcome, and perhaps overdue. Much like the second season of Fleabag. Nintendo boss is not the villain As winter comes to an end and spring pokes its sunny head above the clouds, and green shoots begin to appear once again, and life seems just that little bit less grey, along comes a news story that distracts from all the chaos with simple, flippant and silly joy. Nintendo has announced that the successor to its outgoing US president and chief operating officer, Reggie Fils-Aime, will be its senior vice-president of sales and marketing, Doug Bowser. \u201cAnd I ask you, with a name like Bowser, who better to hold the keys to the Nintendo castle?\u201d said Fils-Aime, in a farewell message to fans. \u201cLiterally anyone not named after one of Nintendo\u2019s most famous baddies!\u201d replied the collective voice of the internet, which was then drowned out by the collective voice of headline writers everywhere, who had a ball with \u201cBowser takes over\u201d. This all happened once before, when Bowser \u2013 the man Bowser, not the spiky-shelled villain Bowser \u2013 arrived as VP of sales in 2015. He thanked fans by posing for a picture in front of stuffed Nintendo toys, including Mario and Luigi, who had been slyly tied up in the background. Nominative determinism is rarely as fun as this. Raise a glass to the battling pub landlady Reading the words \u201cproperty developers\u201d in a news story has a similar effect on me as seeing the name of a long-forgotten celebrity you once loved: you steel yourself, take a deep breath and think, what have they done now? Whether it\u2019s turfing out social housing tenants or segregating affordable housing residents, developers have been a ghoulish spectre in modern cities, driving up rent and property prices even while poverty and homelessness spread on their own doorstep. One of the many gruesome effects of gentrification is that it often suffocates what attracted people to an area in the first place.

His career in Hollywood was so long, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/03/stanley-donan-singin-in-the-rain\">he told Vanity Fair in 2013</a>, \u201csound was still a fairly new thing when I came into movies.

Introducing it, the director Martin Scorsese, then himself unrecognised by the Academy, said: \u201cOnce upon a time, a lonely boy in South Carolina was sparked by the wonder of movies, captivated by everything from cowboys to comedians to movie monsters. And then he saw his first musical, Flying Down to Rio.\u201d</p> <p>In his Vanity Fair interview in 2013, Donen said: \u201cI saw Fred Astaire in Flying Down to Rio when I was nine years old, and it changed my life. It just seemed wonderful, and my life wasn\u2019t wonderful. The joy of dancing to music! And Fred was so amazing, and Ginger [Rogers] \u2013 Oh, God! Ginger!\u201d</p> <p>Donen danced on Broadway, where he met Kelly, with whom he worked as a choreographer in Hollywood. They worked closely together but ultimately the partnership was not a smooth one, as Donen <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/08/movies/the-man-who-helped-kelly-put-his-best-foot-forward.html\">told the New York Times in 1996</a>.</p> <p>\u201cGene, as a performer, was among the wonders of the 20th century,\u201d he said. \u201cHis agility and his talents at being what he would call a song and dance man were very winning.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I didn\u2019t like \u2026 was his manner offscreen. He could be difficult with me and everyone else. It was always a complicated collaboration, partly because when we began he was a star and I was in the chorus. Then we became co-choreographers.

      "bodyText": "Stanley Donen, director of Singin\u2019 in the Rain and other classics of the golden age of Hollywood, has died. He was 94. Singin\u2019 in the Rain, from 1952, starred Donen\u2019s co-director Gene Kelly and became a mainstay of popular culture. Donen was also a dancer and choreographer. Among other films he directed were the musicals On the Town (his first film, from 1949 and starring Kelly, his co-director, and Frank Sinatra), Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954) and Funny Face (1957), starring Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn. He made four films with Cary Grant: Kiss Them For Me (1957), Indiscreet (1958), The Grass is Greener (1960) and Charade, also starring Hepburn (1963). His last theatrically released film was the Michael Caine sex comedy Blame It on Rio, which flopped in 1984. Among tributes, the director Guillermo del Toro saluted \u201ca brilliant storyteller\u201d who he said was \u201celegant, exuberant, a master of color and [a] top crane choreographer\u201d and added: \u201cHe had so much style and so much joy in him \u2026 We are indebted to him for as long as there is cinema.\u201d In a statement, Steven Spielberg said Donen \u201cwas a friend and an early mentor\u201d who \u201cmade his most compelling movies in multiple genres\u201d. \u201cCharade, Bedazzled and Two For the Road were my favorites,\u201d Spielberg said. \u201cWhen visiting New York I will miss not bumping into him on his daily walks and hear him talking about life and film, which for Stanley were inseparable.\u201d Donen was born in Columbia, South Carolina, on 13 April 1924. His career in Hollywood was so long, he told Vanity Fair in 2013, \u201csound was still a fairly new thing when I came into movies. And the reason musicals happened is because of sound. They could put music in the picture! That\u2019s how it all began.\u201d In a tweet on Saturday which said one of Donen\u2019s sons had confirmed his father\u2019s death, the Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips said the director was \u201ca huge, often neglected talent\u201d. Donen was never nominated for an Oscar but at the 1997 ceremony he was given an honorary award. Introducing it, the director Martin Scorsese, then himself unrecognised by the Academy, said: \u201cOnce upon a time, a lonely boy in South Carolina was sparked by the wonder of movies, captivated by everything from cowboys to comedians to movie monsters. And then he saw his first musical, Flying Down to Rio.\u201d In his Vanity Fair interview in 2013, Donen said: \u201cI saw Fred Astaire in Flying Down to Rio when I was nine years old, and it changed my life. It just seemed wonderful, and my life wasn\u2019t wonderful. The joy of dancing to music! And Fred was so amazing, and Ginger [Rogers] \u2013 Oh, God! Ginger!\u201d Donen danced on Broadway, where he met Kelly, with whom he worked as a choreographer in Hollywood. They worked closely together but ultimately the partnership was not a smooth one, as Donen told the New York Times in 1996. \u201cGene, as a performer, was among the wonders of the 20th century,\u201d he said. \u201cHis agility and his talents at being what he would call a song and dance man were very winning. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t like \u2026 was his manner offscreen. He could be difficult with me and everyone else. It was always a complicated collaboration, partly because when we began he was a star and I was in the chorus. Then we became co-choreographers. It wasn\u2019t always the happiest thing.\u201d After Donen\u2019s first marriage ended in divorce, Kelly married his ex-wife, Jeanne Coyne. Accepting his Oscar from Scorsese, Donen focused on sunnier themes. \u201cTonight,\u201d he said, \u201cwords seem inadequate. In musicals, that\u2019s when we do a song.\u201d To the delight of the audience, he then sang and danced Cheek to Cheek, from the 1935 Astaire-Rogers classic Top Hat, with his statuette. The secret of directing success, he confided, was to get the best writers, songwriters and actors and then, \u201cwhen filming starts, you stay the hell out of the way. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to show up, otherwise you can\u2019t take the credit and get one of these fellas.\u201d Donen was married five times and had a famous affair with Elizabeth Taylor. In later years he was \u201chappily unmarried\u201d to the comedian, actor and director Elaine May, with whom he collaborated on theatrical projects. In 2014, the Nickelodeon Theatre in Columbia staged a season of Donen\u2019s films, entitled A Lotta Talent and a Little Luck. The organiser said: \u201cThough so many people love his work, too few people know who he is, much less that he\u2019s a native.\u201d Despite this, among film cognoscenti his place is secure. The British critic David Thomson, author of the New Biographical Dictionary of Film, called him \u201ca central figure in the story of the MGM musical\u201d.

We\u2019re asking more questions of the opposition. The number of times we put their back four under pressure! They\u2019re a top side, we\u2019re not making any bold claims. But the best thing of all was our calmness when it went 1-1. The first goal, if it\u2019s a corner or not, is a tough one to call, a ricochet. My gripe about theirs is, not only does it go out this side of the halfway line, it then gets thrown in eight yards the other side, and also the fourth official grabbed the ball and gave it back to them, so he plays it quickly. And that leads to a goal. That\u2019s the gripe. That\u2019s really frustrating. A massive moment, and that went against us. Other than that, I though the officials had a good game.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c715f37e4b0cc09362e1ff5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-23T14:59:09.887Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A contrite Pochettinho in the press conference:</strong> \u201cYou know how important the game was.

It is not normally how I behave. It is difficult for us to be a contender now. There are a lot of games to play but in my mind we needed the three points to put pressure on. We cannot blame anyone other than ourselves, because we were unable to win. Everyone on the touchline complained, they complained, we complained, we try to back our players.

Many pints of steam are pouring out of his lugs! I wish I could read lips. Dean said \u201cgo away\u201d quite a lot, that I do know. Chances are we haven\u2019t heard the last of this.

Enjoy! </p> <p>\u201cThere were some cracking matches between these two teams in the late 50s and early 60s, many of which I was lucky enough to see. The Clarets were desperately unlucky in the 61-62 season. I saw just about every home game they played (I was 12) and they were just irresistible for the first half of the season, wonderful football from probably their greatest-ever side. </p> <p>\u201cBut there were a lot of cancellations because of a particularly hard winter and, along with their FA Cup run (several replays), the fixtures and injuries piled up and up. With the small squads of those days, they were gradually worn down and couldn\u2019t seem to do anything else but draw. Even then they could have got back against Spurs in the FA Cup final but for a very debatable penalty late on.</p> <p>\u201cThe next season for the third round of the Cup they were drawn away at Spurs. They won 3-0. But the match I remember best at Turf Moor - apart from my first in April \u201961 which was their win 4-2 against Spurs after being 2-0 down at half time, a score that even the official Spurs history says was \u2018very much against the run of play\u2019 - was in April 1964.

What happened in the early stages of the season has been parked, and there\u2019s a freshness and a clarity in the group going into the second half of the season.\u201d<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c7137fde4b0cc09362e1e67\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-23T12:14:07.411Z\">12.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It\u2019s a lovely day in Lancashire. </strong>Yellow beams streaming into Turf Moor and all across this famous old mill town.

It\u2019s a tough assignment for the title hopefuls, but they\u2019ll take succour from the fact they\u2019ve won on their last two visits to Turf Moor. This is poised deliciously.

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s your lot. Paul Wilson was our man at Turf Moor. Here\u2019s his take. Thanks for reading! And we haven\u2019t forgotten about Sean Dyche! \u201cThe relentless nature, the will and determination, has come back to us. We\u2019re asking more questions of the opposition. The number of times we put their back four under pressure! They\u2019re a top side, we\u2019re not making any bold claims. But the best thing of all was our calmness when it went 1-1. The first goal, if it\u2019s a corner or not, is a tough one to call, a ricochet. My gripe about theirs is, not only does it go out this side of the halfway line, it then gets thrown in eight yards the other side, and also the fourth official grabbed the ball and gave it back to them, so he plays it quickly. And that leads to a goal. That\u2019s the gripe. That\u2019s really frustrating. A massive moment, and that went against us. Other than that, I though the officials had a good game.\u201d A contrite Pochettinho in the press conference: \u201cYou know how important the game was. Of course when you feel so disappointed and upset you make mistakes ... I made a mistake and needed to go to the dressing room and get some water and relax ... what happened happened.\u201d Mauricio Pochettino, calm and frank, gives his verdict. \u201cWhat happened on the pitch happened. We made a few mistakes. Burnley fight a lot and we don\u2019t deserve the defeat, but that is football. It was an important game, we needed the three points to fight for the Premier League. It is not normally how I behave. It is difficult for us to be a contender now. There are a lot of games to play but in my mind we needed the three points to put pressure on. We cannot blame anyone other than ourselves, because we were unable to win. Everyone on the touchline complained, they complained, we complained, we try to back our players. We need to improve for the next time. I am going to accept everything from the FA, but I hope nothing will go further.\u201d But here\u2019s something worth pointing out: Spurs didn\u2019t fold this afternoon, they were just beaten by a fine side at the top of their game. Burnley were very determined, very tough ... and very, very good. They played an excellent match, and look a proper side again, after a rocky start to the campaign. Their goalscoring heroes Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood - both relentless - are interviewed by Sky, and they\u2019re extremely pleased with a precious three points. Barnes admits to targeting Foyth \u201ca little bit\u201d, while Wood report that confidence at Turf Moor is high at the moment. \u201cWe have to make it difficult for these big teams,\u201d says Barnes, \u201cand we did that. We\u2019ve shown how good we are.\u201d By all accounts, the row between Pochettino and Dean spilled down the tunnel. Shades of the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 2016! Something may or may not have been said after Pochettino complained to Dean at the final whistle, hence his willingness to return and engage in further debate. A repeated enquiry of \u201cwhat did you say?\u201d answered every time by \u201cgo away\u201d. No doubt we\u2019ll hear more of this, grapple fans. No doubt at all! Mauricio Pochettino loses his rag completely! He gets right up in Mike Dean\u2019s grille, demanding explanation for something or other. The corner that led to the opening goal? If it\u2019s just that, this reaction is well out of proportion, given Spurs got the benefit of a generous decision for their equaliser, too. So it\u2019ll be interesting to hear what that was all about. Pochettino came back for seconds, too, invading the referee\u2019s personal space in the chest-out, no-nonsense style. Many pints of steam are pouring out of his lugs! I wish I could read lips. Dean said \u201cgo away\u201d quite a lot, that I do know. Chances are we haven\u2019t heard the last of this. A magnificent pantomime rumble, highly entertaining, although depending on your stance on these things, the usual think-of-the-children caveat applies. Burnley claim three precious points! They were marvellous today, and surely won\u2019t be going down. Tottenham\u2019s title bid meanwhile takes a serious hit. 90 min +3: It really hasn\u2019t been Tottenham\u2019s day. A cross from the left. Lamela rises, six yards out. He surely has to score and salvage a point for the title hopefuls. But he sends a lame header straight at Heaton. 90 min +2: Wood takes the ball to the corner flag on the left. Tick, tock. By the dugouts, Pochettinho crosses his arms tightly and tucks his hands into his armpits. More frustration. 90 min: Kane crosses from the left. It\u2019s half cleared and drops to Eriksen, who sends a tame shot over the crossbar. There will be four added minutes. 89 min: Now the hosts win a corner. Steam pours from Sissoko\u2019s ears as he tussles with Brady, who is just pushing his buttons because he can. All the while, time continues to run out for Tottenham. 88 min: Brady wins a throw out on the left, deep in Spurs territory. Before it can be taken, Lucas Moura comes on for Son, who has been uncharacteristically quiet today. Burnley then take the throw, and hold the ball up in the corner awhile, before winning another. Rinse and repeat. Spurs are getting visibly frustrated. 86 min: Llorente commits a common-or-garden foul on the edge of the Burnley box. free kick. Lamela doesn\u2019t agree with the decision, and engages the referee in vigorous philosophical debate. He goes in the book. 85 min: Unless Spurs can magic up a dramatic turnaround, they\u2019ll be five points behind leaders Manchester City and second-placed Liverpool, the latter still with tomorrow\u2019s match at Manchester United in hand. This explains why Pochettino is slumped back in his seat, with a face on. He\u2019s fuming. Brady overcooks a cross from the left. Goal kick. But then Aurier faffs about while dribbling upfield, allowing Gudmundsson to drive into the box from the left. He shoots ... he scuffs ... but the ball dribbles diagonally towards Barnes, at the far post. He\u2019s six yards out, and can\u2019t miss! 82 min: A free kick for Burnley out on the right, Gudmundsson purchasing a cheap one off Rose. It\u2019s launched long, and Aurier is forced to head out for a corner on the left. When it\u2019s taken, Rose shanks a clearance backwards and out of play for a second corner. From which ... 80 min: Burnley make a double change, replacing Hendrick and McNeil on the flanks with Gudmundsson and Brady. 79 min: Rose dribbles down the left, and hooks into the mixer. Llorente fancies it, but Heaton wants it more. A fine claim under pressure. 77 min: Spurs pile forward, then are caught short at the back, Wood romping into acres on the right. His low cross is met by McNeil, coming in from the other flank. He shoots low and hard; Lloris parries well. Spurs hack out for a corner, which comes to nothing. This is set up perfectly now. The last few minutes of this match promise much in the way of weird and wonderful entertainment! 76 min: This is manic, end-to-end fare now. Aurier dribbles around near the byline to the right of the Burnley goal, and takes two attempts at a cross. Neither is any good. Spurs then make their second change, replacing Foyth with Lamela. They\u2019re going for this now! 75 min: A cute turn down the inside-right channel by Hendrick, and Burnley are away. Barnes is teed up to the right of the D. His low shot is blocked out for a corner. From the set piece, hit long from the right, Tarkowski rises highest at the far post, and attempts to guide a header into the top right. There\u2019s not enough juice on it, and Lloris claims the looping effort easily. 74 min: Aurier crosses from deep; it\u2019s blocked by Taylor, and that\u2019s a corner for Spurs. Eriksen works it to Aurier, who drives it into a crowded box from the right. Burnley somehow get it clear. 72 min: Re-read the entry for 69 min, replacing Foyth for Bardsley and Wood for Rose. It\u2019s uncanny. Bardsley is now another player fortunate to escape with just a yellow, and Dean remains stuck on 99. 70 min: Hendrick blasts a witless free kick into the Spurs wall. But the hosts are soon coming back at Spurs, Wood flicking a pass right for Hendrick, who whips a shot across the face of goal and inches wide of the bottom left. 69 min: Foyth is booked for a late slide on Wood. That could have been Mike Dean\u2019s 100th red, because the young Spurs defender was flying through the air, studs showing. But it\u2019s just yellow, and Dean\u2019s still on 99. The fact there wasn\u2019t much contact, and Foyth looked to be pulling out of the challenge at the last, might have influenced that decision. 67 min: Now it\u2019s Sean Dyche\u2019s turn to lose the plot on the touchline, sure that Rose had nicked a few yards at the throw. Both teams might have got away with one. Spurs are back in it! And a little controversy about this one, too, as Rose steals a couple of yards at a quick throw-in on the left, in order to set Kane scampering free! He\u2019s got the beating of Mee, holding his man off as he enters the box. Kane draws Heaton and slips a cute finish across the keeper and into the bottom right! He\u2019s back, baby. Oh he\u2019s back. 64 min: A corner for Spurs on the left. Rose is teed up, to the left of the D; his shot is blocked and deflects out for another corner. The second set piece is slammed upfield by Bardsley. Llorente\u2019s first act of the afternoon is to slam into Mee, while contesting a high ball, and he\u2019s immediately in the book. 62 min: Spurs have to throw the kitchen sink at this. Pochettino withdraws Winks and sends on Llorente. 61 min: So the replay of the award of that corner will be shown more than once, I\u2019ll be bound. Especially if Spurs can\u2019t turn this around. Kind of a shame that it\u2019ll eclipse another replay, shown just before the goal: a nice moment between Kane and Heaton, the striker congratulating the keeper on his save on 50 minutes, the keeper warmly slapping the striker on the back in awe of his fine shot. All in the heat of battle. 59 min: That\u2019s Wood\u2019s seventh goal in his last ten games. Will it scupper Tottenham\u2019s title challenge? The visitors had been much the better side in the opening exchanges of the second half, but now look! On the touchline, Pochettino is beyond livid, claiming that the corner should never have been awarded. Hendrick had gone sliding in with Vertonghen, and he\u2019s insistent the ball came off the Burnley man last. The officials didn\u2019t agree. Westwood whips the corner in from the right. Wood rises highest, six yards out, and plants a header flush in the top-left corner! The ball comes down off the bar and over the line, Lloris with no chance! 56 min: Mee romps down the left and crosses into the Spurs area. McNeil tries to bring it down to shoot, but there\u2019s not enough time for that. The ball breaks to Hendrick on the right, and he earns a corner. From which ... 54 min: Kane scampers after a long blootered clearance. Heaton bravely comes out of his area to head clear before the striker can start causing trouble. 53 min: Spurs keep probing. Foyth bursts down the right channel and is knocked over by Mee. A free kick, just to the right of centre, 25 yards out. Eriksen floats it diagonally towards Foyth, who heads harmlessly over from the middle of a thicket. 51 min: Spurs take the corner and ping it around awhile. Aurier tries to cross from the right, but the ball clanks into Taylor. He wants a penalty for handball, but he\u2019s not getting it. 50 min: Space for Kane to wander into, down the inside-right channel. Nobody closes him down, though he\u2019s got no options. No matter! From 30 yards, he sends a rising swerver towards the top left, a wondrous heatseeker! Heaton, at full stretch, tips spectacularly round the post. What a shot, and a save to match! 48 min: Son crosses from the left and the ball is slammed into the stand behind the Burnley goal by Tarkowski. No nonsense. The set piece is played short, Son eventually pulling one back to tee up Rose, who is steaming in. He shoots, but Cork is right up in his grille to block. 46 min: A positive start to the half from Spurs, as Rose turns Hendrick inside out, like an old sock. His twinkletoes make it to the byline, but his cutback isn\u2019t so good and Burnley clear. A clear sign that Spurs want these three points! In the context of the title race, they really need them. We\u2019re off again! Spurs get the second half underway. No changes. \u201cNever mind who Mike Dean shows his 100th red card to; what for is the question,\u201d argues Ian Sargeant. \u201cIs he waiting for something cast iron - a headbutt, a two-footed lunge or a clear professional foul perhaps? Or something utterly pedantic, like a second yellow for re-entering the field of play without permission?\u201d Yes, you make a good point here. Ideally, the red card will be thoroughly pedantic, presented with a ludicrous theatrical flourish, and later proved to be preposterously incorrect. That would be nice, wouldn\u2019t it. Good old Mike Dean. Half-time entertainment. Some magical memories of matches between these two famous names of English football, courtesy of Burnley regular Iain Noble. Enjoy! \u201cThere were some cracking matches between these two teams in the late 50s and early 60s, many of which I was lucky enough to see. The Clarets were desperately unlucky in the 61-62 season. I saw just about every home game they played (I was 12) and they were just irresistible for the first half of the season, wonderful football from probably their greatest-ever side. \u201cBut there were a lot of cancellations because of a particularly hard winter and, along with their FA Cup run (several replays), the fixtures and injuries piled up and up. With the small squads of those days, they were gradually worn down and couldn\u2019t seem to do anything else but draw. Even then they could have got back against Spurs in the FA Cup final but for a very debatable penalty late on. \u201cThe next season for the third round of the Cup they were drawn away at Spurs. They won 3-0. But the match I remember best at Turf Moor - apart from my first in April \u201961 which was their win 4-2 against Spurs after being 2-0 down at half time, a score that even the official Spurs history says was \u2018very much against the run of play\u2019 - was in April 1964. We stuffed Spurs 7-2. Oh my, Pointer and my McIlroy long ago!\u201d Title-chasing Spurs go in at the break slightly frustrated. They\u2019ve been the better side, just, but haven\u2019t seriously worked Heaton. Can they up it in the second half, and move to within two points of Manchester City and Liverpool? Stay with us to find out! 43 min: Barnes comes off second best in a challenge with Eriksen and wins a free kick for his trouble, out on the right. Westwood sends it into the Spurs box, and there\u2019s a brief game of head tennis, but nothing that seriously troubles the visitors. Lloris hasn\u2019t had a great deal to do. 41 min: Spurs are beginning to hog the ball. Nothing\u2019s quite coming off for them, though. Rose bustles his way down the left, and nearly breaks clear, but Hendrick is a study in determination and eventually forces the Spurs man to run the ball out of play. 39 min: Spurs are beginning to ask questions, though. Now Rose skedaddles down the left and crosses deep for Aurier, who sends a weak header straight at Heaton. One the keeper can throw his cap on. 38 min: Spurs pass and probe, probe and pass. Aurier then lifts a cross in from the right, finding Kane on the penalty spot. It\u2019d take some header from there, and he does his best, but the effort floats harmlessly into the arms of Heaton. 37 min: McNeil strips Aurier out on the left. For a second, it looks as though he\u2019s going to tear clear, but doesn\u2019t trust himself in a footrace with Foyth, and overhits a cross towards Wood on the other wing. The danger\u2019s over. 36 min: Eriksen, quarterbacking from deep, loops a long pass down the inside-left channel. Kane is this close to getting on the end of it, but Heaton comes out to smother. Kane is beginning to warm up now, getting back up to speed nicely. 34 min: Son embarks on a rococo dribble down the right, and tiptoes along the tightrope of the byline. It\u2019s a glorious dribble, lovely ball control while surrounded by claret shirts, and he eventually slides a pass across the face of goal, Heaton having been drawn towards him. But there\u2019s nobody in white to take advantage. Bardsley half-clears, then Eriksen sends a poor shot wide left. 33 min: Chances at both ends! Eriksen sends a low shot towards the bottom left; there\u2019s little power in it, and Heaton claims easily. Then Hendrick makes good down the right and crosses low for Barnes, who flashes a first-time shot across Lloris, looking for the top left, and over the bar. 31 min: Rose is now cast in the role of pantomime villain after that sit-down protest. So the crowd enjoy it very much when he runs the ball out of play for a goal kick when in a promising position on the left. \u201cWhat do reckon the chances are of us witnessing the historic occasion of Mike Dean dishing out his 100th red card?\u201d wonders J.R. in Illinois. \u201cI always like Ashley Barnes\u2019 chances of walking. He has, in the parlance of legendary former Chicago White Sox announcer Hawk Harrelson\u2019s parlance, a carmine derriere. My second choice would be Aurier. I don\u2019t care for him.\u201d For pure comedic value, it would surely have to be England\u2019s Harry Kane. I accept Spurs fans might not concur. 30 min: Burnley enjoy a little period of possession. They don\u2019t really go anywhere, but after that brouhaha in the box, it\u2019s a chance to clear heads and rediscover their equilibrium. 28 min: While Rose sits and complains, Spurs win a corner down the right. The set piece leads to a bit of pinball in the Burnley area, instigated by Son, but eventually the hosts manage to hack clear. Rose gets up. 27 min: Rose is clattered by Hendrick and stays down for quite some time. But play goes on, much to the Spurs defender\u2019s irritation. 25 min: Kane barges into Tarkowski as the England internationals contest a high ball. It\u2019s a clear foul, but that doesn\u2019t stop Kane feigning affront. The referee\u2019s not having a bar of it. A little frustration betrayed there; Spurs still aren\u2019t quite clicking, back after their break. 23 min: Space for Barnes out on the left as he rolls Foyth with ease. He reaches the byline and fizzes a fine ball through the six-yard box, but Wood has dropped off in expectation of the cutback, instead of gambling on the front foot. Spurs get away with one there. 21 min: Aurier crosses for Son again from the right. Son attempts a spectacular bicycle kick, but the chain comes flying off, the gears slip, and he goes over the handlebars. A fresh-air swipe. Rose tries to retrieve the situation but bowls Hendrick to the ground, and the first serious period of Spurs pressure comes to an end. 20 min: Eriksen spreads a pass wide right for Aurier, who crosses towards Son. The striker can\u2019t quite connect, and Burnley hack clear, but for a second it looked like a gilt-edged chance from ten yards. 18 min: Spurs have settled a little now. Foyth bursts between a couple of claret shirts and romps upfield. He leaves the ball to Eriksen, who has a little think, probing here and there. Nothing opens up for him, and the move eventually breaks down, but the visitors were struggling to hold onto the ball for a while, so this is a move in the right direction. 16 min: But finally they get something going, and nearly score! Son and Sissoko combine down the right. Sissoko slides a pass inside for Kane, who drops a shoulder and turn on the boosters. He makes for the box, heading diagonally to the left of the D, then pearls a low shot inches wide of the bottom left. He\u2019s back. 15 min: Spurs are a little staccato at the moment. Moves of over two passes at a premium. Burnley are hounding them relentlessly. 13 min: Lloris is all over the place at the moment. A couple of panics under his crossbar already, and now he slices a simple clearance straight out of play. Another chance for Burnley to build something from a throw deep in Spurs territory; another chance that comes to nothing. 11 min: McNeil takes the ball off Aurier out on the Burnley left, pressing near the corner flag. He loops a cross to the far post, where Hendrick awaits. Lloris, dazzled by the sun, struggles to tip the ball away from under his own bar. But he just about manages it, and the whistle goes for a foul anyway. 10 min: Foyth battles Barnes down the left. He gets his shirt ripped, but the free kick goes to Burnley. Westwood hoicks the set piece into the box; Aurier clears for a corner ... ah no, it\u2019s a throw, even though Burnley get set for the kick. Nothing comes of the throw, Spurs shepherding the hosts away from their danger zone. 8 min: Cork bowls Kane over in the midfield. A garden variety foul, but hearts would have been in mouths on the Spurs bench as Kane took a few seconds to get up. He\u2019s fine, though. 7 min: A lovely low whipped cross into the Burnley box from the left by Rose. Kane is still getting used to football again, not quite up to speed, and is on his heels as Heaton gathers. 6 min: It\u2019s a little scrappy. The ball bobbles around in front of the Spurs box. Westwood has a speculative whack, but his shot is blocked the second it leaves his boot and dribbles through to Lloris. 4 min: A couple of heavy challenges, Hendrick on Rose and Aurier on Taylor. All hard but fair enough, fouls but no need for cards. A sign that this match will be keenly contested, like we needed confirmation. 2 min: But Burnley are made of strong stuff, and they shake off the rust quicksmart. Wood works his way down the left and earns the first corner of the match. Westwood nearly scores direct from it! His inswinger forces Lloris to tip over the bar. But there\u2019s been some pushing and shoving and it\u2019s a free kick instead of another corner. A lively start. And we\u2019re off! The hosts get proceedings underway. Westwood knocks the kick-off back to Tarkowski, who takes a heavy touch and is nearly stripped of possession by Son! He gets away with it, just. But that\u2019s a nervous start by Burnley, and an early statement of intent by Spurs. The teams are out! Burnley wear their famous claret shirts, while Spurs are also dressed in their storied first-choice garb. A good old-school atmosphere at a fine old-school ground. We\u2019ll be off in two ticks! Mauricio Pochettino also has a quick chat. \u201cAfter two training sessions I had no doubt, Kane is fully fit to play. He is one of the best strikers in the world, and he has a massive impact. But we do not put all the pressure on his shoulders.\u201d Sean Dyche talks to Sky. \u201cHarry Kane is a top striker, I\u2019ve spoken openly about that for a few years now. But I think behind that, there\u2019s a very good side. So it\u2019s not a one-man team. They are very good with or without him. But we\u2019ve come across many good sides in the Premier League and we know it\u2019s a big challenge, and that we have to focus on ourselves. What happened in the early stages of the season has been parked, and there\u2019s a freshness and a clarity in the group going into the second half of the season.\u201d It\u2019s a lovely day in Lancashire. Yellow beams streaming into Turf Moor and all across this famous old mill town. And oh dear! This chap appears to have caught the sun. It serves as a warning to us all. Remember your Ambre Solaire, kids, those UV rays can be a bugger. Burnley name the same side that dispatched Brighton with ease a fortnight ago. Peter Crouch still kicking his heels on the bench, there, but what can you do when Chris Wood and Ashley Barnes played so well in that 3-1 win at the Amex? The big news for Spurs, meanwhile, is: he\u2019s back! Harry Kane returns after his injury lay-off. He\u2019s one of two changes to the XI that steamrollered Borussia Dortmund in the second half of a sensational Champions League performance at Wembley the other week. He replaces Lucas Moura, while Danny Rose comes in for Davison Sanchez. Burnley: Heaton, Bardsley, Tarkowski, Mee, Taylor, Hendrick, Westwood, Cork, McNeil, Barnes, Wood. Subs: Lowton, Gudmundsson, Brady, Gibson, Crouch, Hart, Vydra. Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Foyth, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Aurier, Sissoko, Winks, Rose, Eriksen, Kane, Son. Subs: Lamela, Wanyama, Walker-Peters, Llorente, Gazzaniga, Lucas Moura, Davies. Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral). \u201cThis is like a final for us.\u201d Mauricio Pochettino there, hoping his Tottenham Hotspur side claim all three points at Burnley this lunchtime, in the hope of piling pressure on Manchester City and Liverpool at the top of the table. He\u2019ll be hoping this pans out like one final in particular. The 1962 FA Cup final, to be precise. Tottenham beat Burnley in that one 3-1, Jimmy Greaves scoring early, Bobby Smith and Danny Blanchflower sealing the deal after Jimmy Robson had equalised in the second half for the Clarets. Burnley could have won the Double that season, but capitulated during the title run-in to gift the league to Alf Ramsey\u2019s Ipswich Town. Different times. But we digress. Harry Kane may be back from injury to assist the title push. But this isn\u2019t just about Spurs. Burnley aren\u2019t safe from relegation quite yet, and are desirous of three precious points themselves. They\u2019re undefeated in seven in the league, while Spurs have lost two of their last three away from home. It\u2019s a tough assignment for the title hopefuls, but they\u2019ll take succour from the fact they\u2019ve won on their last two visits to Turf Moor. This is poised deliciously. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.30pm BST.",

      "body": "<p>I grew up in post-war Britain when, saved from German invasion \u2013 men returned from war, children from evacuation, families were reunited \u2013 the comfort of the home became paramount. Its importance was marked out in sewn domestic niceties: embroidered tray cloths, cheval sets and tea cosies. My home had a sewing machine in the corner, an ever-ready sewing workbox by my mother\u2019s chair and a box that brimmed with buttons for us children to rifle through by way of entertainment. This was my material world.</p> <p>Living in industrial Glasgow, a city grimed with soot, smog and smoke, my landscape was monochrome until the day, when I was about six years old, my mother took me to an Aladdin\u2019s cave in the city centre. There she bought me linen cloths already stamped with floral flourishes, packets of gold-tipped needles and silver scissors with handles shaped like a bird\u2019s wings \u2013 and she let me choose loops of embroidery threads from a carousel of colours that dazzled me.</p> <p>I had never seen so many hues of green, such a variance of red, blues that stretched from daybreak to midnight skies and all the shades in between. It was a revelation. On my way home, I held my trove of colours tight in my hand. Such a rainbow was treasure and it was mine. When there was little I could call my own, this bundle of sewing materials represented not just luxury but the thrill of sole ownership.</p> <p>Even today, I cannot pass a display of embroidery threads without my heart missing a beat. Sometimes I even dream about textiles. I trail my hand through long-forgotten fabrics \u2013 crepe de chine, duchess satin, tulle net \u2013 grazing my knuckles on a crust of beading, smoothing down lengths of fringing and stroking the braille of lace. When I wake, it is always with the sharp pang of loss because the textiles I touch in my dreams have never existed, so there\u2019s no hope of their rediscovery.</p> <p><em><strong>It was my mother</strong></em> who taught me how to sew. She guided me through the simplest of stitches \u2013 back stitch, blanket stitch, lazy daisy, French knots \u2013 and, through them, I discovered another way of writing, inscribing my cloth with motifs and patterns that seemed to speak of an elsewhere, a world more delicate than the rough and tumble of my own.</p> <p>My dolls became dressed in sumptuous gowns encrusted with beads; the clothes I eventually learned to make for myself were graced with decorative stitchery. I liked the demands of embroidery, its requirement for concentration, its quietude. Its absorption offered me a retreat from the bluster of family life. Being the youngest of four children I had no place of my own. I shared a bedroom with my sisters and was squeezed among my three siblings in the back seat of the car. Grouped, as we were, by my parents into \u201cyou four\u201d or \u201cyou children\u201d, any sense of separateness was elusive.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Needlework gave me space. It cocooned me in my own privacy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But, through sewing, I could delineate a personal physical space. Needlework cocooned me in a privacy of sorts and while I have never lost my love of sewing as a private pleasure, in my chosen career path as a community artist, I made my sewing into a public art. Through sewing, I devised projects to involve socially marginalised people, encouraging them to create large-scale banners and wall hangings so they could tell the stories of their lives. I discovered a different kind of peacefulness in community sewing: the collective concentration and camaraderie of a common endeavour.</p> <p>When I began to research my book, exploring the social, emotional and political significance of sewing, I discovered that during the Second World War, women who had crafted quilts and signature cloths in POW camps hadn\u2019t made them in jolly spirit-reviving sewing bees. Instead, each woman sewed privately, reclaiming solitude and individual expression among the overcrowded and claustrophobic atmosphere of a camp where they were registered as a number. Through their embroidery they made time for themselves and through their sewn autographs they asserted their identity.</p> <p>I read about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jun/13/victoriabrittain\" title=\"\">Ruth First</a>, the anti-apartheid campaigner who, faced with long-term imprisonment in solitary confinement, took up needlework to take control of her time. On the back of her lapel she stitched seven black lines to mark her days, but then would unpick one or two as if to gain time, or go forward at her own pace by sewing down the days that lay ahead. Hers was an act of both rebellion and self-preservation.</p> <p>Today, in prisons throughout Britain, the organisation <a href=\"https://finecellwork.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Fine Cell Work</a> involves hundreds of men in embroidering items to sell online or make to commission. Paid for what they create, these men also stitch alone in their cells, finding respite from the clang and boom of prison life in the small oasis of peace afforded them by the rhythmic, repetitive act of sewing.

      "bodyText": "I grew up in post-war Britain when, saved from German invasion \u2013 men returned from war, children from evacuation, families were reunited \u2013 the comfort of the home became paramount. Its importance was marked out in sewn domestic niceties: embroidered tray cloths, cheval sets and tea cosies. My home had a sewing machine in the corner, an ever-ready sewing workbox by my mother\u2019s chair and a box that brimmed with buttons for us children to rifle through by way of entertainment. This was my material world. Living in industrial Glasgow, a city grimed with soot, smog and smoke, my landscape was monochrome until the day, when I was about six years old, my mother took me to an Aladdin\u2019s cave in the city centre. There she bought me linen cloths already stamped with floral flourishes, packets of gold-tipped needles and silver scissors with handles shaped like a bird\u2019s wings \u2013 and she let me choose loops of embroidery threads from a carousel of colours that dazzled me. I had never seen so many hues of green, such a variance of red, blues that stretched from daybreak to midnight skies and all the shades in between. It was a revelation. On my way home, I held my trove of colours tight in my hand. Such a rainbow was treasure and it was mine. When there was little I could call my own, this bundle of sewing materials represented not just luxury but the thrill of sole ownership. Even today, I cannot pass a display of embroidery threads without my heart missing a beat. Sometimes I even dream about textiles. I trail my hand through long-forgotten fabrics \u2013 crepe de chine, duchess satin, tulle net \u2013 grazing my knuckles on a crust of beading, smoothing down lengths of fringing and stroking the braille of lace. When I wake, it is always with the sharp pang of loss because the textiles I touch in my dreams have never existed, so there\u2019s no hope of their rediscovery. It was my mother who taught me how to sew. She guided me through the simplest of stitches \u2013 back stitch, blanket stitch, lazy daisy, French knots \u2013 and, through them, I discovered another way of writing, inscribing my cloth with motifs and patterns that seemed to speak of an elsewhere, a world more delicate than the rough and tumble of my own. My dolls became dressed in sumptuous gowns encrusted with beads; the clothes I eventually learned to make for myself were graced with decorative stitchery. I liked the demands of embroidery, its requirement for concentration, its quietude. Its absorption offered me a retreat from the bluster of family life. Being the youngest of four children I had no place of my own. I shared a bedroom with my sisters and was squeezed among my three siblings in the back seat of the car. Grouped, as we were, by my parents into \u201cyou four\u201d or \u201cyou children\u201d, any sense of separateness was elusive. But, through sewing, I could delineate a personal physical space. Needlework cocooned me in a privacy of sorts and while I have never lost my love of sewing as a private pleasure, in my chosen career path as a community artist, I made my sewing into a public art. Through sewing, I devised projects to involve socially marginalised people, encouraging them to create large-scale banners and wall hangings so they could tell the stories of their lives. I discovered a different kind of peacefulness in community sewing: the collective concentration and camaraderie of a common endeavour. When I began to research my book, exploring the social, emotional and political significance of sewing, I discovered that during the Second World War, women who had crafted quilts and signature cloths in POW camps hadn\u2019t made them in jolly spirit-reviving sewing bees. Instead, each woman sewed privately, reclaiming solitude and individual expression among the overcrowded and claustrophobic atmosphere of a camp where they were registered as a number. Through their embroidery they made time for themselves and through their sewn autographs they asserted their identity. I read about Ruth First, the anti-apartheid campaigner who, faced with long-term imprisonment in solitary confinement, took up needlework to take control of her time. On the back of her lapel she stitched seven black lines to mark her days, but then would unpick one or two as if to gain time, or go forward at her own pace by sewing down the days that lay ahead. Hers was an act of both rebellion and self-preservation. Today, in prisons throughout Britain, the organisation Fine Cell Work involves hundreds of men in embroidering items to sell online or make to commission. Paid for what they create, these men also stitch alone in their cells, finding respite from the clang and boom of prison life in the small oasis of peace afforded them by the rhythmic, repetitive act of sewing. Their needlework brings them sensory salve in the silken slip of thread and the soft crumble of cloth, a tactile antidote to the harsh and hard environment that surrounds them. After the First World War, doctors experimented with getting shell-shocked soldiers to embroider as a way of healing mental scars and it proved a surprisingly effective way of steadying their hands and settling their minds. The Disabled Soldiers\u2019 Embroidery Industry was established offering war-torn ex-servicemen, isolated in their homes or in makeshift hospitals, the opportunity to earn some much-needed income and rebuild their self-esteem. From the unlikely marriage of men of war and fine needlework, occupational therapy was born and has remained a mainstay of medical practice ever since. There have been many studies exploring the relationship between creativity and well-being: the benefits, particularly for those suffering from mental illness, of the mesmeric immersion in crafts as a relief from inner turmoil.

In the time and contemplation taken \u2013 embroidering an angel, her skirt strewn with poppies of remembrance, her arms wrapped protectively around a child \u2013 I found another way to mourn, a solace of sorts. When my sister and I sat with our dying mother, for four days and nights I sewed. Although, by that time, she was in a coma, I like to believe she sensed our presence, heard me describing my work-in-progress and acknowledging the skill she had passed on to me.

It is about what Graciela Iturbide saw when she was taking photographs around the world, nothing more,\u201d she says. \u201cI am showing how I interpret things through all the influences in my life.\u201d These include her unshakable fascination with what she calls the \u201cparaphernalia of religion\u201d and ritual, which she maintains despite being an atheist. She says its roots in her childhood as the eldest of 13 children in a strict, religious and well-to-do Mexico City family are just too deep, though long since transformed by her creative independence. The foundations for that freedom lay in her break for liberty at 19 when she married a \u201crelatively liberal man\u201d. Then, after having three children in quick succession, she went to film school and took a class with renowned photographer Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo. \u201c\u00c1lvarez Bravo taught me another way to live,\u201d she says, downplaying what her mentor taught her about photographic technique. Now, at the age of 76, Iturbide, who has been described as \u201cone of the most important and influential Latin American photographers of the past four decades, who continues to inspire a younger generation of photographers\u201d, is spending time revisiting old projects, particularly outside Mexico. These include returning to photograph a group of deaf people within an east LA street gang she first captured on film in her contribution to a 1987 book called A Day in the Life of America. She is currently planning a trip to take pictures of them visiting the grave of a recently deceased female leader. \u201cI like to maintain a relationship with people I have worked with,\u201d she says. \u201cThe experience with them has been very lovely.\u201d The ever-present importance of time and ritual in Iturbide\u2019s work is also there in her unflinching loyalty to shooting with film. For one thing, she knows that the mysterious surprises she seeks in the field can also lurk on a contact sheet. That\u2019s what happened with the famed image of a Seri indigenous woman heading down a mountain with the Sonoran desert in northern Mexico stretching out below her. \u201cIt\u2019s my favourite photograph, because I don\u2019t remember taking it,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cMaybe it was some kind of spirit out there that took it.\u201d Graciela Iturbide\u2019s Mexico is published by MFA Publications (\u00a338.32/$49.95)",

      "body": "<p>Fashion is supposed to be, among other things, about taste. But good taste can only take a person so far. As Diana Vreeland had it: \u201cVulgarity is a very important ingredient in life.\u201d Vreeland, who edited American <em>Vogue</em> in the Sixties, believed in vulgarity almost as passionately as she believed in red and pink and well-polished shoes. Without it, one might easily die of boredom: \u201cA little bad taste is like a nice splash of paprika. We all need a splash of bad taste \u2026. No taste is what I\u2019m against.\u201d</p> <p>When the death of the designer Karl Lagerfeld from cancer was announced on Tuesday, I thought of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/diana-vreeland\" title=\"\">Vreeland</a>, his only real rival in fashion when it comes to wit (not that there\u2019s much competition). The two of them had various things in common: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/mar/25/karl-lagerfeld-genius-modern-fashion-chanel\" title=\"\">their striking, not to say odd, looks</a>; their tendency to adjust their biographies; their aptitude for dashing, if ultimately meaningless, pronouncements. Above all, they both understood that good taste needs always to be leavened with a dash of bad: a little something to raise carefully manicured eyebrows. Look at a photograph of almost any collection designed by Lagerfeld and, even as you admire this jacket, that dress, there will always be one detail \u2013 a few too many pearls, a frill that is, well, simply too frilly \u2013 that falls into the category of vulgar.</p> <p>Such vulgarity \u2013 or bad taste, call it what you will \u2013 was ever-present in his own realm, too: the ponytail, the fingerless gloves, the diamante belt buckles. Lagerfeld, a walking, talking pageant of high and low, liked to mix it up: an urge born of the confidence that comes with being cultured in a world (fashion) where culture is not always at a premium. He knew all about opera, furniture and architecture. The owner of a vast library, he could read in several languages.</p> <p>He collected, among other things, jewellery designed by the great Suzanne Belperron, whose clients included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/oct/31/featuresreview.review6\" title=\"\">Colette</a> and Jean Cocteau. Why should he care what others thought of his too-tight jeans matched with a tuxedo? Of the tie upon which an image of his beloved Birman cat, Choupette, had been carefully embroidered, presumably by one of his own obliging <em>petites mains</em>?</p> <p>Lagerfeld was born in Hamburg in 1933. His father, Otto, made his money from condensed milk; his mother, Elisabeth, was a former lingerie saleswoman who seemingly styled herself as a Cruella de Vil-style figure (it was <em>Mutti</em> dearest who told Karl his hands were ugly, hence the gloves). Naturally, this did not dismay her son; in fact, it rather turned him on. In interviews, he claimed to have relished her sternness, her impatience, her plain speaking \u2013 and, to a degree, he aped them. To her we may trace Lagerfeld\u2019s workaholism (he designed some 14 collections a year), his way with insults (\u201cI think tattoos are horrible \u2013 it\u2019s like living in a Pucci dress full time\u201d), and his fear of abandonment (he fell out with his muse, the French model <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2013/oct/15/ines-de-la-fressange-chic-five-items-wardrobe\" title=\"\">In\u00e8s de la Fressange</a>, when she married, unable to share her).</p> <p>Having left home at 14, Lagerfeld finished his education in Paris. Already in thrall to fashion, and an excellent sketcher, in 1954, his design for a woollen coat received a prize from the Secr\u00e9tariat International de la Laine, an award he shared with Yves St Laurent, later to become his life-long rival (St Laurent had created a dress). Apprenticed to Balmain, one of its judges, he then worked at Jean Patou. In 1964, he joined Chlo\u00e9, the first of two stints at the label; in 1965, he joined the furrier Fendi, with whom he stayed until his death. Finally, in 1983, he arrived at Chanel.</p> <p>The label was then in the doldrums, reliant on sales of scent and suits to middle-aged women (Coco had died in 1971).

As a feminist who loves clothes, and thinks they\u2019re important \u2013 as someone once said, they are the furniture of the mind made visible and, on occasion, the very mirror of an epoch\u2019s soul \u2013 I see it from both sides: the brilliance at the drawing board, and the bully who didn\u2019t like to see his female employees in flat shoes. One doesn\u2019t necessarily cancel out the other. And he will be sorely missed. It\u2019s fantastic that so many women are now running the big houses: making clothes for their own gender, with all the sympathy that involves. But Lagerfeld is the last of the last. After him, there is only marketing, PR-speak and certain boredom.",

      "body": "<p>The waiting game can be long and lonely \u2013 just ask Little Simz. The 25-year-old rapper has released two albums and will drop her third, <em>Grey Area</em>, this week. There have been props from Kendrick Lamar \u2013 who once called her \u201cthe illest doing it right now\u201d \u2013 and tours with Lauryn Hill and Nas. A spot on Forbes\u2019s prestigious 30 Under 30 list. A track with Gorillaz and another that was featured on hit HBO TV show <em>Insecure</em>. And yet for the past nine years, Simz, AKA Simbi Ajikawo, has evaded household-name fame. Her last album, 2017\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/01/little-simz-stillness-in-wonderland-review-poison-ivy-lmpd-bad-to-the-bone-space-age-collective\" title=\"\"><em>Stillness </em><em>in Wonderland</em></a>, was reviewed positively but didn\u2019t reach the Top 100. Her star has risen in tandem with grime\u2019s renaissance and yet that hasn\u2019t translated into the kind of accolades given to Stormzy and Skepta. You do not see her name atop festival bills like her contemporaries J Hus and AJ Tracey. \u201cThe silence surrounding Little Simz\u2019s name,\u201d <a href=\"https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/xdwkpq/little-simz-is-pioneering-uk-rap-so-why-wont-the-industry-support-her\" title=\"\">said one critic</a>, \u201chas become deafening.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps that\u2019s because the north Londoner was always a touch ahead of her time. Born to Nigerian parents in Islington, Simz starred in various television shows and released a whopping five EPs before her first album, in 2015. That was long before Cardi B had charted with Bodak Yellow and Stefflon Don sashayed on to sold-out tours. Simz was making weird, narrative hip-hop with bold concepts (<em>Stillness </em><em>in Wonderland </em>came with a graphic novel, an exhibition and festival) before triple-threats like Kojey Radical bounced forth, blurring the boundaries between performance artist, poet and rapper. Her tunes trilled with trumpets before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/08/british-jazz-invasion-moses-boyd-matthew-halsall-nubya-garcia\" title=\"\">the UK jazz scene</a> properly erupted and made those sounds popular once more. (She has also, it\u2019s important to stress, remained independent throughout, self-releasing her records through her Age 101 imprint.)</p> <p>Or maybe it\u2019s because Little Simz\u2019s sound hasn\u2019t hit the right note yet. There is a lot to be said about the fight to occupy a space when your male peers are taking up all the room, especially in the bloke-heavy world of rap. Women, for the most part, have had to create new paths while their male counterparts get given a free pass down the established ones \u2013 even more so, it seems, when your image is not overtly sexualised. Simz\u2019s approach has been to explore the areas in-between \u2013 mixing up genres, being more experimental than her peers \u2013 but it has sometimes been to uncertain effect.</p> <p>At first, her music was lumped in with grime, but in fact it cast around for other sounds: dubstep, jazz, down-tempo hip-hop, neo-soul. Reviews, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/18/little-simz-review-red-hot-ambition-and-technical-flair-islington-academy\" title=\"\">my own in 2015</a>, suggested that while she had undeniable technical flair, Simz still had to \u201cfind her voice\u201d.</p> <p>By which they meant, partly, that she didn\u2019t quite fit in with whatever was currently going on in music. Maybe Simz didn\u2019t break through because female MCs used to be a hard sell. Maybe it\u2019s because she wasn\u2019t grime enough for grime fans but too grime for, say, 6 Music listeners (the type that like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/young-fathers\" title=\"\">Young Fathers</a>). But while her last album, brave and huge in scope, was certainly incomparable to anything else at the time, it\u2019s also possible that she just needed some bigger tunes.</p> <p>On <em>Grey Area</em>, those are in abundance. It swings. It grooves. It\u2019s not bogged down by a self-consciously poetic concept. And it feels like a record rather than a showcase, anchored by the production work of Simz\u2019s childhood friend Inflo. He is the Timbaland to her Missy, and gives her songs the glue they needed. Born <a href=\"http://www.alexbaranowski.com/bio/\" title=\"\">Alex Baranowski</a>, the producer and film composer seems to have taken notes while working with Danger Mouse on Michael Kiwanuka\u2019s 2016 album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/17/michael-kiwanuka-love-hate-album-review\" title=\"\"><em>Love &amp; Hate</em></a> (in an industry game of tag, Kiwanuka appears on <em>Grey Area</em>\u2019s final track, Flowers). There are big, chunky breaks, fat funk dollops, the crackle of US soul, touches of cosmic jazz and cinematic strings \u2013 also reminiscent of Adrian Younge\u2019s work with Ghostface Killah. The lead tune, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpfpGwklQ6k\" title=\"\">101 FM</a>, features the best instrumental since Stormzy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqQGUJK7Na4\" title=\"\">Shut Up</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSSKDIcpdSE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iSSKDIcpdSE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSSKDIcpdSE\">Watch the video for Selfish by Little Simz.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Simz, meanwhile, has unlocked a new level of versatility. Her tracks were always soberingly serious, but here there is humour, and songs that border on the feelgood. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOjyGr01VZ4\" title=\"\">Offence</a> is Simz at her most Missy, deadpanning playfully bravado lines such as \u201cI\u2019m Jay-Z on a bad day, Shakespeare on my worst days\u201d over a deliciously grainy Quincy bassline. On Boss, she hollers through a megaphone like a whooping bluesman as she takes out the men who distract her.</p> <p>Simz has said in interviews that she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/07/islington-mc-little-simz\" title=\"\">dislikes being referred to as a \u201cfemale MC\u201d</a>, but gender inequality has proved a fertile ground: on Venom, she spits \u201cthey don\u2019t wanna address that I\u2019m the best here for the mere fact that I\u2019ve got ovaries\u201d over taut, horror-score strings. Men, she continues, never give women credit because they \u201cdon\u2019t like pussy in power\u201d. She is not quite the voice of a generation \u2013 her tracks are too inward-looking for that \u2013 but she could be, given time. On Wounds, with a pleasing croon from Jamaica\u2019s Chronixx on the chorus, her bars survey gang crime and gun violence with a detached brilliance.</p> <p>Simz has said that making <em>Grey Area</em> was \u201clike therapy\u201d, after a dark spell where she questioned the isolation of trying to, as the cliche goes, make her own way. Smidgens of her struggle with alienation and questioning her career path pepper her tracks \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m so selfish,\u201d goes Cleo Sol\u2019s sweetly sung chorus on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSSKDIcpdSE\" title=\"\">Selfish</a>, while Flowers looks at the \u201c27 club\u201d of dead stars and wonders what the real price of fame is.</p> <p>Mega-stardom might never be hers in the end, but <em>Grey Area</em> sets out a different kind of stall anyway: Little Simz is a slow-burner, and now that she\u2019s found a slicker sound, there\u2019s no telling where she might go.</p>",

Simz was making weird, narrative hip-hop with bold concepts (Stillness in Wonderland came with a graphic novel, an exhibition and festival) before triple-threats like Kojey Radical bounced forth, blurring the boundaries between performance artist, poet and rapper. Her tunes trilled with trumpets before the UK jazz scene properly erupted and made those sounds popular once more. (She has also, it\u2019s important to stress, remained independent throughout, self-releasing her records through her Age 101 imprint.) Or maybe it\u2019s because Little Simz\u2019s sound hasn\u2019t hit the right note yet. There is a lot to be said about the fight to occupy a space when your male peers are taking up all the room, especially in the bloke-heavy world of rap. Women, for the most part, have had to create new paths while their male counterparts get given a free pass down the established ones \u2013 even more so, it seems, when your image is not overtly sexualised. Simz\u2019s approach has been to explore the areas in-between \u2013 mixing up genres, being more experimental than her peers \u2013 but it has sometimes been to uncertain effect. At first, her music was lumped in with grime, but in fact it cast around for other sounds: dubstep, jazz, down-tempo hip-hop, neo-soul. Reviews, including my own in 2015, suggested that while she had undeniable technical flair, Simz still had to \u201cfind her voice\u201d. By which they meant, partly, that she didn\u2019t quite fit in with whatever was currently going on in music. Maybe Simz didn\u2019t break through because female MCs used to be a hard sell. Maybe it\u2019s because she wasn\u2019t grime enough for grime fans but too grime for, say, 6 Music listeners (the type that like Young Fathers). But while her last album, brave and huge in scope, was certainly incomparable to anything else at the time, it\u2019s also possible that she just needed some bigger tunes. On Grey Area, those are in abundance. It swings. It grooves. It\u2019s not bogged down by a self-consciously poetic concept. And it feels like a record rather than a showcase, anchored by the production work of Simz\u2019s childhood friend Inflo. He is the Timbaland to her Missy, and gives her songs the glue they needed. Born Alex Baranowski, the producer and film composer seems to have taken notes while working with Danger Mouse on Michael Kiwanuka\u2019s 2016 album, Love &amp; Hate (in an industry game of tag, Kiwanuka appears on Grey Area\u2019s final track, Flowers). There are big, chunky breaks, fat funk dollops, the crackle of US soul, touches of cosmic jazz and cinematic strings \u2013 also reminiscent of Adrian Younge\u2019s work with Ghostface Killah. The lead tune, 101 FM, features the best instrumental since Stormzy\u2019s Shut Up. Simz, meanwhile, has unlocked a new level of versatility. Her tracks were always soberingly serious, but here there is humour, and songs that border on the feelgood. Offence is Simz at her most Missy, deadpanning playfully bravado lines such as \u201cI\u2019m Jay-Z on a bad day, Shakespeare on my worst days\u201d over a deliciously grainy Quincy bassline. On Boss, she hollers through a megaphone like a whooping bluesman as she takes out the men who distract her. Simz has said in interviews that she dislikes being referred to as a \u201cfemale MC\u201d, but gender inequality has proved a fertile ground: on Venom, she spits \u201cthey don\u2019t wanna address that I\u2019m the best here for the mere fact that I\u2019ve got ovaries\u201d over taut, horror-score strings. Men, she continues, never give women credit because they \u201cdon\u2019t like pussy in power\u201d. She is not quite the voice of a generation \u2013 her tracks are too inward-looking for that \u2013 but she could be, given time. On Wounds, with a pleasing croon from Jamaica\u2019s Chronixx on the chorus, her bars survey gang crime and gun violence with a detached brilliance. Simz has said that making Grey Area was \u201clike therapy\u201d, after a dark spell where she questioned the isolation of trying to, as the cliche goes, make her own way. Smidgens of her struggle with alienation and questioning her career path pepper her tracks \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m so selfish,\u201d goes Cleo Sol\u2019s sweetly sung chorus on Selfish, while Flowers looks at the \u201c27 club\u201d of dead stars and wonders what the real price of fame is. Mega-stardom might never be hers in the end, but Grey Area sets out a different kind of stall anyway: Little Simz is a slow-burner, and now that she\u2019s found a slicker sound, there\u2019s no telling where she might go.",

      "body": "<p>It is just about 30 years since Richard Billingham picked up a camera and focused it on his alcoholic father, Ray, and his violent mother, Liz, and the Black Country council flat in which they lived. The pictures were intended as studies for paintings, but they took on a life of their own. A tutor on Billingham\u2019s art degree course at Sunderland University came across the photographs in a plastic bag and Billingham ended up displaying them in all their flash-lit squalor: toothless and shirtless Ray cradling pop bottles of home brew; Liz, with her lavishly tattooed slabs of arms and vast floral print frocks, lost in her jigsaw puzzles or TV dinners. Taken together \u2013 \u201cRay\u2019s a Laugh\u201d is what Billingham called them \u2013 they seemed to provide a tragicomic through-the-keyhole of degraded post-Thatcherite Britain. Charles Saatchi included Billingham\u2019s work in his 1997 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/aug/30/charles-saatchi-best-of-british\" title=\"\">Sensation</a> show, alongside Damien Hirst\u2019s shark and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/24/tracey-emin-tent-chapman-brothers-hastings\" title=\"\">Tracey Emin\u2019s tent</a>.</p> <p>Up until their premature deaths about a decade later, Billingham\u2019s parents were mostly oblivious to the fact that they had generated a <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/turner-prize-2001/turner-prize-2001-artists-richard-billingham\" title=\"\">Turner prize nomination</a> and global gallery fame. Billingham, however, who made his reputation as an art photographer on the rawness of those pictures, still felt he had unfinished business with them and with his adolescence. The result of that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/17/ray-liz-review-brutal-study-of-a-family-coming-to-pieces\" title=\"\"><em>Ray &amp; Liz</em></a>, a feature film he has written and directed that breathes claustrophobic life back into the original stills. In advance of release, it was shortlisted as an outstanding debut by Bafta and won the same category at the <a href=\"https://www.bifa.film/film/ray-liz/\" title=\"\">British independent film awards</a>.</p> <p>When he was setting out on the journey to make the film nearly three years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/13/richard-billingham-tower-block-white-dee-rays-a-laugh-liz\" title=\"\">I spent a day with Billingham</a> in the streets around Cradley Heath, west of Birmingham, where he grew up. We went up to the 14th floor of the refurbished former council block where the film was partly shot, with its carefully reconstructed 1970s peeling wallpaper and cigarette fug. At the time Billingham, along with his indefatigable producer Jacqui Davies, was launching a Kickstarter campaign to try to get the film off the ground.

That is how it has turned out. In the first part of the film we watch the older Ray (played by Patrick Romer) around the time Billingham made his photos, trapped in his bedroom, uncertain whether it is day or night, taking delivery of his plastic bottles of booze from a friend and slowly draining them, shouting out to the estranged Liz through the flat window.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9kSbxwIiUg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u9kSbxwIiUg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9kSbxwIiUg\">Watch a trailer for Ray &amp; Liz.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The second part of the movie shifts back to when Billingham was about 10 and the family\u2019s problems first spiralled after Ray lost his job as a factory machinist, and was conned out of his few grand of redundancy money. That memory involves an incident with Billingham\u2019s childlike Uncle Lol, who is left in charge of Richard\u2019s baby brother Jason, events that reveal Liz (played brilliantly as a younger woman by Ella Smith) in all her destructive rage.</p> <p>The third part of the film focuses on the days before Jason, then seven or eight, was taken into foster care having spent a winter night in a garden shed far from home without Ray or Liz even noticing he was missing. Those shorthand descriptions are about all the action in Billingham\u2019s film, but they do not begin to explain the layers of complex neglect (and frequent brutal human comedy) that are re-examined.</p> <p>Billingham is, in person, both protective of that past and in some ways dismissive of its impacts. He has found ways, if not of processing it, then at least of framing it. He doesn\u2019t blame his parents. Things could have turned out worse. As he said to me last week, looking back on it from his home in Swansea: \u201cJason often says to me now that, statistically, we should either be in prison or dead or homeless.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People on the streets have a social life parallel to ours, but separate. You glimpse how they see us, from low down</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That they aren\u2019t, Billingham puts down to two things: elements of luck, and the fact that both he and his brother had \u201ca love of nature\u201d gleaned from watching David Attenborough documentaries and nurtured by annual childhood visits with Liz to Dudley Zoo, the highlight of his year. These outings, he believes, looking back, gave both him and his brother \u2013 who kept a box of pet snails under his bed \u2013 a way of seeing; a sense that the alcoholic chaos of family, caged and confined in its four walls, was not all the world.</p> <p>In some ways, I suggested to Billingham, the finished film shifts the emotional heart of his pictures away from Ray and Liz and on to Jason, who experienced the worst fallout of their dereliction. Billingham depicts himself as numbed and helpless in protecting his brother. He smiles at my suggestion that the film is a fraternal love letter, but concedes that certainly those were the hardest parts for him to reimagine. Was a misplaced guilt at not having done more for his brother one of the motivations for needing to explain that past to himself again?</p> <p>\u201cWell, I had to look after myself, I suppose,\u201d he says, after a pause. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the parents\u2019 job, isn\u2019t it, to look after the little one?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d8d774aff49db760c6967b64183592c4e5c8804\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d8d774aff49db760c6967b64183592c4e5c8804/0_0_1950_1263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From the series Ray\u2019s A Laugh by Richard Billingham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From the series Ray\u2019s A Laugh by Richard Billingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Billingham/Anthony Reynolds Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He carefully reconstructed some of his brother\u2019s memories \u2013 \u201chow did that smell?\u201d, \u201cwhat did that look like to you?\u201d \u2013 from a series of conversations with him.

      "bodyText": "It is just about 30 years since Richard Billingham picked up a camera and focused it on his alcoholic father, Ray, and his violent mother, Liz, and the Black Country council flat in which they lived. The pictures were intended as studies for paintings, but they took on a life of their own. A tutor on Billingham\u2019s art degree course at Sunderland University came across the photographs in a plastic bag and Billingham ended up displaying them in all their flash-lit squalor: toothless and shirtless Ray cradling pop bottles of home brew; Liz, with her lavishly tattooed slabs of arms and vast floral print frocks, lost in her jigsaw puzzles or TV dinners. Taken together \u2013 \u201cRay\u2019s a Laugh\u201d is what Billingham called them \u2013 they seemed to provide a tragicomic through-the-keyhole of degraded post-Thatcherite Britain. Charles Saatchi included Billingham\u2019s work in his 1997 Sensation show, alongside Damien Hirst\u2019s shark and Tracey Emin\u2019s tent. Up until their premature deaths about a decade later, Billingham\u2019s parents were mostly oblivious to the fact that they had generated a Turner prize nomination and global gallery fame. Billingham, however, who made his reputation as an art photographer on the rawness of those pictures, still felt he had unfinished business with them and with his adolescence. The result of that is Ray &amp; Liz, a feature film he has written and directed that breathes claustrophobic life back into the original stills. In advance of release, it was shortlisted as an outstanding debut by Bafta and won the same category at the British independent film awards. When he was setting out on the journey to make the film nearly three years ago, I spent a day with Billingham in the streets around Cradley Heath, west of Birmingham, where he grew up. We went up to the 14th floor of the refurbished former council block where the film was partly shot, with its carefully reconstructed 1970s peeling wallpaper and cigarette fug. At the time Billingham, along with his indefatigable producer Jacqui Davies, was launching a Kickstarter campaign to try to get the film off the ground. In the event, that campaign raised around \u00a320,000 \u2013 plus a good deal of crucial awareness \u2013 toward a final begged and borrowed budget of \u00a3700,000 or so. Billingham sat back then in a local cafe along with Deidre Kelly (\u201cWhite Dee\u201d of the Channel 4 documentary Benefits Street, who plays the older Liz in the film) and talked, in his halting, introspective way, about how he envisaged the movie as \u201ca triptych\u201d, of three intense fragments of childhood memory. That is how it has turned out. In the first part of the film we watch the older Ray (played by Patrick Romer) around the time Billingham made his photos, trapped in his bedroom, uncertain whether it is day or night, taking delivery of his plastic bottles of booze from a friend and slowly draining them, shouting out to the estranged Liz through the flat window. The second part of the movie shifts back to when Billingham was about 10 and the family\u2019s problems first spiralled after Ray lost his job as a factory machinist, and was conned out of his few grand of redundancy money. That memory involves an incident with Billingham\u2019s childlike Uncle Lol, who is left in charge of Richard\u2019s baby brother Jason, events that reveal Liz (played brilliantly as a younger woman by Ella Smith) in all her destructive rage. The third part of the film focuses on the days before Jason, then seven or eight, was taken into foster care having spent a winter night in a garden shed far from home without Ray or Liz even noticing he was missing. Those shorthand descriptions are about all the action in Billingham\u2019s film, but they do not begin to explain the layers of complex neglect (and frequent brutal human comedy) that are re-examined. Billingham is, in person, both protective of that past and in some ways dismissive of its impacts. He has found ways, if not of processing it, then at least of framing it. He doesn\u2019t blame his parents. Things could have turned out worse. As he said to me last week, looking back on it from his home in Swansea: \u201cJason often says to me now that, statistically, we should either be in prison or dead or homeless.\u201d That they aren\u2019t, Billingham puts down to two things: elements of luck, and the fact that both he and his brother had \u201ca love of nature\u201d gleaned from watching David Attenborough documentaries and nurtured by annual childhood visits with Liz to Dudley Zoo, the highlight of his year.

He mentions other events about that life that would make a film.\u201d But Billingham is not convinced. He\u2019s 48 now, and he believes there are other stories out there to tell. As he begins to describe them, though, I wonder if it is quite so easy to escape from the one that made you a storyteller. Ray &amp; Liz is in cinemas from 8 March",

      "body": "<p>Having learned about film-making by starting as a runner at 17 and working his way up through the industry, <a href=\"https://www.tobymacdonald.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Toby MacDonald</a> cut his teeth with two Bafta-nominated short films, <em>Je t\u2019aime John Wayne</em> (2001) and <em>Heavy Metal Drummer</em> (2005), and directed television and commercials. Now the west Londoner makes his feature debut with <em><a href=\"https://www.oldboysmovie.com/\" title=\"\">Old Boys</a></em>, loosely based on the story of Cyrano de Bergerac. The film stars Alex Lawther (<em>The End of the F***ing World</em>) as Amberson, a student at a satirised version of an English boarding school. He must act as an intermediary between the daughter of the new French master and the handsome dunce who she erroneously believes is a poet.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve travelled around the world with a film </strong><strong>that has an archetypal</strong><strong> British backdrop \u2013 a boys\u2019 boarding school. Has there been a marked difference in the way the film has been received in different countries?</strong><br>It\u2019s interesting to watch it in different places. In China they laughed all the way through. I wonder if <em>Harry Potter</em> has slightly softened people up to the idea of the boarding school. But, predictably, for a film about why Englishmen are so bad with women, France has been the place where they have taken to it the most.</p> <p><strong>With the public school environment and the communication issues between England and France, it feels like a perfect movie to explain Brexit Britain.</strong><br>You\u2019re right. The false confidence those types of boarding schools can instil really seems to be coming to the fore at the moment. The notion of isolating yourself. And I suppose, the fantasy of what war can do for your character, the idea of past glory, it\u2019s all part of it. That\u2019s part of the fabric of those schools, and you can see how it filters into everyday life in disastrous ways.</p> <p><strong>Central to the culture of the fictional school is a game called </strong><strong>streamers, which is played in a stream, with a square ball. Is it a real game?</strong><br>Lots of those schools have their own made-up games, which are often quirks of architecture. And these games start to have a certain value in how you\u2019re perceived at school, in terms of status. Streamers is a composite of <a href=\"https://www.etoncollege.com/wallgame.aspx\" title=\"\">the wall game</a> they play at Eton, in which nobody has scored for something like 100 years. And there\u2019s an extraordinary game called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2016/feb/11/ashbournes-royal-shrovetide-football-match-photo-essay\" title=\"\">Royal Shrovetide football</a>, which is played between two villages in the Midlands by about 200 people across a river with a giant football.</p> <p>There\u2019s a combination of violence and absurdity, the sink-or-swim aspect. We wanted something that could capture the attitude of the school in one place. It\u2019s elaborate and pointless and has a slightly Quentin Blake aspect to it.</p> <p><strong>The period setting \u2013 the 1980s \u2013 is crucial to the atmosphere of the film. Rather than communicate through text messages and gifs, the characters create little hand</strong><strong>made collages and VHS films</strong><strong> and handwritten letters.</strong><br>It was important that we set it then.

      "bodyText": "Having learned about film-making by starting as a runner at 17 and working his way up through the industry, Toby MacDonald cut his teeth with two Bafta-nominated short films, Je t\u2019aime John Wayne (2001) and Heavy Metal Drummer (2005), and directed television and commercials. Now the west Londoner makes his feature debut with Old Boys, loosely based on the story of Cyrano de Bergerac. The film stars Alex Lawther (The End of the F***ing World) as Amberson, a student at a satirised version of an English boarding school. He must act as an intermediary between the daughter of the new French master and the handsome dunce who she erroneously believes is a poet. You\u2019ve travelled around the world with a film that has an archetypal British backdrop \u2013 a boys\u2019 boarding school. Has there been a marked difference in the way the film has been received in different countries? It\u2019s interesting to watch it in different places. In China they laughed all the way through. I wonder if Harry Potter has slightly softened people up to the idea of the boarding school. But, predictably, for a film about why Englishmen are so bad with women, France has been the place where they have taken to it the most. With the public school environment and the communication issues between England and France, it feels like a perfect movie to explain Brexit Britain. You\u2019re right. The false confidence those types of boarding schools can instil really seems to be coming to the fore at the moment. The notion of isolating yourself. And I suppose, the fantasy of what war can do for your character, the idea of past glory, it\u2019s all part of it. That\u2019s part of the fabric of those schools, and you can see how it filters into everyday life in disastrous ways. Central to the culture of the fictional school is a game called streamers, which is played in a stream, with a square ball. Is it a real game? Lots of those schools have their own made-up games, which are often quirks of architecture. And these games start to have a certain value in how you\u2019re perceived at school, in terms of status. Streamers is a composite of the wall game they play at Eton, in which nobody has scored for something like 100 years. And there\u2019s an extraordinary game called Royal Shrovetide football, which is played between two villages in the Midlands by about 200 people across a river with a giant football. There\u2019s a combination of violence and absurdity, the sink-or-swim aspect. We wanted something that could capture the attitude of the school in one place. It\u2019s elaborate and pointless and has a slightly Quentin Blake aspect to it. The period setting \u2013 the 1980s \u2013 is crucial to the atmosphere of the film. Rather than communicate through text messages and gifs, the characters create little handmade collages and VHS films and handwritten letters. It was important that we set it then. That allowed us to visit the school at the peak of its confidence, unaware that it\u2019s about to have to change. Then, for the Cyrano story, we really wanted the lo-fi creativity to be a wonderful part of the messages between them. We wanted to show Amberson\u2019s creativity and imagination. And we wanted to do that through the creativity of letter writing, which is a lost joy. Have we actually lost the skill of writing letters, or is it something like vinyl, which will be rediscovered and reclaimed by another generation? I know that it\u2019s a pleasure to handwrite a letter and to receive one \u2013 handwriting is so personal. We felt that was something we could capture \u2013 the joy of making something real. You cast the relatively unknown Alex Lawther in the central role, and then his star rose quite dramatically after Channel 4\u2019s The End of the F***ing World. What effect has that had on the way the film has been received? Alex is so brilliant. There\u2019s a strength to him along with the vulnerability. He\u2019s a new kind of leading man, and I suppose that\u2019s been an interesting thing in terms of the teenage audience that has come to the film.

After three years as Italy\u2019s head coach, he still has to taste victory in the Six Nations and it is set to be unlucky 13 for the former Ireland full-back when his countrymen visit Rome on Sunday. Since losing in the Italian capital six years ago, Ireland have taken it out on the Azzurri. The average score in the past three meetings between the sides is 59-11 in favour of the Six Nations champions, who go into the game knowing that only a bonus-point victory, and a substantial contribution to their points difference, will keep them in contention for the title, regardless of the outcome in Cardiff the day before. Italy are without their captain, Sergio Parisse, who is suffering from concussion. The hooker, Leonardo Ghiraldini, will lead the side and is the one survivor from the team that started the 22-15 victory over Ireland in 2013, their sole success against them in the championship. \u201cIf we work on the things we can control, we will be competitive against Ireland,\u201d said O\u2019Shea, who won two of his 35 caps as a full-back against Italy, one of which ended in defeat in Dublin in 1997, three years before the Azzuri were added to the championship. \u201cOur intensity must be high.

Wales turned up in Rome two weeks ago with a largely reserve side as they tested their resources ahead of the World Cup but Ireland have chosen their strongest available back division while resting three of their front-five forwards. Johnny Sexton will make his first appearance in Rome since 2011, when a late drop-goal by his replacement that day, Ronan O\u2019Gara, gave Ireland a 13-11 victory. Sexton\u2019s deputy, Joey Carbery, suffered a hamstring strain in training on Wednesday during a session when the full-back, Jordan Larmour, and the No 8, Jack Conan, sustained injuries that put them out of contention. \u201cWe would have started Johnny anyway as he needs game time,\u201d said the Ireland head coach, Joe Schmidt.

I thought there was nothing there. Or only bad things. But I was wrong, that wasn\u2019t true.</p> <p>Ossett was the centre of my world, the home I always went back to: after the football in Huddersfield, the cinema in Dewsbury, gigs in Wakefield or exhibitions in Leeds, it was always back to my bedroom in Ossett. This was the place where I first began to write stories. Because of the comics in the paper shop, the books in the local library and the house, and because nearby, on the same street as my grandmother, lived Stan Barstow, the novelist. I never met or even saw him, but his books and his proximity were an inspiration; writing didn\u2019t seem such an unusual thing to do in Ossett. Still, that didn\u2019t stop me having my head turned by the likes of Samuel Beckett and Nick Cave, dreaming of Paris, Berlin and exile.</p> <p>So as soon as I could, I upped sticks for the bright lights of Wakefield, all of three miles away. The night before I left, I went for a farewell drink in the Red Lion on Dewsbury Road. An old bloke at the bar warned me of \u201cthose Wakefield folk with their Wakefield ways\u201d, then he gripped my arm and said, \u201cnever forget where you\u2019re from, lad. You\u2019re from Ossett, remember that.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 David Peace\u2019s </em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/patient-x-9780571333646.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Patient X </em></a><em>is published in paperback by Faber. </em></p>",

I couldn\u2019t wait to leave; first to Wakefield, then to Manchester, next to Istanbul, and finally to Tokyo. But I think I would have gone anywhere, just to get away from Ossett. I thought there was nothing there. Or only bad things. But I was wrong, that wasn\u2019t true. Ossett was the centre of my world, the home I always went back to: after the football in Huddersfield, the cinema in Dewsbury, gigs in Wakefield or exhibitions in Leeds, it was always back to my bedroom in Ossett. This was the place where I first began to write stories. Because of the comics in the paper shop, the books in the local library and the house, and because nearby, on the same street as my grandmother, lived Stan Barstow, the novelist. I never met or even saw him, but his books and his proximity were an inspiration; writing didn\u2019t seem such an unusual thing to do in Ossett. Still, that didn\u2019t stop me having my head turned by the likes of Samuel Beckett and Nick Cave, dreaming of Paris, Berlin and exile. So as soon as I could, I upped sticks for the bright lights of Wakefield, all of three miles away. The night before I left, I went for a farewell drink in the Red Lion on Dewsbury Road. An old bloke at the bar warned me of \u201cthose Wakefield folk with their Wakefield ways\u201d, then he gripped my arm and said, \u201cnever forget where you\u2019re from, lad. You\u2019re from Ossett, remember that.\u201d \u2022 David Peace\u2019s Patient X is published in paperback by Faber.",

Later in the clip, Feinstein tells a young activist, \u201cWell, you know better than I do. So I think one day you should run for the United States Senate and then you do it your way.\u201d \u201cGreat, I will,\u201d the teenager responded. The senator issued a statement Friday evening: \u201cI want the children to know they were heard loud and clear,\u201d she said, misstating the group\u2019s name as the Sunshine Movement. \u201cI have been and remain committed to doing everything I can to enact real, meaningful climate change legislation.\u201d The senator reacted \u201cwith smugness + disrespect\u201d, the Sunrise Movement tweeted on Friday, sharing a video clip of the meeting. \u201cHer reaction is why young people desperately want new leadership in Congress.\u201d By Friday night, the video the Sunrise Movement shared on Twitter, which had been edited and focused on clips of the most tense moments from the meeting, had been viewed more than 3m times. The full video of the meeting between Feinstein and the young activists was also available on the group\u2019s Facebook page. Some viewers said they found the full video, which includes more conciliatory moments between Feinstein and the young protesters, less shocking than the edited version. In the full video, Feinstein repeatedly urges the young activist to read her draft legislation and explains the reasons she cannot support the Green New Deal. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to pay for it,\u201d she tells the children. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a single Republican vote, and the Republicans control the US Senate,\u201d she adds. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the Senate for over a quarter of a century, and I know what can pass and I know what can\u2019t pass.\u201d The Green New Deal, a proposal that aims to fight inequality and tackle climate change at the same time, is being advanced by the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, among other Democratic lawmakers. The proposal could face a vote in the senate as early as next week.",

They played some nice football in parts, but lacked the nous to break down a resolute Victory defence and a cutting edge to find the back of the net. When they did find a way past Thomas in goal, on two occasions, they were denied by the woodwork. It wasn\u2019t to be their night. Warren Joyce may well be trying to shut out the noise over his job, but it will get even louder after this result. For Victory, you have to give them credit for fighting back after Neidermeier\u2019s moment of madness, but a point surely isn\u2019t enough for them to sustain a challenge for the premiers\u2019 plate. Indeed, the big winners tonight are Perth Glory, who now seem a sure-fire bet to finish top. </p> <p>That\u2019s all from me. Let\u2019s file that one away under \u201cforgettable derbies\u201d.

Tonight, things get rather more serious with the circus of AFLX packed up for another year. Bragging rights and three A-League points are up for grabs in Docklands (side note: will be interesting to see how the pitch pulls up), but perhaps most crucially, the third Melbourne derby of the season could well make or break City coach Warren Joyce, upon whose shoulders the pressure has been gradually mounting in recent weeks.</p> <p>Just one win in his last seven outings have shone the spotlight on the coach\u2019s contract, which expires at the end of this campaign and is yet to be renewed. Not that Joyce himself is concerned. \u201cThere\u2019s no more pressure than the first day I arrived in the room; the pressure\u2019s on yourself to win games and win the league,\u201d he said during the week. Yep, that seems to have been the problem, Warren. A first defeat to their local rivals after a win and a draw in the two games between this pair so far this season, coupled with a poor performance, may see City\u2019s top brass really consider their options.</p> <p>Victory, in contrast, enter the game in buoyant mood. Kevin Muscat\u2019s side sit in second and welcome marquee man Keisuke Honda back into the starting lineup for the first time in two months. An added bonus comes with the return to the bench of Ola Toivonen after three weeks out. </p> <p>An intriguing evening of football awaits. Please do get in touch on email (mike.hytner@theguardian.com) or on Twitter (@mike_hytner) with any thoughts on tonight\u2019s game. Back shortly with the confirmed teams.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Maclaren is right it\u2019s a point gained, but it\u2019s also two lost given the amount of time City had an extra man. They played some nice football in parts, but lacked the nous to break down a resolute Victory defence and a cutting edge to find the back of the net. When they did find a way past Thomas in goal, on two occasions, they were denied by the woodwork. It wasn\u2019t to be their night. Warren Joyce may well be trying to shut out the noise over his job, but it will get even louder after this result. For Victory, you have to give them credit for fighting back after Neidermeier\u2019s moment of madness, but a point surely isn\u2019t enough for them to sustain a challenge for the premiers\u2019 plate. Indeed, the big winners tonight are Perth Glory, who now seem a sure-fire bet to finish top. That\u2019s all from me. Let\u2019s file that one away under \u201cforgettable derbies\u201d. Until next time. Warren Joyce: \u201cWe\u2019ve come here wanting to win the game. The only pressure on me is the pressure you put on yourself. [The sending off] disrupted our play and press. [Barbarouses\u2019 goal] is not really a shot. I just think he\u2019s hit it as hard as he can.\u201d Thomas Deng: \u201cWe\u2019re pretty satisfied. We started well. Georg [Niedermeier] was a big loss for us. But the boys dug deep. We needed to move on [from the sending off] and that\u2019s what we did. We were pretty comfortable and didn\u2019t feel stretched by them.\u201d Jamie Maclaren: \u201cOn a personal side you\u2019re happy to put in a goal. It\u2019s disappointing we didn\u2019t create more chances. They only had one shot on goal. But it\u2019s a point gained.\u201d 90+4 mins: And that will be that. It ends all square in a derby to forget, to be honest. Final thoughts to follow. 90+4 mins: This might well be it. Jamieson delivers another City corner, but Antonis is there to head clear. 90+2 mins: For the record, Schenkeveld went into the book a few moments ago, for a needless push. 90 mins: Four minutes of added time to be played. Difficult to see City getting a late winner at this stage (commentator\u2019s curse not withstanding). 89 mins: Thomas is quick off his line here, to punch clear another cross into the Victory box. And then noise levels are raised as Toivonen is encouraged to run onto a long ball forward at the other end. Galekovic ventures outside his box to deal with it though. 87 mins: Jamieson swings over yet another cross, but again there\u2019s no one on the end of it. As Thomas ambles about before taking the goal kick, he\u2019s shown yellow. 86 mins: Deng\u2019s header clear isn\u2019t comprehensive and Jamieson picks up the ball before swinging in a cross that gives Thomas a moment of doubt before it lands behind for a goal kick. 84 mins: Not yet. Griffiths\u2019 header briefly causes consternation before the whistle sounds for a high City boot. The attendance is announced: 32,431. 83 mins: But here\u2019s Vidosic, who wins a corner off Broxham. Is there a late winner in them? 82 mins: Victory have about a minute of possession before City win the ball back and begin to build from the back once again. To their credit, they haven\u2019t stopped playing the ball about or resorted to long ball tactics. Trouble is, that approach hasn\u2019t helped them so far. 80 mins: But moments later Vidosic has the chance to become City\u2019s hero with his first touch as the ball breaks for him but he blazes high over the bar! What an introduction that would have been! 79 mins: But before the corner is taken, Dario Vidosic comes on and Baccus departs. Once the corner is eventually taken, it doesn\u2019t come to anything. 78 mins: It\u2019s gone a bit flat momentarily. But City win a corner and get a chance to put Thomas under some pressure. 76 mins: City are building patiently, but with no end product at the moment. Berenguer is hauled off, and here comes McGree. At the same time, Victory bring off Honda for Storm Roux. Clearly, Honda\u2019s not ready for a full 90 minutes on his return from injury. 75 mins: Jamieson now, with a cross from the other side of the pitch. Same result though \u2013 headed clear. Still City come forward though. 74 mins: Here they go. Wales is released on the right hand side before delivering a super cross into the box. Headed clear this time. 73 mins: Time is running out for City to get their noses in front again. Just over a quarter of an hour remaining. 72 mins: McGree is getting ready to enter the fray. 70 mins: Berenguer picks up a yellow card for... backheeling the ball away. When will they learn? 69 mins: Time for a City change. Off goes Harrison, who\u2019s shown glimpses of talent tonight, but nothing more than that, on comes Wales. 67 mins: Jamieson sees a cross blocked by Broxham as City struggle to unlock the Victory defence. Moments later the ball falls kindly to Griffiths, who attempts a snap shot with little backlift. Wide of the mark. 65 mins: Free-kick to Victory. Honda over it. Toivonen lurking in the box. No. The ref spots an infringement and it\u2019ll be a City free-kick. 64 mins: Brattan plays a lovely ball through for Maclaren to run onto... he gets around his defender but it\u2019s too narrow an angle to really test Thomas, who turns behind for a corner. No, the flag was up anyway. 63 mins: City are looking a great deal more composed in possession now. They\u2019re slowing but surely recovering from the hammer blow of Barbarouses\u2019 goal. 62 mins: Oooh! Brattan off the bar! He crashes a beautiful curler from the edge of the box against the woodwork, with Thomas flailing! So close to a second for City. 59 mins: City are beginning to compose themselves now though, and play the ball around a bit more. Harrison makes the wrong decision though, and the momentum is sucked out of an impressive move when his pass goes out of play. 57 mins: Have City got the gumption to make their extra man count? They haven\u2019t been able to do so thus far. Worrying times for Warren Joyce. 55 mins: Pinball in the Victory box! Berenguer\u2019s ball in causes confusion, it hits Harrison on the face and panic ensues! But the home side survive and we\u2019re still on level terms. 53 mins: Barbarouses\u2019s goal was Victory\u2019s first shot of the night. And even labelling it as a shot might be generous \u2013 it looked like he was trying to find Toivonen in the middle. 52 mins: How City might now be rueing those missed chances in the first half. Victory are in the ascendency now, with the wind in their sails, despite their numerical disadvantage. 51 mins: What on earth did Muscat say at half-time? Replays show that earlier handball shout wouldn\u2019t have been a pen, by the way. It matters not now though. 50 mins: Barbarouses levels things up! Honda plays him in on the Victory right and his cross-shot is diverted into his own goal by Galekovic! Not the best keeping you\u2019ll ever see, but Victory don\u2019t care! They\u2019re right back in this! 49 mins: Big handball shout for Victory! Barbarouses\u2019 attempted cross appears to strike a hand on its way through! No onfield decision, but VAR may have a look at it... 48 mins: And now Baccus and Toivonen get all tangled up before Baccus fouls Honda moments later. Not at all the prettiest start to the second half. 47 mins: Da Laet wastes no time in getting his name taken by the ref. A leading arm in an aerial challenge with Brown brings yellow for the Belgian. 46 mins: Back underway at Marvel Stadium! And that expected change has indeed happened: Ola Toivonen is on, with James Troisi the man to make way. \u201cIt\u2019s a minor shift, obviously,\u201d says Muscat. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be really organised. We\u2019re confident we\u2019ll create some chances. Now it\u2019s about trading on chances and taking one of them.\u201d Back in a bit for the second half. In the meantime, here\u2019s some good reading from the incomparable David Squires: 45+2 mins: There goes the whistle and a few half-hearted boos ring out. It could have been much worse for Victory though, had Griffiths\u2019 shot found the back of the net instead of thumping the post. 45+1 mins: Griffiths! Oof what a hit! He clatters the ball against the upright from outside the box with Thomas beaten all ends up! 44 mins: Two minutes of stoppage time to be played. City build slowly as they look to find a way through. 43 mins: Looks like Toivonen will come on for the start of the second half, most likely to act as an outlet as Victory hope to hit City on the break. 41 mins: Here\u2019s a flash point as Brattan flies into a challenge on Brown! That\u2019s a nasty one and the two \u201ccome together\u201d. Brattan is booked before Beana comes over shoves the City player to earn himself a yellow. Needless all around, really. 40 mins: The TV microphones are picking up all sorts tonight! More foul-mouthed shouts ring out and let\u2019s just hope the kids are already in bed. 39 mins: Honda curls the free-kick into the City box, but it comes to nothing this time. 38 mins: Ironic cheers ring out as Victory get a free-kick. Referee Peter Green is public enemy No 1 at the moment, perhaps unfairly. 37 mins: Muscat is talking to Toivonen on the Victory bench. Looks like he might be coming on. 36 mins: Antonis lofts a long ball forward to Barbarouses, who for a moment looks like he\u2019ll get a run in on goal, but the flag is up on the far side, and he\u2019s called offside. Replays don\u2019t really back up that decision, hence Barbarouses\u2019 frustration. 34 mins: Here come City again, with Harrison. Lovely skills from the on-loan Tottenham player, who completely does Deng when he comes inside. Deng is thankful to Donachie though, with the sub making a crucial block as Harrison shoots. 32 mins: City start playing the ball about now, using their man advantage to good effect. Harrison looks to run onto a neat flick from Brattan but the ball\u2019s quicker than he is and it runs out of play for a Victory goal kick. 31 mins: For a moment it opens up for Honda as he pulls down a long ball forward. Da Laet sees to it that the Japanese player goes no further. He brings him down, and gets away without a booking, much to the chagrin of the home crowd. 30 mins: Berengeur\u2019s corner is deep, too deep to cause any major concern for the Victory defence. Half an hour gone, and City are well on top now, following Neidermeier\u2019s moment of madness earlier. 29 mins: Donachie now struggles under pressure and concedes the free-kick. No yellow? Surprising. City win a corner from the free-kick. 28 mins: Ooh! Maclaren sees Thomas off his line and tries his luck from 40 yards out! He hasn\u2019t got his radar tuned though and his sliced effort flies well wide of the mark. 26 mins: This is going to be a real test of City\u2019s character now, just as much as Victory\u2019s. You\u2019d expect them to put the game beyond Victory\u2019s reach before it gets to squeaky bum time later on. Whether they\u2019ve got the wherewithal to do so is another story. 25 mins: City win a corner off Brown which Berenguer takes. De Laet goes for it but it\u2019s headed clear by the Victory defence. 22 mins: Harrison links up with Baccus who fires on goal from the edge of the box! But his side-footer is off target and the ball flies well wide of the frame of Thomas\u2019s goal. 21 mins: Honda now goes into the book, albeit for what looks like a soft one on Berenguer. The Victory fans don\u2019t like that one bit and we\u2019ve got an atmosphere inside Marvel Stadium now. 19 mins: With so long to go this match, you fear for 10-man Victory. But this is a derby, and as we\u2019re constantly told, you can\u2019t take anything for granted in a derby... 17 mins: Well, well, well. A nightmare for Victory, but could this prove to be Warren Joyce\u2019s saviour? Victory are forced into a change, bringing off the unfortunate Kamsoba and bringing on Donachie. 16 mins: Maclaren makes no mistake from the spot to notch his third in three game since signing with City! What a stroke of fortune for City! And what a calamity for Victory! 15 mins: Here we go! The derby erupts into life as Niedermeier loses his bearings completely! Maclaren capitalises to race onto the goal and bear down on goal. Niedermeier is all over him and Maclaren tumbles! Penalty to City and a red card for the German! 14 mins: Good is under pressure from Troisi here, but the City defender does, um, good to get himself out of trouble. 12 mins: Not much of real note to report so far. Niedermeier does his best to ignite things with a sliding challenge on Maclaren which is deemed late by the referee \u2013 and worthy of the game\u2019s first yellow card. 10 mins: Victory enjoy a nice but brief bit of short passing on the near touchline but the move is eventually broken up by City. 9 mins: Jamieson overcooks a cross into the Victory box now, and the home side will look to play the ball out of the back. 7 mins: Honda looks to slip it through to but no dice this time. Each team just feeling the other out at the moment as the game begins to settle into a rhythm. 6 mins: A good header from Deng repels Brattan\u2019s dangerous cross into the middle and Victory look pretty solid at the back so far. 5 mins: CONFIRMED: It was Bozza with the expletive earlier. 4 mins: Victory play it neatly out from the back but when the ball is played upfield, Barbarouses falls over and City are able to claim possession. The Kiwi looks pleadingly at the ref but there\u2019s nothing doing. 3 mins: Deng clips it forward to Honda, who mis-controls, uncharacteristically. A bit of ping pong ensues before Victory get the ball down and look to build from the back. 2 mins: De Laet makes a dart down the right hand side but he\u2019s challenged and the ball deflects back off his boot and balloons downfield to Thomas in the Victory goal. 1 min: OK, here we go then! The referee\u2019s whistle toots and the first half is underway at Marvel Stadium! Here come the teams, to the strains of Stand By Me and a sea of Victory scarves. Kick-off was supposed to be at 7:50pm, by the way. Just earlier, we had a slight, um, mishap on Fox Sports. Unfortunate. Just before we get underway at Marvel Stadium, there\u2019s just about time to have a read of Luke Henriques-Gomes\u2019 dispatch from a rather important event at Pascoe Vale last night. It hardly mattered that Hakeem al-Araibi didn\u2019t make it on to the pitch for his homecoming match. The Bahraini refugee, whose recent imprisonment in Thailand shone an uncomfortable spotlight on the intersection between human rights, diplomacy and sport, was always going to be the focus of Pascoe Vale\u2019s first home game of the season. Here\u2019s Warren Joyce, asked if the speculation over his future this week has had any impact on him: \u201cNo, you\u2019ve got your own standards. I\u2019ve got my things I wanted to do when I came to this country.\u201d Here\u2019s AAP\u2019s Ben McKay with the latest on the pitch, post last night\u2019s AFLX. Spoiler: it\u2019s not great. The full-time whistle has just gone in tonight\u2019s other game: an Adam Le Fondre penalty midway through the second half was enough for Sydney to pick up all three points away at Phoenix \u2013 in Campbelltown. Lacking the usual perks of playing at home (even though the fixtures list stated this was a Phoenix home game), Wellington were unable to break down Sydney, who leapfrogged Victory into second with the win. How will Victory respond? It\u2019s been a week of intense work on the training ground for both teams in preparation for tonight\u2019s big game. And mucking about in dodgem cars for some Victory players. Here\u2019s confirmation of Honda\u2019s eagerly-anticipated return. Terry Antonis also returns from suspension, with Kenny Athiu dropping to the bench. And for City, hamstrung Harrison Delbridge misses out and Rostyn Griffiths comes into midfield. Dario Vidosic and Iacopo La Rocca return to the bench. Twenty-four hours ago at Marvel Stadium, it was all painted faces, \u201cbanter\u201d and schoolyard games. Tonight, things get rather more serious with the circus of AFLX packed up for another year. Bragging rights and three A-League points are up for grabs in Docklands (side note: will be interesting to see how the pitch pulls up), but perhaps most crucially, the third Melbourne derby of the season could well make or break City coach Warren Joyce, upon whose shoulders the pressure has been gradually mounting in recent weeks. Just one win in his last seven outings have shone the spotlight on the coach\u2019s contract, which expires at the end of this campaign and is yet to be renewed. Not that Joyce himself is concerned. \u201cThere\u2019s no more pressure than the first day I arrived in the room; the pressure\u2019s on yourself to win games and win the league,\u201d he said during the week. Yep, that seems to have been the problem, Warren. A first defeat to their local rivals after a win and a draw in the two games between this pair so far this season, coupled with a poor performance, may see City\u2019s top brass really consider their options. Victory, in contrast, enter the game in buoyant mood. Kevin Muscat\u2019s side sit in second and welcome marquee man Keisuke Honda back into the starting lineup for the first time in two months. An added bonus comes with the return to the bench of Ola Toivonen after three weeks out. An intriguing evening of football awaits. Please do get in touch on email (mike.hytner@theguardian.com) or on Twitter (@mike_hytner) with any thoughts on tonight\u2019s game. Back shortly with the confirmed teams.",

      "body": "<p>The frozen white expanse of Lake Inari stretches off towards banks of dark birch and pine trees marking the distant shore line. There is not even the faintest breeze \u2013 the sub-zero air is perfectly still and very, very cold. A delicate dusting of snowflakes has fallen in the night, a pristine layer of gleaming crystals resting on the thick sheet of snow and ice.</p> <p>Jussa Seuruj\u00e4rvi, 22, momentarily stops helping his father, 51, and sister, 16, pull up fishing nets from holes in the ice to take in the long, slow Arctic sunrise, which glows with pastel strokes of yellows, purples and pinks. His brow furrows slightly and he says with a gentle determination: \u201cI want to continue living from this land just as my ancestors have done for hundreds and hundreds of years. This is a way of life for us \u2013 it is not just a job.\u201d</p> <p>His father quickly dispatches five prized white fish and a slimy looking burbot ensnared in the net. Almost every part will be used by the family, with even the burbot\u2019s muddy-green scales destined for his mother\u2019s handicrafts. \u201cThe Sami way has always been that you take what you need \u2013 you don\u2019t take any more,\u201d says Seuruj\u00e4rvi.</p> <p>This is the sacred heart of the Sami homeland in the upper reaches of Finnish Lapland. It is a largely pristine landscape of forests, marshes, scree-covered fells and deep, clean lakes. Often described as Europe\u2019s last great wilderness, it is also home to lynxes, brown bears, wolverines and golden eagles. Thousands of tourists come every year to enjoy the unspoiled nature and marvel at wonders such as the northern lights; more than <a href=\"http://www.visitrovaniemi.fi/wp-content/uploads/Rovaniemi-tourism-statistics_December2017.pdf\" title=\"\">100,000 foreign visitors</a>, including 22,000 British tourists, passed through the region\u2019s capital, Rovaniemi, in December 2017.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are thought to be about 1,000 Sami words devoted to reindeer appearance, behaviour and habits</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet climate scientists and locals warn the region is under threat like never before from powerful global political and economic forces keen to exploit its plentiful natural resources and open up lucrative Arctic shipping routes to Asia. The Sami \u2013 who have inhabited these harsh northern latitudes since the last ice age and are the only indigenous people in the EU \u2013 fear that proposals to build a \u20ac2.9bn railway to the EU\u2019s first Arctic port, in Norway, will provide mining and logging companies with the infrastructure they need to venture ever further into the wilder, untouched parts of Lapland.</p> <p>The three municipalities of northern Lapland <a href=\"https://arcticcorridor.fi/\" title=\"\">promote the project</a> to global investors as a way of developing the region\u2019s ore fields and timber industry, as well as exploiting oil and gas reserves in the Barents Sea, which contain 5\u201113% of the world\u2019s untapped oil and 20-30% of the world\u2019s untapped gas. They claim it could one day carry millions of tonnes of goods to Europe from container ships taking advantage of melting sea ice in the Northeast Passage.</p> <p>Although government officials working on the proposed route have this month raised concerns about the scheme\u2019s finances, Finland\u2019s transport minister, Anne Berner, insists it remains a strategic goal for the Nordic country. \u201cMost railway projects are not financially valid or solid in their initial plans. The Arctic rail is still a part of the strategic long-term plan of connecting Finland to other parts of the world, including central Europe,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b6194f45b977a296a8522159f4ab5c04abcf910\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b6194f45b977a296a8522159f4ab5c04abcf910/0_107_7086_4252/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The catch by the ice hole.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The catch by the ice hole.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Redman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the sun begins its descent below the tree line at 3pm, Seuruj\u00e4rvi takes grass on his ski-mobile to feed 25 or so local reindeer he has gathered in the snow-draped forests near his home. \u201cWhen we have enough reindeer, we will have a round-up and other herders will come and take theirs and we will keep ours,\u201d he explains, pointing out the different markings on their backs.</p> <p>Reindeer are revered in Sami culture because for thousands of years these perfectly adapted Arctic survivors have provided families with meat and milk; hides for clothing, shoes and tents; bones and antlers for tools, handicrafts and weapons; and sinews for sewing. This is reflected in the language: there are thought to be about 1,000 Sami words devoted to reindeer appearance, behaviour and habits. Or as Seuruj\u00e4rvi puts it: \u201cWithout the reindeer, the Sami people wouldn\u2019t be.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the government\u2019s preferred route for the railway \u2013 which was formally announced in March last year \u2013 would pass between 5km and 10km from Seuruj\u00e4rvi\u2019s home, cutting in two the land used by his herd and six others in the reindeer cooperative on the north side of Lake Inari. Seuruj\u00e4rvi fears this would spell the end for the reindeer herding practised by the Sami, in which the semi-domesticated animals are allowed to graze freely, consuming more than 400 different types of plants. \u201cEverybody would lose their jobs if the railway comes. Our land would be divided \u2013 it would be like a new border,\u201d he says. \u201cReindeer follow migration paths through forests. If they can\u2019t, there will not be enough food to feed them all.\u201d</p> <p>If the railway is unfenced, accidents with trains speeding at up to 220km/h could decimate herds, especially when they are drawn into open spaces to escape clouds of mosquitoes that rise from marshes in the summer months.</p> <p>Seuruj\u00e4rvi first heard about the plans on social media last year. \u201cI saw it on Facebook \u2013 I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>***</p> <p>It is not just reindeer herders on remote farms who were the last to hear about major infrastructure projects in their homeland. In the icy black of the early evening, Sami parliament president Tiina Sanila-Aikio is heating up reindeer soup in her home on the outskirts of Inari village, which serves as the centre of cultural and political life for the 10,500 registered Sami in Finland. Sanila-Aikio is a former rock musician and language teacher who took on the job when the last president resigned in protest at what he saw as moves by the Finnish state to forcibly assimilate the Sami.</p> <p>She discovered the railway plan while checking her phone in bed in June 2017. \u201cI read it in the media. I didn\u2019t believe it was true. They did not even mention the Sami,\u201d she says between mouthfuls of silky soup, enriched with meaty reindeer bones. The parliament has since been consulted and has made clear its opposition. But the government and municipalities have been developing detailed plans regardless. Sanila-Aikio sees the Finnish authorities\u2019 stance as a continuation of longstanding colonial attitudes towards the Sami, which saw their spiritual beliefs, language and democratic village councils known as Siida suppressed over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. \u201cFirst, they took the religion, then they broke the Siida system, then they took the lands and the language. And now they want to build a railroad,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cd868136ebc8cd3246ea82952031730fd983cd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cd868136ebc8cd3246ea82952031730fd983cd8/0_167_3447_4306/801.jpg\" alt=\"Retired biologist Timo Helle is campaigning against a new mine in an EU-protected nature reserve in Viiankiaapa.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Retired biologist Timo Helle is campaigning against a new mine in an EU-protected nature reserve in Viiankiaapa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Redman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Almost every Sami family can tell you stories of children taken to boarding schools and beaten if they spoke Sami after the second world war. Or relatives from the same generation stripped naked and measured by officials trying to establish their racial inferiority.

At present, only logging and gold panning take place in the Sami homeland. Last year, 4,250 hectares of forest were earmarked for felling and 253 gold extraction permits were in place, including 15 new ones for heavy digging machinery. Sanila-Aikio says this is only the start: \u201cWe don\u2019t have any mines yet. But they are very close \u2013 there are mines all around the Sami area in Finland, Russia, Norway and Sweden.\u201d She calls this process a \u201cslow colonisation\u201d, under which their lands are divided by the railway and handed over to outside industries. \u201cThis means the end of the Sami people, because there are no possibilities to practise traditional livelihoods,\u201d she says, her eyes starting to fill with tears. \u201cThen the Sami are extinct.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1b2170fb417d3d452a1bafbe3ae77bd80432decf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b2170fb417d3d452a1bafbe3ae77bd80432decf/221_589_6839_4104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jussa Seuruj\u00e4rvi ice-fishing with his father, Osmo, and sister, Maiju.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jussa Seuruj\u00e4rvi ice-fishing with his father, Osmo, and sister, Maiju.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Redman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are also fears the project will endanger Lapland\u2019s delicate ecosystems, which are crucial to the fight against runaway climate change. Finnish climate scientist Tero Mustonen \u2013 who has been studying the Arctic region of the Nordic countries for more than 20 years \u2013 says ecologically pristine parts of northern Lapland will be completely transformed by the railway. \u201cThese areas are providing us with climate security. They are the lungs of Europe and the carbon sinks for the future,\u201d he says on the phone from a climate conference. Mustonen, a lead author for the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says Finland must decide if the promised GDP growth is worth the risk: \u201cWhat are the economic benefits of those shipping containers compared to the benefits that rivers and marsh mires have provided to us over millennia in terms of climate security?\u201d The peat-rich soil in Lapland\u2019s wetlands traps vast amounts of carbon, preventing it from contributing to climate change, while rivers act as a conveyor belt, bringing nutrients and carbon between the sea and inland lakes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Finland was last year ranked as the best place to invest by mining companies.

He found engineers would have to quarry for rocks every 4km along the northern stretch of the 465km route to shore up the rails and service road, as well as diverting thousands of brooks, lakes, rivers and streams. \u201cThe railroad itself will be roughly 15m across,\u201d he says. \u201cBut creating a network of service roads and quarries will leave a crater at least 100m wide across an area that has no infrastructure.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d0657738a633f0841bce3199b04638c699f3027\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d0657738a633f0841bce3199b04638c699f3027/0_464_7086_4252/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jussa Seuruj\u00e4rvi feeding reindeer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jussa Seuruj\u00e4rvi feeding reindeer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Redman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though Mustonen cannot predict exactly how much industry will follow, he points out that mining companies are already scouring Lapland for new deposits. \u201cIt is a bonanza. It is California 1848. It is a gold rush,\u201d he says. \u201cWe offer stability and western-style services, in the same sort of poorly regulated legal framework as Congo or Russia. The taxation is minimal and the mining authorities are in favour of giving these lands to these companies.\u201d Finland, which has given over an estimated 13% of its entire land mass to mining activities, was last year <a href=\"https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/annual-survey-of-mining-companies-2017\" title=\"\">ranked as the best place to invest</a> by mining and exploration companies.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Despite these warnings, there appears to be plenty of support for the railway in southern Lapland, perhaps because some locals believe it will bring more industrial jobs to an area that in the past has suffered from high unemployment. The small town of Sodankyl\u00e4, which is on the proposed route, is experiencing a mining boom, with a 6.7% unemployment rate \u2013 the lowest in Lapland.</p> <p>An hour or so outside the town\u2019s busy centre lies the biggest mine in Finland: Kevitsa. This vast open-cast pit \u2013 which is owned by the Swedish mining firm Boliden \u2013 employs 480, mainly local, people, along with 250 contractors. In an almost impenetrable blizzard of snow, giant yellow trucks trundle up and down a spiral of steep dirt roads towards the bottom of the blast-scarred pit 400 metres below ground level. Every year the trucks remove 45m tonnes of waste rock and ore. The extracted copper, nickel and gold is then sold on European metal markets, with some of the rarer metals ending up in China.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1d4cddb9c332785af529bca45abe0077c6897d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1d4cddb9c332785af529bca45abe0077c6897d5/0_25_3447_4306/801.jpg\" alt=\"parliament president Tiina Sanila-Aikio.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This means the end of the Sami people,\u2019 says parliament president Tiina Sanila-Aikio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Redman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a control room overlooking the pit, two workers are taking a break before more rock is blasted away.

There are customers in shops.\u201d Salum\u00e4e, whose husband and brother also work here, says the town was struggling before the mine opened in 2012. \u201cYoungsters were forced to go after they finished school, mostly to southern Finland. Businesses were closing. Without the mine coming, this place would have died,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Digger operator Antti Kunnari, whose two brothers also work at the mine, is supportive of the railway project. \u201cIt would be good.

Europe\u2019s largest gold mine, which is owned by Canadian producer Agnico Eagle, is 85km away in Kittil\u00e4. Anglo American, which has its HQ in London, is currently carrying out exploratory drilling in an EU-protected nature reserve in Viiankiaapa just outside Sodankyl\u00e4.</p> <p>The firm\u2019s Arctic outpost is in an unremarkable building on the edges of Sodankyl\u00e4. The straight-talking Finnish project manager, Jukka Jokela, is enthusiastic about the quality of the metals, including copper, nickel and cobalt, the firm\u2019s drilling rigs have discovered: \u201cThe quality of the deposit is world class. I\u2019ve been in this business for 40 years and I\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d If Anglo-American gets permission from Finnish authorities, it plans to mine underneath the reserve. \u201cMost of the mining will happen at more than 1km depth. We are not going to destroy Viiankiaapa.\u201d</p> <p>Not all the residents are reassured. Riikka Karppinen has been campaigning against the project since she was 15, even meeting ministers in Helsinki. Now in her 20s, she grew up in a village near Viiankiaapa and spent her childhood fishing for pike and picking cloudberries in the reserve. \u201cI have a lot of happy memories,\u201d she says crunching through the snow-caked mire. \u201cI still come here to ski in the winter and in the summer you can hear so many birds.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b65ff31668a3728d00d9b4cd479c881a77126e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b65ff31668a3728d00d9b4cd479c881a77126e1/8_467_3398_4244/801.jpg\" alt=\"Riikka Karppinen\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Riikka Karppinen has been campaigning against the project since she was 15.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Redman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Karppinen, who <a href=\"https://vaalit.yle.fi/results/kv2017/electorate/13/municipality/758\" title=\"\">topped a local election </a>in Sodankyl\u00e4 in 2017, has formed a formidable alliance with Timo Helle, a local retired biologist opposed to the project. They dismiss claims it would leave the habitat unharmed. \u201cThere is no way you can have an environmentally friendly mine in a conservation area \u2013 it would dry out the mire and the infrastructure would change it,\u201d Karppinen says.</p> <p>***</p> <p>More than 100km to the south is the capital of Lapland, Rovaniemi, where thousands of tourists flock to see Santa Claus, drink in ice bars and go on husky sleigh rides. But the region\u2019s politicians have weightier matters on their minds: how to deliver the Arctic railway project over the next 30 years.</p> <p>Mika Riipi, the hard-working county governor of Lapland, has a brief break in his schedule of meetings and trips abroad. He is away so often he doesn\u2019t even have his own room in the regional council\u2019s offices, which overlook the glinting white cityscape of snow-covered housing blocks, theatres and libraries.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This Arctic railway won\u2019t be built if climate change is stopped \u2013 but we might be able to build it when the ice melts</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Riipi, who is in charge of the development of the region, says he has been talking to Chinese state companies keen to invest in the project because Finnish trains could carry goods offloaded in Norway onwards to major European markets. \u201cThey are quite eager to make these kinds of investments,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have this philosophy of the Arctic silk road.\u201d The rest of the \u20ac2.9bn bill could be met by the EU, <a href=\"https://www.lvm.fi/-/study-on-the-arctic-rail-line-completed-kirkenes-routing-to-be-examined-further-968073\" title=\"\">with contributions from the Finnish and Norwegian governments</a>.</p> <p>Riipi believes the project\u2019s success depends on the speed of sea ice melting, as well as geopolitical instability affecting the Suez Canal, which is currently the main shipping route between Asia and Europe. \u201cThis might sound a little controversial, but we have tried to find out those mega trends and then try to think, can we utilise them \u2013 of course climate change is one of those,\u201d he says. Indeed, the project is predicated on rising global temperatures. \u201cI personally believe that this Arctic railway won\u2019t be built if climate change is stopped \u2013 but in the worst-case scenario then we might be able to build it when the ice melts.\u201d </p> <p>The regional council does not include any representatives from the Sami parliament, but Riipi insists they do not have anything to fear from the railway. \u201cThe Sami culture has survived even though roads have been there. This is another road \u2013 except it goes a long way in tunnels,\u201d he says. He adds the council opposes mining in the Sami homeland, although he admits it does not issue the mining permits: \u201cWe made a decision at the regional level, we don\u2019t want any mines in the Sami home area.\u201d</p> <p>Across the street from the regional council offices lies Rovaniemi\u2019s modernist city hall. It was designed by celebrated Finnish architect Alvar Aalto as part of a grand plan to rebuild the city around the contours of a reindeer\u2019s antler, after it was destroyed in the second world war. Heikki Autto, the centre-right chair of the council, also supports the plan. In an airy hall outside the main council chamber, he makes the case that it is an environmentally friendly scheme. \u201cWe all want to prevent climate change, but what seems to be inevitable is that the ice is going and this opens up the sea route. It is only one-third the distance of the current route between Europe and Asia and, of course, it is more environmentally sound to use the short cut.\u201d</p> <p>Autto claims the railway would help the Sami in northern Lapland. \u201cI have a Sami background myself, but the Sami-speaking population in our traditional home area has diminished to the point where if we don\u2019t find new opportunities and business activity it will totally disappear,\u201d he says. He sees no reason not to allow mines in the Sami homeland: \u201cWhy not? It has to be discussed with the local community, but it would provide livelihoods for hundreds of people directly and for thousands indirectly.\u201d</p> <p>Back on the darkening shores of Lake Inari, the political machinations of the regional capital seem very far away. Seuruj\u00e4rvi is warming himself up with a cup of coffee and barley bread in his kitchen. He longs to live a quiet life, but believes he must resist the railway if the next generation is to live off the forests and lakes of his ancestors.</p> <p>\u201cReindeer herding has been my only dream,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to give my future children the chance to live in the Sami way.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Commenting on this piece?

      "bodyText": "The frozen white expanse of Lake Inari stretches off towards banks of dark birch and pine trees marking the distant shore line. There is not even the faintest breeze \u2013 the sub-zero air is perfectly still and very, very cold. A delicate dusting of snowflakes has fallen in the night, a pristine layer of gleaming crystals resting on the thick sheet of snow and ice. Jussa Seuruj\u00e4rvi, 22, momentarily stops helping his father, 51, and sister, 16, pull up fishing nets from holes in the ice to take in the long, slow Arctic sunrise, which glows with pastel strokes of yellows, purples and pinks. His brow furrows slightly and he says with a gentle determination: \u201cI want to continue living from this land just as my ancestors have done for hundreds and hundreds of years. This is a way of life for us \u2013 it is not just a job.\u201d His father quickly dispatches five prized white fish and a slimy looking burbot ensnared in the net. Almost every part will be used by the family, with even the burbot\u2019s muddy-green scales destined for his mother\u2019s handicrafts. \u201cThe Sami way has always been that you take what you need \u2013 you don\u2019t take any more,\u201d says Seuruj\u00e4rvi. This is the sacred heart of the Sami homeland in the upper reaches of Finnish Lapland. It is a largely pristine landscape of forests, marshes, scree-covered fells and deep, clean lakes. Often described as Europe\u2019s last great wilderness, it is also home to lynxes, brown bears, wolverines and golden eagles. Thousands of tourists come every year to enjoy the unspoiled nature and marvel at wonders such as the northern lights; more than 100,000 foreign visitors, including 22,000 British tourists, passed through the region\u2019s capital, Rovaniemi, in December 2017. Yet climate scientists and locals warn the region is under threat like never before from powerful global political and economic forces keen to exploit its plentiful natural resources and open up lucrative Arctic shipping routes to Asia. The Sami \u2013 who have inhabited these harsh northern latitudes since the last ice age and are the only indigenous people in the EU \u2013 fear that proposals to build a \u20ac2.9bn railway to the EU\u2019s first Arctic port, in Norway, will provide mining and logging companies with the infrastructure they need to venture ever further into the wilder, untouched parts of Lapland. The three municipalities of northern Lapland promote the project to global investors as a way of developing the region\u2019s ore fields and timber industry, as well as exploiting oil and gas reserves in the Barents Sea, which contain 5\u201113% of the world\u2019s untapped oil and 20-30% of the world\u2019s untapped gas. They claim it could one day carry millions of tonnes of goods to Europe from container ships taking advantage of melting sea ice in the Northeast Passage. Although government officials working on the proposed route have this month raised concerns about the scheme\u2019s finances, Finland\u2019s transport minister, Anne Berner, insists it remains a strategic goal for the Nordic country. \u201cMost railway projects are not financially valid or solid in their initial plans. The Arctic rail is still a part of the strategic long-term plan of connecting Finland to other parts of the world, including central Europe,\u201d she says. As the sun begins its descent below the tree line at 3pm, Seuruj\u00e4rvi takes grass on his ski-mobile to feed 25 or so local reindeer he has gathered in the snow-draped forests near his home. \u201cWhen we have enough reindeer, we will have a round-up and other herders will come and take theirs and we will keep ours,\u201d he explains, pointing out the different markings on their backs. Reindeer are revered in Sami culture because for thousands of years these perfectly adapted Arctic survivors have provided families with meat and milk; hides for clothing, shoes and tents; bones and antlers for tools, handicrafts and weapons; and sinews for sewing. This is reflected in the language: there are thought to be about 1,000 Sami words devoted to reindeer appearance, behaviour and habits. Or as Seuruj\u00e4rvi puts it: \u201cWithout the reindeer, the Sami people wouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Yet the government\u2019s preferred route for the railway \u2013 which was formally announced in March last year \u2013 would pass between 5km and 10km from Seuruj\u00e4rvi\u2019s home, cutting in two the land used by his herd and six others in the reindeer cooperative on the north side of Lake Inari. Seuruj\u00e4rvi fears this would spell the end for the reindeer herding practised by the Sami, in which the semi-domesticated animals are allowed to graze freely, consuming more than 400 different types of plants. \u201cEverybody would lose their jobs if the railway comes. Our land would be divided \u2013 it would be like a new border,\u201d he says. \u201cReindeer follow migration paths through forests. If they can\u2019t, there will not be enough food to feed them all.\u201d If the railway is unfenced, accidents with trains speeding at up to 220km/h could decimate herds, especially when they are drawn into open spaces to escape clouds of mosquitoes that rise from marshes in the summer months. Seuruj\u00e4rvi first heard about the plans on social media last year. \u201cI saw it on Facebook \u2013 I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he says. *** It is not just reindeer herders on remote farms who were the last to hear about major infrastructure projects in their homeland. In the icy black of the early evening, Sami parliament president Tiina Sanila-Aikio is heating up reindeer soup in her home on the outskirts of Inari village, which serves as the centre of cultural and political life for the 10,500 registered Sami in Finland. Sanila-Aikio is a former rock musician and language teacher who took on the job when the last president resigned in protest at what he saw as moves by the Finnish state to forcibly assimilate the Sami. She discovered the railway plan while checking her phone in bed in June 2017. \u201cI read it in the media. I didn\u2019t believe it was true. They did not even mention the Sami,\u201d she says between mouthfuls of silky soup, enriched with meaty reindeer bones. The parliament has since been consulted and has made clear its opposition. But the government and municipalities have been developing detailed plans regardless. Sanila-Aikio sees the Finnish authorities\u2019 stance as a continuation of longstanding colonial attitudes towards the Sami, which saw their spiritual beliefs, language and democratic village councils known as Siida suppressed over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. \u201cFirst, they took the religion, then they broke the Siida system, then they took the lands and the language. And now they want to build a railroad,\u201d she says. Almost every Sami family can tell you stories of children taken to boarding schools and beaten if they spoke Sami after the second world war. Or relatives from the same generation stripped naked and measured by officials trying to establish their racial inferiority. Although much has changed since those dark days \u2013 the Sami now have an elected parliament, and language and culture rights enshrined in the Finnish constitution \u2013 they do not have ultimate control of their lands and waters. Finland, unlike Norway, has not ratified the UN Independent Labour Organization\u2019s convention of indigenous people, which would give the Sami a greater say over their homeland. Nor has the Finnish state apologised for the treatment of the Sami, which both Norway and Sweden did in the 1990s. Sanila-Aikio says the parliament would not be able to stop corporations using the railway to get even more raw materials out of the Sami homeland. \u201cOur previous president used to say that the only thing we can really decide is the date of our meetings,\u201d she notes, with a sardonic smile. At present, only logging and gold panning take place in the Sami homeland. Last year, 4,250 hectares of forest were earmarked for felling and 253 gold extraction permits were in place, including 15 new ones for heavy digging machinery. Sanila-Aikio says this is only the start: \u201cWe don\u2019t have any mines yet. But they are very close \u2013 there are mines all around the Sami area in Finland, Russia, Norway and Sweden.\u201d She calls this process a \u201cslow colonisation\u201d, under which their lands are divided by the railway and handed over to outside industries. \u201cThis means the end of the Sami people, because there are no possibilities to practise traditional livelihoods,\u201d she says, her eyes starting to fill with tears. \u201cThen the Sami are extinct.\u201d There are also fears the project will endanger Lapland\u2019s delicate ecosystems, which are crucial to the fight against runaway climate change. Finnish climate scientist Tero Mustonen \u2013 who has been studying the Arctic region of the Nordic countries for more than 20 years \u2013 says ecologically pristine parts of northern Lapland will be completely transformed by the railway. \u201cThese areas are providing us with climate security. They are the lungs of Europe and the carbon sinks for the future,\u201d he says on the phone from a climate conference. Mustonen, a lead author for the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says Finland must decide if the promised GDP growth is worth the risk: \u201cWhat are the economic benefits of those shipping containers compared to the benefits that rivers and marsh mires have provided to us over millennia in terms of climate security?\u201d The peat-rich soil in Lapland\u2019s wetlands traps vast amounts of carbon, preventing it from contributing to climate change, while rivers act as a conveyor belt, bringing nutrients and carbon between the sea and inland lakes. Mustonen has produced the only study so far examining the ecological impact of the railway for the Sami parliament. He found engineers would have to quarry for rocks every 4km along the northern stretch of the 465km route to shore up the rails and service road, as well as diverting thousands of brooks, lakes, rivers and streams. \u201cThe railroad itself will be roughly 15m across,\u201d he says. \u201cBut creating a network of service roads and quarries will leave a crater at least 100m wide across an area that has no infrastructure.\u201d Though Mustonen cannot predict exactly how much industry will follow, he points out that mining companies are already scouring Lapland for new deposits. \u201cIt is a bonanza. It is California 1848. It is a gold rush,\u201d he says. \u201cWe offer stability and western-style services, in the same sort of poorly regulated legal framework as Congo or Russia. The taxation is minimal and the mining authorities are in favour of giving these lands to these companies.\u201d Finland, which has given over an estimated 13% of its entire land mass to mining activities, was last year ranked as the best place to invest by mining and exploration companies. *** Despite these warnings, there appears to be plenty of support for the railway in southern Lapland, perhaps because some locals believe it will bring more industrial jobs to an area that in the past has suffered from high unemployment. The small town of Sodankyl\u00e4, which is on the proposed route, is experiencing a mining boom, with a 6.7% unemployment rate \u2013 the lowest in Lapland. An hour or so outside the town\u2019s busy centre lies the biggest mine in Finland: Kevitsa. This vast open-cast pit \u2013 which is owned by the Swedish mining firm Boliden \u2013 employs 480, mainly local, people, along with 250 contractors. In an almost impenetrable blizzard of snow, giant yellow trucks trundle up and down a spiral of steep dirt roads towards the bottom of the blast-scarred pit 400 metres below ground level. Every year the trucks remove 45m tonnes of waste rock and ore. The extracted copper, nickel and gold is then sold on European metal markets, with some of the rarer metals ending up in China. In a control room overlooking the pit, two workers are taking a break before more rock is blasted away. Truck driver Heidi Salum\u00e4e says the mine has been good for the area. \u201cSodankyl\u00e4 is livelier now,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are more people in town. There are customers in shops.\u201d Salum\u00e4e, whose husband and brother also work here, says the town was struggling before the mine opened in 2012. \u201cYoungsters were forced to go after they finished school, mostly to southern Finland. Businesses were closing. Without the mine coming, this place would have died,\u201d she says. Digger operator Antti Kunnari, whose two brothers also work at the mine, is supportive of the railway project. \u201cIt would be good. Kevitsa won\u2019t be the last mine in this area. The railway will help with logistics,\u201d he says. In the bright site office, which looks like an Ikea showroom, Peter Bergman, Kevitsa\u2019s charming Swedish manager, says there are a lot of mining companies prospecting in Lapland. \u201cIt is a big boom. There is a lot of exploration in these northern areas,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are expanding from 7.5m tonnes to 9.5m tonnes of ore a year to meet future demand for electrification and automation.\u201d He denies there is lax regulation, insisting Finland has tightened up its act since the Talvivaara disaster in 2012, when nickel, uranium and other toxins leaked into a nearby lake in the east of the country. \u201cIt has changed the playing field in Finland. There is a lot more control from the authorities,\u201d he says. \u201cThe permit process is really slow. From a find to a mine is about 10 or 15 years.\u201d Alongside the Nordic mining companies, there are Canadian, Australian and British firms rushing to exploit a valuable mineral belt stretching across Lapland. Europe\u2019s largest gold mine, which is owned by Canadian producer Agnico Eagle, is 85km away in Kittil\u00e4. Anglo American, which has its HQ in London, is currently carrying out exploratory drilling in an EU-protected nature reserve in Viiankiaapa just outside Sodankyl\u00e4. The firm\u2019s Arctic outpost is in an unremarkable building on the edges of Sodankyl\u00e4. The straight-talking Finnish project manager, Jukka Jokela, is enthusiastic about the quality of the metals, including copper, nickel and cobalt, the firm\u2019s drilling rigs have discovered: \u201cThe quality of the deposit is world class. I\u2019ve been in this business for 40 years and I\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d If Anglo-American gets permission from Finnish authorities, it plans to mine underneath the reserve. \u201cMost of the mining will happen at more than 1km depth. We are not going to destroy Viiankiaapa.\u201d Not all the residents are reassured. Riikka Karppinen has been campaigning against the project since she was 15, even meeting ministers in Helsinki. Now in her 20s, she grew up in a village near Viiankiaapa and spent her childhood fishing for pike and picking cloudberries in the reserve. \u201cI have a lot of happy memories,\u201d she says crunching through the snow-caked mire. \u201cI still come here to ski in the winter and in the summer you can hear so many birds.\u201d Karppinen, who topped a local election in Sodankyl\u00e4 in 2017, has formed a formidable alliance with Timo Helle, a local retired biologist opposed to the project. They dismiss claims it would leave the habitat unharmed. \u201cThere is no way you can have an environmentally friendly mine in a conservation area \u2013 it would dry out the mire and the infrastructure would change it,\u201d Karppinen says. *** More than 100km to the south is the capital of Lapland, Rovaniemi, where thousands of tourists flock to see Santa Claus, drink in ice bars and go on husky sleigh rides. But the region\u2019s politicians have weightier matters on their minds: how to deliver the Arctic railway project over the next 30 years. Mika Riipi, the hard-working county governor of Lapland, has a brief break in his schedule of meetings and trips abroad. He is away so often he doesn\u2019t even have his own room in the regional council\u2019s offices, which overlook the glinting white cityscape of snow-covered housing blocks, theatres and libraries. Riipi, who is in charge of the development of the region, says he has been talking to Chinese state companies keen to invest in the project because Finnish trains could carry goods offloaded in Norway onwards to major European markets. \u201cThey are quite eager to make these kinds of investments,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have this philosophy of the Arctic silk road.\u201d The rest of the \u20ac2.9bn bill could be met by the EU, with contributions from the Finnish and Norwegian governments. Riipi believes the project\u2019s success depends on the speed of sea ice melting, as well as geopolitical instability affecting the Suez Canal, which is currently the main shipping route between Asia and Europe. \u201cThis might sound a little controversial, but we have tried to find out those mega trends and then try to think, can we utilise them \u2013 of course climate change is one of those,\u201d he says. Indeed, the project is predicated on rising global temperatures. \u201cI personally believe that this Arctic railway won\u2019t be built if climate change is stopped \u2013 but in the worst-case scenario then we might be able to build it when the ice melts.\u201d The regional council does not include any representatives from the Sami parliament, but Riipi insists they do not have anything to fear from the railway. \u201cThe Sami culture has survived even though roads have been there. This is another road \u2013 except it goes a long way in tunnels,\u201d he says. He adds the council opposes mining in the Sami homeland, although he admits it does not issue the mining permits: \u201cWe made a decision at the regional level, we don\u2019t want any mines in the Sami home area.\u201d Across the street from the regional council offices lies Rovaniemi\u2019s modernist city hall. It was designed by celebrated Finnish architect Alvar Aalto as part of a grand plan to rebuild the city around the contours of a reindeer\u2019s antler, after it was destroyed in the second world war. Heikki Autto, the centre-right chair of the council, also supports the plan. In an airy hall outside the main council chamber, he makes the case that it is an environmentally friendly scheme. \u201cWe all want to prevent climate change, but what seems to be inevitable is that the ice is going and this opens up the sea route. It is only one-third the distance of the current route between Europe and Asia and, of course, it is more environmentally sound to use the short cut.\u201d Autto claims the railway would help the Sami in northern Lapland. \u201cI have a Sami background myself, but the Sami-speaking population in our traditional home area has diminished to the point where if we don\u2019t find new opportunities and business activity it will totally disappear,\u201d he says. He sees no reason not to allow mines in the Sami homeland: \u201cWhy not? It has to be discussed with the local community, but it would provide livelihoods for hundreds of people directly and for thousands indirectly.\u201d Back on the darkening shores of Lake Inari, the political machinations of the regional capital seem very far away. Seuruj\u00e4rvi is warming himself up with a cup of coffee and barley bread in his kitchen. He longs to live a quiet life, but believes he must resist the railway if the next generation is to live off the forests and lakes of his ancestors. \u201cReindeer herding has been my only dream,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to give my future children the chance to live in the Sami way.\u201d \u2022 Commenting on this piece?

      "body": "<p>One Sunday I came to sit with the dead. The room was almost untouched. Everything and nothing was the same. I was standing in my grandmother\u2019s study. She had lived with us for 25 years, and died six months earlier. Her room had been cleaned and closed \u2013 the dark beetles of dried blood scrubbed from the fireplace where she fell and cracked her head. I had come to her room to sit with the silence.</p> <p>I have always found something deeply compelling about keeping quiet. It began when my grandmother moved in with us, when I was a child. Or at the edge of being a child: 13. The move shifted the family dynamic. It was a time of great upheaval, and it was during this time that I lost the ability to speak. Or not to speak, precisely, but to speak in the ways that make us human. The ways that matter. I could answer direct questions. I could take part in school plays. But I stopped making conversation for nearly a year. When I was at school, I stopped telling jokes, or asking questions. I became a lurker \u2013 always almost invisible, on the edge of conversations.</p> <p>When my grandmother moved in with us there was a corrosion: of privacy, space and time, which meant not everything was spoken. I wanted to try to compensate for some of the things unsaid. \u201cI\u2019m getting married,\u201d I whispered to the listening room.</p> <p>I never told my grandmother I had got engaged. My parents admired my new engagement ring as we sat beside her hospital bed. I wish she had known. But I never found the words to tell her that I was marrying a woman \u2013 perhaps fearing her understanding of a wedding was not elastic enough to contain two brides at the altar. In the years since I had come out she had come to develop a simultaneous soft spot for my girlfriend and utter horror of the idea of our sexual intimacy. So there was always something unspoken. I couldn\u2019t blame her. I only gave voice to my sexuality when I was in my 30s. And even then I could barely say the words: \u201clesbian\u201d, \u201cdyke\u201d and \u201cbisexuality\u201d sounded like a medical condition, so I simply muttered \u201cI like women\u201d to anyone who would listen. I think I hoped that if I said it enough times I could banish the shame and doubt that made it impossible to articulate.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was shame that seeded my early silence. And shame that kept my sexuality quiet for so long</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I had come to my grandmother\u2019s room to try to find something to read at the wedding. I scanned the shelves aimlessly, picking open old copies of Rupert Brooke, and anthologies of 20th-century love poetry. None of it was quite right. And then I saw it, an old book of mine, by George Oppen. A little known poet of the US west and east coasts. He prided himself on saying it as it was. On stripping everything back so that language could get as close as possible to the world. But at the same time his writing is incredibly sparse. It is almost as if he doesn\u2019t want words to get in the way of the thing he is describing. The poems sit like little insects on the pages. Dots against the endless white.</p> <p>I began to read, and my eye was drawn to one of the shorter poems. It was written about his wife Mary.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>That this is I,</em><br><em>Not mine, which wakes</em><br><em>To where the present</em><br><em>Sun pours in the present</em><em>, to the air perhaps</em><br><em>Of love and of </em><br><em>Conviction.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>I knew I had found it. That moment of bright optimism, and wanting to hold on to each other without taking ownership: \u201cI, not mine\u201d. These were the words I wanted to say.</p> <p>That day in my grandmother\u2019s study reignited my romance with Oppen. But as I reread his poetry on my way to and from work, I discovered that there was a silence at the heart of his writing. Between 1934 and 1962 he didn\u2019t publish a word of poetry. His letters also stop abruptly in the 1930s, resuming decades later. During this silence, his life continued apace: he joined the Communist party before going to war, when he fought the advance of Hitler during the 40s, only to return, wounded, to the US, and fall under the suspicion of Senator McCarthy. And so he fled to Mexico, and lived as an exile for almost a decade, with his wife and daughter, before returning to the States in 1958. For all of this, there are no words. Or at least, there are no words written at the time. In the poetry and letters written in the later years of his life, Oppen begins to pick through everything that happened, sifting through and making sense of it all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0a7594048ba947b93da3b5ed594848a8c9e190e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a7594048ba947b93da3b5ed594848a8c9e190e0/0_0_448_600/373.jpg\" alt=\"George Oppen didn\u2019t write poetry for 28 years\" width=\"373\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Oppen didn\u2019t write poetry for 28 years</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I couldn\u2019t understand Oppen\u2019s silence \u2013 and why a poet hailed as a \u201cserious craftsman\u201d by Ezra Pound with \u201ca sensibility not got out of other men\u2019s books\u201d, would stop writing for so long, only to win the Pulitzer once he started again, in 1968. I think perhaps I wanted to understand his silence so I could start to make sense of why I had stopped speaking, all those years ago.</p> <p>Those silent years had been haunting me. As I sat in my grandmother\u2019s study, I could see myself in the Volvo, on the long drive to secondary school, where silence first settled on me. It was a girls\u2019 boarding school, and I was one of only three day girls in a year of nearly 100. From the start I felt like an outsider. For the first two weeks of term, the boarders were not permitted to call home. Instead, they wrote letters to their parents, and arrived in chapel red-eyed every morning. After this hiatus, they were allowed 10 minutes a week to use the public pay phone in the corridor.</p> <p>Leaving school each evening became a guilty secret. I never announced when I was going, but slipped silently away. And I began to hide in the boot room during breakfast, waiting for a moment when I could slip into line unnoticed. Trunks and tuck boxes were stacked to the ceiling and the air smelt of sweat and linseed oil. No one was ever there for more than a few minutes \u2013 to collect a lacrosse stick or a textbook.</p> <p>\u201cOh, hi,\u201d they would say, \u201cI didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d<br>\u201cYeah, sorry, I was just leaving,\u201d I\u2019d reply.</p> <p>My days were bookended by awkward pauses, and as time went on the silence began to swell, until I found I had nothing to say. I never intended to stop talking \u2013 but soon keeping quiet became a habit. It felt safer, easier, somehow to say the bare minimum. I was never bullied \u2013 just ignored.</p> <p>And then my father\u2019s company had a reshuffle and he was made redundant. Silence closed over our house, and we were told not to tell anyone outside the family what was going on. In school the other girls went skiing and hung out on the Kings Road \u2013 no one else was living off credit cards and crossed fingers. \u201cBlood runs thicker than water,\u201d my mother had said, as she finished breakfast one morning, \u201cand people don\u2019t need to know about Daddy.\u201d</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t find the words to tell my family what was happening at school; it seemed irrelevant in the face of their sadness. And at school, I knew not to talk about the sadness in our unheated house \u2013 so I didn\u2019t. I took an involuntary step back from the world, and stopped telling anyone how I was feeling.</p> <p>Oppen, too, stopped writing in a moment of crisis. For him, it was being confronted with the grinding poverty of the Great Depression. He had been travelling in France, setting up a publishing house with his new wife, and living off his inheritance. But he returned to the US to find snaking soup kitchen lines, of men with nothing to eat. Fifteen million families were faced with the threat of imminent starvation, and, by 1934, 20 million people were unemployed. The previously self-assured young poet was at a loss. How could he write when all around him families were struggling to survive?</p> <p>These were real, ethical questions for Oppen. In his one published essay on the purpose of poetry, The Mind\u2019s Own Place, he recalls the words of the dramatist Bertolt Brecht, who believed that there were times when \u201cit can be almost a crime to write of trees\u201d. There are, Oppen argued, situations \u201cthat cannot honourably be met by art\u201d. Poetry was not an appropriate response to starvation. And so he and his wife Mary took up politics with a view to creating \u201cdisorder, disorder \u2013 to make it impossible to allow people to starve\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/apr/29/specificreasonstorememberg\">Specific reasons to remember George Oppen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was a power in choosing not to speak during this time. Oppen explained his silence as a way of preventing his words from being used in the service of the communist propaganda machine. And yet, there was more to his silence: shame. He came from a wealthy Jewish background, and told one correspondent he was \u201cborn of a couple of rather millionaire lines\u201d, and it seems to me that part of his reluctance to write about the Depression is because of this inheritance. His moneyed childhood was at odds with his life as a communist agitator in the 1930s. And so there was always something he held back. An element of his life that remained unsaid. As Mary admitted, in a later interview, the couple\u2019s financial security was the \u201cguilty secret\u201d, that allowed them to risk arrest on a picket line \u2013 as nothing mattered quite as much when you had money.</p> <p>It was shame, too, that seeded my early silence.

      "bodyText": "One Sunday I came to sit with the dead. The room was almost untouched. Everything and nothing was the same. I was standing in my grandmother\u2019s study. She had lived with us for 25 years, and died six months earlier. Her room had been cleaned and closed \u2013 the dark beetles of dried blood scrubbed from the fireplace where she fell and cracked her head. I had come to her room to sit with the silence. I have always found something deeply compelling about keeping quiet. It began when my grandmother moved in with us, when I was a child. Or at the edge of being a child: 13. The move shifted the family dynamic. It was a time of great upheaval, and it was during this time that I lost the ability to speak. Or not to speak, precisely, but to speak in the ways that make us human. The ways that matter. I could answer direct questions. I could take part in school plays. But I stopped making conversation for nearly a year. When I was at school, I stopped telling jokes, or asking questions. I became a lurker \u2013 always almost invisible, on the edge of conversations. When my grandmother moved in with us there was a corrosion: of privacy, space and time, which meant not everything was spoken. I wanted to try to compensate for some of the things unsaid. \u201cI\u2019m getting married,\u201d I whispered to the listening room. I never told my grandmother I had got engaged. My parents admired my new engagement ring as we sat beside her hospital bed. I wish she had known. But I never found the words to tell her that I was marrying a woman \u2013 perhaps fearing her understanding of a wedding was not elastic enough to contain two brides at the altar. In the years since I had come out she had come to develop a simultaneous soft spot for my girlfriend and utter horror of the idea of our sexual intimacy. So there was always something unspoken. I couldn\u2019t blame her. I only gave voice to my sexuality when I was in my 30s. And even then I could barely say the words: \u201clesbian\u201d, \u201cdyke\u201d and \u201cbisexuality\u201d sounded like a medical condition, so I simply muttered \u201cI like women\u201d to anyone who would listen. I think I hoped that if I said it enough times I could banish the shame and doubt that made it impossible to articulate. I had come to my grandmother\u2019s room to try to find something to read at the wedding. I scanned the shelves aimlessly, picking open old copies of Rupert Brooke, and anthologies of 20th-century love poetry. None of it was quite right. And then I saw it, an old book of mine, by George Oppen. A little known poet of the US west and east coasts. He prided himself on saying it as it was. On stripping everything back so that language could get as close as possible to the world. But at the same time his writing is incredibly sparse. It is almost as if he doesn\u2019t want words to get in the way of the thing he is describing. The poems sit like little insects on the pages. Dots against the endless white. I began to read, and my eye was drawn to one of the shorter poems. It was written about his wife Mary. That this is I, Not mine, which wakes To where the present Sun pours in the present, to the air perhaps Of love and of Conviction. I knew I had found it. That moment of bright optimism, and wanting to hold on to each other without taking ownership: \u201cI, not mine\u201d. These were the words I wanted to say. That day in my grandmother\u2019s study reignited my romance with Oppen. But as I reread his poetry on my way to and from work, I discovered that there was a silence at the heart of his writing. Between 1934 and 1962 he didn\u2019t publish a word of poetry. His letters also stop abruptly in the 1930s, resuming decades later. During this silence, his life continued apace: he joined the Communist party before going to war, when he fought the advance of Hitler during the 40s, only to return, wounded, to the US, and fall under the suspicion of Senator McCarthy. And so he fled to Mexico, and lived as an exile for almost a decade, with his wife and daughter, before returning to the States in 1958. For all of this, there are no words. Or at least, there are no words written at the time. In the poetry and letters written in the later years of his life, Oppen begins to pick through everything that happened, sifting through and making sense of it all. I couldn\u2019t understand Oppen\u2019s silence \u2013 and why a poet hailed as a \u201cserious craftsman\u201d by Ezra Pound with \u201ca sensibility not got out of other men\u2019s books\u201d, would stop writing for so long, only to win the Pulitzer once he started again, in 1968. I think perhaps I wanted to understand his silence so I could start to make sense of why I had stopped speaking, all those years ago. Those silent years had been haunting me. As I sat in my grandmother\u2019s study, I could see myself in the Volvo, on the long drive to secondary school, where silence first settled on me. It was a girls\u2019 boarding school, and I was one of only three day girls in a year of nearly 100. From the start I felt like an outsider. For the first two weeks of term, the boarders were not permitted to call home. Instead, they wrote letters to their parents, and arrived in chapel red-eyed every morning. After this hiatus, they were allowed 10 minutes a week to use the public pay phone in the corridor. Leaving school each evening became a guilty secret. I never announced when I was going, but slipped silently away. And I began to hide in the boot room during breakfast, waiting for a moment when I could slip into line unnoticed.

Long Island City, Queens, had been the <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/how-1-percent-rules/\">target of planned deindustrialization</a> for over 35 years, with a succession of governors and mayors seeking to displace manufacturing and incentivize a proliferation of bland corporate office and luxury residential developments.</p> <p>In the 1980s, Mayor Ed Koch and Governor Mario Cuomo \u2013 the father of contemporary New York governor and Amazon apologist Andrew Cuomo \u2013 turned up the heat by providing a billion-dollar subsidy to a mixed-use development called Hunters Point South.

In so doing, the anti-Amazon movement presented an anti-corporate, anti-gentrification mantel for other cities to pick up.

Public stewardship, on the other hand, is the contention that the city is a collective product of residents\u2019 labor \u2013in terms of the material production of streets and buildings, the cultural production of neighborhoods and common spaces, and the social reproduction of residents and workers. The city\u2019s fate belongs with those who made it, not just those who own it.</p> <p>If cities are products of collective labor, then gentrification, in geographer <a href=\"https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/displacement-revolution-and-the-new-urban-condition/book243244\">Ipsita Chatterjee\u2019s</a> phrase, is \u201cthe theft of space from labor and its conversion into spaces of profit\u201d. Anti-gentrification movements like the one that scared away Amazon can be understood as part of the long legacy of working class struggle against the alienation of labor by capital. In the classic cases, workers have revolted against bosses for stealing the surplus value they created; here, residents are rising up against developers and politicians for alienating people from the spaces they have built.</p> <p>The city is an expression of popular will, and that will can be summoned to upturn the plans of those who seek to usurp its labor. This kind of mobilization is key to beating back corporate power and resisting the rise of the real estate state. With Amazon on the run, the time is ripe to renew our push for public stewardship and rethink the purpose of urban planning.</p> <ul> <li><p>Samuel Stein is a PhD candidate at the CUNY Graduate Center, and the author of the forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/2870-capital-city\">Capital City: Gentrification and the Real Estate State</a></p></li> </ul>",

Clearly, this was not just a one-off fight between an obnoxious billionaire and a pissed off populace. New York\u2019s dizzying dance with Amazon tells us a lot about the state of urban politics in the United States, and the kind of fights we need to engage in if we want to alter the balance of corporate and people\u2019s power.

By luring Amazon to this particular place, Cuomo and the mayor, Bill de Blasio, were building on a long legacy of marginalizing manufacturing and courting gentrification. Ultimately, however, Bezos, Cuomo and De Blasio failed \u2013 they could not secure the consent of the people, who conducted a forceful and multi-fronted battle on the issues of housing costs, labor and immigrant rights, corporate subsidies, infrastructure demands, small business survival, and more. In so doing, the anti-Amazon movement presented an anti-corporate, anti-gentrification mantel for other cities to pick up. In fact, since New Yorkers successfully stood up to Amazon, protests in northern Virginia \u2013 Amazon\u2019s other top choice \u2013 have intensified. By rejecting the logic that cities should bend over backwards to welcome gentrifying, union-busting, homogenizing corporations, New Yorkers asserted a principle that has long been lacking in planning: that the public is the rightful steward of a city\u2019s future. That may sound obvious, but it is a major turnabout from ordinary planning practice, which has tended to privilege the rights of property owners and seek little more than advice and consent from the rest of us. Public stewardship, on the other hand, is the contention that the city is a collective product of residents\u2019 labor \u2013in terms of the material production of streets and buildings, the cultural production of neighborhoods and common spaces, and the social reproduction of residents and workers. The city\u2019s fate belongs with those who made it, not just those who own it. If cities are products of collective labor, then gentrification, in geographer Ipsita Chatterjee\u2019s phrase, is \u201cthe theft of space from labor and its conversion into spaces of profit\u201d. Anti-gentrification movements like the one that scared away Amazon can be understood as part of the long legacy of working class struggle against the alienation of labor by capital. In the classic cases, workers have revolted against bosses for stealing the surplus value they created; here, residents are rising up against developers and politicians for alienating people from the spaces they have built. The city is an expression of popular will, and that will can be summoned to upturn the plans of those who seek to usurp its labor. This kind of mobilization is key to beating back corporate power and resisting the rise of the real estate state. With Amazon on the run, the time is ripe to renew our push for public stewardship and rethink the purpose of urban planning.

On a hilltop, perhaps 500 metres away, dust is erupting in the yellow hues of dawn, shafts of early morning light shooting through, some of them interrupted by a huge, dark nebula.

The elephant approaches, and everything seems to slow \u2026 but as it sweeps its head to the right, we hit the accelerator and are away, hearts racing as the dust storm swirls downhill from us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b46b0b157502c8d97d75544d1096a07c2a2aa5e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b46b0b157502c8d97d75544d1096a07c2a2aa5e9/0_0_4784_2871/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bull elephant, silhouetted by the sunrise.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bull elephant, silhouetted by the sunrise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie Lafferty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before we came to South Africa for a campervan jaunt around the Eastern Cape, friends and family expressed concerns about our safety. Horny elephants weren\u2019t quite what they had in mind. Why not go road-tripping in America or Canada? Because, we said, that would be boring \u2013 and because South Africa, as well as neighbouring Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland) and Lesotho, offer chances to explore the unknown.</p> <p>Our plan, over 10 days, is to head north from Johannesburg to Kruger national park, then south to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/swaziland\" title=\"\">Eswatini</a>, and back west to South Africa\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.sanparks.org/parks/golden_gate/\" title=\"\">Golden Gate Highlands national park</a> and the Drakensberg, taking in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/lesotho\" title=\"\">Lesotho</a> on the way. A near 2,000-mile circuit on a less-trodden itinerary than the Garden Route, it promises contrast and freedom, though we\u2019ll drive less than four hours a day. Home is an Iveco Discoverer-4, a sort of mobile Ikea showroom, with an array of cunning space-saving tricks. Though there are just two of us, you could conceivably squeeze four adults into its two beds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3fff6a6f78fc278406cd6f5c9596592f5f8acba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3fff6a6f78fc278406cd6f5c9596592f5f8acba/0_41_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An elephant in Kruger Park, South Africa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Another elephant sidles by the author.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie Lafferty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It doesn\u2019t take us too long to get the hang of the Discoverer \u2013 and soon we have left the chaos of Jo\u2019burg behind as we head along the Long Tom Pass to Sabie (site of battles between the British and the Boers), and take in some big hitters, from Blyde River Canyon to the Graskop waterfalls.</p> <p>The weakness of the currencies here \u2013 the rand, lilangeni and loti \u2013 matches the emaciated pound, so everything feels quite affordable, including the fuel, which is always served for us. At least when we arrive at pre-booked campsites we\u2019re the ones responsible for hooking up the power, topping up our water, and cooking food from local supermarkets. Most of the campsites have restaurants, but every pitch also has a small, alfresco grill, so we barbecue most nights.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"366b50c534f6270f4e203bcb993e05d03eb9df67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/366b50c534f6270f4e203bcb993e05d03eb9df67/0_615_4888_2934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kruger, South Africa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Lafferty\u2019s campervan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie Lafferty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No, not barbecue: <em>braai</em>. Of all the South African words we are introduced to, this is the most important.

At sunset each night we watch tens of thousands of red-billed queleas shimmer erratically across the dusky sky, their tiny wings gilded by the dying sunlight. A \u201cpalpitation\u201d isn\u2019t their collective noun (there isn\u2019t one specifically), but it easily could be.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a601a26799e913d87fb4eeb9616c09fcf690a790\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a601a26799e913d87fb4eeb9616c09fcf690a790/0_137_4189_2513/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stork, impala, blue wildebeest and plains zebra, Kruger national park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stork, impala, blue wildebeest and plains zebra, Kruger national park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bjorn Grotting/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not having a guide means we can return to the Kruger\u2019s main campsite, <a href=\"http://www.krugerpark.co.za/Kruger_National_Park_Lodging_&amp;_Camping_Guide-travel/skukuza-camp.html\" title=\"\">Skukuza Rest Camp</a>, when we choose. As the animals are most active at dawn and dusk, we take the van out at least twice a day.</p> <p>Beyond the national parks, huge parts of the Eastern Cape are flat, dry and golden, with roads rolling infinitely towards the horizon. We pass those hours singing along to music on our phones and chewing biltong bought from roadside vendors. It is July, one of the colder, drier parts of the year, and the powder blue of the huge sky is only occasionally smudged by smoke from fires lit by farmers hoping to improve the fertility of their land. While the evenings and mornings are chilly, the days warm up to approximately what they\u2019d be in a British summer.

      "bodyText": "At first it looks like a storm cloud on the horizon. On a hilltop, perhaps 500 metres away, dust is erupting in the yellow hues of dawn, shafts of early morning light shooting through, some of them interrupted by a huge, dark nebula. As the bull elephant comes towards us, silhouetted by the sunrise, his intent is clear. In our rear-view mirrors, we see a jeep with a Kruger Park safari guide make a hasty three-point turn. We suddenly feel trapped in our bloated white campervan. \u201cJust tell me what to do,\u201d says Patch Walker, my friend and co-driver. This isn\u2019t my first time on safari, but I\u2019ve never been without a qualified guide before, and I\u2019ve watched enough Attenborough to know that the black ooze leaking from the elephant\u2019s face means he is in musth \u2013 and we are in serious bother. I mutter something about putting the van on the opposite side of the road to at least give our assailant room to pass. The elephant approaches, and everything seems to slow \u2026 but as it sweeps its head to the right, we hit the accelerator and are away, hearts racing as the dust storm swirls downhill from us. Before we came to South Africa for a campervan jaunt around the Eastern Cape, friends and family expressed concerns about our safety. Horny elephants weren\u2019t quite what they had in mind. Why not go road-tripping in America or Canada? Because, we said, that would be boring \u2013 and because South Africa, as well as neighbouring Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland) and Lesotho, offer chances to explore the unknown. Our plan, over 10 days, is to head north from Johannesburg to Kruger national park, then south to Eswatini, and back west to South Africa\u2019s Golden Gate Highlands national park and the Drakensberg, taking in Lesotho on the way. A near 2,000-mile circuit on a less-trodden itinerary than the Garden Route, it promises contrast and freedom, though we\u2019ll drive less than four hours a day. Home is an Iveco Discoverer-4, a sort of mobile Ikea showroom, with an array of cunning space-saving tricks. Though there are just two of us, you could conceivably squeeze four adults into its two beds. It doesn\u2019t take us too long to get the hang of the Discoverer \u2013 and soon we have left the chaos of Jo\u2019burg behind as we head along the Long Tom Pass to Sabie (site of battles between the British and the Boers), and take in some big hitters, from Blyde River Canyon to the Graskop waterfalls. The weakness of the currencies here \u2013 the rand, lilangeni and loti \u2013 matches the emaciated pound, so everything feels quite affordable, including the fuel, which is always served for us. At least when we arrive at pre-booked campsites we\u2019re the ones responsible for hooking up the power, topping up our water, and cooking food from local supermarkets. Most of the campsites have restaurants, but every pitch also has a small, alfresco grill, so we barbecue most nights. No, not barbecue: braai. Of all the South African words we are introduced to, this is the most important. We quickly learn a basic glossary of driving terms, too: indicators are \u201cflickers\u201d, the horn is a \u201chooter\u201d, roundabouts are \u201ccircles\u201d, traffic lights become \u201crobots\u201d. We spend almost three days in Kruger, covering some of the vastness of its 7,500 square miles, discussing the collective nouns for the various fauna we see: a cackle of hyena, a stubbornness of rhino, an implausibility of wildebeest. At sunset each night we watch tens of thousands of red-billed queleas shimmer erratically across the dusky sky, their tiny wings gilded by the dying sunlight. A \u201cpalpitation\u201d isn\u2019t their collective noun (there isn\u2019t one specifically), but it easily could be. Not having a guide means we can return to the Kruger\u2019s main campsite, Skukuza Rest Camp, when we choose. As the animals are most active at dawn and dusk, we take the van out at least twice a day. Beyond the national parks, huge parts of the Eastern Cape are flat, dry and golden, with roads rolling infinitely towards the horizon. We pass those hours singing along to music on our phones and chewing biltong bought from roadside vendors. It is July, one of the colder, drier parts of the year, and the powder blue of the huge sky is only occasionally smudged by smoke from fires lit by farmers hoping to improve the fertility of their land. While the evenings and mornings are chilly, the days warm up to approximately what they\u2019d be in a British summer. But there\u2019s an advantage to travelling here in the off-season \u2013 little rain and fewer tourists. The parched highways are always followed by astonishing mountain ranges and canyons, waterfalls and pine forests. In those landscapes, we go trekking whenever we can. In total we hike for more than 20 hours along five routes, encountering few people. On a trek back up from the bottom of Blyde Canyon, having visited the rocky, multi-tiered Dientje Falls, we instead meet a small troop (or congress) of baboons, which descends from the trees with a hideous alarm call. But 15 years of living in Glasgow has given us a solid grounding for such confrontations, so we pick up a rock and a stick and swear a lot, and eventually climb out above the canopy unmolested. The mountainous kingdoms of Eswatini and Lesotho feel very different from South Africa, like islands poking above the republic that surrounds them. Having used the campervan as a mobile apartment, restaurant, disco and safari jeep, in Eswatini we now take it off-road to the start of another waterfall trek, this time in the Malolotja nature reserve. The van copes amazingly well over bumps and potholes to our campsite inside the Mlilwane Wildlife Sanctuary. I stretch, then stand close to the braai to keep warm. Alas, we arrive too late to see any of the animals inside Mlilwane. Was there a journey of giraffe? Or a dazzle of zebra? We don\u2019t get to find out.

      "bodyText": "A is for Aha! Alan\u2019s catchphrase on 90s chatshow Knowing Me, Knowing You. He greeted everyone with it, even the policemen who led him away after he accidentally shot and killed a guest. Later voted 84th in Channel 4\u2019s 100 Best Catchphrases. It\u2019s now journalism law that every headline about Alan must begin with \u201cAha!\u201d. Except this one. A is also for: Abba (both Alan\u2019s son and TV show were named after the pop quartet\u2019s hits); Angela Ashbourne (Alan\u2019s girlfriend whom he met during the siege of North Norfolk Digital but who later binned him for texting a female colleague \u201ca raunchy joke that got out of hand\u201d). B is for BBC Alan\u2019s chatshow wasn\u2019t recommissioned, which led to a breakdown and Toblerone-based weight issues. Now he\u2019s back at Broadcasting House for new series This Time, a quarter-century after his BBC debut. Needless to say, he had the last laugh. B is also for: Brexit (Alan\u2019s the voice of it on This Time); Best of the Beatles (his favourite Fab Four album); Backshall, Steve and Brookes, Bruno (Alan loathes both). C is for Coogan Steve Coogan might be a Bafta winner and Oscar nominee, but Partridge remains his career-defining role, one he\u2019s played on and off for 28 years across radio, TV and film. His 2008 live tour was called Steve Coogan Is Alan Partridge and Other Less Successful Characters. C is also for: Carol (Alan\u2019s ex-wife who ran off with her fitness instructor, AKA a \u201cnarcissistic sports pimp who drinks that yellow stuff in tins\u201d); Corsodyl Mouthwash (Alan\u2019s a brand ambassador); Castrol GTX (logo on the jacket he wore to a funeral). D is for Day Today Alan made his TV debut on Chris Morris\u2019s news satire The Day Today, where his beat was sport (\u201cplus the Paralympics\u201d), despite knowing little about it. See him mistaking a 33-year-old jockey for a schoolboy. D is also for: Dan Dan the Kitchen Man (Alan\u2019s best mate, who turned out to be a \u201csex swapper\u201d); Dance, Charles (whom Alan wants to play him in a biopic). E is for East Anglia Alan\u2019s favourite area of the UK, which he poetically calls: \u201cThe plump peninsula. Albion\u2019s hind quarters. Or, quite simply, the Wales of the east.\u201d E is also for: Emily Maitlis (she makes a cameo in This Time\u2019s opening episode); ecstasy (which Alan took during hard-hitting documentary Scissored Isle, inducing \u201ca mild high, during which I felt a bit hot and couldn\u2019t stop talking about Lewis Hamilton\u201d). F is for Fernando Alan\u2019s son rarely speaks to his father, partly because he gives advice such as: \u201cFernando, you\u2019re 22 years old and you\u2019re spending your Saturday afternoon in bed with a girl. You\u2019re wasting your life. It\u2019s a beautiful day. Take her out to a local fort or a Victorian folly.\u201d Alan also has a daughter named Denise but he\u2019s less bothered about her. F is also for: Farmers (whom Alan angered with allegations of making pigs smoke and feeding beef burgers to swans); Fleetwood Mac (\u201csoft-rock cocaine enthusiasts\u201d). G is for Gibbons brothers Writer twins Neil and Rob Gibbons submitted a spec script to Coogan\u2019s company Baby Cow in 2008. They\u2019ve co-written every Partridge project since, giving the character a new lease of life. They not only wrote and directed new series This Time but Neil makes a fleeting cameo in the first episode. See if you can spot him. G is also for: Gordon (Alan\u2019s middle name); Glen Ponder (bandleader whom Alan sacked on his chatshow); Gunnell, Sally (Alan\u2019s all-time favourite athlete). H is for Hayers, Tony BBC commissioning editor, played by David Schneider, who was invited on to Christmas special Knowing Me, Knowing Yule and got hit in the face by Alan with a turkey. Later, he invited Alan to lunch to explain that his BBC career was over \u2013 cue another assault, this time with cheese. To Alan\u2019s delight, his nemesis died Rod Hull-style while adjusting the TV aerial on his roof. H is also for: Hamilton\u2019s Water Breaks (for whom Alan made a promotional video on the Norfolk Broads, hijacked by protesting farmers dropping a dead cow from a bridge on to his boat); \u201chomosceptic\u201d (how Alan describes himself, as opposed to homophobic). I is for Iannucci Armando Iannucci co-created Alan for Radio 4\u2019s On the Hour. He asked Coogan to come up with a sports presenter and recalls: \u201cWe were on the floor when we heard this voice. Someone instantly said: \u2018He\u2019s an Alan,\u2019 and someone else said: \u2018He\u2019s a Partridge.\u2019\u201d I is also for: I, Partridge: We Need to Talk About Alan (his spoof autobiography); Inverdale, John (real-life presenter prone to Partridgisms). J is for Jennie Gresham Alan\u2019s co-presenter on This Time, played by Susannah Fielding as an ambitious fembot who keeps stealing his lines. There may be trouble ahead. J is also for: \u201cJurassic Park!\u201d/\u201cJackanackanory!\u201d (more Alan expressions of triumph); Jill (receptionist whom he bedded and sacked the same night); James Bond (Alan\u2019s hero, hence his one-man re-enactment of The Spy Who Loved Me in his static caravan). K is for Knowing Me, Knowing You Alan\u2019s chatshow, which ended with the host accidentally shooting restaurant critic Forbes McAllister with Lord Byron\u2019s duelling pistol. Given one last chance with a Christmas special, Alan assaulted a BBC bigwig and a paralysed former golfer, ending his TV career. Until now. K is also for: Kate Bush (Alan performed a medley of her hits on Children in Need, which Coogan claims inspired Bush to make a live comeback herself); Knowles, Nick (\u201ca big horrible git of a man\u201d).

M is for Michael Alan\u2019s geordie mate, played by Simon Greenall. The army veteran was a hotel handyman, worked in the local BP garage and as a security guard at North Norfolk Digital. Last seen jumping off Cromer pier and declared legally dead, although no body was found. M is also for: Mid Morning Matters (Alan\u2019s show on North Norfolk Digital, home to such phone-ins as \u201cWhich is the worst monger: fish, iron, rumour or war?\u201d); Monkey Tennis (one of Alan\u2019s TV proposals, now shorthand for shoddy TV formats); Mini Kievs (his favourite canape). N is for Norwich Alan\u2019s home town. Iannucci and Coogan considered Milton Keynes but decided it was too obvious and Norwich had \u201cmore finesse\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s geographically just that little bit annoyingly too far from London and has this weird, kind of isolated feel that seemed right for Alan,\u201d says Iannucci. An Alan statue was erected in the city for Comic Relief in 2015, while its 2013 Christmas lights featured a giant sculpture of his face with laser-firing eyes. N is also for: Nomad (2016 book sequel to I, Partridge \u2013 the title is \u201cScottish for not mad\u201d); \u201cNeedless to say, I had the last laugh\u201d (phrase used 14 times in Alan\u2019s first memoir, Bouncing Back, which was pulped after poor sales). O is for On the Hour Radio 4 news spoof where Alan was born in 1991. Patrick Marber, Stewart Lee and Richard Herring wrote much of his early material. O is also for: Owl sanctuary (Alan\u2019s favoured date venue); Oddie, Bill (one of Alan\u2019s few remaining celebrity friends). P is for Pear Tree Productions Alan\u2019s production company, until he fired the entire workforce rather than downsize his car. It went into liquidation, but Alan prefers to think of it as \u201ca sleeping volcano, always ready to ejaculate hot TV content into the air and over the surrounding land\u201d. P is also for: Pat Farrell (fellow North Norfolk Digital DJ who was sacked during a corporate takeover in 2013 film Alpha Papa and returned with a shotgun to hold employees hostage); the Police (\u201cor as they\u2019re now known, Sting\u201d). Q is for Queen Elizabeth Hospital Alan\u2019s birthplace in King\u2019s Lynn, on 2 April 1955. A midwife held the baby aloft like a \u201cfleshy World Cup\u201d. Q is also for: Quaddy (imaginary water monster which Alan feared in childhood, meaning he refused to go swimming for five years). R is for Radio Alan\u2019s first love.

T is for This Time Alan\u2019s new series: a weekday evening magazine show that bears a certain resemblance to The One Show. A perfect fit for the man whose broadcasting style was described by Ross Kemp as \u201cequidistant between chitchat and analysis\u201d.

U is for U2 The stadium rock bores provided two plot points in I\u2019m Alan Partridge. Alan offended Irish TV execs by misunderstanding Sunday Bloody Sunday (\u201cit really encapsulates the frustration of a Sunday\u201d).

As the match progresses, the playable area contracts, forcing the competitors closer together. The last person standing wins.</p> <p>This is of course battle royale, a new type of online shooting game currently being enjoyed by over 200 million people across the globe. The current craze started with Day Z: Battle Royale, a modification of the zombie survival game DayZ developed by lone designer Brendan Greene, later updated as PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battle Royale. Its popularity caught the attention of Korean developer Bluehole, who employed Greene to oversee development of a full game. PUBG was launched as a beta in early 2017 and by December, it had 30 million players.</p> <p>Noticing this success, Epic Games released a free battle royale version of its online co-op game Fortnite, offering a cartoony visual style and a Minecraft-style construction element. That was September 2017. The following year, the game earned $2.4bn from players\u2019 purchases. Last October, Activision added a battle royale mode named Blackout to Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, and on 4 February, Respawn Entertainment launched Apex: Legends. Within a week, it had gathered 10 million players, rocket-boosting publisher Electronic Arts\u2019 share value.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/feb/05/apex-legends-games-battle-royale-shooter\">Apex Legends \u2013 Fortnite meets Overwatch as Respawn joins battle royale fray</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even though the visual styles and narrative settings of these games are very different, the four giants of the genre adhere to a strict set of conventions. The islands are scattered with towns, villages, and industrial complexes, they all have rivers and bridges and offshore isles and they\u2019re all roughly the same shape. But what makes them so compelling? Why is a generation of kids is probably more comfortable navigating from Tilted Towers to Paradise Palms than they are from home to the shops?</p> <p>Dave Curd is the world art director on PUBG. He\u2019s been designing first-person shooter maps for years, and the first thing he says about the layout of battle royale landscapes is that there\u2019s never anything accidental about the way that towns and other scenic features are dispersed. Everything is driven by a combination of design and technical considerations. \u201cIf you put cities too close together, players aren\u2019t incentivised to leave, but put them too far apart and players get bored of the journey in between,\u201d he says. \u201cAlso, you don\u2019t want five or six cities crowded together or you can run into too many assets loading at once.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"24bd391b80d977ed0c8d9aad7c35d9a8121c8329\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24bd391b80d977ed0c8d9aad7c35d9a8121c8329/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds, major settlements are carefully spaced out so players are incentivised to keep moving.

When his team set out to create a battle royale map, they initially tried to bring in their experience from traditional first-person shooters, but that proved to be a mistake. \u201cMany of those map guidelines that worked for multiplayer needed to be rewritten or removed,\u201d he says. \u201cCertain things like the definition of a structure, the entrance/exit requirements need to be modified and updated \u2026 We had to spend a lot of time in early development carefully describing the variety and locations of destinations on the map, and how they related to one another.\u201d</p> <p>Battle royale maps provide a lot of liminal spaces between intense combat zones, and managing how players transition around the map \u2013 especially how they enter and exit important areas \u2013 is vital. \u201cWe wanted variety, so that assaulting or fleeing [an area] is special,\u201d says Vonderhaar. \u201cTopography helped achieve that. Sometimes destinations are uphill (Asylum), in the middle of a dense forest (The Hind Clearing), or require crossing flat, exposed terrain (Cargo).\u201d In a game type where players create their own stories, arriving at a location \u2013 or evacuating it at speed \u2013 are important elements.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjiaMBk6rHk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BjiaMBk6rHk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Some scenic elements crop up again and again, because they\u2019re useful for creating specific player experiences, which is generally difficult in a vast open space. \u201cOne of the big challenges of designing a battle royale map is that players can approach from any direction, including landing right in the middle of it,\u201d says Curd. \u201cSo we use areas like small islands and long bridges to create bottlenecks and chokepoints, and to intentionally encourage certain types of gameplay. In those small areas, we have a very good idea how people will interact. It\u2019s kind of fun for players to camp a bridge, to feel smart, to feel like highwaymen.\u201d</p> <p>Another vital design element is the use of tall architectural structures such as masts and towers. Partly this is about adding verticality to the play space, which was the impetus behind Blackout\u2019s towering construction site area, with its uncompleted skyscraper. However, it\u2019s also about helping players to figure out where they are.</p> <p>\u201cThese maps are really 90% nature and 10% manmade architecture, so the latter has to stand out, it has to break the horizon line,\u201d says Curd. \u201cThe use of vertical architecture as navigation points is pivotal \u2013 we need to landmark so that players inherently understand where they are in relation to each other. You have to see it from 2km to know where you\u2019re going. Tall or unique structures act as very natural markers. It means players don\u2019t have to keep yelling, \u2018He\u2019s over there in the trees.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>What is fascinating is how the designers of battle royale maps use subtle environmental bait to get players moving and exploring. \u201cWe use clumps of cover as little areas of safety to tempt the players,\u201d says Curd. \u201cWhether that\u2019s your typical crate or barrel pile, an old flipped over truck, a long wall or a small shack, you\u2019d be surprised how much you can influence the player with both smart loot placement and cover placement at sprintable distances. Players can do that risk-reward calculation of, \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to be exposed for a few seconds, but then I\u2019m going to have access to five new buildings, and buildings are the prize because they have loot, but more importantly they have windows I can sight from.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Vondehaar concurs: \u201cWe never want the player to feel like they aren\u2019t making progress moving across the map because there isn\u2019t anything to get to. If you were to take a ruler a measure between any two destinations in Blackout, you\u2019d see what we think is our sweet spot.\u201d</p> <p>Environmental storytelling is also important to holding players\u2019 interest. Epic Games has excelled at this with Fortnite, creating its own mythology via falling meteors, mysterious hatches, intriguing posters and TV screens showing images that hint at new game features. The landscape is constantly evolving and players love to speculate on what it all means.</p> <p>In a more subtle way, battle royale games rely on scenic features to hint at a sense of history. \u201cWe use low-level stuff, like adding wear and tear to objects, to suggest these places are abandoned or that the occupants left in a hurry,\u201d says Curd. \u201cWe can also be more overt \u2013 in the Sanhok map there are training-ground locations where you\u2019ll find hints that this might be a training facility for actual battle royale combatants. We don\u2019t want to hit the player over the head with story, but we\u2019re leaving clues to gently breadcrumb them along.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f85310abcd335dcf54b2a5216098faad18ac16b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f85310abcd335dcf54b2a5216098faad18ac16b8/0_36_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Fortnite makes careful use of environmental story-telling, both within map designs and through major events such as comet falls\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fortnite makes careful use of environmental storytelling within map designs and through major events.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Epic Games/Paul Tassi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All the successful battle royale titles know the importance of subtlety. Whether you\u2019re exploring the crypts of Haunted Hills or the metallic corridors of the Hydro Dam in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/feb/15/apex-legends-review-fortnite-has-some-stiff-competition\">Apex Legends</a>, you won\u2019t find complex multi-level floor layouts, and you won\u2019t find masses of furniture \u2013 all the buildings are rather square and the rooms rather empty. Partly this is to ensure players can quickly spot useful items amid purely decorative objects, but it is also about gameplay. \u201cYou want relatively simple interiors so that players can use hearing effectively,\u201d says Curd. \u201cThey need to be able to know the other player is upstairs, they\u2019re below, they\u2019re just outside \u2013 if we made our structures too complex, it would be really difficult to play the game. Sound is such a big deal and our simple approach to interior design reflects that.\u201d</p> <p>As with any \u201clive\u201d game that\u2019s played by thousands or millions at a time, iteration drives the design process. \u201cWe playtest rigorously,\u2019\u201d says Curd. \u201cIt\u2019s literally like designing an enormous first-person shooter map. We have the same principles of design: fun drives decisions. If we try something, no matter how cool it looks, no matter what we thought we wanted, if the playtests don\u2019t prove it out, it gets the boot.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jul/16/from-fortnite-to-love-island-how-the-battle-royale-fight-to-the-death-came-to-define-our-times\">From Fortnite to Love Island: how the \u2018fight to the death\u2019 defines our times</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Iterating on the studio\u2019s own ideas is only part of the process \u2013 a successful battle royale developer also needs to understand the variety of needs from potential players. An important element of this process is categorising them \u2013 run\u2019n\u2019gun fanatics, explorers, snipers \u2013 then making sure there are areas for all of them. \u201cWhen you have a game that reaches as many as ours does you have to realise that they\u2019re not all going to be your typical FPS high-conflict gamer, especially in our Asian markets,\u201d says Curd. \u201cWe have a sizeable number of players who enjoy the survival aspect: looting, hiding, sneaking. Some players don\u2019t even go for guns \u2013 they enjoy the tactics of hiding and outsmarting other players, and getting to the next circle.</p> <p>\u201cI am an SMG and shotgun player, so I\u2019m always going to make sure there is something for people who like to get into close-quarters combat. But we know we have a hell of a lot of expert snipers, so we want areas with less foliage, stark terrain, so you can really see those figures against that blistering orange sun. If you go to a town and there\u2019s a large apartment building with lots of windows, we want players to feel that stress of, \u2018Is anyone watching me?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Curd traces the lineage of this design approach to an unexpected source. \u201cWith Dark Souls, people were excited about how it was difficult and opaque,\u201d he says. \u201cIt proved there was an appetite for opacity in design, for not doling information out to players so directly. The battle royale genre has proven that players can tolerate really high-stress situations, really opaque choices, and not always knowing the clearest way to play.\u201d</p> <p>Studios use maps not just as interesting combinations of rural and urban locations, but for storytelling, as props to the narratives that players create as they play. Buildings are there to hide items but they\u2019re also navigational tools; bridges provide access but also choke points to encourage shootouts. Players aren\u2019t told any of this \u2013 they have to learn how to read and understand a battle royale environment, like a rambler picking up subtle clues from the local vegetation, from the flow of a stream, or the direction of a hedgerow. The worlds are open and free to roam through \u2013 nothing is directed. And the unpredictable interactions between these systems of freedom and direction are as much fun to watch as they are to play: a valuable asset in this era of Twitch streamers and YouTube superstars.</p> <p>\u201cWhenever you ask someone about their first victory, I guarantee you they have a little story about how they got there,\u201d says Curd. \u201cThese games are high stakes, high danger, high challenge, and that\u2019s super satisfying \u2026 We want to be tested. We want to be pushed.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A group of people drop on to a large island. For the next 20 minutes they must search buildings for useful weapons and equipment, before fighting to the death. As the match progresses, the playable area contracts, forcing the competitors closer together. The last person standing wins. This is of course battle royale, a new type of online shooting game currently being enjoyed by over 200 million people across the globe. The current craze started with Day Z: Battle Royale, a modification of the zombie survival game DayZ developed by lone designer Brendan Greene, later updated as PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battle Royale. Its popularity caught the attention of Korean developer Bluehole, who employed Greene to oversee development of a full game. PUBG was launched as a beta in early 2017 and by December, it had 30 million players. Noticing this success, Epic Games released a free battle royale version of its online co-op game Fortnite, offering a cartoony visual style and a Minecraft-style construction element. That was September 2017. The following year, the game earned $2.4bn from players\u2019 purchases. Last October, Activision added a battle royale mode named Blackout to Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, and on 4 February, Respawn Entertainment launched Apex: Legends. Within a week, it had gathered 10 million players, rocket-boosting publisher Electronic Arts\u2019 share value. Even though the visual styles and narrative settings of these games are very different, the four giants of the genre adhere to a strict set of conventions. The islands are scattered with towns, villages, and industrial complexes, they all have rivers and bridges and offshore isles and they\u2019re all roughly the same shape. But what makes them so compelling? Why is a generation of kids is probably more comfortable navigating from Tilted Towers to Paradise Palms than they are from home to the shops? Dave Curd is the world art director on PUBG. He\u2019s been designing first-person shooter maps for years, and the first thing he says about the layout of battle royale landscapes is that there\u2019s never anything accidental about the way that towns and other scenic features are dispersed. Everything is driven by a combination of design and technical considerations. \u201cIf you put cities too close together, players aren\u2019t incentivised to leave, but put them too far apart and players get bored of the journey in between,\u201d he says. \u201cAlso, you don\u2019t want five or six cities crowded together or you can run into too many assets loading at once.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a sweet spot where it\u2019s fun and performs well for everybody, and we get there by lots of playtests and lots of analysing data in the field,\u201d he explains. \u201cEvery map, you\u2019ll notice the art gets a little better and the assets are a little more dispersed \u2013 we\u2019re always learning.\u201d David Vonderhaar is the studio design director at Treyarch, the veteran Call of Duty developer behind the new Blackout mode. When his team set out to create a battle royale map, they initially tried to bring in their experience from traditional first-person shooters, but that proved to be a mistake. \u201cMany of those map guidelines that worked for multiplayer needed to be rewritten or removed,\u201d he says. \u201cCertain things like the definition of a structure, the entrance/exit requirements need to be modified and updated \u2026 We had to spend a lot of time in early development carefully describing the variety and locations of destinations on the map, and how they related to one another.\u201d Battle royale maps provide a lot of liminal spaces between intense combat zones, and managing how players transition around the map \u2013 especially how they enter and exit important areas \u2013 is vital. \u201cWe wanted variety, so that assaulting or fleeing [an area] is special,\u201d says Vonderhaar. \u201cTopography helped achieve that. Sometimes destinations are uphill (Asylum), in the middle of a dense forest (The Hind Clearing), or require crossing flat, exposed terrain (Cargo).\u201d In a game type where players create their own stories, arriving at a location \u2013 or evacuating it at speed \u2013 are important elements. Some scenic elements crop up again and again, because they\u2019re useful for creating specific player experiences, which is generally difficult in a vast open space. \u201cOne of the big challenges of designing a battle royale map is that players can approach from any direction, including landing right in the middle of it,\u201d says Curd. \u201cSo we use areas like small islands and long bridges to create bottlenecks and chokepoints, and to intentionally encourage certain types of gameplay. In those small areas, we have a very good idea how people will interact. It\u2019s kind of fun for players to camp a bridge, to feel smart, to feel like highwaymen.\u201d Another vital design element is the use of tall architectural structures such as masts and towers. Partly this is about adding verticality to the play space, which was the impetus behind Blackout\u2019s towering construction site area, with its uncompleted skyscraper. However, it\u2019s also about helping players to figure out where they are. \u201cThese maps are really 90% nature and 10% manmade architecture, so the latter has to stand out, it has to break the horizon line,\u201d says Curd. \u201cThe use of vertical architecture as navigation points is pivotal \u2013 we need to landmark so that players inherently understand where they are in relation to each other. You have to see it from 2km to know where you\u2019re going. Tall or unique structures act as very natural markers. It means players don\u2019t have to keep yelling, \u2018He\u2019s over there in the trees.\u2019\u201d What is fascinating is how the designers of battle royale maps use subtle environmental bait to get players moving and exploring. \u201cWe use clumps of cover as little areas of safety to tempt the players,\u201d says Curd. \u201cWhether that\u2019s your typical crate or barrel pile, an old flipped over truck, a long wall or a small shack, you\u2019d be surprised how much you can influence the player with both smart loot placement and cover placement at sprintable distances. Players can do that risk-reward calculation of, \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to be exposed for a few seconds, but then I\u2019m going to have access to five new buildings, and buildings are the prize because they have loot, but more importantly they have windows I can sight from.\u2019\u201d Vondehaar concurs: \u201cWe never want the player to feel like they aren\u2019t making progress moving across the map because there isn\u2019t anything to get to. If you were to take a ruler a measure between any two destinations in Blackout, you\u2019d see what we think is our sweet spot.\u201d Environmental storytelling is also important to holding players\u2019 interest. Epic Games has excelled at this with Fortnite, creating its own mythology via falling meteors, mysterious hatches, intriguing posters and TV screens showing images that hint at new game features. The landscape is constantly evolving and players love to speculate on what it all means. In a more subtle way, battle royale games rely on scenic features to hint at a sense of history. \u201cWe use low-level stuff, like adding wear and tear to objects, to suggest these places are abandoned or that the occupants left in a hurry,\u201d says Curd. \u201cWe can also be more overt \u2013 in the Sanhok map there are training-ground locations where you\u2019ll find hints that this might be a training facility for actual battle royale combatants. We don\u2019t want to hit the player over the head with story, but we\u2019re leaving clues to gently breadcrumb them along.\u201d All the successful battle royale titles know the importance of subtlety. Whether you\u2019re exploring the crypts of Haunted Hills or the metallic corridors of the Hydro Dam in Apex Legends, you won\u2019t find complex multi-level floor layouts, and you won\u2019t find masses of furniture \u2013 all the buildings are rather square and the rooms rather empty. Partly this is to ensure players can quickly spot useful items amid purely decorative objects, but it is also about gameplay. \u201cYou want relatively simple interiors so that players can use hearing effectively,\u201d says Curd. \u201cThey need to be able to know the other player is upstairs, they\u2019re below, they\u2019re just outside \u2013 if we made our structures too complex, it would be really difficult to play the game. Sound is such a big deal and our simple approach to interior design reflects that.\u201d As with any \u201clive\u201d game that\u2019s played by thousands or millions at a time, iteration drives the design process. \u201cWe playtest rigorously,\u2019\u201d says Curd. \u201cIt\u2019s literally like designing an enormous first-person shooter map. We have the same principles of design: fun drives decisions. If we try something, no matter how cool it looks, no matter what we thought we wanted, if the playtests don\u2019t prove it out, it gets the boot.\u201d Iterating on the studio\u2019s own ideas is only part of the process \u2013 a successful battle royale developer also needs to understand the variety of needs from potential players. An important element of this process is categorising them \u2013 run\u2019n\u2019gun fanatics, explorers, snipers \u2013 then making sure there are areas for all of them. \u201cWhen you have a game that reaches as many as ours does you have to realise that they\u2019re not all going to be your typical FPS high-conflict gamer, especially in our Asian markets,\u201d says Curd. \u201cWe have a sizeable number of players who enjoy the survival aspect: looting, hiding, sneaking. Some players don\u2019t even go for guns \u2013 they enjoy the tactics of hiding and outsmarting other players, and getting to the next circle. \u201cI am an SMG and shotgun player, so I\u2019m always going to make sure there is something for people who like to get into close-quarters combat. But we know we have a hell of a lot of expert snipers, so we want areas with less foliage, stark terrain, so you can really see those figures against that blistering orange sun. If you go to a town and there\u2019s a large apartment building with lots of windows, we want players to feel that stress of, \u2018Is anyone watching me?\u2019\u201d Curd traces the lineage of this design approach to an unexpected source. \u201cWith Dark Souls, people were excited about how it was difficult and opaque,\u201d he says. \u201cIt proved there was an appetite for opacity in design, for not doling information out to players so directly. The battle royale genre has proven that players can tolerate really high-stress situations, really opaque choices, and not always knowing the clearest way to play.\u201d Studios use maps not just as interesting combinations of rural and urban locations, but for storytelling, as props to the narratives that players create as they play. Buildings are there to hide items but they\u2019re also navigational tools; bridges provide access but also choke points to encourage shootouts. Players aren\u2019t told any of this \u2013 they have to learn how to read and understand a battle royale environment, like a rambler picking up subtle clues from the local vegetation, from the flow of a stream, or the direction of a hedgerow. The worlds are open and free to roam through \u2013 nothing is directed. And the unpredictable interactions between these systems of freedom and direction are as much fun to watch as they are to play: a valuable asset in this era of Twitch streamers and YouTube superstars. \u201cWhenever you ask someone about their first victory, I guarantee you they have a little story about how they got there,\u201d says Curd. \u201cThese games are high stakes, high danger, high challenge, and that\u2019s super satisfying \u2026 We want to be tested. We want to be pushed.\u201d",

The threshold for receiving observer status is statutorily less stringent.

Some of these sports have been waiting for years. Their perception may be that MMA has gotten too popular and there is a risk here that MMA gets recognized and jumps ahead of us to the Olympic Games.\u201d</p> <p>This would be ironic considering that as professional MMA was endangered by political forces in the mid-to-late 1990s, proponents, especially in the US, often likened MMA\u2019s action to what it would look like if the IOC-approved combat sports were combined. The idea was to assuage detractors that there was nothing indecent or morally suspect about a sport that despite its troubles continued to generate interest across the globe.</p>",

GAISF observer applicants must show examples of good governance (e.g. audited accounts, minutes of general assemblies, information on elections, directors gender balance, youth development) and justify why they are not a rival in conflict with member federations. Six of the GAISF-recognized combat sports are scheduled to appear at the 2020 Games in Tokyo, and will be eligible to receive pieces of the lucrative Olympic revenue pie. The IOC distributed $540m to the international federations whose sports were active during the 2016 Games in Rio. Thus far none of GAISF\u2019s martial arts and combat sports federations \u2013 aikido, boxing, fencing, judo, ju-jitsu, karate, kendo, kickboxing, Muay Thai, Pankration, sambo, savate, sumo, taekwondo, wrestling and wushu \u2013 have made a formal rivalry claim against MMA\u2019s bid, according to the IMMAF-WMMAA, however behind the scenes White said several members have mentioned the possibility. \u201cThe only rivalry that GAISF has ever brought to our attention was between ourselves and the WMMAA,\u201d White said. \u201cWe were told without resolving this we could not become a member.\u201d The affiliated groups now operate under one calendar and will host a joint world championship in Bahrain this November, at which time the federation\u2019s quadrennial ordinary general assembly is set to take place. Behind closed doors, objections to MMA have also postured a core element of the sport \u2013 striking on the floor \u2013 as contra to the spirit of Olympic movement. White said critics inside GAISF told him that the violence produced by MMA contests can be addressed by eliminating its ground-and-pound component \u2013 a true differentiator relative to other combat sports \u2013 and could clear the road to recognition. But considering that MMA effectively morphed into a unique martial arts style that is rooted in the techniques of an assortment of combat sports, White called the request \u201ca trap\u201d, suggesting of that if IMMAF-WMMAA complies existing GAISF members \u201cwill have a rivalry argument\u201d, never mind that the sport simply won\u2019t function like MMA anymore. Over the past three years as IMMAF-WMMAA participated in the application process, including numerous workshops and discussions, White also heard about the supposed risk MMA might pose of siphoning off athletes from other sports. \u201cThere is a fear, I believe, that MMA is growing too quickly and I think they\u2019re concerned about the commercial impact it\u2019s going to have on them,\u201d White said. \u201cThey may even be concerned that it may hinder their entry into the Olympic Games programme. Some of these sports have been waiting for years. Their perception may be that MMA has gotten too popular and there is a risk here that MMA gets recognized and jumps ahead of us to the Olympic Games.\u201d This would be ironic considering that as professional MMA was endangered by political forces in the mid-to-late 1990s, proponents, especially in the US, often likened MMA\u2019s action to what it would look like if the IOC-approved combat sports were combined. The idea was to assuage detractors that there was nothing indecent or morally suspect about a sport that despite its troubles continued to generate interest across the globe.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cBut if we get rid of all the paedophiles, we won\u2019t have any estate agents/plumbers/accountants left!\u201d wailed literally no one ever. And yet, this plaint is regularly repeated when it comes to artists accused of abusive behaviour, even now, after everything. Because, really, how can we possibly expect people to make decent music without committing some casual sexual abuse?</p> <p>Last week, the New York Times published allegations of psychological and sexual abuse against navel-gazing indie bore Ryan Adams, all of which he denies. Several women, including his ex-wife, Mandy Moore, claimed Adams\u2019 behaviour put them off the music industry. One young woman, referred to as Ava, said she and Adams started having Skype sex when she was 15 years old. \u201cIf people knew, they would say I was like R Kelly lol,\u201d Adams allegedly wrote to her. Lol.</p> <p>Up until now, my main feeling about Adams, whenever I heard his name on the radio, was irritation that he wasn\u2019t the clearly far superior Bryan Adams. But it turns out that to other people Adams is not just a singer: he is <em>the whole of music</em>.</p> <p>\u201cIf Ryan Adams can be ruined for his creepy behaviour, most of rock will go down with him,\u201d was the headline on <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/ryan-adams-can-ruined-creepy-behaviour-rock-will-go/\" title=\"\">one column</a> last week, as if that were a bad thing. I guess I missed the meeting where it was decided art matters more than people. \u201cI\u2019m inclined to think you can\u2019t make good art without being a flawed human being,\u201d the column concludes. It\u2019s not just the artist who must suffer in the name of good art, but those around him, apparently.</p> <p>A similar argument was made recently about the director Bryan Singer, after the Atlantic published <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/bryan-singers-accusers-speak-out/580462/\" title=\"\">multiple allegations of child abuse</a> against him, all of which Singer denies. When asked if this gave him pause about producing Singer\u2019s next film, Red Sonja, producer Avi Lerner dismissed the story as \u201cfake news\u201d and <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/bryan-singer-keep-red-sonja-directing-gig-new-accusers-speak-1178785\" title=\"\">added</a>, \u201cThe over $800m Bohemian Rhapsody has grossed, making it the highest grossing drama in film history, is testament to his remarkable vision and acumen.\u201d Yeah, what are a few child sex allegations next to a massive pile of money? After some people suggested this was not an appropriate response, Lerner apologised and Red Sonja is now, to use the industry euphemism, on hiatus.</p> <p>Last year\u2019s 100th anniversary of Egon Schiele\u2019s death sparked arguments about the artist\u2019s personal life and art. Schiele spent time in prison for having sex with a 13-year-old; he was ultimately acquitted of rape but found guilty of exposing the children who posed for him to pornography.

      "bodyText": "\u201cBut if we get rid of all the paedophiles, we won\u2019t have any estate agents/plumbers/accountants left!\u201d wailed literally no one ever. And yet, this plaint is regularly repeated when it comes to artists accused of abusive behaviour, even now, after everything. Because, really, how can we possibly expect people to make decent music without committing some casual sexual abuse? Last week, the New York Times published allegations of psychological and sexual abuse against navel-gazing indie bore Ryan Adams, all of which he denies. Several women, including his ex-wife, Mandy Moore, claimed Adams\u2019 behaviour put them off the music industry. One young woman, referred to as Ava, said she and Adams started having Skype sex when she was 15 years old. \u201cIf people knew, they would say I was like R Kelly lol,\u201d Adams allegedly wrote to her. Lol. Up until now, my main feeling about Adams, whenever I heard his name on the radio, was irritation that he wasn\u2019t the clearly far superior Bryan Adams. But it turns out that to other people Adams is not just a singer: he is the whole of music. \u201cIf Ryan Adams can be ruined for his creepy behaviour, most of rock will go down with him,\u201d was the headline on one column last week, as if that were a bad thing. I guess I missed the meeting where it was decided art matters more than people. \u201cI\u2019m inclined to think you can\u2019t make good art without being a flawed human being,\u201d the column concludes. It\u2019s not just the artist who must suffer in the name of good art, but those around him, apparently. A similar argument was made recently about the director Bryan Singer, after the Atlantic published multiple allegations of child abuse against him, all of which Singer denies. When asked if this gave him pause about producing Singer\u2019s next film, Red Sonja, producer Avi Lerner dismissed the story as \u201cfake news\u201d and added, \u201cThe over $800m Bohemian Rhapsody has grossed, making it the highest grossing drama in film history, is testament to his remarkable vision and acumen.\u201d Yeah, what are a few child sex allegations next to a massive pile of money? After some people suggested this was not an appropriate response, Lerner apologised and Red Sonja is now, to use the industry euphemism, on hiatus. Last year\u2019s 100th anniversary of Egon Schiele\u2019s death sparked arguments about the artist\u2019s personal life and art. Schiele spent time in prison for having sex with a 13-year-old; he was ultimately acquitted of rape but found guilty of exposing the children who posed for him to pornography. When the New York Times described him as an abuser, some were outraged. \u201cSchiele\u2019s sexual escapades were fully in keeping with the norm for a bourgeois young man [in early 20th-century Austria]\u201d, the Art Newspaper insisted. But given the controversy that Schiele caused in his own lifetime, including being driven out of one town for his relationship with a teenager, this seems debatable. \u201cOh, but it was the 1900s/the 60s/the 70s! Everyone was doing that then!\u201d the defenders always cry. Yet only, really, in regards to men in the entertainment or creative industries.

Worried about his big brother\u2019s hospital stay, Charlie unexpectedly turns into a pigeon \u2013 then continues changing into random fauna whenever he\u2019s stressed, be it by his nemesis or the imminent school play. A supportive cast of friends (fiendishly clever Flora in particular), subtly planted strategies for coping with worry, and some joyfully silly metanarrative tricks (including a publisher\u2019s letter of apology) place Charlie head and shoulders above the competition; Sarah Horne\u2019s wild-haired, twitch-eyed illustrations add another layer to the fun. In Alex Milway\u2019s Hotel Flamingo (Piccadilly), meanwhile, little Anna Dupont has inherited the run-down hotel of the title \u2013 but it\u2019s a far cry from its glory days. With diligence, tact (especially in handling irascible chef Madame la Pig), courage and kindness, Anna soon has the Flamingo shipshape again. But will it satisfy the feline inspector? Crammed full of characterful animal illustrations with accents of zinging pink, this flamboyant early chapter book is a splendid, unpreachy testament to the power of hard work. From Bloomsbury, Fantastically Great Women Who Worked Wonders is the third in Kate Pankhurst\u2019s colourful picture-book celebrations of notable females; with their playful use of speech bubbles and perspective shifts, they remain significantly more engaging and inspiring than the rival Rebel Girls. This collection of pioneering entomologists, aeronauts and surgeons is not just the usual suspects \u2013 the lineup includes Sophie Blanchard, Maria Sibylla Merian and Rosa May Billinghurst. Sophie Blackall\u2019s Caldecott-winning Hello Lighthouse (Orchard) is sophisticated, joyous and melancholy, and evokes, via its crashing waves and seductive cross-sections, a tremendous sense of place and time. The lighthouse\u2019s sporadic flashes of greeting (\u201cHello! \u2026 Hello! \u2026 Hello!\u201d) welcome first the new keeper and then his wife, who love their tall home in all weathers, especially when their baby is born there. But once the light is automated, the family must leave. A secret fold-out at the end makes for a breathtaking conclusion to this beautiful picture book, rich in saturated ink and pellucid watercolour. A little boy and his lovably naughty pet dragon Zibbo enjoy roaring, adventurous fun in Steve \u201cMr Panda\u201d Antony\u2019s new book, Amazing (Hodder). The hero uses a wheelchair, the supporting cast is quietly and intriguingly diverse, but this is a story about the shared joys of imagination rather than one focused on disability as something \u201cspecial\u201d to be set apart and examined. It\u2019s a blast \u2013 especially when Zibbo gets excited about blowing out candles. More exuberant cheerfulness blazes from The Truth About Old People by Elina Ellis (Two Hoots). \u201cThey\u201d may say old people are slow, not bendy and not much fun \u2013 but Ellis\u2019s noisy, bright, dynamic pages, filled with grandparents riding rollercoasters, smooching, dancing and flipping whole stackfuls of pancakes, assert that the elderly, too, can be anarchically amazing. In YA, Fierce Fragile Hearts (Macmillan), Sara Barnard\u2019s magnificent sequel lives up to her bestselling debut, Beautiful Broken Things. Close friends Caddy, Rosie and Suzanne are parting ways; while the former are off to university, Suzanne is living independently, alone for the first time. Navigating the legacy of her abusive childhood, including PTSD, is hard \u2013 but although there may be no quick fix, Suzanne\u2019s strength, hard-won self-knowledge and her friends\u2019 love will help her forge a future. Likely to induce at least one crying fit, and also dryly funny. Told in the third-person present, Sharon Dogar\u2019s Monsters (Andersen), an account of Mary Shelley\u2019s revolutionary life and artistic development, is poignant, lush and satisfying \u2013 a thought-provoking book. Immersing the reader by turns in the perspectives of Mary, her step-sister Claire, and husband Percy Shelley, it demonstrates how the pain of grief, abandonment and public censure might prepare the ground for the creation of monsters. The loss of Mary\u2019s first child is especially vivid. The Love and Lies of Rukhsana Ali (Scholastic) by Sabina Khan features another strong-willed, rule\u2011breaking girl suffering for the freedom to love. Rukhsana\u2019s conservative parents don\u2019t permit crop tops, parties or alcohol \u2013 and when they discover Rukhsana has a girlfriend, she is promptly sent to Bangladesh to be married off. But she finds an unlikely ally in her grandmother \u2026 Though nuance is occasionally lacking, the book\u2019s focused anger and defiance, and the detail of lives blighted by rigid notions of \u201chonour\u201d, give it considerable power.",

      "body": "<p>I was living in Norwich when the Brexit referendum happened. The city voted remain, an island of European feeling separated from Cambridge \u2013 the next dot in the remainer archipelago \u2013 by 60 miles of rural and small town leaverdom. One morning not long afterwards, in the small hours, a local deli selling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/19/romanians-in-london-brexit-immigration-photo-essay\" title=\"\">Romanian produce</a> was firebombed. No one was hurt, although people were sleeping in a flat over the shop when it happened. A crowdfunding appeal quickly raised almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/10/justgiving-norwich-eastern-european-village-shop-fire\" title=\"\">\u00a330,000 for the damaged business</a>.</p> <p>A few days later I went with my infant son to a rally for tolerance held in the market square in response to the attack. The numbers were pitifully few. I remember looking round at my fellow demonstrators, the elderly liberals and the hippies, and thinking none of us would be much good in a street fight. Tolerance was all very well, but what if we had to defend ourselves? My psychic response to the leaver neurosis of remainers as \u201cthe arrogant elite\u201d was an equally neurotic identification with the persecuted of history, as if the 52% were about to systematically Other and repress the 48% en masse.</p> <p>It was a jittery and unsettling time. I doubt I was alone among remain voters in feeling, for the first week or two after the referendum, that sleep-reducing ball of anxiety in the pit of my stomach which signifies the perception not just that a deeply wrong event has occurred, but that the very framework within which events of any kind occur has been broken.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21d91629fc64a8a20efadd915dfdf8e5afd89689\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21d91629fc64a8a20efadd915dfdf8e5afd89689/0_233_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An anti-Brexit demonstrator outside the Houses of Parliament, February 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An anti-Brexit demonstrator outside the Houses of Parliament, February 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I should have recognised the feeling sooner. It was a feeling I perceived intellectually, but didn\u2019t experience personally, when I talked to people in the former Soviet Union in the 1990s about their regret for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/jul/14/soviet-union-collapse-in-pictures\" title=\"\">collapse of the USSR</a> \u2013 its economic collapse bound together with the belittlement and dissolution of its cultural landscape.</p> <p>It\u2019s a feeling, I imagine, very similar to learning that the mine or factory where you and your family have worked for a generation or two is closing, or that new people who look and talk and dress differently to your people are eligible for benefits you\u2019ve been queueing for, or that the social values that defined your youth are now officially wrong \u2013 which means, by extension, that your youth was wrong, too. And now we remainers were feeling it: people like me, who had remotely observed others, were experiencing it for ourselves. For leavers, the merit of voting to leave the EU wasn\u2019t only in winning. It was in getting their opponents to feel loss \u2013 to feel what they had felt, that deep unease at the shattering of their representation of the world. My bad feeling was somebody else\u2019s catharsis.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been angry about Brexit. I\u2019ve been ashamed, sometimes fearful, often bored by the futility and pettiness of it all. As I write, although the fight goes on for a second-thoughts referendum, it seems likely Britain won\u2019t be in the European Union by year\u2019s end \u2013 perhaps as soon as the end of next month \u2013 and I\u2019ll be angry, ashamed and fearful again. These feelings are forgivable. What isn\u2019t forgivable, however, is bitterness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a059a9ccbfe10eae9b43831bcc711ac935b2c544\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a059a9ccbfe10eae9b43831bcc711ac935b2c544/0_0_1280_1920/667.jpg\" alt=\"Leave protestors at Downing Street, November 2018.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leave protestors at Downing Street, November 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If and when Brexit happens, I don\u2019t want to be a remainer equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/11/usa.julianborger1\" title=\"\">Rush Limbaugh</a>, uttering his odious response to Barack Obama\u2019s election as US president: \u201cI hope he fails.\u201d While it will be hard to forgive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gallery/2018/oct/20/peoples-vote-march-brexit-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson his lies</a>, or David Cameron his haughty recklessness, while I\u2019ll always struggle to see Nigel Farage as anything other than the outcome of a liaison between Toad of Toad Hall and the Chief Weasel, I don\u2019t want my dislike of the leavers\u2019 champions hardening into a crude ideology of hatred. To fume for ever at the tricks and strength of the winners, without questioning my own, British liberal way of thinking, would be to waste one of the few opportunities Brexit offers.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that the country should put aside its differences and come together: a horrible, stifling thought. It often seems, in the heat of Brexit rage, that ardent leavers and remainers have forgotten how normal it is for nations to be divided. \u201cUnited\u201d nations made up of people who agree about everything are fictions invented by authoritarian regimes. The point of democracies is not to unite a nation so that everyone is happy, but to manage the unhappiness of whoever feels they\u2019ve lost out without resorting to civil war.</p> <p>A renunciation of bitterness doesn\u2019t mean remainers giving up their struggle, either, reining in their attacks on folly and social media jiggery-pokery. It means remainers like me examining and beginning to resolve the contradictions in our own, not always rational, way of representing the world. We need to raise our eyes from Brexit and consider not just the Britain, not just the Europe, but the kind of world we are aiming for. The alternative is to end up as the remainer version of a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/03/india.france\" title=\"\"> French Bourbon </a>aristocrat, learning nothing, forgetting nothing.</p> <p>Who are we, the remainers? We know what we don\u2019t want, but we don\u2019t seem sure what we do want in the long term. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/matthew-goodwin\" title=\"\">Matthew Goodwin</a>, an academic and writer prominent in analysis of the deep roots of English Euroscepticism, has characterised Britain\u2019s current political landscape as the embodiment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/17/tony-abbott-the-lonely-nihilist-has-one-last-lesson-for-us\" title=\"\">Michael Oakeshott</a>\u2019s distinction between \u201cpolitics as faith\u201d and \u201cpolitics as scepticism\u201d, moderated by the political scientist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/22/populism-concept-defines-our-age\" title=\"\">Margaret Canovan</a>\u2019s more optimistic version: she saw populism as pragmatic democracy\u2019s necessary redemptive shadow.</p> <p>The trouble with this is that it puts all the faith and redemptive hope, all the inspiration, all the archetypes of surrogate religion, all the dreaming, on the leave side, stranding the remainers in a dreamless, materialist Britain of cold calculation and joyless efficiency.</p> <p>Besides being offensive to remainers, it\u2019s inaccurate. Sure, the enlightened self-interest is there. But when the reality of EU administration is often so bumbling, awkward and lame, when the great majority of remain voters will never actually exercise the freedom to live and work on mainland Europe, isn\u2019t there something irrational and romantic about the yearning to continue to be \u201cpart of Europe\u201d \u2013 an act of faith, a response to impulses in one\u2019s political unconscious?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>This is the liberal bourgeois dilemma: an irreconcilable desire for both universality and particularity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I try to interrogate my own inclinations honestly, I find not only rational, pragmatic fears of Brexit, not only the personal legacy of past trans-European love affairs and a brother with a German wife living in Berlin, but a more intangible and perhaps not altogether wholesome dream of power and abandonment. This is the dream of being at once an element in a vast, variegated, rich continent, and of losing myself in wanderings in the furthest and least fashionable corners of that continent. It does not seem either rational or pragmatic, but nor is it \u201cwrong\u201d.</p> <p>Remainers, on the whole, aspire to a morality that is universal. We are liberals. We endorse the principle of the right to cultural self-determination not just for the native English, but for all peoples. At the same time we support other abstract, universal principles \u2013 women\u2019s rights, sexual minority rights, ethnic minority rights, animal rights, children\u2019s rights, the primacy of environmental protection, migrant rights, equal opportunities, education for all, democracy. Some liberals believe in free trade, free movement of people or free movement of capital.</p> <p>I have to face the truth that these strands are deeply contradictory. A belief in the imperative to conserve the traditional, authentic and distinctive in local cultures clashes with an equally fervent promotion of universal rights and freedoms. This is the liberal bourgeois dilemma: an irreconcilable desire for both universality and particularity.</p> <p>British liberals both supported large-scale coal mining as the enabler of traditional, authentic, working-class communities, and abominated it as global warming\u2019s lead culprit. Only an accident of history allowed these sentiments to be consecutive, rather than concurrent. Liberals prize the authentically local, the person or product or way of being that is truly, traditionally, of place; we are sad and angry when that authenticity is cheapened, commercialised, tainted by globalism, even though our own restless, flocking quest for local authenticity in multiple locations each year contributes to the very globalism that torments us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c4fea4838ec4ff2b05903007381a7533ceacf5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c4fea4838ec4ff2b05903007381a7533ceacf5a/0_196_6435_3861/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The trickiest contradiction in the remainer-liberal view is the European Union itself.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The trickiest contradiction in the remainer-liberal view is the European Union itself.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thierry Monasse/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And there are consequences. At the libertarian, neoliberal end of liberalism, there are occasional personal shocks for those whose wealth usually enables them to keep the contradictions at a distance. A friend who prospered as a fund manager in London stepped back from finance and became involved in a worthy British charity helping to empower young people. On her way to a meeting of the organisation in a northern English town, the taxi driver began telling her of the area\u2019s economic woes and she realised the multinational responsible for hurting the people she was trying to help was one of the companies she\u2019d invested her clients\u2019 money in.</p> <p>At the communitarian end \u2013 the part of the liberal spectrum where I like to think I reside \u2013 there\u2019s a tendency to assume \u201cgood\u201d localism (the ideal of the \u201cthriving local community\u201d, locally sourced food, preservation of vernacular local architecture and the traditional local landscape) can be neatly separated from \u201cbad\u201d localism (hostility to immigrants and new ways of doing things). But can it? </p> <p>The trickiest contradiction in the remainer-liberal view is the European Union itself. British liberals like to see support for remaining in the EU as a marker, of and by itself, of good universal values: openness, receptiveness to other cultures and ideas, freedom for people to move and work in different places, widely pooled security. Indeed, Britain in the EU does approach these values more nearly than Britain on its own. But they aren\u2019t applied universally. Britain, on its own, is an exclusionary, overwhelmingly white, post-Christian society; Britain in the EU is part of a larger, overwhelmingly white, post-Christian society that still excludes 14 out of 15 of the world\u2019s population from freely moving, living or working there.</p> <p>In the wake of the Brexit vote a number of EU citizens living in Britain have had horrible experiences with the immigration authorities. But the experiences of the Windrush generation, people who have lived in Britain for decades and find themselves officially persecuted, in some cases forcibly expelled to countries they were brought from as children, happened while Britain was still in the EU. Two hundred people a month are dying trying to illegally cross the EU\u2019s closed external borders.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The idea that remain voters were winners who only cared about themselves and leave voters were losers is simplistic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most remainers I know feel it\u2019s a strong enough stance on openness to be firm in their insistence on free movement within Europe, firm on the rights of migrants and refugees, and vague on the ideal degree of permeability of the external borders of the jurisdiction in which they live. There aren\u2019t many takers for absolute global freedom of movement. But to spell out the exact nature and justification of the consequent limits to absolute freedom provokes in liberals a fear of infection with the disease of racial exclusivity. The shudders that greeted<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/30/brown-british-jobs-workers\" title=\"\"> Gordon Brown\u2019s \u201cBritish jobs for British workers\u201d</a> comment, or Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s complaint of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/30/labour-immigration-u-turn-corbyn\" title=\"\">wholesale importation of underpaid workers from central Europe</a>\u201d, are proof enough.</p> <p>\u00b6</p> <p>The idea that remain voters were winners who only cared about themselves and leave voters were losers screaming for help is simplistic. Most remain voters don\u2019t deny the damage the country has suffered since the crash of 2008, if not earlier.</p> <p>The damage is economic and cultural. Economically, high-status non-graduate jobs with good pay and conditions have been replaced by low-status jobs with bad pay and conditions, housing has become scarcer and more expensive, taxpayer-funded public services such as health, education, police and the criminal justice system have got worse, and privatised user-funded public services such as water and energy have increased in cost to the benefit of their mainly overseas owners. Culturally, distinctiveness of place is being erased by a creeping uniformity whose paradoxical hallmark is a shallow diversity. In a narrow sense the blame for these ills is distributed differently; one side blames immigration and the EU, the other, austerity and globalisation.</p> <p>Both halves of the electorate, then, are dismayed by the same phenomena \u2013 economic decay and corrosion of identity. To see a relationship between hostility to immigrants from far away (which shades into overt racism) and hostility to capitalists from far away is not to equate them, but to acknowledge the coincidence of mood. In the same way, the blaming of immigrants and the blaming of government spending cuts are two quite different responses to the strain on public services, but they meet at the heart of the problem, which is that British government spending is not increasing at the same pace as the population of Britain. Taking inflation and population into account, the British state now spends 6% less on public services than it did in 2010 \u2013 an absolute cut that most affects the poorest and the oldest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bb5534585c5297b4dfa3aaefc74ef2a73c1fab0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb5534585c5297b4dfa3aaefc74ef2a73c1fab0e/0_0_1825_2309/790.jpg\" alt=\"Applications for Irish passports jumped by 50% after the Brexit vote.\" width=\"790\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Applications for Irish passports jumped by 50% after the Brexit vote.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes since the Brexit referendum I\u2019ve sensed the divergent dreams of leavers and remainers reducing to the same primal personal desire, the desire to live in a community that is naturally, effortlessly kind to them and their families \u2013 one where a structural benignity of laws, customs and officialdom is matched by a social benignity of shared outlook and common values. Among some leavers floats a dream of Britain as an island purged of incomers \u2013 out with the Muslim, the Pole, the Russian oligarch and his dirty money. Remainers are haunted by a dream of sanctuary, of some other country marvellously preserving the spirit of a more generous and tolerant society, ready to make available for a select few Britons that freedom and openness of outlook Britain has lost for ever. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get an Irish passport.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m eligible for German citizenship.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to be spending more time at my house in Spain. This country\u2019s finished.\u201d</p> <p>When \u201cdream\u201d refers to your representation of the world, it\u2019s not a state you\u2019re going to wake from. The disruption to your dream comes otherwise; not only in the form of a momentous event like military defeat, imperial collapse, workplace disappearance or Brexit. It comes when you can\u2019t avoid awareness that your dream clashes with another\u2019s: when the remainer beds deeply in her new home abroad only to find that there, too, resentment of the outsider and the cosmopolitan runs deep, and she encounters local versions of the dark island dream of purification she fled. Where, now, in the world is a sanctuary for tolerance more reliable than the one you might get if you spoke up for the values you claim to hold in the place you already are? In a US where almost a hundred million adults think Donald Trump is doing a good job? In a France where a third of the electorate wanted the virulently anti-immigrant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/26/marine-le-pen-french-euroscepticism\" title=\"\">Eurosceptic Marine Le Pen</a> as president? In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/12/denmark-official-ghettos-cultural-assimilation-country-once-tolerant\" title=\"\">Denmark which is establishing immigrant ghettos</a> where different laws apply?</p> <p>For the leavers and their island dream, it\u2019s harsher. They know their exclusionary dream clashes with the sanctuary-seeking dream of immigrants and refugees from other countries \u2013 people who yearn not just for better-paid work than at home but for a refuge from corruption and extreme pro-rich policies that render basic public services in their countries weak, patchy or non-existent.</p> <p>\u00b6</p> <p>Whatever course the Brexit process now takes, the future for those who believe themselves tolerant and outward-looking, but who resist Britain\u2019s economic and cultural corrosion, must be to continually challenge acceptance of a world where the division of the spoils of labour varies so wildly from one country to the next. The failed liberal slogan for the world that sounded so loudly in the afterclap of communism\u2019s fall \u2013 \u201cDemocracy and the free market\u201d \u2013 lacks the Robin Hood kicker: democracy, trade and fairly shared wealth.</p> <p>The scale to measure the success of globalisation shouldn\u2019t be how easily the wealthiest can suck rents from the majority and keep the proceeds through a combination of capital mobility, tax havens and wage suppression, by shuffling production, populations and profits from national jurisdiction to national jurisdiction. It should be by how far the world as a whole approaches a high baseline of shared security and prosperity, within which cultural distinctiveness can flourish \u2013 how far Indonesia or China or Egypt are reaching up to establish universal networks such as education, healthcare, housing, water and energy supply; how far Britain, the United States or Italy are levelling down; and where the levels meet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>If a poor country reneges on its commitment to open markets it will be hung out to dry by the global financial system</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the world is, if a country reneges on the trappings of democracy, doesn\u2019t hold free elections, arrests and tortures dissenters, crushes minorities, starts invading its neighbours and smothers free speech, it can expect, at the minimum, odium from the global human rights establishment, at worst sanctions, even (if it\u2019s small and weak) military action. Similarly, if a poor country reneges on its commitment to open markets and trade, it will be hung out to dry by the global financial system.</p> <p>No similar set of responses, not even a conceptual framework, exists by which intensively networked societies such as Britain or Japan \u2013 countries, that is, that have universal networks of health, education, welfare and so on, built and maintained on the basis of wealth shared through taxation \u2013 might pressurise the wealthy elite of other nations to share more of their wealth with the mass of their own people. If sanctions are the weapons of global democracy, and capital flight the weapon of global finance, what might the weapon of global social justice be?

      "bodyText": "I was living in Norwich when the Brexit referendum happened. The city voted remain, an island of European feeling separated from Cambridge \u2013 the next dot in the remainer archipelago \u2013 by 60 miles of rural and small town leaverdom. One morning not long afterwards, in the small hours, a local deli selling Romanian produce was firebombed. No one was hurt, although people were sleeping in a flat over the shop when it happened. A crowdfunding appeal quickly raised almost \u00a330,000 for the damaged business. A few days later I went with my infant son to a rally for tolerance held in the market square in response to the attack. The numbers were pitifully few. I remember looking round at my fellow demonstrators, the elderly liberals and the hippies, and thinking none of us would be much good in a street fight. Tolerance was all very well, but what if we had to defend ourselves? My psychic response to the leaver neurosis of remainers as \u201cthe arrogant elite\u201d was an equally neurotic identification with the persecuted of history, as if the 52% were about to systematically Other and repress the 48% en masse. It was a jittery and unsettling time. I doubt I was alone among remain voters in feeling, for the first week or two after the referendum, that sleep-reducing ball of anxiety in the pit of my stomach which signifies the perception not just that a deeply wrong event has occurred, but that the very framework within which events of any kind occur has been broken. I should have recognised the feeling sooner. It was a feeling I perceived intellectually, but didn\u2019t experience personally, when I talked to people in the former Soviet Union in the 1990s about their regret for the collapse of the USSR \u2013 its economic collapse bound together with the belittlement and dissolution of its cultural landscape. It\u2019s a feeling, I imagine, very similar to learning that the mine or factory where you and your family have worked for a generation or two is closing, or that new people who look and talk and dress differently to your people are eligible for benefits you\u2019ve been queueing for, or that the social values that defined your youth are now officially wrong \u2013 which means, by extension, that your youth was wrong, too. And now we remainers were feeling it: people like me, who had remotely observed others, were experiencing it for ourselves. For leavers, the merit of voting to leave the EU wasn\u2019t only in winning. It was in getting their opponents to feel loss \u2013 to feel what they had felt, that deep unease at the shattering of their representation of the world. My bad feeling was somebody else\u2019s catharsis. I\u2019ve been angry about Brexit. I\u2019ve been ashamed, sometimes fearful, often bored by the futility and pettiness of it all. As I write, although the fight goes on for a second-thoughts referendum, it seems likely Britain won\u2019t be in the European Union by year\u2019s end \u2013 perhaps as soon as the end of next month \u2013 and I\u2019ll be angry, ashamed and fearful again. These feelings are forgivable. What isn\u2019t forgivable, however, is bitterness. If and when Brexit happens, I don\u2019t want to be a remainer equivalent of Rush Limbaugh, uttering his odious response to Barack Obama\u2019s election as US president: \u201cI hope he fails.\u201d While it will be hard to forgive Boris Johnson his lies, or David Cameron his haughty recklessness, while I\u2019ll always struggle to see Nigel Farage as anything other than the outcome of a liaison between Toad of Toad Hall and the Chief Weasel, I don\u2019t want my dislike of the leavers\u2019 champions hardening into a crude ideology of hatred. To fume for ever at the tricks and strength of the winners, without questioning my own, British liberal way of thinking, would be to waste one of the few opportunities Brexit offers. It\u2019s not that the country should put aside its differences and come together: a horrible, stifling thought. It often seems, in the heat of Brexit rage, that ardent leavers and remainers have forgotten how normal it is for nations to be divided. \u201cUnited\u201d nations made up of people who agree about everything are fictions invented by authoritarian regimes. The point of democracies is not to unite a nation so that everyone is happy, but to manage the unhappiness of whoever feels they\u2019ve lost out without resorting to civil war. A renunciation of bitterness doesn\u2019t mean remainers giving up their struggle, either, reining in their attacks on folly and social media jiggery-pokery. It means remainers like me examining and beginning to resolve the contradictions in our own, not always rational, way of representing the world. We need to raise our eyes from Brexit and consider not just the Britain, not just the Europe, but the kind of world we are aiming for. The alternative is to end up as the remainer version of a French Bourbon aristocrat, learning nothing, forgetting nothing. Who are we, the remainers? We know what we don\u2019t want, but we don\u2019t seem sure what we do want in the long term. Matthew Goodwin, an academic and writer prominent in analysis of the deep roots of English Euroscepticism, has characterised Britain\u2019s current political landscape as the embodiment of Michael Oakeshott\u2019s distinction between \u201cpolitics as faith\u201d and \u201cpolitics as scepticism\u201d, moderated by the political scientist Margaret Canovan\u2019s more optimistic version: she saw populism as pragmatic democracy\u2019s necessary redemptive shadow. The trouble with this is that it puts all the faith and redemptive hope, all the inspiration, all the archetypes of surrogate religion, all the dreaming, on the leave side, stranding the remainers in a dreamless, materialist Britain of cold calculation and joyless efficiency. Besides being offensive to remainers, it\u2019s inaccurate. Sure, the enlightened self-interest is there. But when the reality of EU administration is often so bumbling, awkward and lame, when the great majority of remain voters will never actually exercise the freedom to live and work on mainland Europe, isn\u2019t there something irrational and romantic about the yearning to continue to be \u201cpart of Europe\u201d \u2013 an act of faith, a response to impulses in one\u2019s political unconscious? When I try to interrogate my own inclinations honestly, I find not only rational, pragmatic fears of Brexit, not only the personal legacy of past trans-European love affairs and a brother with a German wife living in Berlin, but a more intangible and perhaps not altogether wholesome dream of power and abandonment. This is the dream of being at once an element in a vast, variegated, rich continent, and of losing myself in wanderings in the furthest and least fashionable corners of that continent. It does not seem either rational or pragmatic, but nor is it \u201cwrong\u201d. Remainers, on the whole, aspire to a morality that is universal. We are liberals. We endorse the principle of the right to cultural self-determination not just for the native English, but for all peoples. At the same time we support other abstract, universal principles \u2013 women\u2019s rights, sexual minority rights, ethnic minority rights, animal rights, children\u2019s rights, the primacy of environmental protection, migrant rights, equal opportunities, education for all, democracy. Some liberals believe in free trade, free movement of people or free movement of capital. I have to face the truth that these strands are deeply contradictory. A belief in the imperative to conserve the traditional, authentic and distinctive in local cultures clashes with an equally fervent promotion of universal rights and freedoms. This is the liberal bourgeois dilemma: an irreconcilable desire for both universality and particularity. British liberals both supported large-scale coal mining as the enabler of traditional, authentic, working-class communities, and abominated it as global warming\u2019s lead culprit. Only an accident of history allowed these sentiments to be consecutive, rather than concurrent. Liberals prize the authentically local, the person or product or way of being that is truly, traditionally, of place; we are sad and angry when that authenticity is cheapened, commercialised, tainted by globalism, even though our own restless, flocking quest for local authenticity in multiple locations each year contributes to the very globalism that torments us. And there are consequences. At the libertarian, neoliberal end of liberalism, there are occasional personal shocks for those whose wealth usually enables them to keep the contradictions at a distance. A friend who prospered as a fund manager in London stepped back from finance and became involved in a worthy British charity helping to empower young people. On her way to a meeting of the organisation in a northern English town, the taxi driver began telling her of the area\u2019s economic woes and she realised the multinational responsible for hurting the people she was trying to help was one of the companies she\u2019d invested her clients\u2019 money in. At the communitarian end \u2013 the part of the liberal spectrum where I like to think I reside \u2013 there\u2019s a tendency to assume \u201cgood\u201d localism (the ideal of the \u201cthriving local community\u201d, locally sourced food, preservation of vernacular local architecture and the traditional local landscape) can be neatly separated from \u201cbad\u201d localism (hostility to immigrants and new ways of doing things). But can it? The trickiest contradiction in the remainer-liberal view is the European Union itself. British liberals like to see support for remaining in the EU as a marker, of and by itself, of good universal values: openness, receptiveness to other cultures and ideas, freedom for people to move and work in different places, widely pooled security. Indeed, Britain in the EU does approach these values more nearly than Britain on its own. But they aren\u2019t applied universally. Britain, on its own, is an exclusionary, overwhelmingly white, post-Christian society; Britain in the EU is part of a larger, overwhelmingly white, post-Christian society that still excludes 14 out of 15 of the world\u2019s population from freely moving, living or working there. In the wake of the Brexit vote a number of EU citizens living in Britain have had horrible experiences with the immigration authorities. But the experiences of the Windrush generation, people who have lived in Britain for decades and find themselves officially persecuted, in some cases forcibly expelled to countries they were brought from as children, happened while Britain was still in the EU. Two hundred people a month are dying trying to illegally cross the EU\u2019s closed external borders. Most remainers I know feel it\u2019s a strong enough stance on openness to be firm in their insistence on free movement within Europe, firm on the rights of migrants and refugees, and vague on the ideal degree of permeability of the external borders of the jurisdiction in which they live. There aren\u2019t many takers for absolute global freedom of movement. But to spell out the exact nature and justification of the consequent limits to absolute freedom provokes in liberals a fear of infection with the disease of racial exclusivity. The shudders that greeted Gordon Brown\u2019s \u201cBritish jobs for British workers\u201d comment, or Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s complaint of \u201cwholesale importation of underpaid workers from central Europe\u201d, are proof enough. \u00b6 The idea that remain voters were winners who only cared about themselves and leave voters were losers screaming for help is simplistic. Most remain voters don\u2019t deny the damage the country has suffered since the crash of 2008, if not earlier. The damage is economic and cultural. Economically, high-status non-graduate jobs with good pay and conditions have been replaced by low-status jobs with bad pay and conditions, housing has become scarcer and more expensive, taxpayer-funded public services such as health, education, police and the criminal justice system have got worse, and privatised user-funded public services such as water and energy have increased in cost to the benefit of their mainly overseas owners. Culturally, distinctiveness of place is being erased by a creeping uniformity whose paradoxical hallmark is a shallow diversity. In a narrow sense the blame for these ills is distributed differently; one side blames immigration and the EU, the other, austerity and globalisation. Both halves of the electorate, then, are dismayed by the same phenomena \u2013 economic decay and corrosion of identity. To see a relationship between hostility to immigrants from far away (which shades into overt racism) and hostility to capitalists from far away is not to equate them, but to acknowledge the coincidence of mood. In the same way, the blaming of immigrants and the blaming of government spending cuts are two quite different responses to the strain on public services, but they meet at the heart of the problem, which is that British government spending is not increasing at the same pace as the population of Britain. Taking inflation and population into account, the British state now spends 6% less on public services than it did in 2010 \u2013 an absolute cut that most affects the poorest and the oldest. Sometimes since the Brexit referendum I\u2019ve sensed the divergent dreams of leavers and remainers reducing to the same primal personal desire, the desire to live in a community that is naturally, effortlessly kind to them and their families \u2013 one where a structural benignity of laws, customs and officialdom is matched by a social benignity of shared outlook and common values. Among some leavers floats a dream of Britain as an island purged of incomers \u2013 out with the Muslim, the Pole, the Russian oligarch and his dirty money. Remainers are haunted by a dream of sanctuary, of some other country marvellously preserving the spirit of a more generous and tolerant society, ready to make available for a select few Britons that freedom and openness of outlook Britain has lost for ever. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get an Irish passport.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m eligible for German citizenship.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to be spending more time at my house in Spain. This country\u2019s finished.\u201d When \u201cdream\u201d refers to your representation of the world, it\u2019s not a state you\u2019re going to wake from. The disruption to your dream comes otherwise; not only in the form of a momentous event like military defeat, imperial collapse, workplace disappearance or Brexit. It comes when you can\u2019t avoid awareness that your dream clashes with another\u2019s: when the remainer beds deeply in her new home abroad only to find that there, too, resentment of the outsider and the cosmopolitan runs deep, and she encounters local versions of the dark island dream of purification she fled. Where, now, in the world is a sanctuary for tolerance more reliable than the one you might get if you spoke up for the values you claim to hold in the place you already are? In a US where almost a hundred million adults think Donald Trump is doing a good job? In a France where a third of the electorate wanted the virulently anti-immigrant Eurosceptic Marine Le Pen as president? In a Denmark which is establishing immigrant ghettos where different laws apply? For the leavers and their island dream, it\u2019s harsher. They know their exclusionary dream clashes with the sanctuary-seeking dream of immigrants and refugees from other countries \u2013 people who yearn not just for better-paid work than at home but for a refuge from corruption and extreme pro-rich policies that render basic public services in their countries weak, patchy or non-existent. \u00b6 Whatever course the Brexit process now takes, the future for those who believe themselves tolerant and outward-looking, but who resist Britain\u2019s economic and cultural corrosion, must be to continually challenge acceptance of a world where the division of the spoils of labour varies so wildly from one country to the next. The failed liberal slogan for the world that sounded so loudly in the afterclap of communism\u2019s fall \u2013 \u201cDemocracy and the free market\u201d \u2013 lacks the Robin Hood kicker: democracy, trade and fairly shared wealth. The scale to measure the success of globalisation shouldn\u2019t be how easily the wealthiest can suck rents from the majority and keep the proceeds through a combination of capital mobility, tax havens and wage suppression, by shuffling production, populations and profits from national jurisdiction to national jurisdiction. It should be by how far the world as a whole approaches a high baseline of shared security and prosperity, within which cultural distinctiveness can flourish \u2013 how far Indonesia or China or Egypt are reaching up to establish universal networks such as education, healthcare, housing, water and energy supply; how far Britain, the United States or Italy are levelling down; and where the levels meet. As the world is, if a country reneges on the trappings of democracy, doesn\u2019t hold free elections, arrests and tortures dissenters, crushes minorities, starts invading its neighbours and smothers free speech, it can expect, at the minimum, odium from the global human rights establishment, at worst sanctions, even (if it\u2019s small and weak) military action. Similarly, if a poor country reneges on its commitment to open markets and trade, it will be hung out to dry by the global financial system. No similar set of responses, not even a conceptual framework, exists by which intensively networked societies such as Britain or Japan \u2013 countries, that is, that have universal networks of health, education, welfare and so on, built and maintained on the basis of wealth shared through taxation \u2013 might pressurise the wealthy elite of other nations to share more of their wealth with the mass of their own people. If sanctions are the weapons of global democracy, and capital flight the weapon of global finance, what might the weapon of global social justice be? Perhaps a global wealth tax; perhaps something like tariffs, tied to a global minimum wage. This doesn\u2019t sound terribly exciting, until you think about the consequences, and reflect on where we in Britain might be now if, before the former communist countries of eastern Europe joined the EU, Brussels had brought in a Europe-wide minimum wage, pegged to west European living standards. As we prepare to leave the EU, the discourse of the most prominent Brexiters, who are almost all Conservatives, is thick with neo-imperialist gobbledygook about global trade. Their opponents, scattered through the parties, must not think on a smaller scale.

      "bodyText": "Bernardo Silva\u2019s status with Pep Guardiola is clear. \u201cI love him,\u201d says Manchester City\u2019s manager, who last month warned Kevin De Bruyne that while injured he had lost his place to the Portuguese. To inform City\u2019s best player of last season that he has a fight to be selected over Silva illustrates just how good the Lisbon-born playmaker has been. At 24 Silva is the future and present of City, a player Guardiola can play in at least four positions. Silva has actually operated in five: as a winger, wing-back, central midfielder, false No 9 and trequartista, which his manager views as Silva\u2019s best position. It is unclear where he will be deployed for Sunday\u2019s Carabao Cup final against Chelsea. \u201cI think as a No 10 behind the striker [is his natural game] but as a winger he can move inside, stay wide, he can play in all positions in the middle, attacking positions \u2013 he can play three or four positions,\u201d Guardiola says. Guardiola points to Silva\u2019s personality as being as much of a revelation as his play, with this reflected in the smile and time the former Monaco player has for the media, often stopping to talk after a game. \u201cHe knows when he doesn\u2019t play good,\u201d says his manager. \u201cBut he\u2019s nearly always an eight or a nine. You cannot play every single game every three days at the top level but he runs and runs. Maybe this season he\u2019s been one or two of the best players in the Premier League. \u201cLook at how he celebrates the goals with his teammates; he\u2019s a joy,\u201d continued Guardiola. \u201cI\u2019m an incredibly lucky guy to have him in my hands. He enjoys every training session and game. Portugal is fortunate to have him \u2013 the manager will use him every game. I love him, it\u2019s simple like that.\u201d Guardiola has cited how Silva does not \u201cpull a face\u201d if not selected. Along with De Bruyne, he is also competing with David Silva, Fernandinho, Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, Riyad Mahrez, Raheem Sterling and Leroy San\u00e9, and the player\u2019s own perspective on the battle for a starting berth mirrors that of the manager. Silva says: \u201cI think all of us work very hard to try and play as much as possible. We know it is not easy sometimes because the squad has fantastic players and we just push each other to try and get better and at the end of it Pep decides and we have to accept his decisions.\u201d For Portugal Silva now outshines Cristiano Ronaldo, according to Guardiola. Asked whether Silva is Portugal\u2019s next big star, the City manager is unequivocal. \u201cHe\u2019s the biggest star already,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s a lovely person. I love to work with him \u2013 he always has a big smile. The most beloved in the locker room, he has everything, one of the most talented players I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Silva\u2019s numbers back Guardiola\u2019s stance. De Bruyne\u2019s season has been blighted by two serious knee injuries but Silva\u2019s form means his absence has been felt far less than it might. He has featured in all but one of City\u2019s league games this season, his 2,075 minutes second only to Fernandinho\u2019s 2,173. The 47 chances engineered are only two behind David Silva and Bernardo\u2019s 281.9km (175.1 miles) covered is the highest by far of his central midfield cohorts; Fernandinho is next with 259.8km (164.3 miles). As Guardiola\u2019s arch-destroyer Fernandinho\u2019s 52 tackles can be expected to be the highest but Bernardo Silva\u2019s 35 are nearly twice as many as David Silva\u2019s 19, and the Portuguese has five goals compared with the Spaniard\u2019s six. David Silva was 33 last month and Guardiola has started to rest him occasionally. Bernardo\u2019s emergence into a major force solves the headache of who can replace the Spaniard when his powers finally wane.",

      "body": "<p>The toll booths were removed from the Severn Bridge two months ago but granting a free ride to English rugby teams in Cardiff will never catch on. It explains why the Six Nations retains its passion and lustre, in defiance of societal changes and Britain\u2019s shifting political sands. The desire to make England pay for the perceived crime of being English is always strongest on days like this, regardless of the championship table.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/22/england-back-row\">Eddie Jones finds a back-row trio who are singing from same song sheet | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To describe it as just another game of rugby also blithely ignores history, both ancient and modern. Wales are unbeaten in their last 11 Tests while England, having re-found their attacking mojo with 10 tries against Ireland and France, have not felt so buoyant in some time. In the event of Principality Stadium success, both sides will fancy completing a grand slam. There has not been a more eagerly-anticipated Gavin and Stacey \u201cderby\u201d since the 2015 Rugby World Cup.</p> <p>England had high hopes of winning on that dramatic day, as they did in 2013 before Wales stormed home 30-3. If recent results have tipped more in England\u2019s favour, the margins have been slender: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/10/england-wales-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">Sam Underhill\u2019s match-saving tackle on Scott Williams</a> proved the difference last year and Elliot Daly\u2019s 76th-minute try swung the last meeting in Cardiff in 2017. Wales could easily have won both matches with slightly more luck and composure.</p> <p>There are few reasons to imagine Wales folding meekly this time either. Partly that is because they never do in Cardiff under Warren Gatland and Shaun Edwards, both of whom will be moving on at the end of this year. In the shape of Alun Wyn Jones, Ken Owens, Justin Tipuric, Jonathan Davies, George North and Liam Williams they also possess half a dozen gnarled Lions who know precisely what mindset these huge contests demand. Ignore Wales\u2019s moderate form in their opening two away wins against France and Italy; they are very different beasts at home.</p> <p>There is also an argument that England have been almost too good so far this month and, as a result, have scarcely been tested in certain key areas. Cutting a feeble-minded France to ribbons with superfast ball and smart tactical kicking is one thing but neither Ireland nor <em>Les Bleus</em> put them under any great stress beneath the high ball nor asked many sustained attacking questions.</p> <p>Wales have certainly picked a team to go at England, with the two Gareths \u2013 Davies and Anscombe \u2013 offering pace and initiative at half-back. Add in a smart midfield and plenty of nuisance value at the breakdown and the hosts are equipped, at least in theory, to examine how comfortable England are on the back foot. Without Mako Vunipola and Maro Itoje, there are two fewer world-class opponents with whom to grapple and Jonathan Joseph, a persistent thorn in Welsh sides, is not around either.</p> <p>Then there is the South African referee, Jaco Peyper, last seen opting not to penalise Owen Farrell for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/25/eddie-jones-owen-farrell-england-australia-tackle-autumn-internationals\" title=\"\">no-arms shoulder hit on Wallaby forward Izack Rodda</a> at Twickenham in November.</p> <p>Farrell has been on best behaviour since the turn of the year but the massed Welsh choirs inside the Principality Stadium can be relied upon to make a lot of noise should he tackle a home player even fractionally north of the belly button. So much of what England are now about revolves around Farrell, yet to put a toenail wrong this month.

      "bodyText": "The toll booths were removed from the Severn Bridge two months ago but granting a free ride to English rugby teams in Cardiff will never catch on. It explains why the Six Nations retains its passion and lustre, in defiance of societal changes and Britain\u2019s shifting political sands. The desire to make England pay for the perceived crime of being English is always strongest on days like this, regardless of the championship table. To describe it as just another game of rugby also blithely ignores history, both ancient and modern. Wales are unbeaten in their last 11 Tests while England, having re-found their attacking mojo with 10 tries against Ireland and France, have not felt so buoyant in some time. In the event of Principality Stadium success, both sides will fancy completing a grand slam. There has not been a more eagerly-anticipated Gavin and Stacey \u201cderby\u201d since the 2015 Rugby World Cup. England had high hopes of winning on that dramatic day, as they did in 2013 before Wales stormed home 30-3. If recent results have tipped more in England\u2019s favour, the margins have been slender: Sam Underhill\u2019s match-saving tackle on Scott Williams proved the difference last year and Elliot Daly\u2019s 76th-minute try swung the last meeting in Cardiff in 2017. Wales could easily have won both matches with slightly more luck and composure. There are few reasons to imagine Wales folding meekly this time either. Partly that is because they never do in Cardiff under Warren Gatland and Shaun Edwards, both of whom will be moving on at the end of this year. In the shape of Alun Wyn Jones, Ken Owens, Justin Tipuric, Jonathan Davies, George North and Liam Williams they also possess half a dozen gnarled Lions who know precisely what mindset these huge contests demand. Ignore Wales\u2019s moderate form in their opening two away wins against France and Italy; they are very different beasts at home. There is also an argument that England have been almost too good so far this month and, as a result, have scarcely been tested in certain key areas. Cutting a feeble-minded France to ribbons with superfast ball and smart tactical kicking is one thing but neither Ireland nor Les Bleus put them under any great stress beneath the high ball nor asked many sustained attacking questions. Wales have certainly picked a team to go at England, with the two Gareths \u2013 Davies and Anscombe \u2013 offering pace and initiative at half-back. Add in a smart midfield and plenty of nuisance value at the breakdown and the hosts are equipped, at least in theory, to examine how comfortable England are on the back foot. Without Mako Vunipola and Maro Itoje, there are two fewer world-class opponents with whom to grapple and Jonathan Joseph, a persistent thorn in Welsh sides, is not around either. Then there is the South African referee, Jaco Peyper, last seen opting not to penalise Owen Farrell for a no-arms shoulder hit on Wallaby forward Izack Rodda at Twickenham in November. Farrell has been on best behaviour since the turn of the year but the massed Welsh choirs inside the Principality Stadium can be relied upon to make a lot of noise should he tackle a home player even fractionally north of the belly button. So much of what England are now about revolves around Farrell, yet to put a toenail wrong this month. If anyone exemplifies England\u2019s rebooted attitude over the past few months it is their fly-half, captain and head-tilting goalkicker; few are still talking about the critical absence of Dylan Hartley\u2019s leadership skills. Since Farrell has taken up residence at No 10 with a well-balanced centre pairing outside him, it is as if a mental handbrake has been released on England\u2019s previously spluttering chariot. If they are beaten in Cardiff, fair enough, but fear of the big occasion will not be the cause. This England clearly believe that, having won 32-20 in Dublin and scored four tries in doing so, they can win anywhere. Not that Farrell is exuding even a flicker of arrogance on the eve of his side\u2019s last big competitive away day before they head to the World Cup in Japan in September. To his eyes England still have a good distance to travel, their evolution far from over. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are anywhere near where we want to be. Everyone has talked over the past two weeks about our kicking game and what that has created. Your kicking game is only effective if there is space. And that space is only there if you are a threat with ball in hand.\u201d England\u2019s key objective, in short, will be to keep making the right tactical decisions about when and where to strike with maximum effect.

      "body": "<p>Since the publication of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/28/reality-hunger-book-review\" title=\"\"><em>Reality Hunger</em></a> in 2010, David Shields has been a busy man. Part of his argument in that book was that non-fiction is better adapted than fiction to address the realities of the modern world. And the volumes he has published in recent years have been an illustration of how resourceful and diverse non-fiction can be. But missing from Shields\u2019s Wikipedia entry is an as-told-to book composed in collaboration with his wife\u2019s cousin, <em>That Thing You Do With Your Mouth</em>, subtitled \u201cThe Sexual Autobiography of Samantha Matthews\u201d. In transcribing her story, Shields tells us, he hoped to satiate his interest in the subject of sex; instead it \u201conly sharpened my appetite to explore the matter further, in and for myself\u201d. <em>The Trouble With Men</em> is the sum of those further explorations.</p> <p>Sex, he says, has always been a major part of his life, even when he\u2019s not been having it. Indeed he\u2019s tempted to think that \u201csex is everything\u201d. Still, he has a particular reason for writing about it now. That\u2019s not because of #MeToo; the book\u2019s title may suggest a mea culpa on behalf of the gender but male predatoriness or abuse of power isn\u2019t the theme. And it\u2019s not merely driven by a wish to push the boundaries of candour (\u201cIt would be such a relief to be honest, for once\u201d). His motive is to start a conversation: \u201cThe only reason it\u2019s being written \u2026 is to talk, finally, to you.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cyou\u201d is his wife. Though he never names her, he talks to her throughout. The book is a test: not just the usual challenge of a memoir (how much frankness can the reader take?) but a more intimate one (will his wife ever forgive him?). He\u2019s willing, or at any rate impelled, to risk their marriage by opening it up to public scrutiny. They\u2019ve been together for many years. But she remains a mystery to him (\u201cI still don\u2019t know you at all\u201d) and even after all this time basic questions remain: \u201cDo I love you? Do you love me? What kind of marriage do we want? ... Do you love making love with me? (Don\u2019t answer.)\u201d His wife has been \u201cthe perfect muse, a ceaseless spur\u201d, not by nurturing his books but by failing to like them. That she\u2019s also against the idea of this one is an incentive: \u201cIt\u2019s so perfect that you don\u2019t want me to write this book (because you don\u2019t want to read it); therefore I have to write it. So, too, if you were fine with me writing it, I\u2019d have no desire to write it.\u201d</p> <p>If that sounds contrary, he\u2019s not apologising. Without contrariness there is no progression. Their marriage could have slid into senescent torpor by now, but opposition is keeping it alive. In their personalities and pursuits, he and his wife could hardly be more different but \u201cIf there were no difference, what would become of desire?\u201d The impression he leaves of her isn\u2019t flattering: \u201ca woman of icy temperament\u201d, domineering, Scottishly severe, more affectionate to their cat than to him, and singularly lacking in romance (she has no photos of him anywhere, whereas his of her are scattered all round his office). \u201cIn love there is always one who kisses and one who offers the cheek,\u201d and it\u2019s he who makes all the effort. \u201cHow did I get designated to \u2018work hard\u2019 in sex while you do nothing?\u201d he asks. Or \u201cWhy do all your favourite books about marriage include a dead spouse?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a child, Shields was taught to hate himself by his mother, 'a terrifying figure of Olympian hauteur and disdain'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His list of complaints might be read as a petition for divorce. In fact they\u2019re a kind of tribute or love letter: her mistreatment of him is exactly what he needs. She\u2019s subtly sadistic, he subtly masochistic, and that\u2019s why the marriage works. \u201cFemale indifference has always been incredibly erotic to me \u2026 Our sexual inclinations align.\u201d Not that he reveals what she\u2019s like, and what she likes, between the sheets. For all his candour, that would be a betrayal too far. In the best Rousseauesque tradition of confessionalism, the person most shamingly exposed is the author.</p> <p>As a child, Shields was taught to hate himself by his mother, \u201ca terrifying figure of Olympian hauteur and disdain\u201d; thereafter what he looked for in a woman was a \u201creservoir of coldness\u201d. He wasn\u2019t unpopular at school (a keen sportsman, he has never known happiness to equal that of playing basketball), but there were paranoid moments at the swimming pool lockers when the other boys seemed to be sniggering at the size of his penis (he\u2019d have liked to explain to them that he\u2019s a \u201cgrow-er not a show-er\u201d). Still a virgin at 19, he ruined things with his first girlfriend by admitting he\u2019d secretly read her diary entries about him. \u201cI\u2019m always the poor pup that loses,\u201d he concludes, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s drawn to the poor pups of literature, the self-harmers and self-destroyers. It\u2019s also what he wants from sex, to be humiliated: \u201cI need to believe you hate me and go to bed with me only because you have to \u2026 The only thing that\u2019s sexy to me is what hurts.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s brave of Shields to parade himself as cravenly as he does and he covers a lot of ground along the way: anal sex, oral sex, porn (\u201cthe world\u2019s one true religion\u201d), cross-dressing, scatological fixations, foot fetishism and so on. Not that he\u2019s into them all, but he\u2019s trying to solve the puzzle of who he is, \u201cto find out how in the world I got wired this way\u201d. His masochism is more than Jewish self-hatred. The best authors have it too: is there \u201cany \u2018major\u2019 modernist writer \u2013 Franz Kafka, Virginia Woolf, Proust, Thomas Mann, James Joyce, TS Eliot \u2013 who wasn\u2019t flagrantly masochistic?\u201d</p> <p>He even connects masochism to his habit of quoting authors without attribution. In <em>Reality Hunger</em> he defended it as a principled stand against copyright laws. Here he admits it was also \u201ca way to be \u2018bad\u2019 and get spanked\u201d.</p> <p>He won\u2019t get spanked this time. The basic method remains the same \u2013 his argument set out through a collage of thematically linked fragments, with him as both author and curator \u2013 but the writers he draws on are given their due in square brackets. He takes swipes at some of them: Norman Mailer \u201cand his insane theories about the rectum and the devil and eternity\u201d, Philip Roth (\u201cIt\u2019s just sex. He rarely examines what his characters want from sex\u201d), Nicholson Baker (\u201cOnly in America could a novelist who writes about sex as if it were a subset of the Shopping Channel be praised as the thinking person\u2019s pornographer\u201d), Susan Sontag (\u201cgetting it wrong, as always\u201d) and so on. But most of the authors are there to legitimise his ideas and experiences, and to show that he\u2019s not alone in his frailties.</p> <p>He may be breaking no taboos but what gives the book its frisson is the sound of an intellectual talking dirty. One minute he\u2019s quoting Dostoevsky, the next he\u2019s asking his wife if he can share her vibrator. High/low, private/public: the demarcations disappear. And for all his talk of being miserable and pathetic (\u201cThe only music I\u2019ve ever really loved is lamentation\u201d), he takes a certain pleasure in the performance, with a good number of jokes (\u201cDid you hear about the Scottish woman who loved her husband so much she nearly told him?\u201d). Above all, there\u2019s his curiosity and openness, and his gift for collecting memorable quotations.</p> <p>The book comes with fulsome advance praise: \u201cA great book such as no one has ever written\u201d; \u201cThe most boldly naked book I\u2019ve ever read\u201d, \u201cThe most original, insightful and heartbreaking book about sexual desire since Roland Barthes\u2019s <em>A Lover\u2019s Discourse</em>\u201d. Shields, less extravagantly, calls it \u201cmuch the most self-mortifying\u201d of his books. What will his wife think? She once told him that what he regards as his weakness she sees as his vulnerability, \u201cwhich I love\u201d. And Shields\u2019s truth-telling is certainly vulnerable. Some room for hope, then, that their marriage might survive publication.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Trouble With Men: Reflections on Sex, Love, Marriage, Porn and Power </em>is published by Mad Creek.</p>",

He wasn\u2019t unpopular at school (a keen sportsman, he has never known happiness to equal that of playing basketball), but there were paranoid moments at the swimming pool lockers when the other boys seemed to be sniggering at the size of his penis (he\u2019d have liked to explain to them that he\u2019s a \u201cgrow-er not a show-er\u201d). Still a virgin at 19, he ruined things with his first girlfriend by admitting he\u2019d secretly read her diary entries about him. \u201cI\u2019m always the poor pup that loses,\u201d he concludes, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s drawn to the poor pups of literature, the self-harmers and self-destroyers. It\u2019s also what he wants from sex, to be humiliated: \u201cI need to believe you hate me and go to bed with me only because you have to \u2026 The only thing that\u2019s sexy to me is what hurts.\u201d It\u2019s brave of Shields to parade himself as cravenly as he does and he covers a lot of ground along the way: anal sex, oral sex, porn (\u201cthe world\u2019s one true religion\u201d), cross-dressing, scatological fixations, foot fetishism and so on. Not that he\u2019s into them all, but he\u2019s trying to solve the puzzle of who he is, \u201cto find out how in the world I got wired this way\u201d. His masochism is more than Jewish self-hatred. The best authors have it too: is there \u201cany \u2018major\u2019 modernist writer \u2013 Franz Kafka, Virginia Woolf, Proust, Thomas Mann, James Joyce, TS Eliot \u2013 who wasn\u2019t flagrantly masochistic?\u201d He even connects masochism to his habit of quoting authors without attribution. In Reality Hunger he defended it as a principled stand against copyright laws. Here he admits it was also \u201ca way to be \u2018bad\u2019 and get spanked\u201d. He won\u2019t get spanked this time. The basic method remains the same \u2013 his argument set out through a collage of thematically linked fragments, with him as both author and curator \u2013 but the writers he draws on are given their due in square brackets. He takes swipes at some of them: Norman Mailer \u201cand his insane theories about the rectum and the devil and eternity\u201d, Philip Roth (\u201cIt\u2019s just sex. He rarely examines what his characters want from sex\u201d), Nicholson Baker (\u201cOnly in America could a novelist who writes about sex as if it were a subset of the Shopping Channel be praised as the thinking person\u2019s pornographer\u201d), Susan Sontag (\u201cgetting it wrong, as always\u201d) and so on. But most of the authors are there to legitimise his ideas and experiences, and to show that he\u2019s not alone in his frailties. He may be breaking no taboos but what gives the book its frisson is the sound of an intellectual talking dirty. One minute he\u2019s quoting Dostoevsky, the next he\u2019s asking his wife if he can share her vibrator. High/low, private/public: the demarcations disappear. And for all his talk of being miserable and pathetic (\u201cThe only music I\u2019ve ever really loved is lamentation\u201d), he takes a certain pleasure in the performance, with a good number of jokes (\u201cDid you hear about the Scottish woman who loved her husband so much she nearly told him?\u201d). Above all, there\u2019s his curiosity and openness, and his gift for collecting memorable quotations. The book comes with fulsome advance praise: \u201cA great book such as no one has ever written\u201d; \u201cThe most boldly naked book I\u2019ve ever read\u201d, \u201cThe most original, insightful and heartbreaking book about sexual desire since Roland Barthes\u2019s A Lover\u2019s Discourse\u201d. Shields, less extravagantly, calls it \u201cmuch the most self-mortifying\u201d of his books. What will his wife think? She once told him that what he regards as his weakness she sees as his vulnerability, \u201cwhich I love\u201d. And Shields\u2019s truth-telling is certainly vulnerable. Some room for hope, then, that their marriage might survive publication. \u2022 The Trouble With Men: Reflections on Sex, Love, Marriage, Porn and Power is published by Mad Creek.",

Another London branch opens in Kensington later in the year. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a333, pointahotels.com The Frogmill, Gloucestershire This 16th-century Cotswolds pub was refurbished last year, and now has 28 bedrooms over three buildings. Classic rooms have kingsize beds and plenty of character, with panelled walls and Modigliani prints. Superior rooms have roll-top baths, and those in the stable block have private patios. The bar serves five draught beers and 22 gins, and there is a restaurant, snug and terrace. Lots of dishes are cooked in the coal-fired Josper oven or the smoker, such as the boston beans at breakfast, the smoked salmon for lunch or the whisky-glazed pork belly for dinner. The pub is between the villages of Andoversford and Shipton Oliffe on the Cotswold Way national trail, seven miles from Cheltenham. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a377 room-only or \u00a390 B&amp;B, thefrogmill.co.uk",

The card applies to the vehicle, not the driver.</p> <p>Direct Line insurance says: \u201cIn the event of a no-deal Brexit, we have plans to ensure customers are provided with a green card if they drive in Europe on or after 29 March. Customers will need to contact us at least two weeks in advance of when they are due to travel.\u201d</p> <p>In Ireland, where 30,000 drivers commute across the border daily, and where shoppers from Dublin frequently head to Belfast and vice versa, the green cards issued are likely to be valid for one year. Irish insurers have prepared 400,000 green card forms in the event of no deal, and some UK insurers are now proactively sending green cards to customers in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Insurers say they are already incurring hefty costs to organise the cards and prepare their staff in call centres to handle an inevitable barrage of questions. The Association of British Insurers says it would much rather none of this was happening. \u201cIt remains the case that insurers do not want a no-deal Brexit; it would be bad for the economy and bad for our customers,\u201d it says. \u201cWe continue to hope these arrangements are never needed and urge the government, UK parliament and EU27 to agree an orderly way forward.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, if your UK-registered car sports an EU flag on its numberplate, you might want to buy a GB sticker. From 29 March, if the UK leaves without a deal, the government says: \u201cYou may need a GB sticker even if your vehicle has a europlate [displaying both the EU flag and a GB sign]. You will not need a GB sticker to drive outside the UK if you replace a europlate with a numberplate that features the GB sign without the EU flag.\u201d <strong>PC</strong></p> <h2><strong>Driving with a UK licence when abroad</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d154e3fa9fa2df55b5ebc80b7fb8e71d6fc2976\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d154e3fa9fa2df55b5ebc80b7fb8e71d6fc2976/0_0_3784_2271/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cars wait at a departure point at the car ferry terminal in Calais, France.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cars wait at a departure point at the car ferry terminal in Calais, France.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michel Spingler/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>In a sentence</strong> <em>You will have to buy an International Driving Permit to drive in Europe, at a price of \u00a35.50, with different ones required for France and Spain</em></p> <p>If there is no deal with the EU then recognition of UK driving licences in the EU ends. So British drivers will have to go to the Post Office and obtain an International Driving Permit (IDP), which you will need to carry with you in conjunction with your UK driving licence.</p> <p>There is a curious twist to the international rules which means that if, say, you drive through France and into Spain, you\u2019ll need two different IDPs. That\u2019s because the 1949 IDP convention covers Spain, Malta, Cyprus and Ireland, while the 1968 IDP convention covers all other EU countries, plus Norway and Switzerland.</p> <p>So at the Post Office you have to specify which permit you want, depending on which country you are visiting, or get both if driving between France and Spain or Portugal and Spain.</p> <p>And just to add a little more complexity, the permit you buy for Portugal will last three years, but in Spain you\u2019ll have to renew it every year.</p> <p>The Post Office has set up a <a href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/international-driving-permit\">webpage dedicated to this process</a>. But you can\u2019t buy it online \u2013 you\u2019ll have to head to a Post Office with your driving licence, passport and a passport-sized photograph.</p> <p>As regards driving back and forth between the UK and Ireland, there has been significant confusion.</p> <p>Last September the government\u2019s official position was that an IDP would be required if driving across the Northern Ireland border. But in January this advice was withdrawn, and it now says: \u201cIf you hold a UK driving licence you should not need an IDP to drive in Ireland from 29 March as Ireland does not currently require IDPs to be held by driving licence holders from non-EU countries.\u201d</p> <p>It was also revealed this week that British citizens resident in Ireland \u2013 estimated to number about 300,000 \u2013 will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/uk-driving-licences-will-not-be-valid-in-ireland-under-no-deal-brexit\">required to swap their UK driving licence for an Irish one</a> at a fee of \u20ac55 (\u00a348) if there is no deal on Brexit. <strong>PC</strong></p> <h2><strong>European Health Insurance Card</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ee58b2fda717cf732be49177252822843efc88b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ee58b2fda717cf732be49177252822843efc88b/0_0_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"A doctor in her office\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A doctor will see you now \u2026 or maybe not.

Those studying or working temporarily abroad already won\u2019t be able to buy travel insurance as they have already left. They will probably just have to risk it as, alternatively, they face having to buy expensive local insurance, which will run into several hundred pounds.</p> <p>Ehic was never intended to cover long-term residents who had moved to another country, but many relied on it particularly if they spent only part of the year abroad, or for when they had just arrived in a new country. <strong>MB</strong></p> <h2><strong>Visas and travel</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"762124089a8ed2cba2c3b65e4e823ae55b25a04a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/762124089a8ed2cba2c3b65e4e823ae55b25a04a/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers queue at check-in at Gatwick\u2019s South Terminal building.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers queue at check-in at Gatwick\u2019s South Terminal building.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>In a sentence: </strong><em>Visa-free travel to Europe ends, paving the way for possible \u00a352 90-day visas</em></p> <p>It\u2019s arguably the craziest prospect of all, but if the Brexit impasse is not broken, British tourists face having to apply for a visa to visit most of mainland Europe.</p> <p>That was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/20/britons-may-need-52-visa-to-visit-mainland-europe-after-brexit\">warning from Brussels this week</a> where reports say there is a very real prospect of UK citizens having to apply for a \u20ac60 (\u00a352) visa to enter the Schengen area, which includes most of the EU countries we generally visit.</p> <p>The problem concerns talks that have become mired in a dispute with Spain over whether the British overseas territory Gibraltar should be described as a \u201ccolony\u201d in the EU\u2019s statute book.</p> <p>If no solution can be found the UK will be left in legal limbo as it is not on the list of countries where a visa is required to visit the EU, nor on a list of countries with an exemption.</p> <p>It could mean UK citizens heading to Europe for Easter having to pay for a Schengen visa or be left waiting for a bilateral deal. In a tit-for-tat move, EU citizens coming to the UK would face a similar scheme.

The EU Withdrawal Act provides that EU regulations \u2013 as applied now \u2013 will convert into domestic law, meaning the same rules will continue to apply until legislators in the UK decide otherwise.</p> <p>On the face of it, passengers will still be able to <a href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/if-your-flights-delayed-or-cancelled/\">claim to up to \u20ac600</a> (\u00a3536) in compensation when airline problems cause their flight to land more than three hours late, or is cancelled. They will also be entitled to meals and hotels if the delays are caused by problems beyond the airline\u2019s control.</p> <p>However, with just over a month to go, specialist flight compensation lawyers say there has been no explanation as to how it will work. The compensation rules currently apply to all airlines based in the EU, and flights out of EU airports on non-EU-based carriers.</p> <p>The wording of the new legislation would have to watertight, says Coby Benson, solicitor at Bott and Co, because in the past the airlines have used any ambiguity to dismiss legitimate claims, and have fought them through the courts.</p> <p>\u201cWe anticipate that if the new adopted legislation is not entirely clear, the airlines will seize upon this to allow them to wriggle out of paying. This has been the history of this legislation from the start, and I can only foresee further court battles. If the airlines spot a get-out opportunity, they will try to use it to their advantage,\u201d he says. <strong>MB</strong></p> <h2><strong>Pets</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"080d6b65f59efda86cffbe015ccbde9288586c26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/080d6b65f59efda86cffbe015ccbde9288586c26/0_0_4600_2760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pet dogs in costume\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pets will need to travel with an animal health certificate issued by an officially registered vet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>In a sentence</strong> <em>The EU pet passport scheme ends for UK travellers and their cats and dogs \u2013 replaced with expensive tests every time they travel</em></p> <p>If you were planning to take your dog or cat on holiday to Europe after a no-deal Brexit, you may want to think again after you have read this.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s participation in the European Union pet passport scheme in effect ends on 29 March.

Sterling remains 12% below the level it was against the euro before the referendum, and currency dealers expect it to fall below \u20ac1.10 and $1.20 \u2013 and possibly much more \u2013 if there is no deal. <strong>PC</strong></p> <h2><strong>Bank accounts</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d6a5911f277d1acdd60c84f3dd74f51394f47b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d6a5911f277d1acdd60c84f3dd74f51394f47b4/0_177_5110_3067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"British passport on a pile of \u00a320 notes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banks report that they have been receiving calls from worried Brits living in the EU.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>In a sentence</strong> <em>The EU-mandated \u00a385,000 safety net will remain and the vast majority of UK account holders should be unaffected</em></p> <p>The immediate impact of no deal on UK bank account holders is likely to be minimal, but the cost of card payments between the UK and the EU is likely to rise and processing times become slower.</p> <p>Banks report that they have been receiving calls from worried Brits living in the EU who regularly access their UK-based bank account.

The official advice from the UK government is: \u201cFrom 29 March 2019, in the event that there is no EU exit deal \u2026 drivers of UK-registered vehicles will need to carry a motor insurance green card when driving in the EU and EEA.\u201d Note that a green card (and they do have to be on green paper) typically lasts only 90 days, and if your insurance renewal comes up while you\u2019re abroad, you will need one for each cover period. The card applies to the vehicle, not the driver. Direct Line insurance says: \u201cIn the event of a no-deal Brexit, we have plans to ensure customers are provided with a green card if they drive in Europe on or after 29 March. Customers will need to contact us at least two weeks in advance of when they are due to travel.\u201d In Ireland, where 30,000 drivers commute across the border daily, and where shoppers from Dublin frequently head to Belfast and vice versa, the green cards issued are likely to be valid for one year. Irish insurers have prepared 400,000 green card forms in the event of no deal, and some UK insurers are now proactively sending green cards to customers in Northern Ireland. Insurers say they are already incurring hefty costs to organise the cards and prepare their staff in call centres to handle an inevitable barrage of questions. The Association of British Insurers says it would much rather none of this was happening. \u201cIt remains the case that insurers do not want a no-deal Brexit; it would be bad for the economy and bad for our customers,\u201d it says. \u201cWe continue to hope these arrangements are never needed and urge the government, UK parliament and EU27 to agree an orderly way forward.\u201d Meanwhile, if your UK-registered car sports an EU flag on its numberplate, you might want to buy a GB sticker. From 29 March, if the UK leaves without a deal, the government says: \u201cYou may need a GB sticker even if your vehicle has a europlate [displaying both the EU flag and a GB sign]. You will not need a GB sticker to drive outside the UK if you replace a europlate with a numberplate that features the GB sign without the EU flag.\u201d PC Driving with a UK licence when abroad In a sentence You will have to buy an International Driving Permit to drive in Europe, at a price of \u00a35.50, with different ones required for France and Spain If there is no deal with the EU then recognition of UK driving licences in the EU ends. So British drivers will have to go to the Post Office and obtain an International Driving Permit (IDP), which you will need to carry with you in conjunction with your UK driving licence. There is a curious twist to the international rules which means that if, say, you drive through France and into Spain, you\u2019ll need two different IDPs. That\u2019s because the 1949 IDP convention covers Spain, Malta, Cyprus and Ireland, while the 1968 IDP convention covers all other EU countries, plus Norway and Switzerland. So at the Post Office you have to specify which permit you want, depending on which country you are visiting, or get both if driving between France and Spain or Portugal and Spain. And just to add a little more complexity, the permit you buy for Portugal will last three years, but in Spain you\u2019ll have to renew it every year. The Post Office has set up a webpage dedicated to this process. But you can\u2019t buy it online \u2013 you\u2019ll have to head to a Post Office with your driving licence, passport and a passport-sized photograph. As regards driving back and forth between the UK and Ireland, there has been significant confusion. Last September the government\u2019s official position was that an IDP would be required if driving across the Northern Ireland border. But in January this advice was withdrawn, and it now says: \u201cIf you hold a UK driving licence you should not need an IDP to drive in Ireland from 29 March as Ireland does not currently require IDPs to be held by driving licence holders from non-EU countries.\u201d It was also revealed this week that British citizens resident in Ireland \u2013 estimated to number about 300,000 \u2013 will be required to swap their UK driving licence for an Irish one at a fee of \u20ac55 (\u00a348) if there is no deal on Brexit. PC European Health Insurance Card In a sentence They will no longer be valid and buying travel insurance will become essential For years, Brits travelling, studying and working in Europe have relied on the European Health Insurance Card (Ehic) that entitled the holder to state-provided medical treatment if they fell ill or had an accident in an EU/EEA country. Two weeks ago, the UK government issued its latest advice on healthcare when travelling abroad, warning that if the UK leaves with no deal, our Ehics will no longer be valid. It has advised anyone travelling on or after 29 March to any of the EU countries as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, to buy travel insurance to cover healthcare \u201cjust as you would if visiting a non-EU country\u201d. It has said it is seeking agreements with countries on healthcare arrangements for UK nationals after Brexit day, but no such agreements are in place yet. Those studying or working temporarily abroad already won\u2019t be able to buy travel insurance as they have already left. They will probably just have to risk it as, alternatively, they face having to buy expensive local insurance, which will run into several hundred pounds. Ehic was never intended to cover long-term residents who had moved to another country, but many relied on it particularly if they spent only part of the year abroad, or for when they had just arrived in a new country. MB Visas and travel In a sentence: Visa-free travel to Europe ends, paving the way for possible \u00a352 90-day visas It\u2019s arguably the craziest prospect of all, but if the Brexit impasse is not broken, British tourists face having to apply for a visa to visit most of mainland Europe. That was the warning from Brussels this week where reports say there is a very real prospect of UK citizens having to apply for a \u20ac60 (\u00a352) visa to enter the Schengen area, which includes most of the EU countries we generally visit. The problem concerns talks that have become mired in a dispute with Spain over whether the British overseas territory Gibraltar should be described as a \u201ccolony\u201d in the EU\u2019s statute book. If no solution can be found the UK will be left in legal limbo as it is not on the list of countries where a visa is required to visit the EU, nor on a list of countries with an exemption. It could mean UK citizens heading to Europe for Easter having to pay for a Schengen visa or be left waiting for a bilateral deal. In a tit-for-tat move, EU citizens coming to the UK would face a similar scheme. Further down the line, the EU is proposing an electronic visa waiver system valid for three years at \u20ac7. Questions also remain about how travellers will be treated when they arrive in Europe. Portugal is the only EU state so far that has said it will create a third lane at airport passport control to speed Brits through. Without a deal, they face having to queue with all non-EU passport holders, with the inevitable long delays. MB Flight compensation In a sentence The government promises to keep EU flight delay payouts, but airlines could use changes to fight having to pay out European Union flight compensation regulations have been fought in almost every UK court, so could a no-deal Brexit give the airlines another opportunity to stop paying passengers after a lengthy delay or cancellation? That\u2019s the warning from lawyers this week \u2013 in spite of government promises that in the event of no deal, passenger flight rights will remain. The EU Withdrawal Act provides that EU regulations \u2013 as applied now \u2013 will convert into domestic law, meaning the same rules will continue to apply until legislators in the UK decide otherwise. On the face of it, passengers will still be able to claim to up to \u20ac600 (\u00a3536) in compensation when airline problems cause their flight to land more than three hours late, or is cancelled. They will also be entitled to meals and hotels if the delays are caused by problems beyond the airline\u2019s control. However, with just over a month to go, specialist flight compensation lawyers say there has been no explanation as to how it will work. The compensation rules currently apply to all airlines based in the EU, and flights out of EU airports on non-EU-based carriers. The wording of the new legislation would have to watertight, says Coby Benson, solicitor at Bott and Co, because in the past the airlines have used any ambiguity to dismiss legitimate claims, and have fought them through the courts. \u201cWe anticipate that if the new adopted legislation is not entirely clear, the airlines will seize upon this to allow them to wriggle out of paying. This has been the history of this legislation from the start, and I can only foresee further court battles. If the airlines spot a get-out opportunity, they will try to use it to their advantage,\u201d he says. MB Pets In a sentence The EU pet passport scheme ends for UK travellers and their cats and dogs \u2013 replaced with expensive tests every time they travel If you were planning to take your dog or cat on holiday to Europe after a no-deal Brexit, you may want to think again after you have read this. The UK\u2019s participation in the European Union pet passport scheme in effect ends on 29 March. It means that cat and dog owners (the documents also mention ferrets) will need to show that their animals are healthy \u2013 and produce new documents to support their animal\u2019s health when they arrive in the EU. Pet owners will also have to show that their animal been effectively vaccinated against rabies by undergoing a rabies antibody titration test at least 30 days after inoculation, and no fewer than three months before they enter the European Union. Pets will need to travel with an animal health certificate issued by an officially registered vet. This certificate can only be issued up to 10 days prior to entry into an EU member state. The British Veterinary Association has warned that a no-deal Brexit will lead to pet owners facing longer waits (pdf) to get their animal cleared for travel, higher costs for the required vaccination, treatments and health certificates each time they leave the UK. This comes at a time when many veterinary practices are already experiencing worker shortages and recruitment problems, it says. The advice is to book well ahead if you\u2019re planning to take your pet abroad. MB Mobile phone roaming charges In a sentence Phone companies say they have no plans to reintroduce charges \u2013 but don\u2019t rule them out either Arguably the EU\u2019s most significant consumer benefit of recent years has been the abolition of mobile phone roaming charges. The EU first capped then finally scrapped roaming charges across mainland Europe in June 2017. It means EU citizens can use their mobile in another EU state as if they are at home. Call plans that typically include 500 free minutes and 2GB data can be used abroad without incurring extra charges, which, before the EU\u2019s intervention, regularly cost more than the flight to your destination. But if the UK crashes out of the EU at the end of March, the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, has confirmed there will be nothing to stop mobile operators reimposing the charges. So hooked on smartphones have we all become, a return of roaming charges might be considered one of the worst impacts of leaving the EU. The biggest providers \u2013 Vodafone, O2 and EE \u2013 confirm they have no plans to reintroduce them on 1 April, but equally have not ruled out their reintroduction. Only Three has promised not to reinstate them irrespective of the Brexit outcome. Currently, EU mobile phone networks are not allowed to add extra charges to calls made by customers of other EU operators. That ends with a no deal. O2 says: \u201cWe will be working closely with the government and other European operators to try and protect the current arrangements, so our customers can continue to enjoy free EU roaming.\u201d Ministers have said the government will legislate to put a \u00a345-a-month limit on the amount that could be charged for mobile data abroad. There will also be requirements for customers to be informed when they have reached 80% and 100% of their data allowances. A future trade deal with the EU would include the abolition of, or limits to, mobile roaming charges, they have said. MB Pensions and investments In a sentence Retirees to Europe should worry about the future of their state pension, but private pension issues were largely resolved this week The 200,000 British citizens aged over 65 who have retired to the EU \u2013 half to Spain \u2013 still don\u2019t know if their UK state pension will be uprated every year after we leave the EU, or whether they\u2019ll join the \u201cfrozen\u2019 pensioners\u201d in Canada and Australia who have seen their pensions shrivel. The government has committed to uprate pensions across the EU in 2019 and 2020, but after that will only go ahead if there is a deal. It says: \u201cWe would wish to continue uprating pensions but would take decisions in light of whether, as we would hope and expect, reciprocal arrangements with the EU are in place.\u201d If they are not uprated, it could leave retirees in poverty and force a return to the UK. Someone retiring to Australia 20 years ago still receives the basic weekly UK state pension rate of \u00a366.75 prevailing at the time. But there\u2019s better news on private pensions. For months the UK pension industry has been in limbo around whether they can look after a private pension taken out in the UK if the person has retired to the EU. But this week the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) in Frankfurt said providers could continue to operate much as before, even with no deal. Steven Cameron of Aegon says: \u201cThere were concerns that UK providers might have been unable to service the policies of such individuals. We very much hope EU regulators will confirm they are following EIOPA\u2019s recommendations and will not treat these policies as \u2018cross border\u2019 which should allow servicing to continue.\u201d Investments in funds, such as equity Isas, should be unaffected with a \u201ctemporary permissions regime\u201d in place even if we crash out. The much bigger picture is what happens to stock markets and sterling in the event of a cliff-edge withdrawal. Sterling remains 12% below the level it was against the euro before the referendum, and currency dealers expect it to fall below \u20ac1.10 and $1.20 \u2013 and possibly much more \u2013 if there is no deal. PC Bank accounts In a sentence The EU-mandated \u00a385,000 safety net will remain and the vast majority of UK account holders should be unaffected The immediate impact of no deal on UK bank account holders is likely to be minimal, but the cost of card payments between the UK and the EU is likely to rise and processing times become slower. Banks report that they have been receiving calls from worried Brits living in the EU who regularly access their UK-based bank account. Will a hard Brexit mean they can no longer use these accounts? The banks are assuring customers that they can continue to use them and transfer money overseas as they did before. Even if a bank appears to be from an EU country, there are few issues. For example, both Santander UK and Bank of Ireland (UK) are domiciled in the UK for regulatory purposes and post Brexit will be treated exactly the same as Lloyds or Barclays. However, there are those who are domiciled outside the UK and use EU membership to \u201cpassport\u201d their services to the UK. But even here agreement has been reached, with a temporary permissions regime allowing them to carry on in the UK for three years after Brexit, and apply for authorisation during that time. The \u00a385,000 protection for deposit accounts is partly the product of EU directives. But the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) says: \u201cFSCS protection for UK-based customers of UK authorised firms will not change, regardless of whether the UK leaves with or without a deal.\u201d PC",

      "bodyText": "Over a bowl of pulled pork, lentils, giardiniera and mixed greens, with the Eagles\u2019 Peaceful Easy Feeling playing in the background, Pete Buttigieg is asked a question that no elected official running for US president has ever been asked before. What was it like growing up gay? \u201cI wasn\u2019t even prepared to acknowledge to myself that I was gay at school,\u201d he said, reflecting on his childhood in South Bend, Indiana, a conservative state governed, until recently, by vice-president Mike Pence. \u201cI had never met an out person my age the entire time I went to school; didn\u2019t know that there was such a thing. I had heard of one at another school. So it was just literally out of the question.\u201d Being out is one of many noteworthy things about Buttigieg, a little-known contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination for the party\u2019s candidate for presidency. He is the son of a Maltese immigrant, Christian, contemporary of Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard, Rhodes scholar at Oxford, city mayor before his 30th birthday, Afghanistan war veteran, piano player, polyglot, fan of James Joyce and, now, at the grand old age of 37, would-be first millennial president. Too much, too young? Democrats seem to like the promise of generational change, their past four presidents having been John F Kennedy (aged 43), Jimmy Carter (52), Bill Clinton (46) and Barack Obama (47). As Buttigieg likes to point out, he would take office with more military experience than any commander in chief since George HW Bush and, when he reaches Trump\u2019s current age, the year will be 2054 \u2013 meaning that issues such as climate change are not abstract to him but viscerally personal. His age and sexuality are standout features in a crowded Democratic field that he neither makes a big play of nor seeks to \u201cpaper over\u201d. When he held his first meetings with Iowa voters, his husband Chasten was in the room. Last week Chasten, a teacher, retweeted a post from a Twitter user called Adam, from Alabama, that said: \u201cI wish I could tell 15-year-old me who was praying for God to make me something other than gay, that at 32 you\u2019ll be donating to an openly gay man making a run for president.\u201d Buttigieg sits down for lunch with the Guardian at the polished but unpretentious L Street Kitchen, one more indicator of South Bend\u2019s rebound on his watch. Coming out here, he acknowledges, was a long and difficult process. \u201cThe hardest part was a period lasting a few years when I had decided that I was not willing to lie about this, and I also knew that I was not ready to talk about this, and I was simply relying on luck that nobody had really pushed me because I\u2019d have to deflect something.\u201d Although he was not put in a position of having to choose between lying and coming out, at one point a local reporter threatened to out him which, he notes wryly, \u201cwas especially interesting because I had zero love life at that point so it was based completely on speculation\u201d. Elected mayor of South Bend at 29, he came out publicly in a column in the South Bend Tribune newspaper while seeking re-election. The governor of Indiana at the time was Pence, a born-again Christian who denies the right of LGBT people to marry or serve in the military, and who is now Trump\u2019s vice-president. But South Bend is closer to Chicago than Indianapolis and Buttigieg won 80% of the vote, more than the first time \u2013 though even now, when he and Chasten go to church, a man walks outside brandishing a sign: \u201cSame sex marriage is sin.\u201d After lunch, Buttigieg crosses the street and is approached by a local man. He responds cordially, as he does dozens of times a day. This is the bread \u2013 and \u2013 butter of being mayor of a modestly-sized city, a post from which he took a seven-month leave to deploy to Afghanistan with the navy reserve in 2014. He goes up to the 14th floor office where John F Kennedy\u2019s inaugural address hangs above his desk, a photo of Buttigieg with Michelle Obama sits on a sideboard, and Winston Churchill\u2019s 12-volume history of the second world war shares the bookshelves with Making Gay History by Eric Marcus. There is also a fragment of blue stone from Buttigieg\u2019s first trip to Iraq as a civilian adviser; he recites the inscription in convincing Arabic, then translates: \u201c\u2018Not everyone who rides on a horse is a knight.\u2019 I keep it here to remind myself, just because you have an office or a title doesn\u2019t mean much unless you do something with it.\u201d Buttigieg speaks Arabic, Dari, French, Italian, Maltese, Norwegian and Spanish to greater or lesser extents but has a Midwestern understatement that seems to neutralise Trump-era sneering and anti-intellectualism. The mayor\u2019s office offers sweeping views of South Bend, a city of 100,000 people that endured \u201crusted-out factories scattered like tombstones\u201d, as Trump put it in his inaugural address, long before Nafta, mass automation or JD Vance\u2019s Hillbilly Elegy. The Studebaker car assembly plant closed down a month after Kennedy\u2019s assassination in 1963, resulting in lost jobs and lost pensions, depression, poverty and suicides, decades of population decline and empty shop fronts downtown. By 2010, South Bend was on Newsweek\u2019s list of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Dying Cities\u201d. Surveying the snowy scene today, Buttigieg can see the hospital where he was born. He points to two identical churches, originally built for Irish and Polish immigrants, as evidence that this has always been a global city, and notes that 45% of South Bend\u2019s current population is non-white. \u201cLook at the size of that house: that shows you the scale of wealth that was associated with the industrial heyday. See out toward the horizon that long factory building? That was where the cabinet for every Singer sewing machine in the country was assembled. \u201cThis was the Silicon Valley of its day. Now we\u2019re trying to get the term \u2018Silicon Prairie\u2019 to catch on because there\u2019s a whole new shot at it.\u201d Visitors to the new South Bend are greeted by Buttigieg\u2019s voice on the airport loudspeaker, rounding off: \u201cSafe travels, and I\u2019ll see you around the Bend!\u201d His audacious 1,000 houses in 1,000 days initiative demolished or repaired abandoned homes. Old Studebaker buildings are being renovated and converted into mixed use spaces. Buttigieg made streets more pedestrian-friendly and introduced a public art installation called River Lights on the main waterway. He has also brought a millennial\u2019s instinct for tech to running the city, gathering systematic data on everything from rubbish collection to gunshots. Asked if any of this can be scaled up to America if he was president, Buttigieg contends that the kind of government shutdown that Trump oversaw is unthinkable at city level where, whatever the political differences, water must be supplied and snow must be ploughed. \u201cThere are no alternative facts. If there\u2019s a hole in the road, I can\u2019t bullshit people and say there\u2019s no hole in the road. People can tell and they\u2019ll beat me over the head until we fix it.\u201d He adds: \u201cThere\u2019s something in the midwestern political culture that\u2019s very reality based that I think belongs more in the national dialogue.

But if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, both will fall back on the World Trade Organisation\u2019s \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d tariffs, which means they must pay import duties on each other\u2019s trade.</p> <p>On that basis the UK\u2019s 2017 EU food imports would come with a hefty \u00a39.3bn tariff bill on top, according to Retail Economics\u2019s analysis.</p> <p>\u201cThe worst case scenario is most favoured nation tariff rates for everything,\u201d explains William Bain, a policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium, who says even if the plan now is to cut tariffs on some products, time was running out for retailers take action.</p> <p>\u201cWe may see some movement on some products but this is with five weeks to go,\u201d he said. \u201cRetailers\u2019 cashflows are very sensitive and they have only got 35 days to make important IT changes and train staff. This is not a good place for retailers to be in at all.\u201d</p> <p>Tariffs are paid by the importer and can be levied in different ways. It can be a flat-rate tariff linked to weight \u2013 as is the case with cheddar cheese \u2013 or calculated as a proportion of the overall value of the goods. It can also be a mixture of both. A country can set a quota, enabling a certain volume of a product to flow in before a higher tariff rate kicks in.</p> <p>The BRC says increased tariffs and new regulatory checks in the event of a no-deal Brexit could increase the cost of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/21/uk-and-ireland-retailers-warn-of-40-tariffs-on-food-in-no-deal-brexit\">sourcing some everyday food items by up to 45%</a>.</p> <p>The retail organisation says, however, that it is hard to predict exactly what the impact will be on shoppers\u2019 pockets as a result of other factors, such as currency movements and commodity markets.</p> <p>But the imposition of WTO tariffs on beef sourced from the EU could increase the price by anywhere between 5% and 29%, it estimates. Tomato prices could rise by 9-18% and cheddar by between 6% and 32%.</p> <p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a direct relationship between tariff costs and consumer prices,\u201d said Bain, due to the fact not all the food we buy is imported and quantities vary depending on the time of year.</p> <p>But the direction of travel for prices looks clear, as demonstrated by Britain\u2019s favourite cheese: cheddar. In 2016 the UK bought almost 93,000 tonnes of cheddar from Ireland tariff-free, but without a trade deal that cheese mountain would attract an import duty of \u20ac1671 (\u00a31451) per tonne. That adds up to a bill of \u20ac155m (\u00a3134.6m) according to a Dairy Industry Ireland (DI) study.</p> <p>DI director Conor Mulvihill said that with the current market price of cheddar at around \u20ac3000 per tonne, the imposition of tariffs would equate to a near 56% increase in sourcing costs for British food companies buying cheese from Ireland. \u201cThere will be a cheddar shortage unless retailers are willing to pay 50% more,\u201d suggests Mulvihill. \u201cPrices for consumers will inevitably rise.\u201d</p> <p>There had been reports that Britain was considering a zero-tariff regime in a no-deal situation, but on Tuesday Michael Gove, the environment secretary, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/a-world-to-win\">told the National Farmers\u2019 Union annual conference</a> that would not be the case. The tariff schedule would be published in the \u201cnext few days\u201d he said, promising \u201cprotections for sensitive sections of agriculture and food production\u201d.</p> <p>One source told the Guardian that the government was grouping foods into bands with ratcheting tariff levels. Foods such as oranges and bananas, which are not grown in the UK, could be zero-rated, but \u201csensitive\u201d products \u2013 such as beef and cheese \u2013 would be managed with a combination of WTO tariffs and a quota.</p> <p>Lim said if tariffs stoked food price inflation it would hit the less affluent hardest because they spend a bigger percentage of their income on food. \u201cWill retailers be able to pass on higher sourcing costs to consumers in this fiercely competitive market?\u201d he asks. \u201cRetailers will have to look at sourcing from other countries ... whether that leads to poorer quality, less choice and higher prices will depend on a product by product basis.\u201d</p>",

But if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, both will fall back on the World Trade Organisation\u2019s \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d tariffs, which means they must pay import duties on each other\u2019s trade. On that basis the UK\u2019s 2017 EU food imports would come with a hefty \u00a39.3bn tariff bill on top, according to Retail Economics\u2019s analysis. \u201cThe worst case scenario is most favoured nation tariff rates for everything,\u201d explains William Bain, a policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium, who says even if the plan now is to cut tariffs on some products, time was running out for retailers take action. \u201cWe may see some movement on some products but this is with five weeks to go,\u201d he said. \u201cRetailers\u2019 cashflows are very sensitive and they have only got 35 days to make important IT changes and train staff. This is not a good place for retailers to be in at all.\u201d Tariffs are paid by the importer and can be levied in different ways. It can be a flat-rate tariff linked to weight \u2013 as is the case with cheddar cheese \u2013 or calculated as a proportion of the overall value of the goods. It can also be a mixture of both. A country can set a quota, enabling a certain volume of a product to flow in before a higher tariff rate kicks in. The BRC says increased tariffs and new regulatory checks in the event of a no-deal Brexit could increase the cost of sourcing some everyday food items by up to 45%. The retail organisation says, however, that it is hard to predict exactly what the impact will be on shoppers\u2019 pockets as a result of other factors, such as currency movements and commodity markets. But the imposition of WTO tariffs on beef sourced from the EU could increase the price by anywhere between 5% and 29%, it estimates. Tomato prices could rise by 9-18% and cheddar by between 6% and 32%. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a direct relationship between tariff costs and consumer prices,\u201d said Bain, due to the fact not all the food we buy is imported and quantities vary depending on the time of year. But the direction of travel for prices looks clear, as demonstrated by Britain\u2019s favourite cheese: cheddar. In 2016 the UK bought almost 93,000 tonnes of cheddar from Ireland tariff-free, but without a trade deal that cheese mountain would attract an import duty of \u20ac1671 (\u00a31451) per tonne. That adds up to a bill of \u20ac155m (\u00a3134.6m) according to a Dairy Industry Ireland (DI) study. DI director Conor Mulvihill said that with the current market price of cheddar at around \u20ac3000 per tonne, the imposition of tariffs would equate to a near 56% increase in sourcing costs for British food companies buying cheese from Ireland. \u201cThere will be a cheddar shortage unless retailers are willing to pay 50% more,\u201d suggests Mulvihill. \u201cPrices for consumers will inevitably rise.\u201d There had been reports that Britain was considering a zero-tariff regime in a no-deal situation, but on Tuesday Michael Gove, the environment secretary, told the National Farmers\u2019 Union annual conference that would not be the case. The tariff schedule would be published in the \u201cnext few days\u201d he said, promising \u201cprotections for sensitive sections of agriculture and food production\u201d. One source told the Guardian that the government was grouping foods into bands with ratcheting tariff levels. Foods such as oranges and bananas, which are not grown in the UK, could be zero-rated, but \u201csensitive\u201d products \u2013 such as beef and cheese \u2013 would be managed with a combination of WTO tariffs and a quota. Lim said if tariffs stoked food price inflation it would hit the less affluent hardest because they spend a bigger percentage of their income on food. \u201cWill retailers be able to pass on higher sourcing costs to consumers in this fiercely competitive market?\u201d he asks. \u201cRetailers will have to look at sourcing from other countries ... whether that leads to poorer quality, less choice and higher prices will depend on a product by product basis.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s first emperor ordered his subjects to search for the elixir of life in a quest for immortality. In 16th century France, nobles would drink gold in a bid to extend their lifespans. Gilgamesh, the Sumerian king at the heart of humanity\u2019s earliest epic poem, found a magic herb, but a snake ate it. In 2015, a woman on the MTV series True Life: I\u2019m Obsessed With Staying Young bathed in pig blood. In 2019, the quest for everlasting life is, largely, though not always, more scientific. Funded by Silicon Valley elites, researchers believe they are closer than ever to tweaking the human body so that we can finally live forever (or quite a bit longer), even as some worry about pseudoscience in the sector. Scientists and entrepreneurs are working on a range of techniques, from attempting to stop cells aging, to the practice of injecting young blood into old people \u2013 a process denounced as quackery by the Federal Drug Administration this week. \u201cThere\u2019s millions of people now who won\u2019t see death if they choose,\u201d said James Strole, the director of the Coalition of Radical Life Extension, an organization which brings together scientists and enthusiasts interested in \u201cphysical immortality\u201d. At present our bodies are built to last \u2013 \u201cif you took perfect care of your body\u201d \u2013 125 years, according to Strole. The problem is that if someone did live to be 125, they are unlikely to remain spry into their final decades. \u201cWho wants to live in some decrepit state?\u201d Strole said. \u201cWe\u2019ve increased lifespans a lot, but we haven\u2019t improved quality of lifespan.\u201d That\u2019s where what enthusiasts called \u201csuper longevity\u201d comes in. A number of billionaires have pumped money into research that aims to keep people fighting fit as they age. Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have pumped millions into Calico, a secretive health venture which aims to \u201csolve death\u201d. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and the billionaire Peter Thiel are backers of Unity Biotechnology, which hopes to combat the effects of aging. The idea of never dying might sound like something from science fiction, but the experimental techniques are far removed from a brain in a jar, a body in a freezer or a heart wired up to a car battery. Sierra Sciences is another company racing to cheat death. Its focus is on treatments that can lengthen telomeres \u2013 the \u201ccaps\u201d at the end of each strand of DNA. Telomeres get shorter each time a cell copies itself. Because our cells copy themselves throughout our lives, the telomeres eventually get very short, and our cells cannot regenerate: we get old. \u201cIf you can get the telomeres back to the normal state they were at when you were born, that could reduce your biological age back to 25,\u201d Strole said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be reversed back to a baby. You stop where maturity begins and ends.\u201d Among Sierra Sciences competitors is BioViva, whose CEO, Elizabeth Parrish, is so committed to the cause that she became one of the first humans to undergo telomere therapy in 2015. Writing in 2018, she claimed a measurement of her telomeres showed they had \u201cgrown younger\u201d by roughly 30 years since she received the treatment \u2013 her body was reverse-aging. Others claim they can already prevent aging in animals. George Church, a Harvard professor and the founder of Rejuvenate Bio, uses gene therapy to add anti-aging instructions to DNA. Church says he has succeeded in making mice live twice as long, and the secretive company is said to be planning imminent testing on dogs. The discovery by Calico scientists in 2018 that naked mole rats \u2013 which look exactly how they sound, except with bigger teeth \u2013 essentially do not age fueled further excitement in the quest for immortality. According to Science magazine the defiance is due to \u201cvery active DNA repair and high levels of chaperones, proteins that help other proteins fold correctly\u201d, and the hope is that some of the discoveries could be applied to humans. If and when these technologies became available, they are likely to be fantastically expensive. Strole said demand could eventually lower the price, but plenty of non-billionaires could die in the meantime. Besides that, everyone living much, much longer would cause many other problems. Where do the children of these centenarians live? Until workable life-preserving technology is available, immortality enthusiasts are also obsessed with staying healthy \u2013 some fast on certain days, others watch calories, most exercise \u2013 so they are around long enough to benefit from emerging anti-aging science. The aim, as many in the \u201cphysical immortality community\u201d put it, is to: \u201cLive long enough to live forever.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><strong>\u2018</strong><strong>When I moved, I had to rent a trailer to take the toilet rolls.\u2019 </strong><strong>Frank Cazares, 30, costume designer, Palm Springs, California, US</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve always been pretty crafty. At school, I could make anything from scraps and, in 2014, an old teacher contacted me with details of a competition running on a bridal blog. Participants were asked to design a wedding dress out of toilet paper. I procrastinated for a long time until, three days before deadline, I decided to go for it.</p> <p>You could use any number of toilet rolls, plus tape, glue or thread. The top 10 designs would be modelled at the finals in New York, and the ultimate winner would get a $10,000 prize.</p> <p>I spent $100 on toilet paper and didn\u2019t sleep for two days. My design was an elaborately constructed off-the-shoulder dress, with fringing and a train of paper roses. It earned me a place in the finals and, while I didn\u2019t win the cash prize, there was a lady from the toilet paper industry on the judging panel who sprang from her seat, applauded wildly and declared my dress worthy of a lifetime supply. It was kind of shocking and unexpected, but everyone laughed and cheered: it was a celebration of my dress. It wasn\u2019t the most glamorous prize but it was at least practical.</p> <p>The toilet rolls started arriving three months later. I was at design school in Orange County and living in a rented room, so my housemates were pretty excited when I got a phone call from UPS saying there was a big order for me to pick up. I pulled up at the depot in my Mini Cooper expecting a large package, and was met by two pallets, piled high with about 20 boxes, containing hundreds of rolls. I couldn\u2019t get it all in the car. I folded the seats down, opened up boxes and shoved packets in every footwell. I was sweating. It was like something out of a movie.</p> <p>This would happen every two or three months; I would receive up to 400 rolls at a time. I\u2019d go to the warehouse, or a haulage truck would pull up outside my house.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After about three years, when the deliveries abruptly stopped, I was shocked. My lifetime supply had been sent up front</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Storing it was a problem. I made a bedside table out of it, put it under my desk, in my wardrobe and in the garage. Christmas 2014 was the cheapest ever; everyone got toilet roll. At work, I wrapped up an 18-roll pack for our white-elephant game \u2013 a bit like secret Santa \u2013 and everyone fought over it. I gave them out for family birthdays because they were coming so thick and fast, but they sent a mix of qualities and I always kept the more expensive mega rolls, which were softer and more luxurious, for myself. When I moved across state, I had to rent a trailer to take the toilet rolls with me.</p> <p>After about three years, when the deliveries abruptly stopped, I was pretty shocked. I had failed to figure out that my entire lifetime supply had been sent up front \u2013 that was why I had received so much, so often. The company had calculated how many rolls a man my age, living alone, would need for life and delivered them all. I wished then that I hadn\u2019t been so generous, and became more reserved about giving them away. My supply eventually ran out in early 2017: I had blown it in a couple of years.</p> <p>I\u2019m still known as \u201cthe toilet paper guy\u201d. It\u2019s a never-ending joke with my friends and I still get stopped by strangers at the mall. A few weeks ago, it happened at a local restaurant.</p> <p>I chuckle inside every time I have to buy toilet paper at the supermarket; but it hurts a bit, too. Sometimes I take a picture at the checkout and send it to friends.</p> <p><strong>\u2018I thought I\u2019d be eating KFC every day, but I get one bonus bucket a month.\u2019 Lewis Austin, 22, double-glazing salesman, Bridgend</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b68313b540bd0dfdc5844c26d2ecc4ff5b61a20b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b68313b540bd0dfdc5844c26d2ecc4ff5b61a20b/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lewis Austin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When I was 18, I used to watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/KSIOlajidebt\" title=\"\">the YouTuber KSI</a> and at the end of one of his videos he advertised a competition to win 50 years\u2019 worth of free KFC, to celebrate its 50th birthday. I used to eat there fairly often \u2013 not because I loved it, more because I couldn\u2019t be bothered to cook. So I thought, \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>You had to tell Twitter what you would do to win the prize, and there were all sorts of ridiculous suggestions. It was free to enter, so I had a few goes. The first thing that came into my head was: \u201cI\u2019d eat the hottest chilli in the world.\u201d I put it up there with the hashtag and forgot about it.</p> <p>About three months I was woken by a call from an unknown number at 9am. It was a guy from KFC telling me I\u2019d submitted one of its favourite answers and won. He asked me to go to a branch in Bracknell to film a promotional video with the other winners a few days later. I never thought I\u2019d be on YouTube, but the video is still up there. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PymwrZTdLUc\" title=\"\">You can see me eating my ghost chilli</a>. I went for it in one go; at first I didn\u2019t think it was so bad but I quickly started sweating. They gave me a frozen drink to cool me down. There was a guy who bungee jumped, another who was rugby tackled and a woman who got married in the restaurant; there were flowers out and everything. I absolutely loved life that day. I had all these cameras in my face. I felt like I was a big deal, and all my mates were talking about it.</p> <p>I signed my winner\u2019s contract but, if I\u2019m honest, I didn\u2019t read it, so when the prize started to arrive it wasn\u2019t exactly what I had imagined. I thought I\u2019d be eating KFC every day if I wanted, but each year I get a golden chequebook with 12 \u201ccheques\u201d \u2013 one for each month, entitling me to a KFC bonus bucket or a 12-piece sharing bucket.</p> <p>When the first one arrived, in 2015, I headed to a local branch to try it out. They didn\u2019t know what it was and I had to show the manager the video. It took a couple of visits to get that ironed out, but they know me well now.</p> <p>That first year, I blew all the cheques in a few months. I\u2019d go with friends and share a big bucket on a Sunday, after a night out. The meals I\u2019m given with my cheques are too much for one person.

      "bodyText": "\u2018When I moved, I had to rent a trailer to take the toilet rolls.\u2019 Frank Cazares, 30, costume designer, Palm Springs, California, US I\u2019ve always been pretty crafty. At school, I could make anything from scraps and, in 2014, an old teacher contacted me with details of a competition running on a bridal blog. Participants were asked to design a wedding dress out of toilet paper. I procrastinated for a long time until, three days before deadline, I decided to go for it. You could use any number of toilet rolls, plus tape, glue or thread. The top 10 designs would be modelled at the finals in New York, and the ultimate winner would get a $10,000 prize. I spent $100 on toilet paper and didn\u2019t sleep for two days. My design was an elaborately constructed off-the-shoulder dress, with fringing and a train of paper roses. It earned me a place in the finals and, while I didn\u2019t win the cash prize, there was a lady from the toilet paper industry on the judging panel who sprang from her seat, applauded wildly and declared my dress worthy of a lifetime supply. It was kind of shocking and unexpected, but everyone laughed and cheered: it was a celebration of my dress. It wasn\u2019t the most glamorous prize but it was at least practical. The toilet rolls started arriving three months later. I was at design school in Orange County and living in a rented room, so my housemates were pretty excited when I got a phone call from UPS saying there was a big order for me to pick up. I pulled up at the depot in my Mini Cooper expecting a large package, and was met by two pallets, piled high with about 20 boxes, containing hundreds of rolls. I couldn\u2019t get it all in the car. I folded the seats down, opened up boxes and shoved packets in every footwell. I was sweating. It was like something out of a movie. This would happen every two or three months; I would receive up to 400 rolls at a time. I\u2019d go to the warehouse, or a haulage truck would pull up outside my house. Storing it was a problem. I made a bedside table out of it, put it under my desk, in my wardrobe and in the garage. Christmas 2014 was the cheapest ever; everyone got toilet roll. At work, I wrapped up an 18-roll pack for our white-elephant game \u2013 a bit like secret Santa \u2013 and everyone fought over it. I gave them out for family birthdays because they were coming so thick and fast, but they sent a mix of qualities and I always kept the more expensive mega rolls, which were softer and more luxurious, for myself. When I moved across state, I had to rent a trailer to take the toilet rolls with me. After about three years, when the deliveries abruptly stopped, I was pretty shocked. I had failed to figure out that my entire lifetime supply had been sent up front \u2013 that was why I had received so much, so often. The company had calculated how many rolls a man my age, living alone, would need for life and delivered them all. I wished then that I hadn\u2019t been so generous, and became more reserved about giving them away. My supply eventually ran out in early 2017: I had blown it in a couple of years. I\u2019m still known as \u201cthe toilet paper guy\u201d. It\u2019s a never-ending joke with my friends and I still get stopped by strangers at the mall. A few weeks ago, it happened at a local restaurant. I chuckle inside every time I have to buy toilet paper at the supermarket; but it hurts a bit, too. Sometimes I take a picture at the checkout and send it to friends. \u2018I thought I\u2019d be eating KFC every day, but I get one bonus bucket a month.\u2019 Lewis Austin, 22, double-glazing salesman, Bridgend When I was 18, I used to watch the YouTuber KSI and at the end of one of his videos he advertised a competition to win 50 years\u2019 worth of free KFC, to celebrate its 50th birthday. I used to eat there fairly often \u2013 not because I loved it, more because I couldn\u2019t be bothered to cook. So I thought, \u201cWhy not?\u201d You had to tell Twitter what you would do to win the prize, and there were all sorts of ridiculous suggestions. It was free to enter, so I had a few goes. The first thing that came into my head was: \u201cI\u2019d eat the hottest chilli in the world.\u201d I put it up there with the hashtag and forgot about it. About three months I was woken by a call from an unknown number at 9am. It was a guy from KFC telling me I\u2019d submitted one of its favourite answers and won. He asked me to go to a branch in Bracknell to film a promotional video with the other winners a few days later. I never thought I\u2019d be on YouTube, but the video is still up there. You can see me eating my ghost chilli. I went for it in one go; at first I didn\u2019t think it was so bad but I quickly started sweating. They gave me a frozen drink to cool me down. There was a guy who bungee jumped, another who was rugby tackled and a woman who got married in the restaurant; there were flowers out and everything. I absolutely loved life that day. I had all these cameras in my face. I felt like I was a big deal, and all my mates were talking about it. I signed my winner\u2019s contract but, if I\u2019m honest, I didn\u2019t read it, so when the prize started to arrive it wasn\u2019t exactly what I had imagined. I thought I\u2019d be eating KFC every day if I wanted, but each year I get a golden chequebook with 12 \u201ccheques\u201d \u2013 one for each month, entitling me to a KFC bonus bucket or a 12-piece sharing bucket. When the first one arrived, in 2015, I headed to a local branch to try it out. They didn\u2019t know what it was and I had to show the manager the video. It took a couple of visits to get that ironed out, but they know me well now. That first year, I blew all the cheques in a few months. I\u2019d go with friends and share a big bucket on a Sunday, after a night out. The meals I\u2019m given with my cheques are too much for one person. It was great for a while, but now the excitement\u2019s worn off. Occasionally someone at work asks if we can get chicken, but sometimes I don\u2019t even get round to claiming my buckets. If I fancy a quick lunch on my own, I just end up paying \u00a36 like everyone else. My mates have always called me chicken, because I run like a chicken, so that\u2019s got another meaning now. My win might not have been what I thought, but I\u2019ve still got buckets full of fried chicken to enjoy till I\u2019m almost 70. \u2018We have a fridge in the garage for my milk, and Dad\u2019s beers.\u2019 Brady Carpenter, 10, schoolboy, Ann Arbor, Michigan, US My family are big University of Michigan football fans and I go to the games with my mom and dad, and sometimes my little brother, JJ, too.

I begin to read an article about a press conference given that afternoon by Donald Trump, even though I watched the press conference in its entirety when I was meant to be working. It was an absolute car crash, and I get a perverse thrill from reliving it. A sharp finger drills into my ribs. \u201cHey!\u201d says a stern voice. \u201cAre you that guy from the Guardian?\u201d I look up to see my sister staring at me. \u201cJesus Christ!\u201d I shout. \u201cYou scared the shit out of me!\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you missed my sign,\u201d I say, holding up the piece of paper, which is now partially crumpled in my balled up fist. \u201cFunny,\u201d she says. \u201cIt would have been hilarious,\u201d I say. I look down and see that she is flanked by two wheeled suitcases. When I try to grab the nearest handle, my sister rolls the suitcase out of my reach, and raises an eyebrow. \u201cTake the bigger one,\u201d she says. In the car park we get stuck behind a man slowly feeding coins into the ticket machine. This, I think, is why I never pick people up at the airport. \u201cMy heart is still pounding,\u201d I say. \u201cYou were so absorbed in whatever,\u201d my sister says. When my turn finally comes I feed my ticket in, followed by my bank card. Nothing happens. I reinsert the card. Nothing happens. \u201cIs there another machine?\u201d my sister says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to retrieve my ticket,\u201d I say. \u201cI guess we live here now.\u201d \u201cThe guy before you used money,\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t got any,\u201d I say. \u201cThis is a disaster.\u201d \u201cHang on,\u201d says my sister. She unzips her bag and reaches in, producing a fat shiny handful of British change.",

The stakes couldn\u2019t have been higher. First impressions? Someone to look up to (in the sense that there was a big height difference); well mannered. What did you talk about? How we\u2019d unknowingly been at the same night out the week before; Burning Man festival; moving to Berlin (not together). Any awkward moments? The waitress asking: \u201cEverything OK with your date?\u201d Or when we realised that we grew up on adjacent roads \u2013 our mums must know each other\u2026 Good table manners? There was a sustained attack on some resilient pork belly with a ramen spoon, but he eventually got there with style and grace. Best thing about Harry? He\u2019s passionate about his job. Would you introduce him to your friends? Sure \u2013 they probably grew up next door to each other as well. Describe Harry in three words. Affable, polite, self-assured. What do you think he made of you? I realised afterwards that I kept repeating \u201cyeah\u201d while he was talking, maybe as a bit of a nervous tic. Did you go on somewhere? For a quick drink at the pub across the road. And... did you kiss? Nope \u2013 a friendly hug farewell. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? Maybe not go to a ramen restaurant \u2013 it\u2019s hard to slurp noodles in a mutually attractive manner. Marks out of 10? 7. Would you meet again? We didn\u2019t swap numbers \u2013 so probably not. Harry on James What were you hoping for? To be struck by Cupid\u2019s dart or consumed by Satan\u2019s lustful flames. First impressions? He\u2019s late! What did you talk about? Heartburn, our nervous waitress, librarians, his alter-ego. Any awkward moments? When a street magician dropped his cards while performing to us. Good table manners? Ramen isn\u2019t the most sensual of dishes. Best thing about James? He\u2019s clearly a kind soul. Would you introduce him to your friends? Perhaps not. Describe James in three words. Not \u201cthe one\u201d. What do you think he made of you? Not \u201cthe one\u201d. Did you go on somewhere? For a final G&amp;T in my favourite pub in Soho, why not? And... did you kiss? Negative (neither tried). If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? To switch the Bunsen burner from safety flame to roaring fire. Marks out of 10? 5. Would you meet again? If I saw him on the tube, I\u2019d smile and wave. He\u2019s not my prince. \u2022 Harry and James ate at Tonkotsu Soho, London. Fancy a blind date?

      "body": "<p>Domestic tyranny was a fact of Victorian life: men who were saintly in public could behave very cruelly behind their front doors. In 1878, close to the end of her life, Catherine Dickens began to confide to her neighbours in Camden, north London, a few details of how her late husband had treated her. Charles was by now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnmeducationcentre/from-the-archive-blog/2017/jun/08/charles-dickens-dies-june-1870\" title=\"\">eight years dead</a>, and the couple had last lived together in 1858, around the time the novelist began his long affair with the young actress <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/09/invisible-woman-mark-kermode-review\" title=\"\">Ellen Ternan</a>.

Naturally the neighbours, Edward Dutton Cook and his wife, were shocked when Catherine told them how Charles had once tried to have her locked up as a madwoman.</p> <p>The crucial evidence, which was disclosed this week, comes in a letter that Cook wrote to a friend and fellow journalist, William Moy Thomas. \u201cHe [Dickens] discovered at last that she had outgrown his liking,\u201d Cook wrote of Catherine\u2019s disclosures. \u201cShe had borne 10 children and had lost many of her good looks, was growing old, in fact. He even tried to shut her up in a lunatic asylum, poor thing! But bad as the law is in regard to proof of insanity he could not quite wrest it to his purpose.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the fact that this letter constituted a communication between the leakiest of vessels, two journalists, its contents remained unknown until the recent discovery by <a href=\"https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2019/research/dickens-letters-asylum/\" title=\"\">Prof John Bowen</a> of a cache of 98 letters at Harvard University. \u201cIt was a moment that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up,\u201d Prof Bowen, of the University of York, said this week. Thanks to Claire Tomalin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/02/charles-dickens-life-tomalin-review\" title=\"\">the biographer</a> of both Dickens and Ternan, we already knew that Dickens\u2019 behaviour was secretive and complicated; but now, if we believe Cook\u2019s letter, we have his wife attesting to a ruthless degree of self-interest. If he could have her declared mad, and she could be confined to an asylum, he could live as he pleased and nobody would think badly of him. A malignant character in one of his novels would have behaved no worse.</p> <p>But the real-life story has a hero. According to Bowen, the doctor who stood in Dickens\u2019 way and refused to certify Catherine\u2019s insanity was most probably Thomas Harrington Tuke, superintendent of Manor House asylum in Chiswick between 1849 and 1888. Tuke and Dickens were friends. They wrote to each other; Dickens attended the christening of Tuke\u2019s son. Then the friendship seems to have turned sour, so that by 1864 Dickens was calling Tuke a \u201cwretched being\u201d and a \u201cmedical donkey\u201d. Bowen speculates, reasonably, that it was Tuke\u2019s refusal to certify Catherine that caused the breach.</p> <p>If so, it was behaviour firmly in the Tuke tradition. The Tukes were Yorkshire Quakers who made a small fortune trading in coffee, chocolate and tea, and spent some of the profits on philanthropy, including support for the campaign to abolish the slave trade. No other family, possibly in the entire history of British medicine, had such a concern for the welfare of the mentally ill, beginning in 1796 when William Tuke opened a Quaker asylum in York called the Retreat. There, patients were treated humanely and compassionately \u2013 the new \u201cmoral treatment\u201d \u2013 in contrast to the brutish methods of the traditional asylums whose inmates were regarded as sub-humans fit only for restraint.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/20/bleak-house-the-dark-truth-behind-charles-dickens-christmas-obsession\">Bleak house: the dark truth behind Charles Dickens' Christmas obsession</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After William Tuke came a succession of Tukes, so many (the Dictionary of National Biography has 20 entries with that surname) that the connection between them can sometimes be hard to establish. In 1866, another of them, John Batty Tuke, was appointed chief physician to the newly opened Fife and Kinross district asylum, near Cupar. As children we knew it by its location, Springfield. A pejorative: \u201cHe\u2019s away tae Springfield\u201d meant someone who was off his head. My great-grandmother Robina Birmingham entered its doors on 29 January 1898 and died there three months later. This week, for the first time, I looked at her entry in the asylum\u2019s Register of Lunatics, where she is described as a female pauper aged 47 whose bodily condition is weak and who suffers from melancholia, which, together with mania and imbecility, is one of the register\u2019s three favourite categories of mental disorder.</p> <p>On whose authority was she sent there? The register lists a Dr Gillespie Esq, sheriff substitute of Dunfermline, but her children always believed that their father, Walter Birmingham, had connived to have his wife put away because she was an inconvenience to his drinking. (He was a drunk, though in the register he masquerades respectably as \u201cChelsea Pensioner\u201d.) She had not been as lucky as Mrs Dickens, but then neither had her husband enjoyed the good fortune of Mr Dickens. Born in County Cork in the famine year of 1848, he enlisted in the Royal Artillery as an 18-year-old and spent most of the next 20 years in India, serving in three Afghan campaigns and spending several jail terms in the garrison cells for desertion. Primary syphilis caught by \u201ccontagion\u201d and treated with \u201cincision\u201d and iodine is entered in his medical records for 1871. Three years later at Ahmedabad camp he married Robina, a Scottish \u201clayer-in\u201d, or midwife, and with her had five children.</p> <p>On his discharge, in 1890, he settled with his wife near her original home in Fife. Various stories have come down to us: that he drove a shunting locomotive at a Fife colliery; alternatively that he drove the knacker\u2019s cart. He never disclosed his birthplace or the Catholic faith he was born into: those have taken his descendants years of on-and-off research. The one securely documented fact is that he died of chronic alcoholism in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary a year after his wife. His last recorded address is Mrs Maver\u2019s lodging house, which was above a pub in Leith.</p> <p>Tomalin, commenting this week on the letters found in the Harvard archive, said an interesting thing: that it was Dickens and not his wife who was the mad one. He had told \u201cstartling lies\u201d about his wife\u2019s condition, but he had fallen in love and his life was a mess: \u201cI think during this period he was mad, effectively, and their lives were thrown into turmoil \u2026 his behaviour for that period when he was determined to separate was shameful and I think he regretted it after.\u201d Perhaps the same could be said of my great-grandfather: that he was not so much bad as driven mad by the privations and cruelties of the Victorian empire, and the routes to oblivion out of it. The 19th century, as Dickens often reminds us, was a brutal place.</p> <p>\u2022 Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Primary syphilis caught by \u201ccontagion\u201d and treated with \u201cincision\u201d and iodine is entered in his medical records for 1871. Three years later at Ahmedabad camp he married Robina, a Scottish \u201clayer-in\u201d, or midwife, and with her had five children. On his discharge, in 1890, he settled with his wife near her original home in Fife. Various stories have come down to us: that he drove a shunting locomotive at a Fife colliery; alternatively that he drove the knacker\u2019s cart. He never disclosed his birthplace or the Catholic faith he was born into: those have taken his descendants years of on-and-off research. The one securely documented fact is that he died of chronic alcoholism in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary a year after his wife. His last recorded address is Mrs Maver\u2019s lodging house, which was above a pub in Leith. Tomalin, commenting this week on the letters found in the Harvard archive, said an interesting thing: that it was Dickens and not his wife who was the mad one. He had told \u201cstartling lies\u201d about his wife\u2019s condition, but he had fallen in love and his life was a mess: \u201cI think during this period he was mad, effectively, and their lives were thrown into turmoil \u2026 his behaviour for that period when he was determined to separate was shameful and I think he regretted it after.\u201d Perhaps the same could be said of my great-grandfather: that he was not so much bad as driven mad by the privations and cruelties of the Victorian empire, and the routes to oblivion out of it. The 19th century, as Dickens often reminds us, was a brutal place. \u2022 Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist",

In the 19th century, one psychologist described being a lone child as \u201ca disease in itself\u201d. The only child is commonly assumed to be lonely, spoiled and incapable of forming healthy relationships. Parents are deemed selfish, failing to provide their child with a daily playmate, denying them the sibling bond, and leaving them alone with their grief once both parents have passed away.</p> <p>And yet recent research paints a different picture. An American study concluded that lone children demonstrated no obvious differences from first-born children in families with siblings. One Chinese study of college-aged students found only children to be more creative and flexible in their thinking.</p> <p>And yet the stereotypes persist. One school mum, in the first week of reception, told me my daughter would probably find it hard to fit in because she had no siblings. (She fitted in just fine.) Another told me I didn\u2019t really understand what it was like being a working mother since I had only one child, in comparison to her three. A third complained my daughter had an academic advantage because I had only one child\u2019s homework to supervise. </p> <p>Whatever is behind the stereotype, only children are demographically on the rise. According to the Office for National Statistics, in 2017 more than half of families had one dependent child, the highest level for more than 80 years. In my daughter\u2019s class, a quarter of the children have no siblings. She is not the odd one out.</p> <p>My daughter is now six and the thought of there being a second child in the house is inconceivable. The three of us fit neatly together. Our daughter is as happy spending time with grownups as she is on play dates. I don\u2019t doubt that there is no such thing as the perfect-sized family: no one-size-fits-all. The only perfect family is the one that loves its children \u2013 however many there are \u2013 deeply, affectionately and unconditionally.

      "bodyText": "Councils have called for licensing powers to tackle \u201clawless\u201d shisha bars that violate laws on smoking and fire safety by allowing smoking indoors and serving under-18s. The Local Government Association (LGA) has been struggling to regulate premises that persistently flout regulations, as prosecutions are slow and owners making high profits are increasingly undeterred by one-off fines of \u00a32,500. Council leaders said part of the problem of tackling shisha bars that break the law is secrecy around the ownership of many premises, limiting the ability of councils and police to take action against them. Secrecy around ownership and ineffective fines mean offenders can easily reopen bars under a new name. The number of shisha bars has trebled in recent years, with more than half of councils now having a bar or cafe in their area. As well as violating smoking regulations, shisha is also often imported illegally and sold without duty. The LGA is calling for an expansion of the activities that councils can license. This would make it easier to vet licence-holders prior to bars opening, monitor premises more effectively and revoke licences for repeat offenders. Simon Blackburn, chair of the LGA\u2019s Safer and Stronger Communities Board, said: \u201cThe growing popularity of shisha bars and the lawless way some of them are being run exposes the loopholes that exist in our outdated and inflexible licensing system. \u201cSmoke-free laws are not offering strong enough punishments to deter irresponsible shisha bar owners who are making lucrative profits, which means councils often need to carry out costly and lengthy investigations to take action against the same bar over and over again.\u201d Rustu Korkmaz, the owner of Double Apple shisha bar in north London, said: \u201cThe councils definitely need to do more to deal with shisha bars that break the law. \u201cThe problem is some of the new bars that have opened in recent years \u2013 they open a bar that goes against regulations, get shut down after a year and then reopen under a different name or in a different area. They are in it to make quick profits. \u201cIn recent years several shisha bars have opened in my area \u2013 there are three just across the street. I opened my bar in 2011 and I\u2019ve never had problems because I\u2019ve always followed regulations \u2013 we pay duties, have no smoking indoors and ID anyone who looks under 25.\u201d Licensing powers could also allow local public health teams to work with owners to ensure customers are aware of the risks associated with shisha, specifically the misconception that it is less harmful than cigarette smoke. The British Heart Foundation advises that shisha tobacco contains cigarette tobacco and therefore nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide and heavy metals such as arsenic and lead.

As well as the glitzy nominees, presenters will include Barbra Streisand, Helen Mirren, Michael Keaton, Daniel Craig, Whoopi Goldberg, Jennifer Lopez, Charlize Theron and Serena Williams. But it was a sigh of relief, rather than a starstruck gasp, which met the confirmation on Thursday of another guest. An Academy Awards press release assured us that Hollywood\u2019s \u201cofficial doc\u201d, Dr George Gauthier, will \u201csupply emergency and stress care for the celebrity attendees, able to do more on site than EMT [emergency medical technicians] and mainstream medical doctors\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2019/feb/21/and-the-oscar-for-most-self-satirising-ceremony-goes-to\">And the Oscar for most self-satirising ceremony goes to \u2026</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although one hopes more medics may be available (the theatre seats 3,300, and there\u2019s 600 crew), this is good news. Gauthier has apparently been so essential over his 20-year tenure, veteran producer Dick Clark declared: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have an event without him!\u201d Even if you\u2019re not feeling peaky, it might be worth faking a dicky hip during a boring bit. Says Gauthier\u2019s website: \u201cCurrently 98% of his clinic\u2019s patients heal substantially beyond their satisfaction.\u201d Go in with a limp, come out with a new kidney. If there\u2019s anything the Oscars need right now, it\u2019s a doctor. Recalling its recent history triggers hives. The phrase \u201cnervous breakdown\u201d came all too readily to the lips of its producer last week after the order came to once again retool the ceremony \u2013 this time to reverse a decision to relegate the awarding of minor prizes to the time during TV ad breaks.</p> <p>It\u2019s the fifth big capitulation since last year\u2019s awards, with reverse-ferrets on plans to introduce a popular film category, to bin some original-song performances, to stop previous winners presenting key awards and to hire a homophobic host. This after their nerves were already shot by Faye Dunaway <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2017/feb/27/oscars-shock-la-la-land-mistakenly-named-best-picture-video\" title=\"\">announcing the wrong film</a> as best picture winner in 2017 \u2013 not to mention a constant fight to persuade the public their members aren\u2019t unshakably sexist, old and racist.</p> <p>This year, the eggshells are too thickly strewn across the red carpet to miss. No wonder those goodie bags are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/22/oscars-gift-bags-2019\" title=\"\">rammed with cannabis</a>: make one off-colour comment and your career is toast.

Oscar winners are getting older, analysis reveals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For a film, as well as a figure, to survive current conditions, a social message is compulsory. A Star is Born was considered a shoo-in for best picture <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/31/a-star-is-born-review-lady-gaga-bradley-cooper\" title=\"\">six months ago</a>. Now it has no chance, for it cannot be tethered to a political bandwagon. It\u2019s an insular story about the fabulousness of showbiz \u2013 a subject that would, until recently, have been catnip to the Academy, but is insufficient today. You need confidence to celebrate yourself so explicitly, and the Oscars are a gibbering mess. The film that will win, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/\" title=\"\">Roma</a>, acquits Oscar voters on artistic grounds: foreign-language, black and white, long and resolutely unsexy. It is just political enough: set in a country under attack by Trump, sympathetic to a class and ethnicity of domestic workers to whom white Californian artistic types could feel especially indebted. That it is also the best film on the list is coincidental.</p> <p>With or without the ministrations of Dr Gauthier, Hollywood will survive Sundaynight. The dust will settle and the trauma will fade. And if not, that goodie bag also includes therapy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The guest list for Sunday night\u2019s Oscars reads like Steven Spielberg\u2019s Rolodex. As well as the glitzy nominees, presenters will include Barbra Streisand, Helen Mirren, Michael Keaton, Daniel Craig, Whoopi Goldberg, Jennifer Lopez, Charlize Theron and Serena Williams. But it was a sigh of relief, rather than a starstruck gasp, which met the confirmation on Thursday of another guest. An Academy Awards press release assured us that Hollywood\u2019s \u201cofficial doc\u201d, Dr George Gauthier, will \u201csupply emergency and stress care for the celebrity attendees, able to do more on site than EMT [emergency medical technicians] and mainstream medical doctors\u201d. Although one hopes more medics may be available (the theatre seats 3,300, and there\u2019s 600 crew), this is good news. Gauthier has apparently been so essential over his 20-year tenure, veteran producer Dick Clark declared: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have an event without him!\u201d Even if you\u2019re not feeling peaky, it might be worth faking a dicky hip during a boring bit. Says Gauthier\u2019s website: \u201cCurrently 98% of his clinic\u2019s patients heal substantially beyond their satisfaction.\u201d Go in with a limp, come out with a new kidney. If there\u2019s anything the Oscars need right now, it\u2019s a doctor. Recalling its recent history triggers hives. The phrase \u201cnervous breakdown\u201d came all too readily to the lips of its producer last week after the order came to once again retool the ceremony \u2013 this time to reverse a decision to relegate the awarding of minor prizes to the time during TV ad breaks. It\u2019s the fifth big capitulation since last year\u2019s awards, with reverse-ferrets on plans to introduce a popular film category, to bin some original-song performances, to stop previous winners presenting key awards and to hire a homophobic host. This after their nerves were already shot by Faye Dunaway announcing the wrong film as best picture winner in 2017 \u2013 not to mention a constant fight to persuade the public their members aren\u2019t unshakably sexist, old and racist. This year, the eggshells are too thickly strewn across the red carpet to miss. No wonder those goodie bags are rammed with cannabis: make one off-colour comment and your career is toast. So heightened is the anxiety that the Academy opted not to replace Kevin Hart as host, perhaps figuring a rest is safer than a change. For a film, as well as a figure, to survive current conditions, a social message is compulsory. A Star is Born was considered a shoo-in for best picture six months ago. Now it has no chance, for it cannot be tethered to a political bandwagon. It\u2019s an insular story about the fabulousness of showbiz \u2013 a subject that would, until recently, have been catnip to the Academy, but is insufficient today. You need confidence to celebrate yourself so explicitly, and the Oscars are a gibbering mess. The film that will win, Roma, acquits Oscar voters on artistic grounds: foreign-language, black and white, long and resolutely unsexy. It is just political enough: set in a country under attack by Trump, sympathetic to a class and ethnicity of domestic workers to whom white Californian artistic types could feel especially indebted. That it is also the best film on the list is coincidental. With or without the ministrations of Dr Gauthier, Hollywood will survive Sundaynight. The dust will settle and the trauma will fade. And if not, that goodie bag also includes therapy.",

The storm, twice the diameter of 2017\u2019s deadly cyclone Debbie, was tracking south towards Lord Howe Island but was predicted to turn and head north again. The Bureau of Meteorology said it was unpredictable but could re-intensify to category two as it sat about 800km off the coast of Brisbane. The storm was moving slowly southeast on Saturday evening, and was expected to continue to bring abnormally high tides, damaging winds and large swells, causing beach erosion, and coinciding with king tides. Ann Farrell, the New South Wales state manager for the Bureau of Meteorology, said they expected coastal inundation in low-lying parts of the affected areas. The bureau warned of waves exceeding five metres between Coffs Harbour and the Queensland border. Wave heightsof up to 10 metres were recorded offshore at Byron Bay on Saturday. A hazardous surf warning was in place for Saturday and Sunday for Fraser Island Coast, Sunshine Coast Waters, Moreton Bay and Gold Coast Waters. Cape Byron received wind gusts of 95km/h on Saturday morning, as did Moreton Island, north-east of Brisbane. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, urged people on Friday not to go out into the surf, saying authorities were monitoring the storm and warning of the hazardous conditions on the beaches despite it getting weaker. Phil Ayres, chief operating officer of Surf Life Saving NSW, said: \u201cThe message for beachgoers and locals is that if the flags are down, it\u2019s not safe to swim.\u201d Between Noosa and Mooloolaba, lifesavers rescued 43 surfers on Thursday, the ABC reported. All Gold Coast beaches remained closed for swimming on Saturday, but the big waves lured surfers to take to the water in droves. Mooloolaba received an offshore swell of up to 13 metres on Friday, and Coastalwatch crowed over a video of Kirra Beach showing Mick Fanning, Joel Parkinson, Mitch Parkinson and \u201cmany more core lords getting mega slotted\u201d. Noosa has \u201cepic, perfect lines\u201d, Coastalwatch said, but the site\u2019s chief forecaster, Ben Macartney, warned that the potentially \u201chistoric event\u201d for Queensland\u2019s beaches included the capacity for large-scale erosion. The big swell was expected to travel down the coast \u2013 Sydney was forecast to receive two-metre waves by Sunday, but surfing conditions were likely to be hampered by offshore winds. As Oma eased and moved away from the Queensland coast, the threat of increased fires also reduced. The high fire-risk areas inland \u2013 which have received little rain in recent times \u2013 were not expected to have strong winds.

      "body": "<p>Along the single icy road leading through the village of Kuri, high in the hills of eastern Nepal, tourists stop to stare at a pair of skis. \u201cIs it a skateboard?\u201d asks one. \u201cMaybe they are ice skates,\u201d suggests another. \u201cNo idea,\u201d they agree, before walking off gingerly along the slippery track.</p> <p>Nepal may have the highest mountains in the world, but you are about as likely to see a skier here as you are a yeti. Nepal sent no athletes to the Winter Olympics last year, and there is not a single ski resort in the country.</p> <p>All that is set to change, if a group of young Nepalese entrepreneurs get their way. Shacked up in a tiny hotel in the village, members of the <a href=\"https://www.nfssnepal.org/\">Ski and Snowboarding Foundation Nepal</a> are on a mission to build the country\u2019s first ski resort in Kuri.</p> <p>\u201cWe are starting with one slope but we want to build a ski resort, with a gondola from Europe and a snow machine,\u201d says Utsav Pathak, 24, the foundation\u2019s president.</p> <p>They have a long way to go. All that exists at present is a gentle 50-metre slope and a stunning view. This year the foundation built Nepal\u2019s first ski lift, a homemade contraption consisting of a generator and a collection of wheels and levers, but it stands unused at the top of the slope. \u201cIt stopped working because it was too cold,\u201d says Pathak.</p> <p>At the top of a slope, a group of beginners gather nervously. \u201cIt\u2019s all about balance,\u201d shouts the instructor. \u201cBalance is my worst quality,\u201d replies one woman as she slides away unsteadily down the slope before collapsing in a heap.</p> <p>Pathak and his team are undeterred by the challenges. In the past three years, they claim to have given a thousand Nepalis a taste of skiing. The second national ski and snowboard championships was held this month and an embryonic ski touring and heli-ski industry has emerged.</p> <p>Pathak has chosen a good spot to launch his ski venture. Kuri, in the rural municipality of Kalinchowk, can be reached in a day from the capital, Kathmandu. \u201cPeople think skiing is time consuming and very expensive, but in Kuri they can come to ski quickly and cheaply,\u201d says local hotelier, Bijay Shrestha.</p> <p>Kuri is already a popular tourist destination. On a ridge high above the village sits a revered temple, which attracts thousands of worshippers each weekend. Three months ago, a cable car was built to ferry pilgrims to the top, boosting tourist numbers further.</p> <p>Others come to get a rare taste of snow and have fun. In the evenings, they gather around campfires \u2013 there is no indoor heating \u2013 to drink and dance to unrelenting Nepalese pop songs. \u201cWe are here to enjoy,\u201d shouts one tipsy visitor as he heads off, struggling to stay upright on an icy path.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"608755799a470cf40b3af6636de09496261825df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/608755799a470cf40b3af6636de09496261825df/0_158_2596_1572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Nepalese village of Kuri, overlooked by the peaks of Gaurishankar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"606\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passage to the Nepalese village of Kuri, overlooked by the peaks of Gaurishankar, involves negotiating a hazardous mountain track.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Pattisson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But few tourists have come to ski.

      "bodyText": "Along the single icy road leading through the village of Kuri, high in the hills of eastern Nepal, tourists stop to stare at a pair of skis. \u201cIs it a skateboard?\u201d asks one. \u201cMaybe they are ice skates,\u201d suggests another. \u201cNo idea,\u201d they agree, before walking off gingerly along the slippery track. Nepal may have the highest mountains in the world, but you are about as likely to see a skier here as you are a yeti. Nepal sent no athletes to the Winter Olympics last year, and there is not a single ski resort in the country. All that is set to change, if a group of young Nepalese entrepreneurs get their way. Shacked up in a tiny hotel in the village, members of the Ski and Snowboarding Foundation Nepal are on a mission to build the country\u2019s first ski resort in Kuri. \u201cWe are starting with one slope but we want to build a ski resort, with a gondola from Europe and a snow machine,\u201d says Utsav Pathak, 24, the foundation\u2019s president. They have a long way to go. All that exists at present is a gentle 50-metre slope and a stunning view. This year the foundation built Nepal\u2019s first ski lift, a homemade contraption consisting of a generator and a collection of wheels and levers, but it stands unused at the top of the slope. \u201cIt stopped working because it was too cold,\u201d says Pathak. At the top of a slope, a group of beginners gather nervously. \u201cIt\u2019s all about balance,\u201d shouts the instructor. \u201cBalance is my worst quality,\u201d replies one woman as she slides away unsteadily down the slope before collapsing in a heap. Pathak and his team are undeterred by the challenges. In the past three years, they claim to have given a thousand Nepalis a taste of skiing. The second national ski and snowboard championships was held this month and an embryonic ski touring and heli-ski industry has emerged. Pathak has chosen a good spot to launch his ski venture. Kuri, in the rural municipality of Kalinchowk, can be reached in a day from the capital, Kathmandu. \u201cPeople think skiing is time consuming and very expensive, but in Kuri they can come to ski quickly and cheaply,\u201d says local hotelier, Bijay Shrestha. Kuri is already a popular tourist destination. On a ridge high above the village sits a revered temple, which attracts thousands of worshippers each weekend. Three months ago, a cable car was built to ferry pilgrims to the top, boosting tourist numbers further. Others come to get a rare taste of snow and have fun. In the evenings, they gather around campfires \u2013 there is no indoor heating \u2013 to drink and dance to unrelenting Nepalese pop songs. \u201cWe are here to enjoy,\u201d shouts one tipsy visitor as he heads off, struggling to stay upright on an icy path. But few tourists have come to ski. An hour on the slope costs \u00a310, which visitor Hemant Budhatoki thinks is too expensive. \u201cWe can\u2019t do it because of our economic condition,\u201d he says. Jhuma Thapa, who works in one of the local hotels, has never skied. \u201cI\u2019m too afraid,\u201d he explains. Another hotel worker, Ram Kumar Khadka, walks past the ski lift but has no idea what it is. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in skiing,\u201d he says. Lack of interest is not the only problem facing Pathak and his team. The only way to reach Kuri is up a treacherous 20km mountain track, which in winter has to be navigated by four-wheel drive jeeps that slip and slide their way to the top. The roadside is dotted with abandoned vehicles that have got stuck in the slush and mud. The number of hotels in the village has soared in the past two years, but the only source of water is a small stream, so locals have turned to melting snow or ferrying water up from the valley in trucks that inevitably get stuck en route. The service culture has not kept up with the building. \u201cSome people who run the hotels are not so interested in hospitality because they know that whatever they do, people will come to visit the temple,\u201d says Pathak. The visitors are almost exclusively Nepalese. A rare group of Chinese tourists give the place a mixed review. \u201cIt\u2019s cool. It\u2019s awesome \u2026 but if you want to attract more foreign tourists you need to improve the road and provide wifi,\u201d says one, who goes by the name Giovanni. The challenges of establishing a ski resort in Kuri are repeated across the country: inaccessible snow, poor infrastructure and a lack of government support. \u201cGeography holds us back. Apart from Kuri, the snowy places are far from Kathmandu. They are out of reach and expensive to get to. If they were easily accessible, Nepalese people would not hesitate to go skiing,\u201d says Anil Upreti, another member of the foundation. Local and central government have shown little interest in supporting the development of skiing, says Pathak. \u201cTo be honest, the authorities have not been so helpful. We have asked them for funds, but it takes so long, the season finishes before anything is agreed.\u201d Deepak Joshi, head of the Nepal Tourism Board, says the potential for skiing in Nepal is huge. Nonetheless, he cannot point to any examples where his organisation has supported the sport\u2019s growth. \u201cIt is a totally untapped and unexplored area, but once some activities have started we will be very happy to promote them,\u201d he says. Shrestha, for one, remains optimistic. \u201cSkiing is a new idea in Nepal. But it will become a popular place to ski. Slowly the ski craze will come. For sure.\u201d",

The presidents of Chile, Colombia and Paraguay all came to the concert on Friday.</p> <p>On Saturday the opposition will test whether he can transfer a wave of popular support and international recognition into political power, by attempting to bring aid across the border into Venezuela.</p> <p>\u201cThe humanitarian aid won\u2019t solve all of Venezuela\u2019s problems,\u201d said Villka Fernandez, a concert organiser and former political prisoner. \u201cBut it signals the end of the regime of Maduro and his criminal cronies.\u201d</p> <p>Maduro has called the planned deliveries a \u201cprovocation\u201d, barred them from entering the country, and claimed relief supplies are coming from Russia instead.</p> <p>He has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/21/nicolas-maduro-venezuela-brazil-border-closure\"> blocked the border with Brazil</a> and the maritime border with several islands, as well as ordering military and police units to reinforce crossings with Colombia.</p> <p>He had responded to the international show of support for Guaido in Colombia by promising a concert of his own on Friday, but it started late and drew a crowd of just a few thousand, many of them bussed in from surrounding towns to watch a show that included uniformed military dancers.</p> <p>Both concerts was held on the Tienditas bridge connecting Colombia and Venezuela, on a temporary stage in front of containers and an oil truck Venezuelan government forces used to blockade the crossing.</p> <p>On the Colombian side, a campsite had been set up near the concert site, for volunteers to spend the night before trying to take the aid across.</p> <p>\u201cTomorrow is the day we\u2019ve all been waiting for.

      "bodyText": "The US has condemned Venezuela\u2019s military after soldiers shot dead two people and injured 15 others trying to keep the country\u2019s border with Brazil open for aid deliveries. The White House warned in a statement: \u201cEgregious violation of human rights by [President Nicol\u00e1s] Maduro and those who are following his orders will not go unpunished.\u201d The US also urged the armed forces to allow humanitarian aid to pass peacefully into the country, the day before supporters of presidential challenger Juan Guaid\u00f3 plan to challenge the authority of Caracas by trying to ship food and medical donations into the country. On Friday evening, Guaid\u00f3 defied a government travel ban to appear at a star-studded aid concert inside the Colombia border, drawing the biggest cheers of the evening, even after hours of performances from musicians including Maluma, Alejandro Sanz and Luis Fonsi, famous for the global hit Despacito. He did not take to the stage, perhaps because the concert was billed as a non-political, humanitarian fundraiser, that backers compared to the 1985 Live Aid event. But the big screens showed him in the crowd, and when the floodlights came up after a final rendition of John Lennon\u2019s hit Imagine the thousands-strong audience began chanting \u201cyes he can\u201d in Spanish. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he came,\u201d said Nancy Salinas, who had crossed from the Venezuelan city of San Antonio to attend. \u201cHe cares about us, unlike the tyrant [President Nicol\u00e1s] Maduro.\u201d Guaid\u00f3\u2019s appearance was both a surprise and a show of power, because Venezuelan authorities had barred him from leaving the country after he declared himself \u201cinterim president\u201d in January, claiming Maduro\u2019s election was voided by fraud. Amid the rising tensions, US national security adviser John Bolton announced on Friday evening that he had cancelled a planned trip to South Korea to focus on events in Venezuela. Since Guaid\u00f3\u2019s declaration, he has been recognised as the country\u2019s rightful leader by more than 50 countries, including the United States and many regional powers. The presidents of Chile, Colombia and Paraguay all came to the concert on Friday. On Saturday the opposition will test whether he can transfer a wave of popular support and international recognition into political power, by attempting to bring aid across the border into Venezuela. \u201cThe humanitarian aid won\u2019t solve all of Venezuela\u2019s problems,\u201d said Villka Fernandez, a concert organiser and former political prisoner. \u201cBut it signals the end of the regime of Maduro and his criminal cronies.\u201d Maduro has called the planned deliveries a \u201cprovocation\u201d, barred them from entering the country, and claimed relief supplies are coming from Russia instead. He has blocked the border with Brazil and the maritime border with several islands, as well as ordering military and police units to reinforce crossings with Colombia. He had responded to the international show of support for Guaido in Colombia by promising a concert of his own on Friday, but it started late and drew a crowd of just a few thousand, many of them bussed in from surrounding towns to watch a show that included uniformed military dancers. Both concerts was held on the Tienditas bridge connecting Colombia and Venezuela, on a temporary stage in front of containers and an oil truck Venezuelan government forces used to blockade the crossing. On the Colombian side, a campsite had been set up near the concert site, for volunteers to spend the night before trying to take the aid across. \u201cTomorrow is the day we\u2019ve all been waiting for. Tomorrow is the day we can go home,\u201d said Eduardo Espinel, who has lived in Cucuta for three years, and runs a foundation for Venezuelan migrants. Guaid\u00f3, of the Popular Will party, has re-energised an opposition that was fractured and ineffective for years. By promising aid deliveries, he found a powerful way to channel discontent with the government into political action. Venezuelans face widespread hunger and medicine shortages, and hyper-inflation running at around 2 million percent a year has made salaries virtually worthless. As the country\u2019s economic crisis deepened, more than one in ten have fled abroad. The security forces have so far largely stood by Maduro, despite opposition efforts to win them over including offers of an amnesty, but their loyalties may be tested if large numbers of civilian volunteers try to import much-needed aid in defiance of the ban. Video shared by opposition figures heading to the border in a \u201ccaravan\u201d from Caracas appeared to show armed national guard members at barricades were barely resisting when crowds pushed them aside so that buses could pass. In a political boost for the opposition, Chavez\u2019s former spy chief turned against Maduro this week, denouncing him as dictator and calling for aid to pass. But the security forces are likely to be under strict orders to bar aid regardless of who carries it, and with elite units stationed along the Colombian border, there are worries any showdown could end in bloodshed. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see a situation this weekend that avoids the military stopping that aid from coming in,\u201d said Roc\u00edo San Miguel, a Caracas-based defence analyst. \u201cThe military structures towards that border make it impossible that they will let that aid through.\u201d On the Colombian border, opposition supporters desperate for change said they were undeterred by the threat of violence. \u201cThis is a dictatorship that has already taken everything from us, our food, our homes, our medicines,\u201d said Rafael Alfonzo Silva, who had come to assist with logistics, having fled Venezuela two years ago. \u201cThey have nothing left to take.\u201d Despite bellicose threats to the existing regime from American officials, including Donald Trump, Guaid\u00f3 and his supporters have insisted they do not want a foreign military intervention or violence on the ground. \u201cWe are not talking about an intervention like the ones you see in films, with helicopters and planes landing,\u201d said Dignora Hern\u00e1ndez, a legislator from the Vente Venezuela opposition party, who had also travelled to the border. \u201cwe are talking about authorising \u2013 according to the constitution \u2013 a peaceful mission to allow humanitarian aid to pass.\u201d Apart from the campsites near the concert site, details of how and where the opposition will try to breach the border are still unclear. Although much of the media focus has been on the Colombian border, where flows of migrants are high and the two planned concerts have drawn international attention, aid has been stockpiled in several other locations including the border with Brazil and the island of Cura\u00e7ao. A ship loaded with supplies is also sailing from Puerto Rico.",

Earlier in the day, the R&amp;B star had been charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse in Illinois for incidents dating back as far as May 1998. Numerous women have accused Kelly, 52, of sexual abuse over the past 20 years but he has only appeared before a judge once. The new charges, filed in Cook county, include nine counts of sexual abuse of three victims aged between 13 and 17, according to court documents seen by the Guardian. The 10th count did not specify the age of the fourth victim. The singer, born Robert Kelly, is expected to appear in court for a bond hearing on Saturday, said the Cook county state\u2019s attorney, Kim Foxx. Kelly, who was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008, has consistently denied any sexual misconduct. \u201cHe is extraordinarily disappointed and depressed. He is shellshocked by this,\u201d Steve Greenberg, Kelly\u2019s attorney, said. The charging documents describe contact between Kelly\u2019s penis and the mouths, sex organs and breasts of victims aged 13 to 17. The incidents occurred between May 1998 to May 1999; September 1998 to September 2001; May 2009 to January 2010; and in February 2003. Multiple women have accused Kelly of violent and controlling behavior, including allegations he had sex with girls as young as 14 and brainwashed young women in what their parents described as a \u201ccult\u201d. A recently aired documentary, Surviving R Kelly, featured testimony from some of these women and prompted new investigations. On Thursday, two additional women came forward to accuse Kelly of sexual abuse. The women, Latresa Scaff and Rochelle Washington, said they were teenagers in Baltimore, Maryland, when Kelly brought them back to his hotel after a concert, exposed himself to them and had sex with Scaff, who was under the influence of alcohol and marijuana. The women said they never saw or heard from Kelly again after they left the hotel. Kelly has previously denied wrongdoing. He recorded a song last year professing his innocence, singing: \u201cI\u2019m so falsely accused.\u201d In 2008, he appeared before a judge after being accused of making child abuse images by filming sexual encounters, including one in which he allegedly urinated over an underage girl.

      "bodyText": "Documents posted online Friday appear to be confidential internal Facebook communications that reveal new details of the company\u2019s treatment of user data. About 60 pages of un-redacted exhibits from a lawsuit between Facebook and Six4Three, an app developer, were posted anonymously on GitHub on Friday. They include emails between various Facebook executives, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and a \u201chighly confidential\u201d 2012 memo detailing various policy matters. The Guardian has not been able to independently confirm the authenticity of the documents, but redacted versions of some of the exhibits have been previously published. \u201cLike the other documents that were cherrypicked and released in violation of a court order last year, these by design tell one side of a story and omit important context,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cAs we\u2019ve said, these selective leaks came from a lawsuit where Six4Three, the creators of an app known as Pikinis, hoped to force Facebook to share information on friends of the app\u2019s users. These documents have been sealed by a Californian court so we\u2019re not able to discuss them in detail.\u201d The new cache of emails appears to refer to what could have been a catastrophic privacy breach for Facebook: a near-miss situation in which a third-party app could have disclosed the company\u2019s financial results ahead of schedule. In an email thread, the former Facebook vice-president Michael Vernal refers to some kind of issue with an app, noting that it \u201ccould have been near-fatal for Facebook Platform / Login / etc\u201d. \u201cWow that would have been a disaster,\u201d responds Avichal Garg, a former director of product management at Facebook. \u201cIf Mark had accidentally disclosed earnings ahead of time because a platform app violated his privacy \u2026 literally, that would have basically been fatal for Login / Open Graph / etc,\u201d Vernal responded. He went on to urge everyone on the thread to keep the incident confidential, writing: \u201cListen guys/gals \u2013 DO NOT REPEAT THIS STORY OFF OF THIS THREAD.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m super, super serious here. I want us to follow-up on this and respond urgently here, but I also do not want this story spreading inside of Facebook or off of this thread at all. I can\u2019t tell you how terrible this would have been for all of us had this not been caught quickly.\u201d The sealed court dockets have been at the center of a transatlantic controversy since November, when they were obtained by the UK parliament under extraordinary circumstances. Produced by Facebook during the discovery process of a 2015 lawsuit filed by Six4Three, the documents were sealed by the California state judge overseeing the case. When Six4Three founder Ted Kramer was in London in 2018, however, he provided them to Damian Collins, the chair of the parliamentary committee that was investigating Facebook, after Collins told Kramer that failure to do put him in \u201ccontempt of parliament\u201d. How Kramer came to have access to the documents in the first place, and whether he should have provided them to Collins while in the UK despite the court order, were the subject of considerable opprobrium by the California court \u2013 and by Facebook. Collins, whose digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) committee published the results of its inquiry into fake news and disinformation on Monday, released a redacted selection of the documents he had obtained in December. Another of the newly exposed documents appears to be a July 2012 memo from Marne Levine, who at the time was Facebook\u2019s vice-president global public policy. The eight-page memo, marked \u201chighly confidential\u201d, offers a fascinating look inside the company\u2019s policy maneuvers.

      "bodyText": "As we head into the weekend: Democratic presidential candidate Senator Amy Klobuchar continues to face scrutiny over \u201cdehumanizing\u201d treatment of her staffers, with new details in reports from the New York Times and the Huffington Post. On climate change: Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein is facing criticism for her response to a group of young activists who wanted her to vote yes on the Green New Deal. Also, Donald Trump announced his pick for his new UN ambassador: a diplomat who, when asked recently if she believed in climate change, said: \u201c I appreciate and respect both sides.\u201d Trump\u2019s most famous \u201cboth sides\u201d moment came when he praised the \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d of the deadly neo-Nazi rallies in Charlottesville, Virginia. Today, told reporters that he does not believe his rhetoric played any role in inspiring a neo-Nazi coast guard officer was accused of planning an act of domestic terrorism. Federal prosecutors said the man had assembled a list of targets, including prominent Democrats and media figures. \u201cI think my language is very nice,\u201d Trump said. Mueller watch: the special counsel\u2019s reporter will, in fact, not be out next week, according to the latest reports. The chairs of six House committees wrote to Attorney General Bill Barr today saying that they expect the report to be made public. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer, met with federal prosecutors in New York last month to offer information about \u201cpossible irregularities within the president\u2019s family business\u201d, the New York Times reports. R Kelly has been charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse for incidents dating back as far as May 1998. Sign up for our morning briefing for a global perspective on the US. We\u2019ll email you a summary of the day\u2019s top stories and must-reads. Subscribe now. Since the Minnesota senator launched her campaign for president on February 10, a series of articles have examined Amy Klobuchar\u2019s treatment of her employees. \u201cThe way she treats staff is disqualifying,\u201d an anonymous former staffer for senator Amy Klobuchar told a reporter earlier this month. Klobuchar has defended herself as a \u201ctough boss\u201d with \u201chigh expectations.\u201d The latest: Klobuchar \u201cis well known on Capitol Hill for calling prospective employers in an attempt to shut new job opportunities down,\u201d Huffington Post reports, providing new details about a habit first described by aides to Yahoo News. \u201cIn one instance, Klobuchar went so far as to confront a fellow Democrat in Congress who had offered a job to one of Klobuchar\u2019s staffers, making it clear she wanted the offer rescinded,\u201d Huffington Post reports. \u201cOne former employee said that when she was looking for a new job, she warned potential employers that Klobuchar might seek a way to sabotage her prospects.\u201d Klobuchar, who has reportedly has thrown objects, including binders and phones, \u201cin the direction\u201d of her staffers, has one of the highest staff turnover rates in the Senate. Reactions to Sen. Feinstein\u2019s sharp exchange with young activists over the Green New Deal are continuing to roll in. Here\u2019s a reaction from a former Obama spokesman and host of Pod Save America, the influential liberal podcast: \u201cWe are officially living in a gerontocracy,\u201d Charlotte Alter, a national correspondent for Time Magazine, wrote. Alter notes that Feinstein was born in 1933, \u201cin the early days of the original New Deal.\u201d Now the 85-year-old senator is opposing \u201ca bold plan to give them the same types of protections she grew up with.\u201d Donald Trump is nominating Kelly Knight Craft to be the United States\u2019 ambassador to the United Nations. Knight is currently the US\u2019 ambassador to Canada. In December 2018, Knight Craft made headlines about a key UN concern when she was asked in a television interview: \u201cDo you believe in climate change?\u201d She answered: \u201cI believe there are scientists on both sides that are accurate.\u201d Asked if she believed \u201cthere is science that proves that man is not causing climate change\u201d, she said: \u201cWell, I think that both sides have, you know, their own results from their studies, and I appreciate and respect both sides of the science.\u201d Knight Craft, who has donated to the Republican party, is married to Joseph Kraft, a billionaire coal magnate from Kentucky. The president\u2019s announcement comes a week after Trump\u2019s first choice to replace Nikki Haley at the UN, former Fox News host and state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, withdrew her candidacy. California senator Dianne Feinstein is facing criticism over a video of her response to a group of children and teenagers asking her to support the \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d The video clip shows part of a Friday morning meeting between Feinstein and young activists from the Sunrise Movement. Founded in 2017, the group organizes young people to fight climate change and support the Green New Deal. When Feinstein pushed back on the young activists\u2019 request, one child says, \u201cThe government is supposed to be for the people, by the people, and all for the people.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 30 years. I know what I\u2019ve been doing,\u201d Feinstein responds in the video. \u201cYou come in here and say it has to be my way or the highway. I\u2019ve gotten elected. I just ran. I was elected by almost a million vote plurality and I know what I\u2019m doing. Maybe people should listen a little bit.\u201d \u201cI hear what you\u2019re saying,\u201d a teenage activist says. \u201cBut we\u2019re the people who voted you, you\u2019re supposed to listen to us.\u201d \u201cHow old are you?\u201d Feinstein asks her. \u201cI\u2019m sixteen,\u201d the young woman responds. \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t vote for me,\u201d Feinstein says. Feinstein\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The senator reacted \u201cwith smugness + disrespect,\u201d the Sunrise Movement tweeted on Friday, sharing a video clip of the meeting. \u201cHer reaction is why young people desperately want new leadership in Congress.\u201d Later in the clip, Feinstein tells a young activist, \u201cWell, you know better than I do. So I think one day you should run for the United States Senate and then you do it your way.\u201d \u201cGreat, I will,\u201d the teenager responded. The Green New Deal, a proposal that aims to fight inequality and tackle climate change at the same time, is being advanced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, among other Democratic lawmakers. Want more details? Here\u2019s our explainer on the Green New Deal. The proposal could face a vote in the senate as early as next week. \u201cThat resolution will not pass the Senate,\u201d Feinstein told the activists, according to a press release from the Sunrise Movement. \u201cAnd you can take that back to whoever sent you here.\u201d Need a break from political news? It\u2019s the Friday before the Oscars, and Vanity Fair has reportedly disinvited the New York Times from its storied Oscars party. The Times Style section ran a critical story yesterday questioning whether Vanity Fair\u2019s annual party was still the \u201chottest\u201d Oscars event. The magazine was apparently unhappy with the coverage, Choire Sicha, the editor of the Times Style section, noted. Lois Beckett here, taking over our live coverage. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer, met with federal prosecutors in New York last month to offer information about \u201cpossible irregularities within the president\u2019s family business\u201d, the New York Times reports. The conversation involved \u201cinsurance claims the company had filed over the years\u201d, the Times reported, and there was \u201cno indication\u201d that President Trump was implicated in the \u201cirregularities.\u201d Donald Trump tried to change the subject when asked about a North Carolina election invalidated because of absentee ballot fraud, instead pointing to other questionable allegations of voter fraud. The state board of elections has ordered a new election for a House seat after an operative working for the Republican candidate, Mark Harris, was found to have run an illegal absentee ballot harvesting operation. \u201cI condemn any voter fraud of any kind, whether it\u2019s Democrat or Republican,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, Politico reports. \u201cBut when you look at some of the things that happened in California in particular, when you look at what has happened in Texas with all of those votes that they recently found that were not exactly properly done. I condemn all of it.\u201d A reporter attempted to point out the cases he was referring to were unsubstantiated. \u201cI condemn all of it. And that includes North Carolina if anything \u2014 I guess they\u2019re going to be doing a final report. But I\u2019d like to see the final report. Any form of election fraud, I condemn,\u201d he said. Trump has repeatedly made false allegations of mass voter fraud in the 2016 election, blaming it for his loss of the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello says Donald Trump is refusing to meet with him to discuss Hurricane Maria relief. He told the Associated Press that the White House declined public and private requests to meet ahead of a governors\u2019 conference in Washington this weekend to discuss the response to the storm, which has drawn heavy criticism. Donald Trump said he doesn\u2019t believe a resolution to block his border emergency declaration can survive his veto. \u201cWill I veto it? One hundred percent. One hundred percent. And I don\u2019t think it survives a veto. We have too many smart people who want border security,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cI will veto it, yes.\u201d The resolution was introduced in the Democratic-controlled House Friday, where it is expected to pass. It\u2019s fate is unclear in the Senate, where it would need some Republican votes and a handful of moderate Republicans are wavering. Prosecutors have begun presenting evidence to a grand jury in Washington in their investigation of whether former interior Secretary Ryan Zinke lied to federal investigators, the Washington Post reports. The grand jury deliberations are focused on Zinke\u2019s decision not to grant a petition by two Indian tribes to operate a commercial casino in Connecticut, two sources told the Post. The tribes say Zinke denied their application for political reasons, and investigators with the Interior Department inspector general\u2019s office believe that Zinke lied to them when they questioned him about that claim. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will be the star of a new comic book, CBR reports. It\u2019s called Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Freshman Force and will be released on May 15. Donald Trump blames Amazon\u2019s abandonment of a planned campus in New York on the \u201cradical left.\u201d He also disparaged New York Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s presidential aspirations, per Bloomberg News. Donald Trump said Friday that he bears no responsibility for a Coast Guard lieutenant\u2019s domestic terror plot against a hit list of Democrats and news media figures. \u201cNo I don\u2019t. I think my language is very nice,\u201d Trump told reporters when asked whether his language bears any responsibility for inspiring the plot. \u201cI think it\u2019s a shame. I think it\u2019s a very sad thing when a thing like that happens,\u201d he said. The chairs of six House committees wrote to Attorney General Bill Barr Friday saying that they expect special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report to be made public. \u201cThe public is entitled to know what the Special Counsel has found. We write to you to express, in the strongest possible terms, our expectation that the Department of Justice will release to the public the report Special Counsel Mueller submits to you\u2014without delay and to the maximum extent permitted by law,\u201d they wrote. The letter was signed by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, Committee on Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, Committee on Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters, Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal and Committee on Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel. Donald Trump said that alleged misconduct by his labor secretary Alex Acosta when he was a federal prosecutor happened \u201ca long time ago.\u201d A judge ruled that Acosta, when he was US attorney in Miami, broke the law in a sex trafficking case against billionaire Jeffrey Epstein by failing to inform his alleged underage sex victims of a 2007 plea agreement. \u201cI really don\u2019t know too much about it. I know he\u2019s done a great job as labor secretary,\u201d Trump told reporters in the White House. \u201cThat seems like a long time ago,\u201d he said, adding that Acosta was doing a \u201cfantastic\u201d job. Donald Trump said he looks forward to seeing special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, which we\u2019ve just heard will not be coming next week. \u201cThere was no collusion, there was no obstruction, there was no anything, so that\u2019s the nice part,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House Friday afternoon, adding that he won the 2016 election because, \u201cI was a better candidate than she was, and it had nothing to do with Russia.\u201d \u201cI look forward to seeing the report. If it\u2019s an honest report, it will say that. If it\u2019s not an honest report, it won\u2019t,\u201d he said. Senator Cory Booker will be making a stop in Nevada in his presidential campaign this weekend. Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on the Russia investigation will not be issued next week, a senior Justice Department official tells NBC News and the Washington Post. There had been speculation the report would come out next week. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican considering a primary bid against Donald Trump, asks the Trump campaign, \u201cWhat are you so afraid of?\u201d Hogan told the Washington Post the Republican National Committee has taken \u201cunprecedented\u201d steps to block a possible challenge, referring to an RNC resolution declaring undivided support for Trump. \u201cIf he has unanimous support and everybody is on board, why shut down the normal process?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a hostage situation.\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders is backing a strike by teachers in Oakland. Donald Trump says he\u2019s \u201csurprised\u201d by charges of soliciting prostitution against Patriots owner Robert Kraft, a friend of his. He stressed Kraft has denied the allegations, according to a pool report. Donald Trump said today he would definitely veto a congressional resolution to block his declaration of an emergency at the southern border, according to a pool report. Virginia House Republicans have announced plans to hold a public hearing where the lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, and the two women who have recently accused him of sexual assault can testify, the Associated Press reports: Republican Del. Rob Bell said Friday that the House Courts of Justice Committee will invite Vanessa Tyson, Meredith Watson and Fairfax at an unnamed future hearing date. \u201cThis will give all parties a chance to be heard,\u201d Bell said in brief remarks on the House floor. He added that Republicans believe they have a duty to investigate the allegations made against the lieutenant governor, who is first in line to replace the governor in the event of a vacancy. Democratic House members have said they don\u2019t believe the General Assembly is the best place to investigate the allegations at this time and said they don\u2019t want to impede possible criminal investigations. More stories of mistreatment by staffers of Senator Amy Klobuchar are featured in a new story from the New York Times. In one incident, a staffer forgot to bring a fork with a salad he brought her on a flight. She berated him, then used a comb from her purse to eat the salad, and ordered him to clean it. Klobuchar wrote in one email seen by the Times, \u201cIn 20 years in politics I have never seen worse prep.\u201d Another said, \u201cThis is the worst press staff I ever had.\u201d In another email, she told an aide, \u201cHow can you treat me like this time and time again?\u201d Her office also had an unusually punitive parental leave policy. Aides who took paid leave were required to remain employed for the office for three times as long as they had been on leave. If they did not, the policy called for them to pay back the money they were paid while on leave. Klobuchar\u2019s office told the Times they never actually required any staffer to repay the money. In a new court filing, special counsel Robert Mueller formally denied Roger Stone\u2019s claims that the special counsel tipped off CNN about his coming arrest. A CNN crew was outside Stone\u2019s home to capture his arrest, but have said they were staking out the location and got lucky. Vice-president Mike Pence promised the nation\u2019s governors that Congress will pass an infrastructure bill next year. \u201cI\u2019ll make you a promise. And we\u2019ll ask for your help. That in this Congress we\u2019re going to pass historic infrastructure legislation,\u201d Pence said Friday at a governors\u2019 event at his residence, the Washington Post reports. Democrats have said they support an infrastructure package, but that it must include measures to combat climate change. With a new election called in a disputed House race in North Carolina, Democrat Dan McReady confirmed he is in. \u201cI am running in the special election to represent the people of the ninth district,\u201d he told supporters at a brewery in Waxhaw Friday, according to the Associated Press. The state ordered a new election Thursday after investigating absentee ballot fraud by an operative working for Republican Mark Harris, who had led the race by a small margin. The Trump administration issued a rule Friday banning groups that give referrals for abortions from receiving federal family planning funding. The rule would cut groups like Planned Parenthood off from the $286m family planning program known as Title X, the Washington Post reports. The rules bar providers from making any abortion referrals or performing abortions at the same facilities where they provide Title X services like birth control, mammograms and cancer screenings, according to Politico. It\u2019s expected to be challenged in court. New York Attorney General Letitia James said: \u201cThese new rules are dangerous and unnecessary, and will prevent millions of Americans from obtaining the care they need and deserve. New York will not stand by as this Administration puts New Yorkers\u2019 health at risk for politics, and we will take legal action.\u201d South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem said Friday that Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies have \u201cdevastated\u201d her state, Politico reports. \u201cSouth Dakota has been devastated by the trade wars that are going on,\u201d she said. Trump has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, prompting China to put retaliatory tariffs on US agricultural products like soybeans and wheat. Noem said the woes of the agricultural industry have hit \u201cevery main street business, everybody that has another entity out there that relies on a successful ag industry.\u201d With New York prosecutors preparing charges against Paul Manafort, they\u2019ll face the question of whether the case violates constitutional protections against double jeopardy. There\u2019s a bill pending in the state legislature that would explicitly allow state prosecution of offenses if the target has been pardoned for those offenses on the federal level. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that New York clarify its double jeopardy law to ensure the State can pursue and deliver justice in these cases,\u201d Senator Todd Kaminsky, the sponsor of the bill, said Friday. Senator Lindsey Graham says he expects \u201ca handful\u201d of Republicans in the Senate to vote with Democrats to block Donald Trump\u2019s emergency declaration at the border. The resolution was introduced Friday in the House, and would terminate the emergency Trump is using to get money to build a border wall without Congressional approval. Graham, speaking on Fox News, said he was \u201c100% with the president\u201d on the issue. \u201cTrump sent troops to the border. Obama sent troops to the border. Bush sent troops to the border. What\u2019s the difference of deploying forces to the border to secure is vs. having them build a barrier while they\u2019re there?\u201d the South Carolina Republican said. \u201cI think he has all the power under statute and as commander in chief to send troops to the border to actually erect barriers.\u201d The last in a row of Manhattan apartment buildings bearing Donald Trump\u2019s name will remove the moniker, the Washington Post reports. The last building with the name \u201cTrump Place,\u201d at 220 Riverside Boulevard, said Friday it would remove the president\u2019s name. In a vote among apartment owners, 74.7% voted to remove the name while 25.3% voted to keep it, according to an email obtained by the Post. There had been six Trump Place buildings, and the rest have already voted to get rid of the name. Senator and presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar will meet with former president Jimmy Carter and Democrat Stacey Abrams Friday on a campaign stop in Georgia, the Associated Press reports: Klobuchar spokeswoman Carlie Waibel says the Minnesota Democrat will meet privately with Abrams, who lost a bid for governor last year and delivered the Democratic response to President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address earlier this month. Klobuchar and Carter will speak about her campaign during their meeting, which is also private. Carter\u2019s vice president, Walter Mondale, also represented Minnesota in the Senate and has been one of Klobuchar\u2019s political mentors. Klobuchar also will attend a roundtable discussion on voting rights with local leaders and activists before a fundraiser Friday night in Atlanta. Klobuchar also will campaign this weekend in South Carolina and New Hampshire. A federal appeals court panel appeared skeptical of Donald Trump\u2019s termination of protections for young immigrants at arguments today, CNN reports. Trump ordered an end to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allowed young people brought to the US illegally as children to remain in the country and work legally. The move has been caught up in court ever since. \u201cYour starting premise here is respectively wrong,\u201d Judge Harry Edwards told a Justice Department lawyer, according to CNN. And Judge Thomas Griffith repeatedly said he was \u201cfrustrated\u201d with the government\u2019s argument on the rationale for terminating the Obama-era program. A top executive at Pfizer will host a fundraiser for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s presidential campaign, CNBC reports. The fundraiser will be at the New York home of Sally Susman, executive vice president and chief corporate affairs officer at Pfizer, on March 31. Gillibrand is expected to attend, according to CNBC. Ticket prices range from $1,000 to $2,700. House Democrats have set a vote for Tuesday on a resolution to block the national emergency declaration that Donald Trump issued to access billions of dollars to build a wall along the border with Mexico. \u201cThis is an historic power grab, and it will require historic unity,\u201d Texas congressman Joaquin Castro, a Democrat and chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who is leading the effort, said in a conference call with reporters on Friday. He added: \u201cThe president is declaring a national emergency to fulfill a campaign promise, not because there is an actual emergency on the United States border.\u201d The resolution, which states that Trump\u2019s emergency declaration \u201cis hereby terminated,\u201d has at least 226 co-sponsors, Castro said. Despite an effort to attract bipartisan support, so far only one Republican has signed on, representative Justin Amash, a libertarian from Michigan. \u201cThe president\u2019s act is lawless and does violence to our Constitution, and therefore, to our democracy,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on the call. \u201cNot only is he disrespecting the legislative branch and the Constitution of the United States, he is dishonoring the office in which he serves.\u201d Trump declared a national emergency on the border with Mexico last week after signing legislation that would avert a second government shutdown but provided far less than he demanded to build his wall along the border. With more than half of the members of the House signed on as co-sponsors, the resolution will all but certainly pass the chamber. But the effort is likely to fall short either in the Senate, where only a few Republicans have expressed interest, or to a Trump veto. It is unlikely either chamber could gather enough support to override a presidential veto. Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican who is up for re-election in 2020, was the first lawmaker in her party to publicly state support for a resolution blocking Trump\u2019s emergency declaration. With Republicans in the majority, at least three more Republican senators would have to join her if all of the Democrats voted for the resolution. The Manhattan district attorney is expected to file new charges against Paul Manafort whether or not he is pardoned by Donald Trump, the New York Times reports. As Bloomberg News reported earlier, DA Cy Vance is preparing a case against Manafort in case Trump pardons him on federal charges. The DA\u2019s office first began investigating Mr. Manafort in 2017 in connection with loans he received from two banks, the Times reports. The same loans were subject of some of the counts in the federal indictment that led to his conviction last year. But if Trump were to pardon his former campaign chairman, new charges could be brought on the state level. The New York prosecutor resumed his investigation in recent months, and a state grand jury has been hearing testimony in the case, sources tell the Times. Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, who is up for re-election this year, said Friday he would be \u201cdelighted\u201d to have Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence stump for him, Politico reports. The Republican is the least popular governor up for re-election, according to polls. But he dismissed his low approval ratings. \u201cI have never led in any poll or been popular in any survey that has ever been done,\u201d Bevin said. \u201cAnd here I am.\u201d Donald Trump Jr and now-ex wife Vanessa Trump have finalized their divorce, the Daily Beast reports. \u201cWe finalized our agreement at the end of last year. We are incredibly lucky to have five amazing children and are committed to raising them together. Our kids and their happiness will always be our first priority,\u201d the said in a joint statement. Vanessa Trump filed for divorce last March. Hillary Clinton is criticizing a decision by the EPA to approve a pesticide considered toxic to bees. Senator Amy Klobuchar is pitching her electability in a campaign stop in Iowa, the Des Moines Register reports. \u201cTo do all this, we need to win,\u201d she said after listing Democratic priorities like universal healthcare, expanding voting rights and ending the Citizens Union decision allowing unlimited political spending. Klobuchar also addressed allegations of abusive behavior by former staffers. \u201cAm I a tough boss sometimes? Yes. Have I pushed people too hard? Yes,\u201d she said, according to the Reigster. \u201cBut I have kept expectations for myself that are very high. I\u2019ve asked my staff to meet those same expectations and ... the big point for me is I want the country to meet high expectations, because we don\u2019t have that going now.\u201d The telecom industry will host a fundraiser for Sen. Roger Wicker the night before he presides over a hearing on data privacy, the Hill reports. Wicker is the chair of the Senate Commerce Committee. The fundraiser is set for Feb. 26 at the Capitol Grille in Washington, DC. The hosts are the political action committees for AT&amp;T and the trade group USTelecom, according to an invitation obtained by the Hill. The committee hearing on crafting comprehensive data privacy legislation is set for the next day. New York state prosecutors have assembled a criminal case they could file against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort if Trump pardons Manafort on the federal level, Bloomberg News reports. Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance has charges ready to go including tax offenses. Almost the whole Democratic primary field supports the legalization of marijuana, the Washington Post reports. The latest to get on board is Senator Amy Klobuchar, who tells the Post this morning: \u201cI support the legalization of marijuana and believe that states should have the right to determine the best approach to marijuana within their borders.\u201d Not on board (at least not yet) are potential candidates Joe Biden and Sherrod Brown. The US plans to keep 200 troops in Syria despite Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that troops would be withdrawing from the country, the Associated Press reports: \u201cA small peace keeping group of about 200 will remain in Syria for period of time,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a one-sentence statement. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who had harshly criticized Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. forces out of Syria, applauded the president\u2019s decision to leave a few hundred as part of an \u201cinternational stabilizing force.\u201d Graham said it will ensure that Turkey will not get into a conflict with Syrian Democratic Forces, which helped the United States fight Islamic State militants. Turkey views Kurdish members of the SDF as terrorists... Trump\u2019s decision to pull 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria, which he initially said would be rapid but later slowed down, shocked U.S. allies and angered the Kurds in Syria, who are vulnerable to attack by Turkey. It also prompted the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and drew criticism in Congress. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, called the decision a \u201cbetrayal of our Kurdish partners.\u201d The SDF is currently involved in a standoff over the final sliver of land held by IS in eastern Syria, close to the Iraq border. Many believe the IS threat won\u2019t end with the pocket\u2019s recapture and an insurgency is underway. In a foreboding sign Thursday, the IS claimed responsibility for back-to-back suicide attacks that hit a village miles away, leaving more than a dozen people dead in a rare targeting of civilians. It\u2019s unclear where the 200 remaining U.S. troops will be stationed. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders falsely claimed that Donald Trump has always condemned violence against journalists. In fact, Trump a few months ago praised a Montana congressman for assaulting Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs. House Democrats have introduced their resolution to terminate the national emergency declared by Donald Trump at the US-Mexico border. From the Associated Press: House Democrats on Friday introduced a resolution to block the national emergency declaration that President Donald Trump issued to fund his long-sought wall along the U.S-Mexico border. The move sets up a fight that could result in Trump\u2019s first veto. It starts the clock on a constitutional clash between Trump and Democrats and sets up a vote by the full House as soon as next week. The Democratic-controlled House is sure to pass the measure, and the GOP-run Senate may adopt it as well despite Trump\u2019s opposition. Any Trump veto would likely be sustained, but the upcoming battle will test Republican support for Trump\u2019s move, which even some of his allies view as a stretch -- and a slap at lawmakers\u2019 control over the power of the federal purse. A staff aide introduced the measure during a short pro forma session of the House in which Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., presided over an almost empty chamber. Amid reports that special counsel Robert Mueller will soon be producing his report on the Russia investigation, Donald Trump again calls for what he describes as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d to end. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the administration is \u201clooking into\u201d a ruling that Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, when he was a prosecutor, violated the rights of sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s victims. \u201cMy understanding is that it\u2019s a very complicated case ... but that they made the best possible decision and deal they could have gotten at that time,\u201d she said, Bloomberg News reports. Representative David Cicilline will introduce legislation to require that special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on the Russia investigation be made public. The House Judiciary Committee could also move to compel Mueller to come before the committee and produce the report, he said Friday on CNN\u2019s New Day. \u201cWe\u2019re going to use both legal remedies, legislative remedies, court remedies if we need to. This report belongs to the American people. They have a right to know the truth,\u201d said Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat and Judiciary Committee member. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely critical that the American people who have been watching this investigation for the last two years are entitled to know the conclusions of the investigation, and they should see the report in its entirety, absent of course any stuff that has to be kept classified,\u201d he said. Senator Kamala Harris has hired a seasoned California political strategist to run her presidential campaign in her home state, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Courtni Pugh will be the Democrat\u2019s California director. Donald Trump will leave it up to the attorney general, Bill Barr, to decide whether to publicly release special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on the Russia investigation, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said this morning. \u201cIf he did it the other way, you guys would go crazy,\u201d she said outside the White House, according to CBS News. \u201cHe\u2019s following the process and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is putting her money where her mouth is when it comes to living wage policies, paying her congressional staffers a minimum of $52,000 a year, Roll Call reported. For the lowest-ranking position in congressional offices, staff assistant, median pay is closer to $35,000 a year. To make the budget work, the New York Democrat will cap salaries in her office at $80,000, whereas many chiefs of staff on Capitol Hill make six figures. \u201cWe think that if a person is working, they should make enough to live,\u201d said Corbin Trent, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s communications director. Democrats in the House plan to introduce a resolution Friday to stop Donald Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency at the southern border. House speaker Nancy Pelosi circulated a letter Wednesday asking lawmakers to sign on to the resolution to terminate the emergency declaration, according to the Hill. \u201cThe president\u2019s decision to go outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process violates the Constitution and must be terminated,\u201d she wrote. As of Thursday afternoon, 216 lawmakers had signed on, including one Republican, Roll Call reported. Pelosi and Representative Joaquin Castro, who is sponsoring the resolution, are set to discuss it on a press call at 10am.",

Earlier this month a video emerged of Indonesian police interrogating a young boy, in handcuffs and on the floor, while officers wrapped a large snake around him. The boy, who had been arrested for stealing a mobile phone during a crackdown on petty crime in Jayawijaya district, became increasingly distressed, screaming in fear as officers laughed. A human rights lawyer, Veronica Koman \u2013 who circulated the video \u2013 said the interrogation methods were torture and violated police policies and several laws. The widely circulated video prompted a rare apology from Indonesian authorities, who said the officers involved had been moved and given ethics training. However, in a statement on Friday, the UN panel called for prompt and impartial investigations. \u201cThis case reflects a widespread pattern of violence, alleged arbitrary arrests and detention as well as methods amounting to torture used by the Indonesian police and military in Papua,\u201d it said. \u201cThese tactics are often used against indigenous Papuans and human rights defenders. This latest incident is symptomatic of the deeply entrenched discrimination and racism that indigenous Papuans face, including by Indonesian military and police.\u201d The UN panel comprised special rapporteurs and working groups on the rights of indigenous peoples, on arbitrary detention, human rights defenders, torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and on contemporary forms of racism and discrimination. Special rapporteurs and working groups are volunteer experts working within the Human Rights Council\u2019s independent fact-finding and monitoring mechanism. Benny Wenda, the exiled leader of the West Papuan independence movement, welcomed the statement and claimed it as vindication of the long-running civil conflict which has seen claims of an estimated 500,000 killed. \u201cThe West Papuan people are crying out for their freedom and self-determination,\u201d he said. \u201cFinally, the Indonesian state\u2019s brutal repression and genocidal killing is being recognised by the United Nations.\u201d Although the UN statement was prompted by the incident with the snake, it comes several months into a violent escalation of the West Papua conflict.
