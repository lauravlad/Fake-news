      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is preparing to send half a dozen staunch Conservative loyalists to the House of Lords, in an attempt to bolster the party\u2019s position in the upper chamber. The new crop of peers are unlikely to be confirmed until after the 31 October Brexit deadline \u2013 but the appointments will be read as a signal Johnson is determined to stamp his mark on parliament. Theresa May\u2019s resignation honours list is expected to be announced in the coming days, with rewards for several of the key lieutenants who supported her through her premiership, including her chief of staff, the former MP Gavin Barwell. Johnson is believed to have already drawn up a list of up to six names to be submitted to the House of Lords appointments commission, which has to approve new members. The Conservatives have 238 peers in the House of Lords \u2013 but the government can easily be defeated if the 178 Labour and 95 Liberal Democrats work together. The previous government faced a string of heavy losses over Brexit, which paved the way for MPs to exact concessions, including on a meaningful vote. In several cases, Tory peers including the former Hong Kong governor, Chris Patten (Lord Patten of Barnes), sided with the opposition parties. Recently, peers passed a motion tabled by Labour\u2019s leader in the House of Lords, Angela Smith, calling on the government to establish a cross-party select committee to examine the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. The former prime minister, Gordon Brown, has suggested that MPs should take up the idea when they return to Westminster next week, and set aside a day of parliamentary time to debate the consequences of leaving without a deal. Johnson has been accused of plotting to override parliament since he arrived at No 10, with his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, telling colleagues they must be ready to use any means necessary to ensure Brexit happens by the end of October. Both the cabinet and Johnson\u2019s Downing Street team have been packed with veterans of the successful Vote Leave campaign, stoking speculation that he expects to be fighting a general election in the coming months. Johnson\u2019s ministers had to agree they were willing to countenance a no-deal Brexit if necessary, after May faced a string of rebellions, including from within her own cabinet. In a foreword to a new edition of the ministerial code published last week, Johnson insisted there must be \u201cno misuse of process or procedure by any individual minister that would seek to stall the collective decisions necessary to deliver Brexit and secure the wider changes needed across our United Kingdom\u201d. During Johnson\u2019s leadership campaign, there was speculation that he could send George Osborne to the Lords, after the former remainer gave the support of the newspaper he edits, the Evening Standard, to the prime minister\u2019s leadership campaign. Johnson has backed Osborne\u2019s campaign to be the next managing director of the International Monetary Fund \u2013 though it is highly unlikely to succeed, as the EU has already chosen its own candidate.",

To sell this to the people, Boris Johnson would need to present it as a victory. The compromise would be for the EU to postpone the backstop to the end of the two-year transition period \u2013 Johnson could sell this as them removing the backstop from the withdrawal agreement (even though it would not have come into effect till then anyway).

      "body": "<p>Has there been a rise in rightwing comedy? Or just more acts pinning their colours to that mast? A common claim \u2013 flogged to death by the conservative commentariat \u2013 is that comedy is dominated by a \u201cliberal elite\u201d. That was always a tenuous premise: beyond the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/feb/01/jeremy-hardy-obituary\">Jeremy Hardy</a>, the Marks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/mark-steel\">Steel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/markthomas\">Thomas</a>, and mid-career <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/09/josie-long-review-tender-new-baby-mother-stand-edinburgh\">Josie Long</a>, where are all these socialist clowns we keep hearing about? But it\u2019s looking even more ragged now. Since journeyman standup <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/may/15/tory-comedian-geoff-norcott-brexit-conservative\">Geoff Norcott</a> had the bright idea of relaunching himself as a Tory and became a fixture on Question Time, other acts have followed suit. Anti-woke is the fringe pose <em>du jour</em>, not infrequently struck by comics out and proud about their rightwing affiliations.</p> <p>They draw their charge \u2013 such as it is \u2013 from the conceit that they\u2019re fearlessly flouting tyrannical orthodoxy. But the idea that it\u2019s Transgressive \u2013 the title of Scottish comic Leo Kearse\u2019s show \u2013 to PC-bash in public is a bit of a stretch. Ricky Gervais, Dave Chappelle, Jimmy Carr: comedy arenas are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/apr/03/dave-chappelle-ricky-gervais-standup-comedy-transgender\">full of this stuff</a>. You can\u2019t open the papers or turn on TV without hearing anti-woke and pro-Brexit sentiment. If \u2013 as these comics insist \u2013 free speech is under attack, it\u2019s a pretty feeble attack. Although it did succeed in having Kearse\u2019s previous show, Right-Wing Comedian, cancelled in Australia last year after <a href=\"https://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2018/11/19/41730/i_dont_understand_how_it_could_be_interpreted_as_transphobic\">protests about its alleged transphobia</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03211930c04ee0b9fc792ba630341ad0af71e5f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03211930c04ee0b9fc792ba630341ad0af71e5f9/0_103_2362_1417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Konstantin Kisin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Right-on \u2026 Konstantin Kisin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Ullathorne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps that\u2019s why \u201cwe\u2019re afraid of saying the wrong thing these days\u201d, as Konstantin Kisin puts it. Kisin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/dec/11/comedians-asked-to-sign-behavioural-agreement-for-soas-gig\">made the headlines last year</a> by refusing to perform at a London university after being asked to sign a \u201cbehavioural agreement\u201d relating to the content of his act. (He doesn\u2019t mention that the organiser swiftly apologised.) He raises some legitimate questions in a show exploring why 3,300 people were arrested in the UK last year for things they said on social media.</p> <p>He also contradicts himself. We mustn\u2019t call people we disagree with Nazis, he says \u2013 then ends with a George Carlin quote equating political correctness with fascism. The politics of Dominic Frisby\u2019s show Libertarian Love Songs (Frisby is standing as a p<a href=\"https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/news/5440/dominic_frisby_mp/\">rexit Party candidate for parliament</a>) are likewise all over the place. Ukulele in hand, he sings that \u201call taxation is theft\u201d, then criticises Amazon for not paying its taxes. He criticises the ubiquitous blandness of modern Britain, then croons a hymn to Wetherspoons.</p> <p>But the show has its charms. Frisby emerges more as contrarian English eccentric than reactionary. His rant about \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d, and the sweet ending to his song about hate speech, both suggest common ground between Frisby\u2019s anti-corporate shtick and the politics of the bolshiest social justice warrior of rightwing demonology.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3771a3091160229b5d7b261db0a8cb889e5c5f6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3771a3091160229b5d7b261db0a8cb889e5c5f6f/386_842_2123_2652/801.jpg\" alt=\"Alice Marshall as Titania McGrath\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alice Marshall as Titania McGrath.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Windmill</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Time was, of course, progressive fringe audiences might have rejected even a whiff of Toryism in their comedy. Only five years ago, <a href=\"mailto:https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/03/jim-davidson-standup-edinburgh-festival-2014-review\">Jim Davidson felt like an outlier here</a> \u2013 although he played in a major venue and was widely reviewed. But we\u2019re all more mindful of diversity and inclusion these days \u2013 and rightist comics are cashing in on the affirmative action. Kisin, Kearse and Frisby\u2019s shows were well attended on my visits, and fair enough: they can be entertaining, and put forward the occasional intelligent point of view. Not so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/05/titania-mcgrath-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh-festival-2019\">Titania McGrath</a>, the fictional Twitter avatar of comedian Andrew Doyle \u2013 now incarnated at the fringe by comic Alice Marshall. Fitfully amusing online, McGrath is a crude caricature on stage, a mean-spirited and largely witless burlesque of millennial wokeness.</p> <p>The show\u2019s presiding idea is that the left is building a gulag out of PC terminology and ever-changing gender pronouns. Spoiler alert: that isn\u2019t true. But there are pertinent conversations to have \u2013 and jokes to make \u2013 about where we draw the lines around offensive and illegal, between acceptable jokes and hateful acts. Kisin wonders how the defence of free speech became \u201ca far-right dog whistle\u201d, and it\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s traditionally a progressive cause, and some of the best comedy in Edinburgh on wokeness and new sensitivities around language are from leftwing comics \u2013 like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/06/ahir-shah-dots-review-monkey-barrel-comedy-edinburgh-festival-2019\">Ahir Shah</a>, say, with his routine on the phrase \u201cpeople of colour\u201d (\u201cas if I\u2019m indistinguishable from a black woman\u201d).</p> <p>If there\u2019s debate around whether woke-bashing is an exclusively rightwing pursuit, there\u2019s none around the Tory credentials of Sarah Southern\u2019s show on the Free Fringe.

      "bodyText": "Has there been a rise in rightwing comedy? Or just more acts pinning their colours to that mast? A common claim \u2013 flogged to death by the conservative commentariat \u2013 is that comedy is dominated by a \u201cliberal elite\u201d. That was always a tenuous premise: beyond the late Jeremy Hardy, the Marks Steel and Thomas, and mid-career Josie Long, where are all these socialist clowns we keep hearing about? But it\u2019s looking even more ragged now. Since journeyman standup Geoff Norcott had the bright idea of relaunching himself as a Tory and became a fixture on Question Time, other acts have followed suit. Anti-woke is the fringe pose du jour, not infrequently struck by comics out and proud about their rightwing affiliations. They draw their charge \u2013 such as it is \u2013 from the conceit that they\u2019re fearlessly flouting tyrannical orthodoxy. But the idea that it\u2019s Transgressive \u2013 the title of Scottish comic Leo Kearse\u2019s show \u2013 to PC-bash in public is a bit of a stretch. Ricky Gervais, Dave Chappelle, Jimmy Carr: comedy arenas are full of this stuff. You can\u2019t open the papers or turn on TV without hearing anti-woke and pro-Brexit sentiment. If \u2013 as these comics insist \u2013 free speech is under attack, it\u2019s a pretty feeble attack. Although it did succeed in having Kearse\u2019s previous show, Right-Wing Comedian, cancelled in Australia last year after protests about its alleged transphobia. Perhaps that\u2019s why \u201cwe\u2019re afraid of saying the wrong thing these days\u201d, as Konstantin Kisin puts it. Kisin made the headlines last year by refusing to perform at a London university after being asked to sign a \u201cbehavioural agreement\u201d relating to the content of his act. (He doesn\u2019t mention that the organiser swiftly apologised.) He raises some legitimate questions in a show exploring why 3,300 people were arrested in the UK last year for things they said on social media. He also contradicts himself. We mustn\u2019t call people we disagree with Nazis, he says \u2013 then ends with a George Carlin quote equating political correctness with fascism. The politics of Dominic Frisby\u2019s show Libertarian Love Songs (Frisby is standing as a prexit Party candidate for parliament) are likewise all over the place. Ukulele in hand, he sings that \u201call taxation is theft\u201d, then criticises Amazon for not paying its taxes. He criticises the ubiquitous blandness of modern Britain, then croons a hymn to Wetherspoons. But the show has its charms. Frisby emerges more as contrarian English eccentric than reactionary. His rant about \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d, and the sweet ending to his song about hate speech, both suggest common ground between Frisby\u2019s anti-corporate shtick and the politics of the bolshiest social justice warrior of rightwing demonology. Time was, of course, progressive fringe audiences might have rejected even a whiff of Toryism in their comedy. Only five years ago, Jim Davidson felt like an outlier here \u2013 although he played in a major venue and was widely reviewed. But we\u2019re all more mindful of diversity and inclusion these days \u2013 and rightist comics are cashing in on the affirmative action. Kisin, Kearse and Frisby\u2019s shows were well attended on my visits, and fair enough: they can be entertaining, and put forward the occasional intelligent point of view. Not so Titania McGrath, the fictional Twitter avatar of comedian Andrew Doyle \u2013 now incarnated at the fringe by comic Alice Marshall. Fitfully amusing online, McGrath is a crude caricature on stage, a mean-spirited and largely witless burlesque of millennial wokeness. The show\u2019s presiding idea is that the left is building a gulag out of PC terminology and ever-changing gender pronouns. Spoiler alert: that isn\u2019t true. But there are pertinent conversations to have \u2013 and jokes to make \u2013 about where we draw the lines around offensive and illegal, between acceptable jokes and hateful acts. Kisin wonders how the defence of free speech became \u201ca far-right dog whistle\u201d, and it\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s traditionally a progressive cause, and some of the best comedy in Edinburgh on wokeness and new sensitivities around language are from leftwing comics \u2013 like Ahir Shah, say, with his routine on the phrase \u201cpeople of colour\u201d (\u201cas if I\u2019m indistinguishable from a black woman\u201d). If there\u2019s debate around whether woke-bashing is an exclusively rightwing pursuit, there\u2019s none around the Tory credentials of Sarah Southern\u2019s show on the Free Fringe. Southern was the Conservative aide who resigned in 2012 after the so-called \u201ccash for access\u201d scandal. Now she\u2019s doing standup about her love of Mrs Thatcher, her time in David Cameron\u2019s employ and her fall from grace. The promised interrogation of where she now stands politically never quite materialises, beyond a lame disavowal of the actual record of the government she helped precipitate. (\u201cSome of their policies don\u2019t sit well with me\u201d) But if hers is a low-wattage show, it\u2019s not objectionable. Nor does it \u2013 or any of the shows mentioned \u2013 herald a new rightward direction for standup. There may be those who consider rightwing comedy oxymoronic because comedy mustn\u2019t punch down, and punching down is what rightwingery is all about.
