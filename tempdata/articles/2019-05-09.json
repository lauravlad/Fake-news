And Gauke is not even standing for the leadership. As he joked in his speech, \u201cwhen it comes to any future leadership election, my position is to resist the clamour to stand. I remain confident that my resistance will be greater than the clamour.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The full text of the speech is<a href=\"https://www.ukonward.com/the-rise-of-populism-what-caused-it-and-how-the-centre-right-should-respond/\"> here. </a> And here are some of the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Gauke said, although there was a case for the Conservative party embracing populism, it should reject i</strong>t. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The rise of populism, the fragmenting of traditional party loyalties and the impact of Brexit means that there is a case for the Conservative party to become a more populist, anti-establishment, culturally conservative party. But I argue that such a choice would limit our electoral appeal and leave the UK badly placed to take advantage of the opportunities of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. In other words, this is a speech that argues for a Conservative party to continue to be a broad church and an advocate for mainstream values.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>As <strong>Tom Clark </strong>argues in <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/other/polling-populist-prime-minister-british-trump-boris-johnson\">a good Prospect article,</a> there is polling evidence suggesting a lurch to populism might be helpful to anyone trying to win the Tory leadership contest. But Gauke says not only that populist policies wrong, but that embracing them would cost the Conservatives the metropolitan voters they need to win a majority.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Gauke said, to combat populism, the Tories should avoid trying to pretend their are simply solutions to the nation\u2019s problems.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We need to be open and straight-forward that many decisions are complex, that life involves trade-offs and that an easy, simple answer is often the wrong one. In response to the glib, easy answer, we shouldn\u2019t be frightened to say that, \u201cwell, it\u2019s a little bit more complicated than that\u201d. </p> \n   <p>Those of us who are politicians should treat the public as adults and be prepared to set out that we may often face a range of imperfect choices, that most choices have costs as well as benefits. Over-simplifying issues \u2013 a tendency of the populist politician \u2013 only increases scepticism in our politics when claims turn out to be untrue. If we want to rebuild trust in our politics, we should strive harder to communicate the factors that influence any decision or policy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said, on Brexit, the Tories needed to reject populist-style wishful thinking. </strong>He did not mention any of his colleagues, but this passage seemed to be aimed at Brexiters like Boris Johnson. Gauke said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We need to set out more clearly and openly the trade-offs and choices that lie ahead of us as we establish a new relationship with the 27 member states of the European Union. Reluctance by some participants in this debate to accept that some choices have costs has meant that the debate on our future relationship has been, too often, characterised by wishful thinking.</p> \n   <p>This wishful thinking \u2013 that, for example, we could have the exact same benefits as membership of the EU but with none of the obligations \u2013 has not survived the collision with reality. But it has left some voters bemused and angry that the simple Brexit they were promised by some has not been delivered. But over-promising, over-simplifying and failing to deliver will only encourage further disenchantment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Gauke said Margaret Thatcher showed how the Tories could combine electoral success with rejecting populism.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The biggest problem with populist policies is that too often, they\u2019re just plain wrong.</p> \n   <p>Let me begin with the economics. The vast majority of Conservatives look back with pride at how Mrs Thatcher\u2019s governments turned round the British economy from being the sick man of Europe to being a dynamic, enterprising powerhouse.</p> \n   <p> She did so not by embracing populism but by confronting it. Whereas populism tends to seek to preserve existing jobs and industries, insulating an economy from foreign competition, the 1980s were a period when the government did not seek to prevent necessary structural changes. She took steps to make our economy more open through both unilateral and multilateral measures, foreign investment was encouraged, structural change embraced.</p> \n   <p>And whereas as populism tends to be fiscally irresponsible \u2013 it is the politics of saying \u2018yes\u2019 and rarely of saying \u2018no\u2019 - the Thatcher governments\u2019 fiscal approach was thoroughly conservative, ensuring that we sought to live within our means, tightly controlling public spending and even allowing the tax burden to rise when necessary to get the public finances under control.</p> \n   <p>A responsible government cannot agree to every spending proposal put in front of it. Nor can it afford to pursue every proposal for unfunded tax cuts. I am the first to argue the case for a competitive, pro-business tax system \u2013 I am very proud to be associated with our corporation tax reforms \u2013 but the idea that cutting taxes inevitably pays for itself is simply the right-wing equivalent of the magic money tree.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He rejected claims that inequality was fuelling populism. </strong>In a long passage trying to explain why populism was increasing, he cited economic insecurity, social media, stagnating living standards and structural changes as among the causes. But he said he did not accept the common argument that rising inequality was part of the problem. He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are many who argue that rising inequality is a driver for populism. I am a little cautious about this, at least in the context of the UK, simply for the reason that inequality (contrary to what nearly everyone thinks they know) is not, in fact, rising. As the IFS has pointed out, income inequality has remained pretty consistent since the 1990s and, since the great recession of the late 2000s, earnings growth has generally been greatest for lower earners.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5676be877361bc487e62ed257cd24237d8b9b6a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5676be877361bc487e62ed257cd24237d8b9b6a/0_108_2644_1587/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Gauke\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Gauke</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5cd40e218f086f179813e241\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-09T11:54:43.859Z\">12.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Corbyn's speech and Q&amp;A - Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here are the main points from <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong>\u2019s <a href=\"https://t.co/o2btiJ8mxo\">speech</a> and Q&amp;A at the Labour European elections campaign launch.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn said he thought a second referendum on Brexit could be \u201ca healing process\u201d.</strong> (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/may/09/brexit-latest-news-corbyn-manifesto-launch-corbyn-seeks-to-make-euro-elections-about-social-justice-not-brexit-as-he-launches-labour-campaign-live-news?page=with:block-5cd407318f084f582f896213#block-5cd407318f084f582f896213\"> 12.18pm.)</a> He made the comment in his Q&amp;A after a speech in which he suggested that Labour would not back a people\u2019s vote on a Brexit deal it supported.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>I think too often there is lazy thinking, to be frank, on Brexit and a failure to look at that longer-term relationship between the United Kingdom and Europe.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The 2016 vote was motivated by \u201cconfidence, optimism, a desire to be more global,\u201d Barclay said. \u201cIt certainly was not the Nigel Farage little-Englander portrayal.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Speaking on a panel entitled \u2018new ambitions for the future of Europe\u2019, Barclay added:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Brexit from my perspective is about shared values, wanting to have a political relationship, identifying shared challenges, but also being able to look forward, rather than to constantly hark back to a vote three years ago.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Brexit secretary, who also said Brexit was \u201can opportunity to be seized\u2019, was greeted with polite applause from the audience of politicians and EU experts, although also faced scepticism. </p> \n  <p>\u201cBrexit, it\u2019s a lose lose agenda for the UK and for Europe,\u201d said fellow panellist<strong> Luca Jahier,</strong> president of the European Economic and Social Committee, a body for EU social partners.</p> \n  <p>Another commentator in the room said listening to Barclay\u2019s speech made him think \u201cin a semi serious way\u201d that the UK was reconsidering its decision to leave. The person also added that \u201ca more flexible approach [from the EU] might have given the UK one more chance to stay in\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Asked whether the UK faced challenges it could manage better outside the EU, Barclay said \u201cin politics you should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time\u201d as he called for a wide-ranging future relationship that went beyond trade, to cover shared interests on migration and security.</p> \n  <p>He said the EU would be accepting \u201ca rather limiting relationship\u201d if it imposed too many constraints on the UK \u201cwhich has much to offer in terms of security\u201d.</p> \n  <p>During the speech that discussed climate change, migration and Nato, he repeated the government\u2019s pledge that the UK\u2019s commitment to Europe\u2019s security was \u201cfundamental and unconditional\u201d.</p> \n  <p>EU leaders meeting in the town hall of the picturesque Transylvanian city are expected to sign a declaration later on Thursday pledging to stick together through \u201cthick and thin\u201d. European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker originally proposed holding the summit on 30 March, the day after what should have been Brexit day.

And, according to the extracts from his speech sent out in advance, he is keen to shift the conversation away from Brexit. Here are the key points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn will seek to make the Euro elections about social justice, not Brexit.</strong> This is what the party says in its news release about the Labour manifesto.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The manifesto \u2013<em> \u2018Transforming Britain and Europe: for the many not the few\u2019 </em>\u2013 sets out Labour\u2019s plans to work across borders to take on the tax dodgers, the polluters and the migrant baiters of the far right. </p> \n   <p>From taking urgent action on the climate emergency, to protecting and strengthening workers\u2019 rights, to facing down the far right, the manifesto speaks to the lives of people in Britain and across Europe.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn will restate Labour\u2019s qualified support for a second referendum, implying he would not back a people\u2019s vote on a Brexit deal Labour supported.</strong> Corbyn will say:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Labour\u2019s alternative plan for Brexit, which protects jobs, living standards and communities, would end the chaos caused by the Conservatives and let us focus on the other big issues facing our country.</p> \n   <p>But we can never accept the government\u2019s bad deal or a disastrous no deal. So if we can\u2019t get a sensible deal, along the lines of our alternative plan, or a general election, Labour backs the option of a public vote.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He will claim that Labour is the only party that can appeal to both remain supporters and leave supporters.</strong> He will say:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To transform our country, and tackle injustice, inequality and the climate crisis, we need to unite the overwhelming majority of people and take on the privileged and powerful. </p> \n   <p>That\u2019s why we insist the real divide in our country is not how people voted in the EU referendum. The real divide is between the many and the few. Whether you\u2019re from Tottenham or Mansfield, Stockwell or Stoke, here in Medway or in Manchester, so many of the problems you face are the same.</p> \n   <p>Other parties appeal to just one side of the Brexit debate because they aren\u2019t really committed to taking on the tax dodgers, the big polluters, or the financial gamblers who crashed our economy a decade ago. Labour is the only party with a plan to unite our country to make it work for the many not the few.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The danger with this argument, of course, is that there is now quite a lot of evidence suggesting that the real divide in Britain is not how people feel about the many and the few, but about whether they back leave or remain.</p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>9.45am:</em> The Peoples\u2019 Vote campaign publishes <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/foreign-affairs/brexit/news/103751/new-analysis-finds-brits-would-be-%C2%A3800-year-worse-under\">a report saying leaving the EU but staying in a customs union would reduce national income by \u00a380bn a year compared to staying in.</a></p> \n  <p><em>10.45am: </em>Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, gives a speech on the future of Conservatism.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has again rebuffed the demands of many of his own activists for Labour to become the party of remain at the European elections later this month, insisting he will stand on the \u201ccommon ground\u201d. Nicola Sturgeon has urged Scottish voters to treat both Labour and the Conservatives as pro-Brexit parties in the European elections, claiming only the Scottish National party has the weight to fight to remain in the EU. (See 3.52pm.) David Gauke, the justice secretary, has accepted that voters will \u201ckick\u201d the Tories in the European elections, but warned the party against populism and \u201cyearning for a mythical\u201d past. Pro-remain parties are in talks about forming an alliance to support a single candidate in a byelection in Peterborough. The Brexit party has announced the former Tory-supporting businessman Mike Greene as its candidate for the Peterborough byelection. Theresa May has confirmed the government will allocate \u00a3200m to fix private tower blocks wrapped in combustible Grenfell-style cladding, after mounting public anger against dozens of freeholders and developers who have refused to pay to make them safe. Air passengers should pay a 50p levy to ensure they can be flown home should their airline go bust, a government review has proposed. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Nicola Sturgeon has urged Scottish voters to treat both Labour and the Conservatives as pro-Brexit parties in the European elections, claiming only the Scottish National party has the weight to fight to remain in the EU. Describing the vote on 23 May as the most important European election in Scotland\u2019s history, the SNP leader and Scottish first minister also reiterated her call for a fresh referendum on Scottish independence before 2021, regardless of whether Brexit happens. She said this was a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d for Scottish voters to reassert themselves at a UK and European level. She said: It is striking, I would say depressingly, just how close together Labour and the Tories are on Brexit. On this defining issue of our time, Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May have so much more in common than they like to pretend. They oth want to take Scotland and the UK out of the European Union. There is no escaping the fact that Labour is a pro-Brexit party, just as the Tories are a pro-Brexit party. She said Labour was trying to face both ways at once, wanting to end freedom of movement but claim it wanted the closest possible partnership with the EU. The latest opinion polls suggest the SNP will attract hundreds of thousands of pro-EU voters, chiefly at Labour\u2019s expense. The SNP was at 40% in a recent YouGov poll and set to win at least three or possibly four of Scotland\u2019s six European parliament seats. With Change UK competing for pro-EU seats, and the Brexit party and Ukip chipping away at Tory support, Labour is down to 14% while the Tories are stranded at 10% and will struggle to hold their sole Scottish European seat. Sturgeon will again face questions in this campaign about the apparently contradictory logic of wishing to take Scotland out of its centuries-old union with the UK but remain in a much larger European union. Citing Croatia and Denmark have leading roles in the EU, she described the EU as \u201ca collective of independent states\u201d, and said an independent Scotland would have a seat \u201cat the top table.\u201d Within the UK, she added, Scotland\u2019s voice on the EU was repeatedly ignored by the Conservative government in London. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, is in Edinburgh launching the SNP\u2019s campaign for the European elections. She has just finished a speech in which she urged Scottish voters to use the vote, two weeks today, to send a message to Theresa May that \u201cScotland has had enough of being ignored\u201d. This is by far the most important European election in Scotland\u2019s history. At stake in this election is not just which parties and which candidates will be elected to the European parliament. At stake also is whether Scotland can remain inside the European Union at all. On 23 May by voting SNP, people in Scotland can send a clear and unequivocal message to Theresa May. That message is this: Scotland has had enough of being ignored. It is worth pointing out, obviously, that the results of the European elections will have no direct bearing at all on whether or not Scotland stays in the European Union. That will be determined by decisions taken by the UK government and by the UK parliament (and conceivably, further down the line, by the Scottish people in a referendum.) But the European elections will allow voters to convey a message to London about their feelings about Brexit. This is from UTV\u2019s Ken Reid. The People\u2019s Vote campaign has published some interesting Brexit polling today, to coincide with the research it released overnight saying leaving the EU but staying in a customs union would reduce national income by \u00a380bn a year compared to staying in. Here are the key results of the poll, which was conducted by Opinium and which involved a sample of 2,000 respondents. It focused on a possible Brexit deal involving the UK staying in a customs union with the EU, which is the idea at the heart of the cross-party talks. Almost three quarters of voters (74%) think a Brexit deal involving the UK staying in a customs union with the EU would not honour the referendum result, the poll suggests. Most voters would not be happy about a customs deal outcome, the poll suggests. By a margin of almost two to one (60% to 33%), people say they would feel \u201cdisappointed, angry or anxious rather than happy, relieved or delighted\u201d by such a deal. Both main parties could lose support if they backed a customs union compromise, the poll suggests. Only 12% of people said they would be more likely to vote Labour in these circumstances, against 27% of people who said they would be less likely to vote Labour. And only 12% of people said they would be more likely to vote Conservatives in these circumstances, against 30% who said it would make them less likely to vote Tory. A plurality of voters support a confirmatory referendum, the poll suggests. Some 49% of people are in favour, and 30% are against. Labour supporters strongly back the idea (by 67% to 10%). But even Conservative supporters are very narrowly in favour (by 43% to 41%), the poll suggests. Commenting on these findings in a statement released by the People\u2019s Vote campaign, Sam Gyimah, the Conservative former universities minister, said: Even if the government and the Labour party can agree a customs union deal, it will do nothing to break the spell that Nigel Farage has currently cast on British politics. These poll findings show such an outcome would be hugely unpopular with voters because it would satisfy neither leavers nor remainers. Instead, more and more MPs and members of the public are concluding that the only way to secure a stable majority and a lasting settlement is to put this vexed issue back to the people. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, spoke to the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming at the Sibiu summit. He sounded a bit fed up with Brexit. My colleague Jennifer Rankin has been tweeting from the EU summit in Sibiu - the one Theresa May is not attending because it is about the EU\u2019s post-Brexit future. Dame Pauline Green, who was leader of the Labour MEPs, and then leader of the Party of European Socialists group in the European parliament in the 1990s, has announced that she is leaving the party. In an open letter to Jeremy Corbyn, she says she is quitting because the party is not unequivocally backing a second referendum. She will vote for Change UK instead at the European elections, she says. The Change UK MP Chris Leslie has tweeted her letter. As I said earlier, David Gauke, the justice secretary, gave a speech on populism this morning that was more thoughtful and interesting than most of the \u201cwide-ranging speeches\u201d we are getting from leading Tories at the moment. And Gauke is not even standing for the leadership. As he joked in his speech, \u201cwhen it comes to any future leadership election, my position is to resist the clamour to stand. I remain confident that my resistance will be greater than the clamour.\u201d The full text of the speech is here. And here are some of the main points. Gauke said, although there was a case for the Conservative party embracing populism, it should reject it. He said: The rise of populism, the fragmenting of traditional party loyalties and the impact of Brexit means that there is a case for the Conservative party to become a more populist, anti-establishment, culturally conservative party. But I argue that such a choice would limit our electoral appeal and leave the UK badly placed to take advantage of the opportunities of the 21st century. In other words, this is a speech that argues for a Conservative party to continue to be a broad church and an advocate for mainstream values. As Tom Clark argues in a good Prospect article, there is polling evidence suggesting a lurch to populism might be helpful to anyone trying to win the Tory leadership contest. But Gauke says not only that populist policies wrong, but that embracing them would cost the Conservatives the metropolitan voters they need to win a majority. Gauke said, to combat populism, the Tories should avoid trying to pretend their are simply solutions to the nation\u2019s problems. He said: We need to be open and straight-forward that many decisions are complex, that life involves trade-offs and that an easy, simple answer is often the wrong one. In response to the glib, easy answer, we shouldn\u2019t be frightened to say that, \u201cwell, it\u2019s a little bit more complicated than that\u201d. Those of us who are politicians should treat the public as adults and be prepared to set out that we may often face a range of imperfect choices, that most choices have costs as well as benefits. Over-simplifying issues \u2013 a tendency of the populist politician \u2013 only increases scepticism in our politics when claims turn out to be untrue. If we want to rebuild trust in our politics, we should strive harder to communicate the factors that influence any decision or policy. He said, on Brexit, the Tories needed to reject populist-style wishful thinking. He did not mention any of his colleagues, but this passage seemed to be aimed at Brexiters like Boris Johnson. Gauke said: We need to set out more clearly and openly the trade-offs and choices that lie ahead of us as we establish a new relationship with the 27 member states of the European Union. Reluctance by some participants in this debate to accept that some choices have costs has meant that the debate on our future relationship has been, too often, characterised by wishful thinking. This wishful thinking \u2013 that, for example, we could have the exact same benefits as membership of the EU but with none of the obligations \u2013 has not survived the collision with reality. But it has left some voters bemused and angry that the simple Brexit they were promised by some has not been delivered. But over-promising, over-simplifying and failing to deliver will only encourage further disenchantment. Gauke said Margaret Thatcher showed how the Tories could combine electoral success with rejecting populism. He said: The biggest problem with populist policies is that too often, they\u2019re just plain wrong. Let me begin with the economics. The vast majority of Conservatives look back with pride at how Mrs Thatcher\u2019s governments turned round the British economy from being the sick man of Europe to being a dynamic, enterprising powerhouse. She did so not by embracing populism but by confronting it. Whereas populism tends to seek to preserve existing jobs and industries, insulating an economy from foreign competition, the 1980s were a period when the government did not seek to prevent necessary structural changes. She took steps to make our economy more open through both unilateral and multilateral measures, foreign investment was encouraged, structural change embraced. And whereas as populism tends to be fiscally irresponsible \u2013 it is the politics of saying \u2018yes\u2019 and rarely of saying \u2018no\u2019 - the Thatcher governments\u2019 fiscal approach was thoroughly conservative, ensuring that we sought to live within our means, tightly controlling public spending and even allowing the tax burden to rise when necessary to get the public finances under control. A responsible government cannot agree to every spending proposal put in front of it. Nor can it afford to pursue every proposal for unfunded tax cuts. I am the first to argue the case for a competitive, pro-business tax system \u2013 I am very proud to be associated with our corporation tax reforms \u2013 but the idea that cutting taxes inevitably pays for itself is simply the right-wing equivalent of the magic money tree. He rejected claims that inequality was fuelling populism. In a long passage trying to explain why populism was increasing, he cited economic insecurity, social media, stagnating living standards and structural changes as among the causes. But he said he did not accept the common argument that rising inequality was part of the problem. He explained: There are many who argue that rising inequality is a driver for populism. I am a little cautious about this, at least in the context of the UK, simply for the reason that inequality (contrary to what nearly everyone thinks they know) is not, in fact, rising. As the IFS has pointed out, income inequality has remained pretty consistent since the 1990s and, since the great recession of the late 2000s, earnings growth has generally been greatest for lower earners. Here are the main points from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech and Q&amp;A at the Labour European elections campaign launch. Corbyn said he thought a second referendum on Brexit could be \u201ca healing process\u201d. (See 12.18pm.) He made the comment in his Q&amp;A after a speech in which he suggested that Labour would not back a people\u2019s vote on a Brexit deal it supported. (See 9.21am.) He played down claims that there has been progress towards compromise in the cross-party Brexit talks, saying it was \u201cdifficult negotiating with a disintegrating government\u201d. In his speech he said: So far in those talks, there has been no big offer, and the red lines remain. It\u2019s difficult negotiating with a disintegrating government, with cabinet ministers jockeying for the succession rather than working for an agreement. Subsequently, when asked how the talks were going in the Q&amp;A, he said: The talks that we are having with the government have been difficult because the government is in some degree of disarray itself. They are still ongoing. Our point is that we want to protect jobs, protect trade and protect those rights that we have obtained. We met again yesterday and there will be a further meeting coming up. But, quite honestly, the government has to move its red lines. We cannot go on having MV1, MV2, MV3 and then coming on for possibly an MV4, or a bill that we have yet to actually see. So we will continue with that. If not, the issue has to come back to parliament at the earliest possible opportunity. He said he expected a general election soon. (See 11.37am.) He refused to define Labour simply as a leave party or a remain party. (See 11.37am.) But the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush has answered this question for him. Corbyn said Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party should be seen as the \u201cno-deal\u201d party. Interestingly, he devoted much more of his speech to attacking the Brexit party than to attacking the Tories, or any other party - a sensible decision on the basis of polling suggesting that Farage is the biggest threat to Labour. (See 11.28am.) He admitted Labour was \u201ctrying to offer something to everyone over Brexit\u201d. (See 11.29am.) It was the only party trying to appeal to both those who voted leave and those who voted remain, he argued. He said the authorities probably needed more powers to tackle racist behaviour. (See 11.44am.) Here is the text of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech at the European elections campaign launch. And here is the Labour manifesto (pdf). I will post a full summary of the main points from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech and Q&amp;A soon. But here is what he said almost at the end of the press conference about how a second referendum could be a healing process. The view we put forward, the party conference put this forward, the national executive agreed this, [was] that we should include the option of having a ballot on a public vote on the outcome of the talks and negotiations on what we\u2019re putting forward. I would want that to be seen as a healing process, and bringing this whole process to a conclusion. Nothing is easy in this. But our essential message has to be to bring people together and that\u2019s the basis on which we\u2019ve approached both what we\u2019ve done in parliament and in the negotiations itself. This may have been the most intriguing thing Corbyn said all morning. Curiously, this is almost exactly what Tony Blair (normally the last person Corbyn would seek to follow) said on the subject of a second referendum last month. In an interview with the Institute for Government, Blair said: So when members of parliament are forced to come to a choice then I think at that point they will say, \u2018Ok, this what I think but I\u2019m not going to take the full responsibility so I\u2019m going to share responsibility with the people\u2019, and that allows a referendum to be a healing process. When Blair said this quite a few people thought he was deluded. The general view on a second referendum is that, whatever its merits, it would be a divisive process, rather than a healing one. When Labour\u2019s national executive committee restated Labour\u2019s second referendum policy recently in terms of support for the \u201coption\u201d of a public vote, the inclusion of that word was seen a sign that the party did not want to fully commit to one. It has long been assumed that Corbyn has very little enthusiasm for the idea. The words released overnight, implying Labour would not back a people\u2019s vote on a Brexit deal it favoured (see 9.21am), back this up, as does his call in the Q&amp;A for an early general election. (See 11.37am.) If there were an election, there would be no time to legislate for a second referendum. But in the answer quoted above Corbyn did seem to envisage a second referendum happening. But how would it be a healing process? One theory occasionally floated by the more pro-Brexit Labour types, such as the Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, has been that you could have a second referendum, but without remain as an option. A referendum on a Labour Brexit proposal, with the unappealing no deal as the only alternative? That might be one version of a second referendum that would bring the whole process to a conclusion, although at this point I have no idea if that is what was going through Corbyn\u2019s mind when he gave that answer. Corbyn is now taking three questions from non-journalists. Q: What can Labour do to improve the lives of children living in poverty? Corbyn says the problem with Brexit is that it has crowded out all other issues. Recently at PMQs he decided to ask about knife crime instead. And he has asked about other issues too. And he had thousands of people saying thank you for raising these topics. He says a recent report from the Commons education committee said children who had proper nursery education tended to do well. But children who did not get that were behind academically by year 11. That is why Labour is proposing more free nursery education. And it wants children to eat school meals together, and children to get an artistic education. After that, for older students, tuition fees should be ended, he says. Q: Do you agree that having a second referendum is undemocratic, because it ignores the wishes of the 17 million who voted to leave? Corbyn says the party has decided to back the option of a second referendum. He says he would like this to be seen as a \u201chealing process\u201d, and something that would bring \u201cthis whole process to a conclusion\u201d. Corbyn says second referendum could be a \u201chealing process\u201d. Q: What should we say to people angry because they want no deal? Corbyn says a no-deal Brexit would be terrible for manufacturing. Those who back no deal should \u201cthink it through\u201d, he says. Q: Is this election a watershed moment to tackle the far right? Corbyn says the rise of hate crime is very worrying. There is also a rise in violent crime and knife crime. There is an issue with police numbers, he says. The last Labour government introduced police support officers. But many police jobs have been lost. Community policing is important, he says. Corbyn says there is a rise in antisemitism across Europe, in countries such as Poland. He praises those, especially the young, who have stood up against this. Do we need more powers to challenge racist behaviour? Corbyn says we need to look at that, \u201cand I think we probably do\u201d. Corbyn says authorities probably need more powers to tackle racist behaviour. The abuse directed at people such as Muslim women is particularly unacceptable, he says. He says he is determined to bring people together. Q: Do you want the MEPs who are elected not to have to take their seats, like the government? Corbyn says Labour\u2019s message is not the same as the government\u2019s. Labour wants to end austerity. But, despite what Theresa May said at her party conference, that is not the government\u2019s position. Q: Do you think the Lib Dem slogan \u201cbollocks to Brexit\u201d is a helpful contribution to the debate? Corbyn says he wants to bring people together. He wants Labour MEPs to play their part in the European parliament as long as they are there. Q: You say leave or remain are unhelpful labels. But many in your party want it to be a remain party? Is it definitely a leave party? Or could it be a remain party? Corbyn says he fought the referendum on a remain and reform programme. But leave won. He summarises the sort of Brexit he wants. And he says the Labour manifesto includes the option of a public vote. Q: Why should voters turn out if they don\u2019t know whether you are a leave party or a remain party? Q: Do you accept that your stance on Brexit cost you votes in the local elections? Corbyn says he is appalled at the toxic nature of the Brexit debate. He says a future relationship with the EU should promote trade and protect rights. The alternative promoted by people such as Nigel Farage would involve a trade deal with the US that would allow American firms to take over the NHS. Corbyn says Labour would not allow that. He says he would accept a public vote at the end of the parliamentary process. As to the charge Labour\u2019s message is confusing, he says he does not accept that. He is looking forward to putting the case in a general election \u201cwhich cannot be that far away\u201d. The government cannot carry on like this, he says. Corbyn says general election \u201ccannot be that far away\u201d. Q: Are you making any progress in the cross-party talks? Corbyn says the government has to move its red lines. It cannot have another meaningful vote, or a bill, without that. Corbyn says Labour is trying to appeal to both sides on Brexit. It\u2019s said that Labour is trying to offer something to everyone over Brexit. I make no apology for that. Labour will never be the party of the 52% or of the 48%. We are the part of the great majority who reject the politics of smear and scapegoating. Corbyn turns to Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party, which he says is really the no-deal party. For millions, no deal would mean no jobs. An economic shock threatening entire industries. And here in Kent turning the M20 into a permanent lorry park, causing massive disruption. It would be an elite Brexit that would only work for the richest. Who wants to deregulate, slash public services and rights at work still further. It would be a Donald Trump Brexit leaving us at the mercy of a reckless and bellicose US administration. Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit is a Brexit for conspiracy theorists. For those who see Muslims and migrants or George Soros as the enemy. Only Labour can see off the Farage snake oil in this election. Corbyn says the biggest problems require international solutions. And the biggest issue of all the climate and environment emergency that threatens everyone\u2019s future cannot be averted by one country alone. Climate breakdown air pollution and the frightening loss of species demand collaboration across borders. And I am proud that Labour led the way last week to make the UK parliament be the first in the world to declare an environment and climate emergency. Corbyn says Labour will stand up for workers \u201cblack and white\u201d. It will guarantee the rights of EU workers and students in this country. We are internationalists to our core. Corbyn says Britain needs solutions, not scapegoats. When you blame your neighbour rather than the powerful for problems with the health system or for overcrowded classrooms or for a lack of housing you\u2019re letting those responsible off the hook. You haven\u2019t trained a doctor or a nurse, you haven\u2019t opened a new school, you haven\u2019t built a house, you haven\u2019t secured a penny of extra investment. All you\u2019ve done is fuel an atmosphere of division and nastiness. Corbyn goes on to explain what these problems are. While the government\u2019s incompetence and divisions over Brexit have created this deadlock the injustices in our society are deepening. Those injustices aren\u2019t to do with backstops, implementation periods and all that obscure jargon. They\u2019re about whether your children will go to a school that can afford the basics or one that has to send begging letters to parents. Whether your relatives will be treated quickly and safely on the NHS or wait in pain and distress for months. Whether your parents will get a helping hand in old age or be left isolated and afraid. And whether we as a country can end the burning injustices in our society that Theresa May once talked of but did nothing about. Austerity, insecure work and low wages cause anger and disillusion. Some want to use that to stoke further division. But it wasn\u2019t the EU that slashed public services to pay for tax cuts for the richest, it was Tory governments. It wasn\u2019t nurses and teachers who crashed our economy, it was the bankers and hedge funds. And it wasn\u2019t immigrants who caused the biggest squeeze on wages since the Napoleonic wars, it was bad employers. Corbyn says he has seen the divisions Brexit has caused. What should we do? You could continue with these divisions, he says, and living with labels that did not apply a few years ago. But who wants to go on like that, he asks. He says we should not ask first if people are leave or remain. We should ask what sort of society we want. And there is a lot of common ground on that, he says. The real divide is not between people who voted leave and remain. It is between the many and the few. Whether you live in a remain area or a leave area, the problems are the same, he says. Jeremy Corbyn says the government is trying to implement Brexit against a backdrop of division. Labour is the only party with a plan to unite the country, he says. He says Labour will end austerity, invest in communities and raise living standards. He says Labour has a plan to restore manufacturing industries and revive areas of the country that feel neglected. That neglect was a major cause of Brexit, he says. He says, as democratic socialists, they cannot ignore the results of the referendum. The party said in its election manifesto, and again at the Liverpool conference, that it would respect the result. But it cannot respect the government\u2019s handling of Brexit, he says. He says the Tories have spent three years arguing amonst themselves. It was only after the PM\u2019s deal was voted down three times that she agreed to discuss Brexit with Labour. So far, there has been no big offer in those talks. The red lines remain in place, he says. He says it is difficult negotiating with a \u201cdisintegrating government\u201d. Corbyn says it is hard for Labour to negotiate Brexit with a \u201cdisintegrating government\u201d. Jayne Baxter, a former MSP and a Labour MEP candidate in Scotland, is introducing Jeremy Corbyn. She says Labour is the only party trying to appeal to people on both sides of the Brexit argument. Jeremy Corbyn is about to launch Labour\u2019s European elections campaign. There is a live feed at the top of this blog. Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby has a useful round-up of all the other Tories who want to stand for the leadership. And here is the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg on Steve Baker\u2019s possible candidature. I have changed the headline at 10.09am, and the opening paragraph, after DExEU got in touch to say that Stephen Barclay\u2019s comment about \u201clazy thinking\u201d about Brexit was not directed at the EU specifically, but at what some people in general think about Britain leaving the EU. Sorry about that. Esther McVey, the Conservative Brexiter and former work and pensions secretary, has announced that she will stand for the Conservative leadership. McVey resigned from cabinet when the withdrawal agreement was announced in November last year, and this gives her considerable credibility with Tory Brexiters. She then voted against the withdrawal agreement in the first two Commons votes, before backing it in the third vote. In an interview with TalkRadio, she said: I have always said quite clearly if I got enough support from my colleagues, yes I would. Now people have come forward and I have got that support, so I will be going forward. McVey also said that Theresa May\u2019s departure should be handled in a \u201cdignified and graceful\u201d way. \u201cWe all know Theresa May is dutiful,\u201d she said. \u201cShe has worked for public service for many years.\u201d Gina Miller, the pro-European campaigner whose legal challenge forced the government to pass a bill allowing article 50 to be triggered, has launched a website encouraging people to vote tactically in the European elections for pro-remain parties. In a Guardian article, she explains why. Here\u2019s an extract. With the remain vote in effect divided between up to five parties \u2013 Change UK, the Lib Dems, Greens, Plaid Cymru and the SNP \u2013 [Nigel] Farage will be able to take victory for granted unless the playing field is levelled out. He and his rightwing backers know only too well that winning a sweep of MEP seats will be interpreted as a mandate for the Brexiteers, as they set about implementing the most extreme political ideology seen in this country in living memory. What is more, it would expand the bloc of rightwing MEPs with divisive and sinister global agendas sitting in the European parliament. I am therefore attempting to even the playing field by today launching Remain United, a tactical voting and campaigning website to give voters advice on which remain-backing party they would be best off supporting in order to maximise the number of seats these parties capture between them in the forthcoming election. And here is the article in full. And here is Miller\u2019s website, Remain United. Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay has said there is too much \u201clazy thinking\u201d on Brexit, as he claimed the 2016 vote to leave was driven by a desire to be \u201cmore global\u201d. He was speaking at a think-tank event in the Romanian city of Sibiu, hours before EU leaders gather - without Theresa May - to debate the future of the EU. The Sibiu summit, which falls on Europe day, has been billed as a moment to relaunch the European project after Brexit, ahead of elections at the end of the month. Barclay said he was frustrated with the common narrative on Brexit and accused people of of \u201clazy thinking\u201d. He said: I think too often there is lazy thinking, to be frank, on Brexit and a failure to look at that longer-term relationship between the United Kingdom and Europe. The 2016 vote was motivated by \u201cconfidence, optimism, a desire to be more global,\u201d Barclay said. \u201cIt certainly was not the Nigel Farage little-Englander portrayal.\u201d Speaking on a panel entitled \u2018new ambitions for the future of Europe\u2019, Barclay added: Brexit from my perspective is about shared values, wanting to have a political relationship, identifying shared challenges, but also being able to look forward, rather than to constantly hark back to a vote three years ago. The Brexit secretary, who also said Brexit was \u201can opportunity to be seized\u2019, was greeted with polite applause from the audience of politicians and EU experts, although also faced scepticism. \u201cBrexit, it\u2019s a lose lose agenda for the UK and for Europe,\u201d said fellow panellist Luca Jahier, president of the European Economic and Social Committee, a body for EU social partners. Another commentator in the room said listening to Barclay\u2019s speech made him think \u201cin a semi serious way\u201d that the UK was reconsidering its decision to leave. The person also added that \u201ca more flexible approach [from the EU] might have given the UK one more chance to stay in\u201d. Asked whether the UK faced challenges it could manage better outside the EU, Barclay said \u201cin politics you should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time\u201d as he called for a wide-ranging future relationship that went beyond trade, to cover shared interests on migration and security. He said the EU would be accepting \u201ca rather limiting relationship\u201d if it imposed too many constraints on the UK \u201cwhich has much to offer in terms of security\u201d. During the speech that discussed climate change, migration and Nato, he repeated the government\u2019s pledge that the UK\u2019s commitment to Europe\u2019s security was \u201cfundamental and unconditional\u201d. EU leaders meeting in the town hall of the picturesque Transylvanian city are expected to sign a declaration later on Thursday pledging to stick together through \u201cthick and thin\u201d. European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker originally proposed holding the summit on 30 March, the day after what should have been Brexit day. The event was moved to Europe day, long before the prime minister agreed to delay the UK\u2019s departure until 31 October. Juncker told an audience of students last night that the prime minister needed to \u201cplease speed up\u201d the Brexit process. He stand down as commission president at midnight on 31 October - the UK\u2019s rescheduled departure day. \u201cThe British are supposed to leave on the 31st of October and I told Theresa May \u2018I will leave at midnight so please speed up the process.\u2019\u201d UPDATE: We have corrected the opening paragraph, and the headline, after DExEU got in touch to say that Stephen Barclay\u2019s comment about \u201clazy thinking\u201d was not directed at the EU, but at what some people generally think about Brexit. David Gauke, the justice secretary, told the Today programme this morning that the Conservative party should stick with Theresa May as leader for the moment. \u201cI think it would be a mistake to have a change of leadership at this point,\u201d he said. Replacing May would not make it easier for the Conservatives to pass a Brexit deal, he suggested: I think the issue here is that her going isn\u2019t going to change the parliamentary arithmetic. Gauke also said that, when the Tories choose their next leader, the focus should be on \u201cwhat is the role of the UK in a post-Brexit world and who is the best candidate to defeat Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. Gauke was speaking before delivering a speech on the rise of populism, and what the Conservatives should do about it. I\u2019m just reading it now. It is not going to make the headlines, but it is more thoughtful than the usual \u201cwide-ranging speech\u201d we are getting from Tories seeking to influence the leadership contest at the moment and I will post a proper summary soon. Theresa May has confirmed the government will allocate \u00a3200m to fix private tower blocks wrapped in combustible Grenfell-style cladding, after mounting public anger against dozens of freeholders and developers who have refused to pay to make them safe, my colleague Robert Booth reports. Jeremy Corbyn is launching Labour\u2019s campaign for the European elections in Medway, Kent, this morning. And, according to the extracts from his speech sent out in advance, he is keen to shift the conversation away from Brexit. Here are the key points. Corbyn will seek to make the Euro elections about social justice, not Brexit. This is what the party says in its news release about the Labour manifesto. The manifesto \u2013 \u2018Transforming Britain and Europe: for the many not the few\u2019 \u2013 sets out Labour\u2019s plans to work across borders to take on the tax dodgers, the polluters and the migrant baiters of the far right. From taking urgent action on the climate emergency, to protecting and strengthening workers\u2019 rights, to facing down the far right, the manifesto speaks to the lives of people in Britain and across Europe. Corbyn will restate Labour\u2019s qualified support for a second referendum, implying he would not back a people\u2019s vote on a Brexit deal Labour supported. Corbyn will say: Labour\u2019s alternative plan for Brexit, which protects jobs, living standards and communities, would end the chaos caused by the Conservatives and let us focus on the other big issues facing our country. But we can never accept the government\u2019s bad deal or a disastrous no deal. So if we can\u2019t get a sensible deal, along the lines of our alternative plan, or a general election, Labour backs the option of a public vote. He will claim that Labour is the only party that can appeal to both remain supporters and leave supporters. He will say: To transform our country, and tackle injustice, inequality and the climate crisis, we need to unite the overwhelming majority of people and take on the privileged and powerful. That\u2019s why we insist the real divide in our country is not how people voted in the EU referendum. The real divide is between the many and the few. Whether you\u2019re from Tottenham or Mansfield, Stockwell or Stoke, here in Medway or in Manchester, so many of the problems you face are the same. Other parties appeal to just one side of the Brexit debate because they aren\u2019t really committed to taking on the tax dodgers, the big polluters, or the financial gamblers who crashed our economy a decade ago. Labour is the only party with a plan to unite our country to make it work for the many not the few. The danger with this argument, of course, is that there is now quite a lot of evidence suggesting that the real divide in Britain is not how people feel about the many and the few, but about whether they back leave or remain. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.45am: The Peoples\u2019 Vote campaign publishes a report saying leaving the EU but staying in a customs union would reduce national income by \u00a380bn a year compared to staying in. 10.45am: Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, gives a speech on the future of Conservatism. As Rowena Mason reports, she will say people should not fear robots taking over their boring and repetitive work when future jobs will be much more creative. 11am: Jeremy Corbyn launches Labour\u2019s campaign for the Euro elections. 3.30pm: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem deputy leader, speak at the launch of the new IPPR centre for economic justice. 12pm: The Brexit party unveils its candidate for the Peterborough byelection. It is Mike Greene, who featured in the Channel 4 programme Secret Millionaire. 2.15pm: David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, chairs a meeting of the joint ministerial committee with the devolved administrations. Afternoon: Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader and Scottish first minister, is launching the SNP\u2019s Euro elections campaign. The Lib Dems are also launching their Euro election campaign today, but the event will be this evening, out of my time. However, my colleagues Heather Stewart and Jessica Elgot have interviewed the Lib Dem leader, who reveals that his party\u2019s campaign slogan is \u201cBollocks to Brexit\u201d. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up, which will be slightly earlier than usual today, at about 4pm, because I\u2019ve got a meeting later.

Launching his party\u2019s manifesto for the European elections in Chatham, Kent, the Labour leader said voters should resist being defined simply as leavers or remainers. \u201cWe could allow ourselves to be defined only as \u2018remainers\u2019 or \u2018leavers\u2019 labels that meant nothing to us only a few years ago. But where would that take us? Who wants to live in a country stuck in this endless loop?\u201d he asked. In his speech to an audience of local activists at Kent University\u2019s Medway campus, he sought to shift the debate beyond Brexit, and return to some of the themes that played well for Labour during the 2017 general election campaign, including public spending cuts and workers\u2019 rights. \u201cSome people seem to look at the issue the wrong way round \u2013 they seem to think the first question is leave or remain, as if that is an end in itself.

The real divide is between the many and the few,\u201d he said. Unlike the resurgent Liberal Democrats, whose campaign manifesto has a \u201cbollocks to Brexit\u201d placard on its cover, Corbyn repeatedly stressed during his speech and in the Q&amp;A session afterwards that Labour would not pick a side. As democratic socialists, he said, Labour could not ignore the result of the 2016 referendum. \u201cWe\u2018re not trying to win the votes of just leavers, or just remainers. Instead, we\u2019re reaching out to everyone,\u201d he said. Chatham is in the South East region for the European elections; but Corbyn was introduced by one of the party\u2019s candidates in Scotland, Jayne Baxter. The message on the cover of Labour leaflets posted to households this week urges the public to \u201cvote Labour and tell the Tories you are fed up with their divisive austerity policies and incompetent government\u201d. The Labour group on Medway council made gains at last week\u2019s local elections, though the Conservatives remained in control, and Labour is taking its message to areas in which it would hope to translate that into seats at a general election. The Medway campus, where the launch was held, is in the Rochester and Strood constituency once held by Mark Reckless, the Conservative who defected to Ukip - and currently the seat of junior business minister Kelly Tolhurst, who won it in 2017 with a majority of just under 10,000. Talks with the government over a potential cross-party Brexit deal broke up on Wednesday night, with Labour striking a markedly more positive tone than in recent days. But Corbyn played down the prospects of an early breakthrough, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s actually quite difficult negotiating with a disintegrating government, with cabinet ministers jockeying for position. [But] it is in the country\u2019s interests to get this sorted, one way or the other.\u201d The one line in the Labour manifesto that refers to \u201cthe option of a public vote\u201d on a Brexit deal was the subject of a lengthy wrangle at a meeting of Labour\u2019s ruling national executive committee last week. Corbyn said he hoped that if there were a public vote, it would be a \u201chealing process\u201d. The 28-page document launched at the event covers a series of domestic issues, including Labour\u2019s pledge to reverse Tory spending cuts, and global challenges such as climate change, as well as a section on \u201ctackling the far right and building unity\u201d. Corbyn also said Labour was the only party that could combat the \u201csnake oil\u201d peddled by Nigel Farage. He accused the Brexit party leader of advocating a \u201cDonald Trump Brexit\u201d that would expose the UK to a \u201creckless and bellicose\u201d US. \u201cNigel Farage\u2019s Brexit is a Brexit for conspiracy theorists. For those who see Muslims and migrants or George Soros as the enemy. Only Labour can see off the Farage snake oil in this election. And stand by our country\u2019s values of tolerance, openness and diversity.\u201d He added: \u201cLabour will never be the party of the 52% or of the 48%. We are the part of the great majority who reject the politics of smear and scapegoating.\u201d Senior Labour figures, including the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, and the deputy leader, Tom Watson, who would have liked Labour to issue a full-throated call for a referendum, have been stressing the need to challenge the values of the Brexit party. On Wednesday, Watson told the second meeting of the Future Britain Group \u2013 the centre-left internal grouping he set up after the breakaway Change UK party was formed \u2013 that \u201cwhatever the different views on the response to the referendum in the room, these European elections are being seen and will be interpreted as pro- or anti-the Farage view of the country. That gives us something to fight for.\u201d While Corbyn launched the party\u2019s official campaign, a group of rebel leftwing MPs, including the shadow Treasury minister, Clive Lewis, have been touring the country holding \u201cLove socialism, hate Brexit\u201d rallies, at which they unequivocally demand a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d.",
