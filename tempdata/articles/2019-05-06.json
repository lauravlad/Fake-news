      "bodyText": "A Labour-backed report has called for the launch of universal basic income trials across the UK. Universal basic income (UBI), which takes the form of regular cash payments from the government to all adult citizens, has emerged as a popular concept in recent years because it could top up low pay and reduce inequality. A feasibility study commissioned by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said a pilot scheme would work in the UK. Although the report does not represent Labour policy, its publication is likely to be viewed as moving the party closer towards testing a form of UBI should it be voted into power. Welcoming the launch of the report on Tuesday, McDonnell said the study by professor Guy Standing, a member of the Progressive Economy Forum \u2013 a group of left-leaning economists \u2013 was an \u201cimportant contribution to the debate around inequality, austerity, poverty and how we establish a fair and just economic system\u201d. \u201cWhatever mechanism we use [to achieve this], whether \u2018basic income\u2019 or another, we have to lead in developing a radical mechanism aimed at eradicating poverty, but also means testing,\u201d he added. The new report, Basic Income as Common Dividends: Piloting a Transformative Policy, puts forward a roadmap for the introduction of UBI tests in Britain, which would follow several other countries around the world that have trialled basic income policies. Finland has conducted among the most extensive tests, although findings published earlier this year suggest that basic incomes did not materially help recipients to get a job. While a UBI could form part of a benefits system to support low-income workers and households, it could also replace unemployment benefits. The Scottish government has worked with the RSA thinktank to explore whether a UBI programme should be piloted. Headed by Matthew Taylor \u2013 who conducted a review into the gig economy for Theresa May \u2013 the thinktank is expected to publish the findings of its work in Scotland later this week. Anthony Painter, the director of action and research at the RSA, said that its work would \u201cshow how Scotland can proceed with its proposed pilots in a way that is progressive, affordable and would halve destitution\u201d. Supporters of UBI believe cash payments could help to support workers as advances in technology put growing numbers of jobs at risk. There are, however, fears that a UBI programme could dissuade people from seeking work. Some economists argue the money would help empower individuals, enabling them to invest in their skills or to start their own company, and to avoid becoming trapped in low-paid work. Others argue UBI would be too expensive and would be difficult to set at the right level, with higher spending on public servicesa more efficient alternative. Standing, an academic at SOAS, University of London, and a UBI specialist, suggested that the costs could be met by adapting or abolishing the system of personal tax allowances \u2013 similar to the findings of a study from the New Economics Foundation thinktank earlier this year. He also suggested a number of possible pilot scenarios, including providing an economically deprived community with a basic weekly income instead of existing means-tested benefits \u2013 with the exception of housing benefit. The pilots would include payments on a weekly or monthly basis to every person lawfully resident in the UK on an individual basis, paid without conditions on how the money is spent, or with any means testing to determine eligibility. The report said: \u201cIt could dramatically reduce poverty, insecurity and the use of food banks while saving on the bureaucracy of current social welfare administration.\u201d",

This is the largest fall anywhere except Australia.</p> <p>He also mentions, as a major cause, the replacement of people by machines as investment goods get cheaper. This has certainly been identified in the economic literature, as has Thomas Piketty\u2019s theory about levels of rent exceeding growth rates. However, recent research suggests that the real culprit is financialisation, and in particular the pressures on companies to use their profits to buy back their own shares or distribute them to shareholders, rather than invest them in plant, machinery, skills or research.</p> <p>This in turn suggests that any incoming government should target incentives on corporate investment by taxing corporate distributions even at the expense of equity valuation and returns.

This is the largest fall anywhere except Australia. He also mentions, as a major cause, the replacement of people by machines as investment goods get cheaper. This has certainly been identified in the economic literature, as has Thomas Piketty\u2019s theory about levels of rent exceeding growth rates. However, recent research suggests that the real culprit is financialisation, and in particular the pressures on companies to use their profits to buy back their own shares or distribute them to shareholders, rather than invest them in plant, machinery, skills or research. This in turn suggests that any incoming government should target incentives on corporate investment by taxing corporate distributions even at the expense of equity valuation and returns. This will produce squeals of horror from the City and the CBI, but it is the only sure way of reversing the growing inequality and inefficiency depicted by Elliott.

That is the date when the next general election is due to fall under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. There would be no independent trade policy in goods up to then.</p> <p>In the run-up to the 2022 general election, the political parties would be free to campaign for their own preferred future relationship with the EU.</p> <p>The Conservatives under a new leader might promise an arrangement that offers all the barrier-removing benefits of the current customs union but with the boon of global Britain being able to replicate the buccaneering pioneer spirit of old by regaining the ability to strike trade deals.</p> <p>Under the \u201cdual tariff\u201d proposal made in September 2018, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/02/michel-barnier-strongly-opposes-may-brexit-trade-proposals\">dismissed as \u201cinsane\u201d by the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier</a>, the UK would control its own tariffs but collect and pass on higher EU tariffs to Brussels for goods en route through the UK to the continent.</p> <p>Labour might offer the prospect of a permanent customs union with what it describes as a \u201cclose relationship with the single market\u201d without accepting free movement of people.</p> <p>Putting aside the flaws in both of those proposals \u2013 insane and unnegotiable \u2013 it is hoped that this compromise would convince just enough MPs of either party to hold their noses and vote for the deal.</p> <p>The problem is that it is all a mirage. Every day that the UK remains a member state is another day gone in which Whitehall could negotiate the future relationship while benefiting from its place in the single market and customs union as part of a 21-month transition period.</p> <p>There is much to negotiate with the EU. The deadline of 31 December 2020 will not give enough time.</p> <p>The withdrawal agreement foresees this problem. It offers an extension of the transition of up to two years to the end of 2022 \u2013 one the British government is likely to need to exploit to its fullest. The offer to Labour of a temporary customs union to 2022 is therefore irrelevant.</p> <p>For the Conservative backbenchers, meanwhile, the compromise does not offer freedom for the British government to do its own thing after 2022.</p> <p>The Irish backstop, involving the UK and the EU sharing a customs territory and Northern Ireland in effect staying in the single market, will kick in if there is no alternative arrangement for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. The Home Office has suggested that at best a technological solution for the border would not be operational until 2030.</p> <p>Even for those credulous enough to believe there was a real prospect of Labour \u201cbailing\u201d out the government, as the shadow trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, has described it, the apparent landing zone takes the political debate no further on from where it started.</p>",

The suggested compromise emerging over the weekend is that Labour and the Conservative government will agree to writing into the political declaration on the future relationship \u2013 the 26-page document that accompanies the 585-page withdrawal agreement \u2013 a commitment to negotiate a customs union with the EU covering goods that would last until 2022. That is the date when the next general election is due to fall under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. There would be no independent trade policy in goods up to then. In the run-up to the 2022 general election, the political parties would be free to campaign for their own preferred future relationship with the EU. The Conservatives under a new leader might promise an arrangement that offers all the barrier-removing benefits of the current customs union but with the boon of global Britain being able to replicate the buccaneering pioneer spirit of old by regaining the ability to strike trade deals. Under the \u201cdual tariff\u201d proposal made in September 2018, and dismissed as \u201cinsane\u201d by the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, the UK would control its own tariffs but collect and pass on higher EU tariffs to Brussels for goods en route through the UK to the continent. Labour might offer the prospect of a permanent customs union with what it describes as a \u201cclose relationship with the single market\u201d without accepting free movement of people. Putting aside the flaws in both of those proposals \u2013 insane and unnegotiable \u2013 it is hoped that this compromise would convince just enough MPs of either party to hold their noses and vote for the deal. The problem is that it is all a mirage. Every day that the UK remains a member state is another day gone in which Whitehall could negotiate the future relationship while benefiting from its place in the single market and customs union as part of a 21-month transition period. There is much to negotiate with the EU. The deadline of 31 December 2020 will not give enough time. The withdrawal agreement foresees this problem. It offers an extension of the transition of up to two years to the end of 2022 \u2013 one the British government is likely to need to exploit to its fullest. The offer to Labour of a temporary customs union to 2022 is therefore irrelevant. For the Conservative backbenchers, meanwhile, the compromise does not offer freedom for the British government to do its own thing after 2022. The Irish backstop, involving the UK and the EU sharing a customs territory and Northern Ireland in effect staying in the single market, will kick in if there is no alternative arrangement for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. The Home Office has suggested that at best a technological solution for the border would not be operational until 2030. Even for those credulous enough to believe there was a real prospect of Labour \u201cbailing\u201d out the government, as the shadow trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, has described it, the apparent landing zone takes the political debate no further on from where it started.",
