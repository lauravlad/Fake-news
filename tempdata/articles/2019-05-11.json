In a chilling assessment, the NCA\u2019s director general, Lynne Owens, said the threat from organised crime groups was at unprecedented levels. \u201cIt is chronic and corrosive.

Last year Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog revealed the jobs of 44,000 police officers and staff had been lost since 2010, when the coalition government came to power, and that the Home Office had failed to even forecast the possible impact. The writer Misha Glenny, who will chair a panel of senior officers at the NCA\u2019s report launch in London on Tuesday, said the austerity drive had allowed powerful crime syndicates to flourish in the UK. Glenny, whose book McMafia documented the globalisation of crime after the break-up of the Soviet bloc, said that when it was published in 2008 organised crime was viewed as a global concern and its impact on most British citizens was minimal. \u201cIn the past 10 years what is really striking is how this industry has grown inside the UK. Austerity has been absolutely critical in this, partly because of the reduction in police capacity but also because of the continuing increase in inequality.

Last year the agency mapped 4,629 OCGs (organised crime groups) inside the UK with tens of thousands of members and says the threat has since continued to grow. One area of enduring concern remains the use of encrypted and anonymisation technology, the latter primarily on the dark web, that have eroded the ability of investigators to detect offenders. On Saturday, the NCA celebrated the conclusion of an eight-year investigation by seizing \u00a36m worth of assets, including an award-winning luxury hotel and a \u00a3100,000 Bentley, from alleged members of an international money-laundering group. The assessment is also expected to warn that advances in technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the introduction of 5G, will present further potential opportunities for criminals. Uncertainty surrounding Brexit will also be identified by the agency as an area for criminal exploitation. Last year the NCA raised concerns that crime groups would exploit \u201cthe design and implementation of a new UK customs system, or increased challenges for EU and UK law enforcement in locating and extraditing international fugitives, if the UK were to lose enforcement or intelligence-sharing tools\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Change UK has written to the BBC to call for a full explanation of the decision not to air an episode of Have I Got News For You featuring its interim leader, Heidi Allen, claiming the broadcaster was providing Nigel Farage with unduly favourable coverage. The newly formed party also raised concerns over the fairness of the BBC\u2019s coverage of Change UK and demanded an urgent review of the decision to \u201cexclude\u201d them from a BBC Wales election debate on Sunday before the European elections. Change UK\u2019s campaign coordinator, Chris Leslie, raised concerns and referred to Nigel Farage\u2019s appearance on Have I Got News For You in 2014 in the run-up to the EU parliament elections, although it was unclear if this fell within the pre-election period. \u201cBritain\u2019s politics is broken and if we\u2019re going to fix it, people need a chance to hear from the full range of parties standing in the upcoming European elections \u2013 including Change UK with our support for a people\u2019s vote and remain,\u201d Leslie, the former Labour MP, wrote in a letter to the BBC director general, Tony Hall. \u201cThe BBC has a crucial role as our national broadcaster, but we\u2019re worried that over the past week, it\u2019s got a couple of big calls wrong. This is particularly concerning given that similar decision about Nigel Farage\u2019s appearances over the years appear to have gone the other way. \u201cToday, we\u2019re asking the BBC to look again and make sure it\u2019s not doing British voters a disservice by giving some parties more favourable treatment than others. \u201cI am specifically asking that you urgently review your decision to bar our party from the BBC Wales election candidates\u2019 debate, due to take place tomorrow [Sunday] morning. For your BBC Wales team to exclude Change UK in particular \u2026 is deeply unfair and will limit debate rather than allow it.\u201d On Friday evening, the BBC One comedy quiz show tweeted: The BBC referred to its editorial guidelines and said it would look to broadcast the episode at a later date. \u201cIt would be inappropriate to feature political party leaders on entertainment programmes during this short election period, which does not allow for equal representation to be achieved.\u201d It came after Farage, leader of the Brexit partymade his 33rd appearance as a panellist on BBC1\u2019s Question Time on Thursday. Allen, the MP for South Cambridgeshire, tweeted: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just not as funny as Nigel Farage eh? He\u2019s so funny, he seems to be on the BBC all the time! \u201cAn explanation would be appreciated, not least to acknowledge the hard work of the entire crew who worked diligently to put the show together.\u201d",
