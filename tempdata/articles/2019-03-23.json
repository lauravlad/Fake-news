      "bodyText": "The gates of the suburban mausoleum that could soon house Spain\u2019s most restless ghost are decked with a shrivelling bunch of red and yellow carnations, a handful of prayer cards and a cheap, broken crucifix. If the socialist government\u2019s long and fraught campaign to exhume Francisco Franco from the fascist splendour of the Valley of the Fallen finally succeeds, his body will be reinterred in June here in the humbler surroundings of the Mingorrubio-El Pardo municipal cemetery. The graveyard, which sits at the end of a bus route less than an hour from Madrid, lacks the baleful scale of Franco\u2019s current resting place. Not far from its entrance, an engine idles and a driver relieves himself against a wall. Mingorrubio boasts neither the basilica\u2019s sword-wielding angel sentries nor the 150 metre-high cross that draws coachloads of tourists, schoolchildren and those nostalgic for a half-remembered Spain. Nor, come to that, is it a mass grave crammed with the bodies of more than 30,000 people from both sides of the civil war. But the cemetery is home to the Franco family vault, where El Caudillo\u2019s wife, Carmen Polo, has lain since she died in 1988 \u2013 and to another dictator. Behind the black marble and Doric columns of a nearby mausoleum is the body of Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo, whose three-decade tyranny in the Dominican Republic ended when he was assassinated in an ambush outside Santo Domingo in 1961. Also buried across the cemetery is Franco\u2019s right-hand man, Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco. The admiral was on his way back from mass in Madrid in December 1973 when a massive bomb planted by the Basque terrorist group Eta blew his Dodge car more than 20 metres into the air and over the roof of the church where he had sat minutes earlier. In three months\u2019 time \u2013 the courts permitting \u2013 Franco will join Trujillo and Carrero Blanco and, in doing so, enable the country to shuffle a little closer towards confronting his legacy. The timing could not be better, nor, perhaps, worse. At the end of April, Spaniards will vote in a general election that is set to see Vox become the first avowedly far-right party to win seats in the national parliament since Spain returned to democracy. Vox, which broke through into the mainstream in last December\u2019s Andaluc\u00edan regional election, is big on slogans, short on details and shares much of its ideological DNA with Franco and his followers. Over recent months and weeks, the anti-immigration, anti-feminist party has called for a \u201creconquest\u201d of Spain, railed against \u201cfeminazis\u201d, and called for the expulsion of 52,000 \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d. Last week alone, it has raised the prospect of banning far-left political parties and those that push for Catalan independence\u2013 a particular bestia negra \u2013 and suggested that \u201cgood Spaniards\u201d should be allowed to possess weapons and use them in self-defence without having to face \u201chellish\u201d legal consequences. It is little wonder, then, that these are bittersweet times for those who suffered under Franco and who have long yearned to see him exhumed from the Valley of the Fallen. The activist, politician and writer Lidia Falc\u00f3n, now 83, was arrested seven times under Franco and tortured by his thugs. She was hung by her hands from a hook in the ceiling while they beat her abdomen and shouted: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to give birth any more, you whore!\u201d She makes no apology for using a familiar line on the valley. \u201cDo you think Hitler\u2019s remains would be kept in an enormous monument where his acolytes could go and pay their respects?\u201d she asks. \u201cWhere tourist and journalists would go? Do you think that people would pay out a huge sum for its upkeep? Can you imagine that? Well there you are.\u201d In\u00e9s Madrigal, 49, is one of the thousands of babies who were stolen from their birth mothers and placed with other families in a practice that began shortly after Franco\u2019s victory in the civil war and continued until well after his death in 1975. She, too, struggles to understand how Franco has managed to stay in his stately mausoleum. \u201cAll he did, as far as I\u2019m concerned, was cause a suffering so profound that we\u2019re still trying to find our way out of it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s created a huge division in Spain: some of us want to talk about this and others just don\u2019t.\u201d Falc\u00f3n snorts at any parallels between Franco\u2019s uprising in 1936 and the re-emergence of the far-right after a 40-year absence. But in Vox, \u201cwho have sprung up here overnight, like a mushroom in the woods\u201d, she discerns a familiar kind of politics. \u201cThey\u2019re the same people, except today it\u2019s their grandchildren,\u201d says Falc\u00f3n. \u201cA lot of fascists are rising to the surface now.\u201d She is not alone in her appraisal. In a recent interview, I\u00f1aki Gabilondo, perhaps Spain\u2019s best-known journalist, was asked how he would characterise Vox. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s Francoism,\u201d he told eldiario.es. \u201cI was 33 when Franco died. That means I\u2019d lived for 33 years \u2026 with Franco in my head, my heart, my world and my soul.\u201d Vox\u2019s \u201cultra-Spanish, ultra-centralised thinking, based on fatherland, God, Spain and old values\u201d, he added, was Francoism pure and simple. \u201cIt\u2019s something totally recognisable because I lived it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what we wanted to get rid of.\u201d The satirical magazine El Jueves has drawn equally explicit parallels. A recent cover showed the Vox leader, Santiago Abascal, driving a tank towards panicked citizens while wearing the uniform of the Spanish Legion, which was once led by Franco. A speech bubble read: \u201cAt last you\u2019ve managed to get Franco out of the Valley of the Fallen!\u201d Vox has criticised prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s efforts to exhume the dictator, arguing that he should be tackling Catalan independence and immigration rather than \u201cusing Spaniards as hostages in his policy of ideological propaganda\u201d. It is also drafting a controversial list of candidates. \u201cA WARNING to the MEDIA and PARTIES that are combing our lists and scanning our candidates,\u201d Abascal tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cYou won\u2019t find a single enemy of Spain. Nor a single ally of Spain\u2019s enemies. Nor will you find any trendy lefties, communists, separatists or wimps.\u201d What you will find, however, are two retired generals who last year signed a petition that claimed Franco had been vilified and which lamented the government\u2019s \u201cperverse\u201d attempts to exhume him. Also on the list, albeit briefly, was Fernando Paz, an author and speaker who believes \u201cthe majority of Jews in eastern Europe\u201d were shot dead rather than murdered in gas chambers, and that they died at the hands of local populations as well as German troops. Paz has also made a number of homophobic comments. His \u201cdenialist and revisionist\u201d remarks were condemned by Spain\u2019s Federation of Jewish Communities, which said his candidacy would have been unacceptable in other European countries where the trauma of the Holocaust has been properly addressed. Vox did not respond to requests for comment on its relationship with Francoism, nor on Paz\u2019s comments. But the party announced on Thursday night that he would no longer be standing as its candidate in Albacete. Pablo Sim\u00f3n, a political scientist at Madrid Carlos III University, counsels against direct comparisons between Vox and Francoism. Although Vox may draw support \u2013 not to mention candidates \u2013 from Franco nostalgists, it is very much a party of the new populist extreme right. \u201cVox isn\u2019t going to burn down parliament,\u201d says Sim\u00f3n. \u201cThat may sound ridiculous but it\u2019s not irrelevant \u2013 it\u2019s not like when fascists come to power and reject democratic and liberal mechanisms. What they will try to do, though, is twist things when it comes to which groups enjoy certain social rights, so they\u2019ll whip up fear of others, fear of integration and fear of Catalan nationalism. They\u2019ve already said they want to outlaw parties like Podemos or Catalan pro-independence parties.\u201d The issue of Catalan independence \u2013 which has provoked Spain\u2019s worst political crisis since the transition back to democracy \u2013 played a decisive role in Vox\u2019s Andaluc\u00edan breakthrough.

Both the 1977 law granting amnesty to those involved in crimes during the civil war and dictatorship, and the \u201cpact of forgetting\u201d, were intended to help the country move beyond Franco as quickly as possible. The dead, including Franco and the 100,000 people still buried in unmarked pits around the country, were left where they were in the belief that sealed graves would ensure sealed lips. But Spain has more mass graves than any country except Cambodia and there is an odd irony that a nation that frets so much \u2013 and usually so unnecessarily \u2013 about how it is viewed abroad should have continued to exalt one dead man while leaving so many others to rot into anonymity. The journalist and historian Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez de Miguel has just written a book documenting the 300 or so concentration camps through which an estimated 700,000 to one million Spaniards passed in the name of Francoist re-education. He understands why post-Franco Spain was willing to accept what he calls \u201ca series of shameful conditions, such as the pact of forgetting\u201d. The threat of a coup d\u2019etat was clear and present \u2013 and would eventually be fulfilled in 1981 \u2013 the 40-year dictatorship had whitewashed itself and the regime had also been tolerated by European democracies. But, he says, Spain\u2019s failure to confront its past has muddied its future. \u201cToday we\u2019re up against the kind of denial and revisionism that\u2019s condemned and prosecuted elsewhere in Europe.

Numerous sectors of the economy, from science and academia to the NHS, have been hit hard. And it\u2019s not just that EU nationals are turning their backs on the UK \u2013 in the year after the referendum, 17,000 Brits sought citizenship of another EU country, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/13/brexit-vote-creates-surge-in-eu-citizenship-applications\" title=\"\">according to figures collated from embassies</a>. The Brexodus is fully under way.</p> <p>A common refrain among the Brexiles I speak to is that they no longer recognise the country they grew up in. Raised in Northern Ireland, I\u2019ve always grappled with my national identity. I was born in west Belfast and have an Irish passport \u2013 yet until I moved across the UK border in Ireland to study at university, my cultural references were, by and large, British. I watched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/jan/09/gladiatorsisbackyouwillgo\" title=\"G\">Gladiators</a> on television and read The Famous Five.

I saw enough of the fallout from the Troubles to realise from an early age the dangers of unchecked patriotism. So when I moved to London, I refused to dwell on historical grievances and embraced everything that was great about the UK. In the 2012 Olympics, I felt a surge of pride for my adopted homeland.</p> <p>Nearly three years after the EU referendum, I no longer feel the same connection. A French friend, whose children were born in London, moved her family to Dublin last summer. She felt increasingly uncomfortable about the rise in xenophobia (Home Office figures showed that hate crimes rose by a third from 2016-2017) and wanted her daughters to be \u201craised European\u201d. Many Irish friends have returned home, too, uneasy with \u201cjokes\u201d made by colleagues and acquaintances about the Irish famine, shocked by the ignorance of many of their English peers.</p> <p>Nationalism isn\u2019t confined to the UK. Nearly half of young French voters backed the Front National leader, Marine Le Pen, in the country\u2019s 2017 general election. But aren\u2019t we better off wading through this mess together? When my husband and I lived in London, we became good friends with a neighbour, a retired diplomat in his 80s. He had loved serving his country, including a stint in the USSR during the cold war. These days, he no longer identifies as British, but as a citizen of the world. He saw postwar Europe unite and remembers the devastation that led to the formation of the EU.</p> <p>In a world of increasing uncertainty, I\u2019ll take a bunch of bureaucrats over going it alone any day \u2013 even if that means uprooting.

Josh and I were heavily involved in the remain campaign, turning our tiny flat into a hub on the day of the vote. At the time, I likened Brexit to the Scottish referendum, where everyone was panicking a few weeks beforehand but, when it came to it, voted for the safe option, the status quo.</p> <p>Afterwards, I went through a very unhealthy, spiteful stage that I\u2019m not quite out of yet. I stopped speaking to people who voted leave. One was a close friend, and I regret that now, but I\u2019m not sure how to get back in touch. Fellow campaigners went in a different direction. They thought they could stop Brexit and would say to me, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay and fight?\u201d But you can\u2019t fight battles that can\u2019t be won.</p> <p>Everyone keeps saying we don\u2019t know what people voted for. Of course we do: the main issue was immigration. I was born in Germany on a British army base and moved to the UK when I was seven. On my first day at school, the teacher mentioned my background and immediately there was this wave of xenophobia. So I always knew Britain had its populists, but I thought it had a liberal heart beating within.</p> <p>Berlin is my favourite city. It\u2019s so liberal, diverse and cheap, and there are plenty of jobs in tech, so it was a natural choice. I\u2019ve got Irish citizenship, as my grandparents were Irish, and my goal in the next few years is to become German. If Britain isn\u2019t in the EU, I\u2019ll have to surrender my citizenship and I am fine with that. We\u2019re lucky \u2013 some of our friends here have only British passports and are worried that they will be told to go home.</p> <p>Germans have a rose-tinted view of the British as being wonderfully polite and nice. They are sad about Brexit, but have moved on. The UK banked on everyone going, \u201cDon\u2019t leave! We\u2019re sorry we asked you to do the same thing every other country was doing!\u201d Maybe now the politicians will realise the world is bigger than Great Britain.</p> <p>Brexit is the failure of the progressives, rather than the work of the hard right, and that\u2019s what makes me sad. The left failed to challenge it and as a result, we\u2019re leaving the world\u2019s largest trading bloc. If Brexit has been good for anything, it has made people on the left realise how important it is to stand up for globalisation and cohesion.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

Josh and I were heavily involved in the remain campaign, turning our tiny flat into a hub on the day of the vote. At the time, I likened Brexit to the Scottish referendum, where everyone was panicking a few weeks beforehand but, when it came to it, voted for the safe option, the status quo. Afterwards, I went through a very unhealthy, spiteful stage that I\u2019m not quite out of yet. I stopped speaking to people who voted leave. One was a close friend, and I regret that now, but I\u2019m not sure how to get back in touch. Fellow campaigners went in a different direction. They thought they could stop Brexit and would say to me, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay and fight?\u201d But you can\u2019t fight battles that can\u2019t be won. Everyone keeps saying we don\u2019t know what people voted for. Of course we do: the main issue was immigration. I was born in Germany on a British army base and moved to the UK when I was seven. On my first day at school, the teacher mentioned my background and immediately there was this wave of xenophobia. So I always knew Britain had its populists, but I thought it had a liberal heart beating within. Berlin is my favourite city. It\u2019s so liberal, diverse and cheap, and there are plenty of jobs in tech, so it was a natural choice. I\u2019ve got Irish citizenship, as my grandparents were Irish, and my goal in the next few years is to become German. If Britain isn\u2019t in the EU, I\u2019ll have to surrender my citizenship and I am fine with that. We\u2019re lucky \u2013 some of our friends here have only British passports and are worried that they will be told to go home. Germans have a rose-tinted view of the British as being wonderfully polite and nice. They are sad about Brexit, but have moved on. The UK banked on everyone going, \u201cDon\u2019t leave! We\u2019re sorry we asked you to do the same thing every other country was doing!\u201d Maybe now the politicians will realise the world is bigger than Great Britain. Brexit is the failure of the progressives, rather than the work of the hard right, and that\u2019s what makes me sad. The left failed to challenge it and as a result, we\u2019re leaving the world\u2019s largest trading bloc. If Brexit has been good for anything, it has made people on the left realise how important it is to stand up for globalisation and cohesion. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",
