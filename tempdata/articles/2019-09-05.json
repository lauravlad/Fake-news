The Falklands and Gibraltar (a part of the EU) may be impacted most, but other UK overseas territories are also fearful of what comes next. All gain significant benefits from their association with the EU, particularly in relation to aid, free movement, and diplomatic access. Through EU support the territories in the Caribbean and Pacific have developed strong links with their neighbours; these too are now at risk. A recent House of Commons foreign affairs select committee report criticised the UK government for not doing enough to safeguard the interests of the territories; despite the fact that their populations are predominantly British. It is a bitter irony that those Conservative Brexiters who claim to be the strongest defenders of the territories are now precipitating a crisis that threatens their economic viability and security.<br><strong>Dr Peter Clegg</strong><br><em>University of the West of England </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Your article (Falkland Islanders fear crashing out will end their fishing boom, 3 September) on the likely impacts of a no-deal Brexit on the Falklands provides yet another illustration of the broad and largely undiscussed effects of what the UK government is threatening. The Falklands and Gibraltar (a part of the EU) may be impacted most, but other UK overseas territories are also fearful of what comes next. All gain significant benefits from their association with the EU, particularly in relation to aid, free movement, and diplomatic access. Through EU support the territories in the Caribbean and Pacific have developed strong links with their neighbours; these too are now at risk. A recent House of Commons foreign affairs select committee report criticised the UK government for not doing enough to safeguard the interests of the territories; despite the fact that their populations are predominantly British. It is a bitter irony that those Conservative Brexiters who claim to be the strongest defenders of the territories are now precipitating a crisis that threatens their economic viability and security.

A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/election-date-labour-consulting-on-whether-to-go-long-or-short\" title=\"\">debate is ongoing</a> within Labour as to when that can be known \u2013 whether there can be an election before an extension has been agreed, or whether it needs to come after.</p> \n<p>The government last night <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/brexit-lords-agree-to-push-through-bill-preventing-no-deal-by-end-of-friday\" title=\"\">called off its efforts</a> to filibuster the cross-party bill to legislate against a no-deal Brexit in the House of Lords. The plan to talk the bill out in the Lords \u2013 which led several peers to turn up with sleeping gear and razors in preparation for a long shift \u2013 had been seen as a long shot but worth a try.</p> \n<p>For the filibustering to be called off is in theory strange optics from a government hell-bent on proving it has done everything possible to fight a delay to Brexit. What the government is trying to do, however, is remove Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s excuse for refusing to agree to a general election.</p> \n<p>In the Commons chamber on Wednesday night, Corbyn suggested Labour would back an election as soon as the extension legislation had received royal assent. This ought to now happen by Monday, meaning Johnson can once again seek support for an early election. Should Corbyn refuse, he can go on the attack and ask Corbyn what he is waiting for. Expect more calls of chicken.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c4ad9ce6-3cda-4a5e-8ba3-5b6253ec48c1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ks9XnbesWCo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, figures in the Conservative party privately voice concern with the strategy. \u201cI am getting the sense that we might have messed this one up,\u201d sighs one Conservative MP. While Dominic Cummings used his Wednesday night meeting with special advisers to make clear that he remained confident an election was imminent, Labour could opt for other tactics. Corbyn is under pressure from figures including Keir Starmer to hold off on an early election until after an extension has been requested on 19 October.</p> \n<p>So, what options is the government considering? With Labour\u2019s support, Johnson could on Monday call an election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act and seek the backing of two-thirds of the Commons. However, anti-no-deal campaigner Nick Boles has suggested John Bercow could block such a move so soon after his first attempt failed.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s talk within government of proposing a one-line bill that would say something along the lines of \u201cnot withstanding the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, there will be an election on 15 October\u201d. That would require a simple majority \u2013 and the SNP has suggested it could back such a measure. However, what\u2019s troubling government figures is that such a vote would be amendable and after a mass operation to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/tory-mps-to-seek-legal-advice-after-having-whip-withdrawn\" title=\"\">withdraw the whip from Tory Brexit rebels</a> this week, Johnson is far short of a working majority. One member of government tells me they fear an amendment could be added to try to change the date \u2013 or reduce the voting age to 16. \u201cThey could make the circumstances for an election very difficult for us.\u201d</p> \n<p>Should Labour resistance continue and a bill be viewed as too risky, there are a handful of other options Johnson could try. There\u2019s some talk in the party of Johnson trying to call a confidence motion in himself \u2013 would Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour really want to go on the record saying they had confidence in a Tory prime minister?</p> \n<p>Or, if the bill reaches royal assent and there is pressure on Johnson to request a delay, he could simply refuse and see what his critics do. Launch a legal challenge? Perhaps.</p> \n<p>But the one thing Downing Street is adamant about is that Johnson will not request a Brexit delay in any shape or form. Should push come to shove, the prime minister could resign rather than go through with it. Johnson could suggest that the Queen ask Corbyn to request and sign any extension, thereby putting pressure on the remain alliance, and highlighting rifts over a so-called government of national unity. Such a move would also be seized on by Tories in an eventual election as proof Corbyn was against Brexit. In the topsy-turvy world of Brexit, the unthinkable is now possible.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor</p>",

As Boris Johnson put it \u2013 with glee \u2013 to Jeremy Corbyn in the chamber on Wednesday night after the prime minister\u2019s motion for a general election failed to win sufficient support: \u201cThis is the first time in history that the opposition has voted to show confidence in Her Majesty\u2019s government.\u201d The Labour leader has suggested he won\u2019t back the election he craves until he is certain the imminent threat of a no-deal Brexit has been averted. A debate is ongoing within Labour as to when that can be known \u2013 whether there can be an election before an extension has been agreed, or whether it needs to come after. The government last night called off its efforts to filibuster the cross-party bill to legislate against a no-deal Brexit in the House of Lords. The plan to talk the bill out in the Lords \u2013 which led several peers to turn up with sleeping gear and razors in preparation for a long shift \u2013 had been seen as a long shot but worth a try. For the filibustering to be called off is in theory strange optics from a government hell-bent on proving it has done everything possible to fight a delay to Brexit. What the government is trying to do, however, is remove Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s excuse for refusing to agree to a general election. In the Commons chamber on Wednesday night, Corbyn suggested Labour would back an election as soon as the extension legislation had received royal assent. This ought to now happen by Monday, meaning Johnson can once again seek support for an early election. Should Corbyn refuse, he can go on the attack and ask Corbyn what he is waiting for. Expect more calls of chicken. However, figures in the Conservative party privately voice concern with the strategy. \u201cI am getting the sense that we might have messed this one up,\u201d sighs one Conservative MP. While Dominic Cummings used his Wednesday night meeting with special advisers to make clear that he remained confident an election was imminent, Labour could opt for other tactics. Corbyn is under pressure from figures including Keir Starmer to hold off on an early election until after an extension has been requested on 19 October. So, what options is the government considering? With Labour\u2019s support, Johnson could on Monday call an election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act and seek the backing of two-thirds of the Commons. However, anti-no-deal campaigner Nick Boles has suggested John Bercow could block such a move so soon after his first attempt failed. There\u2019s talk within government of proposing a one-line bill that would say something along the lines of \u201cnot withstanding the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, there will be an election on 15 October\u201d. That would require a simple majority \u2013 and the SNP has suggested it could back such a measure. However, what\u2019s troubling government figures is that such a vote would be amendable and after a mass operation to withdraw the whip from Tory Brexit rebels this week, Johnson is far short of a working majority. One member of government tells me they fear an amendment could be added to try to change the date \u2013 or reduce the voting age to 16. \u201cThey could make the circumstances for an election very difficult for us.\u201d Should Labour resistance continue and a bill be viewed as too risky, there are a handful of other options Johnson could try. There\u2019s some talk in the party of Johnson trying to call a confidence motion in himself \u2013 would Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour really want to go on the record saying they had confidence in a Tory prime minister? Or, if the bill reaches royal assent and there is pressure on Johnson to request a delay, he could simply refuse and see what his critics do. Launch a legal challenge? Perhaps. But the one thing Downing Street is adamant about is that Johnson will not request a Brexit delay in any shape or form. Should push come to shove, the prime minister could resign rather than go through with it. Johnson could suggest that the Queen ask Corbyn to request and sign any extension, thereby putting pressure on the remain alliance, and highlighting rifts over a so-called government of national unity. Such a move would also be seized on by Tories in an eventual election as proof Corbyn was against Brexit. In the topsy-turvy world of Brexit, the unthinkable is now possible. \u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor",

Later, the One Nation group of Tory MPs, which includes cabinet minister Amber Rudd and Nicky Morgan, formally wrote to Johnson seeking their reinstatement.",

After Gove moved from opposition to head up the Department for Education in 2010, Cummings was initially kept at arm\u2019s length, but shortly after he formally joined the department in 2011,<strong> </strong>allegations of him intimidating civil servants began to emerge. They were denied, but it is a pattern some see repeated now in his treatment of Khan and his reported response to fellow special advisers that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/30/sajid-javid-confronts-boris-johnson-over-advisers-sacking\" title=\"\">if they didn\u2019t like his methods they could \u201cfuck off\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Yet the idea that he picks on women is, say those who have worked with him, untrue. \u201cIf he likes you and thinks you\u2019re on side, he\u2019ll work very effectively with you; if he thinks you\u2019re disloyal or useless, he can be extremely unpleasant, but he did that to men and women,\u201d says a longstanding former colleague. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a woman problem, I think it\u2019s a \u2018people he doesn\u2019t like\u2019 problem.\u201d</p> <p>His pet hates include perceived stupidity, laziness, or ideas being blocked for seemingly vague reasons, which may explain No 10\u2019s sudden appetite for ripping up unwritten rules and conventions. But Cummings was close to like-minded female members of the Gove set, including the free schools champion Rachel Wolf (married to his old friend, the lobbyist James Frayne) and the adviser Elena Narozanski, now back in No 10 advising on education; he also rated civil servant Victoria Woodcock highly enough to recruit her as Vote Leave\u2019s director of operations, arguing subsequently that, without her, they might not have won.</p> <p>\u201cOf all the accusations you could hurl at him, being a sexist is actually the least of it,\u201d says Gisela Stuart, the former Labour MP who chaired Vote Leave. \u201cWith Dom, you deliver or you don\u2019t deliver; things are good if you do, and not good if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Nor has there ever been a whiff of personal sleaze around Cummings, by all accounts happily married to the journalist Mary Wakefield. The same, however, cannot be said for his boss.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6255fefbc2b3a4cfc0ee31e802cabd195a33a4cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6255fefbc2b3a4cfc0ee31e802cabd195a33a4cf/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tory MP Mark Field manhandled a protester at a City dinner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tory MP Mark Field manhandled a protester at a City dinner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The plot of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/jul/26/theatre\" title=\"\">Who\u2019s the Daddy?</a>, a bedhopping farce that made its London theatrical debut in 2005, would have been so preposterous as to be incredible had it not been based on a series of real-life scandals that beset the Spectator magazine during a single year of Johnson\u2019s editorship. Co-written by the magazine\u2019s theatre critic Toby Young, it featured not only Johnson\u2019s affair with the columnist Petronella Wyatt \u2013 which ended in him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/nov/14/uk.conservatives\" title=\"\">being fired</a> from the Tory frontbench for lying about it \u2013 but the Spectator publisher Kimberly Quinn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/mar/06/uk.davidblunkett\" title=\"\">affair with the cabinet minister David Blunkett</a> and the then deputy editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jul/11/pressandpublishing.uknews\" title=\"\">Rod Liddle\u2019s extramarital affair</a> with a 22-year-old receptionist.</p> <p>Liddle\u2019s now ex-wife, the broadcaster Rachel Royce, subsequently attacked what she called an \u201call lads together\u201d culture at the magazine; in Sonia Purnell\u2019s biography Just Boris, she describes famously riotous champagne-fuelled parties \u201cfull of young things in short dresses, high heels and lipstick and the men flirting with them and ignoring their wives. I just felt that Boris was running the whole place like a knocking shop.\u201d None of this stopped Johnson being elected mayor in 2008.</p> <p>His move to London City Hall initially heralded a more statesmanlike phase (although within a year he was to begin an relationship with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/21/boris-johnson-fathered-child-affair\" title=\"\">unpaid arts adviser Helen Macintyre)</a>. While most of his senior appointments were male, a recurring theme in his career, he did hire the highly regarded transport expert Isabel Dedring, plus a bright young Oxford graduate named Munira Mirza to cover culture (Mirza now runs his policy unit at No 10).</p> <p>\u201cI look at him now and he\u2019s got a bunch of lads around him,\u201d says a colleague from that era. \u201cBut it was much more balanced in those days. They weren\u2019t the kind of women who would put up with any mischief.\u201d Yet Jennette Arnold, leader of the London Assembly Labour group, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/22/boris-johnson-denies-being-sexist\" title=\"\">publicly complained</a> of his \u201cdisrespectful, patronising way at meetings\u201d with female assembly members, while some City Hall staff recall a boys\u2019 school culture of risque jokes and Oxbridge ties.</p> <p>Throughout his career, Johnson has tended to get on with a certain type of woman; robust, not overly politically correct, dismissive of liberal shibboleths. Mirza famously criticised May\u2019s audit of racial disparities in public services as <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/09/theresa-mays-phoney-race-war-is-dangerous-and-divisive/\" title=\"\">self-flagellatory</a>, and the new Downing Street recruit Chloe Westley, now heading Johnson\u2019s social media team, <a href=\"https://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2018/11/chloe-westley-jordan-peterson-not-modern-feminists-speaks-for-me.html\" title=\"\">argued in a recent article defending the academic Jordan Peterson</a> against charges of misogyny that young women had been \u201cmisled by feminists\u201d into thinking they faced discrimination over pay.</p> <p>His inner circle in Downing Street, meanwhile, remains resolutely male compared with Cameron\u2019s or May\u2019s: this week\u2019s spending review was presented, unusually, by an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-treasury#content\" title=\"\">all-male Treasury ministerial lineup</a> despite concerns about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/28/women-austerity-and-the-spending-review\" title=\"\">impact of excluding women from economic policy-making</a>.</p> <p>As Dr Mary Ann Stephenson, head of the Women\u2019s Budget Group, which analyses the gender impact of economic policy, points out, it has been accepted wisdom for years now that ministerial teams should be mixed in order to better reflect the reality of ordinary lives: \u201cI can\u2019t understand why this lesson needs to be relearned. I remember talking about this in the 90s.\u201d But the emerging hallmark of the Johnson regime is that no conventional wisdom should be taken for granted, perhaps particularly not in the wake of a female PM many female voters did not feel served them well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e22e27d35fe692c19797a3c309171aca8428e420\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e22e27d35fe692c19797a3c309171aca8428e420/39_1095_2206_1324/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The remain campaign fielded an all-female team \u2013 Nicola Sturgeon, Angela Eagle and Amber Rudd \u2013 to debate with Johnson on TV.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The remain campaign fielded an all-female team \u2013 Nicola Sturgeon, Angela Eagle and Amber Rudd \u2013 to debate with Johnson on TV.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Frost/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the remain campaign confirmed it was fielding an all-female team of Amber Rudd, Nicola Sturgeon and Angela Eagle for a televised referendum debate against Boris Johnson, the rationale seemed obvious; they judged female voters to be his achilles heel. Rudd\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-1298192/Amber-Rudd-Boris-not-man-want-driving-home.html\" title=\"\">jibe</a> that Boris might be fun at a party, but wasn\u2019t the man to drive you home \u2013 seen as a deliberate dig at his private life \u2013 was deemed the zinger of the night and she was acclaimed a Tory leader-in-waiting. But three years on, she serves in Johnson\u2019s cabinet, awkwardly dodging questions about why she won\u2019t rule out a no-deal Brexit, a reminder that Johnson\u2019s supposed \u201cwoman problem\u201d is more complicated than it looks.</p> <p>His net favourability rating is indeed higher among men than among women, with <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/08/06/who-makes-boris-coalition\" title=\"\">YouGov reporting a gap of eight points in August</a>. But that may at least partly reflect the fact that women were more likely to vote remain in 2016, and are now more anxious about a no-deal Brexit. Dig deeper, and there is surprisingly little hard evidence that Johnson\u2019s behaviour specifically alienates female voters.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s just not much evidence to suggest that women feel differently from men about him,\u201d says Deborah Mattinson, CEO of Britain Thinks, which will next week publish the findings of focus groups conducted with women in Reading and Liverpool. \u201cThe big divide is age \u2013 older people like him more than younger ones, and leavers like him more than remainers.\u201d Both sexes question his integrity, she says, but find him charismatic; focus groups generally shrug off the breakdown of his marriage to wife Marina or his new girlfriend Carrie Symonds\u2019 move into No 10. \u201cThey\u2019ll say: \u2018Look, this is 2019, people don\u2019t necessarily live happily ever.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17617f544549ad17454ab8a3c7f0afd247d70907\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17617f544549ad17454ab8a3c7f0afd247d70907/0_0_4747_3165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnson in 2015 when mayor of London, with Jennette Arnold and members of the British armed forces.)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson in 2015 when mayor of London, with Jennette Arnold and members of the British armed forces.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such stories may strengthen the resolve of women who are already hostile to the Tories to support opposition parties, which helps to explain why Labour systematically seeks to portray him as a casual misogynist. But it may not actively shift votes in a snap election where Brexit overshadows everything.</p> <p>Yet if the Khan affair has any lingering significance, it is in uniting the charge \u2013 fair or unfair \u2013 of sexism, with the idea of a regime playing fast and loose with the rules, rather like a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/26/how-to-speak-silicon-valley-decoding-tech-bros-from-microdosing-to-privacy\" title=\"\">tech bro startup</a> whose culture of being too hip for HR soon turns toxic. \u201cIt fits with the narrative that the government doesn\u2019t have to obey the law; they\u2019re going to prorogue parliament if they want, they\u2019re not sure if they\u2019re going to follow employment law, the law is for everyone else and not for them,\u201d says a female former Tory staffer. Some will always thrill to the idea that rules exist to be broken. But not, perhaps, those the rules are made to protect.</p>",

But Cummings was close to like-minded female members of the Gove set, including the free schools champion Rachel Wolf (married to his old friend, the lobbyist James Frayne) and the adviser Elena Narozanski, now back in No 10 advising on education; he also rated civil servant Victoria Woodcock highly enough to recruit her as Vote Leave\u2019s director of operations, arguing subsequently that, without her, they might not have won. \u201cOf all the accusations you could hurl at him, being a sexist is actually the least of it,\u201d says Gisela Stuart, the former Labour MP who chaired Vote Leave. \u201cWith Dom, you deliver or you don\u2019t deliver; things are good if you do, and not good if you don\u2019t.\u201d Nor has there ever been a whiff of personal sleaze around Cummings, by all accounts happily married to the journalist Mary Wakefield. The same, however, cannot be said for his boss. The plot of Who\u2019s the Daddy?, a bedhopping farce that made its London theatrical debut in 2005, would have been so preposterous as to be incredible had it not been based on a series of real-life scandals that beset the Spectator magazine during a single year of Johnson\u2019s editorship. Co-written by the magazine\u2019s theatre critic Toby Young, it featured not only Johnson\u2019s affair with the columnist Petronella Wyatt \u2013 which ended in him being fired from the Tory frontbench for lying about it \u2013 but the Spectator publisher Kimberly Quinn\u2019s affair with the cabinet minister David Blunkett and the then deputy editor Rod Liddle\u2019s extramarital affair with a 22-year-old receptionist. Liddle\u2019s now ex-wife, the broadcaster Rachel Royce, subsequently attacked what she called an \u201call lads together\u201d culture at the magazine; in Sonia Purnell\u2019s biography Just Boris, she describes famously riotous champagne-fuelled parties \u201cfull of young things in short dresses, high heels and lipstick and the men flirting with them and ignoring their wives. I just felt that Boris was running the whole place like a knocking shop.\u201d None of this stopped Johnson being elected mayor in 2008. His move to London City Hall initially heralded a more statesmanlike phase (although within a year he was to begin an relationship with unpaid arts adviser Helen Macintyre). While most of his senior appointments were male, a recurring theme in his career, he did hire the highly regarded transport expert Isabel Dedring, plus a bright young Oxford graduate named Munira Mirza to cover culture (Mirza now runs his policy unit at No 10). \u201cI look at him now and he\u2019s got a bunch of lads around him,\u201d says a colleague from that era. \u201cBut it was much more balanced in those days. They weren\u2019t the kind of women who would put up with any mischief.\u201d Yet Jennette Arnold, leader of the London Assembly Labour group, publicly complained of his \u201cdisrespectful, patronising way at meetings\u201d with female assembly members, while some City Hall staff recall a boys\u2019 school culture of risque jokes and Oxbridge ties. Throughout his career, Johnson has tended to get on with a certain type of woman; robust, not overly politically correct, dismissive of liberal shibboleths. Mirza famously criticised May\u2019s audit of racial disparities in public services as self-flagellatory, and the new Downing Street recruit Chloe Westley, now heading Johnson\u2019s social media team, argued in a recent article defending the academic Jordan Peterson against charges of misogyny that young women had been \u201cmisled by feminists\u201d into thinking they faced discrimination over pay. His inner circle in Downing Street, meanwhile, remains resolutely male compared with Cameron\u2019s or May\u2019s: this week\u2019s spending review was presented, unusually, by an all-male Treasury ministerial lineup despite concerns about the impact of excluding women from economic policy-making. As Dr Mary Ann Stephenson, head of the Women\u2019s Budget Group, which analyses the gender impact of economic policy, points out, it has been accepted wisdom for years now that ministerial teams should be mixed in order to better reflect the reality of ordinary lives: \u201cI can\u2019t understand why this lesson needs to be relearned. I remember talking about this in the 90s.\u201d But the emerging hallmark of the Johnson regime is that no conventional wisdom should be taken for granted, perhaps particularly not in the wake of a female PM many female voters did not feel served them well. When the remain campaign confirmed it was fielding an all-female team of Amber Rudd, Nicola Sturgeon and Angela Eagle for a televised referendum debate against Boris Johnson, the rationale seemed obvious; they judged female voters to be his achilles heel. Rudd\u2019s jibe that Boris might be fun at a party, but wasn\u2019t the man to drive you home \u2013 seen as a deliberate dig at his private life \u2013 was deemed the zinger of the night and she was acclaimed a Tory leader-in-waiting. But three years on, she serves in Johnson\u2019s cabinet, awkwardly dodging questions about why she won\u2019t rule out a no-deal Brexit, a reminder that Johnson\u2019s supposed \u201cwoman problem\u201d is more complicated than it looks. His net favourability rating is indeed higher among men than among women, with YouGov reporting a gap of eight points in August. But that may at least partly reflect the fact that women were more likely to vote remain in 2016, and are now more anxious about a no-deal Brexit. Dig deeper, and there is surprisingly little hard evidence that Johnson\u2019s behaviour specifically alienates female voters. \u201cThere\u2019s just not much evidence to suggest that women feel differently from men about him,\u201d says Deborah Mattinson, CEO of Britain Thinks, which will next week publish the findings of focus groups conducted with women in Reading and Liverpool. \u201cThe big divide is age \u2013 older people like him more than younger ones, and leavers like him more than remainers.\u201d Both sexes question his integrity, she says, but find him charismatic; focus groups generally shrug off the breakdown of his marriage to wife Marina or his new girlfriend Carrie Symonds\u2019 move into No 10. \u201cThey\u2019ll say: \u2018Look, this is 2019, people don\u2019t necessarily live happily ever.\u2019\u201d Such stories may strengthen the resolve of women who are already hostile to the Tories to support opposition parties, which helps to explain why Labour systematically seeks to portray him as a casual misogynist. But it may not actively shift votes in a snap election where Brexit overshadows everything. Yet if the Khan affair has any lingering significance, it is in uniting the charge \u2013 fair or unfair \u2013 of sexism, with the idea of a regime playing fast and loose with the rules, rather like a tech bro startup whose culture of being too hip for HR soon turns toxic. \u201cIt fits with the narrative that the government doesn\u2019t have to obey the law; they\u2019re going to prorogue parliament if they want, they\u2019re not sure if they\u2019re going to follow employment law, the law is for everyone else and not for them,\u201d says a female former Tory staffer. Some will always thrill to the idea that rules exist to be broken. But not, perhaps, those the rules are made to protect.",
