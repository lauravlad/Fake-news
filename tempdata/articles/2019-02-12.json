My son has been flying over and shooting his beloved cattle for several days, which is absolutely gutting \u2013 he has grown up with them, their parents, their grandparents and great-grandparents. Helicopters are being used to distribute what fodder we have available to the survivors and right now this is our only form of transportation. The majority of the region is still inaccessible to vehicles and will be for some time.</p> \n<p>The scale of devastation here and throughout the north-west is impossible to put into words. There are estimates of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/11/up-to-500000-drought-stressed-cattle-killed-in-queensland-floods\">hundreds of thousands of domestic livestock having been lost so far</a> during this disaster and it is impossible to put into numbers the impact on the region\u2019s native wildlife. In some of our paddocks we are facing a 95% loss and on average we are estimating approximately 50% losses over all of our family\u2019s flood-affected properties, encompassing approximately 120,000 acres.</p> \n<p>Our cattle have been in a significant supplement feeding program, having withstood the last seven years of relative drought. As a result of this our girls were in great condition and we were seeing the beginning of another exceptional crop of calves. Almost overnight we have transitioned from relative drought years to a flood disaster zone. No amount of preparation could have readied our herd for the relentless driving rain and near gale-force winds they had to endure.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8d93bf02-ed3e-4a58-9b2f-ae92b988a6a8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4RbMPNixX6c?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On day eight the creek by our houses had dropped and slowed just enough for Robert and Kate to swim across and check on some cows close by. The heartbreaking scene they were confronted with on the other side very quickly turned our fears into the horrific nightmare that not only our family but our extended family, the whole of the north-west, are now battling with. It is unfathomable that our ladies in such a short period of time have lost roughly an incredibly 50% of their body weight. The survivors are a mere shadow of the strong healthy animals they were only a fortnight ago.</p> \n<p>As we begin to access our paddocks we are being confronted with death and devastation at every turn. There are kangaroos dead in trees and fences, birds drowned in drifts of silt and debris and our beloved bovine family lay perished in piles where they have been huddling for protection and warmth. This scene is mirrored across the entire region, it is absolutely soul-destroying to think our animals suffered like this.</p> \n<p>The scale of destruction this disaster has left in its wake we are only just beginning to discover. The sheer amount of storm water that engulfed the region has demolished fences, exposed pipelines, destroyed water infrastructure, created huge gullies that were once only small seasonal streams, turned roads into rivers and washed dam banks away. Our dam, which was an amazing refuge for birdlife and where I spent many peaceful hours watching them, has been destroyed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"fd17e3fb4c1b14ee11fec2cac918c2ea25bf5804\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd17e3fb4c1b14ee11fec2cac918c2ea25bf5804/0_0_3543_2365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"dead cattle in Queensland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This event was on the same scale as a blizzard in America, no warning, absolutely nothing that could be done to save these animals that just walked in this \u201ccyclone over land\u201d.

Many homestead complexes have been completely submerged. Here we have been lucky \u2013 our houses, sheds and out buildings have remained relatively dry. Others will have lost everything, facing an enormous clean-up on the home front, not just out in the paddock.</p> \n<p>Right now \u2013 I\u2019m sure I am speaking on behalf of everyone affected \u2013 our focus is entirely on the welfare of our animals. In the coming weeks when the surviving animals no longer require our constant care, our focus will shift to the colossal task of clean-up, repair and rebuilding where possible. This will also be the time where many will start the gruelling task of tallying up the horrific financial cost. I fear many families will not be able to recover from this blow financially \u2013 in some cases their entire future income has literally been washed away.</p> \n<p>Graziers are battling a race against time to get fodder out to their cattle. With so many facing the logistics of such a task all at once, helicopters, hay and aviation fuel are in short supply and many are completely helpless to do anything until their name reaches the top of the list. Local emergency teams and private helicopter companies have been doing an amazing job with what resources they have. They have gone above and beyond the call of duty.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"c1e24518708c87db6f57982bb687a5dce895bee5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1e24518708c87db6f57982bb687a5dce895bee5/0_0_3543_2365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a man tries to rescue cattle in Queensland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Danny Mara getting ready to sling a live heifer out to dry ground, medication and fodder.

The toll that this will take on our extended agricultural family and our entire local communities, financially and even more so emotionally, really is immeasurable.</p> \n<p>Australia, we need your support.

      "bodyText": "After what can only be described as an environmental massacre of mammoth proportions throughout the whole of north-west Queensland, the people of this country are heartbroken. We live on a family cattle station 60km north of Cloncurry, where we have just received 700mm-plus of rain over seven days, with the majority of that falling over four days. This extreme weather event, equivalent to an inland cyclone, has decimated much of our native wildlife, along with our domestic livestock. They were constantly exposed to wind and cold driving rain for far too long. The majority of the country was either covered in flood water or churned into a bog, making their feed inaccessible. The cattle became weak, using what energy they had struggling through the mud and pushed by the driving rain. After withstanding these harsh conditions for days on end their energy was depleted and they finally became exhausted simply trying to stay warm and died. Graziers around the district are working tirelessly to save what they can and also to humanely euthanise those animals that sadly are beyond saving. My son has been flying over and shooting his beloved cattle for several days, which is absolutely gutting \u2013 he has grown up with them, their parents, their grandparents and great-grandparents. Helicopters are being used to distribute what fodder we have available to the survivors and right now this is our only form of transportation. The majority of the region is still inaccessible to vehicles and will be for some time. The scale of devastation here and throughout the north-west is impossible to put into words. There are estimates of hundreds of thousands of domestic livestock having been lost so far during this disaster and it is impossible to put into numbers the impact on the region\u2019s native wildlife. In some of our paddocks we are facing a 95% loss and on average we are estimating approximately 50% losses over all of our family\u2019s flood-affected properties, encompassing approximately 120,000 acres. Our cattle have been in a significant supplement feeding program, having withstood the last seven years of relative drought. As a result of this our girls were in great condition and we were seeing the beginning of another exceptional crop of calves. Almost overnight we have transitioned from relative drought years to a flood disaster zone. No amount of preparation could have readied our herd for the relentless driving rain and near gale-force winds they had to endure. On day eight the creek by our houses had dropped and slowed just enough for Robert and Kate to swim across and check on some cows close by. The heartbreaking scene they were confronted with on the other side very quickly turned our fears into the horrific nightmare that not only our family but our extended family, the whole of the north-west, are now battling with. It is unfathomable that our ladies in such a short period of time have lost roughly an incredibly 50% of their body weight. The survivors are a mere shadow of the strong healthy animals they were only a fortnight ago. As we begin to access our paddocks we are being confronted with death and devastation at every turn. There are kangaroos dead in trees and fences, birds drowned in drifts of silt and debris and our beloved bovine family lay perished in piles where they have been huddling for protection and warmth. This scene is mirrored across the entire region, it is absolutely soul-destroying to think our animals suffered like this. The scale of destruction this disaster has left in its wake we are only just beginning to discover. The sheer amount of storm water that engulfed the region has demolished fences, exposed pipelines, destroyed water infrastructure, created huge gullies that were once only small seasonal streams, turned roads into rivers and washed dam banks away. Our dam, which was an amazing refuge for birdlife and where I spent many peaceful hours watching them, has been destroyed. Properties further downstream have been inundated by flood water and reports are coming in of entire herds being washed away. Many homestead complexes have been completely submerged. Here we have been lucky \u2013 our houses, sheds and out buildings have remained relatively dry. Others will have lost everything, facing an enormous clean-up on the home front, not just out in the paddock. Right now \u2013 I\u2019m sure I am speaking on behalf of everyone affected \u2013 our focus is entirely on the welfare of our animals. In the coming weeks when the surviving animals no longer require our constant care, our focus will shift to the colossal task of clean-up, repair and rebuilding where possible. This will also be the time where many will start the gruelling task of tallying up the horrific financial cost. I fear many families will not be able to recover from this blow financially \u2013 in some cases their entire future income has literally been washed away. Graziers are battling a race against time to get fodder out to their cattle. With so many facing the logistics of such a task all at once, helicopters, hay and aviation fuel are in short supply and many are completely helpless to do anything until their name reaches the top of the list. Local emergency teams and private helicopter companies have been doing an amazing job with what resources they have. They have gone above and beyond the call of duty. This is an absolutely gut-wrenching time for all of us out here, these cattle are not just our source of income: they are our family and, for many of us, our life\u2019s passion. The toll that this will take on our extended agricultural family and our entire local communities, financially and even more so emotionally, really is immeasurable. Australia, we need your support. Our state and federal governments can do much to help by providing financial funding and disaster assistance packages to help our communities recover and rebuild. The banks can assist by suspending interest repayments on existing mortgages, and writing off significant portions of mortgage debt while our livestock herds rebuild. They own the mortgages on most of this grazing country so they will take a hit with us either way \u2013 they may as well let us make a profit for them again down the track.

It was ignored between its premiere in 1912 and its rediscovery by feminist groups in the 1980s, yet in its passion, power and ability to relate domestic issues to the wider social landscape it more than matches the plays of its time by Harley Granville-Barker and DH Lawrence.</p> <p>Rutherford himself is the patriarchal owner of a Tyneside glassworks who expects total fealty both at home and on the factory floor. His world is slowly crumbling, however. He alienates his two sons, one of whom has made a discovery that could save the tottering firm from collapse, and banishes his daughter, Janet, on learning of her secret affair with his foreman. At the last he is left alone with his daughter-in-law, Mary, who strikes a bargain that shows the balance of power to be radically shifting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"167682a06b79e7cbb32bf77e03a1883bda5dc52f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/167682a06b79e7cbb32bf77e03a1883bda5dc52f/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fealty expected \u2026 Owen Teale in Rutherford and Son.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fealty expected \u2026 Owen Teale in Rutherford and Son.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Other Richard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ingenious as the climax is, I shall remember <a href=\"https://www.casarotto.co.uk/clients/caroline-steinbeis\">Caroline Steinbeis</a>\u2019s production for two tremendous scenes, both involving Laura Elphinstone as Janet. In the first, she rounds on her father, accusing him of ruining her life: delivered by Elphinstone with a lifetime\u2019s banked-up fury, the speech is one of the most potent statements by a wronged woman in British drama. Elphinstone is equally hypnotic when, realising that her lover\u2019s ultimate loyalty is to his master, she sits on a chaise longue with head tilted in silent contemplation of a world awry.</p> <p>Owen Teale is excellent as Rutherford in that he neither rants nor blusters but speaks with the quiet authority of a man who expects to be obeyed. There is strong support from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/sep/21/i-didnt-feel-like-a-minority-until-i-became-an-actor\">Danusia Samal</a> as the despised daughter-in-law, Ciar\u00e1n Owens as her weakly defiant husband and Brian Lonsdale as the foreman steeped in feudal values.

      "bodyText": "The astonishing thing about Githa Sowerby\u2019s play is not that it is currently fashionable \u2013 the National also revives it this year \u2013 but that it lay neglected for so long. It was ignored between its premiere in 1912 and its rediscovery by feminist groups in the 1980s, yet in its passion, power and ability to relate domestic issues to the wider social landscape it more than matches the plays of its time by Harley Granville-Barker and DH Lawrence. Rutherford himself is the patriarchal owner of a Tyneside glassworks who expects total fealty both at home and on the factory floor. His world is slowly crumbling, however. He alienates his two sons, one of whom has made a discovery that could save the tottering firm from collapse, and banishes his daughter, Janet, on learning of her secret affair with his foreman. At the last he is left alone with his daughter-in-law, Mary, who strikes a bargain that shows the balance of power to be radically shifting. Ingenious as the climax is, I shall remember Caroline Steinbeis\u2019s production for two tremendous scenes, both involving Laura Elphinstone as Janet. In the first, she rounds on her father, accusing him of ruining her life: delivered by Elphinstone with a lifetime\u2019s banked-up fury, the speech is one of the most potent statements by a wronged woman in British drama. Elphinstone is equally hypnotic when, realising that her lover\u2019s ultimate loyalty is to his master, she sits on a chaise longue with head tilted in silent contemplation of a world awry. Owen Teale is excellent as Rutherford in that he neither rants nor blusters but speaks with the quiet authority of a man who expects to be obeyed. There is strong support from Danusia Samal as the despised daughter-in-law, Ciar\u00e1n Owens as her weakly defiant husband and Brian Lonsdale as the foreman steeped in feudal values. I could have done without some artily choreographed movement between the acts. Otherwise this is a first-rate revival of a landmark play. At the Crucible, Sheffield, until 23 February",

Horgan and Delaney\u2019s creation gave us the truth. That marriage means long stretches of bonding mostly over problems that your children have created, and hoping that the waters of life leave you enough stepping stones \u2013 as they slowly submerge the love you have for each other \u2013 to get you to the other side and the sweet release of death.</p> <p>Comedically, Delaney and Horgan are made for each other. A show this caustic \u2013 and it burns through comforting delusions as efficiently as acid through meringue \u2013 about long-term love, parenthood and fortysomething bodies needed their individual and joint charisma, warmth and chemistry.

      "bodyText": "After four scabrous series in as many years, covering sex, pregnancy, cervical dysplasia, a child whose name its father can\u2019t pronounce, drunken encounters with stray young penises, bereavement and alcoholism in cruelly, hilariously honest fashion, Catastrophe (Channel 4) last night reached its end. Pulling, the first comedy by Catastrophe\u2019s co-creator Sharon Horgan, is often cited (perhaps because it was so misunderstood, and cruelly cut off in its prime, by the commissioning powers-that-be) as her masterwork. Even its brilliance is but a candle to the blazing beacon that is the story of American ad man Rob Norris (played by Catastrophe\u2019s co-creator Rob Delaney), Irish schoolteacher Sharon and their journey from one-week stand and accidental pregnancy to married parents of two living in domestic bli-\u2026 well, living happily together. Well, living together with enough moments of happiness to make it worthwhile. Probably. I don\u2019t know how singletons found it, but for the spoused-up it was like being battered for half an hour in a rough sea and emerging exhilarated at the end. \u201cSmug marrieds\u201d was always the least believable trope in Bridget Jones (most people wanting to couple up don\u2019t take inspiration from their friends, but rather lessons in what not to settle for). Horgan and Delaney\u2019s creation gave us the truth. That marriage means long stretches of bonding mostly over problems that your children have created, and hoping that the waters of life leave you enough stepping stones \u2013 as they slowly submerge the love you have for each other \u2013 to get you to the other side and the sweet release of death. Comedically, Delaney and Horgan are made for each other. A show this caustic \u2013 and it burns through comforting delusions as efficiently as acid through meringue \u2013 about long-term love, parenthood and fortysomething bodies needed their individual and joint charisma, warmth and chemistry. Without that, Sharon would easily have transmuted from magnificent virago to simple bitch, and Rob the henpecked husband instead of awed, unflinching admirer, happy to let her whet her blade on him but never stupid or soft enough to let her plunge it in. In the final episode, Rob\u2019s mother dies (as Carrie Fisher, who played her, did after the previous series finished filming) just as they arrive for a holiday with his family in the US \u2013 and just like Sharon\u2019s dad did when they went to Ireland to see hers. \u201cPeople die when we visit,\u201d says Rob. \u201cWe have a dark power.\u201d Who should they go and see next, wonders Sharon.

But when they got the first goal ... it was a poor goal to give away ... but then they got the momentum and started to control the game. You can see that we have not played in games at this level for a while, and we will have to learn from the experience. It is not going to be a season-defining one for us, it is one we are going to learn from. Injuries are not a reason, we had quality players to come on. Let\u2019s hope Jesse and Anthony are not too serious, they are muscle injuries so we have to wait a couple of days. Paul is trying to get his body across, and Alves is clever enough to put his foot in there so he hits him. I know he just wanted to shield the ball, but he\u2019s unlucky and it hits him on the knee. Mountains are there to be climbed, aren\u2019t they? You can\u2019t lay down and say this is over. We are going to have to go there and play a good game, believe in ourselves.

After the first goal, they played the way they wanted to play. I couldn\u2019t say we were the better team until that moment, but until then we were not worse than them. They played counter attack, which is what they wanted. It made the difference. We won away against Tottenham, away against Arsenal, big games against big teams, and we will try to win away. We lost some pace, but won some combinations with Alexis and Juan, so I am not sure [the injuries to Martial and Lingard] is the right analysis. Today was tough but now we can not lose our focus. We will try to stay in the top four and try for the FA Cup.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c6341a8e4b00ef6acc6cd01\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T22:06:41.578Z\">10.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A grim-faced Solskjaer trudges off as PSG cavort in front of a bouncing away end. </strong>Their support was magnificent tonight, as impressive as their team.

United gave it a good go in the first half but couldn\u2019t absorb the blow of losing so much pace in Lingard and Martial. United - whose home form in Europe is becoming something of a problem - will have to do something special at the Parc des Princes next month if they\u2019re to turn this around.

(Unless that\u2019s another \u00ae, in which case pick away.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"669778650655c962687e9e44fd09efd599e0edf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/669778650655c962687e9e44fd09efd599e0edf4/0_21_4246_2547/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Attention to detail: 10/10.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Attention to detail: 10/10.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jan Kruger - UEFA/Getty Images for UEFA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>PSG\u2019s pennant isn\u2019t quite as sumptuous.

They\u2019d been paired with Paris St Germain, going great guns while United were misfiring badly. A humbling looked a very real possibility.</p> <p><strong>But a couple of months on, everything has changed. </strong>Ole Gunnar Solsjk\u00e6r has restored United\u2019s self-belief in spectacular style, winning 11 of his first 12 games as interim boss. Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial are purring. PSG meanwhile are in the midst of an injury crisis. Edinson Cavani isn\u2019t expected to shake off a hip problem, Thomas Meunier is concussed, and Neymar is out with a broken metatarsal. And their form suddenly isn\u2019t all that: they\u2019ve recently lost their first league game of the season, to Lyon, and required extra time to get past third-tier Villefranche-Beaujolais in the cup.</p> <p><strong>United will raise a glass to all that; they\u2019re now favourites to seize the initiative in this tie tonight. </strong>Still, they won\u2019t be counting chickens. They\u2019ve only won once at Old Trafford in Europe this season, scraping 1-0 past Young Boys, drawing 0-0 with Valencia and losing 1-0 to Juventus. And they were beaten at home at this stage last year by Sevilla. They\u2019ll be hoping the all-new Ole football brings that sticky run to an end. But PSG have their own worries, having tumbled out at this stage in the last two seasons, thrashed by Real Madrid last year, humiliated by Barcelona\u2019s greatest-ever comeback in 2017. With their squad stretched, plenty rests on young Kylian Mbappe\u2019s shoulders tonight.</p> <p><strong>So here we go, then, the business end of the Champions League. </strong>It\u2019s deliciously poised, with traditional giants hosting one of the tournament favourites. It\u2019s another big European night at Old Trafford. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>8pm GMT.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T16:16:59.816Z\">at 4.16pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "So that\u2019s that, on a miserable night for Manchester United. Their participation in this season\u2019s Champions League is hanging by a thread after PSG turned up the heat during the second half. Our man Daniel Taylor was at Old Trafford to witness it all, and here\u2019s his verdict. Thanks for reading! And now Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who has just tasted defeat for the first time as Manchester United manager. \u201cFirst half, both teams looked at each other, and there really wasn\u2019t too much in it. But when they got the first goal ... it was a poor goal to give away ... but then they got the momentum and started to control the game. You can see that we have not played in games at this level for a while, and we will have to learn from the experience. It is not going to be a season-defining one for us, it is one we are going to learn from. Injuries are not a reason, we had quality players to come on. Let\u2019s hope Jesse and Anthony are not too serious, they are muscle injuries so we have to wait a couple of days. Paul is trying to get his body across, and Alves is clever enough to put his foot in there so he hits him. I know he just wanted to shield the ball, but he\u2019s unlucky and it hits him on the knee. Mountains are there to be climbed, aren\u2019t they? You can\u2019t lay down and say this is over. We are going to have to go there and play a good game, believe in ourselves. But today was a reality check.\u201d A word with Ander Herrera. \u201cI think the game was tight until the corner. After the first goal, they played the way they wanted to play. I couldn\u2019t say we were the better team until that moment, but until then we were not worse than them. They played counter attack, which is what they wanted. It made the difference. We won away against Tottenham, away against Arsenal, big games against big teams, and we will try to win away. We lost some pace, but won some combinations with Alexis and Juan, so I am not sure [the injuries to Martial and Lingard] is the right analysis. Today was tough but now we can not lose our focus. We will try to stay in the top four and try for the FA Cup.\u201d A grim-faced Solskjaer trudges off as PSG cavort in front of a bouncing away end. Their support was magnificent tonight, as impressive as their team. Some perspective will surely be in order. PSG were third favourites to win the Champions League this morning, and bossed this match accordingly. United gave it a good go in the first half but couldn\u2019t absorb the blow of losing so much pace in Lingard and Martial. United - whose home form in Europe is becoming something of a problem - will have to do something special at the Parc des Princes next month if they\u2019re to turn this around. But never say never: they\u2019ve already won a big away game this season, at Juventus, while Solskjaer has been known to inspire the odd European comeback in the past. A dreadful night for United comes to a close. They\u2019ve lost Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard to injury, while Paul Pogba stupidly got himself sent off and will miss the second leg in three weeks time. PSG have two away goals in their pocket, and one foot in the second round. United have it all to do. It\u2019ll be fascinating to see how Ole Gunnar Solskjaer responds to the first serious setback of his interim reign. 90 min +3: It\u2019s a game of keepball now for PSG, and their fans are enjoying it very much. It\u2019s ole football; just not the Ole football the home faithful were hoping to witness. 90 min +1: Now it\u2019s Shaw\u2019s turn to go into the book, for clanking into the back of Dani Alves. There have been ten yellow cards this evening, with six shown to United players, two of them to Pogba alone. He\u2019ll be a huge miss in Paris for the second leg. 90 min: There will be four added minutes. 89 min: Yes, it\u2019s a second yellow. For a while, it looked as though the United captain Young has talked himself into trouble, and been shown a second card. But after some confusion, it\u2019s Pogba that\u2019s been sent packing, and he can have no complaints. That wasn\u2019t a good tackle on Dani Alves at all. He departs down the tunnel, a frustrated figure. 88 min: Dani Alves blooters a witless free kick straight into the United wall. That allows Pogba to have a wander down the left. Upon losing control, he crumps his studs into Dani Alves\u2019s leg. That\u2019s a poor challenge. A second yellow coming up? 87 min: Mbappe spins and turns on the jets. As he approaches the United box he\u2019s nicked to the floor by Herrera, who becomes the latest player to go in the referee\u2019s very thick notebook. 86 min: Shaw and Mata work their way down the left. The ball\u2019s dinked forward in the hope of sending Sanchez scuttling off into space, but the flag goes up for offside. The home fans are getting a little frustrated with Sanchez, a smattering of groans here and there. 84 min: United have got PSG pinned back in their box. But they can\u2019t fashion space for a shot, or find the killer through-ball. Herrera tries to wedge Rashford clear, but the ball harmlessly bounces out for a goal kick. And then Rashford is replaced by Lukaku, United\u2019s final throw of the dice tonight. 82 min: Herrera has been his usual relentless self. He makes a little space to the left of the D, and looks to snap a curler into the top right. It\u2019s wide and high, but not so far away. A decent effort out of very little. 81 min: Di Maria, who has two assists to his name tonight, despite getting the bird all evening, is replaced by right-back Champions League debutant Colin Dagba. Di Maria takes his sweet time to depart, and ostentatiously claps the away support before he sits down. 80 min: United enjoy their best period of possession of the night. But they go nowhere, with PSG happy to sit back in their final third and keep their shape. 78 min: United knock the ball this way and that. Then Herrera slips Young free with a cute pass down the right. Young whips a low ball down the corridor of uncertainty ... but nobody in red has taken a chance, and four white-shirted defenders can usher the ball away from danger. A sorry end to a nice passage of play from United. 76 min: A ball-on-string dribble by Mata down the inside-right channel. He flicks a pass wide to Young, but the resulting cross is easily cleared by Thiago Silva. United come again, but Mata\u2019s shot from distance is a poor effort. 75 min: Verratti is down getting treatment, having turned his left ankle. The physio applies some magic spray, but it doesn\u2019t work, and he\u2019s limping off in some pain. Paredes, the \u00a347m signing from Zenit, comes on in his stead. 73 min: Rashford looks the best bet if United are to get something out of this. Young sprays a lovely ball down the right, the lively striker nearly getting clear. But Bernat does just enough to close him down. 71 min: But that\u2019s allowed United to up the pressure for the first time in this second half. Herrera has a whack from distance and the ball pinballs out for a corner. However Shaw\u2019s delivery is appalling and the visitors are able to clear. 69 min: A lull, which will suit PSG down to the ground. Matic tries to get something going from a deep position on the left, sending a glorious crossfield ball towards Rashford. But the striker can\u2019t control, and it\u2019s a throw to PSG deep in their own territory. 67 min: Herrera, out on the right, crosses long for Shaw, who brings it down and shoots from the left-hand corner of the box. Dani Alves charges it down; danger over. 65 min: Now Draxler sends Bernat into acres down the left. His rising screamer is tipped over the bar by de Gea, who has just single-handedly kept his team in this. The resulting corner comes to nothing. United need to clear their heads, and quick. 63 min: United are in serious danger of losing this round-of-16 tonight. They\u2019ve overcommitted, and when Herrera\u2019s cross is intercepted, Mbappe is sent screaming down the right. He\u2019s clear into the box, draws de Gea, and looks to dink over the keeper and into the net. De Gea sticks up an arm, while starjumping in the Schmeichel style, and that\u2019s a crucial - and brilliant - save. 62 min: Dani Alves comes through the back of Pogba, who springs up in a furious mood. The referee flashes yellow; the resulting free kick is easily cleared by the visitors. PSG glide up the other end, and take control of this tie. Kehrer slips Di Maria away down the left. Di Maria\u2019s low cross is perfection, allowing Mbappe to open his body up and meet it with a dainty sidefoot six yards out, flicking the ball past de Gea and into the bottom right. That was such a clinical break; what a cross and finish. 59 min: But this is better from United. Mata swings one in from the right. It\u2019s only half cleared and drops to Herrera, whose first-time smash goalwards bounces through a crowded box and millimetres wide of the bottom left! Buffon looked as though he knew that was going wide, but dear me he was taking some risk there. That was ludicrously close to the goal United desperately need. 58 min: United are struggling to put anything together in attack. They\u2019ve been second to pretty much everything since the restart. 56 min: Draxler\u2019s corner is half-cleared by Rashford. The ball drops to Dani Alves on the edge of the box. The resulting volley comes off the ankle of Pogba, and nearly flies into the left-hand side of the net past a wrong-footed de Gea. Fortunately for United, the ball flies inches wide of the left-hand post, and the second corner leads to absolutely nowt. But that was so close to a terribly unlucky break for the hosts, who are rocking a bit here. 55 min: PSG have been in control of this match since the restart. Marquinhos sends Di Maria away down the left; he wins a corner off Young. Di Maria prepares to take, and someone eejit launches a bottle towards him. Draxler will take instead. Di Maria takes from the right, looping the ball to the far post. United are standing as statues, and Kimpembe races in to sidefoot a volley past de Gea from close range! That\u2019s as easy a goal as you\u2019ll see; United were collectively asleep there. And now the French champions have a precious away goal. 53 min: Draxler finds Dani Alves again on the right, and this time his cross is decent. Mbappe escapes the attention of Lindelof and Bailly and heads towards the bottom right from ten yards. De Gea does very well to turn the ball round the post for a corner. From which ... 52 min: Di Maria drives at the United back line, then lays off to Draxler, who then feeds Dani Alves on the right. The resulting cross is a waste of time. But PSG get the ball back and hog it awhile. 50 min: Lindelof is the latest player to go in the book, for a tug on Mbappe. That\u2019s three apiece now. 49 min: Young pearls a pass down the right for Rashford, who makes off into space before being stopped by Thiago Silva. Rashford one-twos with Mata, then whips a cross through the box to nobody. 47 min: Lindelof barges into the back of Mbappe. No foul. Then Rashford appears to be hauled back by the already-booked Kimpembe. No foul for that one either! This referee was card happy in the first half; it appears he\u2019s taking a more laissez-faire approach for the second. And we\u2019re off again! Manchester United get the second half underway. They\u2019ll be kicking towards the Stretford End, having made their second enforced change of the evening during the break: Martial isn\u2019t able to continue either, and he\u2019s replaced by Mata. Half-time entertainment. And that\u2019s it for the first half. Not much in the way of penalty-box action, but that was rollicking good end-to-end fun nonetheless. Stay tuned for another tense 45! \u201cUnited should take Sanchez off at half time,\u201d opines Mark Coward. \u201cHe\u2019s done absolutely nothing in the first half.\u201d 45 min +4: It looks as though Lingard can\u2019t continue. He\u2019s down holding his left hamstring. Sanchez had prepared to come on for Martial a few minutes ago, but now he\u2019s taking Lingard\u2019s place instead. 45 min +2: Dani Alves scoops a harmless free kick over the bar, de Gea behind it all the way. 45 min: United easily clear the corner and stream upfield. Verratti crunches into Martial, who looks revived, to put a stop to the break. PSG counter the counter, and Matic brings down Draxler just to the left of the D; a free kick. In between times, Lingard goes over and requires some treatment. There follows a couple of minutes of downtime, before we get round to the free kick. The two minutes of added time will effectively start now, announces the ref. 44 min: Di Maria and Bernat combine well down the left, turning Bailly and Young this way and that. Lingard is forced to track back and concede a corner. 42 min: Young wins a corner down the right. It comes to nothing. Di Maria comes back on the field of play to a chorus of boos. This has been high-octane fun, if not particularly full of quality play. 40 min: It all kicks off as Mbappe slips a pass out to the left for Di Maria to chase. It\u2019s not a good pass, and Di Maria\u2019s never getting to it before it goes out of play. But Di Maria and Young are going at full pent. Young needlessly shoulder barges Di Maria off the pitch and into the wall surrounding the pitch. Ooyah, oof. Everyone gets involved in a heated discussion, but the referee does nothing. Young is perhaps fortunate to escape a second yellow - that\u2019s certainly what the PSG players wanted to see - while Di Maria remains off the pitch having his arm looked at, the result of that awkward fall. 39 min: Martial is down feeling his hamstring. Not sure whether he\u2019ll be able to continue. Sanchez, warming up on the touchline, is summoned back to the bench. 37 min: A lull. Then suddenly PSG spring to life! Verratti slips a ball down the middle to split United\u2019s defence in two. Mbappe and Di Maria are both clear! Mbappe defers to Di Maria, which isn\u2019t the right decision as he\u2019s offside, whereas the striker isn\u2019t. Di Maria tries to round de Gea on the outside, and manages it, but then fails to sidefoot into the open net, inexplicably allowing de Gea to gather. The home crowd enjoy his failure very much indeed. Di Maria is very pleased to see the flag go up, so his miss didn\u2019t matter, but PSG made a right balls of that. 34 min: Yes, there\u2019s a good chance this won\u2019t end with 22 men on the field. Now it\u2019s Bernat who goes into the referee\u2019s notebook, punishment for running with great feeling into Young as the two challenge for a 50-50 down the United right. Five bookings already! 32 min: Pogba slides across the wet turf and nearly clatters into Thiago Silva. Then seconds later, Shaw clatters into Kimpembe as he tries to round him out on the left. The ref sees neither challenge as a foul, which is probably correct and also just as well, seeing both Pogba and Kimpembe have already been booked. They need to wind it back in a bit. 31 min: Di Maria curls it into the mixer. Lindelof heads clear. But the Parisian fans continue to make the most of the noise, as their team begin to take a semblance of control (though there\u2019s not much in it). 30 min: Mbappe chases after a long pass down the left, and is hauled back unceremoniously by Young. That\u2019s a clear booking and a free kick for PSG out by the touchline. They load the box in preparation. 28 min: Mbappe had been quiet, but suddenly he\u2019s come to life. Verratti, quarterbacking from deep, slips a pass down the inside-right channel that\u2019s immediately helped on by Draxler. Suddenly Mbappe is free in the area! But he\u2019s never in control and hoicks a shot wide right while falling back, de Gea having got right up in his grille. A suggestion Mbappe might have been an inch or so offside; it\u2019d have been a poser for the dude in the VAR truck had it gone in. 27 min: Mbappe turns on the jets and nearly gets past Lindelof. The United defender just about kept on his tail, doing enough to force Mbappe into a heavy touch that puts a stop to his gallop. But for a second there, United look exposed by Mbappe\u2019s pace. 25 min: More nerves, as Verratti dribbles back towards his own area and is nearly stripped by Rashford. The ref blows for a free kick, getting Verratti off the hook. Then the same player is kicked from behind by Pogba, and you know what this referee thinks of that. Yellow card. A fair chance already that this won\u2019t end 11 versus 11, not that it\u2019s a particularly dirty game. 24 min: Lingard one-twos with Rashford down the right and suddenly he\u2019s racing into a PSG half that contains only one defender! He\u2019s got Martial on the other wing, but just as the crowd get excited, he plays a dreadful pass behind Martial and out of play on the left. Both sides are looking a little shaky right now. 22 min: Pogba sticks his glove over the mouth of Marquinhos as the pair tussle in midfield. It\u2019s a free kick, and the United midfielder is a wee bit lucky that the ref doesn\u2019t flash a card in his grid. He was probably helped by Marquinhos going down in theatrical style. 21 min: The 4,000 PSG fans are giving it plenty. Their heroes ping it around awhile, their first period of sustained possession. Verratti then tries to release Mbappe down the inside-left channel, but the pass is way too strong and flies out for a goal kick. On the touchline, Thomas Tuchel throws semaphore shapes in a grand fit of anger with his own players. 19 min: Now Draxler is booked for a clip on the heels of Herrera. It wasn\u2019t the worst challenge you\u2019ll ever see, but this ref is taking no nonsense. 18 min: Young continues to be a nuisance out on the right. He sends in a lovely cross that nearly finds Lingard, but the ball is eyebrowed away from the United striker, six yards out, by Kimpembe. That\u2019s such a crucial clearance. The ball goes out for a throw on the left; from that, Pogba blazes wildly over from distance. 16 min: Pogba swans past Kimpembe out on the United right and reaches the byline. He fires a low ball towards Lingard at the near post. Buffon does extremely well to get down and snaffle under extreme pressure. Thiago Silva goes over in a tussle with Lingard and isn\u2019t particularly happy about it, but the ref simply tells him to get on with it. 15 min: It\u2019s gone a little scrappy. Young charges down Kimpembe, who makes a meal of clearing from the left-back position. But the ball breaks through to Buffon. 13 min: A couple of slinky runs down the middle of the park by Marquinhos and Verratti. It\u2019s a long time before they\u2019re challenged by Matic, something United will need to address sooner rather than later. PSG look confident whenever they make their way forward. 11 min: Rashford\u2019s quick feet in the centre of the park forces Kimpembe into dragging him back. That\u2019s the first booking of the tie, and one of PSG\u2019s central defenders treading on eggshells already. 10 min: PSG pass it around the back awhile. Then Buffon blooters a simple pass towards Bernat into the stand out to his left. Many ironic cheers greet this. 8 min: Good work by Young out on the right as he combines with Lingard to earn a little space. He then feeds Rashford down the wing; his shot-cum-cross nicks off Bernat and is heading for the top right. Buffon turns the ball round the post for a corner, which leads to nothing. Meanwhile here\u2019s Justin Kavanagh: \u201cI read this morning how those rumours about Gordon Banks\u2019 food being poisoned in 1970 were never quite dispelled. And then there was the infamous water-spiking incident at Italia 90 when Branco was gotten at by Argentina. Do you think in the future VAR will be hacked to send false directives to referees during matches? Or will hackers alter the video so handballs look more obvious in the area? Or will they just dope the cups of tea being sent into the transit van? How will football villains break the rules in the digital age? I imagine Mourinho is working on this as we speak.\u201d 6 min: The first serious effort on goal of the evening, and it\u2019s by Di Maria, who looks to curl one into the top right from 25 yards out on the left. It\u2019s always bending wide, but it\u2019s not certain that de Gea would have got his fingertips to it had it been bending the other way and into the top corner. 5 min: Rashford is surrounded in the centre circle and suddenly there are four white shirts running at the United back line. But a loose pass allows United to counter, Rashford trying to free Lingard into the area from the right. Not quite. But this is a lovely open, exciting, end-to-end start to the match. 3 min: Angel Di Maria, erstwhile United record signing, goes on a wander down the left. The roof nearly comes off as he\u2019s given the bird by his old fans. He didn\u2019t have a great time at Old Trafford, did he. 2 min: Bernat dribbles down the left but is easily robbed by Matic, who sets Lingard away on a run into PSG territory. Lingard is barged in the back by Marquinhos, who is fortunate to escape a booking for his cynicism. The resulting free kick comes to nothing. And we\u2019re off! Amid proper bedlam, PSG get the party started. And they\u2019re quickly pressed back, United coming quick and hard out of the blocks, Lingard and Young nearly stripping Kimpembe of possession near the right-hand corner flag. They press a bit too hard, and a free kick releases the pressure, but what an early statement of intent by United! RIP Emiliano and Gordon. Before we kick off, there\u2019s a minute\u2019s applause for the tragic Emiliano Sala, and England\u2019s 1966 World Cup winning goalkeeper Gordon Banks, who passed away today. The teams are out! Manchester United wear their famous red shirts with black trim, while PSG sport second-choice white. There\u2019s a proper European atmosphere at Old Trafford, as you\u2019d expect when two of the biggest clubs in Europe prepare to get it on for a place in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. It doesn\u2019t look as though Thiago Silva has dragged the tassels of his pennant through that gunk, while in other gift-related news, our picture editor has confirmed that it is indeed another arguably unnecessary \u00ae stitched underneath Uefa\u2019s logo on the United flag. So apologies for casting any aspersions on the quality of the embroidery. Anyway, we\u2019ll be off in a minute! Ole Gunnar Solskjaer - relaxed, smiling, impressive and thoroughly likeable as always - speaks to BT Sport. \u201cI don\u2019t think we could have been in a better frame of mind going into this game, or in better form. So we are looking forward to it. Let\u2019s hope we can have a good start, that\u2019s going to be important. We have prepared without Neymar, Cavani and Meunier, but I think the crowd would have loved to see those players and as players you\u2019d rather play against the best ones, we\u2019d have enjoyed their best team being out there. Bailly and Lindelof have done well together, and against Mbappe they will have to be at the top of their game. We need to be clinical. It\u2019s important for us to get to Paris with the chance to go through.\u201d VAR will be used for the first time in the Champions League tonight. The whole kit and caboodle is set up in the back of a Transit van in the Old Trafford car park, which will send a cold shiver down the spine of anyone who sat through ITV early-evening light-entertainment show The Premiership back in the day. Uefa refereeing bigwig Hugh Dallas is interviewed in the truck by BT Sport, brandishing a leaflet which explains using words and pretty pictures that the VAR team will \u201cconstantly check for clear and obvious errors related to the following four match-changing situations: goals, incidents in the penalty area, red cards, and mistaken identity.\u201d So there you have it. Incidentally, the feed cut out and the screen went to black exactly 16.3 seconds into the interview. Hopefully that\u2019s not a harbinger of things to come. Pennant watch. So what will Ashley Young and Thiago Silva be swapping when they shake hands before kick off? Manchester United\u2019s commemorative flag is painstakingly embroidered, right down to a \u00ae next to the crest, surely an unnecessary legal safeguard on what is essentially a bespoke gift to another football club. A quality item, though don\u2019t be pulling at that loose thread at the bottom of the Champions League logo, or the whole thing might unravel. (Unless that\u2019s another \u00ae, in which case pick away.) PSG\u2019s pennant isn\u2019t quite as sumptuous. A crisper, clearer design perhaps, but without the grandeur of United\u2019s effort. Let\u2019s hope the tassels don\u2019t get dragged through that sticky patch to the right. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer makes five changes to the Manchester United team named at Fulham on Saturday. In come Ashley Young, Eric Bailly, Victor Lindelof, Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford; they replace Diogo Dalot, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Juan Mata and Romelu Lukaku. Thomas Tuchel makes six changes to the PSG XI selected for the scrap against Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at the weekend. Edinson Cavani and Thomas Meunier picked up injuries; they\u2019re replaced by Thilo Kehrer and Kylian Mbappe. Meanwhile Stanley N\u2019Soki, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, Christopher Nkunku and Moussa Diaby make way for Marquinhos, Angel Di Maria, Juan Bernat and Julian Draxler. Manchester United: de Gea, Young, Bailly, Lindelof, Shaw, Herrera, Matic, Pogba, Lingard, Martial, Rashford. Subs: Romero, Jones, Sanchez, Mata, Lukaku, Fred, Dalot. Paris Saint-Germain: Buffon, Kehrer, Thiago Silva, Kimpembe, Bernat, Verratti, Marquinhos, Dani Alves, Draxler, Di Maria, Mbappe. Subs: Areola, Paredes, Choupo-Moting, Kurzawa, Nkunku, Diaby, Dagba. Referee: Daniele Orsato (Italy). The world was a different place back on December 17. Jose Mourinho was still manager of Manchester United, for another 24 hours anyway, and when the draw for the Champions League Round of 16 was made, it looked all over for the three-time winners. They\u2019d been paired with Paris St Germain, going great guns while United were misfiring badly. A humbling looked a very real possibility. But a couple of months on, everything has changed. Ole Gunnar Solsjk\u00e6r has restored United\u2019s self-belief in spectacular style, winning 11 of his first 12 games as interim boss. Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial are purring. PSG meanwhile are in the midst of an injury crisis. Edinson Cavani isn\u2019t expected to shake off a hip problem, Thomas Meunier is concussed, and Neymar is out with a broken metatarsal. And their form suddenly isn\u2019t all that: they\u2019ve recently lost their first league game of the season, to Lyon, and required extra time to get past third-tier Villefranche-Beaujolais in the cup. United will raise a glass to all that; they\u2019re now favourites to seize the initiative in this tie tonight. Still, they won\u2019t be counting chickens. They\u2019ve only won once at Old Trafford in Europe this season, scraping 1-0 past Young Boys, drawing 0-0 with Valencia and losing 1-0 to Juventus. And they were beaten at home at this stage last year by Sevilla. They\u2019ll be hoping the all-new Ole football brings that sticky run to an end. But PSG have their own worries, having tumbled out at this stage in the last two seasons, thrashed by Real Madrid last year, humiliated by Barcelona\u2019s greatest-ever comeback in 2017. With their squad stretched, plenty rests on young Kylian Mbappe\u2019s shoulders tonight. So here we go, then, the business end of the Champions League. It\u2019s deliciously poised, with traditional giants hosting one of the tournament favourites. It\u2019s another big European night at Old Trafford. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 8pm GMT.",

      "bodyText": "Business leaders have demanded the prime minister answer 20 crucial questions before the 29 March deadline to prevent a chaotic no-deal Brexit. The British Chamber of Commerce (BCC), the UK business trade body, said that without greater clarity over import and export duties, border controls and customs procedures, Theresa May risked thousands of companies suffering a potentially catastrophic shock when the UK quits the European Union. Adam Marshall, the BCC\u2019s director general, said British firms could face the biggest change to their terms of trade in over a generation in less than 50 days, \u201cwithout the information and clarity they need to navigate their forward course\u201d. The warning came only a fortnight after the BCC said thousands of firms were planning to relocate inside the remaining 27 EU nations to avoid potential hiccups at the border and maintain consistent relationships with customers and suppliers. Referring to the number of businesses that have publicly triggered plans to move abroad as \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d, the organisation said no deal has gone from being \u201cone of several possible scenarios to a firm date in the diary\u201d for its 75,000 members. A poll by the Institute of Directors (IoD) at the end of last month found that nearly one in three British businesses are planning to relocate some of their operations abroad or have already shifted them to cope with a hard Brexit. Marshall said the risks were mounting every day for businesses as they headed toward the 29 March deadline. \u201cThere is a very real risk that a lack of clear, actionable information from government will leave firms, their people and their communities hung out to dry,\u201d he said. \u201cEven those companies trying their hardest to get ready are still in the dark on important matters from contracts through to customs. Many others, who took the decision to wait for the political process to conclude before acting, would face sudden and costly adjustments if a deal is not reached.\u201d Tens of thousands of small firms were also struggling to cope with the uncertainty, said Mike Cherry, the head of the Federation of Small Businesses.

The UK Sport chief executive, Liz Nicholl, said it was still unclear how much funding the government would give for the Paris 2024 cycle but added: \u201cWe are confident government will continue to recognise the importance of elite sport and it will continue to support this world-leading system.\u201d She also defended the medal-focused policy, saying: \u201cNo compromise was a term we used at the outset of allocating funding \u2013 it is about a no compromise focus on excellence and the right support being given the right athletes. It has never been about winning at all costs. It has been about excellence.\u201d",

That deprived United of the speed Solskj\u00e6r wants in wide attacking areas, although the truth is the two injured players had found it difficult to make any positive impact during their time on the pitch.</p> <p>The most revealing statistic at half-time, with only five efforts at goal, was that no other game in this season\u2019s Champions League had witnessed fewer first-half shots. Solskj\u00e6r must have dearly wanted an improvement but it was PSG who suddenly clicked and for the rest of the game the Ligue 1 leaders played as though affronted by the suggestion that the absence of Neymar and Edinson Cavani had to be a debilitating setback.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7dfc573bb959982b9e62cd7ce4678feb910d7fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7dfc573bb959982b9e62cd7ce4678feb910d7fa/205_373_2983_1789/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Presnel Kimpembe puts PSG 1-0 ahead at Manchester United\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Presnel Kimpembe puts PSG 1-0 ahead at Manchester United.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps they had a bit of good fortune, too, because a reasonable argument could be made that Kimpembe should not have been on the pitch for the opening goal, having been booked for one foul on Martial and putting in a couple of risky challenges on Lingard and Rashford that might have warranted a second yellow card.</p> <p>In the 53rd minute, David de Gea turned Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s downward header round a post for a corner. Di Mar\u00eda whipped the ball into the penalty area and Nemanja Matic, the nearest player to Kimpembe, seemed to think De Gea would come off his line to collect it.

This time the attack had originated with Marquinhos dispossessing Pogba in the other half of the pitch. Di Mar\u00eda\u2019s delivery from the left was weighted perfectly and Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s acceleration did the rest, coupled with his utter determination to make sure he reached the ball ahead of Bailly and Lindel\u00f6f, then clipping a shot past De Gea without breaking stride.</p> <p>For Solskj\u00e6r the most alarming part was United\u2019s lack of creativity. This was the first time, perhaps surprisingly, Buffon has ever faced United at Old Trafford and the only troubling moment for the goalkeeper was an early kick that he misdirected out of play. Pogba, already booked from the first half, had been irritated by a foul from Dani Alves and the next time the ball came between the two players he went in studs-high. It was a challenge laced with frustration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The referee, Daniele Orsato, reached for his yellow card on 10 separate occasions.

The most revealing statistic at half-time, with only five efforts at goal, was that no other game in this season\u2019s Champions League had witnessed fewer first-half shots. Solskj\u00e6r must have dearly wanted an improvement but it was PSG who suddenly clicked and for the rest of the game the Ligue 1 leaders played as though affronted by the suggestion that the absence of Neymar and Edinson Cavani had to be a debilitating setback. Perhaps they had a bit of good fortune, too, because a reasonable argument could be made that Kimpembe should not have been on the pitch for the opening goal, having been booked for one foul on Martial and putting in a couple of risky challenges on Lingard and Rashford that might have warranted a second yellow card. In the 53rd minute, David de Gea turned Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s downward header round a post for a corner. Di Mar\u00eda whipped the ball into the penalty area and Nemanja Matic, the nearest player to Kimpembe, seemed to think De Gea would come off his line to collect it. He didn\u2019t \u2013 and Kimpembe\u2019s volley flew into the roof of the net. After that PSG went for the kill and on the hour-mark the ball went forward through Juan Bernat and Di Mar\u00eda again. This time the attack had originated with Marquinhos dispossessing Pogba in the other half of the pitch. Di Mar\u00eda\u2019s delivery from the left was weighted perfectly and Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s acceleration did the rest, coupled with his utter determination to make sure he reached the ball ahead of Bailly and Lindel\u00f6f, then clipping a shot past De Gea without breaking stride. For Solskj\u00e6r the most alarming part was United\u2019s lack of creativity. This was the first time, perhaps surprisingly, Buffon has ever faced United at Old Trafford and the only troubling moment for the goalkeeper was an early kick that he misdirected out of play. Pogba, already booked from the first half, had been irritated by a foul from Dani Alves and the next time the ball came between the two players he went in studs-high. It was a challenge laced with frustration. The referee, Daniele Orsato, reached for his yellow card on 10 separate occasions. Pogba\u2019s were number three and nine and he will not be playing in Paris when, barring an incredible comeback, United\u2019s participation in the Champions League will draw to a close.",

Shocks are rare in this competition and unpredictability is limited. If you don\u2019t have hundreds of millions to chuck around every summer, you can probably forget about winning it. If you don\u2019t have elite players, history suggests there\u2019s only so far you can go.</p> <p>But it is a knockout competition, so you never know, and both of these sides will reckon they have a fine chance of making the quarter-finals. Having finished second in their group, Roma must be pretty relieved not to have landed one of your Barcelonas or your Bayern Munichs or your PSGS. Having finished top of theirs, Porto must be pretty pleased to have avoided your Liverpools, your Atletico Madrids, your Manchester Uniteds. It\u2019s all to play for at the Stadio Olimpico this evening!</p> <p>And it\u2019s also very hard to call. Trying to pick a favourite isn\u2019t easy. Porto, top of the Portuguese league by a point and unbeaten since October, will be happy to have the second leg at home and Sergio Concecaio will feel confident that he has enough experience and firepower at his disposal to reach the last eight. But while Roma are having a sticky season domestically - Eusebio Di Francesco\u2019s side are sixth in Serie A after an inconsistent run of results and lost 7-1 to Fiorentina in the Coppa Italia last month \u2013 the Italians knocked out Barcelona on their way to reaching the last four last season and should represent a step up in class for Porto, who topped a group containing Galatasaray, Lokomotiv Moscow and Schalke. In conclusion: anything could happen. Which is just how it should be. </p> <p><strong>Kick-off: </strong>8pm GMT, 9pm in Rome. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T17:40:18.553Z\">at 5.40pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Roma hold on in the end and will take a 2-1 lead to Portugal for the second leg. But the evening\u2019s ended on a note of slight disappointment for the Italians given that they led 2-0 thanks to a double from Nicolo Zaniolo. Adrian Lopez\u2019s away goal means Porto will fancy their chances on 6 March. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye. It\u2019s all over! 90 min+: A Roma counter ends with Casillas pushing Kolarov\u2019s powerful shot away. 90 min+3: The camera picks out Francesco Totti in the stands. The Roma legend looks a little nervous. 90 min+1: There will be five added minutes. 90 min: Justin Kluivert replaces Stefan El Shaarawy for Roma. 88 min: El Shaarawy picks up a booking for a clumsy foul on Militao. 87 min: Davide Santon replaces Nicolo Zaniolo, Roma\u2019s two-goal hero. 84 min: Porto make their final change, Otavio replaced by Hernani. 83 min: Steven Nzonzi replaces Lorenzo Pellegrini for Roma. Moments later Herrera bends a brilliant shot inches wide from 25 yards. Roma are rocking. Mirante was beaten. A long ball forward isn\u2019t dealt with by Fazio and Manolas on the edge of the area. It\u2019s knocked back over the top by Tiquinho, the flag stays down and Adrian Lopez deals with a dropping ball excellently, jabbing past Mirante with his right foot! Porto are back in it! A VAR check confirms the striker was onside. Porto silence the Stadio Olimpico with what could prove to be a crucial away goal! Just as Porto make an attacking change, Roma strike again! It\u2019s Dzeko at the heart of it again, driving through the middle and advancing towards the area before letting fly from 25 yards. The ball skims past Casillas and pings off the right post, but Porto get no luck. The rebound falls to Zaniolo, who easily puts the ball into the empty net. The youngster does it again! 76 min: Andre Pereira replaces Fernando. 74 min: Herrera\u2019s booked for catching De Rossi with a lunging challenge. 72 min: Porto almost hit back immediately, only for Adrian Lopez to sidefoot against a Roma defender from close range! This is a lovely goal! The ball\u2019s knocked into the middle by El Shaarawy. Dzeko collects with his back to goal, ignores a shove from Pepe (of course) and shuffles a pass right to Zaniolo, who takes a touch before drilling a low shot past Casillas and into the far corner! What nerve from the 19-year-old. The youngster gives Roma the lead out of the nothing! 68 min: Brahimi\u2019s been replaced by Adrian Lopez. He seemed to twist an ankle after a foul by De Rossi, who was out for revenge after being embarrassed by a tremendous piece of skill by Brahimi earlier in the half. 67 min: Brahimi has gone down again. Conceicao\u2019s furious Roma continue to attack for a while. Tempers flare again. Everyone calms down after a while. 66 min: Cristante wriggles free on the right and manages to pull the ball back to Pellegrini, who wallops straight at Casillas. 65 min: Brahimi is hobbling and struggling. His night might be over. 62 min: Pellegrini tests Casillas with a firm drive from 25 yards. Casillas deals with it. 60 min: Roma\u2019s fizz has faded again. 57 min: Porto win a corner on the left, the wily Brahimi winning it. Telles sends in an outswinger and Danilo glances just wide at the near post. That\u2019s the closest Porto have come. 55 min: El Shaarawy blasts miles over from 25 yards. This is not good from Roma. 51 min: Roma are trying to press high and play with more energy. Let\u2019s see how long it lasts. 48 min: Roma\u2019s best hope might be forcing an error from Casillas through the simple tactic of putting a cross into the box. A bit of flapping from the Porto goalkeeper almost leads to a calamity, but Cristante can\u2019t take advantage. 46 min: Porto get the second half underway. Let\u2019s be charitable and call it a tight game. 45 min: Pellegrini stays down after a collision with Tiquinho. Play stops so he can receives some treatment. He\u2019s fine. 42 min: El Shaarawy almost breaks through on the left. But he doesn\u2019t. 37 min: Fazio picks out Dzeko with a wonderful pass from deep. The striker takes the ball down brilliantly, cuts past Militao, moves inside the area and looks certain to score as he draws back his right foot. But with only Casillas to beat, he slams a powerful shot against the right post and the ball bounces away to safety! It was wonderful play until the finish. 35 min: Pellegrini sends in another set-piece, a corner this time, but Dzeko heads over. 34 min: A free-kick to Roma on the right. Pellegrini whips it in and Manolas, who scored the winner against Barcelona last season, can\u2019t quite rise high enough in the middle. The defender was unmarked. 32 min: Roma haven\u2019t had a decent attack since the first 10 minutes. They look very one-dimensional. 30 min: Otavio wriggles into the box from the right and finds Fernando, who turns and shoots straight at Mirante. 29 min: A minor disagreement in the middle after Fernando objects to El Shaarawy having a nibble at his heels. 27 min: Kolarov crosses from the left. Casillas claws it away unconvincingly. Moments later Cristante sweeps a shot straight at Casillas from 18 yards. 25 min: Porto are starting to dominate possession. Roma seem to be short on ideas, though there\u2019s every chance Dzeko could come up with something. 22 min: Porto will be pleased with how they\u2019ve started. Apart from a couple of iffy moments at the back they\u2019ve mostly kept Roma at arm\u2019s length and have looked strong in midfield. It wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see them snatch a goal either. 20 min: A shot would be nice. 17 min: Porto attack down the left and lift the ball into the Roma area. The defending isn\u2019t great. A poor clearance lands at the feet of Otavio on the edge of the area, but he isn\u2019t assertive enough and the chance disappears. 14 min: Porto have set up in a cautious way. You sense Roma might get frustrated here. 11 min: Porto make a hash of the free-kick. Roma counter immediately. Dzeko runs down the left and curls a cross into the middle. Casillas dives out again, but Brahimi doesn\u2019t get the shout and steps in to clear. For a moment I thought it was going to be an own goal, but Brahimi gets away with it. 10 min: Fernando rumbles down the left and wins a free-kick off Florenzi. This is a decent chance to load the box for Porto. 7 min: El Shaarawy has a look down the left again and combines with the overlapping Kolarov, who\u2019s always an option in attack. The left-back fizzes a low ball into the six-yard box and almost finds Dzeko, but Casillas claims the cross. 5 min: The next time Porto have it at the back they launch it long. Probably wise. 4 min: Porto try to make like Manchester City at the back, only for Felipe to make a total mess of it. He loses out to Pellegrini and then compounds the error with a weak challenge that allows Roma to attack. El Shaarawy wanders down the left, wriggles inside the area and tries to set up Cristante, who\u2019s tackled just in time by Herrera. That was so very nearly a calamity for Porto. 3 min: A fast start, with plenty of intensity in midfield. It all looks quite even. Peep! Roma, in their red kit, get the game underway. They\u2019re kicking from right to left in the first half. De Rossi immediately pumps the ball forward and, er, out for a throw. Before kick-off, there will be a minute\u2019s silence to remember Emiliano Sala. Halfway through it respectful applause breaks out, which is a nice touch. The following Porto players miss the next game if they are booked: \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o, Ot\u00e1vio and Pepe. Of course Pepe. As for Roma, they have no such worries. Time for the Champions League anthem! Always brings a tear to the eye. Do sing along. Kolarov\u2019s belting it out. So\u2019s Pepe. The teams are in the tunnel and the Roma fans are making an absurd amount of noise at the Stadio Olimpico. They know how to turn up the volume on a big night there. I was there when they beat Barcelona last season and my ears have only just recovered. Roma: Mirante; Florenzi, Manolas, Fazio, Kolarov; Pellegrini, De Rossi, Cristante; Zaniolo, Dzeko, El Shaarawy. Subs: Olsen, Jesus, Marcano, Santon, Pastore, Kluivert, Nzonzi. Porto: Casillas; Militao, Felipe, Pepe, Telles; Herrera, Danilo, Fernando; Otavio, Soares, Brahimi. Subs: Vana, M Pereira, Costa, Hernani, Torres, Lopez, A Pereira. Referee: Danny Makkelie (Netherlands) Hello. The latter stages of the Champions League: a funny place to be if you aren\u2019t one of the super clubs. Shocks are rare in this competition and unpredictability is limited. If you don\u2019t have hundreds of millions to chuck around every summer, you can probably forget about winning it. If you don\u2019t have elite players, history suggests there\u2019s only so far you can go. But it is a knockout competition, so you never know, and both of these sides will reckon they have a fine chance of making the quarter-finals. Having finished second in their group, Roma must be pretty relieved not to have landed one of your Barcelonas or your Bayern Munichs or your PSGS. Having finished top of theirs, Porto must be pretty pleased to have avoided your Liverpools, your Atletico Madrids, your Manchester Uniteds. It\u2019s all to play for at the Stadio Olimpico this evening! And it\u2019s also very hard to call. Trying to pick a favourite isn\u2019t easy. Porto, top of the Portuguese league by a point and unbeaten since October, will be happy to have the second leg at home and Sergio Concecaio will feel confident that he has enough experience and firepower at his disposal to reach the last eight. But while Roma are having a sticky season domestically - Eusebio Di Francesco\u2019s side are sixth in Serie A after an inconsistent run of results and lost 7-1 to Fiorentina in the Coppa Italia last month \u2013 the Italians knocked out Barcelona on their way to reaching the last four last season and should represent a step up in class for Porto, who topped a group containing Galatasaray, Lokomotiv Moscow and Schalke. In conclusion: anything could happen. Which is just how it should be. Kick-off: 8pm GMT, 9pm in Rome.",

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government has suffered an historic defeat, losing the first substantive vote on the floor of the House of Representatives since 1929, after Labor and the crossbench stared down a bare-knuckle tactical offensive by the Coalition, including late advice that the medical evacuations bill was unconstitutional. The bill cleared the House after a day of high brinksmanship in Canberra, which started with backroom negotiations between Labor and key crossbenchers to adjust legislation passed by the Senate last December, and culminated with the government producing advice from the solicitor general that the proposal breached section 53 of the constitution. As the major parties faced off in a brutal power play in the House, the constitutional law expert Anne Twomey said the Coalition\u2019s tactics to avoid losing the vote risked elevating the issue to one of confidence. Twomey said the Coalition\u2019s assertion that the medevac bill was a money bill made it more likely its successful passage could be considered a de facto vote of no confidence in the government \u2013 an analysis the government categorically rejects. \u201cIf the bill actually gets passed against the wishes of the government, that would be an indication that the government has lost control over the finances of the country,\u201d Twomey told Sky News. The advice from the commonwealth solicitor general, tabled by the Speaker of the House, Tony Smith, against the wishes of the attorney general, Christian Porter, was that the proposal before the House breached the constitution because amendments passed by the Senate last December increased expenditure from a standing appropriation in breach of section 53. But the legal advice also noted that parliament and not the high court was the final arbiter on the proposal before it, in essence reinforcing the discretion of the parliament to chart its own course. Staring down the government\u2019s frantic efforts to head off the historic defeat, Labor produced a last-minute amendment ensuring that members of a newly created medical panel overseeing medical transfers of people from offshore detention would not receive any remuneration for their service, therefore bypassing the constitutional problem. Crossbenchers who supported the proposal also remained firm in the face of the concerted government fightback, and stuck through a series of votes to pass the proposal the group had agreed with Labor and the Greens over the course of Tuesday. Despite the setback, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, remained resolutely on the political offensive, declaring that the vote demonstrated Labor had failed to learn the lessons from of the past. He said Australia\u2019s border protection regime could not be adjusted without serious consequences. Setting up a swingeing election battle on border protection, Morrison said the events of the day demonstrated Labor did not have the \u201cmettle\u201d to do what was necessary to protect Australia\u2019s borders, and could not be \u201ctrusted\u201d to stop the deaths at sea. \u201cAustralia cannot trust Bill Shorten to make Australia stronger,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cEvery [boat] arrival is on Bill Shorten\u2019s head.\u201d Morrison said contingency plans had been put into place to manage the \u201crisks\u201d to the regime that Shorten and the crossbench had created, and the home affairs minister was already meeting with border command. The Labor leader said ensuring that people in offshore detention had access to proper medical treatment was a test of national character, not a sign of weakness. \u201cThis bill and the amendments are about character,\u201d Shorten told the House. \u201cIt is about how we treat sick people in our care.\u201d The amendments agreed between Labor and the crossbench widen the discretion of the home affairs minister to stop medical transfers if asylum seekers pose a security risk or have serious criminal records. The package also gives ministers 72 hours to make decisions, rather than the original proposal of 24 hours. It also limits the new procedures governing medical transfers to the cohort already on Nauru and Manus Island.

According to the broadcaster, Robbins said the government had \u201cgot to make them believe that the week beginning end of March ... extension is possible, but if they don\u2019t vote for the deal then the extension is a long one.\u201d The tactic appears to be aimed squarely at members of the backbench Tory European Research Group (ERG), who may fear Brexit could ultimately be cancelled altogether, if MPs accept a delay. \u201cThe issue is whether Brussels is clear on the terms of extension,\u201d Robbins was overheard saying. \u201cIn the end they will probably just give us an extension.\u201d On the backstop, Robbins appeared to confirm that the government\u2019s initial plan was for the backstop, which effectively keeps the UK in a customs union, to form a temporary \u201cbridge\u201d to the long-term trading relationship. \u201cThe big clash all along is the \u2018safety net\u2019,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cWe agreed a bridge but it came out as a \u2018safety net\u2019.\u201d Former Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) minister Steve Baker played down the leak, saying \u201cas a consummate civil servant, Mr Robbins is likely to be appalled by this story. Officials advise. Ministers decide. What matters ultimately is the policy of the prime minister and the cabinet.\u201d But another senior Brexiter said \u201cthe trouble with Mr Robbins is that he is a draughts player in a chess world\u201d. Robbins\u2019 revealing remarks are likely to embolden those ministers who are increasingly anxious about the threat of a no-deal Brexit. Several are privately signalling they are prepared to consider resigning in a fortnight\u2019s time to ensure the success of cross-party efforts to force May\u2019s hand, rather than allow her to continue gambling on a last-minute change of heart by Brexiter rebels. A government spokesman said \u201cwe don\u2019t propose to comment on alleged remarks from a private conversation. The government\u2019s focus is on securing the improvements parliament needs to pass a deal so we leave the EU on 29 March\u201d.

But May, in turn, blamed Labour for increasing uncertainty by failing to support her deal. Robbins\u2019 reported comments emerged after May cleared the way for a nerve-shredding, last-minute vote for her deal, by announcing that the government would seek to exclude the Brexit deal from the usual 21-day process under which parliament approves international treaties. MPs are due to vote on Thursday on a government motion, reaffirming their conditional acceptance of May\u2019s deal, if she secures changes to the controversial backstop. When the Valentine\u2019s Day vote was first mooted, it was regarded as a fresh opportunity for MPs to rule out no deal. But a cross-party group of MPs led by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, has opted not to table an amendment seeking to force the government to extend article 50, believing Conservative backbenchers are willing to give the prime minister another fortnight to continue negotiations in Brussels. Instead they published a revised bill, backed by senior Conservatives Caroline Spelman and Oliver Letwin, aimed at preventing no deal \u2013 and promised to table an amendment on 27 February, forcing the government to make time to pass it. \u201cThis bill creates a parliamentary safeguard to prevent us drifting into no deal by accident, and to prevent those crucial decisions being left until the final fortnight. The risks to jobs, the NHS and security from no deal are too great for us to stand back and let the government drift,\u201d Cooper said. The new amendment is likely to be the vehicle for Conservative MPs keen to prevent the prime minister from running down the clock and increasing the risk of an \u201caccidental\u201d no-deal Brexit. Labour has tabled its own amendment to Thursday\u2019s vote, putting in black and white her pledge to hold another amendable vote by 27 February, if she has not secured support for her deal by then.",

Kraigg Brathwaite edged his first ball between fielders in the slip cordon but after that it all went to plan. John Campbell sliced his first delivery and Moeen Ali, who is rarely sighted in the cordon, stuck out his right hand and there the ball came to rest. Then Anderson found Brathwaite\u2019s edge and this time the ball found the safe hands of Stokes at second slip.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"07a7e177ca9e0179e298fff8b8584e73930f0275\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07a7e177ca9e0179e298fff8b8584e73930f0275/0_70_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"West Indies\u2019 Roston Chase celebrates his century\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">West Indies\u2019 Roston Chase celebrates his century.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next edge, as Stuart Broad may recall, did not find a pair of secure hands. Shai Hope, yet to score, was given a reprieve by Jos Buttler at third slip, by one estimate the 98th dropped catch off his bowling in Broad\u2019s distinguished career. Without doubt the slip cordon has done Broad few favours on this tour. Here he dealt with the latest spillage with an upper lip as stiff as one would expect from the MCC\u2019s latest captain.</p> <p>There were two consequences of this drop. Soon Chris Woakes was spotted, a rare event on this tour, removing the boundary triangles on the rope at long-on. Obviously they were reflecting the sunlight into the eyes of the cordon. The second change was that Buttler was summarily removed from that cordon. He has a mixed record in the slips and suddenly Moeen had suggested that he could be effective there. It was, in fact, a sign of strength that Buttler was removed so rapidly; it meant that England are not over-sensitive to the delicate feelings of their players. In any case Buttler did not look too bothered.</p> <p>Next Anderson dispatched Darren Bravo, caught at slip by Root, and West Indies were rocking. Mark Wood followed Broad with the wind at his back. There were not quite the pyrotechnics of Sunday but those in the stands watched more eagerly such is the attraction of genuine pace and the batsmen jumped more gingerly. Soon Root\u2019s latest favourite toy had Hope caught in the covers from a leading edge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f69fae38b33aa500b7a82bd6760e63b016ccf7bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f69fae38b33aa500b7a82bd6760e63b016ccf7bb/0_48_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England\u2019s Joe Root shakes hands with West Indies\u2019 Shannon Gabriel after the match\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England\u2019s Joe Root shakes hands with West Indies\u2019 Shannon Gabriel after the match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After lunch Roston Chase dug in before expanding elegantly later in his innings, but a moment of self-destruction coupled with a fine throw from Joe Denly found Shimron Hetmyer out of his crease when seeking to complete a third run. Another fine catch by Stokes at slip brought the end of Shane Dowrich. This was Moeen\u2019s 175th Test wicket, taking him beyond Tony Lock. Only three England spinners are now ahead of him, Jim Laker (193), Graeme Swann (255) and Derek Underwood (297). This is a phenomenal achievement by Moeen.</p> <p>Of English spinners who have taken 100 Test wickets or more, only Swann plus Johnny Briggs, Bobby Peel and Colin Blythe before the first world war have a better strike rate; no one concedes runs as quickly (though this may be a sign of the times). Now one is tempted to describe Moeen as a bowler who bats \u2013 except when he plays for Worcestershire. These labels are not really helpful but he can take this as a compliment. In this series his bowling has been increasingly valuable to Root and he ended the series as England\u2019s leading wicket-taker.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>There were two more tail-end victims for Moeen amid some merry swinging from the tail and some more conventional strokeplay from Chase, who would end up unbeaten with a fine consolation century.

He got there with less perspiration and without ever damaging any footholds at all even when being swatted for six, as he was four times amid the last rites.</p>",

John Campbell sliced his first delivery and Moeen Ali, who is rarely sighted in the cordon, stuck out his right hand and there the ball came to rest. Then Anderson found Brathwaite\u2019s edge and this time the ball found the safe hands of Stokes at second slip. The next edge, as Stuart Broad may recall, did not find a pair of secure hands. Shai Hope, yet to score, was given a reprieve by Jos Buttler at third slip, by one estimate the 98th dropped catch off his bowling in Broad\u2019s distinguished career. Without doubt the slip cordon has done Broad few favours on this tour. Here he dealt with the latest spillage with an upper lip as stiff as one would expect from the MCC\u2019s latest captain. There were two consequences of this drop. Soon Chris Woakes was spotted, a rare event on this tour, removing the boundary triangles on the rope at long-on. Obviously they were reflecting the sunlight into the eyes of the cordon. The second change was that Buttler was summarily removed from that cordon. He has a mixed record in the slips and suddenly Moeen had suggested that he could be effective there. It was, in fact, a sign of strength that Buttler was removed so rapidly; it meant that England are not over-sensitive to the delicate feelings of their players. In any case Buttler did not look too bothered. Next Anderson dispatched Darren Bravo, caught at slip by Root, and West Indies were rocking. Mark Wood followed Broad with the wind at his back. There were not quite the pyrotechnics of Sunday but those in the stands watched more eagerly such is the attraction of genuine pace and the batsmen jumped more gingerly. Soon Root\u2019s latest favourite toy had Hope caught in the covers from a leading edge. After lunch Roston Chase dug in before expanding elegantly later in his innings, but a moment of self-destruction coupled with a fine throw from Joe Denly found Shimron Hetmyer out of his crease when seeking to complete a third run. Another fine catch by Stokes at slip brought the end of Shane Dowrich. This was Moeen\u2019s 175th Test wicket, taking him beyond Tony Lock. Only three England spinners are now ahead of him, Jim Laker (193), Graeme Swann (255) and Derek Underwood (297). This is a phenomenal achievement by Moeen. Of English spinners who have taken 100 Test wickets or more, only Swann plus Johnny Briggs, Bobby Peel and Colin Blythe before the first world war have a better strike rate; no one concedes runs as quickly (though this may be a sign of the times). Now one is tempted to describe Moeen as a bowler who bats \u2013 except when he plays for Worcestershire. These labels are not really helpful but he can take this as a compliment. In this series his bowling has been increasingly valuable to Root and he ended the series as England\u2019s leading wicket-taker. There were two more tail-end victims for Moeen amid some merry swinging from the tail and some more conventional strokeplay from Chase, who would end up unbeaten with a fine consolation century. So Moeen now has 177 Test wickets, which puts him equal with Angus Fraser. He got there with less perspiration and without ever damaging any footholds at all even when being swatted for six, as he was four times amid the last rites.",

Cromwell declined an interview request. \u201cThis is bigger trouble for the government than almost anything else that has come along so far,\u201d said Richard Johnston, a professor at the University of British Columbia and an expert in public opinion and elections. Opinion polls show Trudeau\u2019s Liberals have a slender lead over the official opposition Conservatives ahead of an election set for this October. \u201cMr Trudeau\u2019s ethical lapses and his disastrous handling of this latest scandal have thrown his government into chaos,\u201d the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, said in a statement. In 2017, Trudeau apologized after the office of the ethics commissioner said he had broken conflict-of-interest laws by accepting a vacation on a Bahamas island owned by the Aga Khan. Wilson-Raybould, 47, appointed justice minister when Trudeau\u2019s Liberals came to power in November 2015, is one of the most prominent indigenous politicians in federal politics.

Instead, the government will table a motion setting out its current plans, which MPs will be able to amend, to try to shape the process.</p> <p>The next date is 27 February.

      "bodyText": "After Theresa May\u2019s latest Brexit statement to the Commons we know some extra details about the timetable for the process \u2013 but not a whole lot more. What did Theresa May have to tell MPs on Tuesday? The prime minister reiterated the fact that the government intends to press ahead with seeking changes to the Irish backstop \u2013 the aspect of her Brexit deal that most enrages leavers in her own party. She said she had still not yet decided which of three potential options she will pursue \u2013 a unilateral exit mechanism; a time-limit; or the hi-tech solutions envisaged in the so-called \u201cMalthouse compromise\u201d. She also reiterated the government\u2019s opposition to Labour\u2019s proposed condition of staying in a customs union to back a deal, but stressed commitment to maintaining workers\u2019 and environmental rights. What do we know about the timetable? May confirmed that the next deadline of Thursday will \u2013 as widely assumed \u2013 not see a revised deal put to the Commons. Instead, the government will table a motion setting out its current plans, which MPs will be able to amend, to try to shape the process. The next date is 27 February. May confirmed in her statement that if by then she has still not put a revised deal to parliament, the government will table another amendable motion. The PM indicated she could well table a deal later than this, saying that the government would, if needed, seek to set aside the usual rules which dictate that international treaties need 21 parliamentary working days before they can be ratified. What will happen on Thursday? Not so much, it would seem. It had been billed as another chance for MPs to try to extend article 50 or seek to prevent a no-deal departure, after an initial motion at the end of last month saw the Commons turn down such ideas, and instead opt for a scheme by the leading Tory backbencher Graham Brady seeking changes to the backstop. However, it seems most MPs will now wait until the end of the month, mindful that amendments are unlikely to win enough support this time given Conservative MPs are minded to give May another couple of weeks to talk to the EU. What will May do then? Barring a hugely unexpected change of heart in Brussels she will not get the EU to agree to the legally-binding changes to the backstop demanded by many Tories. This will leave the prime minister having to instead either persuade her MPs and the Democratic Unionist Party to accept a lesser tweak to the backstop, which seems a tough ask, or put together a plan which would win over enough Labour MPs to see her over the line. The risk for May then would be that such a plan would involve enough concessions, particularly over a possible customs union, to split the Conservatives. Could she delay the process further? There is definitely worry among many MPs that May could either inadvertently trigger a no-deal Brexit by vacillating too long in search of a non-existent breakthrough, or even that she might actively prefer this to a deal which would split her party. While the consensus sentiment for now is to allow the prime minister to reach the 27 February deadline unimpeded, a number of Conservative MPs say efforts by her to delay further would most likely trigger ministerial resignations and moves by the Commons to seize control of the process. On Tuesday, a new cross-party plan led by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper and Conservative grandee Oliver Letwin was published, stating that without a resolution by the end of the month they will table an amendment to guarantee parliamentary time for a bill to give MPs a vote between no deal and an extension to article 50.",

      "bodyText": "Six universities in England paid their vice-chancellors \u00a3500,000 or more in salary, bonuses and benefits last year, while nearly half of all VCs received more than \u00a3300,000, according to the higher education regulator\u2019s first survey of senior staff pay. The Open University, London Business School and the University of East London topped the table for leaders\u2019 remuneration, with the OU paying out \u00a3718,000 in 2017-18, including compensation for loss of office, to its departed vice-chancellor Peter Horrocks. The figures from the Office for Students (OfS) watchdog suggest that calls for pay restraint have had little effect. Average pay for top staff \u2013 not including benefits, such as accommodation and pension pots, given to many vice-chancellors \u2013 rose by 3.5% in a year, from \u00a3245,000 to \u00a3253,000. Below the most senior level, more than 60% of universities increased the number of staff paid \u00a3100,000 and above in 2017-18. Overall, there was a 15% rise in staff in the \u00a3100,000-plus pay band. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said it was wrong that vice-chancellors\u2019 pay was growing while frontline staff faced real-terms pay cuts and students had mounting debts. \u201cThis is just another result of the Tories\u2019 failed free-market experiment in higher education. There is no sign that the government will take serious action to tackle the endemic inequality in our universities,\u201d Rayner said. Dominic Shellard, the vice-chancellor of De Montfort University in Leicester, received the highest pay rise in England last year, the report revealed. De Montfort had announced on Monday that Shellard was leaving his role, in unexplained circumstances, having last year awarded him a 22% increase, taking his total pay to \u00a3358,000. The University and College Union said the continued rise in pay showed the new universities regulator, launched in England last year, was a \u201cpaper tiger\u201d that had failed to halt the increase in wealth being transferred to senior management. \u201cThe OfS fails to ask why some vice-chancellors are still picking up double-digit pay rises and doesn\u2019t even look at their expenses or other benefits in kind. This report sends a message that those who accept such largesse have nothing to fear from the new regulator,\u201d said Matt Waddup, UCU\u2019s head of policy. Waddup noted that Nicola Dandridge, the OfS\u2019s chief executive, told MPs last year that universities would have to justify executive pay above \u00a3150,000. But, he noted, only four out of 133 institutions paid their vice-chancellors less than \u00a3150,000. \u201cWith this lightweight report the OfS has shown itself to be a paper tiger incapable of stopping the pay and perks scandals that have plagued universities,\u201d Waddup said. Dandridge defended the regulator\u2019s approach. \u201cIt is not for the Office for Students to set a vice-chancellor\u2019s pay.

If carried out, without substantial replacement funding from the Treasury, the sector would lose a substantial portion of the income that many rely upon after years of rapid expansion. The Guardian reported last week that Reading University\u2019s debts has risen to nearly 100% of its annual income, following two years of operating deficits totalling more than \u00a340m, including \u00a327m lost on a joint venture in Malaysia.",

News outlets have long complained that Facebook and Google, which together account for the vast majority of digital advertising in the UK, have sucked out billions of pounds of revenue that previously supported the cost of journalism. The culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, told the House of Commons on Tuesday that he had asked the Competition and Markets Authority to launch a study of the \u201clargely opaque and extremely complex\u201d world of online advertising. The study could lead to a full-blown investigation, which would allow the competition regulator to use its legal powers to obtain information from the secretive technology companies. The recommendation to launch the inquiry was included in Dame Frances Cairncross\u2019s report on the future of the press, which was released on Monday. News outlets have struggled to compete with the scale and targeted advertising offered by the technology companies, which have an enormous amount of data about their users. Wright, who has previously insisted he does read newspapers, also said he had asked the Charity Commission to investigate Cairncross\u2019s recommendation for a form of charitable status for news outlets that focus on local and investigative journalism. The cabinet minister told the Commons that civil servants in his department would also conduct a separate investigation into the regulation of the wider online advertising market, which posed \u201csocial and economic challenges\u201d in its current state. This Whitehall investigation could result in a regulator being given new powers to oversee the online advertising marketplace, in line with the government\u2019s wider policy of ensuring the rules and regulations that apply to offline institutions also apply to their internet equivalents. Wright also said he would ask the media regulator, Ofcom, to examine whether the BBC was harming for-profit local newspapers by invading their turf and publishing material for free. However, he appeared to be less enthusiastic about Cairncross\u2019s recommendation that the government should establish an institute for public interest news to promote investigative and local journalism, which would distribute money from the state and other donors to support local reporting.

      "bodyText": "Four Nigerian women at the centre of a long-running legal battle against oil giant Royal Dutch Shell saw their historic case reach the Hague on Tuesday. The company is accused of complicity in the state execution of nine Ogoni protesters and human right abuses dating back to 1993. The allegations concern the 1990s violent government crackdown in Ogoniland, in the oil-rich Niger delta region, where oil spills inflicted environmental damage on a huge scale. The Netherlands court will decide whether a case can proceed after hearing arguments from both sides on Tuesday. The landmark case, brought by the widows of four of the Ogoni nine \u2013 Esther Kiobel, Victoria Bera, Blessing Eawo and Charity Levula \u2013 allege Shell was complicit in the Nigerian government\u2019s policy of brutally quelling protests, and with human rights abuses that were aimed at protecting the company\u2019s staff and infrastructure, actions that ultimately led to the death of their husbands. Peaceful demonstrations by Ogoni people against Shell\u2019s widespread, devastating pollution ended in a brutal backlash by Nigerian security forces, who allegedly killed, maimed, raped and tortured hundreds of people who lived in the area. Nine members of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (Mosop), including its leader, Ken Saro-Wiwa, were executed in 1995 by the Nigerian authorities, following a trial that was widely discredited. Esther Kiobel\u2019s husband, Dr Barinem Kiobel, was one of those executed. \u201cOver the years, Shell has continually fought to make sure this case is not heard in court. They have the resources to fight me instead of doing justice for my husband,\u201d said Esther Kiobel. The 1993 military coup in Nigeria, led by General Sani Abacha, brought a clampdown on political activity, with opponents jailed or executed. A new security task force (ISTF) focused on Ogoniland, applying brute force in an effort to end the protest. During its first deployment they shot five people outside Shell\u2019s compound at Rumuobiokani. Amnesty International has reported that ISTF carried out up to 50 extrajudicial executions, alongside torture and rape. The government\u2019s forces left hundreds more dead and many more homeless when villages were destroyed. In May 1994, four Ogoni leaders \u2013 Edward N Kobani, Albert T Badey, Samuel N Orage and Theophilus B Orage \u2013 were attacked and beaten by an angry mob, who then set their corpses on fire. Blaming the deaths on internal Mosop wrangling, ISTF arrested Saro-Wiwa, Kiobel and 12 others and charged them with incitement to murder, and murder. Nine were found guilty \u2013 Barinem Kiobel, Ken Saro-Wiwa, Baribor Bera, Saturday Dobee, Nordu Eawo, Daniel Gbokoo, John Kpuinen, Paul Levula and Felix Nuate \u2013 and were hanged in November 1995. Unable to seek recourse in Nigerian courts, Esther Kiobel first filed a case against Shell in the US in 2002. The company deny allegations of complicity in the death of the Ogoni nine or in the widespread human rights abuses, although it acknowledged an awareness of Nigeria\u2019s military action to protect its infrastructure. In 2009, Shell agreed a $15.5m out-of-court settlement with the families of the dead men, stating that it was to cover their legal costs and recognition of events that took place in Ogoniland. The US court declined jurisdiction and in 2017, with the assistance of Amnesty International, the case was re-filed in the Netherlands. In a letter to Amnesty International in June 2017, Osagie Okunbor, managing director of Shell-Nigeria, refuted allegations of misconduct and said, \u201cWe were shocked and saddened when we heard the news of the executions. Shell Nigeria appealed to the Nigerian government to grant clemency.\u201d Mark Dummett, researcher at Amnesty International, said: \u201cThese women believe that their husbands would still be alive today were it not for the brazen self-interest of Shell. This is an historic moment which has huge significance for people everywhere who have been harmed by the greed and recklessness of global corporations.\u201d This morning at the Hague, plaintiffs Esther Kiobel and Victoria Bera gave evidence to the court.

With just 45 days to go until the UK leaves the EU, the government still has no idea on what terms a deal \u2013 if any \u2013 can be reached. Nor does anyone seem particularly bothered. We are now in a world where the prime minister can rewrite history, Gavin Williamson can declare war on China, Chris Grayling has mystic visions of non-existent ferries and no one bats an eyelid. Shares in Mogadon have rocketed as parliament sleepwalks towards Brexit. Theresa May couldn\u2019t believe her luck. At the very least, she had expected some grief for having missed yet another essay deadline. But everyone appeared to have forgotten she had missed the previous deadline. And the one before that. And the one before that. Even better, no one even asked her if she had made any progress since the last deadline she had missed. Which was just as well because she hadn\u2019t made any. Instead, in her latest statement to the Commons on what she hadn\u2019t been doing to push the Brexit peanut forward, the prime minister was allowed to get away with reading out a letter she had written to Jeremy Corbyn some days earlier about how \u2013 sucks teeth \u2013 everything was very tricky but though she really, really cared about workers\u2019 rights \u2013 yawn \u2013 she couldn\u2019t possibly agree to a customs union as the ERG wouldn\u2019t go for it.

Corbyn\u2019s strength on the stump accounts for some of Labour\u2019s performance. But so does May\u2019s self-destructive campaign, reinforcing caricatures of Tory nastiness and repelling anyone with doubts about Brexit. On 8 June 2017 three forces combined to Labour\u2019s benefit: Corbynism, vaguer anti-Toryism and remain \u2013 in what proportions no one knows. The fault lines were then concealed by an outbreak of loyalty among Labour MPs. Those who had expected voters to despise Corbyn\u2019s candidacy were chastened. For various reasons (some genuine reappraisal of the leader\u2019s qualities and an absence of better ideas) the moderates mostly fell into line. Many found sanctuary in the pro-European cause, which brought reconciliation with the rank and file membership.

His refusal to show any regret for a career spent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/13/jeremy-corbyn-labour-leadership-foreign-policy-antisemitism\" title=\"\">rubbing shoulders with antisemites</a> has pushed others to despair. But the European question has kept many dissidents from quitting. They thought they had a better chance of influencing the Brexit outcome from inside the party. That conviction has crumbled in recent weeks. Corbyn\u2019s Euroscepticism is on display more clearly than at any time since his days as a backbencher, when he denounced the EU as a sinister imperial project. Old videos of him railing against the Brussels enemy as a \u201cmilitary Frankenstein\u201d are now <a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/watch-jeremy-corbyn-describes-eu-as-massive-great-frankenstein-1-5879503\" title=\"\">gleefully shared</a> by Ukippers online. The Labour leader\u2019s constant reluctance to back a second referendum was for months excused as tactical caution. Increasingly, it looks like sabotage.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How many voters would identify with a movement born in simultaneous aversion to Corbyn and Brexit? No one can be sure</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Labour pro-Europeans have been taken for a ride. Their Tory equivalents are now grasping the scale of their symmetrical defeat. Moderate Conservatives once predicted that Brexit bluster would be dispelled by diplomatic reality and that Commons arithmetic would impose a sensible settlement on May. There is still time for that to happen, but not much. Away from Westminster, the party is in an uncompromising mood. Earlier this week, Grantham Conservatives initiated the <a href=\"https://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2019/01/trouble-in-grantham-boless-association-executive-intends-to-accelerate-deselection-proceedings-against-him.html\" title=\"\">process to deselect Nick Boles</a>, their local MP.

      "bodyText": "A casual observer seeing Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn exchange rhetorical blows over Brexit in the Commons today might imagine that they stand on opposite sides of this totemic issue. But veterans of the debate know they are equal in determination that Britain should leave the EU. They are separated from consensus by small technical matters that can, for theatrical effect, be inflated into irreconcilable differences. That process is testimony to the hold that the two-party system exerts over English politics and to much of what is wrong with it. Brexit keeps promising to break party lines and then failing to do so. That is partly because pro-Europeanism and the British left stand on overlapping cultural ground. The remain proposition goes well beyond attachment to EU membership: it is driven by revulsion at the nativist spirit of Brexit\u2019s marauding generals \u2013 Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg \u2013 and shock that they have hijacked Britain\u2019s political identity. But that dismay is not exclusive to Labour. It is felt by liberal Tories and swing voters who just pine for competent, rational government. The result of the last general election was confusing, in that sense. Corbyn\u2019s strength on the stump accounts for some of Labour\u2019s performance. But so does May\u2019s self-destructive campaign, reinforcing caricatures of Tory nastiness and repelling anyone with doubts about Brexit. On 8 June 2017 three forces combined to Labour\u2019s benefit: Corbynism, vaguer anti-Toryism and remain \u2013 in what proportions no one knows. The fault lines were then concealed by an outbreak of loyalty among Labour MPs. Those who had expected voters to despise Corbyn\u2019s candidacy were chastened. For various reasons (some genuine reappraisal of the leader\u2019s qualities and an absence of better ideas) the moderates mostly fell into line. Many found sanctuary in the pro-European cause, which brought reconciliation with the rank and file membership. MPs who had been out in the cold because of their hostility to Corbyn took a warm bath in grassroots affinity for remain. The internal opposition was dormant, not extinct. Corbyn\u2019s mealy-mouthed response to the Salisbury poisonings, marked by reluctance to blame the Kremlin, drove some MPs to distraction. His refusal to show any regret for a career spent rubbing shoulders with antisemites has pushed others to despair. But the European question has kept many dissidents from quitting. They thought they had a better chance of influencing the Brexit outcome from inside the party. That conviction has crumbled in recent weeks. Corbyn\u2019s Euroscepticism is on display more clearly than at any time since his days as a backbencher, when he denounced the EU as a sinister imperial project. Old videos of him railing against the Brussels enemy as a \u201cmilitary Frankenstein\u201d are now gleefully shared by Ukippers online. The Labour leader\u2019s constant reluctance to back a second referendum was for months excused as tactical caution. Increasingly, it looks like sabotage. Labour pro-Europeans have been taken for a ride. Their Tory equivalents are now grasping the scale of their symmetrical defeat. Moderate Conservatives once predicted that Brexit bluster would be dispelled by diplomatic reality and that Commons arithmetic would impose a sensible settlement on May. There is still time for that to happen, but not much. Away from Westminster, the party is in an uncompromising mood. Earlier this week, Grantham Conservatives initiated the process to deselect Nick Boles, their local MP. His offence was to say he would renounce the Tory whip sooner than endorse a no-deal Brexit. A few days earlier, Labour\u2019s MP for Liverpool Wavertree, Luciana Berger, had faced charges of disloyalty to Corbyn. A no-confidence motion against her was withdrawn only when noxious social media posts from within the constituency party made it impossible to deny that Berger was targeted in part because she is Jewish. These episodes are symptomatic of a purifying mania that will shrink the two broad churches of English politics into intolerant sects. One quivers in anticipation of Brexit rapture; the other hunts blasphemies against the supreme leader. Many Labour MPs see this process as irreversible. Corbyn commands the members\u2019 faith. When he goes, his successor will pledge to honour his legacy. A similar realisation is dawning on moderate Tories. A successful candidate to replace May must seek endorsement from the Europhobic backbench commissars. It is certain, on those trajectories, that MPs will leave their current parties. But to what end? Obstacles to a new venture are familiar. The electoral system suffocates startups. A gang of refuseniks from left and right would disagree on issues that Brexit has obscured, starting with tax-and-spend policies. There is already a pro-EU centre-party, the Liberal Democrats, which is not surfing any vast anti-Brexit backlashes. Schismatic Labour MPs say Vince Cable\u2019s tribe would fold into a fresher-looking insurgency, but even then the target audience is uncertain. Labour and Tories marshall diverse voter coalitions.

      "bodyText": "Tens of thousands of demonstrators have poured back on to the streets of Caracas and towns and cities across Venezuela to intensify their mutiny against Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. \u201cWe want Maduro out and we want a free Venezuela,\u201d said Kisbell Vargas, 27, who was part of a tsunami of dissent that swept west across Venezuela\u2019s capital on Tuesday morning. Vargas, from a shantytown in eastern Caracas called La Urbina, was marching with a homemade placard that read: \u201cUnderstand Maduro, Venezuela doesn\u2019t want you.\u201d \u201cWhile the people are going hungry, they have all the food and the medicine they need,\u201d she complained. \u201cI have a seven-year-old daughter and I want her to grow up in the Venezuela I was born into. A Venezuela where you don\u2019t live under any kind of regime.\u201d Stefani Fonseca, a protester from the Petare shantytown, had also come to demand the exit of Maduro, who is fighting for political survival after a dramatic challenge from Juan Guaid\u00f3, an opposition leader now recognized as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate leader by dozens of western governments, including Britain and the US. \u201cWe are living under a dictatorship,\u201d said Fonseca, 21. \u201cVenezuela is too rich a country to be in this situation. It\u2019s not that we lack resources. It is that we have too many thieves.\u201d There was a carnival atmosphere as the crowd surged down Avenida Francisco de Miranda past constant reminders of Venezuela\u2019s economic collapse: abandoned construction sites, graffiti denouncing poverty and hunger, and a paint-spattered government building from which a CCTV cameras and a giant image of Maduro stared down on protesters. Street hawkers sold Guaid\u00f3 T-shirts and hoodies and politically charged baseball hats emblazoned with the slogan: \u201cMake Venezuela D\u2019Pinga [Shit hot] Again\u201d. \u201cWe have already won,\u201d boasted Abrahan Fern\u00e1ndez, a 28-year-old student activist from the opposition party Primero Justicia. \u201cToday we have defeated the dictatorship and we have a president called Juan Guaid\u00f3.\u201d But there was also anger \u2013 and anxiety \u2013 that Maduro was still in power. \u201cHow are things in my community? We have no water, no cleaning, no food,\u201d said Fonseca, who carried a banner reading: \u201cThe struggle cannot just be on Twitter and Instagram. The struggle is in the streets!\u201d Asked what her message to Maduro would be, Fonseca responded with a barrage of expletives. Rose Patricia Valdivia, 63, said she was encouraged residents of working class areas traditionally loyal to Chavismo had joined the revolt. \u201cFor the first time the barrios are taking to the streets,\u201d she said of the redbrick slums whose residents have been targeted by special forces for daring to protest. Her husband, Juan Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez, said he saw only one solution to the crisis: the departure of Maduro \u201cand all the Chavistas and Maduristas around him who have led us into this disaster\u201d. But with Maduro refusing to step down and no sign yet of Venezuela\u2019s military turning on him, Valdivia admitted people power alone would not be enough. \u201cSo we have to pressure them, force them to go.\u201d As the rebellion against Maduro enters its forth week, that reality is beginning to dawn on many members of Venezuela\u2019s newly energized opposition who had hoped he would already have fallen. Luis Pedro Espa\u00f1a, a sociologist who is part of an opposition group planning Venezuela\u2019s post-Maduro reconstruction, admitted Maduro and his inner circle were only likely to give up power if military power obliged them to. \u201cWe are depending on a military action \u2013 or the threat of a military action \u2013 internal or external,\u201d Espa\u00f1a said. Espa\u00f1a said he believed a political transition was only now likely if the armed forces acted against Maduro. \u201cMight that something be violent? Yes. Might it not be violent? I hope it won\u2019t be violent,\u201d he said.

His officials staged a counter-rally through downtown Caracas on Tuesday in a show of support for their embattled leader. \u201cThey want to intervene because we have the greatest riches on earth,\u201d complained Jaime Gonz\u00e1lez, 75, a retired carpenter and Maduro supporter. \u201cThey want to invade to take all of these riches off us.\u201d In an interview with the BBC, Maduro accused the channel of being part of a \u201cwar campaign\u201d against Venezuela and claimed his international foes had invented a fake humanitarian crisis to justify military intervention. \u201cDo we have problems?

Addressing protesters in Caracas, Guaid\u00f3 said the aid would enter Venezuela on 23 February, and called on the country\u2019s armed forces to let the shipments in.

In those days, the mid-1980s, Nyk\u00e4nen was the best ski jumper in the world and almost unbeatable. The records were the least of it.

He died last week, at the age of 55.

He was eight years old. That was on the hill in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, where he grew up, 150 miles north of Helsinki. He enjoyed jumping so much that he became obsessed with it. He was a hyperactive child and the sport became his outlet for all his excess energy.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe only thing I wanted was to jump,\u201d he said, \u201cand to jump, and to jump again.\u201d His local hill had a chairlift and floodlights, which meant he could go on late into the night. By the time he was 12 he was practising for nine hours a day, watched over by his canny coach, Matti Pulli.</p> \n<p>Nyk\u00e4nen was just 18, and in his first full season on the senior circuit, when he won the world championship at Holmenkollen in Oslo, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF0IHJ5Z-K0\" title=\"\">jumping in fog so thick</a> that he could hardly see the end of his skis, let alone the bottom of the slope. In 1984, he won the Olympic gold on the large hill in Sarajevo, in a competition that became famous for his duel with the German jumper Jens Weissflog. At Calgary in 1988, where the British fell for Eddie \u201cthe Eagle\u201d Edwards, Nyk\u00e4nen swept all three gold medals, winning on the large hill and the normal hill and in the team event.</p> \n<p>Even then, Nyk\u00e4nen\u2019s drinking was a problem. He took his first sip when he was 14 and never really lost the taste for it. He was kicked off the national team once in 1985, and again in 1987, because his behaviour was so disruptive. \u201cWhen he\u2019s drunk and you say the wrong word,\u201d his teammate Jari Puikkonen said at the time, \u201che\u2019s going to hit you with his fists.\u201d His biographer Egon Thiener said Nyk\u00e4nen had \u201ca Jekyll and Hyde\u201d personality. \u201cWhen sober, he\u2019s one of the nicest and friendliest people I\u2019ve ever met. When drunk, he\u2019s dangerous and aggressive.\u201d</p> \n<p>Later, long after he had quit jumping, Nyk\u00e4nen was sentenced to 26 months in prison after he stabbed a friend in the back, twice, because he beat him in a game of finger wrestling. They were so drunk that Nyk\u00e4nen explained he couldn\u2019t remember anything about it. That was in 2004, when Nyk\u00e4nen was deep into his wilderness years. In the 90s he was talked into launching a pop career and, while his first album sold well, the second one bombed. He decided to try a spell in politics, then became a lounge singer in a local restaurant. He ended up selling his gold medals because he needed the cash.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>At the end of the decade Nyk\u00e4nen was working as a stripper in a casino, where he was booed off stage because he refused to take all his clothes off.

His catchphrases became famous. \u201cThe odds are 50-60\u201d, \u201cevery chance is an opportunity\u201d, \u201clife is live\u201d, and \u201cmaybe I did, maybe I didn\u2019t\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Matti Nyk\u00e4nen used to fly so far, so fast that it felt as if he would never come down. When the Finn broke the world ski jump record for the fifth, and final, time at Planica in 1985 he was moving so quickly that the cameraman struggled to track him through the air. Watching the footage you wonder if he might disappear into the yonder off the far side of the screen. In those days, the mid-1980s, Nyk\u00e4nen was the best ski jumper in the world and almost unbeatable. The records were the least of it. He won five world titles, five Olympic medals, including three golds in one Games, and four World Cups. Nyk\u00e4nen had an otherworldly talent but not the sense, or support, he needed to cope with the fame it won him. When he published his authorised biography in 2006 he called it Greetings From Hell. \u201cHell,\u201d he said, \u201ccan\u2019t be as bad as my life has been.\u201d He was one of the greatest Winter Olympic athletes and one the finest sportspeople Finland has ever had, and he was also a singer and a stripper, an alcoholic and a wife-beater. He died last week, at the age of 55. In one of his last public appearances, a singing gig in Helsinki, he told his audience: \u201cConsider yourself lucky your name isn\u2019t Matti Nyk\u00e4nen.\u201d The first time Nyk\u00e4nen tried ski jumping it was on a dare from his father. He was eight years old. That was on the hill in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, where he grew up, 150 miles north of Helsinki. He enjoyed jumping so much that he became obsessed with it. He was a hyperactive child and the sport became his outlet for all his excess energy. \u201cThe only thing I wanted was to jump,\u201d he said, \u201cand to jump, and to jump again.\u201d His local hill had a chairlift and floodlights, which meant he could go on late into the night. By the time he was 12 he was practising for nine hours a day, watched over by his canny coach, Matti Pulli. Nyk\u00e4nen was just 18, and in his first full season on the senior circuit, when he won the world championship at Holmenkollen in Oslo, jumping in fog so thick that he could hardly see the end of his skis, let alone the bottom of the slope. In 1984, he won the Olympic gold on the large hill in Sarajevo, in a competition that became famous for his duel with the German jumper Jens Weissflog. At Calgary in 1988, where the British fell for Eddie \u201cthe Eagle\u201d Edwards, Nyk\u00e4nen swept all three gold medals, winning on the large hill and the normal hill and in the team event. Even then, Nyk\u00e4nen\u2019s drinking was a problem. He took his first sip when he was 14 and never really lost the taste for it. He was kicked off the national team once in 1985, and again in 1987, because his behaviour was so disruptive. \u201cWhen he\u2019s drunk and you say the wrong word,\u201d his teammate Jari Puikkonen said at the time, \u201che\u2019s going to hit you with his fists.\u201d His biographer Egon Thiener said Nyk\u00e4nen had \u201ca Jekyll and Hyde\u201d personality. \u201cWhen sober, he\u2019s one of the nicest and friendliest people I\u2019ve ever met. When drunk, he\u2019s dangerous and aggressive.\u201d Later, long after he had quit jumping, Nyk\u00e4nen was sentenced to 26 months in prison after he stabbed a friend in the back, twice, because he beat him in a game of finger wrestling. They were so drunk that Nyk\u00e4nen explained he couldn\u2019t remember anything about it. That was in 2004, when Nyk\u00e4nen was deep into his wilderness years. In the 90s he was talked into launching a pop career and, while his first album sold well, the second one bombed. He decided to try a spell in politics, then became a lounge singer in a local restaurant. He ended up selling his gold medals because he needed the cash. At the end of the decade Nyk\u00e4nen was working as a stripper in a casino, where he was booed off stage because he refused to take all his clothes off. He appeared in a porn film, too, and took a job working on a phone line for a time, giving callers advice on their love lives. \u201cI\u2019m a marriage adviser these days,\u201d he told the sportswriter Ian Chadband, \u201cif things are going well then call me. I can fuck it up in seven seconds.\u201d Nyk\u00e4nen was married six times, twice to the same woman, Mervi Tapola, who suffered horribly through the decade they were together. She filed for divorce 15 times before they finally split in 2010 after he was accused of trying to strangle her. Eventually, a younger generation of Finns had forgotten why Nyk\u00e4nen was famous to begin with. They only knew him from the tabloids. Editors used to joke that he had sold more newspapers than anyone alive. His catchphrases became famous. \u201cThe odds are 50-60\u201d, \u201cevery chance is an opportunity\u201d, \u201clife is live\u201d, and \u201cmaybe I did, maybe I didn\u2019t\u201d. That last one ended up as the slogan for the cider he was shilling even while he was drinking himself to death. \u201cWe tried many, many ways to help him,\u201d said his coach, Pulli. \u201cWe tried the clinics, but whenever he came back he would go drinking again.\u201d They say that in the last years of his life, Nyk\u00e4nen was getting better. He had married again and had apparently gone sober, though no one really knows whether it would have lasted. Matti Nyk\u00e4nen fell so far, so fast, it felt as if he could never get up.",

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s general secretary has defended her absence from a parliamentary party meeting on antisemitism and warned MPs against attacking staff dealing with the crisis. Jennie Formby wrote to MPs on Tuesday night in response to a letter by several MPs expressing their anger that no one from the party leadership had taken questions at Monday night\u2019s meeting about the news that the party had investigated 673 cases of alleged antisemitism and expelled 12 members. Formby, who released the figures to MPs before the meeting, said she had made it clear early on to John Cryer, the secretary of the parliamentary Labour party, that she could not attend. \u201cI absolutely reject the suggestion in the letter that the leadership of the party has ignored the views of the PLP,\u201d Formby wrote. \u201cThe constant and often public criticism of our dedicated and talented staff team is unacceptable and is causing them considerable distress.\u201d Formby hit back specifically at a claim made by the MP Margaret Hodge that cast doubt on the figures, saying she alone had submitted a dossier of 200 examples of antisemitism. Formby said investigations had found those complaints referred to 111 reported individuals, of whom only 20 were members. During Monday\u2019s meeting, MPs criticised the fact that the figures only included complaints made since April last year, and said there were questions over the criteria by which some members had received a conduct reminder and no further action. Formy responded: \u201cTo identify complaints of antisemitism, staff would have to go through every single complaint received in the earlier period. This would be hugely time-consuming and would take their efforts away from the important task of processing complaints.\u201d However, she confirmed the party had expelled seven members before April. The party\u2019s former general secretary Iain McNicol had questioned Formby\u2019s previous assertion that there had been no system in place for tracking complaints before April. Formby said she could not answer MPs\u2019 requests about money spent on legal fees for the cases, but said there had been \u201csignificant investment in stamping out the issue of antisemitism\u201d, including hiring another six staff. The meeting was held after the deputy leader, Tom Watson, clashed with the party chair, Ian Lavery, at the weekly shadow cabinet meeting about the case of the Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Berger. A Labour source said Corbyn and other Labour MPs had expressed solidarity with Berger and the antisemitic abuse she had received, saying it was right that her constituency Labour party had withdrawn a planned vote of no confidence in her. However, it is understood Lavery staunchly defended the local party\u2019s right to hold their MP to account. \u201cHe was the loudest voice defending the CLP as others expressed solidarity with Luciana,\u201d one source said. The motion was apparently pulled under pressure from Labour HQ, after it emerged that one of Berger\u2019s key opponents within the local party, Kenneth Campbell, had said she should be \u201cexposed for the disruptive Zionist she is\u201d. The chair of Wavertree CLP, Alex Scott-Samuel, was also revealed to have been a regular on a chat show on the website of conspiracy theorist David Icke. That show\u2019s host, Richie Allen, who has now parted ways with Icke, has also hosted the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and Alison Chabloz, a self-described \u201cHolocaust revisionist\u201d. Watson had urged the party to consider suspending the local party, a suggestion which was rejected by Formby. Berger has faced increasingly persistent antisemitic abuse and had a police escort at last year\u2019s Labour party conference after receiving death threats. In the letter to Corbyn signed by Berger, Hodge, Louise Ellman, John Mann, Catherine McKinnell, Ruth Smeeth and Wes Streeting, the MPs said further information was needed by the end of Wednesday. They said the PLP demanded to see information about complaints made before April 2018, the money spent on legal counsel, the organisations providing antisemitism training, and how the party was implementing a duty of care to its MPs. \u201cThe failure to respect the request for this simple information does nothing to dispel the accusation that Labour is an institutionally antisemitic organisation,\u201d they wrote. A Labour source said Formby had made a commitment to constantly review the processes for determining sanctions when there was evidence of antisemitic behaviour. \u201cThere was a commitment from all of the shadow cabinet to rebuilding trust and the historic relationship with the Jewish community, as well as supporting party members and party democracy,\u201d the source said. A party spokesperson said Formby\u2019s letter answered the MPs\u2019 questions \u201ctransparently\u201d and explained the progress being made in dealing with antisemitism cases. \u201cShe reiterates her commitment to continuing the work to improve the party\u2019s complaints procedures \u2026 praises the dedicated hard work of Labour party staff who deal with complaints and commits to ongoing constructive engagement with the PLP.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Trump administration is still tearing young children away from their parents when they cross the US-Mexico border unlawfully, despite formally ending the policy of family separations last summer, according to immigration advocates in Texas. In El Paso on Monday, on the day Donald Trump held a rally in the border city, a mother sobbed as she told how she arrived in the US from Honduras last October and had her two daughters, aged five and three, taken away from her without explanation. It was a month before she was allowed to speak to her girls, by phone, and then see them for one hour a week. They were reunited after four months and are now staying in El Paso, in western Texas, while authorities process the asylum application of their mother, Yeimi, who asked to withhold her last name out of security concerns. \u201cIt was four months in which I got very depressed and very anxious. I felt I couldn\u2019t control it but I knew I had to do my best to keep my daughters calm when I spoke to them on the phone, even though I wasn\u2019t,\u201d Yeimi said on Monday at Annunciation House, a local not-for-profit in El Paso that shelters immigrants released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). When she first got to speak to the young girls, after they were taken away by Customs and Border Protection, she said: \u201cMy daughters cried a lot and told me they needed to be with their mother.\u201d Taylor Levy, legal coordinator for Annunciation House, said Yeimi\u2019s case is not an anomaly. She said Annunciation House receives one or two calls a week about new cases of family separations \u2013 and that is just cases their agency knows about in the El Paso area. Between May and June last year, the administration divided thousands of children from their parents, detaining them in separate facilities, after announcing a \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy against illegal border crossing from migrants seeking refuge or a new start in the US. Trump officially ended the policy in June amid growing uproar over scenes of distress as families were torn apart, adults harried through criminal courts and children, including babies and toddlers, kept in often harsh detention facilities. Trump said at the time that he made the executive order to end the policy because: \u201cI didn\u2019t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated.\u201d But there is plenty of evidence, including from a government report, that families had been separated months before the official implementation of the policy in May 2018, and that families have continued to be separated since, all while the government has had difficulty reuniting children they had removed. On Monday night, moments before Trump spoke at the rally in Texas about his long-promised border wall, it was announced in Washington that parents are suing the government over family separations, claiming \u201cinexplicable cruelty\u201d over children being taken away. Back in El Paso, Yeimi explained that, like many other Hondurans, she was fleeing her country due to the levels of violence and limited work opportunities there. Also at the event at Annunciation House was \u00d3scar Vides, a native of El Salvador who had to flee home with his siblings after his parents were murdered there in 1988. He and his siblings were granted asylum and Vides graduated from the University of Texas at El Paso, became a US citizen and began a career at a pharmaceutical company. His siblings found work, variously, as a cook, a teacher and government workers, Vides said. \u201cWe are not the exception among refugees, we are the norm,\u201d Vides said. \u201cThe vast majority of people in the US have no idea what is like to live in a country that is violent and insecure. They have no idea what is like not being able to count on the police to protect you and to keep you safe.\u201d He said it deeply bothers him when Trump labels people as criminals who are simply in the same precarious situation he once was in. \u201cEvery time you are labeling them or using them for political gains, you\u2019re using me,\u201d he said.",

The freshly named country celebrated the event with a flag-raising ceremony marking its prospective \u2013 and long-awaited \u2013 accession to Nato. Under cloudy skies, the military alliance\u2019s distinctive flag was hoisted outside the main government building in Skopje, the former Yugoslav republic\u2019s capital. Addressing assembled dignitaries in front of the building where workers were poised to replace a Republic of Macedonia sign removed earlier in the week with the state\u2019s new name, prime minister Zoran Zaev luxuriated in the moment, saying a \u201chistoric goal\u201d had been achieved. \u201cLong live the Republic of North Macedonia,\u201d the social democrat leader tweeted. As a result of its new name, North Macedonia could finally join Nato \u2013 a long-held dream for the small, multi-ethnic country which only narrowly escaped civil war in 2001. Athens had blocked Skopje\u2019s membership of the alliance arguing its northern neighbour\u2019s use of the name without geographic qualification amounted to theft of its own history, identity and cultural heritage. The Greek province of Macedonia, abutting the tiny republic, has long been associated with Alexander the Great, the most famous Macedonian of all. Successive Greek governments had insisted the landlocked state\u2019s determination to be known as Macedonia implied territorial ambitions against the Greek region. Under the landmark pact struck last year between Zaev and his leftwing counterpart in Athens, Alexis Tsipras, Greek MPs became the first Nato member parliament on Friday to pass a protocol agreement paving the way to North Macedonia\u2019s entry into the alliance. The strategic Balkan state will become Nato\u2019s 30th member once ratified by other signatories \u2013 a prospect slammed by Russia which regards the Balkans as a traditional sphere of influence. In a last move that effectively crossed the rubicon, the Greek government sent a diplomatic note late on Wednesday informing Skopje that, with passage of the historic accord and Nato protocol, it had officially fulfilled its side of the deal. With the United Nations poised to be informed of the name change, Macedonian authorities will have five years to alter the country\u2019s name both domestically and internationally but, as in Greece where the compromise accord ignited fierce protests, opposition has been intense. \u201cEverything from official documents to passports will be changed,\u201d said Athens\u2019 deputy foreign minister, George Katrougalos, noting that over 1,000 signs with the republic\u2019s new name had been ordered. One of the first appellations to be altered will be at the border crossing North Macedonia shares with its neighbour to the south. \u201cThere will be changes on our side, too, but nothing like the challenge faced by them,\u201d the Greek foreign ministry\u2019s spokesman, Alexandros Yennimatas, told the Guardian. \u201cA circular has been sent to [our] public and local administration informing them to adopt the new name.\u201d Implementation will not be easy.

      "bodyText": "When Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n is sentenced on 25 June, he will most likely be sent to US maximum-security prison from which there will be no more tunnels and no more escapes. Guzm\u00e1n was convicted on all 10 charges after years of painstaking behind-the-scenes work by US Department of Justice prosecutors who cut deals with captive drug traffickers to get their man. The driving theme of the trial was that \u2013 unlike Italian godfathers of yore \u2013 the Mexican and Colombian cartels which nowadays shift most of the world\u2019s drugs do not honour the old mafia dictum of omert\u00e0, the bond of silence. The courthouse where Guzm\u00e1n was convicted \u2013 New York\u2019s eastern district \u2013 was the setting for the 1992 trial of John Gotti, head of the Sicilian Gambino clan. His conviction marked the end of Cosa Nostra\u2019s reign in New York \u2013 and, indirectly, the rise of the Latin American syndicates which replaced them. That same year, saw the culmination of Italy\u2019s five-year mafia \u201cmaxi-trial\u201d in Palermo. Prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino secured convictions against 360 operatives. Both paid with their lives, but the Sicilian mafia was mortally wounded. It took one snitch \u2013 Sammy \u201cthe Bull\u201d Gravano \u2013 to nail Gotti. The mafia kingpins \u2013 Bernardo Provenzano and Salvatore Riina \u2013 were brought down by two \u201cpenitent\u201d witnesses. By contrast, Mexican and Colombian mobsters have lined up to squeal against Guzm\u00e1n: 16 testified at this trial, and the prosecution had more to choose from. First up was Jes\u00fas Zambada Garc\u00eda, the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s former accountant, who spoke of investors, overheads and profit margins as though he were selling hamburgers, not cocaine and methamphetamines. Then, in quick succession, came Miguel \u00c1ngel Mart\u00ednez, who said he had \u201cthe best time in the world\u201d as Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lieutenant; naturalised American citizen Edgar Galv\u00e1n, who described Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s torture chamber of horrors; and Juan Carlos Ram\u00edrez, alias \u201cLollipop\u201d, who laid out a manual for the routine corruption of national governments. Institutional corruption became a second major theme of the trial, which at times became a litigation of Mexico\u2019s politics, army and police \u2013 despite the efforts of the prosecution and judge. Witnesses described bribes to the drug tsar who was supposed to be fighting Guzm\u00e1n; federal and highway police who escorted consignments of Colombian cocaine; an army general on the payroll in return for safe passage, and Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s worries that a police commander was not receiving his monthly cheque. There were allegations of bribes to former Mexican presidents Felipe Calder\u00f3n and Enrique Pe\u00f1o Nieto (denied by both) , and allegations of bribes to a senior aide of the current president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. Defence lawyers tried to make such allegations the focus of the trial instead of the allegations against Guzm\u00e1n; the jury didn\u2019t buy it. And what the trial successfully did \u2013 to the repeated outrage of Mexican journalists covering the trial \u2013 was bury the money trail. Throughout the evidence, cash was always described as going \u201cback in Mexico\u201d. Mart\u00ednez flew planes loaded with between $8m and $10m from Tijuana three times a month. Cash deposits were hidden beneath beds and even underwater. Mart\u00ednez described hauling a Samsonite case filled with $10m to \u201ca Mexico City bank\u201d every month \u2013 but he was never asked which one, not by prosecution, defence or bench. The trial lasted three months without mentioning Wachovia, HSBC or other banks who have admitted bringing the billions Zambada Garc\u00eda described \u201cback to America\u201d for dissemination throughout the \u201clegal\u201d economy. The guilty verdict means no more tunnels for El Chapo, but as the door slams behind him, it may well mean sighs of relief around US boardrooms.",

I\u2019ve got a wealth of talent,\u201d said Nigel Twiston-Davies when asked about his nine entries for this year\u2019s Grand National at the unveiling of the weights on Tuesday. The Gloucestershire trainer had his tongue at least partly in his cheek but his Ballyoptic is very nicely positioned on 10st 11lbs and looks the best long-range pick of the 110 possible runners at odds of 33-1.</p> \n<p>Stamina is everything in the famous Aintree contest since the fences were softened and Ballyoptic\u2019s credentials can\u2019t be doubted in light of his powerful finish in last year\u2019s Scottish Grand National. Alas for all concerned, he came up short by about an inch, carrying a stone more than the winner, Joe Farrell. The National\u2019s extra emphasis on stamina can help him go one place better on 6 April.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/12/equine-flu-outbreak-racing-festivals-to-face-strict-risk-management\">'It's a complete shambles': trainers rail at new protocols after flu outbreak</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The obvious risk is his jumping and no one could be blamed for fretting over his fall when first tried over these fences in December\u2019s Becher Chase. But that was only the seventh steeplechase of his career and he can learn from it. He was moving nicely into contention at the time. Interestingly, Twiston-Davies is in a position to ensure that Ballyoptic stays on that tempting mark of 10-11, since he also fields the top-weight, <br>Bristol De Mai, and sounds keen to run the grey if he is ready to go again after the Cheltenham Gold Cup next month.</p> \n<p>The handicapper has offered him every incentive to run, having given Bristol De Mai a 5lb lower rating than he should have, under the now-familiar policy of compressing the top of the National weights. \u201cThat\u2019s concentrated our minds on going for it,\u201d Twiston-Davies said.</p> \n<p>Martin Greenwood got off to a flier in his first year setting the National weights, with no especially forceful complaints from connections. Eddie O\u2019Leary, racing manager for Ireland\u2019s powerful Gigginstown operation, was sometimes unhappy with the work of Greenwood\u2019s predecessor, Phil Smith, but sounded entirely content with the weights given to his horses this time, including last year\u2019s winner, Tiger Roll, who will shoulder just 11st 1lb if Bristol De Mai takes part.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4b043153-a96c-4e93-b751-8041cb81dcdc\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>11-10</b> Bristol De Mai<br><b>11-6</b> Anibale Fly<br><b>11-4</b> Elegant Escape, Alpha Des Obeaux<br><b>11-3</b> The Storyteller<br><b>11-2</b> Valtor<br><b>11-1</b> Edwulf, Tiger Roll<br><b>11-0</b> Outlander<br><b>10-13</b> Don Poli, Go Conquer, Sub Lieutenant<br><b>10-12</b> Blaklion, Mala Beach, Yala Enki<br><b>10-11</b> Ballyoptic, Black Corton, Lake View Lad, Minella Rocco, Pleasant Company<br><b>10-10</b> American, Dounikos, One For Arthur, Rathvinden, Shattered Love, Sizing Codelco, Total Recall, Traffic Fluide<br><b>10-9</b> Rock The Kasbah, Warrior's Tale<br><b>10-8</b> Auvergnat, Regal Encore, Royal Vacation<br><b>10-7</b> A Toi Phil, Jury Duty, Magic Of Light, Master Dee<br><b>10-6</b> Monbeg Notorious, Noble Endeavour, Sandymount Duke, The Last Samuri<br><b>10-5</b> Acapella Bourgeois, Ramses De Teillee, Tea For Two<br><b>10-4</b> Daklondike, Mall Dini<br><b>10-3</b> Callett Mad, Step Back, The Dutchman, Ultragold<br><b>10-2</b> Blow By Blow, Ms Parfois, Pairofbrowneyes, Singlefarmpayment, Some Neck, Up For Review, Valseur Lido, Vieux Lion Rouge<br><b>10-1</b> Abolitionist, Give Me A Copper, Missed Approach<br><b>10-0</b> Folsom Blue, General Principle, Livelovelaugh, Vintage Clouds, Walk In The Mill, Willie Boy<br><b>9-13</b> Ballyhill, Bless The Wings, Captain Redbeard, Polidam<br><b>9-12</b> Allysson Monterg, Baie Des Iles, Exitas, Isleofhopendreams, Joe Farrell, Just A Par, Red Infantry, Shantou Village, The Young Master<br><b>9-11</b> Westerner Point<br><b>9-10</b> Ballyarthur, Ballydine, Cogry, Fact Of The Matter, Out Sam, Vieux Morvan<br><b>9-9</b> Impulsive Star, Kingswell Theatre, Mr Diablo<br><b>9-8</b> Carole's Destrier, Milansbar<br><b>9-7</b> Borice, Jarob, Measureofmydreams, Rogue Angel, Splash Of Ginge, Ziga Boy<br><b>9-5</b> Call It Magic, Highland Lodge, Kilcrea Vale, Woods Well<br><b>9-3</b> Looking Well<br><b>9-2</b> Back To The Thatch, Potters Corner<br><b>8-13</b> Morney Wing<br><b>8-12</b> Ned Stark, Rathlin Rose<br><b>8-11</b> Scoir Mear, Van Gogh Du Granit <br>\u2022 Skipthecuddles and Lieutenant Colonel not qualified</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The only contretemps came when Sir Anthony McCoy made clear his feelings that Auvergnat had been harshly treated on 10st 8lbs, representing a hike of a stone and a half for his Leopardstown win at Christmas.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI\u2019m so lucky! I\u2019ve got a wealth of talent,\u201d said Nigel Twiston-Davies when asked about his nine entries for this year\u2019s Grand National at the unveiling of the weights on Tuesday. The Gloucestershire trainer had his tongue at least partly in his cheek but his Ballyoptic is very nicely positioned on 10st 11lbs and looks the best long-range pick of the 110 possible runners at odds of 33-1. Stamina is everything in the famous Aintree contest since the fences were softened and Ballyoptic\u2019s credentials can\u2019t be doubted in light of his powerful finish in last year\u2019s Scottish Grand National. Alas for all concerned, he came up short by about an inch, carrying a stone more than the winner, Joe Farrell. The National\u2019s extra emphasis on stamina can help him go one place better on 6 April. The obvious risk is his jumping and no one could be blamed for fretting over his fall when first tried over these fences in December\u2019s Becher Chase. But that was only the seventh steeplechase of his career and he can learn from it. He was moving nicely into contention at the time. Interestingly, Twiston-Davies is in a position to ensure that Ballyoptic stays on that tempting mark of 10-11, since he also fields the top-weight, Bristol De Mai, and sounds keen to run the grey if he is ready to go again after the Cheltenham Gold Cup next month. The handicapper has offered him every incentive to run, having given Bristol De Mai a 5lb lower rating than he should have, under the now-familiar policy of compressing the top of the National weights. \u201cThat\u2019s concentrated our minds on going for it,\u201d Twiston-Davies said. Martin Greenwood got off to a flier in his first year setting the National weights, with no especially forceful complaints from connections. Eddie O\u2019Leary, racing manager for Ireland\u2019s powerful Gigginstown operation, was sometimes unhappy with the work of Greenwood\u2019s predecessor, Phil Smith, but sounded entirely content with the weights given to his horses this time, including last year\u2019s winner, Tiger Roll, who will shoulder just 11st 1lb if Bristol De Mai takes part. The only contretemps came when Sir Anthony McCoy made clear his feelings that Auvergnat had been harshly treated on 10st 8lbs, representing a hike of a stone and a half for his Leopardstown win at Christmas. Greenwood noted the horse had some classy cross-country form. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t a cross-country race,\u201d McCoy countered. Held in Liverpool for the first time, this weights launch was a success after a couple of difficult years when late-night London venues proved unsuitable, through poor acoustics or failing power. The only tricky moment came when a speaker gave \u201cfull marks to the BHA\u201d for resuming racing on Wednesday. Frustrated by the controversial new vaccination rule, a good number of those present evidently did not share that sentiment.",

The radical Labour government we all want will not be able to do much if we are poorer and cut off from our main trading partner. We are confident that when every Brexit option has been exhausted, we will be able to move to the next stage of our conference policy by campaigning for a new public vote. Margaret Beckett MP Derby South, Chris Bryant MP Rhondda, Anne Clwyd MP Cynon Valley, Mary Creagh MP Wakefield, Susan Ellen Jones MP Clwyd South, Julie Elliot MP Sunderland Central, Margaret Hodge MP Barking, Jess Phillips MP Birmingham Yardley, Bridget Phillipson MP Houghton and Sunderland South, Rachel Reeves MP Leeds West, Gavin Shuker MP Luton South, Wes Streeting MP Ilford North, Anna Turley MP Redcar, Paul Williams MP Stockton South, Phil Wilson MP Sedgefield \u2022 With regard to the letters attacking Caroline Flint for opposing a second referendum (8 February), I was in a cafe at the weekend surrounded by fellow older women, all remainers living in a remain constituency, and I was proper surprised to find that not one wanted a referendum; from what I gathered they supported Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s plan. I then asked a young friend who had openly wept after the first referendum, and she too did not wish for a second vote and she does support Corbyn\u2019s plan. None wanted the first referendum and all feared dire outcomes of a second. Unless parliament takes control, it won\u2019t be Labour or Lib Dems or the SNP setting the choices but May. Nigel Farage is now planning his next \u201cpower to the people\u201d-type campaign. It is an utter mess, not helped by wishful thinking. Ruth Overy Leeds \u2022 With the planet on course to possibly be uninhabitable in 100 years (This is not a drill, Weekend, 2 February), this puts the whole Brexit debate, especially the backstop, in perspective. It reminds me of the story about when the Turks were storming the walls of Constantinople while the Orthodox clergy were debating how many angels would fit on the head of a pin. It just shows what happens when you let the fanatics take over.

The consensus around Salvini reminds me of the one around Mussolini.\u201d Salvini, who knows Montalbano is one of the most loved Italian characters, appears to have opted not to pick a fight. \u201cI love Montalbano,\u201d he tweeted on Monday night. Montalbano is the first Italian series sold abroad successfully, and has been broadcast in more than 65 countries including the US and Iran.",

Last week, Bezos published emails from the National Enquirer which threatened to publish seminude photos of the billionaire if he didn\u2019t publicly state that there were no political motivations his unflattering coverage in the tabloid. Bezos titled his blog post \u201cNo thank you, Mr Pecker,\u201d which is also \u201cexactly how I feel about seeing Jeff Bezos\u2019s penis\u201d, joked Colbert.</p> <p>Bezos said he committed whatever budget necessary to find how the intimate text messages got in the hands of the National Enquirer. The investigation has brought up some familiar names: Michael Sanchez, brother of Bezos\u2019s girlfriend, is a close friend of disgraced Trump associate and over-dresser Roger Stone. \u201cCome on, would Roger Stone really stoop to a phone hack or blackmail?\u201d Colbert commented. \u201cThat would take away valuable time he could spend bulldozing a dog orphanage in a Disney movie.\u201d</p> <p>Bezos believes the blackmail was political, calling his ownership of the Washington Post a situational \u201ccomplexifier\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think Jeff Bezos just redefinified a brandastical new wordity,\u201d said Colbert. Good news, Colbert said, because after \u201cmanhood\u201d and \u201csexts\u201d, \u201cI think the best euphemism for penis is \u2018complexifier\u2019.\u201d<br></p>",

So you might as well have a white guy who has already been caught and feels bad about it \u2013 because you know that guy is never messing up again \u2013 and now he has a racism debt that he has to pay off.\u201d White guilt could be \u201cvery useful,\u201d Noah said \u2013 possible leverage for better schools, criminal justice reform or a holiday on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s birthday. Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers turned to the 2020 campaign trail, where a historic number of women \u2013 six \u2013 have entered the race. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota announced her bid in a snow-covered rally this weekend \u2013 weather that Trump confused, of course, with evidence refuting climate change. \u201cWhy do we have to keep explaining to the president of the United States that weather and climate are two different things?\u201d Meyers asked. \u201cWe live in a country where science teachers have to tell their students, \u2018I don\u2019t care what the president said.\u2019\u201d Trump also lashed out at Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Twitter this weekend; in a tweet, he referenced her specious history of claiming Native American heritage and said he would see her \u201con the campaign TRAIL\u201d \u2013 seemingly a reference to the Trail of Tears, the forced removal and genocide of thousands of Cherokees under President Andrew Jackson in the 1830s. Many called foul on the tweet, though some prominent conservatives claimed it couldn\u2019t be a racist reference because, well, Trump doesn\u2019t know about the Trail of Tears. \u201cThey\u2019re actually defending Trump by saying he\u2019s too dumb to be racist,\u201d Meyers said, exasperated. He wasn\u2019t buying it, either. \u201cIf you ever find yourself asking is Trump dumb or is he racist, the answer is most likely C, all of the above.\u201d Stephen Colbert On the Late Show, Colbert focused on the very public smackdown between National Enquirer CEO and Trump ally David Pecker and \u201cworld\u2019s wealthiest cage-free egg\u201d, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Last week, Bezos published emails from the National Enquirer which threatened to publish seminude photos of the billionaire if he didn\u2019t publicly state that there were no political motivations his unflattering coverage in the tabloid. Bezos titled his blog post \u201cNo thank you, Mr Pecker,\u201d which is also \u201cexactly how I feel about seeing Jeff Bezos\u2019s penis\u201d, joked Colbert. Bezos said he committed whatever budget necessary to find how the intimate text messages got in the hands of the National Enquirer. The investigation has brought up some familiar names: Michael Sanchez, brother of Bezos\u2019s girlfriend, is a close friend of disgraced Trump associate and over-dresser Roger Stone. \u201cCome on, would Roger Stone really stoop to a phone hack or blackmail?\u201d Colbert commented. \u201cThat would take away valuable time he could spend bulldozing a dog orphanage in a Disney movie.\u201d Bezos believes the blackmail was political, calling his ownership of the Washington Post a situational \u201ccomplexifier\u201d. \u201cI think Jeff Bezos just redefinified a brandastical new wordity,\u201d said Colbert. Good news, Colbert said, because after \u201cmanhood\u201d and \u201csexts\u201d, \u201cI think the best euphemism for penis is \u2018complexifier\u2019.\u201d",

Gleefully, they rushed to let him know that the vagina is the muscular tube that connects the vaginal opening to the cervix \u2013 whereas the vulva is the external genitalia, including the labia, the clitoris and the vaginal and urethral openings. It is then that a more sensible man might have logged off or even deleted his tweet, but Paul Bullen didn\u2019t give up. In fact, he got into a separate argument about the definition of \u201cmansplaining\u201d and then doubled down on his vagina/vulva assertion.</p> <p>\u201cI am supporting widespread female usage, as in <a href=\"https://www.eveensler.org/plays/the-vagina-monologues/\" title=\"\">The Vagina Monologues</a>,\u201d he argued. \u201cI am defending how actual people speak.\u201d</p> <p>It is here, I must concede, that Bullen has a point. The word vagina is regularly misused. In fact, until I wrote a book about vaginas and vulvas, I called my own vulva a vagina. I knew that I was supposed to call it a vulva but I thought that the word \u201cvulva\u201d sounded a bit stuffy, a bit pedantic. Given the dearth of words women have to describe their genitals (\u201cpussy\u201d is too porny; \u201ccunt\u201d is too sweary; \u201cfront bottom\u201d is just ridiculous), most of us have relied on \u201cvagina\u201d, even if it isn\u2019t anatomically correct.</p> <p>However, when I began to write extensively about female health and sexuality, I realised that by not using the word vulva, I was doing myself and my genitals a disservice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/09/me-and-my-vulva-100-women-reveal-all-photographs\">Me and my vulva: 100 women reveal all</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The American feminist and psychologist <a href=\"https://www.harrietlerner.com/\" title=\"\">Harriet Lerner</a> believes that neglecting the word vulva has serious consequences, calling it a \u201cpsychic genital mutilation\u201d. \u201cWhat is not named does not exist,\u201d she argues. The vagina is essential for heterosexual penis-in-vagina sex and childbirth and so the word has come to be tolerated if not exactly celebrated. The vulva \u2013 with its clitoris \u2013 represents something more taboo than even sex and menstruation: female pleasure. It is a place of independent female sexuality, a place that can exist \u2013 happily \u2013 unperturbed by a penis. And so the vulva has been sidelined.</p> <p>Suddenly, though, more and more of us are keen to say, see and celebrate vulvas. As well as Dodsworth\u2019s project, there\u2019s a book forthcoming from <a href=\"https://www.thevulvagallery.com/\" title=\"\">The Vulva Gallery</a>, a website and Instagram account featuring hundreds of illustrated vulvas by the Dutch artist Hilde Atalanta. Both Dodsworth and Atalanta have spoken about how an ignorance of basic biology has serious ramifications for people \u2013 in terms of pleasure, confidence and gender equality. And as women recognise the lack of information they\u2019ve been given about their own bodies and the consequences that has had \u2013 particularly in the wake of the #MeToo movement \u2013 there is an increased focus on our biology and the language we use to describe it.</p> <p>Using the words vulva and vagina interchangeably isn\u2019t a harmless linguistic quirk: it\u2019s actually a technique for diminishing a woman\u2019s sexual agency. Anyone who cares about language \u2013 and women \u2013 should recognise that.</p> <p>\u2022 Lynn Enright is a journalist and the author of Vagina: A Re-education, published in March 2019</p>",

In fact, he got into a separate argument about the definition of \u201cmansplaining\u201d and then doubled down on his vagina/vulva assertion. \u201cI am supporting widespread female usage, as in The Vagina Monologues,\u201d he argued. \u201cI am defending how actual people speak.\u201d It is here, I must concede, that Bullen has a point. The word vagina is regularly misused. In fact, until I wrote a book about vaginas and vulvas, I called my own vulva a vagina. I knew that I was supposed to call it a vulva but I thought that the word \u201cvulva\u201d sounded a bit stuffy, a bit pedantic. Given the dearth of words women have to describe their genitals (\u201cpussy\u201d is too porny; \u201ccunt\u201d is too sweary; \u201cfront bottom\u201d is just ridiculous), most of us have relied on \u201cvagina\u201d, even if it isn\u2019t anatomically correct. However, when I began to write extensively about female health and sexuality, I realised that by not using the word vulva, I was doing myself and my genitals a disservice. The American feminist and psychologist Harriet Lerner believes that neglecting the word vulva has serious consequences, calling it a \u201cpsychic genital mutilation\u201d. \u201cWhat is not named does not exist,\u201d she argues. The vagina is essential for heterosexual penis-in-vagina sex and childbirth and so the word has come to be tolerated if not exactly celebrated. The vulva \u2013 with its clitoris \u2013 represents something more taboo than even sex and menstruation: female pleasure. It is a place of independent female sexuality, a place that can exist \u2013 happily \u2013 unperturbed by a penis. And so the vulva has been sidelined. Suddenly, though, more and more of us are keen to say, see and celebrate vulvas. As well as Dodsworth\u2019s project, there\u2019s a book forthcoming from The Vulva Gallery, a website and Instagram account featuring hundreds of illustrated vulvas by the Dutch artist Hilde Atalanta. Both Dodsworth and Atalanta have spoken about how an ignorance of basic biology has serious ramifications for people \u2013 in terms of pleasure, confidence and gender equality. And as women recognise the lack of information they\u2019ve been given about their own bodies and the consequences that has had \u2013 particularly in the wake of the #MeToo movement \u2013 there is an increased focus on our biology and the language we use to describe it. Using the words vulva and vagina interchangeably isn\u2019t a harmless linguistic quirk: it\u2019s actually a technique for diminishing a woman\u2019s sexual agency. Anyone who cares about language \u2013 and women \u2013 should recognise that. \u2022 Lynn Enright is a journalist and the author of Vagina: A Re-education, published in March 2019",

Reading from his pocket notebook, he said Broughton told him the pair went to the woods and were chilling.</p> <p>Thompson continued: \u201cHe said she had a bad trip and was going mental. He said it was down to a drug he said was 2C-B [sic]. There was a point where he had to restrain and calm her. He goes on to say he called [Fletcher-Michie\u2019s] mother.</p> <p>\u201cI tried to get him to explain why they had gone into the woods. He just explained they were people of nature. I tried to get him to elaborate about the female going mental. He explained she was trying to eat twigs and trees. She was shouting \u2018Call my mum, I have had enough of this shit\u2019. Again, I tried to get him to elaborate. He believed there might be some family issues.</p> <p>\u201cHe goes on to explain she was scraping thorns across her face. He said it lasted between 30 minutes and an hour. He said he had not seen her react this way to drugs previously. He said after buying the drug, they both went into the woods.\u201d</p> <p>Winchester crown court has heard John Michie and his wife, Carol Fletcher-Michie, drove 130 miles to the festival site from their home in London after hearing their daughter \u201cscreeching\u201d on the phone.</p> <p>Thompson said he was with Broughton when he spotted Carol Fletcher-Michie. \u201cThe mother was shouting something at him and he was shouting back, \u2018I kept looking for her\u2019,\u201d the officer said.</p> <p>A log kept by one of the event\u2019s managers, Andrew McGrory, was also read to the jury. McGrory noted he met Broughton at 12.35am on 11 September 2017.</p> <p>\u201cHe was dazed and vacant, and appeared to be under the influence, but not really agitated,\u201d the log read.</p> <p>\u201cI asked where he had last seen his girlfriend and he said in the woods. I asked what they were doing and got no response. Then he volunteered she was not well.</p> <p>\u201cI asked him if she was OK and got no response. I asked if she was breathing; he said yes. He said she was cold and he had given her his coat.</p> <p>\u201cI said \u2018Cut to the chase\u2019 and asked had they taken drugs. He said they had taken 2C-P.

He told a police officer that during a \u201cbad trip\u201d, she was shouting \u201cCall my mum\u201d, but claimed he believed she was saying this because of \u201cfamily issues\u201d. The prosecution alleges Broughton did not immediately seek help for Fletcher-Michie, the 24-year-old daughter of the Holby City actor John Michie, because he feared he would be in trouble. Broughton, 29, of Enfield, north London, denies manslaughter and supplying the class A drug 2C-P. PC David Thompson spoke to Broughton at 1.36am on 11 September 2017 after Fletcher-Michie\u2019s body was found. Reading from his pocket notebook, he said Broughton told him the pair went to the woods and were chilling. Thompson continued: \u201cHe said she had a bad trip and was going mental. He said it was down to a drug he said was 2C-B [sic]. There was a point where he had to restrain and calm her. He goes on to say he called [Fletcher-Michie\u2019s] mother. \u201cI tried to get him to explain why they had gone into the woods. He just explained they were people of nature. I tried to get him to elaborate about the female going mental. He explained she was trying to eat twigs and trees. She was shouting \u2018Call my mum, I have had enough of this shit\u2019. Again, I tried to get him to elaborate. He believed there might be some family issues. \u201cHe goes on to explain she was scraping thorns across her face. He said it lasted between 30 minutes and an hour. He said he had not seen her react this way to drugs previously. He said after buying the drug, they both went into the woods.\u201d Winchester crown court has heard John Michie and his wife, Carol Fletcher-Michie, drove 130 miles to the festival site from their home in London after hearing their daughter \u201cscreeching\u201d on the phone. Thompson said he was with Broughton when he spotted Carol Fletcher-Michie. \u201cThe mother was shouting something at him and he was shouting back, \u2018I kept looking for her\u2019,\u201d the officer said. A log kept by one of the event\u2019s managers, Andrew McGrory, was also read to the jury. McGrory noted he met Broughton at 12.35am on 11 September 2017. \u201cHe was dazed and vacant, and appeared to be under the influence, but not really agitated,\u201d the log read. \u201cI asked where he had last seen his girlfriend and he said in the woods. I asked what they were doing and got no response. Then he volunteered she was not well. \u201cI asked him if she was OK and got no response. I asked if she was breathing; he said yes. He said she was cold and he had given her his coat. \u201cI said \u2018Cut to the chase\u2019 and asked had they taken drugs. He said they had taken 2C-P. I realised this could be much worse than a missing girl.\u201d The trial continues.",

Past players, current players, international captains, coaches, sports journalists, human rights advocates, politicians, podcasters, bloggers, community clubs: the \u201cglobal football family\u201d; mobilised behind a hashtag of #SaveHakeem. In January, Foster travelled to Switzerland to personally lobby Fifa secretary general Fatma Samoura on behalf of Al-Araibi, who had been an international player for Bahrain before fleeing to Australia and being convicted in absentia on a widely discredited vandalism charge. Fifa sent a representative to Al-Araibi\u2019s court hearing last week, and joined the International Olympic Committee and the United Nations high commissioner for refugees in urging Thailand to allow Al-Araibi to return to Australia. By the time Al-Araibi\u2019s release was secured on Monday night, the nominations were in. Foster should be Australian of the year. He could probably even be prime minister, if he wanted. Foster himself has downplayed his role, saying that he was just a high-profile figure, not the driving force. \u201cThere was a huge coalition of people right around the world ... It was a really amazing effort,\u201d he told ABC radio on Tuesday. Among those singing his praises are the prime minister, Scott Morrison, the foreign minister, Marise Payne, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, and the Labor frontbenchers Penny Wong and Mark Dreyfus. But Foster has already outlined another agenda. In an open letter on Tuesday he issued a warning to both the Australian government and the governing bodies of international sport that \u201cwe are just warming up\u201d. \u201cThis was a fight for the soul of sport and, whilst a blow has been struck, a great battle lies ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst step was to save Hakeem\u2019s life, the next is to hold the game accountable to its response or lack thereof, and to ensure all those in positions of governance that were willing to sacrifice the life of one player while occupying positions of influence and prestige, whether in football, the Olympic movement, or any other sport, are expunged.\u201d He also criticised Australia\u2019s record on asylum seekers, saying: \u201cAustralia must do better than we have in recent years.\u201d Foster was born in Lismore in northern New South Wales and moved to Sydney in the 1980s, making his debut at Sydney United in 1988. He played for the national team from 1996 to 2000 and has been a commentator for SBS since 2002, making him one of the most recognisable voices in Australian sport. In November he was the highest-profile candidate to take over as the chair of Football Federation Australia, but withdrew his nomination despite strong community support because he didn\u2019t have the backing of key stakeholders. That position was won by Chris Nikou. His success in organising the #SaveHakeem campaign has reopened public criticism of that decision. Foster says in his open letter that the Australian government should \u201ccommit to more humane policies for all the \u2018Hakeems\u2019 who come into Australia\u2019s care. Our nation has a big heart, we saw just how big in the past few months, and we need to carry this compassion forward.\u201d He says \u201cAustralia needs to look at how we treat every human being that comes to these shores, irrespective of how they arrive. I have committed to many throughout this campaign, including the UN, that I would work to this end when Hakeem was free and I intend to do so.\u201d",

Rhea Dempsey is a birth attendant and counsellor who consulted with Ivin and Coleman as Jo\u2019s character developed. She attributes growing rates of PND to an \u201cepidemic\u201d of social expectation on new mothers, who are isolated, physically and psychologically: \u201cWomen who are blaming themselves because they\u2019re not good enough or not the perfect mother are, in a way, individualising a social lack,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut we should always [look at] what the social support situation is.\u201d One of the greatest challenges for a new mother is the loneliness of it \u2013 and seeing the experience on screen can help with the burden of isolation. On top of that, shows like The Cry \u2013 which was the most-viewed program in its time slot in the UK last year \u2013 can also push awareness out to a wider audience. As Dempsey says: \u201cIt gives people permission to talk about it.\u201d Ivin says the success of the show\u2019s representation of PND comes down to its specificity. \u201cShe is such an extreme character in some ways, and yet everyone is identifying with her,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s when you get into the nitty-gritty that it works \u2013 dragging the big stroller up the staircase or staring out the window. She leaves a baby crying on the floor in another room.\u201d He pauses. \u201cWhen we were making it, I thought \u2013 that\u2019s an extreme example. And yet, many women understand it. Even if they haven\u2019t done exactly that, they think, \u2018I could have\u2019.\u201d Postnatal depression clangs; it is both wanting to get it exactly right, and feeling that will be impossible. It is a deep resentment and an inability to connect. It is the pressure to be a \u201cperfect\u201d mother without realising there is no such thing. \u201cThe Cry is engaging because it\u2019s a taut, gripping thriller,\u201d Ivin says, \u201cbut at the same time it does hold up a mirror to those of us in the room. We\u2019re seeing ourselves.\u201d \u2022 The Cry is streaming now on ABC iView",

      "bodyText": "Coles is launching a new collectible promotion of plastic toys on Wednesday, while the vestiges of the supermarket giant\u2019s last campaign are still having a negative impact on the environment. From this week, shoppers can collect one of 24 plastic fruit or vegetable toys for every $30 they spend in-store as part of the Coles Stikeez campaign. Endorsed by the Healthy Kids Association, the campaign is promoted as a way to encourage Australians to eat more fruit and vegetables and \u201cmake healthy eating fun for the whole family\u201d. It follows last year\u2019s Little Shop promotion, which had shoppers collecting 30 miniature, mostly plastic versions of well-known household items including mini bananas, household bleach and bottled water. Little Shop was considered a marketing success, helping to lift Coles sales by 5% in the first quarter of 2019. At the peak of the promotion, customers were selling complete sets online for up to $1,000, while \u201crare\u201d items like the mini red hand sold for $250. There was extensive criticism of the campaign at the time, particularly as it was launched after Coles banned plastic bags. The environmental engineer, Laura Trotta, described the campaign as an \u201cenvironmental nightmare\u201d. \u201cI think it really destroys their credibility in that sense. They are asking us to see them as responsible corporate citizens yet they just roll out heaps of cheap plastic products for free, and most of them end up in landfill.\u201d Customers quickly tired of the plastic toys. Distinctive Options, a not-for-profit disability support organisation that collected unwanted Little Shop toys to use as communication aids for individuals and programs, were inundated with toys. Chief executive Ernie Metcalf said they received \u201cthousands\u201d of toys not long after the promotion began. Only two months later they put up a post on Facebook asking supporters to stop sending them. The heady days of high-priced collectables changing hands online soon died down. These days complete sets are available for just $50. However, the promotion continues to have an environmental impact. According to Tangaroa Blue Foundation, the charity that collects data on beach cleanups, more than 35,000 items categorised as toys and other were collected in 2018, around 7,000 more than the previous year. Two Little Shop toys were picked up by Tangaroa Blue last year: one at Belmore Basin, Wollongong Harbour and a Little Shop miniature nappy packet toy was found at Port Campbell Bay. A spokesperson noted there could have been more as items could have been logged without descriptions. In November a miniature Little Shop Nutella toy was found on a Bali beach, by the Brisbane-based veterinarian Dr Stephanie Shaw. Although it was likely to have been transported by an Australian rather than washed up on the beach, Shaw told Caters News that the toy could be deadly if swallowed by a turtle or sea bird. Environmental groups have slammed the latest promotion. Jayne Paramor, the deputy director of environmental waste campaigners Boomerang Alliance, said Coles hadn\u2019t learnt from the Little Shop criticism. \u201c[Coles] have again placed profits ahead of sustainability, using these so-called \u2018collectables\u2019 to bring consumers into their stores, with no regard for the environmental impact that this plastic tat will have as it heads for landfill. \u201cThe fact that they have moved on to a new promotion just six months after the Little Shop was launched shows the lack of longevity that these promotions really have.

      "bodyText": "Sahar* does not have the energy for optimism. The Iranian refugee is one of a large number of refugees and asylum seekers in immigration detention on Nauru who will be eligible for medical transfer to Australia after legislation that passed the House on Tuesday also passed the Senate on Wednesday morning. She has severe anxiety stemming from a dog attack and what she describes as persistent sexual harassment in Nauru, as well as painful degrading enamel on her teeth, a condition that earned her a medical referral to Australia from Nauru\u2019s senior dental officer for enamel veneers, which are not available in the tiny Pacific nation. But even though the legislation has passed, the 34-year-old says, it will not make a difference. To provide proper healthcare would mean that Australia would have to care about asylum seekers, and from Sahar\u2019s perspective they stopped caring a long time ago. \u201cI can\u2019t trust the politicians nor the doctors,\u201d she says. \u201cFor six years, I witness how doctors collaborated with politicians to ruin us here. Even if the bill passes, they would not transfer us until they find us dying. The aim of the policy is to obliterate us.\u201d In Canberra, debate has coalesced on what a defeat on this issue means for the Morrison government and the timing of the federal election, and what supporting the medical transfer bill would mean for Labor\u2019s electoral chances. But from this distance, 3,340km off the coast from Brisbane, the debate is not political but existential. Hajar, a 33-year-old Iranian asylum seeker, is on Nauru with her ailing parents while her brother lives in Australia. Her mother, aged 56, attempted suicide in December; her father is confined to a sling because he requires elbow surgery. He rejected the Australian government\u2019s offer to have the surgery performed in Taiwan, where he has no support network. Hajar says the Australian Border Force (ABF) is \u201caiming to tear our family apart\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m gonna throw myself in the ocean,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t look after my depressed and ill parents anymore. Now that the bill has passed, \u201cmany severely sick and defenceless humans will be rescued from ongoing torture\u201d. Bita*, a 30-year-old Iranian refugee, has also been on Nauru for six years. Her capacity for hope has been ground down. \u201cMy six-year experience of endurance with the Australian refugee policies doesn\u2019t allow me to be optimistic about this bill,\u201d she tells Guardian Australia. \u201cNauru is equal to hopelessness. I can\u2019t see any gleam of hope that would heal us.\u201d Bita suffers from severe back pain and now uses a wheelchair. She has been waiting for a month to see an orthopaedic surgeon and also requires an MRI, which she has been told she cannot get in Nauru. She wrote to the ABF twice seeking medical treatment and asking to be resettled in New Zealand and received a letter back in January advising her that the government of Nauru and the Australian-funded International Health and Medical Services, which services the regional processing centre, are responsible for her healthcare. \u201cWe all came out here with good health and standing on our two feet however most of us now are on wheelchair,\u201d she says. \u201cFor so many years, my depression and pain have been ignored and untreated that I am not sure that I will ever recover from them anywhere else.\u201d *Some names have been changed.

It\u2019s a beseeching expression conveying concern, a little trepidation and grim resolve. I know what\u2019s coming. \u201cAdrian,\u201d he says. \u201cI really think you need to go on Twitter.\u201d I don\u2019t blame him for asking. A Twitterless presenter is an awful thing for any production team to be saddled with. It must feel like having to go back to recording stuff on quarter-inch tape, to be spliced up and run on an old ReVox. I thank them for their forbearance. I don\u2019t take this stance on principle, and I\u2019m certainly not proud of it. Call it cowardice, call it stubbornness, call it stupidity, naivety or whatever you like. I plead guilty on every count. It\u2019s career suicide, apart from anything else. If a programme-maker can get a presenter with 100,000 followers on board, or me with none, who are they going to plump for? But I just can\u2019t bring myself to tweet. It would feel like opening up the gates of hell. Why would I do that? I\u2019m led to believe there\u2019s dreadful personal abuse out there. In my time, I\u2019ve had a fair amount directed at me. Back in the day, when I worked in football, I used to read in the newspapers how loathed I was on Twitter. So I was getting trolled without even being on it? That felt like quite a thing. At the World Cup in Rio, I worried that things were getting so bad it might be upsetting my teenage daughters back home.

The prime minister met Labour MPs including John Mann, Caroline Flint and Gareth Snell in her House of Commons office on Monday night, where some of the MPs present said an amendment to the trade bill or any other legislation \u201cwould not cut the mustard\u201d. Neither Flint nor Snell backed her deal in the previous vote in early January, though Mann voted with the government. On Tuesday, May told the House of Commons after the meeting that she was prepared to consider legislating to ensure her commitments on workers\u2019 rights had legal force \u2013 though it stopped short of a commitment to a standalone bill. MPs have said the guarantees should include a \u201cregression lock\u201d to ensure UK standards did not slip below those of the EU as well as opportunities for MPs to vote on raising UK standards when future EU laws are implemented. Speaking to MPs, May said that was actively being considered. \u201cIn the interests of building support across the house, we are also prepared to commit to asking parliament whether it wishes to follow suit whenever the EU changes its standards in these areas,\u201d she said. MPs are also believed to have urged the prime minister to continue discussions with trade unions, particularly those representing manufacturing industries such as Unite and GMB. In her statement on Tuesday, May suggested she was preparing to offer other concessions demanded by union leaders, including Unite\u2019s Len McCluskey, on rules governing agency workers. May said the government had plans to repeal the so-called Swedish derogation, which allows employers to pay their agency workers less. \u201cWe are committed to enforcing holiday pay for the most vulnerable workers,\u201d she said. \u201cNot just protecting workers\u2019 rights, but extending them.\u201d Unions are also understood to have demanded other legal changes from the prime minister in return for their backing, including the right to conduct electronic workplace ballots rather than relying on postal voting. The business secretary, Greg Clark, told MPs at business questions earlier on Tuesday that he and the GMB general secretary, Tim Roache, had met to discuss those requests. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who has exchanged letters with May over the past week over ways the parties could find common ground, dismissed any suggestion of trusting the Conservatives to legislate to protect workers\u2019 rights. \u201cFor many of them, ripping up rights is what Brexit is all about,\u201d he said, quoting the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, who said: \u201cIt is too difficult to hire and fire, and too expensive to take on new employees.

      "bodyText": "Some of the most senior clerics in the Roman Catholic church who have vociferously attacked homosexuality are themselves gay, according to a book to be published next week. Eighty per cent of priests working at the Vatican are gay, although not necessarily sexually active, it is claimed in the book, In the Closet of the Vatican. The 570-page book, which the French journalist and author Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martel spent four years researching, is a \u201cstartling account of corruption and hypocrisy at the heart of the Vatican\u201d, according to its British publisher Bloomsbury. It is being published in eight languages across 20 countries next Wednesday, coinciding with the opening day of a conference at the Vatican on sexual abuse, to which bishops from all over the world have been summoned. Martel, a former adviser to the French government, conducted 1,500 interviews while researching the book, including with 41 cardinals, 52 bishops and monsignors, 45 papal ambassadors or diplomatic officials, 11 Swiss guards and more than 200 priests and seminarians, according to a report on the Catholic website the Tablet. Many spoke of an unspoken code of the \u201ccloset\u201d, with one rule of thumb being that the more homophobic a cleric was, the more likely he was to be gay. Martel alleges that one Colombian cardinal, the late Alfonso L\u00f3pez Trujillo, who held a senior Vatican position, was an arch-defender of church teaching on homosexuality and contraception while using male prostitutes, the Tablet said. The author found that some gay priests accepted their sexuality and a few maintained discreet relationships, but others sought high-risk casual encounters. Some were in denial about their sexuality. Although the book does not conflate homosexuality with the sexual abuse of children, Martel describes a secretive culture among priests that creates conditions in which abuse is not confronted, say people familiar with the book\u2019s contents. According to Bloomsbury\u2019s promotional material, Inside the Closet \u201creveals secrets\u201d about celibacy, misogyny and plots against Pope Francis. It uncovers \u201ca clerical culture of secrecy which starts in junior seminaries and continues right up to the Vatican itself\u201d. Francis has riled his conservative critics in the Vatican over his apparently softer tone towards gay people. A few months into his papacy, he told reporters who asked about a \u201cgay lobby\u201d at the Vatican: \u201cIf a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\u201d Last year Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean survivor of sexual abuse, said Francis told him in a private meeting: \u201cJuan Carlos, that you are gay does not matter. God made you like this and loves you like this and I don\u2019t care. The pope loves you like this. You have to be happy with who you are.\u201d But a Polish priest who was sacked from his Vatican job and defrocked after announcing he was gay has accused the church of making the lives of millions of gay Catholics \u201ca hell\u201d. In a letter to Francis in 2015, Krzysztof Charamsa criticised what he called the Vatican\u2019s hypocrisy in banning gay priests and said the clergy was \u201cfull of homosexuals\u201d. In December, Francis was quoted in a book about vocations as saying homosexuality was a \u201cfashion\u201d to which the clergy was susceptible. \u201cThe issue of homosexuality is a very serious issue that must be adequately discerned from the beginning with the candidates [for the priesthood]. In our societies it even seems that homosexuality is fashionable and that mentality, in some way, also influences the life of the church,\u201d he said. The timing of Inside the Closet\u2019s publication, at the start of a milestone summit on sexual abuse, will raise concerns that some people may seek to conflate the two issues. But the book\u2019s allegations are likely to be pored over by senior bishops flying into Rome from more than 100 countries for the four-day summit.",

      "body": "<p>Izzy Young, who has died aged 90, was a key figure in the New York folk scene in the heady days of the 1950s and 60s, when he helped to launch the careers of several major musicians, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/15/bob-dylan-deserves-nobel-laureate-literature-singular-talent\" title=\"\">Bob Dylan</a>. Young became celebrated not as a performer but as an enthusiast, activist, writer and entrepreneur, always more eager to promote the music he loved than to make a profit. His shop Folklore Center in MacDougal Street, Greenwich Village, opened in 1957 and became a haven for fans and artists, who would stop here to meet, perform, or search for records, books and sheet music.</p> <p>Inevitably, Dylan dropped in soon after he moved from Minnesota to New York in 1961, and the most vivid description of Young\u2019s massively influential little empire can be found in Dylan\u2019s 2004 memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/16/highereducation.biography\" title=\"\">Chronicles Volume One</a>. Dylan calls the place \u201cthe citadel of Americana folk music \u2026 It was like an ancient chapel, like a shoebox sized institute. The Folklore Center sold and reported on everything that had to do with folk music\u201d.</p> <p>As for Young himself, Dylan noted that he \u201cwas an old-line folk enthusiast, very sardonic and wore heavy horn-rimmed glasses, spoke in a thick Brooklyn accent, wore wool slacks, skinny belt and work boots, tie at a careless slant. His voice was like a bulldozer and always seemed too loud for the little room \u2026 To him, folk music glittered like a mound of gold.\u201d</p> <p>Young kept diaries about events in the folk community, and these included his observations on Dylan, whom he quizzed about his early life and interest in folk music. He would pull out records for Dylan to listen to, and introduced him to other musicians, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/feb/13/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Dave Van Ronk</a>. Other visitors to the shop included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/pete-seeger\" title=\"\">Pete Seeger</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/allen-ginsberg\" title=\"\">Allen Ginsberg</a>, and that stalwart of the Greenwich Village music scene, <a href=\"http://www.happytraum.com/\" title=\"\">Happy Traum</a>.</p> <p>Traum told me: \u201cWe used the store as our home base, clubhouse, gossip mill and resource for books, magazines, strings, picks, capos and other paraphernalia of our folksinger\u2019s trade.\u201d He described Young as \u201ca kind of big brother \u2013 some would say father figure \u2013 who presided over his little domain like an autocrat of a small country. He could be opinionated, irritable, kind, generous, judgmental, funny and good-natured all in one short time period. We loved him.\u201d For <a href=\"http://www.peggyseeger.com/\" title=\"\">Peggy Seeger</a>, another artist who was helped by Young, he was \u201coff-the-wall, full of talk, welcoming to everyone\u201d.</p> <p>Born in New York, Israel Young was the son of Philip and Pola, Jewish immigrants who had moved to the US from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, in Poland. Izzy\u2019s father ran a Brooklyn bakery, while his mother worked in Chinese restaurants to help the family finances. Izzy attended high school in the Bronx and later studied at Brooklyn College. While a student he became fascinated by folk dance and folk music, joining the American Square Dance Group. After working for his father\u2019s bakery he became a dealer in folk music books, and then opened the Folklore Center.</p> <p>As a promoter, Young staged shows across New York, including events at his own shop, where Traum remembers seeing \u201cthe New Lost City Ramblers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/dec/04/liam-clancy-dies-obituary\" title=\"\">the Clancy Brothers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/04/odetta-film-folk-music-obituary\" title=\"\">Odetta</a>, among others, in Izzy\u2019s very small store\u201d.</p> <p>In 1957 he promoted a concert at the Actors Playhouse for the young Peggy Seeger, who remembers that \u201cit was completely solo, and I had no contemporary songs, just folk songs \u2013 he gave me that opportunity\u201d. Four years later he put on <a href=\"http://active-listener.blogspot.com/2012/02/bob-dylan-carnegie-chapter-hall-1961.html\" title=\"\">Dylan\u2019s first major concert</a>, at Carnegie Chapter Hall, in November 1961, a few months after Dylan had arrived in the city.</p> <p>Earlier that year, he was involved in what became known as <a href=\"http://www.washingtonsquareparkblog.com/2015/04/27/right-to-perform-music-washington-square-park-april-1961-folk-riot-now/\" title=\"\">the \u201cfolk riot\u201d</a>, after the New York city parks department banned folk musicians from Washington Square Park, a long-established meeting place in Greenwich Village. Hundreds of musicians took part in the protest, and Traum noted that Young sang The Star Spangled Banner, This Land Is Your Land \u201cand other patriotic songs in his decidedly unmusical voice\u201d. The city eventually relented and folk singing was restored.</p> <p>Young also helped to establish one of New York\u2019s most celebrated folk clubs. In 1960 he persuaded Mike Porco, a friend who owned a bar and restaurant called Gerde\u2019s, to put in a stage and sound equipment and host folk shows. But due to a lack of business acumen, Young lost control of the venue within a few months, and it was taken over by others. As Gerde\u2019s Folk City, it became one of the most successful venues in New York.</p> <p>His other folk-related ventures included writing for the magazine <a href=\"https://singout.org/\" title=\"\">Sing Out!</a> for 15 years, and hosting a regular music show on the New York radio station WBAI. He was successful at everything \u2013 except making money. Ben Paley, the son of the musician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/02/tom-paley-obituary\" title=\"\">Tom Paley</a>, remembers his father calling Young \u201ca lovely man with a terrible head for business. He was so bad that he would sell something for less than he paid for it.\u201d </p> <p>In 1973, Young moved to Stockholm, with his French partner, Catherine Grandin. There he started the Folklore Centrum, modelled on his original New York base, but with performances by Swedish and international musicians, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/21/tom-and-ben-paley-paley-and-son-review\" title=\"\">Tom and Ben Paley</a>. Ben noted that Young \u201cspoke immaculate Swedish \u2013 but with a Bronx accent\u201d.</p> <p>In 1989 Young returned to Greenwich Village to film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If3WGtI5v9s\" title=\"\">the documentary Talking Folklore Center</a>, named after an unrecorded early Dylan song about the MacDougal Street store. Young\u2019s archives of the New York folk scene, including his diaries, now form <a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/folklife/2017/10/finding-aid-to-izzy-young-collection-now-online/\" title=\"\">a collection in the Library of Congress</a>.</p> <p>He is survived by Catherine, their daughter Philom\u00e8ne, by a son, Thilo Egenberger, from another relationship, and three grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 Israel Goodman Young, music promoter and writer, born 26 March 1928; died 4 February 2019</p>",

After working for his father\u2019s bakery he became a dealer in folk music books, and then opened the Folklore Center. As a promoter, Young staged shows across New York, including events at his own shop, where Traum remembers seeing \u201cthe New Lost City Ramblers, the Clancy Brothers and Odetta, among others, in Izzy\u2019s very small store\u201d. In 1957 he promoted a concert at the Actors Playhouse for the young Peggy Seeger, who remembers that \u201cit was completely solo, and I had no contemporary songs, just folk songs \u2013 he gave me that opportunity\u201d. Four years later he put on Dylan\u2019s first major concert, at Carnegie Chapter Hall, in November 1961, a few months after Dylan had arrived in the city. Earlier that year, he was involved in what became known as the \u201cfolk riot\u201d, after the New York city parks department banned folk musicians from Washington Square Park, a long-established meeting place in Greenwich Village. Hundreds of musicians took part in the protest, and Traum noted that Young sang The Star Spangled Banner, This Land Is Your Land \u201cand other patriotic songs in his decidedly unmusical voice\u201d. The city eventually relented and folk singing was restored. Young also helped to establish one of New York\u2019s most celebrated folk clubs. In 1960 he persuaded Mike Porco, a friend who owned a bar and restaurant called Gerde\u2019s, to put in a stage and sound equipment and host folk shows. But due to a lack of business acumen, Young lost control of the venue within a few months, and it was taken over by others. As Gerde\u2019s Folk City, it became one of the most successful venues in New York. His other folk-related ventures included writing for the magazine Sing Out! for 15 years, and hosting a regular music show on the New York radio station WBAI. He was successful at everything \u2013 except making money. Ben Paley, the son of the musician Tom Paley, remembers his father calling Young \u201ca lovely man with a terrible head for business. He was so bad that he would sell something for less than he paid for it.\u201d In 1973, Young moved to Stockholm, with his French partner, Catherine Grandin. There he started the Folklore Centrum, modelled on his original New York base, but with performances by Swedish and international musicians, including Tom and Ben Paley. Ben noted that Young \u201cspoke immaculate Swedish \u2013 but with a Bronx accent\u201d. In 1989 Young returned to Greenwich Village to film the documentary Talking Folklore Center, named after an unrecorded early Dylan song about the MacDougal Street store. Young\u2019s archives of the New York folk scene, including his diaries, now form a collection in the Library of Congress. He is survived by Catherine, their daughter Philom\u00e8ne, by a son, Thilo Egenberger, from another relationship, and three grandchildren. \u2022 Israel Goodman Young, music promoter and writer, born 26 March 1928; died 4 February 2019",

In fact, if you have, give yourself a million fashion points for being quick off the mark. I hadn\u2019t until a few days ago, when a friend showed me a screengrab with Koizumi\u2019s name, and a time and a place for his last-minute show. Now I am obsessed with him. Koizumi\u2019s dresses are joyous and frothy. They bob along like baby ducklings in a colour palette that is best described as unicorn-meets-rainbow. They are utterly beautiful \u2013 but, surely, kind of unwearable. Tulle is what you make tutus out of, after all. Nobody actually wears it. Or so I thought. And then, watching the Baftas on Sunday night, there was Rachel Weisz gliding across the stage in an ivory tulle Gucci gown with vast sleeves and a tiered full-length skirt to pick up her best supporting actress award.

He was the best goalkeeper I ever saw, and a really friendly and considerate person, extremely genuine. I got to know him a bit when I was at Keele University, where the Stoke team used to come and train and also helped out with the uni team (who were pretty poor). He was a good and tolerant friend of Neil Baldwin (perennial Stoke City mascot and main character of the wonderful BBC film Marvellous). He also made the best save I ever saw. In February 1970, Stoke drew at home 2-2 against Manchester United. Fairly late in the second half, George Best was near the halfway line when a long ball was played in his direction. He outsprinted a wrong-footed defence and found himself completely alone. Banks came off his line, up to about the penalty spot, and seeing this, Best set himself up for a perfect lob from the edge of the area. The ball was on its way and there was no way Banks could stop it \u2026 or so we thought. As the ball came towards him, Banks launched himself into the air, upwards and at the same time backwards. As the ball passed over, his body was angled at about 45 degrees back towards his goal, and he flayed out with his right arm, hitting the ball with a tremendous blow of his fingertips. Instead of continuing its intended path to the back of the net, the ball was diverted in its trajectory, clearing the bar by about three or four feet for a corner. The whole crowd was stunned into silence at this sheer brilliance, quite possibly the best save in the history of the game. Sadly there were no cameras there to record the event. It\u2019s a memory that has stayed with me ever since, and although I\u2019ve seen plenty of other good saves, and lots of other good goalkeepers, I am firmly convinced that Gordon Banks was the best ever, as well as being a very nice man.

FIVER LETTER \u201cI am very sad to read of Gordon Banks\u2019s death, one of the heroes of my youth. He was the best goalkeeper I ever saw, and a really friendly and considerate person, extremely genuine. I got to know him a bit when I was at Keele University, where the Stoke team used to come and train and also helped out with the uni team (who were pretty poor). He was a good and tolerant friend of Neil Baldwin (perennial Stoke City mascot and main character of the wonderful BBC film Marvellous). He also made the best save I ever saw. In February 1970, Stoke drew at home 2-2 against Manchester United. Fairly late in the second half, George Best was near the halfway line when a long ball was played in his direction. He outsprinted a wrong-footed defence and found himself completely alone. Banks came off his line, up to about the penalty spot, and seeing this, Best set himself up for a perfect lob from the edge of the area. The ball was on its way and there was no way Banks could stop it \u2026 or so we thought. As the ball came towards him, Banks launched himself into the air, upwards and at the same time backwards. As the ball passed over, his body was angled at about 45 degrees back towards his goal, and he flayed out with his right arm, hitting the ball with a tremendous blow of his fingertips. Instead of continuing its intended path to the back of the net, the ball was diverted in its trajectory, clearing the bar by about three or four feet for a corner. The whole crowd was stunned into silence at this sheer brilliance, quite possibly the best save in the history of the game. Sadly there were no cameras there to record the event. It\u2019s a memory that has stayed with me ever since, and although I\u2019ve seen plenty of other good saves, and lots of other good goalkeepers, I am firmly convinced that Gordon Banks was the best ever, as well as being a very nice man.

Nange Magro, a Japanese-Italian designer who works primarily with latex, posted images on Instagram comparing designs she made in 2015 for her label Dead Lotus Couture with those worn by Mon\u00e1e on stage at the Grammys. Magro wrote: Amazing performance by Janelle at the Grammys. She and her dancers looked great. I\u2019m deeply DISAPPOINTED, though, that their outfits looked so much like one of Dead Lotus Couture\u2019s 2015 classic designs. I could\u2019ve made it for them if they contacted me. Nobody likes to see unauthorised copies of their original creations \u2013 be it in music, art or fashion. I am flattered to be an inspiration for this amazing artist, but not flattered that my original design has been blatantly imitated. Mon\u00e1e has previously been pictured wearing Dead Lotus Couture designs, and an image of her appears on their website. The Guardian has asked the musician for comment via her UK label representatives. Plagiarism is a constant topic in both pop music and fashion design. In 2016, Moschino designer Jeremy Scott made an undisclosed settlement with graffiti artist Joseph Tierney, after Tierney accused him of plagiarising one of his artworks for a dress worn by Katy Perry to the 2015 Met Gala. Other recent cases in the fashion world include a 2017 incident in which two artists accused Gucci of imitating their designs. The fashion label responded that they were merely in \u201ca creative exchange with street style and street vernacular\u201d. They offered to collaborate directly with the pair, who both refused. In March 2018, Vivienne Westwood apologised to fellow fashion designers Louise Gray and Rottingdean Bazaar after she imitated one of their designs, saying: \u201cWe are sorry. The use of your graphics on our T-shirt was only ever meant to be a celebration of your work.\u201d This week, the luxury shoe designer Christian Louboutin won a seven-year battle against Dutch company Van Haren, who are now forbidden from copying the distinctive red sole from Louboutin shoes. In music, meanwhile, numerous artists have made agreements with songwriters over plagiarised songs in recent years, most notoriously Ed Sheeran, Lana Del Rey, and Pharrell and Robin Thicke.",

Junqueras\u2019 advocate, Andreu Van den Eynde, dismissed the case as a politically motivated exercise and told the court that prosecutors were trying to criminalise displays of free expression and curtail the defendants\u2019 right to argue for self-determination. \u201cNo international or EU law blocks the secession of a regional entity; self-determination is synonymous with peace and not war,\u201d he said. Van den Eynde, who is also representing the former Catalan foreign minister Ra\u00fcl Romeva, said his clients\u2019 freedom of expression had been violated. \u201cThe political arena is a free space,\u201d he said. \u201cFreedom of expression extends even to those ideas that shock and offend.\u201d He described the complicated legal process as a \u201cprocedural vaudeville\u201d and said it was intended to put Catalan independence itself on trial. Jordi Pina, a lawyer representing the Catalan MP and former civil society leader Jordi S\u00e0nchez, called for the court to allow testimony from King Felipe, arguing that the Spanish monarch\u2019s controversial speech two days after the referendum had been cited in prosecution documents. The king had accused Catalan authorities of attempting to break \u201cthe unity of Spain\u201d and warned that their push for independence could risk the country\u2019s social and economic stability. Pina also urged the court to reconsider its decision not to allow testimony from the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont via videolink from Brussels. The trial \u2013 which began shortly after 10.20am on Tuesday and is being broadcast on television \u2013 will focus on the Puigdemont government\u2019s decision to hold the referendum despite repeated warnings that it would violate the constitution, which stresses the \u201cindissoluble unity of the Spanish nation\u201d. Although Catalan pro-independence parties have never managed to win 50% of the vote in the regional parliament, and although polls consistently show Catalonia is roughly evenly split over the independence issue, Puigdemont\u2019s administration chose to press ahead with the vote. Pro-independence parties managed to get a law paving the way for the referendum passed in the regional parliament in early September 2017, despite furious objections from opposition MPs, who complained that usual procedures had been disregarded. The law was subsequently suspended and eventually struck down by Spain\u2019s constitutional court. But the Catalan government opted to hold the referendum, which was marred by violence. Spanish police officers raided polling stations, charged crowds with batons and fired rubber bullets in their attempts to stop the vote. According to the Catalan government, about 2.3 million of Catalonia\u2019s 5.3 million registered voters \u2013 43% \u2013 took part in the referendum, and about 90% of participants backed independence. The vote was largely boycotted by unionist Catalans. On 27 October, shortly after secessionist Catalan MPs voted to declare independence, the Spanish government of the then prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, won senate backing to sack Puigdemont and his cabinet and assume direct control of Catalonia. Defence lawyers will seek to undermine the rebellion charges. They will point out that, under Spanish law, rebellion consists of \u201crevolting violently and publicly\u201d, and argue that none of those charged with the offence engaged in violence. Speaking to the Guardian and a small group of other European reporters in Madrid on the eve of the trial, the Catalan president, Quim Torra, criticised the charges. \u201cThe only violence we saw throughout September and October [2017] was from the Spanish police,\u201d he said. \u201cThey tried to stop citizens from going to vote peacefully on 1 October. But this has all been turned on its head. There was no violence, everyone saw there was no violence.\u201d The case will once again bring international attention to the enduring tensions between the Madrid government and the pro-independence regional government of Catalonia. The president of the supreme court, Carlos Lesmes, has described the proceedings as \u201cthe most important trial that we\u2019ve held since democracy [returned]\u201d. But on Monday night, Torra said: \u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned, Spanish justice has pretty much zero credibility.\u201d His sacked predecessor, meanwhile, called the trial a \u201cstress test for Spanish democracy\u201d and a test for the country\u2019s judiciary. Speaking in Berlin on Tuesday, Puigdemont described his former colleagues on trial as \u201chonourable, innocent, democratic people,\u201d and insisted there were \u201cno criminal violations of the Spanish criminal law\u201d. The start of the trial led some Catalan pro-independence protesters to briefly block several roads before dawn, setting fire to tyres and holding up traffic. Protests were called in Barcelona for 7pm.",

      "bodyText": "Mako Vunipola has been ruled out of England\u2019s final three Six Nations matches. The Saracens prop, who missed the autumn campaign because of injury, suffered ankle ligament damage against France on Sunday and will be out of action for an expected 10 weeks. Vunipola has been instrumental in England\u2019s winning start to the tournament. He was the man of the match against Ireland in Dublin at the start of the month when he made 23 tackles. Ben Moon was on the bench against France on Sunday having displaced Ellis Genge, leaving Eddie Jones with a decision to make for the match against Wales in Cardiff next week. \u201cIt is very disappointing to lose Mako at this stage,\u201d said the England coach, whose side are potentially a victory in Wales away from reclaiming the title from Ireland having secured a try bonus point in each of their two victories. Italy and Scotland at home follow. \u201cHe is an important player for us but it does provide an opportunity for the team to grow.\u201d Saracens said in a statement: \u201cFollowing medical assessments Mako Vunipola has been ruled out of England\u2019s Six Nations campaign with an ankle ligament injury. Vunipola is expected to be out for 10 weeks. The prop will begin his rehabilitation with Saracens.\u201d Vunipola was out for eight weeks with a calf strain sustained during Saracens\u2019 European Champions Cup match at Glasgow in October. They face the same opponents in the quarter-finals at the end of next month. Wales will be without their No 8 Taulupe Faletau for the whole tournament. He suffered a broken arm playing for Bath last week in his return from the same injury and needs further surgery. Wales had hoped he would be available for at least their final match against Ireland but no date has been put on his comeback. \u201cWe\u2019re gutted for Taulupe but this is the best course of action for him,\u201d said the Bath director of rugby, Todd Blackadder. \u201cWe will know more in terms of a time frame following the surgery but we\u2019re looking forward to welcoming him back into the squad.\u201d Better news for Wales is the return of Leigh Halfpenny to full training three months after he was concussed during the victory over Australia. He will be available for selection against England but after so long out he is more likely to be a contender for the bench than a starting position. \u201cLeigh is symptom-free and is taking full contact,\u201d said the Scarlets\u2019 coach, Wayne Pivac. \u201cHe has trained with us for three days and done everything, including taking high balls and getting clattered. He goes back to Wales available to play. Warren Gatland [the coach] will decide what to do from there.\u201d The Scarlets have a Pro14 match in Treviso on Saturday, for which Halfpenny may be released. \u201cWe will get a message about who, if anyone, is getting released after Wales train on Wednesday,\u201d Pivac said.

And to be honest it\u2019s probably the same view that May is taking \u2013 both essentially running down the clock to the final vote date. Thursday sees the start of extended debate in Parliament as to what happens next as they vote on \u2018Plan B\u2019 and the rest of the alphabet options. </p> <p>\u201cHowever not much really can come next \u2013 all that she hopes will happen is that those who voted overwhelmingly against her in her first attempt to pass the original deal through Parliament may be spooked that with so little time left and with the prospect of no-deal being so disastrous that they will have to switch to support her original deal. This uncertainty would be reflected in increased sterling and market volatility and, cynically, the government could use market turbulence to its advantage to push through a deal. It\u2019s a supremely high stakes game of chicken she is playing with both the EU and the UK parliament. She reaffirmed her promise to allow the final vote on her \u2018probably unaltered\u2019 original on the 27th of this month. Einstein\u2019s definition of lunacy was to keep doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.</p> <p>\u201cThe government\u2019s actions are negative for the UK economy, currency and assets \u2013 which don\u2019t look tradable to us at this point. The question remains what happens should the prime minister\u2019s efforts fail again? Delaying the March deadline and trying again wouldn\u2019t be beyond the realms of the lunacy so far we have seen in Parliament. The other avenue is a hard Brexit which has no support at all and so cannot be expected to happen. There is still the faint likelihood of the \u201cPeople\u2019s vote\u201d option \u2013 I\u2019m undecided if that ship has sailed yet. Right now it seems that delaying until her deal is forced through Parliament is the most likely option.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c62d8d4e4b042feedcbc5fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T14:51:02.657Z\">2.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back in the markets, Wall Street has opened higher, on relief that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/feb/12/markets-boosted-by-us-government-shutdown-deal-and-trade-war-hopes-business-live?page=with:block-5c62718de4b00ef6acc6c3ba#block-5c62718de4b00ef6acc6c3ba\">another US government shutdown has probably been averted</a>.</strong></p> <p>The Dow Jones industrial average has gained around 1%, with the broader S&amp;P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq also posting gains. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/markets/status/1095329371617845250\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">U.S. markets open higher <a href=\"https://t.co/mthDWhnw5K\">https://t.co/mthDWhnw5K</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/QJrnsAChX4\">pic.twitter.com/QJrnsAChX4</a></p>&mdash;

Over the subsequent two years, a widespread and increasingly vigorous global expansion took hold. For the first time since the financial crisis, business investment and foreign trade grew strongly across all major regions. Economic uncertainty diminished, and consumer and business confidence firmed. In economies close to full employment, real wages finally began to grow.</p> <p>A new beginning seemed possible.</p> <p>In the past few quarters, however, these trends have largely reversed. After peaking a year ago around 4%, global momentum is now weakening in all major regions and downside risks have intensified. The proportion of the global economy growing above trend has fallen from four-fifths to one-third. Trade growth has slowed and the export outlook has dimmed.

      "bodyText": "Finally, those Brexit worries \u2018helped\u2019 the London stock market to underperform vs other exchanges. The FTSE 100 ended the day up 4 points at 7,133, while Germany\u2019s DAX gained 1% and France\u2019s CAC picked up 0.8%. Decent results from tyre maker Michelin helped European car manufacturers. Over in New York, the relief rally has now pushed the Dow up by 341 points, to 25,395 points. Here\u2019s our economics editor, Larry Elliott, on governor Carney\u2019s speech: Brexit is an acid test of whether it is possible to reshape globalisation in a way that offers the benefits of trade while allaying public fears about the erosion of democracy, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has said. Speaking in London, Carney said the ramifications of the UK\u2019s departure from the EU would be felt around the world and would determine whether it was possible to shrug off rising protectionism in favour of a new era of international cooperation. The governor cited trade tensions and the result of the 2016 referendum as examples of fundamental pressures to reorder globalisation. \u201cIt is possible that new rules of the road will be developed for a more inclusive and resilient global economy. At the same time, there is a risk that countries turn inwards, undercutting growth and prosperity for all.\u201d The FT\u2019s Kate Allen was also struck by Carney\u2019s comments on Brexit, and the dangers that a trade disruption causes: \u201cWe are 45 days before the possibility of [no-deal happening] . . . we should not be under any illusions \u2014 no-deal Brexit would be a shock for this economy and send a signal globally about the prospects of refounding globalisation,\u201d he said at the event, which was hosted by the Financial Times. Asked whether Brexit was a canary in the coal mine for the new global order, Mr Carney replied: \u201cThe bird may be towards the bottom of the cage, but it is still fluttering.\u201d FT: Carney says Brexit offers \u2018acid test\u2019 on future of global trade Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway has mopped up some of the best charts from the speech (it\u2019s not proper central bankers\u2019 speech without a few visual aides) The Telegraph\u2019s Tom Rees has flagged up Carney\u2019s warning that a trade war could cause an economic crunch not seen since the mid-1970s. As the governor put it: Most fundamentally, the larger and the more permanent the disruption to global trade\u2014the greater the de- globalisation\u2014the greater the reduction in both activity and supply capacity of economies. The latter\u2014a material hit to supply\u2014is something that advanced economies have not experienced since the mid-1970s. In this scenario, the combination of slower growth, smaller surpluses in Asia and higher risk premia could move global interest rates higher, increasing the burden of corporate and household debts and challenging the creditworthiness of some sovereigns. Charles Hepworth, Investment Director at asset manager GAM, says the Brexit deadlock is making some UK assets \u2018untradable\u2019. Here\u2019s his take on the situation as we rattle towards Brexit Day with no certainty over the future: \u201cNegotiations are stuck with the EU refusing to concede on any points \u2013 the already agreed deal is the final deal as far as they are concerned. And to be honest it\u2019s probably the same view that May is taking \u2013 both essentially running down the clock to the final vote date. Thursday sees the start of extended debate in Parliament as to what happens next as they vote on \u2018Plan B\u2019 and the rest of the alphabet options. \u201cHowever not much really can come next \u2013 all that she hopes will happen is that those who voted overwhelmingly against her in her first attempt to pass the original deal through Parliament may be spooked that with so little time left and with the prospect of no-deal being so disastrous that they will have to switch to support her original deal. This uncertainty would be reflected in increased sterling and market volatility and, cynically, the government could use market turbulence to its advantage to push through a deal. It\u2019s a supremely high stakes game of chicken she is playing with both the EU and the UK parliament. She reaffirmed her promise to allow the final vote on her \u2018probably unaltered\u2019 original on the 27th of this month. Einstein\u2019s definition of lunacy was to keep doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. \u201cThe government\u2019s actions are negative for the UK economy, currency and assets \u2013 which don\u2019t look tradable to us at this point. The question remains what happens should the prime minister\u2019s efforts fail again? Delaying the March deadline and trying again wouldn\u2019t be beyond the realms of the lunacy so far we have seen in Parliament. The other avenue is a hard Brexit which has no support at all and so cannot be expected to happen. There is still the faint likelihood of the \u201cPeople\u2019s vote\u201d option \u2013 I\u2019m undecided if that ship has sailed yet. Right now it seems that delaying until her deal is forced through Parliament is the most likely option.\u201d Back in the markets, Wall Street has opened higher, on relief that another US government shutdown has probably been averted. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained around 1%, with the broader S&amp;P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq also posting gains. London\u2019s early rally has fizzled out, though - the FTSE 100 is now flat, after Theresa May continues to run the Brexit clock down. Back on Brexit, governor Carney is hammering home the need for certainty, warning that the situation could go \u201cquite badly\u201d. But he also agrees that the economy has strengths, such as the state of household and corporate balance sheers, readiness of financial sector for Brexit and the long-established strengths of the economy. Carney also suggests that global conflicts could be the trigger that ends the global expansion. Mark Carney is now taking some questions about his speech (highlights start here). The FT\u2019s Chris Giles whizzes a fast delivery at the governor: Q: Are you saying that Britain is the canary in the coal mine for the new world order, and it\u2019s not going very well\u2026. Carney is tempted into playing the metaphor, joking that: The bird may be towards the bottom of the cage, but it\u2019s still fluttering. He then explains that Brexit is a leading indicator - but the factors that led to the the Brexit vote are also building in other countries, and will create new challenges there too. So policymakers need to rethink trade rules, and adjust the balance between rules made domestically and beyond. As Carney puts it The fundamental issue at the heart of the Brexit discussions - \u2026. are ones which the global economy needs to grapple with. Thus, it will be \u201ca source of deep concern\u201d if the Uk and EU can\u2019t reach an agreement, as it won\u2019t be a good leading indicator of how other countries will cope with similar challenges in the future. This is why the Bank of England is concerned about China\u2019s slowing economy: During his speech, Mark Carney also cites the idea that globalisation has created an impossible \u201cpolitical trilemma\u201d. Basically, that we can\u2019t have democratic accountability, national sovereignty AND be fully integrated in the global economy. Any two is fine, but the hat-trick is impossible (ie - a eurozone country surrenders some sovereignty when it joins the single currency, while any country loses democratic accountability if the IMF imposes bailout conditions). It\u2019s an idea created by Harvard academic Dani Rodrik (see here). As Carney puts it: Globalisation leads to imbalances of democracy and sovereignty, leading many to lament a loss of control and to lose trust in the system. As Dani Rodrik has argued, there is a trilemma between economic integration, democracy and sovereignty. Common rules and standards are required for trade in goods, services and capital, but those rules cede or, at best pool, sovereignty. To maintain legitimacy, the process of agreeing those standards needs to be rooted in democratic accountability. Much will be required to create a more inclusive, sustainable globalisation but part of the solution is a more flexible and open trading system for services and for small and medium enterprises. Mark Carney also warns that Brexit has hurt the UK economy - and is a warning of the damage that global trade uncertainty can cause. Citing yesterday\u2019s weak UK GDP report, he says: UK business investment has fallen 3.7% over the past year despite the ongoing expansion, high business profitability and accommodative financial conditions. With fundamental uncertainty about future market access, UK investment hasn\u2019t grown since the referendum was called and has dramatically underperformed both history and peers Mark Carney rounds off his speech with a pop at Donald Trump, telling his audience at the Barbican that \u201cContrary to what you might have heard, it isn\u2019t easy to win a trade war.\u201d And he concludes with some eye-catching comments on Brexit, saying it\u2019s important to reach a \u201csolution\u201d in the coming weeks. Britain\u2019s departure from the EU, he says, will be an \u2018acid test\u2019 of whether politicians can achieve a new form of international co-operation, while respecting democratic accountability. As the governor puts it: If the UK has been somewhat more inwardly focused of late, it has been for good reason. In many respects, Brexit is the first test of a new global order and could prove the acid test of whether a way can be found to broaden the benefits of openness while enhancing democratic accountability. Brexit can lead to a new form of international cooperation and cross-border commerce built on a better balance of local and supranational authorities. In these respects, Brexit could affect both the short and long-term global outlooks. And finally, he returns to that old explorer, Sir Martin Frobisher, who we heard about a few minutes ago. It is in the interests of everyone, arguably everywhere \u2013 from Frobisher\u2019s grave to Frobisher\u2019s Bay - that a Brexit solution that works for all is found in the weeks ahead. Some tweets from Mark Carney\u2019s speech: Turning to globalisation, Carney says it has brought \u201cwidespread prosperity\u201d, but it has also created external imbalances \u2014 with large trade surpluses in some countries (eg Germany), and deficits in others (eg UK) (corrected!). Plus, the benefits haven\u2019t been shared evenly: Rather, the benefits from trade are unequally spread across individuals and time. Consumers get lower prices and new products, and further benefits from higher productivity over time. Some workers, however, lose their jobs and the dignity of work, or see their \u201cfactor prices equalised.\u201d In plain English, their wages fall. Mark Carney cites the risk of China\u2019s slowing economy, the push for \u201cde-globalisation\u201d, and rising protectionism as key threats. He also warns that policymakers may struggle to spot a recession, until it happens: Given the confluence of the current broad-based slowdown and outstanding downside risks, some are beginning to wonder whether the global expansion, begun in 2010, could be starting to end. Recessions are notoriously difficult to predict. The IMF has anticipated only a sixth of the over 300 recessions in member countries since 1991. Financial markets are more likely to cry wolf, making Paul Samuelson\u2019s observation fifty years ago that \u201cthe stock market has predicted nine of the past five recessions\u201d as relevant today as it was then. For what it is worth, market-implied probabilities of a recession in the US are around 20%, nearly three times higher relative to this time a year ago. Mark Carney says the deceleration in the world economy is partly because central bankers have begun tightening monetary policy (through higher interest rates), as they (slowly) unwind the stimulus packages created after the financial crisis. But there is another culprit -- trade wars. The BoE governor says: Potentially more seriously, the slowing in global momentum may also be the product of rising trade tensions and growing policy uncertainty. Over in the Frobisher Hall at London\u2019s Barbican, Mark Carney is delivering his speech on the global economy. The Bank of England governor begins with a nod to his Canadian homeland, telling his audience that their location is named after Sir Martin Frobisher, an English navigator who scoured Canada\u2019s eastern arctic coast in the 16th century looking for new trade routes. (apparently most of Sir Martin\u2019s remains are buried in the St Giles-in-the-Fields churchyard, although St Andrew\u2019s Church in Plymouth snaffled his heart and entrails). Carney says there is a link between Sir Martin and the world economy: Martin Frobisher is perhaps more famous in Canada than in his native land. One of the great bays in the eastern arctic is named after him. The capital of Nunavut, Iqaluit, lies at the innermost end of Frobisher Bay. Nine years ago this month Iqaluit hosted the G7 meeting that marked the start of the euro crisis. Events that still reverberate today including in the environs of the Barbican. That G7 meeting also treated us to the sight of Carney\u2019s predecessor, Mervyn King, taking a somewhat undignified trip on a dog sled. Conditions today may look better than in 2010, when the world was struggling back from the financial crisis. Carney, though, sees problems ahead.... While the debate in the United Kingdom has been understandably dominated by Brexit, the world has been otherwise engaged. When the Referendum was being held, the global economy was emerging from a long period of financial repair and lacklustre growth. Over the subsequent two years, a widespread and increasingly vigorous global expansion took hold. For the first time since the financial crisis, business investment and foreign trade grew strongly across all major regions. Economic uncertainty diminished, and consumer and business confidence firmed. In economies close to full employment, real wages finally began to grow. A new beginning seemed possible. In the past few quarters, however, these trends have largely reversed. After peaking a year ago around 4%, global momentum is now weakening in all major regions and downside risks have intensified. The proportion of the global economy growing above trend has fallen from four-fifths to one-third. Trade growth has slowed and the export outlook has dimmed. Capital goods orders are stagnating, investment growth has become more tepid, and business confidence is diminished. Heads-up. Bank of England governor Mark Carney will be speaking in London shortly, about the world economy, and key risks to the global outlook. The oil price has also risen today, on hopes of a trade breakthrough in Beijing. US crude is up almost 2% at $53.37 per barrel. An aeroplane carrying top US officials had landed in Beijing, ready for their crunch meeting with China vice-premier Liu He (president Xi\u2019s top economic advisor) later this week. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters that his team are \u201clooking forward to several important days of talks\u201d. Remembering his manners, Mnuching thanked everyone for turning up at his hotel to greet him, saying it was \u201cgreat to be here back in Beijing\u201d (following earlier talks in December). That\u2019s fine, as far as it goes -- but it\u2019s not a hint that a trade deal will be reached this week. Some US officials have already been holding talks at the China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce yesterday, and today. They\u2019re led by led by deputy U.S. trade representative Jeffrey Gerrish. Wall Street is expected to open higher in three hours time, following those gains in Asia and Europe. Here\u2019s how Royal Bank of Canada sums up the scene: Asia-Pacific equity indices were in the green overnight, led by Japanese stocks which rallied over 2%, amid growing risk-on sentiment after President Trump\u2019s optimistic remarks about China in a rally in Texas saying he would \u201cmake great deals on trade\u201d and that he doesn\u2019t want China \u201cto have a hard time\u201d. This speech came soon after an advisor told Fox the president might hold talks in Florida with Xi Jinping next month. Adding to the positive risk-on sentiment, lawmakers have agreed to a provisional border security deal in order to avoid another government shutdown. The plan includes $1.375 billion for border fencing, however, falling short of Trump\u2019s $5.7 billion, according to Bloomberg reports. Although stocks are up today, there\u2019s still plenty of nervousness out there about the long-term prospects for equities. Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s latest fund manager survey, just released, shows that the US-China trade war is the top \u2018tail risk\u2019 worrying investors, followed by a Chinese economic \u2018hard landing\u2019. The survey also shows that money managers moved out of stocks and into cash this month, a sign they\u2019re worried that a correction could be approaching (given the rash of weak economic data and profit warnings). The survey also shows that investors believe buying emerging markets stocks is the most crowded trade out there -- which could be a problem if everyone heads for the door at the same time. Maybe it\u2019s something to do with the weather (the sun was spotted over the City this morning), but City experts are in an optimistic mood. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says the shutdown breakthrough, and hopes of a US-China trade deal, have raise spirits. I got to work with markets in a pleasant mood and spring threatening to break out in London. It was all going swimmingly until Word froze..... ah well, nothing lasts for ever.... The US government shutdown seems to have been averted and there\u2019s a strong chance that import tariffs on Chinese goods will be postponed. Risk is on. Paul Donovan of UBS also sees reasons to be cheerful, saying: Good news flows from the US. US President Trump has indicated (albeit not with the majesty of a tweet) that great trade deals are just around the corner. An administration official hinted at a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi \u201csoon\u201d. As trade taxes are effectively a tax on equities, this has been well received by Asian risk markets. The US Congress may also be approaching the point where they do not need to shut down the government (again). A possible deal on a border wall has been agreed by negotiators from the two parties. This may reduce fears about the scale of partisan disruption later this year. Just in: MPs and Lords are calling for Britain\u2019s \u201cflawed\u201d RPI inflation measure to be fixed. The House of Commons\u2019 Treasury Committee and the House of Lords\u2019 Economic Affairs Committee are jointly demanding that the government gives the UK Statistics Authority the authority to amend known problems with RPI. RPI typically gives a higher reading than the consumer prices index (CPI). Thus, it\u2019s unfair that the government uses RPI to raise the price of things we pay for - such as season tickets and student loans - while relying on CPI for benefits such as pensions. [the problem is that RPI uses a different formula than CPI, and also includes housing costs, so house prices and interest rates moves can make it volatile] The Stats Authority themselves say that RPI is \u201ca very poor measure of inflation\u201d, and refuse to class it as a national statistic. However, it still calculated it each month. Rt Hon. Nicky Morgan MP, Chair of the Treasury Committee, is damning about RPI\u2019s \u201cAs the Treasury Committee has concluded in numerous reports and statements over the years, RPI is a flawed measure of inflation, and it is absurd for the Government to continue to use it. \u201cIt appears grossly unfair that Government formulae affecting people\u2019s incomes, such as pensions and benefits, often use CPI, whereas formulae affecting outgoings, including student loans, often use RPI, which typically gives a higher rate of inflation. \u201cThe Committee has previously urged the Government to abandon the use of RPI, which has been de-designated as a national statistic. Failing this, the Chancellor should at least consent to UKSA correcting the known errors in the RPI formula.\u201d RPI was 2.7% in the year to January, while CPI came in at 2.1%. Clearly at least one of them is failing to measure the cost of living properly. Back in 2017, the FT\u2019s Chris Giles pointed out that RPI shows that women\u2019s vests and strappy tops have quintupled in price since 2010, while CPI only has them becoming 20% pricier. That\u2019s because of an adjustment (now clearly a mistake) made in 2010, which hasn\u2019t been fixed. Now that might seem just a wacky talking point, until you remember that RPI is also used to calculate how much interest is paid to investors who own UK government debt. They\u2019re at least \u00a315bn better off thanks to RPI, which means taxpayers have LOST \u00a315bn. Back in the UK, shares in struggling retailer Debenhams have surged 40% (yay!) to the giddy heights of, umm, 4.5p, after it secured a funding lifeline. The new \u00a340m credit facility should help Debenhams keep operating, as it continues to negotiate with its lenders to restructure its debts. Sergio Bucher, the chief executive, hailed the new 12-month credit facility as a \u201cfirst step in our refinancing process\u201d. It comes after three profit warnings in 2018, and warnings that the company would not survive without a debt deal. Even after today\u2019s rally, Debenhams is only valued at around \u00a353m - versus debts of over \u00a3280m If the US government crisis is averted, investors will be free to worry about other issues - such as the eurozone. And one of the front-runners to replace Mario Draghi as head of the European Cenral Bank has just warned that the euro area isn\u2019t fully protected from another crisis. He cited the fact that many eurozone banks are big holders of their own national debt, which amplifies any financial problems. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann told an audience in Pretoria that: \u201cCertain issues like the lack of credibility of fiscal rules or the harmful sovereign-bank nexus still have to be adequately addressed. Weidmann - a hawkish critic of some of Draghi\u2019s measures to save the euro - also warned that central bankers are being force to take political decisions beyond their remit. \u201cActing beyond the mandate would also undermine people*s trust in the central bank....At the end of the day, it could become more and more difficult for the European Central Bank to focus on its promise of a stable currency.\u201d European stock markets have all jumped in early trading, following gains in Asia overnight. Germany\u2019s DAX is leading the way, up almost 1%, while in London, the FTSE 100 is up 25 points or 0.35%. Earlier, China\u2019s Shanghai index gained 0.7%, Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX picked up 0.3%, while the Nikkei\u2019s 2.6% jump is the standout performance (exporters surged as the yen dipped against the US dollar) Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says investors will be relieved to hear that another US government shutdown can be avoided. No one wants to see another government shutdown, especially after a historic one which wasn\u2019t too long ago. These government shutdowns adversely impact the economic health of the country. Resolving the trade war issues with China would also \u201creally improve the sentiment in the markets\u201d, he adds. Donald Trump has put a brave face on his failure to get full funding for his wall with Mexico. At a rally in El Paso, Texas, Trump declared: \u201cJust so you know, we\u2019re building the wall anyway\u201d. (Just not as much as he\u2019d hoped). That talk will play well with the Trump base; some attendees at the rally were carrying signs urging him to \u201cBuild the Wall\u201d. But - possibly in a precursor to the 2020 presidential campaign - Trump found himself vying for attention with Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke who held his own rally in Texas. O\u2019Rourke took a rather different approach to the situation, telling his crowd that: \u201cWith the eyes of the country upon us, all of us together are going to make our stand here in one of the safest cities in America. Safe not because of walls but in spite of walls.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. A burst of optimism is rippling through the markets this morning, after US lawmakers reached a tentative deal to avoid another government shutdown. Overnight, Democrats and Republicans agreed a new spending package, which includes some more money to fund border security. Assuming president Trump signs it off, the deal will keep the Federal government running beyond Friday. After weeks of deadlock, Republican Senator Richard Shelby emerged to tell reporters that \u201can agreement in principle\u201d had been reached, and that staff would be \u201cworking feverishly to put all the particulars together.\u201d The deal will provide some money to construct fencing on the US-Mexico border, but this really doesn\u2019t look like a win for Trump. That\u2019s because Congress is only providing $1.4bn for extra border security, not the $5.7bn the White House had asked for. As my colleague Tom McCarthy explains: The agreement would allocate far less money for Trump\u2019s border wall than the White House\u2019s $5.7bn wish list, settling for a figure of nearly $1.4bn, according to congressional aides. The funding measure is through the fiscal year, which ends 30 September. The agreement means 55 miles of new fencing \u2014 constructed through existing designs such as metal slats instead of a concrete wall \u2014 but far less than the 215 miles the White House demanded in December. The fencing would be built in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. Money has also been set aside for technology such as advanced screening at border entry point, humanitarian aid, and additional customs officers. News of the breakthrough boosted markets in Asia, where Japan\u2019s Nikkei jumped by 2.61%, or 531.04 points, to end at 20,864.21. European markets are expected to rise at the open too. The deal comes as US officials prepare for fresh talks with China over the trade war - another Trump bugbear that has been worrying the markets. Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin and trade representative Robert Lighthizer are due to meet Chinese Vice Premier Liu He in Beijing on Thursday. Yesterday, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway revealed that president Trump is still keen to meet China\u2019s Xi Jinping \u201cvery soon\u201d to hammer out a deal, saying: \u201cThis president wants a deal. He wants it to be fair to Americans and American workers and American interests.\u201d Given the slowing global economy, investors would welcome a breakthrough - before even more tariffs are imposed on US and Chinese goods. Also coming up today Bank of England governor Mark Carney is speaking about the global economy, and risks to the outlook, at an event in London, organised by the Financial Times. Trade wars will probably come up. Otherwise it\u2019s a quiet day. The agenda 1pm GMT: Bank of England governor Mark Carney discusses the global economy",

The Brazil forward\u2019s name will be forever linked with that of Banks as a result of one of the 1970 World Cup\u2019s most memorable moments, with Pel\u00e9 generously suggesting he is happy the goalkeeper kept out his famous header because it led to a subsequent friendship. \u201cI have great sadness in my heart today and I send condolences to the family Gordon was so proud of,\u201d Pel\u00e9 said. \u201cI scored many goals in my life but people always like to ask about the one I didn\u2019t score, because of that save. While it was indeed phenomenal my memory of Gordon is not defined by that but his friendship. He was a kind, warm man who gave so much to people. I am glad he saved my header because it was the start of a friendship I will always treasure. Whenever we met it was like we had never been apart.\u201d The former Chesterfield, Leicester and Stoke goalkeeper was 81, and had been suffering from kidney cancer. Though ever-present in England\u2019s run to the World Cup final Banks was responsible for few heroics or outstanding performances in 1966. His reputation for being virtually unbeatable, almost certainly the best in the world at the time, was largely based on the World Cup four years later, with one save in particular catapulting him into the ranks of lasting legends. The venue was Guadalajara in Mexico, the opposition Brazil, and Jairzinho was running full pelt down the right wing. Most people who witnessed what happened next can vividly remember being momentarily perplexed at where the ball had gone when Pel\u00e9 headed the cross powerfully towards goal, but Alan Mullery was on the pitch at the time so is best-equipped to tell the story. \u201cJairzinho clipped it to the far post, and Pel\u00e9 \u2013 who climbed to such a height better than anyone else \u2013 headed the ball downwards,\u201d Mullery said. \u201cGordon went from one post to the other, flicked the ball with his fingertips and it went over the crossbar. As a joke I said \u2018why didn\u2019t you catch it?\u2019 and the abuse that came back was unbelievable.\u201d Banks himself recalled that Pel\u00e9 had already started to shout \u201cgoal!\u201d before his celebrations were abruptly curtailed. \u201cAs I got to my feet Pel\u00e9 came up to me and patted me on the back,\u201d the goalkeeper said. \u201cHe said, \u2018I thought that was in\u2019, so I said \u2018You and me both!\u2019 If you watch television footage of the game it shows me laughing as I turn to take up my position for the corner. Bobby Moore had just told me I must be getting too old because I used to be able to hold on to those. Like hell I did!\u201d Banks won 73 England caps before his career came to a premature end when a 1972 car crash cost him the sight in one eye. He won Fifa\u2019s goalkeeper of the year award on six occasions, and was voted Footballer of the Year in 1972 \u2013 the year his semi-final penalty save against West Ham helped Stoke win the League Cup \u2013 becoming the first goalkeeper to receive the honour since Manchester City\u2019s Bert Trautmann in 1956. Banks described beating Chelsea in the League Cup final as his proudest moment in club football. He was prouder still of some of his international achievements, though the 1970 World Cup in Mexico ended in disappointment when he was forced to miss the quarter-final against West Germany with food poisoning. With late replacement Peter Bonetti in goal, England let a two goal lead slip and went out of the tournament when Frank Beckenbauer led a German comeback and Gerd M\u00fcller scored a winner in extra time. Until that point it had been one of England\u2019s more convincing World Cup campaigns, they were growing into the tournament and playing like holders, and though Bonetti was not greatly at fault there was inevitable speculation about whether Banks would have been beaten three times. Leading the English tributes, fellow World Cup winner Sir Bobby Charlton said: \u201cGordon was a fantastic goalkeeper, without doubt one of the best England had ever had, I was proud to call him a teammate and he will be deeply missed. Obviously we shared that great day in 1966 but it was more than that. Even though I was on the pitch and have seen it many times since, I still don\u2019t know how he saved that header from Pel\u00e9.\u201d Nearly 49 years later, Pel\u00e9 remains equally baffled. \u201cAs a footballer you know straightaway how well you have hit the ball,\u201d the Brazilian said. \u201cI had hit that header exactly as as I had hoped, put it exactly where I wanted it to go, and I was ready to celebrate. But then Banks appeared in my sight like a blue phantom and somehow pushed my header up and over. Even now when I watch it I can\u2019t believe it, I can\u2019t believe how he moved so far, so fast. The save was one of the best I have ever seen. Rest in peace my friend, you were a goalkeeper with magic but also a fine human being.\u201d Ray Clemence, who with Peter Shilton took over England goalkeeping duties when Banks retired, said receiving help and advice from a personal hero had been invaluable. \u201cGordon made it look easy, and everybody who has played the position knows it is not,\u201d the former Liverpool and Tottenham player said. \u201cHe was the greatest goalkeeper England have had and when Peter and I followed him he was always willing to talk to us.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Europe is sleepwalking into oblivion and its people need to wake up before it is too late. If they don\u2019t, the European Union will go the way of the Soviet Union in 1991. Neither our leaders nor ordinary citizens seem to understand that we are experiencing a revolutionary moment, that the range of possibilities is very broad, and that the eventual outcome is thus highly uncertain.</p> <p>Most of us assume the future will more or less resemble the present, but this is not necessarily so. In a long and eventful life, I have witnessed many periods of what I call radical disequilibrium. We are living in such a period today.</p> <p>The next inflection point will be the elections for the European parliament, in May 2019. Unfortunately, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/28/how-rising-populism-could-shake-up-european-elections\" title=\"\">anti-EU forces will enjoy a competitive advantage</a>. There are several reasons for this, including the outdated party system in most European countries, the practical impossibility of treaty change and the lack of legal tools for disciplining member states that violate the principles on which the EU was founded. The EU can impose its laws on applicant countries but it lacks sufficient capacity to enforce member states\u2019 compliance.</p> <p>The antiquated party system hampers those who want to preserve the values on which the EU was founded, but it helps those who want to replace those values with something radically different. This is true in individual countries and even more so in trans-European alliances. The party system of individual states reflects the divisions that mattered in the 19th and 20th centuries, such as the conflict between capital and labour. But the cleavage that matters most today is between pro- and anti-European forces.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The many voters who remain pro-European have no party to vote for</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The EU\u2019s dominant country is Germany, whose dominant political alliance \u2013 between the Christian Democratic Union and the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union \u2013 has become unsustainable. The alliance worked as long as there was no significant party in Bavaria to the right of the CSU. That changed with the rise of the extremist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/24/germany-elections-afd-europe-immigration-merkel-radical-right\" title=\"\">Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland</a> (AfD). In last September\u2019s <em>l\u00e4nder</em> elections, the CSU\u2019s result was its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/14/bavaria-poll-humiliation-for-angela-merkel-conservative-allies\" title=\"\">worst in more than six decades</a>, and the AfD entered the Bavarian parliament for the first time.</p> <p>The AfD\u2019s rise removed the raison d\u2019etre of the CDU-CSU alliance. But that alliance cannot be broken up without triggering new elections that neither Germany nor Europe can afford. And the ruling coalition cannot be robustly pro-European while facing the AfD threat.</p> <p>The situation is far from hopeless. The German Greens have emerged as the only consistently pro-European party in the country, and they continue to rise in opinion polls, whereas the AfD seems to have reached its high point (except in the former East Germany). But now CDU/CSU voters are represented by a party whose commitment to European values is ambivalent.</p> <p>In the United Kingdom too an antiquated party structure prevents the popular will from finding proper expression. Both Labour and the Conservatives are internally divided, but their leaders, Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May, respectively, are determined to deliver <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/12/un-big-mess-how-rest-of-europe-views-brexit\" title=\"\">Brexit</a>. The situation is so complicated that most Britons just want to get it over with, although it will be the defining event for the country for decades to come.</p> <p>Collusion between Corbyn and May has aroused opposition in both parties, which in the case of Labour is bordering on rebellion. May has announced a programme to aid impoverished pro-Brexit Labour constituencies in the north of England. And Corbyn is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/02/corbyn-tells-may-to-strike-new-brexit-deal-labour-can-back\" title=\"\">accused of betraying</a> the pledge he made at Labour\u2019s last party conference to back a second Brexit referendum if he can\u2019t trigger a general election.</p> <p>The chances that May\u2019s deal will again be rejected by MPs are growing by the day. That could set in motion a groundswell of support for a referendum \u2013 or, even better, for revoking Britain\u2019s article 50 notification.</p> <p>Italy finds itself in a similar predicament. The EU made a fatal mistake in 2017 by strictly enforcing the Dublin agreement, which unfairly burdens countries, such as Italy, where migrants first enter the EU. This drove its predominantly pro-European and pro-immigration electorate into the arms of the anti-European League party and Five Star Movement in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/mar/05/italian-elections-2018-full-results-renzi-berlusconi\" title=\"\">last year\u2019s election</a>. The previously dominant Democratic party is in disarray. As a result, the many voters who remain pro-European have no party to vote for. There is, however, an attempt to organise a united pro-European list. A similar reordering of party systems is happening in France, Poland and Sweden.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/28/how-rising-populism-could-shake-up-european-elections\">How rising populism could shake up European elections</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When it comes to trans-European alliances, the situation is even worse. National parties at least have some roots in the past, but these alliances are entirely dictated by party leaders\u2019 self-interest. The European People\u2019s party (EPP) alliance is the worst offender \u2013 almost entirely devoid of principles, as demonstrated by its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/05/eu-centre-right-bloc-accused-of-sheltering-hungarys-orban\" title=\"\">willingness to embrace</a> Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party in order to preserve its majority and control the allocation of top EU jobs. Anti-European forces may look good in comparison: at least they have some principles, even if they are odious.</p> <p>It is difficult to see how the pro-EU parties can emerge victorious from the May elections unless they put Europe\u2019s interests ahead of their own. One can still make a case for preserving the EU in order radically to reinvent it. But that would require a change of heart within the EU. The current leadership is reminiscent of the politburo when the Soviet Union collapsed \u2013 continuing to issue edicts as if they were still relevant.</p> <p>The first step to defending Europe from its enemies, both internal and external, is to recognise the magnitude of the threat they present. The second is to awaken the sleeping pro-European majority and mobilise it to defend the values on which the EU was founded. Otherwise, the dream of a united Europe could become a 21st-century nightmare.</p> <p>\u2022 George Soros is the chairman of Soros Fund Management and of the Open Society Foundations</p> <p>A version of this article has also appeared on Project Syndicate</p>",

      "bodyText": "Europe is sleepwalking into oblivion and its people need to wake up before it is too late. If they don\u2019t, the European Union will go the way of the Soviet Union in 1991. Neither our leaders nor ordinary citizens seem to understand that we are experiencing a revolutionary moment, that the range of possibilities is very broad, and that the eventual outcome is thus highly uncertain. Most of us assume the future will more or less resemble the present, but this is not necessarily so. In a long and eventful life, I have witnessed many periods of what I call radical disequilibrium. We are living in such a period today. The next inflection point will be the elections for the European parliament, in May 2019. Unfortunately, anti-EU forces will enjoy a competitive advantage. There are several reasons for this, including the outdated party system in most European countries, the practical impossibility of treaty change and the lack of legal tools for disciplining member states that violate the principles on which the EU was founded. The EU can impose its laws on applicant countries but it lacks sufficient capacity to enforce member states\u2019 compliance. The antiquated party system hampers those who want to preserve the values on which the EU was founded, but it helps those who want to replace those values with something radically different. This is true in individual countries and even more so in trans-European alliances. The party system of individual states reflects the divisions that mattered in the 19th and 20th centuries, such as the conflict between capital and labour. But the cleavage that matters most today is between pro- and anti-European forces. The EU\u2019s dominant country is Germany, whose dominant political alliance \u2013 between the Christian Democratic Union and the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union \u2013 has become unsustainable. The alliance worked as long as there was no significant party in Bavaria to the right of the CSU. That changed with the rise of the extremist Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD). In last September\u2019s l\u00e4nder elections, the CSU\u2019s result was its worst in more than six decades, and the AfD entered the Bavarian parliament for the first time. The AfD\u2019s rise removed the raison d\u2019etre of the CDU-CSU alliance. But that alliance cannot be broken up without triggering new elections that neither Germany nor Europe can afford. And the ruling coalition cannot be robustly pro-European while facing the AfD threat. The situation is far from hopeless. The German Greens have emerged as the only consistently pro-European party in the country, and they continue to rise in opinion polls, whereas the AfD seems to have reached its high point (except in the former East Germany). But now CDU/CSU voters are represented by a party whose commitment to European values is ambivalent. In the United Kingdom too an antiquated party structure prevents the popular will from finding proper expression. Both Labour and the Conservatives are internally divided, but their leaders, Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May, respectively, are determined to deliver Brexit. The situation is so complicated that most Britons just want to get it over with, although it will be the defining event for the country for decades to come. Collusion between Corbyn and May has aroused opposition in both parties, which in the case of Labour is bordering on rebellion. May has announced a programme to aid impoverished pro-Brexit Labour constituencies in the north of England. And Corbyn is accused of betraying the pledge he made at Labour\u2019s last party conference to back a second Brexit referendum if he can\u2019t trigger a general election. The chances that May\u2019s deal will again be rejected by MPs are growing by the day. That could set in motion a groundswell of support for a referendum \u2013 or, even better, for revoking Britain\u2019s article 50 notification. Italy finds itself in a similar predicament. The EU made a fatal mistake in 2017 by strictly enforcing the Dublin agreement, which unfairly burdens countries, such as Italy, where migrants first enter the EU. This drove its predominantly pro-European and pro-immigration electorate into the arms of the anti-European League party and Five Star Movement in last year\u2019s election. The previously dominant Democratic party is in disarray. As a result, the many voters who remain pro-European have no party to vote for. There is, however, an attempt to organise a united pro-European list. A similar reordering of party systems is happening in France, Poland and Sweden. When it comes to trans-European alliances, the situation is even worse. National parties at least have some roots in the past, but these alliances are entirely dictated by party leaders\u2019 self-interest. The European People\u2019s party (EPP) alliance is the worst offender \u2013 almost entirely devoid of principles, as demonstrated by its willingness to embrace Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party in order to preserve its majority and control the allocation of top EU jobs. Anti-European forces may look good in comparison: at least they have some principles, even if they are odious. It is difficult to see how the pro-EU parties can emerge victorious from the May elections unless they put Europe\u2019s interests ahead of their own. One can still make a case for preserving the EU in order radically to reinvent it. But that would require a change of heart within the EU. The current leadership is reminiscent of the politburo when the Soviet Union collapsed \u2013 continuing to issue edicts as if they were still relevant. The first step to defending Europe from its enemies, both internal and external, is to recognise the magnitude of the threat they present. The second is to awaken the sleeping pro-European majority and mobilise it to defend the values on which the EU was founded. Otherwise, the dream of a united Europe could become a 21st-century nightmare. \u2022 George Soros is the chairman of Soros Fund Management and of the Open Society Foundations A version of this article has also appeared on Project Syndicate",

Prosecutors have charged eight men with involvement in the ring, said to have been one of the biggest of its kind in German history.

Grime, for example, was given a home before its mainstream resurgence via Skepta and Stormzy, by programming nights such as Butterz in room three. Fabric\u2019s lineups and series of mixes document the evolution of electronic music, from minimal techno to dubstep and disco, and from drum\u2019n\u2019bass and breakbeat to all shades of house \u2013 deep, tech, ghetto, bassline and beyond. The club also championed LGBTQI culture, giving over its space to large-scale queer parties such as WetYourSelf! and Little Gay Brother on Sundays.</p> <p>Fabric\u2019s importance as a music institution came into sharper focus in 2016, when two drug-related deaths forced its closure. The subsequent campaign to overturn that decision raised \u00a3333,568, with over 160,000 signees on a petition to save the club. That snowballed into a wider #SaveOurCulture hashtag to raise awareness of the overall erosion of nightlife venues. Fabric settled its case before the appeal proceedings began and reopened in January 2017 under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/21/fabric-nightclub-to-reopen-under-strict-new-licensing-conditions\">a set of 32 new licensing conditions</a>.

Those laws are, he says, \u201cdeeply flawed. I\u2019m not just talking about Fabric \u2013 I\u2019m talking about any fixed club that has to be open 52 weeks a year to pay its bills.\u201d With \u201chuge business rates [and] <a href=\"https://www.hackney.gov.uk/article/4622/Late-night-levy\">the late-night levy taxes on venues like ours</a> [which came into effect in November 2017]\u201d, in order \u201cto keep a high quality management staff that is able to operate a complex business within the licensing laws\u201d, running a club is, he says, \u201ccompletely different to how it was 10 years ago, or certainly 20 years ago when we started.</p> <p>\u201cBizarrely, we\u2019re under no different scrutiny than we were prior to closure,\u201d he says, it\u2019s just that running a club has \u201cbecome more complex because the operating costs and the margins have got so squeezed.\u201d As a result of overheads like these, he admits \u2013 as well as licensing restrictions that include a new over-19s policy, \u201cyou have to strike that balance between putting lineups on that you are confident are going to be able to pay the bills,\u201d and \u201cthe ones you feel are important even if they aren\u2019t obvious.\u201d</p> <p>The music that the club announced for their 20th birthday certainly felt, in one way, like a curveball: blokey Ibiza-famous tech-house mainstays such as Tale of Us and the Martinez Brothers, who arguably blunt the edge that Fabric is known for. The club also drew criticism for the stunt to launch its 20th birthday celebrations, for which they painted the front of the club black and deleted its social media account. It could easily have been interpreted as tasteless, considering there were fears it had been shut all over again, although Leslie says a statement was necessary, to \u201ccut through the noise\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cf9231cb3100fdfe6b6a5c4ad9a0829dc3414511\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf9231cb3100fdfe6b6a5c4ad9a0829dc3414511/0_0_2048_1368/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New blood ... recently appointed Fabric nightclub resident Anna Wall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New blood ... recently appointed Fabric nightclub resident Anna Wall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Ensing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stunts aside, however, it would be naive to expect a club that is open all year to survive on acceptably cool lineups alone. \u201cA lot of the underground nights that we were known for, they\u2019re not so well-attended now,\u201d Griffith says, adding that clubbers now \u201cdon\u2019t want to take the risk\u201d on unknown DJs. \u201cWe have to mix it up a lot more in order to survive. We want to still be here in 10 years\u2019 time.\u201d</p> <p>Griffith says that the six Sunday nighters they\u2019ve confirmed so far are only \u201cphase one\u201d of the birthday announcement, which they are planning to roll out in 2019. They\u2019re also nurturing new DJs in their arsenal of residents, including Anna Wall and Bobby, to continue the spirit of, as Griffith puts it, \u201cchampioning the underdog\u201d.</p> <p>To survive, the club will need future generations to be drawn to it every single weekend, beyond the occasional back-to-back set between Craig Richards and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/10/ricardo-villalobos-techno-music-melds-the-classes-together\">Ricardo Villalobos</a> (a thing of nightlife legend). And while they don\u2019t have a clear answer for how to do that, they do at least seem to be starting them off young. \u201cI was in the other Sunday for an event called Big Fish Little Fish,\u201d says Francis, \u201cand there was all these people in there with kids on their shoulders, like a proper kids\u2019 rave.

It was a huge moment having him contribute to the mix series \u2013 it was the only mix he ever released, and he was someone whose taste we were all influenced by. Every artist on the series traditionally plays at the club to launch the album \u2013 we had to do a bit of convincing as he wasn\u2019t much of a club DJ but eventually we got him to agree. As on Fabriclive 07, he closed with Teenage Kicks, the crowd started chanting his name, and carried him out of the room on their shoulders. It was as spectacular as it sounds.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Ricardo Villalobos:</strong><strong> Dexter</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0i1Szq6GM8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h0i1Szq6GM8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Christian Williams: \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to pick one track that could sum up Ricardo\u2019s history with us, but Dexter will always have a special room one feeling to it. It came out on Ricardo\u2019s groundbreaking debut album <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8506-alcachofa/\">Alcachofa</a> in 2003, around a year after we\u2019d first invited him to the club. European minimal wasn\u2019t such a big thing in the UK at this point \u2013 Craig Richards had also started to introduce the sound in his sets, but it wasn\u2019t something the London audience was used to. Ricardo came back to play a number of times over the next year, marking the start of his relationship with us. By the time Alcachofa was released some months later, the world had discovered a new electronic music star.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Convextion:</strong><strong> Premiata</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TM05n3H9JY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8TM05n3H9JY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Craig Richards, music director: \u201cAfter 20 years it\u2019s impossible for me to pick just one tune that represents the sound of Fabric. Closing room one is one of the most rewarding DJ experiences imaginable. The combination of vinyl, a warm rotary mixer, a killer sound system and an attentive audience allowed me freedom and confidence in my work. I chose this track because it truly represents the early morning sound of Fabric. I have never stopped playing it. It is a timeless piece of deep electro techno music, which still sounds like the future.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Schatrax:</strong><strong> Mispent Years</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKnzVW9jJDc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UKnzVW9jJDc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Anna Wall, Fabric resident: \u201cI was too young to be raving when this came out, but it was the last track on Craig Richards\u2019s Fabric 01 mix and it\u2019s one I still play today. It\u2019s these kinds of records that I imagine embodied what was going on in the club\u2019s early years \u2013 that proper UK style of house and techno that was being pioneered by Craig and Terry \u2013 and it\u2019s a sound that still influences me today. When I see DJs like Craig playing at Fabric pulling out old records \u2013 many I\u2019ve never come across before \u2013 I feel like I\u2019m constantly learning. Tunes from the 90s and early 2000s always come back around. I love that Fabric is constantly evolving, bringing in new artists and ideas, while still being a club where classic records remain commonplace.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

It was a huge moment having him contribute to the mix series \u2013 it was the only mix he ever released, and he was someone whose taste we were all influenced by. Every artist on the series traditionally plays at the club to launch the album \u2013 we had to do a bit of convincing as he wasn\u2019t much of a club DJ but eventually we got him to agree. As on Fabriclive 07, he closed with Teenage Kicks, the crowd started chanting his name, and carried him out of the room on their shoulders. It was as spectacular as it sounds.\u201d Ricardo Villalobos: Dexter Christian Williams: \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to pick one track that could sum up Ricardo\u2019s history with us, but Dexter will always have a special room one feeling to it. It came out on Ricardo\u2019s groundbreaking debut album Alcachofa in 2003, around a year after we\u2019d first invited him to the club. European minimal wasn\u2019t such a big thing in the UK at this point \u2013 Craig Richards had also started to introduce the sound in his sets, but it wasn\u2019t something the London audience was used to. Ricardo came back to play a number of times over the next year, marking the start of his relationship with us. By the time Alcachofa was released some months later, the world had discovered a new electronic music star.\u201d Convextion: Premiata Craig Richards, music director: \u201cAfter 20 years it\u2019s impossible for me to pick just one tune that represents the sound of Fabric. Closing room one is one of the most rewarding DJ experiences imaginable. The combination of vinyl, a warm rotary mixer, a killer sound system and an attentive audience allowed me freedom and confidence in my work. I chose this track because it truly represents the early morning sound of Fabric. I have never stopped playing it. It is a timeless piece of deep electro techno music, which still sounds like the future.\u201d Schatrax: Mispent Years Anna Wall, Fabric resident: \u201cI was too young to be raving when this came out, but it was the last track on Craig Richards\u2019s Fabric 01 mix and it\u2019s one I still play today. It\u2019s these kinds of records that I imagine embodied what was going on in the club\u2019s early years \u2013 that proper UK style of house and techno that was being pioneered by Craig and Terry \u2013 and it\u2019s a sound that still influences me today. When I see DJs like Craig playing at Fabric pulling out old records \u2013 many I\u2019ve never come across before \u2013 I feel like I\u2019m constantly learning. Tunes from the 90s and early 2000s always come back around. I love that Fabric is constantly evolving, bringing in new artists and ideas, while still being a club where classic records remain commonplace.\u201d",

Paid employment is held up as one of the ultimate markers of being a valuable member of society, with those not in paid work (always described in these narratives as a voluntary position, rather than as the result of issues outside their control) seen as a drain on society. Those out of work are positioned in direct contrast to those in paid employment: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jan/08/strivers-shirkers-language-welfare\" title=\"\">shirkers versus the strivers</a>, the \u201cwelfare dependent\u201d versus the hardworking families.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/08/finland-free-cash-experiment-fails-to-boost-employment\">Finland's 'free cash' experiment fails to boost employment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For those in paid work, working hard and being constantly busy are worn as a badge of pride, and there are whole industries promising to make us more productive and efficient. For some, hard work is enforced through workplace monitoring, impossibly short breaks or expectations of staff being \u201calways on\u201d, for example responding to emails outside work hours. Work is idealised as providing meaning in our lives, while at the same time removing us from other sources of meaning, such as family, friends and our communities, through long hours and unpaid overtime. The negative psychological, social and physical effects of these narratives and assumptions are now being investigated, and the centrality of work in our lives and society questioned.</p> <p>Preliminary results from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/08/finland-free-cash-experiment-fails-to-boost-employment\" title=\"\">Finland\u2019s basic income experiment</a> found little to no impact on recipients\u2019 likelihood of undertaking paid employment. This has led some to suggest that the experiment is a failure \u2013 indeed, the Finnish government had hoped the plan would increase participation in paid work. However, although it was not a trial of a full UBI (universal, unconditional, non-withdrawable and non means-tested) it is being celebrated by many who advocate the idea, as it provides important evidence about the interaction of UBI and work. One of the major objections is that getting \u201cfree money\u201d would undermine recipients\u2019 motivation to undertake paid work: the Finnish case shows this is not so.</p> <p>The notion that paid employment is the cure to all ills has been seriously undermined, if it were ever true. Work as the best route out of poverty may still hold true for some, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/22/record-britons-in-work-poverty-families-study-private-rented-housing\" title=\"\">majority of households in poverty</a> in the UK are now consistently those with at least one person in work. The likelihood of people becoming stuck in low-wage, low-skilled work is significant, and hard work among the lower paid is doing nothing to reduce economic inequalities. Coupled with the potential threat to many jobs and industries from automation and AI (although we need to be careful not to overstate this), the relentless prioritisation of paid work seems less defensible.</p> <p>Whether we derive meaning from employment, or find ourselves engaged in meaningless \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/25/bullshit-jobs-a-theory-by-david-graeber-review\" title=\"\">bullshit jobs</a>\u201d as David Graeber suggests, we cannot deny that the world of work is changing. Climate change, mass migration and continued technological change will all have impacts on what \u201cwork\u201d means and looks like in ways that we cannot accurately predict.</p> <p>For its proponents, a UBI can provide a lifejacket and a route through some of these challenges. A UBI could provide a stable income floor, a guaranteed minimum below which no one would fall. Depending on the amount paid, it could enable low-paid workers to turn down the worst jobs on offer, or enable time away from paid work to retrain, or start a business. It would financially compensate those (usually women) caring for family for their work, support more people to be creative, to volunteer, or simply to do nothing. In the US, proposals for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/11/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ed-markey\" title=\"\">Green New Deal</a> led by Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey appear to advocate for something like a UBI \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/07/ocasio-cortezs-green-new-deal-offers-economic-security-for-those-unwilling-to-work.html\" title=\"\">potentially for those \u201cunwilling\u201d to work</a>, although it is light on detail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/07/universal-basic-income-rich-finland-work-benefits\">Universal basic income hasn\u2019t made me rich. But my life is more enriching | Tuomas Muraja</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A UBI is not designed to promote \u201claziness\u201d or any other type of behaviour, simply to allow individuals to make their own decisions about how they wish to spend their time. The pure idea of a UBI does not hold any inherent position when it comes to paid work, but promises freedom and choice. As far back as the 1880s, <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/lafargue/1883/lazy/\" title=\"\">in the work of Paul Lafargue</a>, the right of workers (as opposed to the rich) to be lazy was framed as an explicit rejection of the dominant work ethic, and the route to true independence, free from the pressure to work. The refusal to participate in paid employment is still considered by some as an active strategy of resistance to neoliberalism. A UBI as a way to live securely without paid employment features regularly in mainly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/19/post-work-the-radical-idea-of-a-world-without-jobs\" title=\"\">leftwing discussions about post-work</a>, interrogating the centrality of paid employment in our lives and societies, and our ability to liberate ourselves, or be liberated from, our roles as paid workers.</p> <p>In reality, the likelihood of any western country introducing a UBI at a rate to enable the average worker to entirely opt out of paid employment is extremely low (in Finland, participants received <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2018/jan/12/money-for-nothing-is-finlands-universal-basic-income-trial-too-good-to-be-true\" title=\"\">\u20ac560 (\u00a3475) a month</a>, in Ontario, participants were guaranteed a minimum income of <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/what-is-basic-income-and-who-qualifies/article34795127/\" title=\"\">$16,989 (\u00a313,185) a year</a>). Most of the current trials around the world actively frame UBI as a pro-employment policy, smoothing the sharp edges of benefit systems and the insecurities of the modern labour market, to make paid employment more feasible, attractive and sustainable. The utopian vision of a life of leisure in which a UBI offers us a comfortable standard of living is not about to become reality, but the ideas of working less, and receiving a stable, humane basic income are gaining traction and starting to influence debate in ways unthinkable even 10 years ago.</p> <p>\u2022 Anna Dent is a freelance policy and research consultant</p>",

      "bodyText": "The danger of so-called \u201cfree money\u201d not only underpins critiques of universal basic income (UBI), but also the incredibly strong narratives that underlie the attitudes to work in the UK (and elsewhere) \u2013 and our unemployment benefit system. Paid employment is held up as one of the ultimate markers of being a valuable member of society, with those not in paid work (always described in these narratives as a voluntary position, rather than as the result of issues outside their control) seen as a drain on society. Those out of work are positioned in direct contrast to those in paid employment: the shirkers versus the strivers, the \u201cwelfare dependent\u201d versus the hardworking families. For those in paid work, working hard and being constantly busy are worn as a badge of pride, and there are whole industries promising to make us more productive and efficient. For some, hard work is enforced through workplace monitoring, impossibly short breaks or expectations of staff being \u201calways on\u201d, for example responding to emails outside work hours. Work is idealised as providing meaning in our lives, while at the same time removing us from other sources of meaning, such as family, friends and our communities, through long hours and unpaid overtime. The negative psychological, social and physical effects of these narratives and assumptions are now being investigated, and the centrality of work in our lives and society questioned. Preliminary results from Finland\u2019s basic income experiment found little to no impact on recipients\u2019 likelihood of undertaking paid employment. This has led some to suggest that the experiment is a failure \u2013 indeed, the Finnish government had hoped the plan would increase participation in paid work. However, although it was not a trial of a full UBI (universal, unconditional, non-withdrawable and non means-tested) it is being celebrated by many who advocate the idea, as it provides important evidence about the interaction of UBI and work. One of the major objections is that getting \u201cfree money\u201d would undermine recipients\u2019 motivation to undertake paid work: the Finnish case shows this is not so. The notion that paid employment is the cure to all ills has been seriously undermined, if it were ever true. Work as the best route out of poverty may still hold true for some, but the majority of households in poverty in the UK are now consistently those with at least one person in work. The likelihood of people becoming stuck in low-wage, low-skilled work is significant, and hard work among the lower paid is doing nothing to reduce economic inequalities. Coupled with the potential threat to many jobs and industries from automation and AI (although we need to be careful not to overstate this), the relentless prioritisation of paid work seems less defensible. Whether we derive meaning from employment, or find ourselves engaged in meaningless \u201cbullshit jobs\u201d as David Graeber suggests, we cannot deny that the world of work is changing. Climate change, mass migration and continued technological change will all have impacts on what \u201cwork\u201d means and looks like in ways that we cannot accurately predict. For its proponents, a UBI can provide a lifejacket and a route through some of these challenges. A UBI could provide a stable income floor, a guaranteed minimum below which no one would fall. Depending on the amount paid, it could enable low-paid workers to turn down the worst jobs on offer, or enable time away from paid work to retrain, or start a business. It would financially compensate those (usually women) caring for family for their work, support more people to be creative, to volunteer, or simply to do nothing. In the US, proposals for a Green New Deal led by Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey appear to advocate for something like a UBI \u2013 potentially for those \u201cunwilling\u201d to work, although it is light on detail. A UBI is not designed to promote \u201claziness\u201d or any other type of behaviour, simply to allow individuals to make their own decisions about how they wish to spend their time. The pure idea of a UBI does not hold any inherent position when it comes to paid work, but promises freedom and choice. As far back as the 1880s, in the work of Paul Lafargue, the right of workers (as opposed to the rich) to be lazy was framed as an explicit rejection of the dominant work ethic, and the route to true independence, free from the pressure to work. The refusal to participate in paid employment is still considered by some as an active strategy of resistance to neoliberalism. A UBI as a way to live securely without paid employment features regularly in mainly leftwing discussions about post-work, interrogating the centrality of paid employment in our lives and societies, and our ability to liberate ourselves, or be liberated from, our roles as paid workers. In reality, the likelihood of any western country introducing a UBI at a rate to enable the average worker to entirely opt out of paid employment is extremely low (in Finland, participants received \u20ac560 (\u00a3475) a month, in Ontario, participants were guaranteed a minimum income of $16,989 (\u00a313,185) a year). Most of the current trials around the world actively frame UBI as a pro-employment policy, smoothing the sharp edges of benefit systems and the insecurities of the modern labour market, to make paid employment more feasible, attractive and sustainable. The utopian vision of a life of leisure in which a UBI offers us a comfortable standard of living is not about to become reality, but the ideas of working less, and receiving a stable, humane basic income are gaining traction and starting to influence debate in ways unthinkable even 10 years ago. \u2022 Anna Dent is a freelance policy and research consultant",

While these jobs are nowhere near as glamorous or well-paid as fans might imagine, they pay the rent and there are only a few available at the top of the game. It is implausible that Bajin was the one to walk.</p> \n<p>It could be that Osaka hired Bajin in the first place to pick his brains about Serena Williams, with whom he worked as a hitting partner for seven years \u2013 and it certainly paid an early dividend when she beat the 23-slam champion in straight sets in Miami last year, before working her way through the schedule to upset her again (in more ways than one) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/08/serena-williams-rails-at-umpire-as-superb-naomi-osaka-wins-us-open\" title=\"\">in the final of the US Open</a>. After a minor dip in form, Osaka followed that breakthrough by winning the Australian Open, becoming the first back-to-back champion since the American herself, in 2015 \u2013 and the first debutant winner to double up since Jennifer Capriati in 2001.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e717bf00-f1d1-4e06-8f30-6a5cc39ac74a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uEcVKW1tuto?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Osaka\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Naomi_Osaka_/status/1095064722293096448\" title=\"\">sign-off for Bajin</a> was blunt and to the point: \u201cHey everyone, I will no longer be working together with Sascha. I thank him for his work and wish him all the best in the future.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bajin responded: \u201cThank you Naomi. I wish you nothing but the best as well. What a ride that was. Thank you for letting me be part of this.\u201d</p> \n<p>There had been no hint of a breakup when Bajin spoke on his own terms in Melbourne. Nor did it seem as if their attitude to training was miles apart. \u201cWe had an unbelievable, great season last year,\u201d he said, \u201cbut, after having just two weeks\u2019 break, she came back and showed up and really worked her butt off. She\u2019s a hard worker. That\u2019s why she\u2019s here.\u201d</p> \n<p>As for methodology and tactics, they also worked on the same page. \u201cFrom the very beginning, she was a big hitter. I didn\u2019t have to teach her how to hit the ball. Maybe it was a little bit more like telling her there are other things out there than just hitting very hard. We worked on her angles, slicing. I wanted her to come in a little bit more.\u201d And she did, to great effect in a tense three-set final against Petra Kvitova.</p> \n<p>Bajin spoke warmly, too, about Osaka\u2019s level-headedness. \u201cShe\u2019s still the same,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty about her. She\u2019s still the same girl that she was even a year ago. In my mind, at least, she didn\u2019t change. Maybe she\u2019s a little bit more open to you guys, used to more crowds and questions. Maybe on court she\u2019s more confident, just good things. She\u2019s still the same girl.\u201d</p> \n<p>And he told the Women\u2019s Tennis Association website in a one-on-one interview last August: \u201cI believe in longevity and that if you work with someone for a longer period of time you can work more efficiently.\u201d</p> \n<p>That did not seem to hold much traction with Osaka who, for all her charm, looks to be a hard-headed professional also. She has had the benefit of a wide range of advice in her career, from her father, Leonard Fran\u00e7ois, when she was a young teenager, followed by Patrick Tauma until 2013, the former top-five player Harold Solomon the following year, then David Taylor, who made way for Bajin towards the end of a low-key 2017 campaign.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc875de2912e62684b4b660d314ddba05d0498a0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc875de2912e62684b4b660d314ddba05d0498a0/286_29_2782_1669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bajin and Osaka\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sascha Bajin said of Naomi Osaka after the Australian Open: \u2018She\u2019s still the same girl that she was even a year ago.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Baker/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Bajin, a light-hearted joker on her humour wavelength, appeared to be the perfect foil for the most precocious talent in women\u2019s tennis, but there is a culture of short-termism in the player-coach relationship and he will not have been entirely thunderstruck. He said when named coach of the year last season: \u201cEasy to be a good coach when you have a great student.\u201d</p> \n<p>Permanence throughout tennis seems very much a thing of the distant past, especially in the women\u2019s game where all of the current grand slam champions have since parted with their coaches. There is even an unofficial clearout window towards the end of year, which Jo Konta, who is enjoying renewed success with her latest coach, Dimitri Zavialoff, talked about recently.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt could be a bit of timing with that many changes,\u201d she said. \u201cFor example, with Simona [Halep] and Darren [Cahill], they had been together for years and years and, from what I hear about that split, he wanted to spend some more time at home. They seem very close still.

      "bodyText": "Naomi Osaka splitting with her coach, Sascha Bajin, after little more than a year and two grand slam triumphs together shocked many people in tennis but, if the world No 1 wants no more than to explore new strategies and schedules, it could lift her even further away from her rivals. They announced the divorce on Twitter on Monday and have issued no statements since. The Japanese media are speculating they started to grow apart towards the end of the Australian Open last month, claiming she did not agree with some of his ideas and even practised alone, but that did not appear to be the case at the time, as she powered on to her second slam title in a row at just 21, with his happy endorsement. Another suspicion is that the beguiling Japanese prodigy could have suffered an early dose of the celebrity virus, after rising 72 places in the rankings in less than 12 months and being paraded as the bright new face of tennis, with endorsements showering down on her after winning her second slam title. Whatever the reason, it will be a nailed-on certainty it was Osaka\u2019s call. While these jobs are nowhere near as glamorous or well-paid as fans might imagine, they pay the rent and there are only a few available at the top of the game. It is implausible that Bajin was the one to walk. It could be that Osaka hired Bajin in the first place to pick his brains about Serena Williams, with whom he worked as a hitting partner for seven years \u2013 and it certainly paid an early dividend when she beat the 23-slam champion in straight sets in Miami last year, before working her way through the schedule to upset her again (in more ways than one) in the final of the US Open. After a minor dip in form, Osaka followed that breakthrough by winning the Australian Open, becoming the first back-to-back champion since the American herself, in 2015 \u2013 and the first debutant winner to double up since Jennifer Capriati in 2001. Osaka\u2019s sign-off for Bajin was blunt and to the point: \u201cHey everyone, I will no longer be working together with Sascha. I thank him for his work and wish him all the best in the future.\u201d Bajin responded: \u201cThank you Naomi. I wish you nothing but the best as well. What a ride that was. Thank you for letting me be part of this.\u201d There had been no hint of a breakup when Bajin spoke on his own terms in Melbourne. Nor did it seem as if their attitude to training was miles apart. \u201cWe had an unbelievable, great season last year,\u201d he said, \u201cbut, after having just two weeks\u2019 break, she came back and showed up and really worked her butt off. She\u2019s a hard worker. That\u2019s why she\u2019s here.\u201d As for methodology and tactics, they also worked on the same page. \u201cFrom the very beginning, she was a big hitter. I didn\u2019t have to teach her how to hit the ball. Maybe it was a little bit more like telling her there are other things out there than just hitting very hard. We worked on her angles, slicing. I wanted her to come in a little bit more.\u201d And she did, to great effect in a tense three-set final against Petra Kvitova. Bajin spoke warmly, too, about Osaka\u2019s level-headedness. \u201cShe\u2019s still the same,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty about her. She\u2019s still the same girl that she was even a year ago. In my mind, at least, she didn\u2019t change. Maybe she\u2019s a little bit more open to you guys, used to more crowds and questions. Maybe on court she\u2019s more confident, just good things. She\u2019s still the same girl.\u201d And he told the Women\u2019s Tennis Association website in a one-on-one interview last August: \u201cI believe in longevity and that if you work with someone for a longer period of time you can work more efficiently.\u201d That did not seem to hold much traction with Osaka who, for all her charm, looks to be a hard-headed professional also. She has had the benefit of a wide range of advice in her career, from her father, Leonard Fran\u00e7ois, when she was a young teenager, followed by Patrick Tauma until 2013, the former top-five player Harold Solomon the following year, then David Taylor, who made way for Bajin towards the end of a low-key 2017 campaign. Bajin, a light-hearted joker on her humour wavelength, appeared to be the perfect foil for the most precocious talent in women\u2019s tennis, but there is a culture of short-termism in the player-coach relationship and he will not have been entirely thunderstruck. He said when named coach of the year last season: \u201cEasy to be a good coach when you have a great student.\u201d Permanence throughout tennis seems very much a thing of the distant past, especially in the women\u2019s game where all of the current grand slam champions have since parted with their coaches. There is even an unofficial clearout window towards the end of year, which Jo Konta, who is enjoying renewed success with her latest coach, Dimitri Zavialoff, talked about recently. \u201cIt could be a bit of timing with that many changes,\u201d she said. \u201cFor example, with Simona [Halep] and Darren [Cahill], they had been together for years and years and, from what I hear about that split, he wanted to spend some more time at home. They seem very close still. There were quite a few changes last year.\u201d And now Osaka is alone at the top of the mountain, for the time being at least, doing it her way. GB face Kazakhstan in Fed Cup Great Britain have landed a home tie against Kazakhstan in the Fed Cup World Group II play-off. The GB captain, Anne Keothavong, was desperately hoping for another home tie and got her wish in Tuesday\u2019s draw. Britain booked their place in April\u2019s play-off after a dramatic Europe/Africa Zone Group 1 win over Serbia at the University of Bath on Saturday. It was Britain\u2019s first home Fed Cup tie since 1993. Keothavong said: \u201cWords cannot describe how happy we are to be drawn at home. We all saw last week the fantastic atmosphere home fans create and the role they play in lifting our players beyond their limits. This will be something for everyone to look forward to and I hope the team can do their part to inspire more people to take up the game.\u201dPA",

Mullery came to England\u2019s rescue then, sweeping the ball away from Pele. Labone held the threat from Tostao, and once again England were thankful to Moore for his cool, commanding generalship. But the forwards could not get going often enough, and England\u2019s passing was not as accurate as might have been expected on an occasion of such importance.</p> <p>The Brazilians need not have worried about the comparative inexperience of Piazza and Brito, the centre-backs. They thwarted Hurst, and Peters was seldom able to make his ghost-like runs on the blind side. Lee, who tried to bustle through, on one occasion having a good chance half smothered by Felix, and Bobby Charlton, who worked himself almost to a standstill in the middle of the field, were replaced by Bell and Astle immediately after the Brazilians had scored.</p> <h2>Chances missed</h2> <p>It was then that the two England chances came and were lost forever. England were efficient, but they were against something intangible, a method \u2013 if method it be called \u2013 where unexpectedly graceful, yet deceptive moves suddenly built into moments of great danger. So was the goal built on the hour. Rivellino linked with Tostao, who beat three men before passing to Pele. The ball was sent to Jairzinho, and England were beaten. The move was so simple, but simplicity is often devastating.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/30/carlos-alberto-goal-brazil-1970-world-cup-final\">Carlos Alberto and the goal that defined Brazil to the rest of the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The build-up to the match bad begun in the early hours with disturbances by Mexican and Brazilian supporters at England\u2019s hotel which caused sleepless hours. Today, the packed stadium was a cacophony, with drums banging for Brazil, and clouds could not act as a sombrero to hide fully the blazing sun.</p> <p>As early as the tenth minute, Jairzinho beat Cooper to the line, centred to Pele, and only aerobatics by Banks prevented England falling behind.</p> <p>For once Bobby Charlton heard whistles of derision directed at him as he drove the ball high over the crossbar. But he was not alone: Even in this pro-Brazilian crowd, Pele himself received the same treatment for a bad shot.</p> <p>England had their first half change after 32 minutes, from a move involving, Mullery and Wright; but Lee\u2019s shot was smothered. Lee, on the ground, tried to hook at the ball again, but succeeded only in touching the goalkeeper. Immediately, the Brazilians swarmed around, as in these parts a goalkeeper is sacrosanct. Happily, the incident passed away quietly, as did other occasions when the Brazilians tried a few histrionics each time they were impeded.</p> <p>For a time England appeared to find cracks in Brazil\u2019s defence but goals were denied the world champions.</p> <p>Paulo Cezar forced Banks to dive to turn the ball away for a corner. Then, in another quirk burst, Pele and Tostao weaved through. Again England\u2019s defensive web closed round them but on the hour, came the goal which beat England. They had to be content to walk off the field as the vanquished today. And there was no disgrace in that.</p> <p>It remains now for a great effort against the Czechs on Thursday to ensure that England qualify for the quarter-finals, even if they have to go to Leon to play. I\u2019m sure England will be only too glad to do that now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8686fa997d2012617e5b04a376c943196d480a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8686fa997d2012617e5b04a376c943196d480a3/50_63_1125_675/1000.png\" alt=\"The Guardian, 8 June 1970.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guardian, 8 June 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Rodrigues/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

Only victory over the by the Romanians and victory by England over Czechoslovakia can now make this a three-way tie in which goal difference would count. England played their hearts out in the heat and as the thunderflashes burst, and the bands played, greeting Brazil\u2019s victory, England walked off ruefully. Two great chances were missed in as many minutes only four minutes after the Brazilians had scored. The first miss was by Ball, who miskicked at a pass from Astle right in front of the goal. Then it was the turn of Astle. He failed to take advantage of a terrible defensive muddle involving Everaldo, and shot wide of an open goal. The chances were the greatest, and most costly missed, of the World Cup. Much has been said about the fragility of the Brazilian defence and on the vulnerability of Felix in goal. But it is sufficient to say that England were unable to take advantage of any leaks even though they increasingly swarmed around the Brazilian goal as the game went on, trying to force errors. The match was a battle between England\u2019s methodical defensive network, and the gifted self-expression of Pele, Tostao until he was replaced, Jairzinho, and the deadly surges up the wing of Paulo Cezar, who today took the place of Gerson, the mastermind of Brazil\u2019s attack, who was injured. No one could fault Banks. He pushed away the swerving shots at which the Brazilians are so adept, first from Paulo Cezar, and later from Roberto, the substitute for Tostao. One did not envy the task of Cooper, trying to smother Jairzinho, with Cooper trying attacks down the wing when circumstances permitted. Mullery held Pele well, as he did in Rio a year ago. But one cannot budget for genius. There was one occasion when Pele eluded the England defence, and played the ball off defenders\u2019 legs as one does a billiard ball off a cushion. Mullery came to England\u2019s rescue then, sweeping the ball away from Pele. Labone held the threat from Tostao, and once again England were thankful to Moore for his cool, commanding generalship. But the forwards could not get going often enough, and England\u2019s passing was not as accurate as might have been expected on an occasion of such importance. The Brazilians need not have worried about the comparative inexperience of Piazza and Brito, the centre-backs. They thwarted Hurst, and Peters was seldom able to make his ghost-like runs on the blind side. Lee, who tried to bustle through, on one occasion having a good chance half smothered by Felix, and Bobby Charlton, who worked himself almost to a standstill in the middle of the field, were replaced by Bell and Astle immediately after the Brazilians had scored. Chances missed It was then that the two England chances came and were lost forever. England were efficient, but they were against something intangible, a method \u2013 if method it be called \u2013 where unexpectedly graceful, yet deceptive moves suddenly built into moments of great danger. So was the goal built on the hour. Rivellino linked with Tostao, who beat three men before passing to Pele. The ball was sent to Jairzinho, and England were beaten. The move was so simple, but simplicity is often devastating. The build-up to the match bad begun in the early hours with disturbances by Mexican and Brazilian supporters at England\u2019s hotel which caused sleepless hours. Today, the packed stadium was a cacophony, with drums banging for Brazil, and clouds could not act as a sombrero to hide fully the blazing sun. As early as the tenth minute, Jairzinho beat Cooper to the line, centred to Pele, and only aerobatics by Banks prevented England falling behind. For once Bobby Charlton heard whistles of derision directed at him as he drove the ball high over the crossbar. But he was not alone: Even in this pro-Brazilian crowd, Pele himself received the same treatment for a bad shot. England had their first half change after 32 minutes, from a move involving, Mullery and Wright; but Lee\u2019s shot was smothered. Lee, on the ground, tried to hook at the ball again, but succeeded only in touching the goalkeeper. Immediately, the Brazilians swarmed around, as in these parts a goalkeeper is sacrosanct. Happily, the incident passed away quietly, as did other occasions when the Brazilians tried a few histrionics each time they were impeded. For a time England appeared to find cracks in Brazil\u2019s defence but goals were denied the world champions. Paulo Cezar forced Banks to dive to turn the ball away for a corner. Then, in another quirk burst, Pele and Tostao weaved through. Again England\u2019s defensive web closed round them but on the hour, came the goal which beat England. They had to be content to walk off the field as the vanquished today. And there was no disgrace in that. It remains now for a great effort against the Czechs on Thursday to ensure that England qualify for the quarter-finals, even if they have to go to Leon to play. I\u2019m sure England will be only too glad to do that now.",

GREETINGS (9 points)</h2> <p>The five strings of initial letters, after correction, come from:</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cA Visit from St. Nicholas\u201d aka \u201cThe Night Before Christmas\u201d (\u201c\u2018Twas the night before Christmas / When all through the house / Not a creature was stirring / Not even a mouse\u201d)</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cWe\u2019re Walking in the Air\u201d (\u201cWe\u2019re walking in the air / We\u2019re floating in the moonlit sky / The people far below are sleeping as we fly / I\u2019m holding very tight / I\u2019m riding in the midnight blue / I\u2019m finding I can fly so high above with you\u201d)</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cSilent Night\u201d (\u201cSilent night, holy night / All is calm, all is bright / Round yon virgin, mother and child / Holy infant so tender and mild / Sleep in heavenly peace / Sleep in heavenly peace\u201d)</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cFairytale of New York\u201d (specifically, verse 3: \u201cThey\u2019ve got cars big as bars, they\u2019ve got rivers of gold / But the wind goes right through you, it\u2019s no place for the old / When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve / You promised me Broadway was waiting for me\u201d)</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d (specifically, Scrooge\u2019s famous pronouncement: \u201cI am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy. I am as giddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to everybody! A happy New Year to all the world! Hallo here! Whoop! Hallo!\u201d)</p> <p>The 15 errors, in order, are HIMIWWIAATYYLTM, which are the initial letters of the opening to the song \u201cHello\u201d by Adele (\u201cHello / It\u2019s me / I was wondering if after all these years you\u2019d like to meet\u201d). This song is a particularly apt choice for the first question of the 25th anniversary quiz, as it is the first track from the album \u201c25\u201d. (The song title \u201cHello\u201d is also reflected in the question title, \u201cGreetings\u201d.)</p> <h2>Q2. BILKO (11 points)</h2> <p>All eight individuals have the initials AG:</p> <p>(a) Art Garfunkel (who performed with Paul Simon as \u201cTom &amp; Jerry\u201d)</p> <p>(b) Sir Alec Guinness (who achieved the rank of Lieutenant in World War II, played Colonel Nicholson in \u201cThe Bridge on the River Kwai\u201d, and played Obi-Wan \u201cBen\u201d Kenobi in the original Star Wars trilogy)</p> <p>(c) Antony Gormley (who created the sculpture \u201cAngel of the North\u201d, which features in \u201cTravelling in a Strange Land\u201d by David Park)</p> <p>(d) Anna Gunn (who famously played Skyler White in Breaking Bad)</p> <p>(e) Antoine Griezmann (who won the 2018 Fifa World Cup with France while wearing the number seven shirt, and was also awarded the Silver Boot and Bronze Ball)</p> <p>(f) Al Gore (who was the 45th vice-president of the USA, four after Nelson Rockefeller)</p> <p>(g) Amy Grant (born in Augusta, whose golf course hosts the Masters \u2013 one of golf\u2019s \u201cmajors\u201d \u2013 and has an 18th hole called \u201cHolly\u201d)</p> <p>(h) Ali G (the satirical character created by Sacha Baron Cohen).</p> <p>Art Garfunkel and Amy Grant have previously collaborated \u2013 the context being, appropriately, a Christmas album called \u201cThe Animals\u2019 Christmas\u201d. They are labelled (a) and (g) in the above list \u2013 another juxtaposition of those two letters.</p> <p>As many solvers noted, AG is a particularly appropriate choice for the common set of initials because Ag is the chemical symbol for Silver \u2013 traditionally associated with a 25th anniversary. Collectively, the eight answers in this question might therefore be described as \u201cSilvers\u201d \u2013 this explains the question title \u201cBILKO\u201d, since Phil Silvers famously played (Sergeant) Bilko on \u201cThe Phil Silvers Show\u201d (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phil_Silvers_Show\">The Phil Silvers Show</a>).</p> <h2>Q3. TOM, DICK, AND\u2026 (7 points)</h2> <p>The person is \u201cCBABBAGE\u201d \u2013 i.e. Charles Babbage, the world-famous computer pioneer. All of the letters in the message are notes of the musical scale, and the symbols given in the question show how to play these notes on a four-hole ocarina (as hinted at by the word \u201cblow\u201d in the first sentence). The following diagram (which is available online at <a href=\"http://forbiddenislandflutes.com/how-to-play\">this website</a>) illustrates this system of notation \u2013 and it can be readily seen that the message in the question image corresponds to \u201cCBABBAGE\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b582d63bb50c0b4c33ff3d38f6093ed2fc5add9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b582d63bb50c0b4c33ff3d38f6093ed2fc5add9f/0_0_1000_962/1000.jpg\" alt=\"RSS Christmas Quiz 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"962\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">RSS Christmas Quiz 2018</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Charles Babbage is also a celebrated figure of the steampunk genre, which explains the distinctive styling of the image.</p> <p>The (statistical) significance of the question title \u201cTOM, DICK, AND\u2026\u201d is that Babbage was one of the founding members of the (Royal) Statistical Society, alongside Thomas Malthus and Richard Jones.</p> <p>Babbage\u2019s close associate Ada Lovelace famously wrote technical notes entitled \u201cNote A\u201d, \u201cNote B\u201d, \u2026, \u201cNote G\u201d, whose names mirror the seven notes of the musical scale. Following the system of notation shown in the diagram above, her first name \u2013 ADA \u2013 would be encoded as three similar 2x2 symbols in which the following circles are darkened: [bottom-left]; [top-left + bottom-left + bottom-right]; [bottom-left].</p> <h2>Q4. FLIP THE QUESTION (7 points)</h2> <p>(a) Each of the five acts has a song named after a playing card, but four of them are Queens, while the other is an Ace: \u201cQueen of Clubs\u201d (KC &amp; The Sunshine Band), \u201cQueen of Diamonds\u201d (Tom Odell), \u201cQueen of Spades\u201d (Styx), \u201cQueen of Hearts\u201d (Dave Edmunds), and \u201cAce of Spades\u201d (Mot\u00f6rhead). When \u201cplayed together\u201d (as a poker hand of four Queens plus an Ace kicker), the odd one out is the Ace \u2013 i.e. Mot\u00f6rhead. This theme is hinted at by the title, since flipping the question (\u201cQ4\u201d) gives \u201c4Q\u201d \u2013 i.e. four Queens.</p> <p>(b) By combining carefully chosen song titles from the 15 acts, in the order listed, we can recreate (almost all of) the opening lyrics to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d by Queen. (The opening to the song\u2019s music video famously features the faces of the four Queen band members \u2013 continuing the \u201c4Q\u201d theme.) The 15 song titles are (in sequence): \u201cIs This The Real Life\u201d / \u201cFantasy\u201d / \u201cLandslide\u201d / \u201cEscape from Reality\u201d / \u201cOpen Your Eyes\u201d / \u201cLook Up to the Sky\u201d / \u201cPoor Boy\u201d / \u201cNo Sympathy\u201d / \u201cBecause\u201d / \u201cEasy Come, Easy Go\u201d / \u201cA Little High\u201d / \u201cLow\u201d / \u201cAnyway\u201d / \u201cThe Winds Blows\u201d / \u201cDon\u2019t Matter to Me\u201d.</p> <h2>Q5. LOUD AND CLEAR (5 points)</h2> <p>The feat in question is an NBA \u201c5\u00d75\u201d (or \u201cfive-by-five\u201d), defined as a performance in which a basketball player accumulates at least five points, five rebounds, five assists, five steals, and five blocks in a single game. The initials given in the list denote the following basketball players: JE = Julius Erving, GJ = George T Johnson, GG = George Gervin, DR = David Robinson, DC = Derrick Coleman, VD = Vlade Divac, JT = Jamaal Tinsley, AK = Andrei Kirilenko, MC = Marcus Camby, NB = Nicolas Batum, DG = Draymond Green, and AD = Anthony Davis. (For further details, please see <a href=\"https://nbahoopsonline.com/History/Records/5x5.html\">nbahoopsonline</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-by-five_(basketball)\">Five-by-five</a>, which provide the tables from which the list of initials was created.)</p> <p>The person missing from the list is of course Hakeem Olajuwon \u2013 the most prolific achiever of 5\u00d75s in NBA history. When his initials are added back into the list (including repeats), the festive message \u201cHO, HO, HO\u201d is spelled out twice, as illustrated below:</p> <p>JE, GJ, GG, JE, HO, HO, HO, DR, DC, HO, HO, HO, VD, JT, AK, AK, MC, AK, NB, DG, AD</p> <p>(Two quick remarks: First, in keeping with the presentation on nbahoopsonline.com, Julius Erving\u2019s 5\u00d75 for the New York Nets in 1976 has been retained as the first element of the list, even though this technically falls under the jurisdiction of the American Basketball Association (ABA) rather than the NBA. Second, although the list finishes with the 5\u00d75 achieved by Anthony Davis on 21 November 2018, the Wikipedia page cited above notes that another 5\u00d75 was recently achieved by Jusuf Nurki\u0107 on 1 January 2019 \u2013 a few weeks after the quiz was released.)</p> <p>In addition to its basketball usage, the terminology \u201c5\u00d75\u201d also denotes a radio signal that has excellent strength and perfect clarity \u2013 this explains the question title, \u201cLOUD AND CLEAR\u201d. Moreover, as several solvers highlighted, it is particularly apt for the 25th anniversary quiz to feature a question on those who have achieved a \u201c5\u00d75\u201d \u2013 and it is also fitting that this is question number 5 in the quiz, and worth five points.</p> <h2>Q6. FREEZE-FRAMES (10 points)</h2> <p>Proceeding row by row, from left to right, the images depict the following works:</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cAs the Old Sing, So the Young Pipe\u201d by Jacob JORDAENS<br>\u2022 \u201cAt the Piano\u201d by Louise ABB\u00c9MA<br>\u2022 \u201cThe Tea\u201d, also known as \u201cFive O\u2019Clock Tea\u201d, by Mary CASSATT<br>\u2022 \u201cSleigh Ride\u201d by Rudolf KOLLER<br>\u2022 \u201c\u2018How Long Has He Been Lost?\u2019 Enquired the Giant\u201d (one of several illustrations for \u201cJohnny and the Giant\u201d in \u201cSt Nicholas Illustrated\u201d magazine) by James Montgomery FLAGG<br>\u2022 \u201cNantucket\u201d by Theodore ROBINSON<br>\u2022 \u201cDublin Streets: A Vendor of Books\u201d by Walter OSBORNE<br>\u2022 \u201cDancing Shoes\u201d by Helene SCHJERFBECK<br>\u2022 \u201cSnow in the Wood\u201d by Tom THOMSON</p> <p>The nine surnames, taken in order, spell out the wintry character \u201cJACK FROST\u201d (which echoes the question title, \u201cFREEZE-FRAMES\u201d).</p> <h2>Q7. LOTS ON THEIR PLATE (5 points)</h2> <p>(a) The answer is Dun Che Lao Ren \u2013 the name of Father Christmas in China. (Dun is a horse of a certain hue, Che [Guevara] is a famous revolutionary, Lao is the official language of Laos, and Ren is the chihuahua from The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show.) To explain the hint (\u201c80% of Q2\u201d): the theme of Question 2 was \u201cSilver\u201d and its association with the 25th anniversary, while \u201cChina\u201d is traditionally given for the 20th anniversary. (The word \u201cplate\u201d in the question title offers a further clue to this theme \u2013 and, as several entrants noted, the \u201cFather Christmas\u201d in the world\u2019s most populated country would certainly have \u201clots on their plate\u201d.)</p> <p>(b) Echoing the name of the much-loathed Christmas vegetable (and as hinted at by the question title), Chantal and Isala are playing a game of \u201cSprouts\u201d over in Brussels. Sprouts is a paper-and-pencil game invented in the 1960s by Cambridge mathematicians John H. Conway and Michael S. Paterson \u2013 and in fact, Chantal and Isala\u2019s moves recreate exactly the example given on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprouts_(game).%20Isala%20smiles%20after%20playing%20her%20second%20move\">game\u2019s Wikipedia page</a>. Isala smiles after playing her second move because she has won the game. The players\u2019 names are references to Chantal Akerman and Isala Van Diest \u2013 two famous Belgian women who will soon have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/aug/22/ceci-nest-pas-une-rue-where-the-streets-have-new-names-brussels\">streets in Brussels named after them</a>, as announced in summer 2018.</p> <h2>Q8. THREE POINT FIVE POINT\u2026 (3 points)</h2> <p>Versions 3.5.0, 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 (echoing the question title) of the R statistical programming language were released during 2018 \u2013 and in keeping with tradition, each had a short codename referencing a historical Peanuts comic strip. Version 3.5.0 was named \u201cJoy in Playing\u201d (referencing the 27 January 1973 strip), Version 3.5.1 was named \u201cFeather Spray\u201d (referencing the 9 March 1972 strip), and Version 3.5.2 was named \u201cEggshell Igloo\u201d (referencing the 25-26 January 1960 strips). These phrases are visible at the top of the R Console whenever it is opened.</p> <p>For further details on the connections between R\u2019s version names and the Peanuts comic strips, please see <a href=\"https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/09/28/r-release-names/\">this excellent blogpost</a>.</p> <h2>Q9. SPSS: A SPECIAL ANNIVERSARY (5 points)</h2> <p>Although 2018 was the 50th anniversary year of the SPSS statistical software package, this is a deliberate \u201cred herring\u201d. In fact, this question concerns an entirely different kind of SPSS: namely, a \u201cSimple Perfect Squared Square\u201d \u2013 and specifically, the order-21 SPSS discovered in 1978 by A. J. W. Duijvestijn, which is shown in the diagram below. (For further background on \u201csquaring the square\u201d please <a href=\"http://www.squaring.net/sq/ss/spss/spss.html\">see here</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_square\">here</a>.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a2afb7ab99c78e8ee828a47b9fcb9d6c30d3a63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a2afb7ab99c78e8ee828a47b9fcb9d6c30d3a63/0_0_744_743/500.png\" alt=\"RSS Christmas Quiz 2018\" width=\"500\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">RSS Christmas Quiz 2018</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As shown in the diagram, the nine numbers on the exterior of Duijvestijn\u2019s SPSS (representing the side lengths of the constituent squares) are 50, 35, 27, 19, 24, 42, 37, 33, and 29 \u2013 exactly the numbers given in the question. The 12 numbers appearing in the interior are therefore 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 25 (listed in order of size).</p> <p>The largest interior number (25) and three of its neighbours (4, 9, and 16) are all square numbers themselves \u2013 a very appropriate property for a question about squared squares.</p> <p>Moreover, as some solvers noted, it is also apt that this is a square-numbered question (namely, question 9) in a quiz that is itself celebrating a square-numbered anniversary (namely, the 25th).</p> <p>Finally, to receive full credit, solvers should have explained the question title by noting that 2018 was a special anniversary year (namely, the 40th anniversary) for Duijvestijn\u2019s SPSS too.</p> <h2>Q10. BICHHOO (YO!) (8 points)</h2> <p>Most entrants correctly deduced that the ten different letters within the word equations needed to be assigned a different digit such that all five results on the right-hand side corresponded to English words. (These ten letters can be rearranged to give the word HYPERBOLIC, a piece of mathematical terminology that is also the name of a probability distribution \u2013 a fitting choice for an RSS Quiz.)</p> <p>Although the number of possible ways to associate the ten letters with the ten digits is very large (3628800 = 10!, where the exclamation mark denotes \u201cfactorial\u201d), the problem can be simplified greatly by realising that the title \u201cBICHHOO (YO!)\u201d is simply an encoded version of this number of possibilities, i.e. \u201c3628800 (10!)\u201d. Therefore, B=3, I=6, C=2, H=8, O=0, and Y=1. It can then quickly be ascertained from the equations themselves that the code should be completed by setting E=4, L=5, P=7, and R=9 \u2013 and the five words on the right-hand side are therefore COPIER, BICYCLE, PYRRHIC, HORROR and EERIER.</p> <p>The shade of grey appearing in the image\u2019s border has a hexadecimal colour code of #808080, which corresponds to the festive message \u201cHO HO HO\u201d under the encoding used in the question. (Of course, this echoes Q5, where the same message made an appearance.)</p> <p>\u201cBichhoo\u201d is the Hindi word for \u201cScorpion\u201d, so the question title \u201cBICHHOO (YO!)\u201d would strike a chord with the rapper Drake from Q4, who released a double album called Scorpion in 2018 (which, appropriately, comprised 25 tracks \u2013 one of them being \u201cDon\u2019t Matter to Me\u201d). He might even be tempted to add the \u201cYO!\u201d at the end for emphasis. Drake\u2019s full name is Aubrey Drake Graham, so he\u2019d feel particularly at home in Q2, which features famous people with the initials AG.</p> <h2>Q11. P.I.G. (5 points)</h2> <p>The property described in the question is satisfied by the prime numbers in German (and the initials in the question title \u2013 \u201cP.I.G.\u201d \u2013 stand for \u201cPrimes In German\u201d).</p> <p>The first 25 primes in German are \u201czwei\u201d (2), \u201cdrei\u201d (3), \u201cf\u00fcnf\u201d (5), \u201csieben\u201d (7), \u201celf\u201d (11), and so on, through to \u201csiebenundneunzig\u201d (97) \u2013 and the initial letters of these 25 names follow the letter distribution stated in the question. (Since the German names for the numbers between 20 and 99 always state the units first, followed by the tens, the primes in this range all have names starting with \u201cein\u201d, \u201cdrei\u201d, \u201csieben\u201d, or \u201cneun\u201d, which explains the high frequencies for the letters \u2018e\u2019, \u2018d\u2019, \u2018s\u2019 and \u2018n\u2019.)</p> <p>The next 25 elements in the sequence \u2013 i.e. the 26th prime through to the 50th prime \u2013 range from \u201ceinhunderteins\u201d (101) to \u201czweihundertneunundzwanzig\u201d (229). In each case, the number of hundreds is written first, and so it is easy to check that these elements comprise 21 \u2018e\u2019s and 4 \u2018z\u2019s. (The prefix \u201ceinhundert-\u201d can also be shortened to \u201chundert-\u201d, so stating the answer as 21 \u2018h\u2019s and 4 \u2018z\u2019s would also be perfectly correct.)</p> <p>Finally, the fifth element of the sequence (and the shortest, with only three letters) is \u201celf\u201d. Of course, the reason this element \u201cmight provide a little help\u201d is that the elves are known as \u201cSanta\u2019s little helpers\u201d.</p> <h2>Q12. IT\u2019S A LAP (6 points)</h2> <p>The ratio of the longest strand length (orange) to the shortest strand length (purple) is equal to the square root of 21 (or sqrt(21), for brevity). If we take the purple strand to be 1 unit in length, the other coloured strands have the following lengths: green = 2, yellow = sqrt(3), pink = sqrt(7), red = sqrt(13), blue = sqrt(19), and orange = sqrt(21).</p> <p>Several entrants reached the correct answer by identifying the parallelograms in the figure, and repeatedly applying the well-known formula linking the lengths of a parallelogram\u2019s sides to the lengths of its diagonals. However, it turns out that all eight nodes (i.e. tinsel attachment points) in the original diagram lie on a regular triangular grid whose side length equals the length of the purple strand (or equivalently, half of the green strand), as shown in the augmented diagram below. From this augmented diagram, it is easy to calculate the length of each strand colour by applying Pythagoras\u2019 Theorem \u2013 and the answer of sqrt(21) then follows immediately.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46cfde0a0f0e5d4c546b517a623dd76210f4f79a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46cfde0a0f0e5d4c546b517a623dd76210f4f79a/0_0_3000_3000/1000.png\" alt=\"RSS Christmas Quiz 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">RSS Christmas Quiz 2018</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Structures like this \u2013 with the special property that each inter-node length occurs a different number of times \u2013 are called \u201ccrescent configurations\u201d, hence the question\u2019s reference to a \u201cmoonlit\u201d night. The particular eight-node crescent configuration illustrated in this question was discovered by Palasti, whose name is revealed by reversing the question title. (Coincidentally, the name \u201cPalasti\u201d is also an anagram of the word \u201cspatial\u201d.)</p> <p>Please <a href=\"https://www.emis.de/journals/INTEGERS/papers/q38/q38.pdf%20for%20further\">see here</a> for further background on crescent configurations (and note that Figure 1 on Page 3 is a rotated version of the original diagram given in the question).</p> <h2>Q13. FUSION (8 points)</h2> <p>(a) When completed, the diagram represents the five different versions of the film \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d (as hinted at by the title \u2013 \u201cFUSION\u201d \u2013 which is the process underlying the birth of stars). The numbers on the arrows indicate the time gap in years between the respective versions, and the pairs of initials indicate the female and male leads. Thus, the first pair JG + FM represents Janet Gaynor and Fredric March (from the original 1937 version); the second pair is JG + JM, representing Judy Garland and James Mason (from the 1954 version, 17 years later); the third pair is BS + KK, representing Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson (from the 1976 version); the fourth pair is SK + ARK, representing Shraddha Kapoor and Aditya Roy Kapur (from the 2013 Bollywood version); and the fifth and final pair, LG + BC, represents Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper (from the 2018 version). Lady Gaga is linked to theme of Q4 in two different ways: she wrote the iconic dance-pop song \u201cPoker Face\u201d (echoing the poker hand theme in Q4a), and the name \u201cLady Gaga\u201d was originally derived from the song \u201cRadio Ga Ga\u201d by the rock group Queen (echoing Q4b).</p> <p>(b) Continuing the themes of \u201ca star is born\u201d and \u201cfusion\u201d, part (b) concerns the different configurations of stars appearing on the flag of the United States of America during the evolution of \u201cthe union\u201d \u2013 and specifically, the five configurations that have been adopted for the greatest length of time. The left-hand side of each \u201cequation\u201d indicates a particular configuration of stars (e.g. 4 \u00d7 6 means 4 rows of 6), while the right-hand side indicates the number of years for which that configuration was in use, according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States).%20The%20missing%20entry%20in%20the%20final\">Wikipedia</a>. The missing entry in the final row should therefore be filled in with 5 \u00d7 6 + 4 \u00d7 5 (i.e. the current configuration of 50 stars), which has been in use for 58 years. Finally, it is apt that this is question number 13, as this has been the number of stripes on the American flag throughout the course of its evolution (with the exception of the 23 year period between 1 May 1795 and 3 July 1818).</p> <h2>Q14. HEX 19 (6 points)</h2> <p>Using computer simulations, spreadsheet calculations, or just a healthy dose of intuition, many entrants correctly assessed that Nathaniel\u2019s stroll was most likely to finish in the second hex down in the column one to the right of his starting hex. (This hex is only two steps away from Nathaniel\u2019s starting hex, and has a full complement of six neighbours.)</p> <p>The question title \u201cHEX 19\u201d is a coded reference to DEC 25 (i.e. Christmas), since the hexadecimal number \u201c19\u201d is equal to the decimal number \u201c25\u201d \u2013 and, as several entrants noted, the island depicted in the question is Christmas Island.</p> <p>A handful of entrants also noted that the \u201cSilver\u201d theme from Q2 also resurfaces with a vengeance: \u201cNathaniel\u201d is the famous statistician Nate Silver; his stroll begins at Silver City (located in the indicated region of Christmas Island); and \u201cafter a barbecue\u201d is a nod to Long John Silver from Treasure Island, whose nickname was \u201cBarbecue\u201d. Many congratulations if you managed to spot all of these cryptic connections.</p> <h2>Q15. THE BROMPTONS (5 points)</h2> <p>Philip\u2019s advent calendar has the special property that each row represents a square number, if we concatenate the five numbered doors from left to right \u2013 for instance, the top row contains the number 1218816 which equals 1104 squared, the next row contains 231192025 which equals 15205 squared, and so on. A helpful clue is provided by the question title, since \u201cThe Bromptons\u201d is a London address on Rose Square (a pun on \u201crows square\u201d) \u2013 moreover, it is the former site of Brompton Hospital, whose establishment in the 1840s was spearheaded by Sir Philip Rose, mirroring the \u201cPhilip\u201d in the question. (<a href=\"http://www.thebromptons.org.uk/?c=4154\">See here</a> for further details.)</p> <p>Finally, as several entrants noted, the calendar also contains a bonus festive message: under the standard letters-to-numbers mapping (whereby A=1, B=2, C=3, and so on), the five doors in the central column of the calendar spell out \u201cRINGS\u201d in gold \u2013 i.e. \u201cfive gold rings\u201d.</p> <p><em>The 25th Anniversary Edition of the Royal Statistical Society Christmas Quiz was set by Dr Tim Paulden.

      "bodyText": "In mid-December, we published the 25th anniversary edition of the Royal Statistical Society\u2019s Christmas Quiz \u2013 a diabolically tough collection of puzzles devised by Dr Tim Paulden. How many did you manage to crack? (If you would like to take another look at the quiz before seeing the answers, the questions are still available here.) The winning entry was submitted by the team comprising Charles Steinhardt, Paul Melamud, Corey Plover &amp; Eric MV \u2013 and a one-year subscription to the society\u2019s Significance Magazine will shortly be winging its way to them. In addition, to mark the 25th anniversary of the RSS Christmas Quiz, the quizmaster will be making a charitable donation of \u00a3250, to be split equally between the ten good causes nominated by this year\u2019s top 10 entrants (listed below, in alphabetical order). If you have enjoyed the puzzles in this year\u2019s quiz, please consider making a small donation to one of these good causes \u2013 or another charity close to your heart. \u2022 Alzheimer\u2019s Society (nominated by Michael Pickard) \u2022 Cued Speech UK (nominated by Andrew Garratt) \u2022 GiveWell (nominated by Andy &amp; Sam Knott) \u2022 Great Ormond Street Hospital Children\u2019s Charity (nominated by Charles Steinhardt, Paul Melamud, Corey Plover &amp; Eric MV) \u2022 Mind UK (nominated by Leigh Sinton, David Nandi, Steven Barrett, Jake Barrett &amp; Jonny White) \u2022 MND Association (nominated by David Harris) \u2022 RSPCA (nominated by Mark Payton, Gordon Emslie, Merrall Price &amp; Ron Wasserstein) \u2022 Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (nominated by Liam Hughes) \u2022 Sightsavers (nominated by Paul Southern) \u2022 The Forest Foodbank, run by Coleford Baptist Church (nominated by Ian Davies) And now, the solutions \u2026 Q1. GREETINGS (9 points) The five strings of initial letters, after correction, come from: \u2022 \u201cA Visit from St. Nicholas\u201d aka \u201cThe Night Before Christmas\u201d (\u201c\u2018Twas the night before Christmas / When all through the house / Not a creature was stirring / Not even a mouse\u201d) \u2022 \u201cWe\u2019re Walking in the Air\u201d (\u201cWe\u2019re walking in the air / We\u2019re floating in the moonlit sky / The people far below are sleeping as we fly / I\u2019m holding very tight / I\u2019m riding in the midnight blue / I\u2019m finding I can fly so high above with you\u201d) \u2022 \u201cSilent Night\u201d (\u201cSilent night, holy night / All is calm, all is bright / Round yon virgin, mother and child / Holy infant so tender and mild / Sleep in heavenly peace / Sleep in heavenly peace\u201d) \u2022 \u201cFairytale of New York\u201d (specifically, verse 3: \u201cThey\u2019ve got cars big as bars, they\u2019ve got rivers of gold / But the wind goes right through you, it\u2019s no place for the old / When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve / You promised me Broadway was waiting for me\u201d) \u2022 \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d (specifically, Scrooge\u2019s famous pronouncement: \u201cI am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy. I am as giddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to everybody! A happy New Year to all the world! Hallo here! Whoop! Hallo!\u201d) The 15 errors, in order, are HIMIWWIAATYYLTM, which are the initial letters of the opening to the song \u201cHello\u201d by Adele (\u201cHello / It\u2019s me / I was wondering if after all these years you\u2019d like to meet\u201d). This song is a particularly apt choice for the first question of the 25th anniversary quiz, as it is the first track from the album \u201c25\u201d. (The song title \u201cHello\u201d is also reflected in the question title, \u201cGreetings\u201d.) Q2. BILKO (11 points) All eight individuals have the initials AG: (a) Art Garfunkel (who performed with Paul Simon as \u201cTom &amp; Jerry\u201d) (b) Sir Alec Guinness (who achieved the rank of Lieutenant in World War II, played Colonel Nicholson in \u201cThe Bridge on the River Kwai\u201d, and played Obi-Wan \u201cBen\u201d Kenobi in the original Star Wars trilogy) (c) Antony Gormley (who created the sculpture \u201cAngel of the North\u201d, which features in \u201cTravelling in a Strange Land\u201d by David Park) (d) Anna Gunn (who famously played Skyler White in Breaking Bad) (e) Antoine Griezmann (who won the 2018 Fifa World Cup with France while wearing the number seven shirt, and was also awarded the Silver Boot and Bronze Ball) (f) Al Gore (who was the 45th vice-president of the USA, four after Nelson Rockefeller) (g) Amy Grant (born in Augusta, whose golf course hosts the Masters \u2013 one of golf\u2019s \u201cmajors\u201d \u2013 and has an 18th hole called \u201cHolly\u201d) (h) Ali G (the satirical character created by Sacha Baron Cohen). Art Garfunkel and Amy Grant have previously collaborated \u2013 the context being, appropriately, a Christmas album called \u201cThe Animals\u2019 Christmas\u201d. They are labelled (a) and (g) in the above list \u2013 another juxtaposition of those two letters. As many solvers noted, AG is a particularly appropriate choice for the common set of initials because Ag is the chemical symbol for Silver \u2013 traditionally associated with a 25th anniversary. Collectively, the eight answers in this question might therefore be described as \u201cSilvers\u201d \u2013 this explains the question title \u201cBILKO\u201d, since Phil Silvers famously played (Sergeant) Bilko on \u201cThe Phil Silvers Show\u201d (see The Phil Silvers Show). Q3. TOM, DICK, AND\u2026 (7 points) The person is \u201cCBABBAGE\u201d \u2013 i.e. Charles Babbage, the world-famous computer pioneer. All of the letters in the message are notes of the musical scale, and the symbols given in the question show how to play these notes on a four-hole ocarina (as hinted at by the word \u201cblow\u201d in the first sentence). The following diagram (which is available online at this website) illustrates this system of notation \u2013 and it can be readily seen that the message in the question image corresponds to \u201cCBABBAGE\u201d. Charles Babbage is also a celebrated figure of the steampunk genre, which explains the distinctive styling of the image. The (statistical) significance of the question title \u201cTOM, DICK, AND\u2026\u201d is that Babbage was one of the founding members of the (Royal) Statistical Society, alongside Thomas Malthus and Richard Jones. Babbage\u2019s close associate Ada Lovelace famously wrote technical notes entitled \u201cNote A\u201d, \u201cNote B\u201d, \u2026, \u201cNote G\u201d, whose names mirror the seven notes of the musical scale. Following the system of notation shown in the diagram above, her first name \u2013 ADA \u2013 would be encoded as three similar 2x2 symbols in which the following circles are darkened: [bottom-left]; [top-left + bottom-left + bottom-right]; [bottom-left]. Q4. FLIP THE QUESTION (7 points) (a) Each of the five acts has a song named after a playing card, but four of them are Queens, while the other is an Ace: \u201cQueen of Clubs\u201d (KC &amp; The Sunshine Band), \u201cQueen of Diamonds\u201d (Tom Odell), \u201cQueen of Spades\u201d (Styx), \u201cQueen of Hearts\u201d (Dave Edmunds), and \u201cAce of Spades\u201d (Mot\u00f6rhead). When \u201cplayed together\u201d (as a poker hand of four Queens plus an Ace kicker), the odd one out is the Ace \u2013 i.e. Mot\u00f6rhead. This theme is hinted at by the title, since flipping the question (\u201cQ4\u201d) gives \u201c4Q\u201d \u2013 i.e. four Queens. (b) By combining carefully chosen song titles from the 15 acts, in the order listed, we can recreate (almost all of) the opening lyrics to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d by Queen. (The opening to the song\u2019s music video famously features the faces of the four Queen band members \u2013 continuing the \u201c4Q\u201d theme.) The 15 song titles are (in sequence): \u201cIs This The Real Life\u201d / \u201cFantasy\u201d / \u201cLandslide\u201d / \u201cEscape from Reality\u201d / \u201cOpen Your Eyes\u201d / \u201cLook Up to the Sky\u201d / \u201cPoor Boy\u201d / \u201cNo Sympathy\u201d / \u201cBecause\u201d / \u201cEasy Come, Easy Go\u201d / \u201cA Little High\u201d / \u201cLow\u201d / \u201cAnyway\u201d / \u201cThe Winds Blows\u201d / \u201cDon\u2019t Matter to Me\u201d. Q5. LOUD AND CLEAR (5 points) The feat in question is an NBA \u201c5\u00d75\u201d (or \u201cfive-by-five\u201d), defined as a performance in which a basketball player accumulates at least five points, five rebounds, five assists, five steals, and five blocks in a single game. The initials given in the list denote the following basketball players: JE = Julius Erving, GJ = George T Johnson, GG = George Gervin, DR = David Robinson, DC = Derrick Coleman, VD = Vlade Divac, JT = Jamaal Tinsley, AK = Andrei Kirilenko, MC = Marcus Camby, NB = Nicolas Batum, DG = Draymond Green, and AD = Anthony Davis. (For further details, please see nbahoopsonline and Five-by-five, which provide the tables from which the list of initials was created.) The person missing from the list is of course Hakeem Olajuwon \u2013 the most prolific achiever of 5\u00d75s in NBA history. When his initials are added back into the list (including repeats), the festive message \u201cHO, HO, HO\u201d is spelled out twice, as illustrated below: JE, GJ, GG, JE, HO, HO, HO, DR, DC, HO, HO, HO, VD, JT, AK, AK, MC, AK, NB, DG, AD (Two quick remarks: First, in keeping with the presentation on nbahoopsonline.com, Julius Erving\u2019s 5\u00d75 for the New York Nets in 1976 has been retained as the first element of the list, even though this technically falls under the jurisdiction of the American Basketball Association (ABA) rather than the NBA. Second, although the list finishes with the 5\u00d75 achieved by Anthony Davis on 21 November 2018, the Wikipedia page cited above notes that another 5\u00d75 was recently achieved by Jusuf Nurki\u0107 on 1 January 2019 \u2013 a few weeks after the quiz was released.) In addition to its basketball usage, the terminology \u201c5\u00d75\u201d also denotes a radio signal that has excellent strength and perfect clarity \u2013 this explains the question title, \u201cLOUD AND CLEAR\u201d. Moreover, as several solvers highlighted, it is particularly apt for the 25th anniversary quiz to feature a question on those who have achieved a \u201c5\u00d75\u201d \u2013 and it is also fitting that this is question number 5 in the quiz, and worth five points. Q6. FREEZE-FRAMES (10 points) Proceeding row by row, from left to right, the images depict the following works: \u2022 \u201cAs the Old Sing, So the Young Pipe\u201d by Jacob JORDAENS \u2022 \u201cAt the Piano\u201d by Louise ABB\u00c9MA \u2022 \u201cThe Tea\u201d, also known as \u201cFive O\u2019Clock Tea\u201d, by Mary CASSATT \u2022 \u201cSleigh Ride\u201d by Rudolf KOLLER \u2022 \u201c\u2018How Long Has He Been Lost?\u2019 Enquired the Giant\u201d (one of several illustrations for \u201cJohnny and the Giant\u201d in \u201cSt Nicholas Illustrated\u201d magazine) by James Montgomery FLAGG \u2022 \u201cNantucket\u201d by Theodore ROBINSON \u2022 \u201cDublin Streets: A Vendor of Books\u201d by Walter OSBORNE \u2022 \u201cDancing Shoes\u201d by Helene SCHJERFBECK \u2022 \u201cSnow in the Wood\u201d by Tom THOMSON The nine surnames, taken in order, spell out the wintry character \u201cJACK FROST\u201d (which echoes the question title, \u201cFREEZE-FRAMES\u201d). Q7. LOTS ON THEIR PLATE (5 points) (a) The answer is Dun Che Lao Ren \u2013 the name of Father Christmas in China. (Dun is a horse of a certain hue, Che [Guevara] is a famous revolutionary, Lao is the official language of Laos, and Ren is the chihuahua from The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show.) To explain the hint (\u201c80% of Q2\u201d): the theme of Question 2 was \u201cSilver\u201d and its association with the 25th anniversary, while \u201cChina\u201d is traditionally given for the 20th anniversary. (The word \u201cplate\u201d in the question title offers a further clue to this theme \u2013 and, as several entrants noted, the \u201cFather Christmas\u201d in the world\u2019s most populated country would certainly have \u201clots on their plate\u201d.) (b) Echoing the name of the much-loathed Christmas vegetable (and as hinted at by the question title), Chantal and Isala are playing a game of \u201cSprouts\u201d over in Brussels. Sprouts is a paper-and-pencil game invented in the 1960s by Cambridge mathematicians John H. Conway and Michael S. Paterson \u2013 and in fact, Chantal and Isala\u2019s moves recreate exactly the example given on the game\u2019s Wikipedia page. Isala smiles after playing her second move because she has won the game. The players\u2019 names are references to Chantal Akerman and Isala Van Diest \u2013 two famous Belgian women who will soon have streets in Brussels named after them, as announced in summer 2018. Q8. THREE POINT FIVE POINT\u2026 (3 points) Versions 3.5.0, 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 (echoing the question title) of the R statistical programming language were released during 2018 \u2013 and in keeping with tradition, each had a short codename referencing a historical Peanuts comic strip. Version 3.5.0 was named \u201cJoy in Playing\u201d (referencing the 27 January 1973 strip), Version 3.5.1 was named \u201cFeather Spray\u201d (referencing the 9 March 1972 strip), and Version 3.5.2 was named \u201cEggshell Igloo\u201d (referencing the 25-26 January 1960 strips). These phrases are visible at the top of the R Console whenever it is opened. For further details on the connections between R\u2019s version names and the Peanuts comic strips, please see this excellent blogpost. Q9. SPSS: A SPECIAL ANNIVERSARY (5 points) Although 2018 was the 50th anniversary year of the SPSS statistical software package, this is a deliberate \u201cred herring\u201d. In fact, this question concerns an entirely different kind of SPSS: namely, a \u201cSimple Perfect Squared Square\u201d \u2013 and specifically, the order-21 SPSS discovered in 1978 by A. J. W. Duijvestijn, which is shown in the diagram below. (For further background on \u201csquaring the square\u201d please see here and here.) As shown in the diagram, the nine numbers on the exterior of Duijvestijn\u2019s SPSS (representing the side lengths of the constituent squares) are 50, 35, 27, 19, 24, 42, 37, 33, and 29 \u2013 exactly the numbers given in the question. The 12 numbers appearing in the interior are therefore 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 25 (listed in order of size). The largest interior number (25) and three of its neighbours (4, 9, and 16) are all square numbers themselves \u2013 a very appropriate property for a question about squared squares. Moreover, as some solvers noted, it is also apt that this is a square-numbered question (namely, question 9) in a quiz that is itself celebrating a square-numbered anniversary (namely, the 25th). Finally, to receive full credit, solvers should have explained the question title by noting that 2018 was a special anniversary year (namely, the 40th anniversary) for Duijvestijn\u2019s SPSS too. Q10. BICHHOO (YO!) (8 points) Most entrants correctly deduced that the ten different letters within the word equations needed to be assigned a different digit such that all five results on the right-hand side corresponded to English words. (These ten letters can be rearranged to give the word HYPERBOLIC, a piece of mathematical terminology that is also the name of a probability distribution \u2013 a fitting choice for an RSS Quiz.) Although the number of possible ways to associate the ten letters with the ten digits is very large (3628800 = 10!, where the exclamation mark denotes \u201cfactorial\u201d), the problem can be simplified greatly by realising that the title \u201cBICHHOO (YO!)\u201d is simply an encoded version of this number of possibilities, i.e. \u201c3628800 (10!)\u201d. Therefore, B=3, I=6, C=2, H=8, O=0, and Y=1. It can then quickly be ascertained from the equations themselves that the code should be completed by setting E=4, L=5, P=7, and R=9 \u2013 and the five words on the right-hand side are therefore COPIER, BICYCLE, PYRRHIC, HORROR and EERIER. The shade of grey appearing in the image\u2019s border has a hexadecimal colour code of #808080, which corresponds to the festive message \u201cHO HO HO\u201d under the encoding used in the question. (Of course, this echoes Q5, where the same message made an appearance.) \u201cBichhoo\u201d is the Hindi word for \u201cScorpion\u201d, so the question title \u201cBICHHOO (YO!)\u201d would strike a chord with the rapper Drake from Q4, who released a double album called Scorpion in 2018 (which, appropriately, comprised 25 tracks \u2013 one of them being \u201cDon\u2019t Matter to Me\u201d). He might even be tempted to add the \u201cYO!\u201d at the end for emphasis. Drake\u2019s full name is Aubrey Drake Graham, so he\u2019d feel particularly at home in Q2, which features famous people with the initials AG. Q11. P.I.G. (5 points) The property described in the question is satisfied by the prime numbers in German (and the initials in the question title \u2013 \u201cP.I.G.\u201d \u2013 stand for \u201cPrimes In German\u201d). The first 25 primes in German are \u201czwei\u201d (2), \u201cdrei\u201d (3), \u201cf\u00fcnf\u201d (5), \u201csieben\u201d (7), \u201celf\u201d (11), and so on, through to \u201csiebenundneunzig\u201d (97) \u2013 and the initial letters of these 25 names follow the letter distribution stated in the question. (Since the German names for the numbers between 20 and 99 always state the units first, followed by the tens, the primes in this range all have names starting with \u201cein\u201d, \u201cdrei\u201d, \u201csieben\u201d, or \u201cneun\u201d, which explains the high frequencies for the letters \u2018e\u2019, \u2018d\u2019, \u2018s\u2019 and \u2018n\u2019.) The next 25 elements in the sequence \u2013 i.e. the 26th prime through to the 50th prime \u2013 range from \u201ceinhunderteins\u201d (101) to \u201czweihundertneunundzwanzig\u201d (229). In each case, the number of hundreds is written first, and so it is easy to check that these elements comprise 21 \u2018e\u2019s and 4 \u2018z\u2019s. (The prefix \u201ceinhundert-\u201d can also be shortened to \u201chundert-\u201d, so stating the answer as 21 \u2018h\u2019s and 4 \u2018z\u2019s would also be perfectly correct.) Finally, the fifth element of the sequence (and the shortest, with only three letters) is \u201celf\u201d. Of course, the reason this element \u201cmight provide a little help\u201d is that the elves are known as \u201cSanta\u2019s little helpers\u201d. Q12. IT\u2019S A LAP (6 points) The ratio of the longest strand length (orange) to the shortest strand length (purple) is equal to the square root of 21 (or sqrt(21), for brevity). If we take the purple strand to be 1 unit in length, the other coloured strands have the following lengths: green = 2, yellow = sqrt(3), pink = sqrt(7), red = sqrt(13), blue = sqrt(19), and orange = sqrt(21). Several entrants reached the correct answer by identifying the parallelograms in the figure, and repeatedly applying the well-known formula linking the lengths of a parallelogram\u2019s sides to the lengths of its diagonals. However, it turns out that all eight nodes (i.e. tinsel attachment points) in the original diagram lie on a regular triangular grid whose side length equals the length of the purple strand (or equivalently, half of the green strand), as shown in the augmented diagram below. From this augmented diagram, it is easy to calculate the length of each strand colour by applying Pythagoras\u2019 Theorem \u2013 and the answer of sqrt(21) then follows immediately. Structures like this \u2013 with the special property that each inter-node length occurs a different number of times \u2013 are called \u201ccrescent configurations\u201d, hence the question\u2019s reference to a \u201cmoonlit\u201d night. The particular eight-node crescent configuration illustrated in this question was discovered by Palasti, whose name is revealed by reversing the question title. (Coincidentally, the name \u201cPalasti\u201d is also an anagram of the word \u201cspatial\u201d.) Please see here for further background on crescent configurations (and note that Figure 1 on Page 3 is a rotated version of the original diagram given in the question). Q13. FUSION (8 points) (a) When completed, the diagram represents the five different versions of the film \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d (as hinted at by the title \u2013 \u201cFUSION\u201d \u2013 which is the process underlying the birth of stars). The numbers on the arrows indicate the time gap in years between the respective versions, and the pairs of initials indicate the female and male leads. Thus, the first pair JG + FM represents Janet Gaynor and Fredric March (from the original 1937 version); the second pair is JG + JM, representing Judy Garland and James Mason (from the 1954 version, 17 years later); the third pair is BS + KK, representing Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson (from the 1976 version); the fourth pair is SK + ARK, representing Shraddha Kapoor and Aditya Roy Kapur (from the 2013 Bollywood version); and the fifth and final pair, LG + BC, represents Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper (from the 2018 version). Lady Gaga is linked to theme of Q4 in two different ways: she wrote the iconic dance-pop song \u201cPoker Face\u201d (echoing the poker hand theme in Q4a), and the name \u201cLady Gaga\u201d was originally derived from the song \u201cRadio Ga Ga\u201d by the rock group Queen (echoing Q4b). (b) Continuing the themes of \u201ca star is born\u201d and \u201cfusion\u201d, part (b) concerns the different configurations of stars appearing on the flag of the United States of America during the evolution of \u201cthe union\u201d \u2013 and specifically, the five configurations that have been adopted for the greatest length of time. The left-hand side of each \u201cequation\u201d indicates a particular configuration of stars (e.g. 4 \u00d7 6 means 4 rows of 6), while the right-hand side indicates the number of years for which that configuration was in use, according to Wikipedia. The missing entry in the final row should therefore be filled in with 5 \u00d7 6 + 4 \u00d7 5 (i.e. the current configuration of 50 stars), which has been in use for 58 years. Finally, it is apt that this is question number 13, as this has been the number of stripes on the American flag throughout the course of its evolution (with the exception of the 23 year period between 1 May 1795 and 3 July 1818). Q14. HEX 19 (6 points) Using computer simulations, spreadsheet calculations, or just a healthy dose of intuition, many entrants correctly assessed that Nathaniel\u2019s stroll was most likely to finish in the second hex down in the column one to the right of his starting hex. (This hex is only two steps away from Nathaniel\u2019s starting hex, and has a full complement of six neighbours.) The question title \u201cHEX 19\u201d is a coded reference to DEC 25 (i.e. Christmas), since the hexadecimal number \u201c19\u201d is equal to the decimal number \u201c25\u201d \u2013 and, as several entrants noted, the island depicted in the question is Christmas Island. A handful of entrants also noted that the \u201cSilver\u201d theme from Q2 also resurfaces with a vengeance: \u201cNathaniel\u201d is the famous statistician Nate Silver; his stroll begins at Silver City (located in the indicated region of Christmas Island); and \u201cafter a barbecue\u201d is a nod to Long John Silver from Treasure Island, whose nickname was \u201cBarbecue\u201d. Many congratulations if you managed to spot all of these cryptic connections. Q15. THE BROMPTONS (5 points) Philip\u2019s advent calendar has the special property that each row represents a square number, if we concatenate the five numbered doors from left to right \u2013 for instance, the top row contains the number 1218816 which equals 1104 squared, the next row contains 231192025 which equals 15205 squared, and so on. A helpful clue is provided by the question title, since \u201cThe Bromptons\u201d is a London address on Rose Square (a pun on \u201crows square\u201d) \u2013 moreover, it is the former site of Brompton Hospital, whose establishment in the 1840s was spearheaded by Sir Philip Rose, mirroring the \u201cPhilip\u201d in the question. (See here for further details.) Finally, as several entrants noted, the calendar also contains a bonus festive message: under the standard letters-to-numbers mapping (whereby A=1, B=2, C=3, and so on), the five doors in the central column of the calendar spell out \u201cRINGS\u201d in gold \u2013 i.e. \u201cfive gold rings\u201d. The 25th Anniversary Edition of the Royal Statistical Society Christmas Quiz was set by Dr Tim Paulden. Many thanks to Jon Nelson and Tom Thorpe for their helpful contributions.",

She found the report had actually recommended the tree be retained, that decay was healing well and that pavement damage was \u201cminor\u201d. Her complaint has been upheld. A soon-to-be officially published ruling by the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman has made a finding of fault against the council. The ombudsman ruled that the contractor, Amey, had \u201cdeliberately set out not to reveal the true advice it had received\u201d. Goldsmith said the case raises concerns about the council\u2019s approach to the wider felling programme. Campaigners believe many trees have been removed unnecessarily.

This reflects on the council, not only with regard to this tree but for many threatened trees throughout the city.\u201d The report said the council had accepted the findings while noting the authority had said it was under \u201cexceptional pressure\u201d due to public protests over its wider tree-felling policy, which involved the removal of thousands of street trees and their replacements with saplings. The tree in question had been recommended for removal in 2015 as part of its Streets Ahead highways project. However, the council rejected advice from its own surveyor that could save the tree, maintaining it was damaging the pavement. Two attempts were made to fell the tree but were frustrated by protesters. The ombudsman said one of the council\u2019s faults in the case was failing to give the independent panel all of its reasons for wanting to fell the tree, meaning it did not consider the issue of possible highway damage. The report, which refers to Sally Goldsmith as \u201cMs C\u201d, said: \u201cWe find the council at fault for not giving its independent tree panel all its reasons for wanting to remove this tree and for a misleading reply to an enquiry from Ms C. \u201cWe consider the faults have caused uncertainty about whether the tree needs removing.

A Sheffield council spokesperson said: \u201cWe will undertake the agreed actions within the timescales outlined in the ombudsman report and consider whether any lessons can be learnt as a result.\u201d Earlier this month seven campaigners who were wrongfully detained while protesting against tree felling in the city were awarded a \u00a324,300 payout by South Yorkshire police.

      "bodyText": "A prison governor has been ordered to undergo training after delivering two unlawful verdicts in jail adjudications that were watched by more than a million TV viewers. The verdicts have been quashed and all adjudications the governor has made are to be reviewed. The governor also told a prisoner on camera that staff who felt threatened by inmates were \u201callowed to strike them\u201d, but failed to make clear that this was only in a situation when there is no other option. The adjudications were seen in the final episode of the Channel 4 documentary Prison, a three-part series about Durham prison, broadcast on 14 January. The episode focused on rising violence at the jail and was watched by 1.4 million people. The head of the Prison and Probation Service admitted the governor\u2019s failings in a written response to a complaint from a prisoners charity. The final episode of Prison included details of an incident in which staff put an inmate on a basic regime and removed his television from his cell. The inmate, Tommy Calder, said staff attacked him as they took away his TV. A prison officer said Calder kicked him and he retaliated by punching him. The incident was not filmed, but footage was shown of Calder being led away from his cell by nine prison officers. He was wearing only underpants and his face was badly marked, with one eye closed. The incident resulted in an investigation into the prisoner\u2019s allegations that he had been assaulted by staff and adjudication proceedings against him for alleged possession of a weapon and assault on a member of staff. The governor found the prisoner guilty on both counts. In relation to the first charge, she said: \u201cYou have given me no reason to doubt the word of the officer, so I find the charge proven.\u201d In relation to the alleged assault, the governor said: \u201cOn the balance of probabilities, I find the charge proven.\u201d Balance of probabilities is the burden of proof required in civil cases. The prison service instruction 47/2011, dealing with adjudications, states: \u201cThe adjudicator will dismiss the charge if not satisfied that it has been proven beyond reasonable doubt.\u201d Beyond reasonable doubt is the burden of proof required in criminal cases. Calder asked the governor if she had seen pictures of his injuries. She replied: \u201cThe thing about the use of force is that it is not always nice and clean and tidy and sometimes when an officer feels threatened he is allowed to strike you and that is what the officer did.\u201d The prison service order states that force is lawful if it is necessary and proportionate to the seriousness of the situation. It warns that blows to the head can lead to skull fracture and/or brain haemorrhage.

It was the premiere of a monumental new production of Philip Glass\u2019s Akhnaten<em> </em>by Phelim McDermott, for English National Opera.

And he was right. With the cold air of the theatre on my scalp, with my hairless arms feeling almost wet, and with the inner strength I had to find in the vulnerability of being completely naked in public, I did feel I could get somewhere deeper with my portrayal of the Egyptian pharaoh. Over the course of three hours, with a score that is largely non-narrative, I have found I must fully inhabit the role to connect with the people on stage and in the auditorium, and to make the music speak.

When Phelim first announced that there would be juggling in his production, I thought to myself, \u201cOh well, so much for any hopes of success\u201d. Boy, was I wrong. Sean Gandini and his vituouso troupe throw balls in threes and fours, sometimes mirroring our conductor Karen Kamensek\u2019s precise gestures, and sometimes serving as a satisfying counterpoint. The juggling somehow makes Glass\u2019s music visible. What\u2019s more, the jugglers added such a joyous spirit to the process that we sometimes had to contain the elation. Early on, Karen and the rest of us were forbidden from making any more ball jokes, and not just because there was a countertenor in the show.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always been disciplined in my craft, but the quantity and frequency of the singing makes this an Olympics for me. I sing a Handel aria every morning before I tackle Akhnaten. There\u2019s a striking parity between the two composers, centuries and continents apart. Both use repetition to illuminate an internal narrative. I\u2019ve even started referring to Handel as a proto-minimalist. And with the two composers echoing in my mind this last year, I was able <a href=\"https://deccagold.lnk.to/ARC\">to make an album</a> that put them side by side.</p> <p>Once you learn to sing Glass\u2019s music, you also have to learn how to remember it! I thought the opera\u2019s ancient Egyptian text would be hard to master, but with enough careful translation and study, it proved surmountable. What took longer however were the extended passages only on \u201cah\u201d, like the first scene in Act II, ten minutes of vocalising with phrases that repeat once or twice, have a small change in the rhythm or melody, and then that new phrase repeats, and on and on. I started by trying to chart out repeats numerically, but there were so many variations that my chart wound up looking like trigonometry. So the only way to make it stick was to sing the whole thing every day for about four months. I still go through that scene in my head while on the treadmill the morning of each and every show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ec7d43c2d482d9717b9239a1c9805ad0f61d8136\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec7d43c2d482d9717b9239a1c9805ad0f61d8136/2_0_747_747/500.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Glass joins Anthony Roth Costanzo at curtain call\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Glass joins Anthony Roth Costanzo at curtain call</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rigours aren\u2019t only vocal. I have to be in prime shape for two reasons. The incredibly slow movement on stage requires control of every muscle in my body; and if <em>you</em> were going to be naked in front of thousands of people every night, wouldn\u2019t you go to the gym? Say goodbye to carbs, and hello to a new six-day-a-week gym regimen. In fact I have the show to thank for discovering electrical muscle stimulation, which uses electric current to amplify your workout and actually builds muscles much faster than I could on my own. I liked it so much that I gathered investors and started <a href=\"https://epulsefitness.com/\">one of the first EMS companies in America</a> (seriously). If you can\u2019t tell, this opera has had a real impact on my life.</p> <p>All of the discipline \u2013 mental, vocal, physical \u2013 becomes a kind of ritual. It has changed the way I perform, not only in this show, but in almost everything I do. It\u2019s one of those rare cases where life begins to imitate art. In today\u2019s unfathomable world, instead of cutting back on art, we should be making more of it. In the best of hands, in the worst of times, art can model the possibility of how we relate to each other, and to ourselves.</p> <p>\u2022 Akhnaten is at <a href=\"https://www.eno.org/whats-on/akhnaten/\">English National Opera, London Coliseum</a>, until 7 March.

So the only way to make it stick was to sing the whole thing every day for about four months. I still go through that scene in my head while on the treadmill the morning of each and every show. The rigours aren\u2019t only vocal. I have to be in prime shape for two reasons. The incredibly slow movement on stage requires control of every muscle in my body; and if you were going to be naked in front of thousands of people every night, wouldn\u2019t you go to the gym? Say goodbye to carbs, and hello to a new six-day-a-week gym regimen. In fact I have the show to thank for discovering electrical muscle stimulation, which uses electric current to amplify your workout and actually builds muscles much faster than I could on my own. I liked it so much that I gathered investors and started one of the first EMS companies in America (seriously). If you can\u2019t tell, this opera has had a real impact on my life. All of the discipline \u2013 mental, vocal, physical \u2013 becomes a kind of ritual. It has changed the way I perform, not only in this show, but in almost everything I do. It\u2019s one of those rare cases where life begins to imitate art. In today\u2019s unfathomable world, instead of cutting back on art, we should be making more of it. In the best of hands, in the worst of times, art can model the possibility of how we relate to each other, and to ourselves. \u2022 Akhnaten is at English National Opera, London Coliseum, until 7 March.

      "body": "<p>The Dutch artist David Louf, who goes by <a href=\"http://mrjune.com/\">Mr June</a>, is the person behind these striking 3D hexagon murals, which have appeared on walls from Berlin to the Bronx.</p> <p>Louf grew up in Amsterdam immersed in hip-hop and graffiti, and turned to graphic design as an adult. Eight years ago he moved back to street art and now combines his skills to create vibrant, abstract murals on buildings across the world.</p> <p>The walls are Louf\u2019s canvas, and he plays off different structures and shapes on the buildings. His only restriction is his fascination for hexagons.</p> <p>\u201cMy walls are more the playground version of that study of the hexagon form,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my mind I have the hexagon, and I just react on the wall or on the element of the wall. That\u2019s the base and beginning of every painting I make.\u201d</p> <p>The colourful murals distort the way the viewer understands architecture and the building\u2019s structure. \u201cThe most exciting element is that every canvas of every wall is a different one, it\u2019s a different shape. The elements are also different.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a beauty about working outside, he says. \u201cI always say that I make public art \u2013 the fact that people can see it no matter who they are.\u201d</p> <p><em>Guardian Cities brings together the best in urban photography on Instagram at<a href=\"https://instagram.com/guardiancities/\">@guardiancities</a>.

      "bodyText": "The Dutch artist David Louf, who goes by Mr June, is the person behind these striking 3D hexagon murals, which have appeared on walls from Berlin to the Bronx. Louf grew up in Amsterdam immersed in hip-hop and graffiti, and turned to graphic design as an adult. Eight years ago he moved back to street art and now combines his skills to create vibrant, abstract murals on buildings across the world. The walls are Louf\u2019s canvas, and he plays off different structures and shapes on the buildings. His only restriction is his fascination for hexagons. \u201cMy walls are more the playground version of that study of the hexagon form,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my mind I have the hexagon, and I just react on the wall or on the element of the wall. That\u2019s the base and beginning of every painting I make.\u201d The colourful murals distort the way the viewer understands architecture and the building\u2019s structure. \u201cThe most exciting element is that every canvas of every wall is a different one, it\u2019s a different shape. The elements are also different.\u201d There\u2019s a beauty about working outside, he says. \u201cI always say that I make public art \u2013 the fact that people can see it no matter who they are.\u201d Guardian Cities brings together the best in urban photography on Instagram at@guardiancities.

With negotiations over possible changes to the Irish border backstop at a crucial stage, parliament needed to hold its nerve, the prime minister said, adding that a Brexit motion to be debated on Thursday would reiterate those intentions. However, in response, Jeremy Corbyn said May had offered MPs only \u201cmore excuses and more delays\u201d. By rejecting Labour\u2019s idea of customs union membership, May had shown she only wanted to \u201cdeliberately run down the clock and play chicken with people\u2019s livelihoods\u201d, the opposition leader said. May\u2019s statement followed talks last week in Brussels where she sought legally binding changes to the backstop, as outlined in an amendment to a Brexit motion passed in the Commons at the end of last month. The amendment, tabled by the Tory backbencher Graham Brady, \u201cgave me a clear mandate and sent an unequivocal message to the European Union\u201d, May said. Having discussed it with the head of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, May told MPs: \u201cAs expected, President Juncker maintained the EU\u2019s position that they will not reopen the withdrawal agreement.\u201d Despite that, the prime minister signalled no changes to her plans, just an extended deadline. \u201cSo our work continues,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving secured an agreement with the European Union for further talks, we now need some time to complete that process.

Brendan McCarthy, 50, changed his pleas to guilty at Wolverhampton crown court on Tuesday after a two-year legal fight in which he unsuccessfully claimed that the consent of his customers provided him with a lawful defence. McCarthy, from Bushbury in Wolverhampton, carried out the ear removal at his studio in 2015 without using anaesthetic, three years after he split a woman\u2019s tongue with a scalpel and removed another customer\u2019s nipple. When he first appeared in court in 2017, he denied six counts relating to the three procedures on the basis that the procedures were consensual. But the judge, Amjad Nawaz, ruled that the registered tattooist could not use his clients\u2019 written permission as a defence. Nawaz based his decision on precedent set by previous prosecutions, including one in which a husband branded his wife\u2019s buttocks with a hot knife. McCarthy took his case to the court of appeal but it was rejected. In their 12-page ruling, the three appeal court judges, including the lord chief justice of England and Wales, accepted that the ear removal had been done quite well but said it was not in the public interest that a person could wound another for no good reason.

The treatment of housing costs is also a problem, as RPI uses a combination of mortgage interest payments and house prices as a proxy for housing depreciation. In a period of rapidly rising house prices, inflation accelerates ahead of a basket of goods and services bought by most consumers.</p>\n    <p><b>CPI<br></b>An internationally recognised calculation of inflation, it monitors the rising cost of goods and services according to an agreed formula that statisticians believe is more reliable and robust than that used with RPI. However, CPI also has its detractors because it excludes all housing costs.</p>\n    <p><b>CPIH<br></b>The ONS has included housing costs in its CPI calculation to make CPIH its preferred method of calculating rising prices. It uses rents as a proxy for housing costs. In recent years rents have fallen, especially in London, dragging down the CPIH rate below CPI.

The persistent use of both CPI and RPI figures has led to accusations of \u201cinflation shopping\u201d by the government, cherrypicking which index to use according to how much it will cost the public purse. From May, the returns for savers from National Savings &amp; Investments index-linked savings certificates will be linked to CPI rather than RPI. NS&amp;I is backed by the Treasury and said the move would result in a saving to the taxpayer of \u00a3610m over the next five years. Lord Forsyth, the head of the economic affairs committee, warned the UKSA could be in breach of its statutory duties unless it fixed RPI. \u201cThe authority told us they had not asked the chancellor to approve fixes to RPI because they expected he would say no. The Treasury said they could not act because no request had been submitted. This is a ridiculous merry-go-round,\u201d he said. A spokesman for the UKSA said it was carefully assessing the report from the committee and would respond fully in due course. A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cWe recognise the flaws in the way RPI is measured and have made progress in moving away from using it. However, given the extensive use of RPI across the public and private sectors, further moves away from the measure are complex and potentially costly. \u201cAs set out at Budget, the government\u2019s objective is that CPIH will become its headline measure over time and that it will reduce the use of RPI when and where practicable.\u201d",

The world goes on, teeming with stories and individuals, people stepping on and off the kerb. Diane Arbus: In the Beginning is at the Hayward Gallery, London, from 13 February to 6 May",

I\u2019m hurt that this country doesn\u2019t feel that BME women are important enough to deserve a safe place for us to live, breathe and work in \u2013 whether we\u2019re seeking refuge from an individual violent partner within the same town, or whether we\u2019re seeking refuge because another country has become unsafe for us.\u201d</p> \n<p>What does Larasi make of the recent furore over comments made by the chief executive of domestic abuse charity Women\u2019s Aid, Katie Ghose, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/07/womens-aid-chief-kate-ghose-steps-down-public-praising-ukip\" title=\"\">in praise of Ukip?</a> Videos shared by feminist activists on social media show Ghose, in her former role as the head of the Electoral Reform Society, complimenting Nigel Farage and MP Douglas Carswell at the 2015 Ukip conference and sharing a platform at a subsequent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/25/katie-hopkins-wouldnt-mind-if-house-of-lords-was-sealed-up-and-gassed\" title=\"\">fringe event with Katie Hopkins</a>.</p> \n<p>Last week, Women\u2019s Aid announced that Ghose had <a href=\"https://www.womensaid.org.uk/significant-change-at-womens-aid/\" title=\"\">stepped down, by mutual agreement</a>. But wasn\u2019t it her job at the ERS to talk to all sorts of political parties and commentators about the need for electoral reform? And Ghose has spoken of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/13/katie-ghose-risky-proposals-cuts-refuges-close\" title=\"\">racism she faced</a> growing up with an Indian father and a white British mother .</p> \n<p>Larasi, a former joint chair of Women\u2019s Aid, believes the charity needs to directly address the concerns it raised about racism raised. She says: \u201cAs a partner organisation, we feel it\u2019s really important for Women\u2019s Aid to make a statement about where it stands with regards to equality issues, rather than saying it was a mutually agreed stepping down. As someone leading a BME women\u2019s organisation, I want some reassurances that Women\u2019s Aid are committed to working from a strong intersectional approach. I hope Women\u2019s Aid come out soon and says where it stands on issues about race.\u201d</p> \n<p>This clarity is necessary given the <a href=\"https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/2f475d_9cab044d7d25404d85da289b70978237.pdf\" title=\"\">swingeing cuts to dedicated BME services</a> which has led to their work being taken over by \u201cmainstream\u201d providers often lacking specialist knowledge and expertise, says Larasi. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about something like 50% of the BME services that existed in terms of refuge provision 25 years ago not being there any more. BME services are still being closed down and not just because of competitive tendering for state funding, but because our sisters fail to see that we are important enough for them to act in solidarity with us. Instead, they\u2019re going to a market-driven approach where they compete against BME services rather than working with us.

Although there was a strong sense of collectivism, she says there were always fractures around race. \u201cI remember being at one conference and causing quite a lot of upset around why one of the first studies looking at BME women\u2019s experiences in mainstream services wasn\u2019t being prioritised, and why Women\u2019s Aid hadn\u2019t pushed it to the forefront,\u201d she says. \u201cI joined the Women\u2019s Aid board all those years ago because I wanted us to do better things around BME women and BME services.\u201d</p> \n<p>Larasi, who has an MA in culture, diaspora and ethnicity from Birkbeck, University of London, says that she immediately felt more at home at Imkaan because of its intersectional approach to sexism and racism. During her decade in charge of the network, Larisa has co-written reports on best practice for helping BME victims and survivors of violence against women and girls, using research showing how some providers\u2019 racial stereotyping of certain ethnic groups as more dangerous, patriarchal, or inclined towards extremism, deters BME women from seeking help.</p> \n<p>She also notes that young BME women report that sexual harassment against them involves racist slurs, but complain that this is not recognised by generic women\u2019s services. \u201cI know as a woman who\u2019s African-Caribbean, and who is visible by the way that I dress as a lesbian, that the way that I\u2019m targeted [for harassment] plays out in a particular way,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I go to a service and they tell me that they don\u2019t see colour or colour doesn\u2019t matter, then I\u2019m like, OK. That actually matters to me!\u201d</p> \n<p>What about government policy? \u201cNo government has ever got it right with respect to BME services, whether that\u2019s the benevolence of the left or the exclusions of the right.\u201d She says the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/27/major-gaps-and-missteps-in-domestic-abuse-bill\" title=\"\">draft domestic abuse bill</a> fails to comprehensively address all forms of violence facing women and girls, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/may/28/thousands-enslaved-in-forced-marriages-across-uk-investigation-finds\" title=\"\">forced marriage</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2018/dec/06/dont-expect-a-survivor-to-tell-you-her-experience-of-undergoing-fgm\" title=\"\">female genital mutilation</a>, which BME women are at greater risk of. \u201cFor us as BME women, knowing that the vast majority of people in leadership don\u2019t truly represent us and don\u2019t truly prioritise our concerns makes it very difficult,\u201d says Larasi.</p> \n<p>Her renown as a feminist campaigner was reflected last year when, in an effort to raise awareness of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/18/sisters-this-is-our-moment-to-say-times-up\" title=\"\">#TimesUp campaign</a> against sexual harassment, she was among a select group of gender and racial justice advocates invited by Hollywood actors to be their plus-one at the Golden Globes. Larasi walked the red carpet wearing a tuxedo and boots <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2018/jan/08/we-stand-in-solidarity-emma-watson-and-marai-larasi-on-golden-globes-red-carpet-video\" title=\"\">with Harry Potter star Emma Watson</a>. But she admits fearing that her peers would think she had sold out. \u201cI had a complete meltdown, like, \u2018Are you mad? I can\u2019t do that!\u2019\u201d Larasi says, adding that it was her children who convinced her to take part. \u201cThey were quite pointed: \u2018This is about what you\u2019re committed to, and you kind of need to go represent, mum.\u2019 (Larasi subsequently joined <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TessaThompson_x/status/965248836443803649\" title=\"\">Thor: Ragnarok star Tessa Thompson</a> to promote #TimesUp at last year\u2019s Bafta awards.)</p> \n<p>What advice does Larasi have for women\u2019s services that want to better serve BME women? She says they cannot start from the premise that the right version of womanhood is white and middle class, with black women and lesbians seen as add-ons, she says, noting that her own advocacy is rooted in black feminism. They need a strong commitment to equality, with the most marginalised groups at the centre of their strategy and in decision-making positions.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t do that, we\u2019re just reinforcing the power structures that already exist. We can\u2019t have social justice squeezed out of our work.\u201d</p> \n<h2><br><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Age</strong>: 49</p> \n<p><strong>Lives</strong>: North London</p> \n<p><strong>Family</strong>: In a relationship, one daughter and one son</p> \n<p><strong>Education</strong>: Clarendon college high school, Jamaica, and City and East London College, London; Howard University, Washington DC (psychology); Birkbeck, University of London (culture, diaspora and ethnicity MA)</p> \n<p><strong>Career</strong>: 2011-present: joint-chair, End Violence Against Women coalition; 2009-2019: executive director, Imkaan; 2004-13: joint chair, Women\u2019s Aid; 2000-2009: chief executive, the NIA project; 1996-1999: manager of women\u2019s refuge provision, the NIA project.</p> \n<p><strong>Interests</strong>: Reading Alice Walker and Afrofuturist literature</p>",

She also notes that young BME women report that sexual harassment against them involves racist slurs, but complain that this is not recognised by generic women\u2019s services. \u201cI know as a woman who\u2019s African-Caribbean, and who is visible by the way that I dress as a lesbian, that the way that I\u2019m targeted [for harassment] plays out in a particular way,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I go to a service and they tell me that they don\u2019t see colour or colour doesn\u2019t matter, then I\u2019m like, OK. That actually matters to me!\u201d What about government policy? \u201cNo government has ever got it right with respect to BME services, whether that\u2019s the benevolence of the left or the exclusions of the right.\u201d She says the government\u2019s draft domestic abuse bill fails to comprehensively address all forms of violence facing women and girls, including forced marriage and female genital mutilation, which BME women are at greater risk of. \u201cFor us as BME women, knowing that the vast majority of people in leadership don\u2019t truly represent us and don\u2019t truly prioritise our concerns makes it very difficult,\u201d says Larasi. Her renown as a feminist campaigner was reflected last year when, in an effort to raise awareness of the #TimesUp campaign against sexual harassment, she was among a select group of gender and racial justice advocates invited by Hollywood actors to be their plus-one at the Golden Globes. Larasi walked the red carpet wearing a tuxedo and boots with Harry Potter star Emma Watson. But she admits fearing that her peers would think she had sold out. \u201cI had a complete meltdown, like, \u2018Are you mad? I can\u2019t do that!\u2019\u201d Larasi says, adding that it was her children who convinced her to take part. \u201cThey were quite pointed: \u2018This is about what you\u2019re committed to, and you kind of need to go represent, mum.\u2019 (Larasi subsequently joined Thor: Ragnarok star Tessa Thompson to promote #TimesUp at last year\u2019s Bafta awards.) What advice does Larasi have for women\u2019s services that want to better serve BME women? She says they cannot start from the premise that the right version of womanhood is white and middle class, with black women and lesbians seen as add-ons, she says, noting that her own advocacy is rooted in black feminism. They need a strong commitment to equality, with the most marginalised groups at the centre of their strategy and in decision-making positions. \u201cIf we can\u2019t do that, we\u2019re just reinforcing the power structures that already exist. We can\u2019t have social justice squeezed out of our work.\u201d Curriculum vitae Age: 49 Lives: North London Family: In a relationship, one daughter and one son Education: Clarendon college high school, Jamaica, and City and East London College, London; Howard University, Washington DC (psychology); Birkbeck, University of London (culture, diaspora and ethnicity MA) Career: 2011-present: joint-chair, End Violence Against Women coalition; 2009-2019: executive director, Imkaan; 2004-13: joint chair, Women\u2019s Aid; 2000-2009: chief executive, the NIA project; 1996-1999: manager of women\u2019s refuge provision, the NIA project.

With a production budget estimated in the $150-200m range, Alita, directed by Robert Rodriguez, still faces a long road to profitability. Worldwide gross so far is $32m, with key territories including North America, China and Japan yet to come.</p> <p>If previews are discounted from the Alita total, second-place honours at the UK box office really belong to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/31/how-to-train-your-dragon-the-hidden-world-review-jay-baruchel-america-ferrara\">How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World</a>, with \u00a32.75m.

      "bodyText": "The winner: The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part Taking in \u00a34.2m from 572 cinemas, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part has knocked How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World off the top of the UK box office after a single week\u2019s reign. The Warner Animation title debuted significantly below the UK opening numbers achieved five years ago by The Lego Movie (\u00a38.5m including \u00a32.16m in previews). The number was also below the \u00a35.32m debut for How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World last week. Although Warner Bros waited five years to present the sequel to The Lego Movie, the studio also served up The Lego Batman Movie in February 2017 and The Lego Ninjago Movie seven months later. Cinemagoers may be feeling that four Lego-themed films in five years is more than generous. UK totals for the three previous movies are: \u00a334.4m, \u00a327.4m (Batman) and \u00a39.73m (Ninjago). The runner-up: Alita: Battle Angel With \u00a33.2m at UK cinemas, including previews of \u00a3771,000, Alita: Battle Angel lands in second place. Distributor 20th Century Fox will probably view this as a decent result, since the film did not benefit from much pre-existing awareness in the UK of its origins: Yukito Kishiro\u2019s graphic novel series Gunnm. Alita had been in development with producer James Cameron since at least 2003, but was sidelined in favour of projects such as Avatar. With a production budget estimated in the $150-200m range, Alita, directed by Robert Rodriguez, still faces a long road to profitability. Worldwide gross so far is $32m, with key territories including North America, China and Japan yet to come. If previews are discounted from the Alita total, second-place honours at the UK box office really belong to How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, with \u00a32.75m. The total after 10 days is a decent \u00a39.6m, with the February half-term school holiday ahead of it. The audience winner: Green Book Enjoying the gentlest decline of any film in the UK Top 10 \u2013 or Top 20, for that matter \u2013 is Peter Farrelly\u2019s Green Book. Declining just 13% from its opening session, the 1962-set road trip buddy movie grossed \u00a31.7m at the weekend, pushing the total after 10 days to \u00a33.62m. Audience reviews on the film look good: the IMDb user rating is a strong 8.3/10. Green Book predictably missed out on the biggest prizes at the Bafta film awards on Sunday \u2013 losing best film to Roma and best actor to Rami Malek for Bohemian Rhapsody \u2013 but successfully fought off a relentless challenge from Can You Ever Forgive Me?\u2019s Richard E Grant to scoop best supporting actor for Mahershala Ali. The awards season smackdown The battle for fans of quality indie cinema intensified at the weekend with the release of Barry Jenkins\u2019s If Beale Street Could Talk, Kenneth Branagh\u2019s All Is True and Joel Edgerton\u2019s Boy Erased. The three new films faced the challenge that target audiences are already being catered to by the likes of Green Book, Mary Queen of Scots, Vice, Can You Ever Forgive Me?, The Favourite and Stan &amp; Ollie. With all these titles \u2013 old and new \u2013 currently in the UK Top 20, this was a nine-way fight for essentially the same set of cinemagoers. All Is True had the top opening among the three new films, albeit boosted by a more generous cinema count. It debuted with \u00a3267,000 from 252 cinemas, including \u00a327,000 in previews. If Beale Street Could Talk delivered a much higher site average thanks to Entertainment One\u2019s release into a tight 52 venues. The James Baldwin adaptation began with \u00a3252,000, or \u00a3170,000 excluding previews. Finally, Boy Erased, starring Lucas Hedges as a gay young man sent to a sexual orientation conversion programme by his religious parents, was a predictable casualty, beginning with \u00a3119,000 from 116 cinemas, including negligible previews. The drama picked up a couple of Golden Globe nominations, including one for Hedges, but overall has not figured strongly in this year\u2019s awards races. Collectively, the nine award-bait films \u2013 which are all in the UK Top 20 \u2013 grossed \u00a33.28m at the weekend. Exactly a year ago, the equivalent titles (Darkest Hour, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, The Post, Phantom Thread, The Mercy and Downsizing) grossed \u00a32.86m in the second weekend of February. The Shape of Water, Lady Bird and I, Tonya subsequently arrived to give the 2018 awards season box office a boost. The market Overall, the market is a modest 8% down on the equivalent weekend from a year ago, which was led by franchise finale Fifty Shades Freed. It\u2019s the fifth weekend in a row where box office takings fell below the results achieved in 2018. The news can only get worse, as last year mid-February saw the arrival of Black Panther.

      "bodyText": "Russia is planning to temporarily disconnect from the internet as part of what it says is an experiment to test its cyberdefence capabilities. According to a report on the Russian news site RBC, the planned disconnection is intended to analyse the country\u2019s preparedness for a draft law mandating a \u201csovereign\u201d internet. Under the draft law, all internal internet traffic would be carried within the country\u2019s own networks. Any traffic that leaves Russia would be forced to go thorough registered exchange points, subject to regulation by the state communications regulator Roskomnadzor. Ostensibly the goal of the legislation is to protect the Russian internet from the US, which has an offensive cybersecurity strategy and lists Russia as one of the major sources of hacking attacks. However, many observers think the creation of a Russian intranet is a further step towards a goal of duplicating the Great Firewall of China to restrict the access of the country\u2019s internet users to content deemed harmful by the authorities. Russia has already moved to block webpages run by opposition figures such as Alexei Navalny, a prominent Kremlin critic. Agora, a Russian human rights group, said in a report this month that Russian internet freedoms had fallen fivefold in the past 12 months. In the short term the planned disconnection is largely intended to assuage the fears of domestic internet service providers that the draft legislation could impose huge costs on them and harm the reliability of the Russian internet. Natalya Kasperskaya, the president of the information security working group that has recommended the experiment, told RBC that the law \u201chas good goals, but the mechanisms for its implementation raise many questions and disputes. Moreover, the methods of its implementation have not yet been precisely defined.\u201d Cost ranks high among the ISPs\u2019 concerns. RBC cites an estimate of 134bn roubles (\u00a31.5bn) to compensate telecom operators each year, plus another 25bn roubles to create the register of exchanges required by Roskomnadzor. Even that may not work: the draft law requires Roskomodzor to be kept informed of the entire scheme of every ISP\u2019s network and traffic routing in real time, something the operators argue is not possible.

Andrei Klishas, a senator and one of the authors of the draft bill, which was approved in its first reading in parliament on Tuesday, said the government had already earmarked 20bn roubles to cover the costs of ensuring Russia\u2019s cybersecurity in the event of foreign aggression.

The people at the heart of the scandal say it started as a \u201cjoke\u201d, and stemmed from a desire to share some \u201cblack humour\u201d. If that is the case, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/11/french-boys-club-of-journalists-accused-of-bullying-women-online\" title=\"\">the #ligueduLOL controversy</a> has turned out to be something much darker, and has exposed the everyday abuse that women and minorities face on social media.</p> \n<p>The Ligue du LOL is the name of a closed Facebook group in which about 30 young and successful journalists, media professionals and early-day Twitter influencers allegedly coordinated cyberbullying, trolling and Twitter campaigns against other social media users (mostly women, as well as feminist and LGBT activists) between 2009 and 2012. Some of them continued their activities for years after the group was closed.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/11/french-boys-club-of-journalists-accused-of-bullying-women-online\">French \u2018boys\u2019 club\u2019 of journalists accused of bullying women online</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The case resurfaced last week when French newspaper Lib\u00e9ration\u2019s fact-checking website Check News <a href=\"https://www.liberation.fr/checknews/2019/02/08/la-ligue-du-lol-a-t-elle-vraiment-existe-et-harcele-des-feministes-sur-les-reseaux-sociaux_1708185\" title=\"\">published a story</a> titled \u201cDid the Ligue du LOL really exist?\u201d Since then, other stories of cyberbullying, including the existence of messaging groups within/at several newspapers in which sexist and homophobic comments were exchanged, revealed the persistence of a culture of intimidation in sections of the French media.</p> \n<p>There are signs that things might be about to change. Since the story emerged, dozens of men and women have shared experiences of humiliation, lost confidence and destroyed career opportunities. YouTuber and video journalist Florence Porcel <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FlorencePorcel/status/1093931424896430080\" title=\"\">accused members of the Ligue</a> of harassing her in her workplace. \u201cReading so much filth about me on social media convinced me that I was worth nothing,\u201d tweeted former web journalist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/capucinepiot2/status/1094017128578105350\" title=\"\">Capucine Piot</a>.</p> \n<p>Government members have also weighed in on the debate. The secretary of state for equality, Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarleneSchiappa/status/1094554034202136577\" title=\"\">tweeted her support</a> for the victims of the group. Mounir Mahjoubi, in charge of France\u2019s digital affairs, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mounir/status/1094693124729909249\" title=\"\">described the controversy</a> as a \u201cstory of losers\u201d, of men \u201cwho thought they were the kings of the internet\u201d.</p> \n<p>The overwhelming response to the case has forced the media industry to face its moment of reckoning. Lib\u00e9ration, Huffington Post and Les Inrocks, among others, have <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2019/02/11/ligue-du-lol-un-journaliste-de-liberation-mis-a-pied-a-titre-conservatoire_5422027_4408996.html\" title=\"\">adopted disciplinary sanctions</a> against employees and vowed to conduct investigations. Other news outlets announced they would end their collaboration with alleged harassers. And, as could be expected, most of the accused have issued some form of apology.</p> \n<p>But the victims of online harassment and cyberbullying need more than apologies and individual sanctions. They need legal protection and a cultural shift away from the toxic masculinity that continues to pervade too many newsrooms.</p> \n<p>Olivier Tesquet, a journalist at T\u00e9l\u00e9rama and former member of the Ligue, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oliviertesquet/status/1094557403838930945\" title=\"\">summed up</a> the culture that pervaded a largely male-dominated group: \u201cThe Ligue du LOL was a \u2018boys\u2019 club\u2019.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">#MeToo movement</a>, despite facing a mixed reception in the country, reactivated a long-lasting debate about gender equality and against harassment.

      "bodyText": "The French media world has been in the grip of a deep crisis for the past few days. The people at the heart of the scandal say it started as a \u201cjoke\u201d, and stemmed from a desire to share some \u201cblack humour\u201d. If that is the case, the #ligueduLOL controversy has turned out to be something much darker, and has exposed the everyday abuse that women and minorities face on social media. The Ligue du LOL is the name of a closed Facebook group in which about 30 young and successful journalists, media professionals and early-day Twitter influencers allegedly coordinated cyberbullying, trolling and Twitter campaigns against other social media users (mostly women, as well as feminist and LGBT activists) between 2009 and 2012. Some of them continued their activities for years after the group was closed. The case resurfaced last week when French newspaper Lib\u00e9ration\u2019s fact-checking website Check News published a story titled \u201cDid the Ligue du LOL really exist?\u201d Since then, other stories of cyberbullying, including the existence of messaging groups within/at several newspapers in which sexist and homophobic comments were exchanged, revealed the persistence of a culture of intimidation in sections of the French media. There are signs that things might be about to change. Since the story emerged, dozens of men and women have shared experiences of humiliation, lost confidence and destroyed career opportunities. YouTuber and video journalist Florence Porcel accused members of the Ligue of harassing her in her workplace. \u201cReading so much filth about me on social media convinced me that I was worth nothing,\u201d tweeted former web journalist Capucine Piot. Government members have also weighed in on the debate. The secretary of state for equality, Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa, tweeted her support for the victims of the group. Mounir Mahjoubi, in charge of France\u2019s digital affairs, described the controversy as a \u201cstory of losers\u201d, of men \u201cwho thought they were the kings of the internet\u201d. The overwhelming response to the case has forced the media industry to face its moment of reckoning. Lib\u00e9ration, Huffington Post and Les Inrocks, among others, have adopted disciplinary sanctions against employees and vowed to conduct investigations. Other news outlets announced they would end their collaboration with alleged harassers. And, as could be expected, most of the accused have issued some form of apology. But the victims of online harassment and cyberbullying need more than apologies and individual sanctions. They need legal protection and a cultural shift away from the toxic masculinity that continues to pervade too many newsrooms. Olivier Tesquet, a journalist at T\u00e9l\u00e9rama and former member of the Ligue, summed up the culture that pervaded a largely male-dominated group: \u201cThe Ligue du LOL was a \u2018boys\u2019 club\u2019. You were better off in than out, at least that\u2019s what I told myself.\u201d There is momentum in France for change. The #MeToo movement, despite facing a mixed reception in the country, reactivated a long-lasting debate about gender equality and against harassment. Last year, footage of a man punching a woman outside a Parisian cafe went viral, and increased support for tougher sanctions on sexist abuse and harassment. The French government has acted on this change of public mood and has set out to tackle harassment online and offline. Last May, France passed a bill introducing fines for sexist abuse and street harassment \u2013 which included a definition of group harassment. It is also set to adopt new legislation against hate speech online later this year, which will put pressure on social media companies to remove hateful content more quickly and step up their efforts against cyberbullying. Whether the #ligueduLOL case will become the media industry\u2019s #MeToo movement remains uncertain, but it has opened a long-overdue debate about the culture of toxic masculinity and harassment in parts of the French media. \u2022 C\u00e9cile Guerin is a freelance French journalist based in London",

The work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, claims the new system is <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tory-amber-rudd-suggests-heartbreaking-13843492\" title=\"\">compassionate</a> (even though she now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/11/universal-credit-rollout-linked-to-rising-food-bank-use-amber-rudd-admits\" title=\"\">admits it drives food bank use</a>) and the bad press it gets is \u201cdown to one or two particular individuals\u201d. The DWP likes to say universal credit works well for most claimants, that it proactively fixes \u201cteething problems\u201d as they emerge. Its</p> <p>own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/01/universal-credit-scores-lowest-for-satisfaction-in-benefits-survey\" title=\"\">claimant survey</a>, published last week, tells a different story. It finds that one in five claimants weren\u2019t happy with their experience of the new benefit, while one in 10 reported they were \u201cvery dissatisfied\u201d \u2013 equivalent at the time to 60,000 claimants (it would be now nearer 140,000). That\u2019s not most claimants; but it is a high margin for error (and this survey was before the more complex \u201cfull service\u201d cases were fully accommodated).</p> <p>The DWP\u2019s claim that it is on a constant roll of \u201ctest and learn\u201d also feels unpersuasive. It has made relatively minor changes designed to make the system more manageable for claimants, often when under the full glare of the media and backbench Tory MP concern, or when a judge rules that the policy it has hitherto been pursuing with implacable determination is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/14/disabled-men-on-universal-credit-discriminated-against-high-court-rules\" title=\"\">unlawful</a>. Politically, the DWP tone has changed from shrill denialism to Rudd\u2019s more equable and conciliatory approach, where at least there is an apparent recognition (as you would hope from an MP whose Hastings constituency has keenly felt the trauma of universal credit) that there are good reasons why the public has very little confidence in universal credit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef6acb9cc558a8b02145d1d03d78576a470ddaf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef6acb9cc558a8b02145d1d03d78576a470ddaf1/0_137_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trevor, Tamsyn and Tracey from Skint Britain: Friends Without Benefits.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trevor, Tamsyn and Tracey from Skint Britain: Friends Without Benefits.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Ansett/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But will Rudd go beyond piecemeal reform? So far, makeshift changes have had little effect. As Citizens Advice (CAB) pointed out this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/22/universal-credit-wait-reduced-to-five-weeks\" title=\"\">tweaks to universal credit</a> in the 2017 budget have made a \u201cdent\u201d in the problems, but not much else. Half of claimants who came to the CAB were at risk of eviction (many more than under the previous benefit system), with similar proportions in debt or struggling to eat or pay bills. Last month the high court ruled that universal credit\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/11/four-single-mothers-win-high-court-benefits-battle-against-dwp-universal-credit\" title=\"\">\u201codd\u201d and \u201cnonsensical\u201d policy</a> of rigidly enforced assessment periods, which can leave some working claimants hundreds of pounds out of pocket and reliant on food banks, is unlawful. It will take more than tinkering to solve this problem at the structural heart of universal credit.</p> <p>The big, fundamental flaws of universal credit remain: five weeks is far too long to make low-income claimants <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2016/jun/09/debt-and-food-banks-the-legacy-of-universal-credits-long-hello\" title=\"\">wait for payment</a> because it drives debt and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/07/universal-credit-flaws-pushing-claimants-towards-debt-and-eviction-warning\" title=\"\">rent arrears</a>; too many claimants will be worse off when they move on to universal credit (many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/15/claimants-will-pay-for-universal-credit-delay\" title=\"\">without transitional protection</a>); and the already miserly level of benefits, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/19/benefits-cuts-poorest-politics-media-cuts\" title=\"\">frozen</a> now for nearly three years, is simply not enough for people to live on.

      "bodyText": "You have to hand it to Nathan: benefit-sanctioned, hungry, and waiting weeks for the renewal of his universal credit payment, he takes the dog out into the fields and catches himself a rabbit for dinner. Back at home he and his partner, Abbey, skin it. They eat rabbit soup, the dog gets to chew on the rabbit head. There may be few jobs, the dole doesn\u2019t stretch far, and the price of baked beans has gone up; but starvation can be held at bay, he reckons, if you are prepared to hunt wild animals. David, 40, is also sanctioned. He\u2019s partially blind, and his GP said he shouldn\u2019t work. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) decreed that he can work, and stopped his benefits after he missed a jobcentre appointment (which he says he didn\u2019t know about). He\u2019s got \u00a35 to last him for the month. He can\u2019t afford a phone so he calls universal credit from the phone box in the street, sobbing as he\u2019s put on hold, listening to the endless, infuriating loop of Vivaldi\u2019s Four Seasons. \u201cIt\u2019s inhuman,\u201d is how he describes his treatment by the DWP. \u201cI feel like a bear that\u2019s prodded with an electric volt; a fucking dancing bear.\u201d Nathan and David appear in a three-part Channel 4 documentary Skint Britain: Friends Without Benefits, starting on Wednesday, which examines the impact of universal credit on a group of claimants in Hartlepool. There are no surprises for anyone who has followed its chaotic rollout. The film\u2019s subjects encounter distant, glacial bureaucracy; long waits for benefit payment; capricious, impoverishing sanctions; and practically no backstop against destitution. It\u2019s a timely reminder of the real-world, human impact of universal credit. The work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, claims the new system is compassionate (even though she now admits it drives food bank use) and the bad press it gets is \u201cdown to one or two particular individuals\u201d. The DWP likes to say universal credit works well for most claimants, that it proactively fixes \u201cteething problems\u201d as they emerge. Its own claimant survey, published last week, tells a different story. It finds that one in five claimants weren\u2019t happy with their experience of the new benefit, while one in 10 reported they were \u201cvery dissatisfied\u201d \u2013 equivalent at the time to 60,000 claimants (it would be now nearer 140,000). That\u2019s not most claimants; but it is a high margin for error (and this survey was before the more complex \u201cfull service\u201d cases were fully accommodated). The DWP\u2019s claim that it is on a constant roll of \u201ctest and learn\u201d also feels unpersuasive. It has made relatively minor changes designed to make the system more manageable for claimants, often when under the full glare of the media and backbench Tory MP concern, or when a judge rules that the policy it has hitherto been pursuing with implacable determination is unlawful. Politically, the DWP tone has changed from shrill denialism to Rudd\u2019s more equable and conciliatory approach, where at least there is an apparent recognition (as you would hope from an MP whose Hastings constituency has keenly felt the trauma of universal credit) that there are good reasons why the public has very little confidence in universal credit. But will Rudd go beyond piecemeal reform? So far, makeshift changes have had little effect. As Citizens Advice (CAB) pointed out this week, tweaks to universal credit in the 2017 budget have made a \u201cdent\u201d in the problems, but not much else. Half of claimants who came to the CAB were at risk of eviction (many more than under the previous benefit system), with similar proportions in debt or struggling to eat or pay bills. Last month the high court ruled that universal credit\u2019s \u201codd\u201d and \u201cnonsensical\u201d policy of rigidly enforced assessment periods, which can leave some working claimants hundreds of pounds out of pocket and reliant on food banks, is unlawful. It will take more than tinkering to solve this problem at the structural heart of universal credit. The big, fundamental flaws of universal credit remain: five weeks is far too long to make low-income claimants wait for payment because it drives debt and rent arrears; too many claimants will be worse off when they move on to universal credit (many without transitional protection); and the already miserly level of benefits, frozen now for nearly three years, is simply not enough for people to live on. Universal credit is intended to be a lifebelt, but is too often a deadweight, dragging people under. In the documentary, single mum Terri is looking for work after years spent caring for her daughter. It\u2019s not easy (she\u2019s on universal credit). She pops in for a bit of guidance from Linda, a fortune teller. \u201cI\u2019m not going to paint your life as a bed of roses, sweetheart, because it hasn\u2019t been,\u201d the urban seer divines. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to wish you all the luck in the world, because, I\u2019m going to be honest, you need it.\u201d \u2022 Patrick Butler is the Guardian\u2019s social policy editor",

All it requires is the expansion of this practice to all types of immigration, including refugees.

      "bodyText": "We should start talking about what we want to be About Brexit, Fintan O\u2019Toole is characteristically apt (25 January). The \u201cfog of fantasies\u201d and dysfunctional \u201cdemocracy\u201d can be found elsewhere as well, all the more in those whose embrace of neoliberalism has been pervasive, as in the US and, to a lesser degree, in Australia. As in Britain, the US and Australia bear historical baggage: in the former, bullshit and money; in the latter, dislocation and vacancy. Conservative US Democrats cling to a belief that a Trump vote was an endorsement of Trump per se; the Australian Labor party reads the entrails of polls and concludes that punters are racist/nationalist, and so they must be too. The real elephant in the room, climate change, has gone missing. O\u2019Toole\u2019s powerful conclusion, to \u201cend the mad race for a meaningless prize and start talking about who you want to be\u201d, is spot-on. Oddly, only in the US is there evidence that this is a real possibility with the extraordinary young talent elected in the midterms. Felix Prael San Diego, California, US Why don\u2019t we let citizens sponsor refugees? Millions of people are on the move; with burgeoning population growth, the future will see even more such migration. Recipient countries are alarmed at the prospect and there is a general hardening of attitudes towards such incursion. Your Spotlight report, \u2018I don\u2019t understand why they threw us on the street\u2019 (1 February) illustrated this dilemma, but also contained the seeds of its resolution. The Italian reception centre was closed down, but plenty of sympathetic Italian citizens were prepared to take in the migrants. Would it not be the sensible thing to admit any migrants who had received a commitment to such support, thereby providing a framework in which the citizens themselves would determine which migrants would be admitted? Sponsorship has always been a component of immigration programmes. All it requires is the expansion of this practice to all types of immigration, including refugees. This would also allay the fears of those who object to being compelled to support uninvited migrants, and would thereby reduce this source of opposition to immigration. Most people are not racist, but do fear the effects of uncontrolled immigration on their living standards. David Barker Bunbury, Western Australia Listen to all sides, and then make your decision Everyone is biased, even you, by Nic Fleming (25 January) is food for thought in these divisive times. Fleming quotes a neuroscientist who says that, alarmingly, \u201cSocial media seems to be amplifying existing divisions [read: biases] and probably making them worse.\u201d Added to the old alternatives liberal and conservative, yet parading under their respective banners, there is renewed emphasis on centrism, which is considered capable of also nurturing biases. All this brings to mind a clear-headed line of advice from Walt Whitman, that \u201cYou shall listen to all sides and filter them from yourself.\u201d Richard Orlando Westmount, Quebec, Canada How did the US make contact with Guaid\u00f3? A weakness of the article by Julian Borger about US support for Venezuela\u2019s self-declared president Juan Guaid\u00f3 (1 February) is that it neither says which measures the US took to establish communications with Guaid\u00f3, nor that one couldn\u2019t find these out. It is difficult to believe such contacts did not take place. Christopher Mail\u00e4nder Gschwend, Germany Doing the same thing and expecting different result Susie Orbach quotes the Brexit slogan \u201cTell them again!\u201d (1 February). A more sophisticated version of this is to cite a second referendum as conforming to Einstein\u2019s definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and expecting a different result. This assumes that voters have the reasoning capacity of a lump of magnesium.

      "body": "<p>Electric cars are already cheaper to own and run than petrol or diesel alternatives in five European countries analysed in new research.</p> <p>The study examined the purchase, fuel and tax costs of Europe\u2019s bestselling car, the VW golf, in its battery electric, hybrid, petrol and diesel versions. Over four years, the pure electric version was the cheapest in all places \u2013 UK, Germany, France, Netherlands and Norway \u2013 owing to a combination of lower taxes, fuel costs and subsidies on the purchase price.</p> <p>Researchers from the <a href=\"https://www.theicct.org/publications/using-vehicle-taxation-policy-lower-transport-emissions\">International Council for Clean Transportation (ICCT) said their report</a> showed that tax breaks are a key way to drive the rollout of electric vehicles and tackle climate change and air pollution.</p> <p>Carbon emissions from transport are a big contributor to global warming, but have been rising in recent years in the European Union. Vehicles are also a source of much air pollution, which causes 500,000 early deaths a year in the EU.</p> <p>Electric cars offer the biggest savings over diesel in Norway (27%) as the battery-powered vehicles are exempt from a heavy registration tax. The ICCT analysis was updated for the Guardian after recent cuts in the UK\u2019s grants for electric car purchases. It shows British drivers see the smallest saving \u2013 5%.

      "bodyText": "Electric cars are already cheaper to own and run than petrol or diesel alternatives in five European countries analysed in new research. The study examined the purchase, fuel and tax costs of Europe\u2019s bestselling car, the VW golf, in its battery electric, hybrid, petrol and diesel versions. Over four years, the pure electric version was the cheapest in all places \u2013 UK, Germany, France, Netherlands and Norway \u2013 owing to a combination of lower taxes, fuel costs and subsidies on the purchase price. Researchers from the International Council for Clean Transportation (ICCT) said their report showed that tax breaks are a key way to drive the rollout of electric vehicles and tackle climate change and air pollution. Carbon emissions from transport are a big contributor to global warming, but have been rising in recent years in the European Union. Vehicles are also a source of much air pollution, which causes 500,000 early deaths a year in the EU. Electric cars offer the biggest savings over diesel in Norway (27%) as the battery-powered vehicles are exempt from a heavy registration tax. The ICCT analysis was updated for the Guardian after recent cuts in the UK\u2019s grants for electric car purchases. It shows British drivers see the smallest saving \u2013 5%. In Germany, France and the Netherlands, the saving varied from 11% to 15%. Sandra Wappelhorst, from the ICCT, said: \u201cMost trips are within an electric vehicle\u2019s range, and it is the battery electric vehicle that turns out to be the most cost effective over four years.

After being damaged during Storm Desmond in December 2015, its interior has been rebuilt and is now a bright open-plan space that tells the story of Keswick\u2019s pencil industry from its origins in the 1550s. That\u2019s when Borrowdale shepherds are said to have discovered that the black substance clinging to the base of an upturned tree was really useful for marking their sheep. The mineral was graphite, known locally as \u201cwad\u201d. In the 17th century some saw it as more valuable than gold, which led to a thriving black market, centred on a Keswick pub. Fun fact During the second world war Keswick pencil-makers were commissioned by MI6\u2019s Charles Fraser-Smith \u2013 the real-life Q \u2013 to design and make a secret pencil to help British airmen evade capture. The ordinary-looking pencils concealed miniature brass compasses and tightly rolled tissue-paper maps showing escape routes out of Germany. Best thing about it As centrepieces go, it\u2019s not quite as \u201cwow\u201d as the Natural History Museum\u2019s Blue Whale skeleton, but the 7.91-metre colouring pencil made at the Derwent Pencil Factory (which relocated from Keswick to nearby Workington in 2008) dominates the museum hall like a psychedelic missile.

We winced after entering through a fibreglass Borrowdale mining tunnel to discover just one room full of display boards, a few video screens and some vintage machinery (there\u2019s also a gallery space that hosts exhibitions and community art groups).

The red carpet portion of the show is broadcast live by the E! network.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who decides on the Oscars?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Oscars are voted for by members of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (aka Ampas), which currently numbers just under 8,000 voting members, divided into 17 separate branches, including actors, directors, costume designers, etc. (To join, names have to be proposed and approved by individual branches.) The Academy has received considerable criticism in recent years for the perceived white/male/elderly bias of its voters \u2013 and a drive to create a more diverse membership was instituted after the #OscarsSoWhite campaign in 2016.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many Oscars are there and how does a film get nominated?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There are 24 categories \u2013 ranging from best picture to best sound mixing \u2013 presented on Oscar night. The Academy also gives out a bunch of Scientific and Technical awards: this year, for example, it will honour the people behind Adobe Photoshop and the Medusa Performance Capture System. Also there are the honorary Oscars: this year they are going to actor Cicely Tyson, producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, Steven Spielberg's PR flack Marvin Levy and composer Lalo Schifrin (of Mission: Impossible renown).</p>\n    <p>Each of the main awards has its own rules and regulations for slimming down all the eligible entries \u2013 first to a longlist, then a shortlist, then the final nomination list. In most categories, to be eligible a film must have been released for seven days in Los Angeles before 31 December, and a specialist committee makes the selection for the nomination \u2013 which is then voted on by the full membership. For the best foreign language film award, each country can submit one film (89 were put forward this year), before a committee boils them down to a final five.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do Oscar winners win?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Oscar statuette isn't solid gold:&nbsp;it's gold-plated bronze on a black metal base. It is 34 cm tall and weighs 3.8 kg. While the Academy doesn't own it once it is handed over, its acceptance is conditional that recipients won't sell them unless they have offered them back to the Academy for $1.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The announcement triggered a wave of negative reaction, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ManohlaDargis/status/1095103651217985538\">New York Times critic Manohla Dargis calling it</a> \u201cinsulting and wrong\u201d and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BilgeEbiri/status/1095093424439640066\">former Village Voice critic Bilge Ebiri writing</a>: \u201cI am fucking furious \u2026 what a stupid decision.\u201d Both pointed out that Bailey made his name in the industry as a cinematographer, with credits including American Gigolo, Ordinary People and Groundhog Day.</p> \n<p>The announcement comes as the Academy has continued to run into problems while seeking ways to stem the ratings decline for its flagship Oscar broadcast, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/06/oscars-2019-problems-mount-as-academy-aims-to-reboot-tv-show\">host network ABC demanded changes</a> in the wake of record low figures for the 2018 edition. <a href=\"https://content.guardianapis.com/atom/guide/470f63a2-b378-46cc-bf93-4146926166b0\">Original host Kevin Hart dropped out</a>, and a proposal for a \u201cbest popular film\u201d category was dropped after widespread ridicule.

The French government, Renault\u2019s biggest shareholder, wants him to lead the Nissan board. However, Nissan\u2019s management is is waiting for an assessment by an internal governance committee created in December.</p> <p>Christian Stadler, a professor of strategic management at Warwick Business School, said: \u201cThe departure of Carlos Ghosn, who was such a talismanic figure for Nissan, is likely to have a bigger effect during the year ahead, as the company attempts to address the distribution of power in its relationship with Renault. At the moment, Nissan is by far the bigger player in terms of sales.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Japanese carmaker Nissan has cut its full-year profit forecast and taken a 9.2bn yen (\u00a365m) charge related to the scandal around its former chairman Carlos Ghosn, who was arrested over allegations of financial misconduct and breach of trust. Nissan said it had booked the charge to cover additional expenses linked to payments to Ghosn, in its first results since his arrest in November for allegedly under-reporting his pay by about 5bn yen between 2011 and 2015. The carmaker lowered its 2018 forecast to an operating profit of 450bn yen, down from 540bn yen, after weaker global car sales. It now expects revenues of 11.6tn yen, rather than 12tn yen. Nissan said it revised its full-year forecasts \u201cgiven the performance in the first nine months of the year\u201d, when its share of the global car market slipped 0.1 percentage point to 5.9%. The carmaker sold 4.02m vehicles over the period, down 2.1%, with growth in Japan, China and other markets offset by declines in North America and Europe. Nissan did better in the three months to December, its third quarter, when operating profits rose 25% to 103.3bn yen. It expects to sell 5.6m vehicles over the year. Ghosn, regarded as one of the titans of the global car industry until his fall from grace, rescued Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy two decades ago and forged a three-way alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi, which has come under pressure since the scandal erupted. He was sacked by Nissan and resigned from Renault, where he was chairman and chief executive, three weeks ago, and is awaiting trial in Japan. He strongly denies any wrongdoing. Although Renault and Nissan have vowed to keep their alliance, the scandal has heightened tensions between the French carmaker and its partners in Japan. Shortly before his arrest, Nissan executives were said to be unhappy about Ghosn\u2019s plans to strengthen the company\u2019s ties with Renault. Renault\u2019s chairman, Jean-Dominique Senard, will meet Nissan\u2019s chief executive, Hiroto Saikawa, at the latter carmaker\u2019s headquarters in Yokohama at the end of this week, in a second meeting aimed at restoring trust between the two companies. There are tensions over Senard\u2019s future position at Nissan. The French government, Renault\u2019s biggest shareholder, wants him to lead the Nissan board. However, Nissan\u2019s management is is waiting for an assessment by an internal governance committee created in December. Christian Stadler, a professor of strategic management at Warwick Business School, said: \u201cThe departure of Carlos Ghosn, who was such a talismanic figure for Nissan, is likely to have a bigger effect during the year ahead, as the company attempts to address the distribution of power in its relationship with Renault. At the moment, Nissan is by far the bigger player in terms of sales.\u201d",

But the big tests are coming. There were plenty of doubters last summer, including PSG\u2019s manager, Thomas Tuchel, who was not behind Buffon\u2019s recruitment.

He knew Buffon came with the expectation of playing regularly. The younger goalkeeper already had irritating experience of rotation, having spent much of the 2016-17 season swapping with Kevin Trapp before establishing himself last season as PSG\u2019s undisputed No 1. Having been at PSG since the age of 13 and honed his skills during successful loan spells at Lens, Bastia and Villarreal, Areola had arrived where he wanted to be.</p> \n<p>All that remained was for him to become No 1 for his country as well. In 2013 he was a teammate of Paul Pogba when France won the Under\u201120 World Cup \u2013 with Areola saving two penalties in the final\u2019s shootout \u2013 and last summer he got a senior World Cup medal as back-up to Hugo Lloris. He had good reason to be confident of becoming their first-choice goalkeeper, and not just because of Lloris\u2019s obvious decline.

This is a situation that must be respected and capitalised on. We must be proud to have players of this nature.

Goalkeeping duties have been split equally between the pair, with both playing exactly the same number of domestic and European matches this season. Areola appears to have come round to seeing his job-share with Buffon as the final stage of his development: rather than leave, he signed a new five-year contract in December even though Buffon\u2019s deal, which expires at the end of this season, is expected to be extended for another year. Eager to put on a united front, PSG arranged for them to answer questions together last week. \u201cHaving Gigi alongside me is nothing but beneficial,\u201d said Areola of the competitor he now describes as a \u201cbig brother\u201d. \u201cI can make my career last several extra years if I work to the maximum and that is what I try to do with him by my side. He is humble and doesn\u2019t look down on me. I\u2019m always happy to come to training with him.\u201d</p> \n<p>Buffon elaborated. \u201cI would like to share a little of my experience with him so that he knows how to handle certain situations in matches and beyond. He is good, sometimes very good, and I would like him to become even better. I hope to give him that.\u201d</p> \n<p>That hints at the lingering flaw in Areola\u2019s game \u2013 a propensity to make mistakes out of nowhere. His lapses are far less frequent than two years ago, when his errors were the chief reason why the less talented Trapp got so much game time, but they have not been eradicated. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r presumably saw that when he watched PSG at Lyon this month. Areola made several superb saves \u2013 including two with his feet, an aspect of goalkeeping in which perhaps only Manchester United\u2019s David de Gea is better \u2013 but he was at fault for Lyon\u2019s first goal, getting lost under a cross as Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 outjumped him.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"927cd8109329760009e2ff2f69dd3a17dcad83b5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/927cd8109329760009e2ff2f69dd3a17dcad83b5/103_47_3091_1855/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gianluigi Buffon (right) shares a joke with Alphonse Areola before last Saturday\u2019s win against Bordeaux.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gianluigi Buffon (right) shares a joke with Alphonse Areola before last Saturday\u2019s win against Bordeaux.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If Areola plays in the second leg it will be his first Champions League appearance since October. Buffon has played PSG\u2019s last three matches in the competition, Areola given the first three partly because the Italian was suspended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/11/real-madrid-juventus-champions-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">following his sending off after Juventus\u2019s quarter-final defeat by Real Madrid</a> last season.</p> \n<p>It took a while for Buffon to digest that loss, brought about by a last-gasp penalty awarded by Michael Oliver. \u201cIn the place of a heart he has a rubbish bin,\u201d the Italian railed immediately after that game, almost suggesting he thought the referee should have been more lenient because it quashed Buffon\u2019s last chance of winning the Champions League. Or so it seemed at the time. Now Buffon returns to Old Trafford, where he lost to Milan in the 2003 final, the first of his three falls at the last hurdle.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>While his comments after the Real match, for which he later apologised, are well remembered, an opinion he expressed just before that game seems more pertinent now.

Areola made several superb saves \u2013 including two with his feet, an aspect of goalkeeping in which perhaps only Manchester United\u2019s David de Gea is better \u2013 but he was at fault for Lyon\u2019s first goal, getting lost under a cross as Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 outjumped him. If Areola plays in the second leg it will be his first Champions League appearance since October. Buffon has played PSG\u2019s last three matches in the competition, Areola given the first three partly because the Italian was suspended following his sending off after Juventus\u2019s quarter-final defeat by Real Madrid last season. It took a while for Buffon to digest that loss, brought about by a last-gasp penalty awarded by Michael Oliver. \u201cIn the place of a heart he has a rubbish bin,\u201d the Italian railed immediately after that game, almost suggesting he thought the referee should have been more lenient because it quashed Buffon\u2019s last chance of winning the Champions League. Or so it seemed at the time. Now Buffon returns to Old Trafford, where he lost to Milan in the 2003 final, the first of his three falls at the last hurdle. While his comments after the Real match, for which he later apologised, are well remembered, an opinion he expressed just before that game seems more pertinent now. When asked to name the goalkeepers he considered to be in line to succeed him as the best in the world, he answered: \u201cNot taking account of Italian keepers, I would say Jan Oblak, Keylor Navas, Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen, Ederson, Manuel Neuer and Thibaut Courtois. I hope I did not forget anyone.\u201d David de Gea and Areola must have slipped his mind but now they, like him, will have a big say in whether Buffon gets yet another chance to lift the European Cup.",

      "bodyText": "The El Chaparral crossing from Tijuana, Mexico, into the US is the crossroads of the world. Sisters from El Salvador plait one another\u2019s hair; men from Cameroon await an asylum hearing on the far side. Iranians play dice; a father from Brazil buys his child a taco from a street stand with carefully counted coins. Groups of young Americans also converge carrying armfuls of papers. They are also migrants of a sort: they have come from all over the US to volunteer for a remarkable organisation called Al Otro Lado \u2013 To the Other Side. As the Trump administration turns the screw on migrants \u2013 refusing to accommodate those awaiting asylum interviews as law requires \u2013 these people, their counsel and sustenance to those in flight and need, are a counterforce against cruelty. Nicole Ramos, the director of the group\u2019s border rights project, defines Al Otro Lado\u2019s job as \u201cwork that never ends\u201d. And the principle of that work is \u201cto get the courts and federal law enforcement to follow federal law. To stop the people whose role is to uphold the law from routinely breaking it.\u201d Ramos exudes tireless, effervescent purpose. She wears a ring made of bullet casing, with the round made of obsidian. \u201cI came here to apply what I knew about the broken system,\u201d she says. Ramos arrived in Tijuana to volunteer at its migrant shelter, but became outraged by the difficulties asylum seekers faced in presenting themselves to US authorities. She teamed up with two immigration attorneys working in southern California: Nora Phillips and Erika Pinheiro, who founded Al Otro Lado in 2011. \u201cIn the last month, we\u2019ve counselled over 2,000 migrants. This is the new normal,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are going to keep coming. We are barely stemming the tide, and so many people are hurting so much\u201d. The first step for an asylum-seeker is to present themselves at a port of entry like this one, and wait in detention by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) for a \u201ccredible fear interview\u201d, after which one may or may not get a court hearing. After sending refugee Jews back to die in Nazi Germany, the US signed the 1939 Montevideo Treaty on asylum, under which any foreign national appearing at the border and expressing fear of violence at home must be granted an interview with an asylum officer. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has no statutory authority to the contrary, but refugees are now kept waiting for weeks or months. In December the new Mexican government of \u00c1ndres Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador accepted Trump\u2019s new \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d policy, under which asylum seekers are sent back to Mexico after their interview, until scheduled to appear before a judge \u2013 a process that can take up to four years. Last week, the US unilaterally returned a number of asylum seekers through the San Ysidro crossing. As they did so, two shocking episodes brought Al Otro Lado\u2019s work into disturbing limelight. On 29 January Pinherio, an American citizen, was stopped crossing into Tijuana, inexplicably detained two hours and returned to the US. Papers proving that her infant son was Mexican were of no consequence. Two days later, Phillips was detained while travelling with her family into Guadalajara airport; she was held seven hours with her daughter, denied water and medicines, and deported back to the US. It remains unclear which government blacklisted their passports. \u201cI think this is retaliation,\u201d said Phillips, \u201cI think it\u2019s that we\u2019re pointing out gross, flagrant human rights violations being committed by the US government, and they don\u2019t like that.\u201d Al Otro Lado works on both sides of the border, representing both detained and non-detained immigrants in US court proceedings and educating migrants of their rights under US law. There\u2019s no attempt to feed migrants\u2019 dreams or delusions, said Ramos: \u201cWe\u2019d be violating our own ethos if we didn\u2019t warn people and explain the grim realities of detention. I tell them: \u2018The US government will try to break you, and you have to be stronger than them.\u2019\u201d Al Otro Lado\u2019s Tijuana premises occupy three storeys of Enclave Caracol, a food co-op and free vegan cafe, bike workshop and music venue. Outside is charismatic, scary Tijuana; the second largest city on the Americas\u2019 Pacific coast after Los Angeles and Mexico\u2019s homicide capital. But as lunchtime approaches, Al Otro Lado\u2019s main space doubles up as a free canteen, then seminar room for \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d sessions \u2013 Spanish for some three-score people, plus English and French/Haitian Creole for smaller groups upstairs. Two legal assistants running these sessions were themselves deported. Pricila Rivas was \u201cseparated from my parents after living all my life in the USA, deported to a place I didn\u2019t know, where not even knowing Spanish makes me Mexican\u201d; and Rigo Mart\u00ednez, deported \u201cby myself, 10 years ago from California, where all my family lives\u201d. It helps, says Pricila, \u201cthat we went through what [the migrants] are going through, the other way round. It was so scary being deported without the information we needed.\u201d Finally, Ramos finds time to feed herself, and we adjourn to a taqueria next door. The US authorities \u201cdespise us for informing people\u201d, she says. \u201cWe tell migrants that once they get to the port of entry, everything that happens is potential ground for litigation, and the authorities don\u2019t like people knowing their rights. \u201cPeople on the other side say we\u2019re fake lawyers, troublemakers. They call us radicals. Well, if following the law is radical, let me be radical.\u201d Into the office comes Jess Fuller, responsible for technology and administrative support, with a laptop containing details of 1,400 migrant consultations she has processed over two months. \u201cSo many people come in,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s easy for their cases to fall through the cracks.\u201d In an interview before she was turned back from Mexico on 29 January, Pinheiro warned that the Trump administration\u2019s policies are exposing asylum seekers to very real dangers: \u201cWe\u2019ve had so many disappearances, reports of people who\u2019ve either been disappeared by organised crime or forced to work for them.\u201d \u201cGangs and death squads follow them,\u201d adds Ramos, \u201cchasing them through Mexico, or through affiliated gangs here.\u201d Pinheiro, the daughter of Portuguese immigrants, is a specialist in child and immigrant detention in Los Angeles. \u201cI\u2019ve worked many years in detention facilities in the US \u2013 immigrant detention for adults and kids, county jails in LA \u2013 and it\u2019s been very hard.

      "body": "<p>When it comes to Twitter, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress last November, beats every other US politician hands, nose and elbows down. She has built one of the most engaged followings on Capitol Hill in just eight months and was even appointed to teach social media lessons to her colleagues upon her arrival.</p> <p>How does she do it? I spend my days analyzing data for the Guardian and helping run our social media accounts, so I\u2019m used to digging into numbers and figuring out what gets people going. And more often than not, it\u2019s the less obvious things that reveal what\u2019s really happening.</p> <p>Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Twitter account (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@AOC</a>) has more than 3.1 million followers. It has gained more than 2.6 million of these in the last eight months. Before she won her primary in June, beating a powerful 10-term Democratic incumbent, she only had 446,000 followers. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2019-02-11T17:19:45/embed.html\" data-alt=\"How Ocasio-Cortez's number of Twitter followers has grown since June 2018\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2019-02-11T17:19:45/embed.html\">How Ocasio-Cortez's number of Twitter followers has grown since June 2018</a> </figure>  <p>Ocasio-Cortez also has more than 2.1 million followers on Instagram and 500,000 on Facebook, but Twitter is where she really dominates the conversation.</p> <p>She already has more Twitter followers than the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi (2.2 million), and she only just trails Joe Biden (3.3 million). </p> <p>She may have far fewer followers than Trump (58.2 million), but if you look at her interaction rate, which averages out overall interactions per tweet against the account\u2019s number of followers, it\u2019s 2.8% for the last three months.</p> <p>That may not sound like much, but to put it in perspective, Donald Trump\u2019s is 0.2%. Barack Obama\u2019s is 0.4%. Hillary Clinton\u2019s is 0.2%. Bernie Sanders\u2019 is 0.09%.</p> <p>Even when you look at pure, non-weighted engagement, Ocasio-Cortez still punches well above her weight. For example, Trump has 21 times more followers than her. Yet he generated only 2.5 times as many total interactions as she did in January (43.2m compared to 17.5m).</p> <p>All these numbers are useful for understanding the scale of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Twitter popularity, but do little in terms of explaining it. To further understand why they\u2019ve done so well, here\u2019s a brief timeline of her rapid ascent, and the tweets that have defined it:</p> <h2><strong>She doesn\u2019t let critics shape her narrative (June 2018)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1012816020476743680\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Some folks are saying I won for \u201cdemographic\u201d reasons.<br><br>1st of all, that\u2019s false.

But it was her primary win in June that first gave her a national platform, and this tweet (her biggest in June) set the tone for how she was going to operate.</p> <p>It quickly established that Ocasio-Cortez wasn\u2019t going to let her critics \u2013 whether Republicans or Democrats \u2013 shape her narrative. Her tweet is a two-part fact-check. But instead of using cold stats like fact-checks usually do, she provides photographic and anecdotal evidence that\u2019s much more personal and emotive.</p> <h2>She uses Fox News to her advantage (July 2018)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1013784599019782145\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pretty much! <a href=\"https://t.co/73nxk22W55\">pic.twitter.com/73nxk22W55</a></p>&mdash; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1013784599019782145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 2, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Whether they like it or not, the very fair and balanced people over at Fox News have played a considerable role in Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s success.

But it\u2019s her use of \u201cslaying lewks\u201d that douses her already fire tweet with the most flammable thing on the internet: relatability. She speaks the language of her young fans, and they\u2019ve probably never seen anything like it from a politician before.</p> <p>This is what really sets her apart in Congress. Most politicians are elected to represent normal people yet have to hire consultants for advice on how to speak to millennials. Remember when Hillary Clinton told people to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LtTpZpGE6c\">\u201cPok\u00e9mon Go to the polls\u201d</a>?</p> <p>It should also be noted that September was the month Ocasio-Cortez took her Fox-trolling to new heights:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1041386969962635264\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thank you Fox News for making all the campaign graphics I never knew I needed <a href=\"https://t.co/TtaWR0PsOZ\">pic.twitter.com/TtaWR0PsOZ</a></p>&mdash; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1041386969962635264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 16, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2><strong>She has a compelling backstory (October 2018)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1051170876136312833\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">At 22, I was working w/ children + communities.<br><br>At 25, I was waitressing to support my family.<br><br>At 28, I won my primary for Congress.

Her story of growing up in a working-class family and bartending a year before she won her primary has become a powerful part of her appeal.</p> <p>It\u2019s not the sole reason she\u2019s popular, but rather acts as a shield around her beliefs. Republicans have tried to dismantle this story as much as possible, and you can see why. After they\u2019ve spent decades trying to paint liberals as out-of-touch elites, it\u2019s one of the biggest threats to their entire narrative.</p> <h2><strong>She\u2019s fluent in emoji (November 2018)</strong></h2> <p>It may not sound like much to anyone who regularly uses emojis, but this is big for a member of Congress. Remember when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hillaryclinton/status/631538115514007553?lang=en\">Hillary asked people to sum up how people felt about student debt in three emojis?</a> And can you imagine someone like Beto O\u2019Rourke or Elizabeth Warren even using the cry-laughing one without it looking weird?

      "bodyText": "When it comes to Twitter, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress last November, beats every other US politician hands, nose and elbows down. She has built one of the most engaged followings on Capitol Hill in just eight months and was even appointed to teach social media lessons to her colleagues upon her arrival. How does she do it? I spend my days analyzing data for the Guardian and helping run our social media accounts, so I\u2019m used to digging into numbers and figuring out what gets people going. And more often than not, it\u2019s the less obvious things that reveal what\u2019s really happening. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Twitter account (@AOC) has more than 3.1 million followers. It has gained more than 2.6 million of these in the last eight months. Before she won her primary in June, beating a powerful 10-term Democratic incumbent, she only had 446,000 followers. Ocasio-Cortez also has more than 2.1 million followers on Instagram and 500,000 on Facebook, but Twitter is where she really dominates the conversation. She already has more Twitter followers than the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi (2.2 million), and she only just trails Joe Biden (3.3 million). She may have far fewer followers than Trump (58.2 million), but if you look at her interaction rate, which averages out overall interactions per tweet against the account\u2019s number of followers, it\u2019s 2.8% for the last three months. That may not sound like much, but to put it in perspective, Donald Trump\u2019s is 0.2%. Barack Obama\u2019s is 0.4%. Hillary Clinton\u2019s is 0.2%. Bernie Sanders\u2019 is 0.09%. Even when you look at pure, non-weighted engagement, Ocasio-Cortez still punches well above her weight. For example, Trump has 21 times more followers than her. Yet he generated only 2.5 times as many total interactions as she did in January (43.2m compared to 17.5m). All these numbers are useful for understanding the scale of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Twitter popularity, but do little in terms of explaining it. To further understand why they\u2019ve done so well, here\u2019s a brief timeline of her rapid ascent, and the tweets that have defined it: She doesn\u2019t let critics shape her narrative (June 2018) Ocasio-Cortez introduced herself to many voters with a campaign video in May that ended up going semi-viral. But it was her primary win in June that first gave her a national platform, and this tweet (her biggest in June) set the tone for how she was going to operate. It quickly established that Ocasio-Cortez wasn\u2019t going to let her critics \u2013 whether Republicans or Democrats \u2013 shape her narrative. Her tweet is a two-part fact-check. But instead of using cold stats like fact-checks usually do, she provides photographic and anecdotal evidence that\u2019s much more personal and emotive. She uses Fox News to her advantage (July 2018) Whether they like it or not, the very fair and balanced people over at Fox News have played a considerable role in Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s success. On top of the all the free airtime they\u2019ve given her, they\u2019ve also provided her with plenty of ammo. The above graphic in particular sparked a running joke that Ocasio-Cortez would use again: is the Fox News graphics department actually on her side? She calls Republicans out (August 2018) During a recent talk, the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates asked Ocasio-Cortez when she decides to \u201cdunk on fools\u201d. \u201cWhoever is coming at me in my mentions with a blue check when I haven\u2019t eaten in three hours,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd until more people start pitching in and holding people to account, I\u2019m just going to let them have it.\u201d The above tweet was one of the first big examples of her doing this, when she picked apart Ben Shapiro\u2019s strange and expensive debate challenge. She makes fact-checking fun (September 2018) This was Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s most popular tweet in September and, just like her biggest one in June, she\u2019s setting the record straight. Targeting the far right is always going to be a popular move on Twitter. But it\u2019s her use of \u201cslaying lewks\u201d that douses her already fire tweet with the most flammable thing on the internet: relatability. She speaks the language of her young fans, and they\u2019ve probably never seen anything like it from a politician before. This is what really sets her apart in Congress. Most politicians are elected to represent normal people yet have to hire consultants for advice on how to speak to millennials. Remember when Hillary Clinton told people to \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go to the polls\u201d? It should also be noted that September was the month Ocasio-Cortez took her Fox-trolling to new heights: She has a compelling backstory (October 2018) It\u2019s no surprise that, in an age where authenticity matters more than ever, Ocasio-Cortez has done so well. Her story of growing up in a working-class family and bartending a year before she won her primary has become a powerful part of her appeal. It\u2019s not the sole reason she\u2019s popular, but rather acts as a shield around her beliefs. Republicans have tried to dismantle this story as much as possible, and you can see why. After they\u2019ve spent decades trying to paint liberals as out-of-touch elites, it\u2019s one of the biggest threats to their entire narrative. She\u2019s fluent in emoji (November 2018) It may not sound like much to anyone who regularly uses emojis, but this is big for a member of Congress. Remember when Hillary asked people to sum up how people felt about student debt in three emojis? And can you imagine someone like Beto O\u2019Rourke or Elizabeth Warren even using the cry-laughing one without it looking weird? (Case in point: Warren attempted to speak internet last month, by asking the account WeRateDogs if her golden retriever was a \u201c15/10 official Good Boy\u201d.) There\u2019s no magic to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s use of our modern-day hieroglyphs, but what\u2019s notable is how you rarely notice them \u2013 they never jar or stand out. Like the rest of her language they have a natural flow, and help crystallize her air of authenticity. She\u2019s willing to criticize the establishment she\u2019s now part of (December 2018) This tweet was Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s biggest in December. In it, she contrasts her working-class background with her new job in Congress, and taps into people\u2019s huge frustrations with the healthcare system. Intentionally or not, it proves she\u2019s still one of us, and isn\u2019t going to give Congress a free pass now she\u2019s part of it. There\u2019s not much to dislike if you\u2019re a young, leftwing American who values authenticity and a willingness to hold power to account. She can dance and make a political point at the same time \u2013 January 2018 January was @AOC\u2019s biggest month so far, with the account adding a million new followers. A great deal of this momentum was generated by this one tweet, which got over 160k retweets and 787,000 likes. The video shows her dancing to Edwin Starr\u2019s song War (the one that goes \u201cwhat is it good for?\u201d). It was a tongue-in-cheek response after she was \u201couted\u201d for dancing in a spoof music video in college.

The account was later deleted, raising the possibility that it was planted by someone on the left who knew it would do wonders for her. Either way, it became the new focal point for the left\u2019s battle with the right over Ocasio-Cortez, and a huge news story. The idea that all Republicans were mocking her for dancing quickly took hold, despite limited examples of them doing so.

It helps that some key players are back fit, most notably Billy Vunipola and Manu Tuilagi, but there is one other key fresh ingredient. England are visibly enjoying their rugby again, which was not the case this time last year.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe highlighted before the game that we really wanted to enjoy the France game,\u201d said Youngs. \u201cWe were back at Twickenham, the squad\u2019s feeling good and we wanted to put on a show for a full house.

Over the ref\u2019s microphone on Sunday the buzzword \u2018Smash\u2019 was in constant use whenever France were in possession; line-speed is now an everyday requirement but England, with the tireless Tom Curry and Mark Wilson to the fore, are taking it to another level. Not only can it generate energy and momentum but, also, opportunity. Ireland turned over the ball 14 times against England; France did so 21 times. As a direct result England\u2019s transition game \u2013 the art of turning defence into attack \u2013 is coming on in leaps and bounds.</p> \n<p>John Mitchell and Scott Wisemantel, the two coaches recruited by Jones to re-boot England in this area, are proving valuable additions. Jones is still very much the chief selector but the balance of his team-sheet is now far better. So is the collective mindset. While controlled freedom might sound a tautology, it sums up the squad\u2019s less straitjacketed mood. Central to it all is Farrell, whose shift to No 10 has been another catalyst.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe bloke\u2019s a genius,\u201d said George, his Saracens teammate. \u201cI never see him have a bad game and that\u2019s why he\u2019s one of the best players in the world, if not the best player in the world.\u201d</p> \n<p>The net result is that England are starting to make good teams (in Ireland\u2019s case) look average and poor teams look abysmal.

      "bodyText": "The first rule of rugby gravity is simple. The best players and coaches are only as good as their next game, not the one just gone. The ideal time to judge this England team is not this week, with Wales up next in Cardiff, but after they have departed the dragon\u2019s lair. Everything in between is potential motivation to be pinned up in the home dressing-room. Occasionally, though, a side soars so high so rapidly it becomes impossible for friend and foe not to ponder how far up the rocket might ultimately go. It is more than 15 years since Twickenham shook to the roar of a crowd not merely relishing a successful team but one looking to redefine what Test rugby could and should be. If France\u2019s shortcomings played a big part on Sunday, England\u2019s power, pace and speed of thought in the first 50 minutes were on a different plane. It was barely 11 months ago that England finished fifth in the Six Nations championship with weighty questions hanging over the management. What has changed? The easy answer would be \u2018Everything\u2019 but that would be untrue. Jonny May, Owen Farrell, Elliot Daly, Courtney Lawes, Mako Vunipola and Jamie George all started in their side\u2019s 22-16 defeat by France in Paris a year ago, Farrell was captain and Eddie Jones was the man in charge of strategic affairs. The most obvious difference is in the players\u2019 body language: no longer are England treading through treacle but hurtling around the pitch at a speed many teams simply cannot match. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge advantage, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said their scrum-half, Ben Youngs, saluting May\u2019s sprinter\u2019s ability to unnerve casual back-field defenders. \u201cWhen you make a line break and teams are defending with 14 in the line, there is only one guy back. If you beat him it\u2019s just a straight foot race.\u201d It has also been a decent advert for their fitness and preparation methods; given Ireland also trained in Portugal last month without such eye-catching results, England\u2019s back-room staff deserve some recognition. It helps that some key players are back fit, most notably Billy Vunipola and Manu Tuilagi, but there is one other key fresh ingredient. England are visibly enjoying their rugby again, which was not the case this time last year. \u201cWe highlighted before the game that we really wanted to enjoy the France game,\u201d said Youngs. \u201cWe were back at Twickenham, the squad\u2019s feeling good and we wanted to put on a show for a full house. We enjoyed doing that. You can probably see it. From numbers one to 23, guys are thriving and loving being part of the team.\u201d Crucially, that zest is apparent with and without the ball. Over the ref\u2019s microphone on Sunday the buzzword \u2018Smash\u2019 was in constant use whenever France were in possession; line-speed is now an everyday requirement but England, with the tireless Tom Curry and Mark Wilson to the fore, are taking it to another level. Not only can it generate energy and momentum but, also, opportunity. Ireland turned over the ball 14 times against England; France did so 21 times. As a direct result England\u2019s transition game \u2013 the art of turning defence into attack \u2013 is coming on in leaps and bounds. John Mitchell and Scott Wisemantel, the two coaches recruited by Jones to re-boot England in this area, are proving valuable additions. Jones is still very much the chief selector but the balance of his team-sheet is now far better. So is the collective mindset. While controlled freedom might sound a tautology, it sums up the squad\u2019s less straitjacketed mood. Central to it all is Farrell, whose shift to No 10 has been another catalyst. \u201cThe bloke\u2019s a genius,\u201d said George, his Saracens teammate. \u201cI never see him have a bad game and that\u2019s why he\u2019s one of the best players in the world, if not the best player in the world.\u201d The net result is that England are starting to make good teams (in Ireland\u2019s case) look average and poor teams look abysmal. France were not so much beaten on Sunday as routed; Midi Olympique\u2019s blunt headline \u2018Waterloo\u2019 said it all. Whatever the generals are telling their troops appears to be going in one ear and out the other. Then again the rugby world was saying something similar after New Zealand ripped France 62-13 in Cardiff during the 2015 World Cup. That All Black side had an all-court game of rare slickness and intelligence, allied to forwards who could catch, pass and sprint as surely as their three-quarters. Collectively, they were playing a game beyond the reach of European sides, not simply Les Bleus. Which is why Jones has always wanted to pursue a third way. Simply battering teams will take a side only so far in the modern game; France had loads of muscle but little in the way of world-class dynamism. England, on the other hand, finally have a number of fit, hardcore ball-carriers, plus oodles of pace out wide and a world-class goalkicker. As Youngs put it: \u201cIf you\u2019re 30-8 up against France at half-time you are doing something right.\u201d It does not guarantee an England win in Cardiff on Saturday week but, suddenly, the 2019 World Cup no longer feels like mission impossible. R-E-S-P-E-C-T England\u2019s women also enjoyed a fine weekend, sweeping France aside 41-26 in front of a near sell-out crowd in Doncaster and a quarter of a million TV viewers. Hopefully, it will help generate further popularity and respect for the women\u2019s game and transform some of the sexist attitudes which, sadly, still exist.

      "bodyText": "In recent decades, the ruthless Casalesi clan of the Camorra mafia has earned billions of euros by burying more than 150,000 cubic metres of toxic waste in the countryside north of Naples. So last Thursday night, when 90 carabinieri paramilitary police officers surrounded several apartment buildings in Caserta, the provincial capital, many residents thought an anti-mafia blitz was under way. The targets were in fact immigrants, under scrutiny for sanitary inspections of their homes. It is part of a trend since Matteo Salvini of the far-right League became interior minister in June 2018. Senator Pietro Grasso, a member of the national anti-mafia commission and former prosecutor responsible for the 2006 arrest of the Sicilian mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano, said: \u201cUnfortunately, the Italian government [\u2026] is prioritising immigration, making people believe it is an emergency, rather than fighting the real problems, such as the mafia. Meanwhile, the bosses are getting richer and richer.\u201d On Sunday, Salvini announced the interior ministry would review spending on police protection for men and women under threat from the mafia, declaring \u201csome people have been under police escort for too long\u201d. In Catania, the eastern Sicilian stronghold of the powerful Santapaola clan, prosecutors are investigating NGO rescue boats, one of which was ordered to be seized in November after fears that discarded clothes worn by people arriving from Libya could have been contaminated with HIV. In Riace, part of Reggio Calabria, from where the feared \u2018Ndrangheta is thought to control much of Europe\u2019s cocaine trade, Mimmo Lucano, an anti-mafia mayor who revitalised his community by welcoming asylum seekers, has been under investigation since October on suspicion of aiding illegal immigration. Lucano has had repeated death threats from mafiosi, who also poisoned two of his dogs. In the past eight months, nearly 250 of Salvini\u2019s tweets have addressed immigration, compared with 60 about organised crime. Nicola Gratteri, one of Italy\u2019s most respected anti-mafia prosecutors, said: \u201cI\u2019ve heard him [Salvini] talking about immigration a lot. Haven\u2019t heard him talking about the mafia yet.\u201d When Salvini has tweeted about organised crime, for example the arrests in December of 90 people in Europe and South America accused of links to the \u2018Ndrangheta, it has often concerned investigations that began before his tenure. Arrivals to Italy have decreased by more than 80% since their peak. Thousands of police officers have conducted searches and inspections, and hundreds of people have been forcibly removed from welcome centres. Many of them are now homeless. The evictions followed the approval of the \u201cSalvini decree\u201d, which removed humanitarian protections for those not eligible for refugee status and suspended the asylum application process for individuals considered \u201csocially dangerous\u201d. Claudio Fava, the head of Sicily\u2019s anti-mafia commission, whose father was murdered by the mafia in 1984, said: \u201cThe new security decree is a mirror of Salvini\u2019s propaganda. \u201cThe law addresses almost exclusively immigration, but a security decree should also be concerned with the mafia, which is clearly not a priority for Salvini. The only element in the decree that mentions the mafia regards the seizure of property.\u201d The Salvini decree established that villas confiscated from mafiosi would be auctioned off publicly after a certain time. Experts have questioned this, citing the likelihood that properties could be purchased by citizens acting as stand-ins for mafia bosses. It feels as though the Italian mafias no longer make headlines, but others do. The interior ministry has carried out a ferocious campaign against what Salvini has described as a worse menace \u2013 the mysterious Nigerian mafia. In recent months, magistrates have arrested numerous individuals within the Nigerian community on suspicion of belonging to mafia clans. Many investigators point out the Nigerian clans are subordinate to the Italian mafias, but Salvini and his supporters have been swift in justifying anti-immigration policies in the face of what they describe as an \u201cinvasion\u201d of alleged African mafia bosses, which has risked aggravating racial prejudice. The linking of migrant communities and organised crime has echoes of the past in Italy. Between 1880 and 1915, 4 million Italians reached the US, a small minority of whom were tied to the mafia, the largest criminal organisation in the world. Mario Del Pero, a professor of international history at Sciences Po, said: \u201cThe anti-Italian prejudice, or rather \u2018Italophobia\u2019, was very strong in the United States.

Both leaders are looking to unite their respective bases and get them ready for the coming battle. Viewed through the prism of pure politics, that\u2019s the story of the last 48 hours in a nutshell. Morrison has certainly endured an acute parliamentary humiliation but his objective now will be to try to translate that into an electorally productive border protection war with Labor. Liberal party research indicates voters associate Morrison positively with \u201csuccess\u201d on stopping the boats, and that\u2019s a card the prime minister intends to play. Shorten had to pivot on the medical evacuation bill after Morrison successfully put the opposition in a corner, but the Labor leader\u2019s objective over the past 24 hours has been to emerge with the requisite parliamentary humiliation for Morrison, and also hold Labor\u2019s progressive supporters together, rather than cleave the base and create circumstances allowing the Greens to recover from their internal travails and position themselves on the moral high ground at Labor\u2019s expense. With the eyes of the country on the parliament, on 48 hours of grim, death-match politics, both leaders framed their own tests of character. Morrison\u2019s was the conventional Come to Daddy pitch. Shorten\u2019s was more nuanced. Morrison had sought to mow Shorten down at the National Press Club on Monday by deriding the Labor leader as a shifty exemplar of the dark arts of backroom politics \u2013 a politician who always looked to \u201csplit the difference\u201d rather than having stable convictions and sticking with them, come what may. Some in Labor thought that critique devastating. Perhaps taking that cue, Shorten sought to turn his alleged weakness into a strength by embarking on a practical demonstration of deal-making with a purpose. He set about building a parliamentary small \u2018c\u2019 coalition to get something done \u2013 a task the big \u2018C\u2019 Coalition has struggled to do during two choppy terms in government. Having done the deal, the Labor leader then told parliament if this was a character test, he was prepared to define precisely what that was. Shorten said extending an appropriate duty of care to people in offshore detention went to the core of the Australian character. \u201cIn fact this bill and our amendments are about Australia\u2019s character,\u201d Shorten told parliament, projecting calm in the high brinkmanship. \u201cIt\u2019s about how we treat sick people in our care.\u201d Shorten\u2019s decision to project some basic humanity in an election year is a risk. Of course it is, given how rancid this debate is in Australia. It is toxic. It shouldn\u2019t be risky. Basic morality makes it simple. A liberal democracy should not subject people who have committed no crime to a regime of indefinite detention. That regime has consequences. It is inflicting terrible harm on people, deliberately, as a matter of policy, to dissuade others from embarking on the same journey to Australia. Morrison talks a lot about the Coalition \u201cstopping the deaths at sea\u201d, the implication being institutional cruelty is the price you pay for that greater good.

Despite this extraordinary police effort \u2013 which cost \u20ac90m \u2013 neither the ballot boxes could be found nor the referendum prevented. Nevertheless, it left an open wound that will not heal for generations. On top of that, Spain unleashed a wave of repression and threat to our freedoms that continues today, to which the Catalan people have responded in the same way they did in October 2017: calmly, peacefully and democratically.

At the same time, it will highlight the fragility of Spanish democracy and the worrying politicisation of the justice system. The main hypothesis is a great fallacy: because the crime of rebellion demands the use of violence, and the violence was only used by the police force, the public prosecutor\u2019s office and the Vox party intend to convince the court that this violence was actually the direct responsibility of the government of Catalonia. This situation is nothing new: on 12 April 1963, a group of priests sent a public letter to Martin Luther King Jr criticising the Birmingham campaign, which fought for human rights and against segregation. On that same day, King was arrested on the charge of having violated the law against demonstrations. From prison he wrote a long letter in response \u2013 a paragraph from it serves to illustrate the situation in which all our persecuted and imprisoned colleagues find themselves:</p> <p>\u201cIn your statement you assert that our actions, even though peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate violence. But is this a logical assertion? Isn\u2019t this like condemning a robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn\u2019t this like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical inquires precipitated the act by the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock? Isn\u2019t this like condemning Jesus because his unique God-consciousness and never-ceasing devotion to God\u2019s will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion?

At the moment the trial is about to begin, it is essential to send a message to the democrats of the world who are concerned about this authoritarian leaning, and to the people of Catalonia in particular.</p> <p>Despite the repression, and despite the persistent refusal of Spain to take determined steps towards resolving the conflict, our position remains as resolute as it always has been: to uphold political dialogue, from a standpoint of acknowledgement and mutual respect, as the only way forward in relations between Catalonia and Spain, respectively free and respectively sovereign. Never under any circumstances has violence been an option for us, nor will it ever be \u2013 we have been victims of violence and we have suffered from it, but as far as we are concerned peace and non-violence are essential elements of Catalan society, a diverse and harmonious society that is the result of constant migratory processes of which we are the offspring.

A report by the charity Human Rights at Sea (HRAS) cited \u201cinconsistencies in reasoning\u201d given by Gibraltar and Panama for revoking the flag of Aquarius, which it said had acted transparently. The UK-based charity accused the flag states of putting commercial interests ahead of well-established obligations to save lives, and warned that it was \u201conly a small step\u201d for commercial vessels carrying out search and rescue operations to avoid taking those rescued to certain coastal states for political reasons. The report coincides with a warning on Monday from the Med\u2019s AlarmPhone network that 150 people, including pregnant women and children, were fleeing Libya in a boat with a broken-down engine. It follows claims by the two charities operating the Aquarius, which has been unable to sail in the Mediterranean without a flag, that Panama\u2019s maritime authority had bowed to \u201cblatant economic and political\u201d pressure from the Italian government to revoke its licence. \u201cWe cannot allow this incident of the deflagging of the Aquarius to be swept under the carpet,\u201d said David Hammond, the founder of HRAS. \u201cWhen there is established rule of law at sea that includes humanitarian actions to rescue people at sea, you can\u2019t play politics with that and you can\u2019t put commercial interests before saving lives.\u201d Hammond said he had written to the International Maritime Organization. \u201cWe have asked the IMO to look at the issue, to see whether or or not the deflagging of the Aquarius is the start of a precedent of removing the ability of search and rescue vessels to operate lawfully at sea to save lives.\u201d The IMO told the Guardian that while it audited member states to determine how well they carried out their duties as flag states, it had no mechanism to look into individual cases of deflagging.

More than 29,000 people are estimated to have been rescued by the ship, which has been the focus of a row over Europe\u2019s approach to migration since Italy refused to allow it to dock on its shores in June. Italy\u2019s anti-immigration interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has denied that his government was behind the decision to deflag the Aquarius. The HRAS said the deflagging had been political and went \u201cagainst the fundamental human rights principles evolved after the brutal excesses of the second world war, which was triggered by the then-failure to curb and challenge far-right political movements in Europe. \u201cThe drive for effective humanitarian policies and supporting actions in protecting individual rights is one of the core foundations at the heart of the European model, but at the time of writing and in the context of the central Mediterranean sea it is being eroded through appeasement, thereby undermining the established rule of law,\u201d the report said.

      "body": "<p>When the Hampstead and Kilburn MP Tulip Siddiq found out she was pregnant with her second child, which must have been roughly nine months and three weeks ago, \u201cI said to Chris, my husband: \u2018Thank God it\u2019s [due at] the end of January \u2013 that means I can vote.\u2019\u201d She is sitting in the living room of her new home in Kilburn, north-west London. It is homely, because there\u2019s a baby in it, but she and Chris have just moved in, and their only furniture is the gigantic plastic toy kitchen belonging to their two-year-old daughter, Azalea. Chris, she says \u201ctold me off, said that shouldn\u2019t be the first thing on my mind. But \u2026\u201d I\u2019m expecting her to say something a bit more predictable, about how obviously the baby comes first. Not so much \u2026 \u201cMy constituency is 75% remain. I don\u2019t know who the other 25% are because I\u2019ve never met them in my life. I have 22,000 EU nationals in my constituency; every single midwife and doctor I had at the Royal Free hospital, where I had this baby, was European. I can be doing a downward dog in a pilates class, and someone will ask me about their settled status. It\u2019s a really important vote for me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33c0fb8f96529d758eac47da363a28555eadd1bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33c0fb8f96529d758eac47da363a28555eadd1bf/18_17_1758_1055/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heavily pregnant Tulip Siddiq (bottom right) attends Parliament to vote in the crucial Brexit debate on 15th January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heavily pregnant Tulip Siddiq (bottom right) attends Parliament to vote in the Brexit debate on 15th January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the saying goes, if you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans. The vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal was to take place on Tuesday 15 January. Due to gestational diabetes, Siddiq was advised to have a caesarean section at 37 weeks \u2013 on the same day. Denied a proxy vote, she had two options: she could have been \u201cnodded through\u201d \u2013 a weird process in which two Labour whips and one Tory look at you, exchange glances with one another in mutual assurance that you are alive and of sound mind, and then you go home \u2013 but she still would have had to turn up at parliament. She could have \u201cpaired\u201d with an MP from an opposite party whose vote would have counteracted her own, but she discussed that in a cross-party new-mum-MP WhatsApp group. The Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson had her <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44867866\" title=\"\">pairing betrayed by Conservative MP Brandon Lewis</a> while she was on maternity leave in July. \u201cJo just said: \u2018I really wouldn\u2019t trust them. You don\u2019t understand how I felt, breastfeeding my newborn and seeing the pairing had been broken.\u2019\u201d The only way to guarantee her vote would be recorded was to be there in person. So she delayed her surgery.</p> <p>Seeing Siddiq arrive in a wheelchair caused public outrage \u2013 a reminder of how archaic our parliamentary system is that it wouldn\u2019t allow a woman who had been scheduled to have a baby a proxy vote. \u201cWhy,\u201d Siddiq asks, \u201cdo we expect women to change to suit arcane institutions? Why can\u2019t institutions change?\u201d The scene of her being wheeled into parliament by her husband, then taken into the lobby by Labour MP Clive Lewis (\u201cHe\u2019s an army man, he was shooing everyone out of the way\u201d) brought something human to the house \u2013 and not just from her own party. Tory MPs David Davis and Nicholas Soames offered solidarity \u2013 they expressed great regret at her predicament, and said it wasn\u2019t what they would wish for their own wives. Then came the prime minister. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/15/theresa-may-loses-brexit-deal-vote-by-majority-of-230\" title=\"\">She was about to lose the most important vote of her life</a>, and she came over and said: \u2018I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re in this position; I regret we couldn\u2019t offer you proxy voting.\u2019 As much as I think she has made policy that has ruined some women\u2019s lives, it was a very humane thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>The next day, she was granted a proxy vote, the first person in history to be allowed this. Not long after, a year-long trial to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/22/mps-on-parental-leave-to-be-allowed-proxy-vote\" title=\"\">allow MPs proxy votes</a> in the case of maternity leave, paternity leave or adoption was announced. Siddiq is stoic, and describes her medical interactions in a doughty, mischievous spirit, where people advise her to rest and there are just 17 things she has to do first. But haring into Westminster the day before a C-section was, plainly, very stressful. \u201cYou can\u2019t eat for a certain amount of time, they clean your stomach. I should really have been preparing for all that. Instead, what do I do? I\u2019m sitting in a cab, to go to parliament and have this surreal experience.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93b2546c4a58882235e2bc0c8e6e74625ff8e81f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93b2546c4a58882235e2bc0c8e6e74625ff8e81f/0_336_3888_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Siddiq speaks at a Women Against Brexit rally in central London, 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Siddiq speaks at a Women Against Brexit rally in central London, 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We have this conversation as her baby son, Raphael, lies on her, sleeping. The tableau brings out an intense protectiveness, not because he is so cute, or because she is 4ft 11in, but because he is three weeks old, and she is talking in this completely open, unguarded way and, never mind whether or not the concept of nappy brain is a misogynist conspiracy, it seems incredibly unfair to hold anyone to anything they say, three weeks after they have just had a child, let alone write it down. But she has a superb confidence, born, I think, partly because her constituency is in her bones. She has been a member of Hampstead and Kilburn Constituency Labour party since she was 15 (she is now 36). The seat was held by Glenda Jackson for 23 years, and when she stood for selection Siddiq was advised: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you change your name to Tulip Percy?\u201d \u2013 her husband\u2019s surname. \u201cThere was a real feeling from the outside that the Jewish community wasn\u2019t going to accept me,\u201d she says. A feeling that she knew was wrong, having canvassed with them since she was in her teens. When Jo Cox was murdered, \u201cIt was the rabbis who were the first to call me, to see how they could help. I actually do my advice surgeries at JW3 (a Jewish community centre) now, because they have their own security.\u201d As vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group against antisemitism, her line on the continuing row is: \u201cPeople who were problematic to begin with, 10 years ago, are still there and they still cause problems. It\u2019s the same cranks with renewed energy.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c812f18297a30841736d0471590f2b78566d79d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c812f18297a30841736d0471590f2b78566d79d9/0_15_4734_2840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prime minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina, Saddiq\u2019s aunt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prime minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina, Saddiq\u2019s aunt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Being a home-grown MP, she is much more open and less worried that she\u2019ll get it wrong than other (albeit talented) MPs who have been parachuted in. Siddiq resigned from the front bench when she refused to vote to trigger article 50. She wants a public vote, and, oh, God, the relief of hearing an MP who actually cares about EU nationals, even while she won\u2019t get any votes from them. \u201cI have realised that I have it a lot easier,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a staunch remainer and my constituency is staunch remain. It\u2019s very different for me than it is for Stephen Kinnock or Ed Miliband.\u201d</p> <p>Siddiq is from as near as dammit to a political dynasty, just not British politics. Her aunt, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sheikh-hasina\" title=\"\">Sheikh Hasina</a>, is the prime minister of Bangladesh; her grandfather, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was the country\u2019s first president, assassinated in 1975. That is not to say she was raised as a future leader. \u201cMy mother was quite discouraging, initially. She was traumatised by what had happened to her father.\u201d It does seem to have given her quite a Teflon attitude, which she has needed, since this connection is also the source of great controversy. Hasina has been repeatedly criticised by human rights groups internationally for claims of political disappearances, detentions without trial, threats by security forces associated with her regime, essentially the hallmarks of a police state. Siddiq, for her part, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/04/tulip-siddiq-bangladesh-disappeared-abducted-prime-minister\" title=\"\">has been called upon to intervene</a> (by writers in this newspaper), which led to a splenetic exchange with a Channel 4 producer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/29/channel-4-news-complains-to-labour-over-tulip-siddiqs-threat\" title=\"\">\u201cThanks, Daisy, for coming,\u201d she said to the pregnant Daisy Ayliffe</a>, after a reporter asked about Ahmad bin Quasem, a British-trained barrister detained in Bangladesh. \u201cHope you have a great birth because child labour is hard.\u201d She had to apologise. Now, she says, \u201cI was just trying to humanise the situation, because it had got very heated. It seemed like a good time to say, \u2018look, we\u2019re both human beings\u2019.\u201d I wondered what she would say when I ask about her aunt: would she deny the strength of her relationship with her? It would be difficult since Hasina came to her maiden speech in parliament. \u201cI\u2019m personally close to my aunt,\u201d she says. \u201cShe was the first to call when this baby was born. She loves the kids. She says I\u2019m like her own daughter.\u201d There is an inconsistency, she points out, that Kinnock (whose wife is the former Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt) never gets asked to intervene in Danish politics in the way that she has with Bangladeshi politics. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to be where she is by listening to your niece on national security issues,\u201d says Siddiq. \u201cThere are two words she\u2019d say to me: \u2018Fuck off.\u2019 People need to realise the limitations that I have, how far removed I am from it. When they ask me to intervene, it makes me look a lot more powerful than I am.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/04/tulip-siddiq-bangladesh-disappeared-abducted-prime-minister\">Why will Tulip Siddiq not speak out on Bangladesh\u2019s \u2018disappeared\u2019 innocents? | Michael Polak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is clearly a remainer, left-but-not-Corbyn-loyal group of MPs in the Labour party, and I would say Siddiq was in it. But one of the lesser-remarked consequences of the current mess is that only the very obvious cliques and outriders are visible \u2013 you can\u2019t really see new political talent coming together. It is hard to say how organised they are \u2013 do they even have a WhatsApp group? \u201cNot for left-remainers.

      "bodyText": "When the Hampstead and Kilburn MP Tulip Siddiq found out she was pregnant with her second child, which must have been roughly nine months and three weeks ago, \u201cI said to Chris, my husband: \u2018Thank God it\u2019s [due at] the end of January \u2013 that means I can vote.\u2019\u201d She is sitting in the living room of her new home in Kilburn, north-west London. It is homely, because there\u2019s a baby in it, but she and Chris have just moved in, and their only furniture is the gigantic plastic toy kitchen belonging to their two-year-old daughter, Azalea. Chris, she says \u201ctold me off, said that shouldn\u2019t be the first thing on my mind. But \u2026\u201d I\u2019m expecting her to say something a bit more predictable, about how obviously the baby comes first. Not so much \u2026 \u201cMy constituency is 75% remain. I don\u2019t know who the other 25% are because I\u2019ve never met them in my life. I have 22,000 EU nationals in my constituency; every single midwife and doctor I had at the Royal Free hospital, where I had this baby, was European. I can be doing a downward dog in a pilates class, and someone will ask me about their settled status. It\u2019s a really important vote for me.\u201d As the saying goes, if you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans. The vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal was to take place on Tuesday 15 January. Due to gestational diabetes, Siddiq was advised to have a caesarean section at 37 weeks \u2013 on the same day. Denied a proxy vote, she had two options: she could have been \u201cnodded through\u201d \u2013 a weird process in which two Labour whips and one Tory look at you, exchange glances with one another in mutual assurance that you are alive and of sound mind, and then you go home \u2013 but she still would have had to turn up at parliament. She could have \u201cpaired\u201d with an MP from an opposite party whose vote would have counteracted her own, but she discussed that in a cross-party new-mum-MP WhatsApp group. The Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson had her pairing betrayed by Conservative MP Brandon Lewis while she was on maternity leave in July. \u201cJo just said: \u2018I really wouldn\u2019t trust them. You don\u2019t understand how I felt, breastfeeding my newborn and seeing the pairing had been broken.\u2019\u201d The only way to guarantee her vote would be recorded was to be there in person. So she delayed her surgery. Seeing Siddiq arrive in a wheelchair caused public outrage \u2013 a reminder of how archaic our parliamentary system is that it wouldn\u2019t allow a woman who had been scheduled to have a baby a proxy vote. \u201cWhy,\u201d Siddiq asks, \u201cdo we expect women to change to suit arcane institutions? Why can\u2019t institutions change?\u201d The scene of her being wheeled into parliament by her husband, then taken into the lobby by Labour MP Clive Lewis (\u201cHe\u2019s an army man, he was shooing everyone out of the way\u201d) brought something human to the house \u2013 and not just from her own party. Tory MPs David Davis and Nicholas Soames offered solidarity \u2013 they expressed great regret at her predicament, and said it wasn\u2019t what they would wish for their own wives. Then came the prime minister. \u201cShe was about to lose the most important vote of her life, and she came over and said: \u2018I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re in this position; I regret we couldn\u2019t offer you proxy voting.\u2019 As much as I think she has made policy that has ruined some women\u2019s lives, it was a very humane thing to do.\u201d The next day, she was granted a proxy vote, the first person in history to be allowed this. Not long after, a year-long trial to allow MPs proxy votes in the case of maternity leave, paternity leave or adoption was announced. Siddiq is stoic, and describes her medical interactions in a doughty, mischievous spirit, where people advise her to rest and there are just 17 things she has to do first. But haring into Westminster the day before a C-section was, plainly, very stressful. \u201cYou can\u2019t eat for a certain amount of time, they clean your stomach. I should really have been preparing for all that. Instead, what do I do? I\u2019m sitting in a cab, to go to parliament and have this surreal experience.\u201d We have this conversation as her baby son, Raphael, lies on her, sleeping. The tableau brings out an intense protectiveness, not because he is so cute, or because she is 4ft 11in, but because he is three weeks old, and she is talking in this completely open, unguarded way and, never mind whether or not the concept of nappy brain is a misogynist conspiracy, it seems incredibly unfair to hold anyone to anything they say, three weeks after they have just had a child, let alone write it down. But she has a superb confidence, born, I think, partly because her constituency is in her bones. She has been a member of Hampstead and Kilburn Constituency Labour party since she was 15 (she is now 36). The seat was held by Glenda Jackson for 23 years, and when she stood for selection Siddiq was advised: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you change your name to Tulip Percy?\u201d \u2013 her husband\u2019s surname. \u201cThere was a real feeling from the outside that the Jewish community wasn\u2019t going to accept me,\u201d she says. A feeling that she knew was wrong, having canvassed with them since she was in her teens. When Jo Cox was murdered, \u201cIt was the rabbis who were the first to call me, to see how they could help. I actually do my advice surgeries at JW3 (a Jewish community centre) now, because they have their own security.\u201d As vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group against antisemitism, her line on the continuing row is: \u201cPeople who were problematic to begin with, 10 years ago, are still there and they still cause problems. It\u2019s the same cranks with renewed energy.\u201d Being a home-grown MP, she is much more open and less worried that she\u2019ll get it wrong than other (albeit talented) MPs who have been parachuted in. Siddiq resigned from the front bench when she refused to vote to trigger article 50. She wants a public vote, and, oh, God, the relief of hearing an MP who actually cares about EU nationals, even while she won\u2019t get any votes from them. \u201cI have realised that I have it a lot easier,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a staunch remainer and my constituency is staunch remain. It\u2019s very different for me than it is for Stephen Kinnock or Ed Miliband.\u201d Siddiq is from as near as dammit to a political dynasty, just not British politics. Her aunt, Sheikh Hasina, is the prime minister of Bangladesh; her grandfather, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was the country\u2019s first president, assassinated in 1975. That is not to say she was raised as a future leader. \u201cMy mother was quite discouraging, initially. She was traumatised by what had happened to her father.\u201d It does seem to have given her quite a Teflon attitude, which she has needed, since this connection is also the source of great controversy. Hasina has been repeatedly criticised by human rights groups internationally for claims of political disappearances, detentions without trial, threats by security forces associated with her regime, essentially the hallmarks of a police state. Siddiq, for her part, has been called upon to intervene (by writers in this newspaper), which led to a splenetic exchange with a Channel 4 producer. \u201cThanks, Daisy, for coming,\u201d she said to the pregnant Daisy Ayliffe, after a reporter asked about Ahmad bin Quasem, a British-trained barrister detained in Bangladesh. \u201cHope you have a great birth because child labour is hard.\u201d She had to apologise. Now, she says, \u201cI was just trying to humanise the situation, because it had got very heated. It seemed like a good time to say, \u2018look, we\u2019re both human beings\u2019.\u201d I wondered what she would say when I ask about her aunt: would she deny the strength of her relationship with her? It would be difficult since Hasina came to her maiden speech in parliament. \u201cI\u2019m personally close to my aunt,\u201d she says. \u201cShe was the first to call when this baby was born. She loves the kids. She says I\u2019m like her own daughter.\u201d There is an inconsistency, she points out, that Kinnock (whose wife is the former Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt) never gets asked to intervene in Danish politics in the way that she has with Bangladeshi politics. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to be where she is by listening to your niece on national security issues,\u201d says Siddiq. \u201cThere are two words she\u2019d say to me: \u2018Fuck off.\u2019 People need to realise the limitations that I have, how far removed I am from it. When they ask me to intervene, it makes me look a lot more powerful than I am.\u201d There is clearly a remainer, left-but-not-Corbyn-loyal group of MPs in the Labour party, and I would say Siddiq was in it. But one of the lesser-remarked consequences of the current mess is that only the very obvious cliques and outriders are visible \u2013 you can\u2019t really see new political talent coming together. It is hard to say how organised they are \u2013 do they even have a WhatsApp group? \u201cNot for left-remainers. But there\u2019s a Women\u2019s PLP group, a BAME one, there\u2019s the 2015 intake, and conversations about Brexit happen in those.\u201d Siddiq, for her part, is not taking maternity leave. She was doing casework when her baby was three days old: \u201cThat won\u2019t wait, I can\u2019t get a researcher to do it; and it\u2019s a privilege to be an MP, I don\u2019t resent that.\u201d (Arguably, she could get a researcher to do casework.

      "bodyText": "Anti-corruption bodies will gain new powers under changes to the government\u2019s encryption legislation but Labor will continue to push to improve protections against the creation of \u201csystemic weaknesses\u201d. On Tuesday the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, accused the Coalition of welching on a deal to support amendments consistent with a bipartisan security committee report and announced the opposition will push them in the Senate. Labor will also refer the Telecommunications (Assistance and Access) Act \u2013 which grants law enforcement powers to demand tech companies create backdoors in users\u2019 products \u2013 to another inquiry to assess its economic impact. The chair of parliament\u2019s joint intelligence and security committee, Liberal MP Andrew Hastie, announced that Labor and the Coalition had agreed that commonwealth and state anti-corruption bodies should gain the bill\u2019s key powers for law enforcement agencies to compel technical assistance to access electronic communications. The home affairs department had argued it is \u201cinconsistent\u201d for bodies such as the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption to have powers to intercept electronic messages but prevent them from obtaining technical assistance to read them. Labor passed the encryption legislation on the final parliamentary sitting day of 2018, withdrawing its amendments in the Senate because it feared failure to pass the bill before Christmas would allow the government to argue it had compromised national security. It extracted a concession from the government that it would facilitate consideration of the Labor amendments in the new year. The government leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, went further, promising to support \u201call amendments that are consistent\u201d with the joint parliamentary committee on intelligence and security report under a bipartisan deal reached in early December that almost collapsed hours before the end of the final parliamentary session. Dreyfus said that the government had \u201ctried to resile from that commitment\u201d and it was \u201cnot tenable\u201d to argue that the Coalition had faithfully implemented the committee\u2019s recommendations. \u201cNo reasonable person accepts that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, who made a public submission to the committee, doesn\u2019t accept it.\u201d Dreyfus said Labor wants to add an amendment so that technology companies cannot be compelled to do anything that would, or could, \u201ccompromise the security of the critical systems or result in the personal information of innocent third parties being left vulnerable to hackers\u201d. He added that \u201cas a matter of principle, Labor does not believe that the attorney general or a senior police officer should be given the power to compel an innocent person, unconnected to an investigation, to provide technical assistance to a government agency without a warrant\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Andrea Leadsom has urged Conservative MPs not to be \u201cpurist\u201d about the changes Theresa May hopes to secure for the Irish backstop arrangement, as she said the House of Commons must give the prime minister more time for negotiations. The comments are likely to spark concern among Tory Eurosceptics who have insisted the withdrawal agreement must be reopened and legally binding changes made to the backstop, though MPs differ over whether they would like it removed entirely and replaced or just given a time limit. May will give a statement to the Commons on Tuesday where she will hope to convince MPs to give her another fortnight\u2019s grace to keep pushing for changes to the backstop \u2013 despite the insistence of the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, overnight that it is Britain that must compromise. Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said MPs should \u201chold their nerve\u201d and give May time to seek the changes they required, a coded warning to some MPs who may have been seeking to amend the prime minister\u2019s motion later this week to force a new timetable for a fresh vote on the Brexit deal. May had previously vowed to Eurosceptics after a vote passed in parliament mandating her to find \u201calternative arrangements\u201d to the backstop that she understood that meant reopening the withdrawal agreement text \u2013 something the EU has insisted cannot be done. Leadsom sounded cooler about that prospect on Tuesday, speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, and hinted that a codicil may be an alternative. \u201cThe point is to ensure that the UK cannot be held in a backstop permanently. How it\u2019s achieved is not something to be purist about,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m wedded to delivering on what parliament has said it would support and that is some kind of unilateral means or alternative arrangements for the UK not to be held in the backstop permanently.\u201d Leadsom would not commit to a new vote on the Brexit deal being held by the end of February, or even before the next EU summit on 21 March, eight days before the UK is due to leave the EU. She said the meaningful vote would be brought back only when May had \u201cmet the terms of parliament\u2019s instructions two weeks ago that the backstop needed to be time-limited\u201d. May is expected to bring forward another amendable motion, similar to the motion tabled this week, on 27 February so MPs will have another opportunity for debate if no deal has been reached by then. \u201cHer message today is going to be that parliamentarians should hold their nerve,\u201d Leadsom said. \u201cWhat the prime minister wants is a bit more time to undertake what are now pretty crucial but delicate negotiations with the EU. The work is under way and the prime minister needs a bit more time.\u201d Yvette Cooper and Nick Boles, two senior backbenchers whose amendment against no deal failed to gain majority support last month, have not yet made a final decision about whether to table a reworked version or wait until 27 February, the Guardian understands. But they have been working on a revised version of their bill to extend article 50, which would then have to be tabled by mid-March to have a chance of being passed before exit day. Their amendment would set a final mid-March deadline for May to win a majority for her deal, obliging the government to make time for the bill if she has not secured parliament\u2019s support before then. Labour will table its own amendment this week seeking to put what the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, calls a \u201chard stop\u201d, on the government\u2019s negotiating time by enforcing a deadline by which May must bring a deal back to the Commons. At a dinner with the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, on Monday night, Barnier said he would listen to the UK\u2019s plans for alternative to the backstop but insisted there was no chance of reopening the agreement. \u201cI will listen to what the secretary of state has to tell us concerning the alternative arrangements which the UK would like,\u201d Barnier said before the dinner. \u201cBut it\u2019s not more than a concept today.\u201d Responding to his comments, Leadsom said it was clear the compromise needed to be from Brussels. \u201cIt would be an extraordinary outcome if the thing the backstop is seeking to avoid \u2013 a hard border in Northern Ireland \u2013 if the EU were so determined to be completely intransigent about it that they actually incur the very thing they are seeking to avoid by pushing the UK into a situation where we leave without a deal at the end of March,\u201d she said.",

Trump and congressional Democrats agreed on 25 January to temporarily fund the departments and negotiate a funding solution by 8 February. Talks most recently broke down on Sunday, reportedly over a disagreement about the maximum number of undocumented immigrants who might be detained at any one time. While most of the government departments involved in the shutdown are not tied to immigration policy, Trump\u2019s demand for funding for a border wall has put border security at the centre of the negotiations to keep the government open. The most recent shutdown \u2013 the longest in US history \u2013 began in mid-December, when Trump rejected a spending package approved by congressional Republicans and demanded $5.7bn to construct a wall on the US-Mexico border.

      "body": "<p>You must have once sat in a bar listening to an apparently informed companion. At first, they beguile you. Then the drink flows, tongues loosen, fingers wag and the evening degenerates. I have been on both sides of the table. I have wagged and been wagged at so often I know the danger signs. Nowhere are they more evident than in today\u2019s lectures on how liberals \u201cjust don\u2019t get it\u201d.</p> <p>Yael Tamir offers an upmarket version of contemporary cliches. She is more wine bar than saloon bar, although, as the glasses are downed, the distinction between the two blurs. Tamir is from the subgenre of former or self-declared liberals and leftists. She was an anti-war activist in the Israeli Peace Now movement and like Blue Labour in Britain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/22/the-road-to-somewhere-david-goodhart-populist-revolt-future-politics\" title=\"\">the <em>Prospect</em> founder David Goodhart</a> and a significant faction in the leftwing press, she speaks to liberals more in sorrow than anger. To begin with, at least. She believes nationalist movements can be exploited for social democratic aims and deliver economic patriotism and social responsibility rather than, say, attacks on foreigners and stagnation.</p> <p>Her case starts uncontroversially to anyone who has read the work of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Gellner\" title=\"\">Ernest Gellner,</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/30/life-beyond-boundaries-benedict-anderson-review\" title=\"\">Benedict Anderson</a> or, indeed, thought about nations and nationality without reference to academic work. I did not need to be told that all nations must define their boundaries or that national identity ties strangers together. It was not news that there is only so much diversity any society can take. And when Tamir tells us that from the 19th century the state created nationality as it \u201cbuilt schools, taught the national language and spread national culture\u201d, my first thought was: \u201cReally, have you only just noticed?\u201d</p> <p>The first sign that we may need to call her a cab comes when she slips uncritically into the language of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/21/steve-bannons-rightwing-europe-operation-undermined-by-election-laws\" title=\"\">Steve Bannon</a>. Before the election of Donald Trump and the Brexit vote, \u201cglobalists\u201d dominated politics. By \u201cglobalist\u201d, she does not mean the handful of bankers and executives who can move from excessively well-remunerated job to job but hundreds of millions of voters in the west who live in cities and have broadly liberal instincts. The casual misuse of language matters because it allows her to dismiss vast numbers as corporate elitists when in truth they are no more likely to fly to Davos than to the moon.</p> <p>They voted for parties that \u201cemptied the public sphere of ideological and motivational forces that could promote social solidarity and encourage the erection of mechanisms necessary to combat social alienation\u201d, she proclaims as she reflects a nostalgia for the lost communities of the rural and industrial west she never knew. Is this a fair description of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/25/labour-years-term-report\" title=\"\">Labour Britain from 1997 to 2010</a>, which I recall spent billions on combating social alienation by building everything from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/06/sure-start-children-worked-why-theresa-may-out-to-kill-it\" title=\"\">Sure Start centres</a> to a generous system of pensioner benefits? Tamir does not say. Although she is a professor at the University of Oxford\u2019s Blavatnik School of Government, she seems to feel no pressing obligation to provide anything resembling evidence.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The professor does not know that the British Labour party in 2016 was led by Jeremy Corbyn, a lifelong anti-European</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The vulnerable rightly feel \u201cthose who exploit cheap labour and natural resources overseas portray themselves as moral universalists\u201d, she continues, \u201cwhile those defending their jobs are portrayed as narrow-minded bigots\u201d. There is undoubted resentment that opposition to immigration is portrayed as racism when every country in the world has immigration controls, but who believes in a free for all apart from a handful of powerless commentators?</p> <p>Alas, there\u2019s no stopping her. \u201cNationalism waters our memories, interprets our dreams and does not allow us to shrink into solitude,\u201d she says as she sinks into a maudlin reverie. Do you want to hear Churchill\u2019s Battle of Britain speeches or Henry V on the eve on Agincourt? Yet again? She repeats them anyway. Do you want to know why Remain lost the Brexit referendum? Because the \u201cBritish Labour party, like many other progressive leaders around the world, was closer to the elites than to the people\u201d. The professor does not seem to know that the British Labour party in 2016 was led by Jeremy Corbyn, a lifelong anti-European, who has opposed his members\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/28/second-brexit-referendum-eu-peoples-vote\" title=\"\">demands for a second referendum</a> ever since.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/25/labour-years-term-report\">The Labour years: Could have done better</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a wider intellectual fault that goes beyond the work of one author. Too many regard today\u2019s crisis as an end rather than a beginning. Rather than fight, they accept. The majority of MPs in the British Labour and Tory parties know that Brexit is a national mistake. The patriotic course for all who love their country is to stop it. Instead of fighting, however, they stay silent and play along. The people have spoken, they say. We dare not argue back.</p> <p>Dissent and opposition become impossible in these circumstances. As does a clear understanding of the world. At one point, Tamir declares that \u201cliberalism is loneliness\u201d and leaves us \u201cbawling\u201d into a void. If this were the case, then in Brexit Britain, Trump\u2019s America and Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary we ought by now to see evidence that nationalism is rebuilding solidarity and ending isolation. Couples should be staying together. Communities should be flourishing. No such evidence exists. Of course it doesn\u2019t, but if you talk as if it does you will fail to hold reactionaries to account.</p> <p>A first step in imposing accountability is to insist on the honesty that the right of the Tory and left of the Labour party cannot manage. Leaving the EU, slashing immigration, allowing nationalism to \u201cwater our memories\u201d will hurt. Before throwing your punches, you must ask the public\u2019s permission to inflict the pain and specify who will suffer, whose services will be cut and whose futures blighted.</p> <p>I think it is fair to say that the losers will not include visiting professors at Oxford. They will be left free to lose themselves in their well-watered memories and leave others to cope with the hangover.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Why Nationalism</em> by Yael Tamir is published by Princeton University Press (\u00a320).

      "bodyText": "You must have once sat in a bar listening to an apparently informed companion. At first, they beguile you. Then the drink flows, tongues loosen, fingers wag and the evening degenerates. I have been on both sides of the table. I have wagged and been wagged at so often I know the danger signs. Nowhere are they more evident than in today\u2019s lectures on how liberals \u201cjust don\u2019t get it\u201d. Yael Tamir offers an upmarket version of contemporary cliches. She is more wine bar than saloon bar, although, as the glasses are downed, the distinction between the two blurs. Tamir is from the subgenre of former or self-declared liberals and leftists. She was an anti-war activist in the Israeli Peace Now movement and like Blue Labour in Britain, the Prospect founder David Goodhart and a significant faction in the leftwing press, she speaks to liberals more in sorrow than anger. To begin with, at least. She believes nationalist movements can be exploited for social democratic aims and deliver economic patriotism and social responsibility rather than, say, attacks on foreigners and stagnation. Her case starts uncontroversially to anyone who has read the work of Ernest Gellner, Benedict Anderson or, indeed, thought about nations and nationality without reference to academic work. I did not need to be told that all nations must define their boundaries or that national identity ties strangers together. It was not news that there is only so much diversity any society can take. And when Tamir tells us that from the 19th century the state created nationality as it \u201cbuilt schools, taught the national language and spread national culture\u201d, my first thought was: \u201cReally, have you only just noticed?\u201d The first sign that we may need to call her a cab comes when she slips uncritically into the language of Steve Bannon. Before the election of Donald Trump and the Brexit vote, \u201cglobalists\u201d dominated politics. By \u201cglobalist\u201d, she does not mean the handful of bankers and executives who can move from excessively well-remunerated job to job but hundreds of millions of voters in the west who live in cities and have broadly liberal instincts. The casual misuse of language matters because it allows her to dismiss vast numbers as corporate elitists when in truth they are no more likely to fly to Davos than to the moon. They voted for parties that \u201cemptied the public sphere of ideological and motivational forces that could promote social solidarity and encourage the erection of mechanisms necessary to combat social alienation\u201d, she proclaims as she reflects a nostalgia for the lost communities of the rural and industrial west she never knew. Is this a fair description of Labour Britain from 1997 to 2010, which I recall spent billions on combating social alienation by building everything from Sure Start centres to a generous system of pensioner benefits? Tamir does not say. Although she is a professor at the University of Oxford\u2019s Blavatnik School of Government, she seems to feel no pressing obligation to provide anything resembling evidence. The vulnerable rightly feel \u201cthose who exploit cheap labour and natural resources overseas portray themselves as moral universalists\u201d, she continues, \u201cwhile those defending their jobs are portrayed as narrow-minded bigots\u201d. There is undoubted resentment that opposition to immigration is portrayed as racism when every country in the world has immigration controls, but who believes in a free for all apart from a handful of powerless commentators? Alas, there\u2019s no stopping her. \u201cNationalism waters our memories, interprets our dreams and does not allow us to shrink into solitude,\u201d she says as she sinks into a maudlin reverie. Do you want to hear Churchill\u2019s Battle of Britain speeches or Henry V on the eve on Agincourt? Yet again? She repeats them anyway. Do you want to know why Remain lost the Brexit referendum? Because the \u201cBritish Labour party, like many other progressive leaders around the world, was closer to the elites than to the people\u201d. The professor does not seem to know that the British Labour party in 2016 was led by Jeremy Corbyn, a lifelong anti-European, who has opposed his members\u2019 demands for a second referendum ever since. There is a wider intellectual fault that goes beyond the work of one author. Too many regard today\u2019s crisis as an end rather than a beginning. Rather than fight, they accept. The majority of MPs in the British Labour and Tory parties know that Brexit is a national mistake. The patriotic course for all who love their country is to stop it. Instead of fighting, however, they stay silent and play along. The people have spoken, they say. We dare not argue back. Dissent and opposition become impossible in these circumstances. As does a clear understanding of the world. At one point, Tamir declares that \u201cliberalism is loneliness\u201d and leaves us \u201cbawling\u201d into a void. If this were the case, then in Brexit Britain, Trump\u2019s America and Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary we ought by now to see evidence that nationalism is rebuilding solidarity and ending isolation. Couples should be staying together. Communities should be flourishing. No such evidence exists. Of course it doesn\u2019t, but if you talk as if it does you will fail to hold reactionaries to account. A first step in imposing accountability is to insist on the honesty that the right of the Tory and left of the Labour party cannot manage. Leaving the EU, slashing immigration, allowing nationalism to \u201cwater our memories\u201d will hurt. Before throwing your punches, you must ask the public\u2019s permission to inflict the pain and specify who will suffer, whose services will be cut and whose futures blighted. I think it is fair to say that the losers will not include visiting professors at Oxford. They will be left free to lose themselves in their well-watered memories and leave others to cope with the hangover. \u2022 Why Nationalism by Yael Tamir is published by Princeton University Press (\u00a320).

I have lost count of the number of times I have begun meetings with what feels like a sermon on the Armageddon taking place in our countryside. I am always greeted with patient, patronising smiles from many of my fellow MEPs, before they go on to ignore the warnings and refuse to limit the use of pesticides in our fields.</p> <p>Some of the members of this committee are themselves farmers who have grown increasingly dependent on powerful and toxic pesticides. But others have taken the agribusiness shilling and believe that their role in policymaking is simply to support the corporations that sell these poisons.</p> <p>And this is the nub of the issue. What might accurately be dubbed insectageddon is being driven by the agrichemicals industry. This situation is compounded by compliant politicians and policymakers who fall prey to lobbying pressure and then refuse to implement science-driven policy to protect wildlife. This has meant that over the past five decades conventional farmers have forgotten the natural systems they once relied on to control pests. Non-organic agricultural systems are highly dependent on chemicals, so feeding a vicious circle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2eae600924fd792015e9feec243a1b12984cef65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eae600924fd792015e9feec243a1b12984cef65/0_334_6199_3720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farm tractor spraying insecticide on to green fields of English countryside\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018EU member states have been slow to implement policies that reduce pesticide use.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Barritt/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there is a legal route out of this \u2013 in Europe at least. Since 2009 the EU has adopted the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/pesticides/sustainable_use_pesticides_en\" title=\"\">sustainable use of pesticides directive</a>.

      "bodyText": "Most of us spend more time swatting away or avoiding wasps and moths than we do contemplating their importance to the web of life. But it is no exaggeration to say that the horrifying decline in the number of these creatures \u2013 the most widespread on Earth \u2013 is a barometer for the whole planet. The new global scientific review into the perilous condition of our insects reports that more than 40% of insect species are threatened with extinction while the mass of insects is declining by 2.5% a year. This catastrophic decline is a direct cause of the existential threat to other animals, insects being at the bottom of the chain and the primary food source. Since 1970, 60% of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles have been wiped out. The review identifies a key driver towards this mass extinction: habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture with its associated use of pesticides. Given this is a manmade disaster, surely we are capable of tackling and reversing it? As a member of the European parliament\u2019s agriculture committee, I regularly debate the use of pesticides in farming with my colleagues. I have lost count of the number of times I have begun meetings with what feels like a sermon on the Armageddon taking place in our countryside. I am always greeted with patient, patronising smiles from many of my fellow MEPs, before they go on to ignore the warnings and refuse to limit the use of pesticides in our fields. Some of the members of this committee are themselves farmers who have grown increasingly dependent on powerful and toxic pesticides. But others have taken the agribusiness shilling and believe that their role in policymaking is simply to support the corporations that sell these poisons. And this is the nub of the issue. What might accurately be dubbed insectageddon is being driven by the agrichemicals industry. This situation is compounded by compliant politicians and policymakers who fall prey to lobbying pressure and then refuse to implement science-driven policy to protect wildlife. This has meant that over the past five decades conventional farmers have forgotten the natural systems they once relied on to control pests. Non-organic agricultural systems are highly dependent on chemicals, so feeding a vicious circle. But there is a legal route out of this \u2013 in Europe at least. Since 2009 the EU has adopted the sustainable use of pesticides directive. This aims to reduce the risks and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment, while prioritising the use of alternative approaches or techniques such as non-chemical methods. However, because it is a directive rather than regulation it requires implementation in national law, and the vicious circle that has led to high levels of chemical dependency also operates at national level, meaning that member states have been slow to implement policies that reduce pesticide use. And the agrichemical industry is literally writing pesticide assessments that are then presented as the work of regulators. For example, a recent report exposed how EU regulators based a decision to relicense controversial glyphosate on an assessment plagiarised from industry reports. Around 50% of some chapters were actually a copy-and-paste job from papers Monsanto and other agrichemical corporates had written. Scientific knowledge has given us the ability to choose that only the creatures that we value can survive on our land. But only the science of ecology has the wisdom to look at the system as a whole and to realise that killing any aspect of it will undermine other interlinked species. So to ensure that some key crops such as wheat are not troubled by insect predators, we are wiping out the very insects that crops such as oilseed rape need to be pollinated and to produce their flowers and oil-rich fruits. Tearing apart the web of life damages us all. Only a farming system that views itself as part of this web has a long-term future, and only organic farming does that. Since I was a teenager, the Earth has lost half of all its wildlife. To avoid today\u2019s teenagers being left with no wildlife at all by the time they are my age, we need to act fast.

We saw 50,000 people arrive. We saw 8,000 children go into detention and it has taken us six years to clean up Labor\u2019s mess.</p> </blockquote> <p>Question:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Are you saying that\u2019s what will happen under Labor\u2019s bill?</p> </blockquote> <p>Dutton:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe we will see boats. I think there is no question that people smugglers will be hearing very clearly that the policy in Australia has changed and I think we need to be very cognisant of that. I\u2019ve met tonight already...</p> </blockquote> <p>Question:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sorry to keep interrupting, but I want to pick up on the points that you\u2019re making. But for your theory to be true, people smugglers will have to offer a product like this \u2013 you can get on a boat to Australia, but there is a high chance that you might be turned back, if you\u2019re not turned back, you might be sent to Nauru and Manus. You might be able to get a medical evacuation [if you can get two doctors and a panel to say you need one]. If you get to Australia you might be able to lodge a court action and find yourself staying in Australia [in detention].</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t sound like an attractive product?<br></p> </blockquote> <p>Dutton:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well Leigh people are drowning on the Mediterranean. There are 1,200 people who drowned trying to get to Australia last time. That\u2019s the risk...</p> </blockquote> <p>Question:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You\u2019re saying as a result of this policy, it is making things more attractive for people to come to Australia. It is an unattractive product.</p> </blockquote> <p>Dutton:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No, this puts Australia back on the map for people smugglers and <strong>Bill Shorten</strong> has that on his shoulders. </p> <p>That\u2019s the reality what we have seen in the House tonight. We have got four kids left on Nauru who packed their bags ready to go to the United States. </p> <p>Nobody in detention on Nauru or Manus. We\u2019ve closed 19 detention centres and Mr Shorten, along with the Greens tonight, has taken a decision that he will unravel that success. </p> <p>He has announced also, I must say, if boats arrive, that those people are going to Manus, going to Nauru. What\u2019s the point of getting people off Manus and Nauru if you\u2019re only to fill them with new arrivals the following week? And I think Mr Shorten doesn\u2019t yet understand the full consequence of his decision tonight, but I think the Australian public do.</p> </blockquote> <p>Question:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The bill only applies to people who are currently on Nauru and Manus, how is it going to make it attractive and fill the place?</p> </blockquote> <p>Dutton:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the last election Bill Shorten was saying there was no difference on Operation Sovereign Borders between the Labor party and the Liberal party...</p> </blockquote> <p>Question:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No, that\u2019s not what I asked.</p> </blockquote> <p>Dutton:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The point I\u2019m making is you couldn\u2019t believe what Bill Shorten says when it comes to border protection. He says one thing before the election and he does the opposite after. If Mr Shorten is elected in May, this policy will apply to people newly arrived on Nauru. It will be a disaster. It will put kids back into detention and Mr Shorten will have to explain that failing if he is elected prime minister to the Australian people.</p> </blockquote> <p>Question:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hasn\u2019t the government created this situation for itself by not dealing with the 1,000 people who are on Nauru and Manus?</p> </blockquote> <p>Dutton:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No, that\u2019s false. We have got an arrangement with the United States where we now have about 500 people that have gone there...</p> </blockquote> <p>Question:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My point was about the timeliness?</p> </blockquote> <p>Dutton:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I would want people off Nauru and Manus. People that have come from Iran and found not to be refugees. We need to settle people in third countries and it was not the Labor party but our government that created the opportunity for people to go to the United States, we\u2019ve not ruled out people going to New Zealand in certain circumstances. </p> <p>So, yes, we\u2019ve dealt with a very difficult situation over a period of time, but we have done it in a way that hasn\u2019t seen kids drown. I haven\u2019t put one child into detention or Nauru. I have got every remaining child, as Scott Morrison stated, out of detention in Australia and I don\u2019t want to go back to those bad Labor days and I worry that Mr Shorten has fired the starting gun again for people smugglers.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T09:09:56.732Z\">at 9.09am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c628774e4b00ef6acc6c433\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T08:44:45.657Z\">8.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/quaedvliegs/status/1095242057382129664\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That\u2019s a cheap abrogation.

That is the first tranche of the border protection framework that we put in place in 2013. </p> <p>They have said that they will abolish that and they will restore providing permanent visas to people who illegally enter Australia. </p> <p>Tonight - and I should say last year - the Labor party voted on that occasion, in the Senate, without even taking any advice when it came to the national security implications to abolish offshore processing as we know it. </p> <p>This is the second tranche of the border protection regime that we have put in place. </p> <p>Now the Labor party may want to think that what they\u2019ve done tonight doesn\u2019t do that and it only demonstrates their lack of understanding about these issues. The Labor party have shown Australia tonight that they cannot be trusted on the second of those core planks of the border protection framework that have been so successful in stopping the deaths, getting the children off Nauru, getting children out of detention, ensuring that we could restore certainty and stability to our refugee and humanitarian intake. </p> <p>So when Bill Shorten tells you and the Labor party tells you that they can be trusted to turn back boats where it\u2019s safe to do so, I think the Australian people got their answer tonight. He can\u2019t be trusted to do that either. The Labor party and the Liberal and National parties are not on the same page when it comes to border protection. </p> <p>There is no bipartisanship on this issue. The Labor party have clearly demonstrated that under Bill Shorten\u2019s leadership. They want to go a different path and what we saw tonight was that, yet again, the Labor party have failed to learn their lessons of failure when they have had responsibility for border protection in this country. </p> <p>They have demonstrated, yet again, that they just don\u2019t understand how to protect Australia\u2019s borders. The importance of the outcome of protecting those borders is to ensure we avoid the human carnage of what we saw last time Labor had this opportunity. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T08:35:06.906Z\">at 8.35am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c627e43e4b042feedcbc1d5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T08:06:05.304Z\">8.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Scott Morrison press conference</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The prime minister says what happened tonight was \u201cproof positive\u201d the Labor party did not \u201chave the mettle\u201d to lead the nation.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c627e22e4b042feedcbc1d3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T08:04:59.821Z\">8.04am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RichardDiNatale/status/1095230312810856448\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Historic moment today, as parl votes to ensure innocent people on Manus/Nauru get the healthcare they need, when they need it.

In May last year the minister publicly stated that she had issued instructions for a subpoena relating to court proceedings brought by the Australian Workers\u2019 Union to be set aside. Given the minister has now agreed to appear before the court later this week on this matter, will she cooperate with the court by giving a full and frank account of her involvement in the leaking of details of the federal police raid on AWU offices to the media?</p> <p> <strong>Senator CASH</strong> (Western Australia \u2014 Minister for Small and Family Business, Skills and Vocational Education) (14:27): I thank Senator Cameron for the question. Senator Cameron, you are aware that the matter is before the court, so it would be inappropriate to comment, but of course I will absolutely cooperate with the court.</p> <p> Can I just make one small point in relation to what the proceedings themselves are actually about. The proceedings themselves are between the AWU and the Registered Organisations Commission. It is in relation to the proper authorisation of documents and donations made by the AWU to Mr Shorten\u2019s own election campaign and to GetUp. Despite what those on the other side say, that is actually what these proceedings are about. <strong>The PRESIDENT:</strong> Senator Cameron, a supplementary question.</p> <p> <strong>Senator CAMERON</strong>: I refer to reports that her former media adviser, Mr De Garis, has today told the court that he was informed in advance of the AWU raids by the minister\u2019s then chief of staff, Mr Davies. Is this correct? When did the minister first become aware of this conversation between Mr De Garis and Mr Davies?</p> <p> <strong>Senator CASH</strong>: Again, because the matter is before the court, Senator Cameron, it would be completely inappropriate for me to comment.<strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>Senator CAMERON:</strong> Did the minister have any conversation with her then chief of staff, Mr Davies, on or before 23 October 2017 with regard to foreknowledge of federal police raids on the AWU? Did she at any point in these discussions discuss tipping off the media about these raids?<strong><br></strong></p> <p> <strong>Senator CASH:</strong> Again, Senator Cameron, I have answered copious questions at estimates in relation to this matter. But, Mr President, as the matter is before the court, and Senator Cameron well knows this, it would be inappropriate to make further comment. But I do again remind Senator Cameron what the case is about. It is about the proper authorisations of donations made by the AWU to Bill Shorten\u2019s own political campaign and $100,000 to GetUp.

What I\u2019m about to share with you looks backwards. </p> <p>This is where the discussions started this morning, but it\u2019s interesting to be able to snapshot the process at different times.</p> <p>Labor, we know, has flagged three principles it wants adjusted.<br></p> <p><strong>The first is widening the scope of ministerial discretion to knock back medical transfers</strong>. </p> <p>The minister can knock back a transfer on security grounds in the bill as it stands, but Labor wants to expand the scope to include blocking transfers of people with criminal histories.</p> <p>So, again, to be clear, this is where the discussion started early this morning. The bill currently says the home affairs minister must approve the person\u2019s transfer to Australia unless that would be prejudicial to security.</p> <p>The new language says the transfer should be approved \u201cunless: the minister, in the minister\u2019s discretion, reasonably believes that the transfer of the person to Australia would be prejudicial to security within the meaning of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, including because an adverse security assessment in respect of the person is in force under that Act\u201d.<br></p> <p>A second criteria has been added.<br></p> <p>The transfer should be approved unless <strong>\u201cthe minister knows or, in the minister\u2019s discretion, reasonably suspects that the person has a substantial criminal record (as defined by subsection 501(7))\u201d.</strong></p> <p><strong>The second principle Labor is pursuing is time frames for determinations.</strong> The original bill said determinations be made within 24 hours. The amendment proposed this morning said omit within 24 hours and <strong>substitute \u201cAs soon as practicable after\u201d.</strong><br></p> <p>The word from the bunker is the parties are now back to a specific time frame, rather than <em>as soon as practicable</em>. I\u2019ve heard 48 hours, but nothing is certain yet. <strong>Kerryn Phelps </strong>made it clear it would need to be 72 hours at a minimum this morning.<br></p> <p>The third Labor negotiating principle is applying the enhanced procedures to the current cohort of people in offshore detention, not to new arrivals, in the event any new arrivals turn up.<br></p> <p>The Labor ring-fencing amendment specifies:<br></p> <p>\u201cA<strong> person is a relevant transitory person if: (a) the person is in a regional processing country on the day this section commences;</strong> and (b) in the opinion of a treating doctor for the person: (i) the person requires medical or psychiatric assessment or treatment; and (ii) the person is not receiving appropriate medical or psychiatric assessment or treatment in the regional processing country; and (iii) it is necessary to remove the person from a regional processing country for appropriate medical or psychiatric assessment or treatment\u201d.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T01:53:03.618Z\">at 1.53am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c622465e4b04a6f567dda07\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T01:42:33.887Z\">1.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We\u2019re now getting an early dose of \u201cjust how strong are our borders, very, but Labor will burn them down\u201d from <strong>Peter Dutton</strong>, because second Monday is the gift that just keeps on giving. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T01:50:51.572Z\">at 1.50am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c622348e4b042feedcbc001\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T01:37:55.997Z\">1.37am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is a pretty great example of \u201cwhatever, your face is\u201d.</p> <p>From <strong>Chris Knaus</strong>:</p> <p>The billionaire and major political donor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/huang-xiangmo\">Huang Xiangmo</a> has likened Australia to a \u201cgiant baby\u201d with \u201csimple folk customs\u201d while hitting out at a decision to cancel his visa.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/12/australia-is-a-giant-baby-banned-billionaire-huang-xiangmo-says?CMP=share_btn_tw\">Huang also criticised Australia\u2019s domestic spy agency for acting contrary to Australian support</a> for the One <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a> policy, and urged it to instead investigate journalists who he said may be \u201cserving foreign intelligence agencies\u201d and had stolen \u201cclassified information to gain attention and a spotlight\u201d.</p> <p>The Chinese tycoon was effectively blocked from re-entering Australia when his permanent residency visa was revoked and a citizenship bid was rejected</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T01:42:22.774Z\">at 1.42am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c622300e4b04a6f567dda03\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T01:36:49.091Z\">1.36am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Oof</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70513ef5a248e40b31dce3525853e9837835bbdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70513ef5a248e40b31dce3525853e9837835bbdf/0_0_4011_2674/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Wilson as the house of representatives resumes sitting in parliament house, Canberra this afternoon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Wilson as the House of Representatives resumes sitting in Parliament House, Canberra this afternoon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T01:41:48.612Z\">at 1.41am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c62218fe4b04a6f567dd9fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T01:30:10.586Z\">1.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Emma Husar</strong> is in parliament.

yesterday, but it may not have got all the attention it deserved because of all the other clusterforkery which was going on, but the auditor general gave a fairly bad mark to the home affairs department over how long it takes to process citizenship applications and visas.</p> <p><strong>Tony Burke </strong>has indicated Labor will have more to say about this today:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><a href=\"https://alp.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=942ebc4c1cf8fc522a4f4c50e&amp;id=66de988179&amp;e=2d118b04cb\">The ANAO audit report</a> into Peter Dutton\u2019s mega department titled \u201cEfficiency of the Processing of Applications for Citizenship by Conferral\u201d is completely damning.</p> <p>The auditor general has used unusually strong, unequivocal and unqualified language to condemn Dutton\u2019s Department of Home Affairs, amounting to a complete and total failure in administration. </p> <p>The audit found that over the past four years, the number of citizenship applications stuck in the pipeline <strong>blew out by 771%</strong>, with 244,765 applications on hand at 30 June 2018. </p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of Australian permanent residents, living in the community, who simply want to pledge their formal allegiance to Australia, deserve much better that having their lives placed on hold by the black hole of a department.</p> <p>There\u2019s no need for colourful phrases \u2013 this report speaks for itself. The direct and damning conclusions are:</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li> Applications for citizenship by conferral <strong>have not</strong> been processed efficiently by the Department of Home Affairs.</li> <li> Applications <strong>have not </strong>been processed in a time-efficient manner.</li> <li> Applications <strong>have not</strong> been processed in a resource-efficient manner.</li> <li> Processing times <strong>have increased,</strong> there is an underlying decline in processing performance, and long delays are evident between applications being lodged and decisions being taken.</li> <li> Significant periods of inactivity are evident for both complex and non-complex applications accepted by the department for processing.</li> <li> The Department of Home Affairs <strong>has not </strong>checked the quality of its decisions in 2017-18.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The auditor-general has called out the Department of Home Affairs for blatantly misrepresenting the facts to the parliament at Senate estimates, stating:</p> <p><em>\u201c[Audit] results indicate that the complexity of applications lodged has <strong>decreased</strong>. These results are at odds with Home Affairs\u2019 reported experience. For example, Home Affairs advised parliament at Senate estimates on 23 October 2017: </em></p> <p><em>\u2026 we have talked to this committee before about this \u2013 that the case load complexity is rising as we are seeing a flow-through of previous humanitarian entrants. It might well be the case that there are bigger delays now because the cases we are looking at now are actually more complicated\u201d.</em></p> <p>The ridiculous claim by successive ministers that the delays were caused by boat arrivals has been shown to be totally false. The auditor general revealed that in fact applications from the humanitarian stream decreased by 9% over four years from a low base, and that \u201cformer illegal maritime arrivals\u201d accounts for only 0.7% of lodgements in 2017-18. </p> <p>The report also reveals that Dutton\u2019s department ignored the law, taking it upon themselves to do nothing with thousands of applications even though changes to legislation had not been agreed by the parliament. The report states in regard to the government\u2019s unfair citizenship bill: </p> <p><em>\u201cWhen they were announced, the proposed changes to the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 were to apply retrospectively to applications received from 20 April 2017 onwards. Home Affairs advised the ANAO in June 2018 that: </em></p> <p><em>Staff were advised that the post 20 April applications were subject to the new requirements, <strong>however the requirements were not yet law</strong>. Therefore the applications were not able to be assessed against the existing requirements or the new ones announced by government.\u201d</em></p> <p>The Abbott-Morrison-Turnbull government\u2019s unfair changes were rejected by the parliament yet the Dutton\u2019s department has treated people appallingly, adding to delays and uncertainty.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-11T23:16:52.194Z\">at 11.16pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c61fd2ce4b00ef6acc6c170\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-11T22:58:32.982Z\">10.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Your one millionth reminder this is not about border security.</p> <p>The advice provided to the government includes this:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After noting the softening in Australia will feed in to marketing by people smugglers, the story becomes more complicated. \u201cAlthough people smugglers may claim there has been a shift in Australian policy and entry to Australia is now possible with just the opinion of two doctors, the resumption of large-scale people smuggling to Australia will remain dependent on a shift in potential illegal immigrant (PII) intent \u2013 not smuggler marketing.</p> <p>\u201cPIIs will probably be interested in any perceived or actual pathway where resettlement in a western country is guaranteed, even if such a pathway includes a period spent in detention.

The fact that treatment is available in PNG, Taiwan or Nauru would not restrict the recommendations by treating doctors to transfer. The individual would not be required to accept treatment in their regional processing country or another location that is not Australia.<br></p> <p>\u201cSome doctors have publically [sic] asserted that all transferees should be removed from Nauru and PNG for mental health reasons. Provided those doctors are appropriately registered or licensed and have \u2018assessed\u2019 transferees either remotely or in person, it will be open to him or her to form the opinion that any or all of the transferees are \u2018relevant transitory persons\u2019 and give the secretary notice of this, triggering the provisions in the amendments.\u201d<br></p> <p>A contention, unless I\u2019m not mistaken. Doctors. Gotta watch them. Always up to something.<br></p> <p>Moving on, the briefers note something the government hasn\u2019t exactly highlighted. \u201cOn transfer to Australia, <strong>the individuals would be detained under the Migration Act 1958 (Migration Act) and placed in held detention </strong>or in community detention by way of a residence determination\u201d.<br></p> <p>So this isn\u2019t quite \u201ctwo doctors say you can come to Australia, and freedom beckons\u201d, as a number of government frontbenchers have suggested during the past few hyperbolic days. It\u2019s come to Australia (maybe, if you meet the criteria) and get detained again.<br></p> <p>Despite the brief confirming medical transferees would continue to be detained, this is framed by the authors as a problem.<br></p> <p>\u201cPlacing up to 1000 people in held detention will put pressure on the detention network and with risk assessments, some, but not all, may be suitable for community detention. Those not suitable for community detention would be placed in held detention, likely necessitating the stand-up of the Christmas Island facility and removing our hot contingency fall back for Operation Sovereign Borders.\u201d<br></p> <p>The briefers worry word will get back to the people smugglers. \u201cThis path to Australia will likely reach people smugglers in a short period and they could rightly advise their clients that if they were sent at a future time to a regional processing location, they would only need to stay long enough to seek the recommendations of \u2018treating doctors\u2019 for transfer to Australia.</p> <p>\u201cWe expect that this may encourage those prospective clients of people smugglers who, to date, have not decided to travel due to the dissuasion of returns, turnbacks and regional processing. This bill removes the third pillar \u2013 regional processing\u201d.<br></p> <p><strong>Sounds bad, but several paragraphs later, the advice becomes more hedged. </strong>After noting the softening in Australia will feed in to marketing by people smugglers, the story becomes more complicated. \u201cAlthough people smugglers may claim there has been a shift in Australian policy and entry to Australia is now possible with just the opinion of two doctors, the resumption of large-scale people smuggling to Australia will remain dependent on a shift in Potential Illegal Immigrant (PII) intent \u2014 not smuggler marketing.<br></p> <p>\u201cPIIs will probably be interested in any perceived or actual pathway where resettlement in a Western country is guaranteed, even if such a pathway includes a period spent in detention. However, PIIs will probably remain sceptical of smuggler marketing and await proof that such a pathway is viable, or that an actual change of policy has occurred, before committing to ventures.\u201d<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-11T22:04:04.357Z\">at 10.04pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c61e94be4b042feedcbbe90\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-11T21:31:23.072Z\">9.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Kerryn Phelps </strong>on why she believes Labor blinked and, more importantly, why she believes everyone needs to get moving.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think you would have to speak to Labor about that, because, you know, what their motives are, you\u2019d have to ask them. </p> <p>But certainly I believe that there is a great willingness by many people in parliament to get a resolution to this today, or in the next few days, because, as I said, lives do depend on this. </p> <p>We cannot keep going the way we have been going, where the bureaucrats and the minister just block medical transfers by running them through the courts, by taking them to the federal court, only to find those ministerial decisions overturned and the doctors\u2019 decisions upheld. </p> <p>We need to find the right balance and the right balance is to have medical practitioners making decisions about the medical transfers because they\u2019re saying that they cannot cope on Manus Island and Nauru with particular cases. </p> <p>And the minister does need to have certain veto powers related to security for Australia, and if we can get the wording to everyone\u2019s satisfaction, let\u2019s do that today.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-11T21:58:18.586Z\">at 9.58pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c61e6afe4b04a6f567dd890\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-11T21:29:08.844Z\">9.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speaking to the ABC, <strong>Kerryn Phelps</strong> expanded on concerns she has about Labor\u2019s proposed amendment to broaden national security ministerial discretion to include people who have been convicted of a serious crime, when it came to the medical evacuation bill.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first thing is that these people have all been, if they\u2019ve been assessed as refugees under the refugee convention, they cannot have committed a serious crime in their home country. </p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>But we also need to look at what the definition of serious crime is, because if for example somebody has committed a crime in their country, which is a political crime, for example, complaining about something their government has done, been involved in a protest, being a human rights protester, a woman who has committed adultery who is sentenced to death by stoning \u2013 these are the sorts of things that might come under serious criminality and so we need to take a very careful look at that definition. </p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>And what I\u2019m very keen to do is to avoid being in exactly the same position where we are now, where the minister has excessive veto powers and runs every serious medical case through the courts, only to find that the doctor\u2019s original recommendations were upheld.</p> </blockquote> <p>Most of the people on Manus Island and Nauru have been judged to be refugees \u2013 not just by the UNHCR but also by Australian authorities.

Tomorrow, the Senate battle looms. My eye is already twitching. We are going to call it a night, but we\u2019ll all be back early tomorrow morning. A massive thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Gabrielle Chan and Paul Karp for all the intel, humour and food, and of course to the Guardian brains trust, who do more than you could ever know to keep this little project moving. Thank you to everyone who followed along with us today. It was fast moving and, at times, confusing and contradictory, so thank you for your patience as we worked out exactly what was going on. We\u2019ll be back just before 8am tomorrow. In the meantime \u2013 take care of you. And of course, Mike Bowers is still here. Outside the trashfire that was the parliament today, the end of days appeared to have arrived: A bit more from that 7.30 interview: Question: Do you think that most believe that a bill allowing for the evacuation of sick refugees will open the floodgates to boat arrivals on our shores? Dutton: Well Leigh we saw it when Mr Rudd came into government in 2007, when he said he wouldn\u2019t unravel the successful policies of John Howard. We saw 50,000 people arrive. We saw 8,000 children go into detention and it has taken us six years to clean up Labor\u2019s mess. Question: Are you saying that\u2019s what will happen under Labor\u2019s bill? Dutton: I believe we will see boats. I think there is no question that people smugglers will be hearing very clearly that the policy in Australia has changed and I think we need to be very cognisant of that. I\u2019ve met tonight already... Question: Sorry to keep interrupting, but I want to pick up on the points that you\u2019re making. But for your theory to be true, people smugglers will have to offer a product like this \u2013 you can get on a boat to Australia, but there is a high chance that you might be turned back, if you\u2019re not turned back, you might be sent to Nauru and Manus. You might be able to get a medical evacuation [if you can get two doctors and a panel to say you need one]. If you get to Australia you might be able to lodge a court action and find yourself staying in Australia [in detention]. That doesn\u2019t sound like an attractive product? Dutton: Well Leigh people are drowning on the Mediterranean. There are 1,200 people who drowned trying to get to Australia last time. That\u2019s the risk... Question: You\u2019re saying as a result of this policy, it is making things more attractive for people to come to Australia. It is an unattractive product. Dutton: No, this puts Australia back on the map for people smugglers and Bill Shorten has that on his shoulders. That\u2019s the reality what we have seen in the House tonight. We have got four kids left on Nauru who packed their bags ready to go to the United States. Nobody in detention on Nauru or Manus. We\u2019ve closed 19 detention centres and Mr Shorten, along with the Greens tonight, has taken a decision that he will unravel that success. He has announced also, I must say, if boats arrive, that those people are going to Manus, going to Nauru. What\u2019s the point of getting people off Manus and Nauru if you\u2019re only to fill them with new arrivals the following week? And I think Mr Shorten doesn\u2019t yet understand the full consequence of his decision tonight, but I think the Australian public do. Question: The bill only applies to people who are currently on Nauru and Manus, how is it going to make it attractive and fill the place? Dutton: At the last election Bill Shorten was saying there was no difference on Operation Sovereign Borders between the Labor party and the Liberal party... Question: No, that\u2019s not what I asked. Dutton: The point I\u2019m making is you couldn\u2019t believe what Bill Shorten says when it comes to border protection. He says one thing before the election and he does the opposite after. If Mr Shorten is elected in May, this policy will apply to people newly arrived on Nauru. It will be a disaster. It will put kids back into detention and Mr Shorten will have to explain that failing if he is elected prime minister to the Australian people. Question: Hasn\u2019t the government created this situation for itself by not dealing with the 1,000 people who are on Nauru and Manus? Dutton: No, that\u2019s false. We have got an arrangement with the United States where we now have about 500 people that have gone there... Question: My point was about the timeliness? Dutton: I would want people off Nauru and Manus. People that have come from Iran and found not to be refugees. We need to settle people in third countries and it was not the Labor party but our government that created the opportunity for people to go to the United States, we\u2019ve not ruled out people going to New Zealand in certain circumstances. So, yes, we\u2019ve dealt with a very difficult situation over a period of time, but we have done it in a way that hasn\u2019t seen kids drown. I haven\u2019t put one child into detention or Nauru. I have got every remaining child, as Scott Morrison stated, out of detention in Australia and I don\u2019t want to go back to those bad Labor days and I worry that Mr Shorten has fired the starting gun again for people smugglers. That leads to this exchange: Question: As home affairs minister, will you abide by the amendments on medical evacuations that passed today? Dutton: Of course we will. The law will be abided by as it always is. We brought a significant number of people here either for medical attention or people in a family unit to support the person coming here for medical attention, but I am worried about the consequences of the deal that\u2019s been struck between Mr Shorten and The Greens tonight... Question: Can I interrupt. I want to interrupt you because I want to pick up on something which is about already bringing people out for medical attention. Isn\u2019t there inconsistency that, it has been OK for you to do that, but it will, if Labor and the crossbenchers have their way, it will be opening Australia\u2019s borders? Dutton: Under the arrangements that Mr Shorten and the Greens passed through the House of Representatives tonight, we have people that can come to our country from Manus or Nauru. People that have been charged with child sex offences or have allegations around serious offences including murder. Question: And how many of those are on Nauru and Manus? Dutton: I would suggest to you that Australians don\u2019t want those people... Question: How many are on Nauru and Manus. People charged with serious offences like child sex offences? Dutton: We will release that detail if it is appropriate. Question: I\u2019m asking you as the minister tonight. Dutton: The government\u2019s approach is to make sure that the government determines who comes to our country and who doesn\u2019t. The Labor Party has clearly abrogated that responsibility and they are at the moment in reckless territory and I think Bill Shorten realises that, but the option for him was to see the left go completely off the reservation and he chose not to side with national security and I think it is a very dark day for the Labor party. Peter Dutton has found his way into the 7.30 studios. He echoes Scott Morrison with his belief that this is not a trigger for an early election. No, the independents have been clear about the fact that they support the government on the question of confidence and Kerryn Phelps said today that she would not support a no-confidence motion. What the vote was about today was a demonstration of whether or not Bill Shorten is capable of leading this country on the issue of board he protection. Clearly he has failed that very significant test and I think most Australians now see fortunately before the election, unlike the case with Mr Rudd, a Labor party unravelling a successful border protection policy. That\u2019s a disaster for our country. But despite the government saying it is an issue which is detrimental to border security, Dutton says he doesn\u2019t believe it is an issue of \u2018vital importance\u2019, as in an election trigger. We have got kids out of detention. We have medical staff up on Nauru for a population of 400 people. The claims are false in relation to the medical attention that\u2019s required. This is about Mr Shorten trying to appease the left of his party. Mr Shorten has chosen for, you know, the choice between trying to get the politics settled in his own ranks, he has chosen that option over the option of what is in our country\u2019s best interests and I think he stands condemned for his actions tonight. On the Senate numbers: Labor is a yes. Centre Alliance is a yes. The Greens are a yes. Tim Storer is a yes. Last year, Derryn Hinch was a yes. Now, he\u2019s a let me take a look at get back to you. All of the December 2018 Senate ayes would need to sign off on the amendments which have come from the House. Which means they need Hinch. Because it is very unlikely anyone from the government, One Nation, Brian Burston, Fraser Anning, David Leyonhjelm or Cory Bernardi are going to suddenly change sides on this. And from Centre Alliance: Centre Alliance welcomes today\u2019s vote on the amended asylum seeker medevac bill. Federal Member for Mayo Rebekha Sharkie said today\u2019s passage of the Home Affairs Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018 in the Lower House was a sensible and considered outcome for a humanitarian issue that has dragged on for too long. \u201cThis is good legislation that provides a medical solution for a medical problem,\u201d Rebekha said. \u201cIt addresses the concerns of national security and insufficient timeframes and it ringfences the legacy caseload of those people left on Manus and Nauru for more than five years.\u201d Centre Alliance\u2019s Immigration spokesman, Stirling Griff, said the Government should be ashamed that the Parliament has been forced to do what it would not. \u201cIt is appalling to think that some asylum seekers have been in offshore detention for more than five years and that their mental and physical health has been allowed to degenerate to such an extent that we have had to resort to this Bill,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Government might like to claim victory for having finally removed children from Nauru but it should hang its head in shame that it did not do so earlier, and not before some children had attempted suicide and were in a catatonic state \u2013 and will suffer ongoing PTSD as a result of their experience \u2013 all under this Government\u2019s watch.\u201d Rebekha said the compromise legislation passed in the Lower House completely negated the argument this legislation would act as a pull factor for people smugglers and open the floodgates. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear. Operation Sovereign Borders has not ceased and nor is it diminished in any way,\u201d Rebekha said. \u201cNo new asylum seekers have arrived at Manus or Nauru since 2014 \u2013 although I note that 34 boats have been turned back or returned to their country of origin. \u201cAustralia needs to take responsibility for those they have detained on Manus and Nauru. \u201cThis legislation deals only with those who have serious medical issues and it offers no permanent pathway to a new future. \u201cIt aims to provide temporary medical support for those needing critical care. \u201cWe now call on the Government to revisit the offer from NZ to resettle a large portion of those on Manus and Nauru so we can deal with this legacy issue. \u201cPeople should not have to face a lifetime in detention.\u201d Scott Morrison finishes with this: Right now \u2013 I should say still right now \u2013 the bill has not gone through the Senate. The provisions that relate to character, the provisions that relate to criminal conduct and all of these are stronger than what has gone to the parliament tonight. It is, as I said, there was no form of this bill that made our borders stronger and, frankly, there was no form of this bill that made it more humane. There are more than 60 medical professionals and medical-related staff on Nauru. More than 60, per head of population, in terms of those they are treating, you will find that to be greater than any part of this country. There are no children on Nauru other than the four that have their bags packed to go to the United States. Don\u2019t kid yourself out there to the Labor party and those who voted for this bill today and those who will do it in the Senate. Don\u2019t kid yourself that somehow you have improved the situation, you\u2019ve only made it weaker. What you\u2019ve done today is say to the Australian people and Bill Shorten in particular and the Labor party that you\u2019re prepared to trade on these issues, trade on these issues to compensate for your very real weakness and the Australian people have looked at Bill Shorten today and they\u2019ve found him weak \u2013 and he is. My eyes are a little crossed at this stage, but I am pretty sure that Christopher Pyne said earlier, when he was referencing the English civil war, that this move trashed, like, 109 years of parliamentary tradition. But I think Scott Morrison said it was no big deal because the Coalition did the same thing to Labor in 2013? The answer, obviously, can only be vodka. Why not call an election now? There\u2019ll be the opportunity for that in May and the Australian people will have an opportunity to decide on, not only these issues in May, because Bill Shorten and the Labor party have made it crystal clear that, at the next election, Australians will be deciding, once again, as they did in 2013, as they did in 2001, about whether they want the stronger border protection policies of the Liberal and National party or they want the weaker border protection policies of the Labor party. And in 2001 and in 2013 I thought they sent a very clear message. He reiterates he does not consider this to be a de facto no confidence motion. On whether he believes it to be a de facto vote of no confidence: No, of course it isn\u2019t. I refer you to Kerryn Phelps herself. This was not what that vote was about this evening. If the Labor party want to move such a motion, they should feel free to do so and it will fail. How do I know that? Because the independents have made that very clear. So it cannot be contorted into that type of an outcome. It was back in 2013, I\u2019ll reference it specifically if you like? Back in February of 2013, opposition amendments were passed, so this is just back in 2013, opposition amendments were passed on a superannuation legislation bill, service providers and other government measures bill, in very similar, if not the exact same, circumstances as these and the minority government, which was a Labor government at the time, was defeated. As for the historical precedence, there has been a lot of hyperbole about these things. The historical precedence need to be put into context. When I made the remarks I did earlier in the week, this is not a matter that goes to the issues that you\u2019ve raised and that\u2019s why it\u2019s not a matter that I intend to act on with those types of consequences. I\u2019m going to get about the business that I\u2019m about every day and that is to ensure we strengthen our economy, we make Australia more secure and we keep Australians together and we do the job we were elected to do. On what happens now, Scott Morrison says: My job now, as prime minister, my job up until now, I should say, is to do everything that was in my power to prevent these laws that weaken our border protection, that make all of us less safe when it comes to how our borders operate and now run the very real risk of seeing the boats run again and, believe me, every arrival is on Bill Shorten and Labor\u2019s head, every arrival, every risk is on his head. To answer the question David has put to me, my job up until now has been to prevent those bills passing and those bills have gone through the House of Representatives. My job now is to work with our border protection and security agencies to do everything in my power to mitigate the damaging impact of what Labor have done tonight. The minister for home affairs and minister for immigration, citizenship and multicultural affairs are meeting now with our border protection command to work through the contingency planning that we have been putting in place for this outcome. This outcome was not unexpected to me and, as a result, we have been putting contingency planning in place and I\u2019ll have more announcements to make about the actions and decisions the government will be taking to address now the risk and the threat that Labor and Bill Shorten have created. Scott Morrison says the bill will \u201cfollow the normal process\u201d \u2013 which means he will not attempt to stop it from getting royal assent. Scott Morrison: So it is a test that the Labor party and Bill Shorten have failed tonight. I made it very clear that the Liberal and Nationals parties would not be budging when it came to the issue of border protection in this country. We have had to clean up this mess twice. The Labor party, when they have the opportunity, only break what has been fixed and they have been demonstrating that again tonight in the parliament. Votes will come and they will go, they do not trouble me. Where we will always stand and the Australian people can always trust us to do is to have the metal to ensure the integrity of our border protection framework. Bill Shorten and the Labor party demonstrated tonight that they have no such metal, that they will easily compromise these things. They will be blown about by the winds of whatever may push them one way or the other. He cannot be trusted on our borders and Australia cannot trust Bill Shorten to make Australia stronger. He will make it weaker. Scott Morrison: What happened in the parliament tonight was proof positive that Bill Shorten and the Labor party do not have the mettle, do not have what is required and do not understand what is necessary to ensure that Australia\u2019s border protection framework and broader national security interests can be managed by the Labor party. The Labor party have already said that if they are elected that they will return to the policy of providing permanent visas, permanent visas that lead to citizenship for people who arrive or enter Australia illegally. That is the first tranche of the border protection framework that we put in place in 2013. They have said that they will abolish that and they will restore providing permanent visas to people who illegally enter Australia. Tonight - and I should say last year - the Labor party voted on that occasion, in the Senate, without even taking any advice when it came to the national security implications to abolish offshore processing as we know it. This is the second tranche of the border protection regime that we have put in place. Now the Labor party may want to think that what they\u2019ve done tonight doesn\u2019t do that and it only demonstrates their lack of understanding about these issues. The Labor party have shown Australia tonight that they cannot be trusted on the second of those core planks of the border protection framework that have been so successful in stopping the deaths, getting the children off Nauru, getting children out of detention, ensuring that we could restore certainty and stability to our refugee and humanitarian intake. So when Bill Shorten tells you and the Labor party tells you that they can be trusted to turn back boats where it\u2019s safe to do so, I think the Australian people got their answer tonight. He can\u2019t be trusted to do that either. The Labor party and the Liberal and National parties are not on the same page when it comes to border protection. There is no bipartisanship on this issue. The Labor party have clearly demonstrated that under Bill Shorten\u2019s leadership. They want to go a different path and what we saw tonight was that, yet again, the Labor party have failed to learn their lessons of failure when they have had responsibility for border protection in this country. They have demonstrated, yet again, that they just don\u2019t understand how to protect Australia\u2019s borders. The importance of the outcome of protecting those borders is to ensure we avoid the human carnage of what we saw last time Labor had this opportunity. The prime minister says what happened tonight was \u201cproof positive\u201d the Labor party did not \u201chave the mettle\u201d to lead the nation. The timing of the bill returning to the Senate is most likely to be tomorrow morning. The Senate adjourns in about 20 minutes, so it won\u2019t be tonight (most likely). The chamber comes back at 9.30 tomorrow morning. That is when the fun will begin. Asked if Labor will rule out a vote of no confidence, given the loss of the vote, Tony Burke says \u201cno opposition would ever rule that out\u201d. He says the key to whether the prime minister considers this a de facto vote of no confidence, he would have to decide if it was an issue of \u201cvital importance\u201d. Burke said it would be \u201cextraordinary and without precedent\u201d for a government to withhold royal assent \u2013 ie, not taking it to the governor-general. He indicates that would be a trigger for no confidence Tony Burke says the government pulled \u201can appalling act\u201d and a \u201ccheap stunt\u201d to stop the bill, but that Tony Smith \u201cto his credit\u201d, \u201cdid his job\u201d and made sure all the members had all the information they needed to make their decision. Bill Shorten is in a shadow cabinet meeting, for those wondering why he is not the one fronting the cameras here. Anthony Albanese says \u201cso many Australians have concerns with what is being done in their name\u201d to people under Australia\u2019s care. He says Labor listened to the advice and was prepared to compromise to make sure that the final outcome met all the requirements of border security and more compassion. And over in the Senate Tim Storer, who also played an instrumental role in getting this bill to this point, had this to say: Sick people in our care are now one step closer to get the quality of medical treatment they need, without jeopardising our borders. I am pleased to have been part of a process which has seen the Australian parliament at its best. None of those involved in the discussions which led to the amendments carried by theHouse of Representatives got everything they wanted. But, members of a number of parties, as well as independents, like myself, came together to achieve a result which should help sick people on Nauru and in PNG get the medical attention that we would expect for ourselves. These amendments would not have been necessary had the government not tried to use the courts to stop sick people coming to Australia for treatment. These amendments should bring this heartless practice to an end. Despite the government\u2019s efforts, more than 800 sick people have been brought to Australia for treatment, either by court order or by application to the court, without the people smuggling trade resuming. There is no reason to believe these amendments will change that. The government should accept the decision of the majority of members of the House of Representatives and the Senate \u2013 and allow the amendments through the upper house as quickly as possible. The people of Australia will not thank them for any attempts to delay this considered and humane measure. Behind the scenes were the human rights and refugee advocates. Here is what they had to say (as per their joint statement) Hugh de Kretser, Executive Director with the Human Rights Law Centre: Today we saw politics at its best with MPs across the floor working together to ensure a humane solution. The current medical transfer system is broken. People needing urgent medical assistance have severely deteriorated and even died. Notably, the coroner found that the death of young man Hamid Khazaei was caused by medical failure and delays. We need to stop risking lives. We now call on the Senate to pass this bill as soon as possible. Kelly Nicholls, Refugee Council of Australia (RCOA) spokesperson: The safety of lives must always come first. Doctors have been ignored for too long. People have died as a result. Pregnant women with complications have had to wait dangerously long to receive the treatment they need. Rape survivors have to had to have traumatic late-term abortions due to government blocks. This bill changes the response to medical emergencies in offshore detention on Manus Island and Nauru. Kon Karapanagiotidis, CEO, Asylum Seeker Resource Centre: Today is a landmark day. It is a victory for the national conscious of our nation and the triumph of compassion over the politics of fear and cruelty. Finally, the rights of people that we promised to protect and care for, while seeking sanctuary have been realised today. Shen Narayanasamy, Human Rights Director with GetUp: This is a watershed moment in Australian political history \u2013 because the 15-year trajectory of cruelty towards asylum seekers has ended. We thank the millions of people across this country who have fought so long for this victory and remember those people who have died in our name, that this bill would have saved. Brad Chilcott, Founder, Welcoming Australia: This bill simply ensures that people who need medical treatment get the care they need in order to save lives and alleviate suffering. The rest is political chicanery and fear-mongering. We congratulate those in the Labor, Greens and on the crossbench who have worked together to find consensus and call on the government to join them by putting human lives above any political considerations and allow this bill to swiftly pass through the Senate. Andrew Wilkie has put out a statement: The passing of the medical transfers bill is wonderful news for sick asylum seekers and refugees incarcerated in Nauru and on Manus Island. While offshore processing remains systemically cruel and illegal, at least this reform goes some genuine way to limit the cruelty and provide an alternative pathway to the court system. Today\u2019s vote is also a triumph for our democratic system because the parliament worked as it should. A majority of members represented their communities and worked cooperatively in the public interest. But this is just the beginning. The inhumanity and illegality will only ever be fully remedied when offshore processing is abolished, and when we\u2019ve put an end to the other diabolical elements of Labor and Liberal policy like mandatory detention, towbacks and temporary visas. Anthony Albanese and Tony Burke have called a press conference for 6.45pm. Scott Morrison has called one for 7pm. I have needed to go to the bathroom since 11am, but no one cares about that. This is what Anne Twomey was referring to Which is why the commentary has been around a \u201csubstantive\u201d legislative vote. Which was the Stanley Bruce government\u2019s in 1929. So, to be clear \u2013 the Fadden government lost a budget amendment, which was seen as a de facto no confidence motion (lost control of finances) in 1941 and the Bruce government lost a vote to give it more power over industrial disputes, a substantive piece of legislation in 1929. Both went to an election. Again, Scott Morrison has said he will not do that. Narrator: It wasn\u2019t. As seen by Mike Bowers: It is only the first day of parliament. The Morrison government has become the first since 1929 to lose a substantive vote on the floor of the House. The last time that happened, the Stanley Bruce government called an election the next day. Scott Morrison has already said he will not be doing that. Labor took out the renumeration issue, which took away the constitutional issues, and means the government has not lost control, even nominally, of the government\u2019s finances. The majority of the crossbench have said they are not interested in a no-confidence motion and they want the government to go full term. Someone would have to move a no confidence motion and then that same majority would have to support it. As for the bill, it heads back to the Senate, where there are the numbers to pass it. But that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be a long and drawn out process in terms of filibustering. That one is another win for Labor and the crossbench. It is done. The bill has passed the House. Cheers and applause break out from the gallery as the MPs leave the House. Paul Karp is in the chamber: For those who missed Scott Morrison\u2019s speech Labor and the crossbench win that one, 75 to 74. The vote moves on to agreeing to the amendments Bill Shorten has put forward. No one moves from their seat. Labor has circulated the amendments, and they look like the ones that Murph reported on earlier. With this add-on: (4) A person is not entitled to remuneration in respect of their position as a member of the panel. The crossbench look to have sided with Labor in the vote to bring Bill Shorten\u2019s amendments to a vote, now. This would be the third vote the government loses on this. A Labor MP just messaged to say they are keeping an eye on Christopher Pyne to see if he attempts to run off with the mace Brexit-debate style. I think they are only half joking. Things are quite tense on the government side. We are talking about a historic loss. The last time this happened, no one in that chamber was alive. That was quite the speech from Scott Morrison. I\u2019ll bring you some when I get a moment to transcribe, but he is not happy. The House is dividing. This is a group of people who were very aware of the visual impact they would be called upon to make today. The prime minister has come back into the chamber to argue against the amendments. He says it is \u201cnot the first time\u201d Labor has \u201cfailed the test\u201d on border protection. It\u2019s less than a minute in and you can tell he is fighting against the yell. And another reminder \u2013 if this bill passes the House, and it is looking like that is going to happen, then it goes back to the Senate. That sound you hear is the filibustering engine starting up. Bill Shorten is moving a motion to amend Christopher Pyne\u2019s reject the Senate amendments motion (stay with me) to have the House agree to the Senate amendments. Which, in short, means we are inching closer to the proper debate and vote on the medevac bill. This is actually something that happened. The government benches are looking very down. Christopher Pyne\u2019s \u201cthey will rue ...\u201d is not even enough to unfurrow the brows. \u201cThey will rue the day they established the precedent ... something, something angry.\u201d Christopher Pyne is both angry AND disappointed. Christopher Pyne is VERY upset by this. He is referencing England\u2019s civil war, where Charles I tried to put in a ship tax, and the parliament was all \u201cyeah, nah\u201d and the country went to war. I\u2019m not sure anyone on the other side of the chamber cares. But basically, Labor and the crossbench defeated the government\u2019s attempt in the parliament to have this bill declared unconstitutional. That\u2019s not a small deal. It is not over yet - Christopher Pyne is now attempting to move a motion that the Senate amendments be disallowed. Labor and the crossbench win that one as well. There is applause from the gallery. This vote is the \u201cget on with it\u201d motion Tony Burke has put forward (taking away the renumeration from the independent health panel to get around the section 53 issue). No one moves, and Labor and the crossbench win that one as well. Just a reminder the last time a government lost a substantial legislation vote was 1929. Ayes won 75 to 74. Now it is time for Tony Burke\u2019s amendments \u2013 looks like this is coming to the vote (minus the renumeration of the panel, which removes the money bill issue) From the Live Minutes, it looks like this is the vote on amending Christian Porter\u2019s motion, to include Tony Burke\u2019s amendments. If that makes sense. (Basically, Labor wants to amend Porters KILL IT WITH FIRE motion to get on with it) It looks like everyone is present and accounted for. The division bells are ringing. The first one is on the motion from Christian Porter to kill it. Then there is the amendment Tony Burke put in. As Katharine Murphy has just noted, Tony Burke has foreshadowed that Labor and the crossbench can amend the bill to specify that the medical panel not be paid. Constitutional law academic George Williams told Guardian Australia that would be an effective way to circumvent the section 53 constitutional problem by \u201cremoving the offending clauses\u201d so there is no appropriation. He said: \u201cThe only other option is to seek to change the bill in some way \u2013 you can put something in the bill to say they will receive no remuneration. You can get caught up in section 53 or seek to avoid the problem, and I think in this case the latter might be more pragmatic.\u201d Government MPs have just received a message from whip Nola Marino; Would Members please support the Ag in the HOUSE now if you can please. Thank you.\u201d So the short version of that is, Tony Burke is saying we are going to amend it so the panel doesn\u2019t get remunerated \u2013 taking away the money issue. He\u2019s saying let\u2019s just get on with it. Tony Burke is now arguing Labor\u2019s case. He says if the government had confidence in its arguments, he would not have asked the Speaker to keep the advice confidential. Here is what Anne Twomey told Sky a little earlier: Christian Porter says it is not a \u201ctechnical\u201d question, but one that is clearly laid out in the constitution. He says if the House passes the bill, it will give the power to control finances to the Senate. \u201cEverything that we do here has a consequence,\u201d he says. Christian Porter is attempting to convince the House to vote the bill down. He has warned against the \u201chaste\u201d in which the amendments were created. \u201cI will leave it in the hands of the House over how to proceed,\u201d Tony Smith says. The bill is up for debate in the House. Tony Smith is making a statement on the constitutional circumstances of the bill. Right. Stakes are RAISED. In the last 10 minutes, we have reached de-facto vote of no confidence territory. Why? As Anne Twomey, one of the nation\u2019s best constitutional experts, told Sky: \u201c... If the bill actually gets passed against the wishes of the government, that would be an indication that the government has lost control over the finances of the country. \u201cNow that is critical, in terms of confidence in loss of government. \u201c... Back in 1941, the Fadden government fell when its budget was reduced by one count. It just needs to be a nominal showing of the fact that the government has lost control of the finances. \u201cSo on the one hand, raising this may cause the House to decide, well, in the circumstances, we won\u2019t pass it in this form and so [doesn\u2019t] proceed, on the other hand, if it fails on this point, it is actually putting itself in a more vulnerable position in regards to the issue of confidence.\u201d To address one potential query \u2013 if the problem is that medical panel members would be paid, does the constitutional problem go away if they work for free? Solicitor general Stephen Donaghue\u2019s advice addresses the point by noting that the Remuneration Tribunal Act creates an obligation on the tribunal to determine the pay of people holding public office. Although the medevac bill itself doesn\u2019t contain provisions about pay, it will cause an expense to be incurred. The government could exclude panel members so that they aren\u2019t paid, but Donaghue said he is \u201cinstructed that the government has no intention of making such regulations\u201d. It seems to make good the section 53 constitutional point, the government has said \u2013 yes, panel members will be paid. And then Turns out it is not too late to say you are sorry Solicitor general Stephen Donaghue\u2019s advice is that the medevac bill breaches section 53 of the constitution but he ultimately says it is up to the House of Representatives what to do about that, so the advice is unlikely to stop the bill in its tracks. Section 53 provides that the Senate \u201cmay not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people\u201d \u2013 that is, cause more money to be spent. Donaghue notes the bill would create an independent health advice panel, whose members the remuneration tribunal would be required to pay out of consolidated revenue. He concludes that the \u201cbetter view is that the Senate amendments did contravene section 53 of the constitution\u201d. But Donaghue adds a significant caveat \u2013 that the high court has ruled that section 53 is a procedural provision in which the court does not interfere. He says: \u201cIn circumstances where the question of compliance with s53 of the constitution is non-justiciable, the ultimate arbiter as to the operation of that provision is the parliament ... In light of the above ... it is ultimately for the House of Representatives to decide whether it considers the Senate amendments to be consistent with s53 and, if not, how it wishes to respond to the contravention of that provision.\u201d From a quick check of Donaghue\u2019s reference to page 449 of the House of Representatives Practice (7th edition) it seems the lower house has lots of options, including remaking amendments on the same terms, refraining from judging whether the bill is unconstitutional and agreeing to the amendment, or \u201cmaking no objection in view of uncertainties of interpretation\u201d. So this is not a insurmountable barrier if the lower house is still up for passing it. In processing the plot twist, let\u2019s start with the attorney general Christian Porter\u2019s advice to the Speaker, which is dated February 10. \u201cThe government considers that as the Senate amendments do not observe the requirement of the constitution, they must be properly set aside,\u201d he says. Porter says the direct legal effect of the Senate amendments passed last December is \u201cto dictate an increase in expenditure under an existing appropriation. As such, the Senate amendments contravene the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution\u201d. (In simple language, this means money bills are supposed to originate in the House, not the Senate. Remember too the medical evacuation bill is an amendment to government legislation, it is not a private member\u2019s bill introduced by Kerryn Phelps, even though it is referred to routinely as the Phelps bill). Porter says if the House passes the bill this afternoon, it would \u201ccontravene both sections 53 and 56 of the constitution, and subvert centuries of Westminster tradition by which financial initiative lies with the government, and money bills must originate in the lower house.\u201d On that basis, the only course of action is \u201cto refuse to entertain the Senate amendments to the omnibus bill\u201d. Porter then asks the Speaker, Tony Smith, not to circulate the advice. Porter says it is provided \u201con a confidential basis for the limited purpose of assisting you in your consideration of the Senate amendments\u201d. Smith declined that kind offer and circulated the advice. It was only February 5 that Scott Morrison said he didn\u2019t care if the government lost this vote: If we lose that vote next week, so be it. We won\u2019t be going off to the polls,\u201d he said on Tuesday night. The election is in May. I will simply ignore it and we\u2019ll get on with the business. But I\u2019m not going to be howled down by the Labor party, who want to dismantle a border protection system I had a key hand in building. The solicitor general\u2019s advice is dated February 7. Christian Porter wrote to the Speaker on February 10, asking him to keep that advice secret. Tony Smith wouldn\u2019t do it, which is why we know about it. So I guess it wasn\u2019t \u201cso be it\u201d after all. Speaking to the ABC, Richard Di Natale said the House should get on with the job and pass the legislation \u2013 \u201cjust get on with it\u201d and let it be challenged in the high court, if the government believes it to be unconstitutional. \u201cThe solicitor general has got it very badly wrong in the past; our job is to get on with it and legislate and help those people,\u201d he says. In short... it\u2019s complicated. Mike Bowers tells me Stuart Robert \u201cis crying\u201d in the House. He\u2019s talking on Labor\u2019s matter of public importance, which is on the misconduct of the banks. Tony Smith told us this advice was dated February 7. Basically, money bills need to originate in the House, not the Senate. That\u2019s because of the \u201cburden\u201d on the taxpayer. Let\u2019s remember this is the advice from the solicitor general, who also advised the government that the section 44 MPs were fine. It\u2019s legal advice and can be wrong. Ultimately, it is only the high court which can decide what is unconstitutional. The gist of the advice the Speaker was talking about is the bill is a \u201cmoney bill\u201d which can not have been introduced in the Senate without offending section 53. But there are caveats. It\u2019s quite a few pages. We\u2019ll get through it and then let you know Speaker Tony Smith has received a letter from the attorney general, Christian Porter, on the medevac bill, which includes advice from the solicitor general. Porter asked Smith to keep the advice confidential. Smith says, as Speaker, he needs to table it. And so he is. Plot twist (but what, we don\u2019t yet know): I have received correspondence from the attorney general dated 10 February and attached opinion from the solicitor general dated 7 February relating to the Senate\u2019s amendments to the Home Affairs\u2019 legislation amendment miscellaneous measures bill 2018. The Senate message relating to this bill is to be reported after the matter of public importance. Which is why I am giving this initial statement now, for reasons that will become obvious. I have determined that I will table the correspondence from the attorney for the information of honourable members. When I table that correspondence at the conclusion of my statement, members will see that the attorney general, in his letter to me, states that the opinion he attaches to his correspondence from the solicitor general is provided to me on a confidential basis, and to quote the attorney general, quote, \u2018I would appreciate you not circulating it further.\u2019 I have advised the attorney general that as Speaker, it is important that I ensure in this instance material available to me is also available to all members of the house. As a consequence, I have also decided to table the solicitor general\u2019s opinion. Copies of the tabled documents will now be available at the end of the table. And yes, we are running to the tables office. Greg Hunt finishes a dixer, and despite only 50 minutes of questions, Scott Morrison stops question time (also, I imagine, stopping Labor from asking Stuart Robert another question which would be allowable). But David Littleproud and Joel Fitzbibbon both managed to agree with each other on the need to work together when it came to the flood response in Queensland, with Littleproud thanking Queensland Labor premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and Scott Morrison for working together to make sure immediate financial relief reaches the farming communities. Sometimes, this place can work how it is supposed to. Another question to Stuart Robert is ruled as being out of order, because of a preamble. Scott Morrison mouths something like \u201ctoo bad\u201d to Bill Shorten across the table. Is this a sign? Just sharing more of the language in the current draft of the medical evacuation bill, with the caveat that talks aren\u2019t yet concluded, so details could change. From the draft amendments circulated this morning, which I shared with you earlier, a note has been added. It reads: \u201cAny transitory person who is brought to Australia for a temporary purpose must be kept in immigration detention whilst in Australia. That immigration detention must continue until the time of removal from Australia or until the minister determines that immigration detention is no longer required.\u201d The current draft amendments make it clear that the minister can override a decision to transfer a person from Nauru or Manus by the expert medical panel on security grounds, AND also if the minister \u201cknows that the person has a serious criminal record\u201d and \u201cthe minister reasonably believes the person would expose the Australian community to a serious risk of criminal conduct\u201d. The current draft says the minister must make a decision \u201cas soon as practicable after being informed by the panel of its findings and recommendations\u201d. There\u2019s a caveat though: \u201cif the minister was informed by the panel that the person\u2019s transfer is necessary to prevent an imminent risk to the person of death, serious illness or serious injury, no later than 24 hours after being informed by the panel of its findings.\u201d Mike Bowers spent some time in the Senate: Mark Dreyfus to Stuart Robert: I refer to his responsibility for taxation and administration. [And to reports] that the failed lobbying firm delivered over $100,000 to the treasurer\u2019s infamous forum shortly before going into liquidation with debts of over $430,000, including to the tax office. Has the minister sought advice as to whether these donations were clawed back, so that the revenue can be invested into schools, hospitals and infrastructure, instead of the Liberal party. There is some argy bargy over whether the question is OK. A quick update from the federal court in Melbourne: David De Garis has been out of the court room for most of the afternoon as lawyers for the AWU ask the judge if they can cross-examine him. The union\u2019s lawyer, Herman Borenstein QC, argued earlier that Michaelia Cash\u2019s former media adviser had been \u201chiding behind a mantra of not being able to recall\u201d as he gave evidence. Frank Parry SC, the barrister for the union regulator, the Roc, is opposing the request and the parties have been putting arguments about this since lunchtime. The court has now adjourned to return at 9.30am on Wednesday. De Garis will then return to the witness stand, followed by Cash\u2019s former chief of staff Ben Davies. De Garis earlier indicated that it had been Davies who told him federal police were set to raid the AWU\u2019s offices. The court heard that Friday has been set aside for Cash to give evidence. Michael McCormack just ripped a piece of paper as he said \u201cnot worth the paper it is written on\u201d and honestly, I think it was the first time in those three minutes three quarters of the chamber realised he was still speaking. I swear to Rhianna, if you took a drink for every time Michael McCormack said \u201cMr Speaker\u201d in his dixer responses, you would be on the floor before the first minute was up. Clare O\u2019Neil to Scott Morrison: The prime minister and every member of his government voted against the banking royal commission not once, not twice, but 26 times. Why did the prime minister vote against the banking royal commission 26 times? Why did he ignore the victims of the banks to protect the top end of town, and prime minister, why can\u2019t you just say you\u2019re sorry? Josh Frydenberg is back: The question is, is the leader of the opposition sorry for the 10,000 victims, over what happened [in] the Storm Financial crisis? The reality is, we on this side of the house provided a comprehensive response to the Hayne royal commission. We are taking action on 76 recommendations. We are putting in place protections for Australian consumers. Greater accountability measures for the financial system. We are ensuring our regulators are fit for purpose. When the leader of the opposition was the financial services minister, he said they were the best in the world. We are taking action to make sure people get redress. An opportunity to be heard and compensated where they have suffered misconduct. There is a clear contrast. Those opposite are playing politics. We are getting on with taking action. We are getting on with ensuring that the financial system, the interest of consumers, are put first. We understand the misconduct that has occurred, which has been documented in detail by the royal commission, broken businesses and broken lives. Profits put ahead of people Mr Speaker. Greed that led to those outcomes. That is why we are taking action on all 76 recommendations. As for the Labor party, either they do know what they are waiting for, I\u2019m not sure who they are trying to appease, but with double the time to consider the royal commission, they haven\u2019t produced the response. Anne Aly has pulled out the fidget spinner to get through this next dixer. Tanya Plibersek to Scott Morrison: The prime minister voted against the banking royal commission 26 times, tried to give the big ranks a $17 billion handout, and is now delaying action on the banking royal commission until after the election. Isn\u2019t it the case that this prime minister just cannot be trusted when it comes to the banks, because he is only ever interested in looking after the top end of town? Josh Frydenberg takes it: There is only one side of politics in this house which is getting on with taking action on the 76 recommendations, Mr Speaker. It is we on this side of the house, taking action on the 76 recommendations. And those opposite who were demanding that the report be put out immediately, demanding that they see the report so they can immediately respond to it, have had the report now for eight days, and there is no response, Mr Speaker. Let me read to you what the member for Hotham said eight days ago. The member for Hotham said we will implement every single recommendation that is indeed [in the] royal commission\u2019s report. Well, where is the response? Where is the response?\u201d But that attack seems a little strange, given that the government is also accusing Labor of wanting to destroy mortgage brokers (with one of the recommendations in the Hayne report being a change to how mortgage brokers make their fee, from the banks, to the client) Because you can\u2019t have no response if you are also trying to \u201cabandon 26,000 Australians working with mortgage brokers\u201d. Josh Frydenberg just said something about Labor putting a tax on electricity (among other taxes) and Chris Bowen wants to know WHAT TAX ON ELECTRICITY Not even the front bench, at least in the hook, also known as flagpin corner, is pretending to be interested in the government dixers. Probably because they have already had to repeat them ad nauseam on their local radio stations and TV interviews. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Is the prime minister aware that in a candid interview earlier this week the minister for defence was reported to have said, and I quote, \u201cMalcolm is Aslan to me\u201d. Noting that the pathway to Narnia is through the cabinet, will the prime minister finally tell the Australian people, including the minister for defence, why Malcolm Turnbull is no longer the prime minister of Australia? The question is ruled out of order, to the disappointed groans of most of the Labor caucus and, judging by the smiles some in the Coalition are trying to hide, some in the government benches agree. Trevor Evans gets so excited about his dixer, he has to start it again. It\u2019s the most interesting thing to occur within those five minutes. Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has apologised for not calling the banking royal commission earlier. Can the now prime minister confirm media reports that he was, in fact, the reason for the delay? And will the prime minister now say sorry for delaying the banking royal commission by voting against it 26 times? Morrison: I refer the member to my comments last year on this matter, where I made it very plain, my regret on not having called the royal commission sooner, but I reminded the member that I\u2019m the treasurer at the time who did call the royal commission. Labor comes alive, because it has been a long time between lols and, well, they needed one today. Morrison: And I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019m the prime minister \u2026 who received the report of the commission and I\u2019m the prime minister who is acting on the recommendations of the royal commission. I\u2019m the prime minister who, when treasurer, introduced the banking executive accountability regime. I\u2019m the prime minister who was the treasurer, who was with the minister for revenue and financial services, who introduced the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, and increased funding for Asic to ensure that they had the powers and had the penalties and had the resources to do the job. When the leader of the Labor party was the minister for financial services ... What did he do? What did he do? Nothing! Did he call a royal commission? As leader of the opposition, did he even draft a terms of reference for a royal commission? No! When it comes to financial services, the leader of the opposition seized people\u2019s problems as only a prop for political opportunism. Second Monday just keeps on coming up with the goods \u2013 Clive Palmer is in the gallery today. Because it is not enough that he is on billboards, every second TV and radio ad and our nightmares. He must also turn up in person. While we suffer through the first dixer, which is on \u201cthe government\u2019s plan for a strong economy\u201d, let\u2019s head to the Senate where this exchange has occured: Senator CAMERON (New South Wales) (14:26): My question is to the minister for small and family business, skills and vocational education, Senator Cash. In May last year the minister publicly stated that she had issued instructions for a subpoena relating to court proceedings brought by the Australian Workers\u2019 Union to be set aside. Given the minister has now agreed to appear before the court later this week on this matter, will she cooperate with the court by giving a full and frank account of her involvement in the leaking of details of the federal police raid on AWU offices to the media? Senator CASH (Western Australia \u2014 Minister for Small and Family Business, Skills and Vocational Education) (14:27): I thank Senator Cameron for the question. Senator Cameron, you are aware that the matter is before the court, so it would be inappropriate to comment, but of course I will absolutely cooperate with the court. Can I just make one small point in relation to what the proceedings themselves are actually about. The proceedings themselves are between the AWU and the Registered Organisations Commission. It is in relation to the proper authorisation of documents and donations made by the AWU to Mr Shorten\u2019s own election campaign and to GetUp. Despite what those on the other side say, that is actually what these proceedings are about. The PRESIDENT: Senator Cameron, a supplementary question. Senator CAMERON: I refer to reports that her former media adviser, Mr De Garis, has today told the court that he was informed in advance of the AWU raids by the minister\u2019s then chief of staff, Mr Davies. Is this correct? When did the minister first become aware of this conversation between Mr De Garis and Mr Davies? Senator CASH: Again, because the matter is before the court, Senator Cameron, it would be completely inappropriate for me to comment. Senator CAMERON: Did the minister have any conversation with her then chief of staff, Mr Davies, on or before 23 October 2017 with regard to foreknowledge of federal police raids on the AWU? Did she at any point in these discussions discuss tipping off the media about these raids? Senator CASH: Again, Senator Cameron, I have answered copious questions at estimates in relation to this matter. But, Mr President, as the matter is before the court, and Senator Cameron well knows this, it would be inappropriate to make further comment. But I do again remind Senator Cameron what the case is about. It is about the proper authorisations of donations made by the AWU to Bill Shorten\u2019s own political campaign and $100,000 to GetUp. Don\u2019t actually forget what the court case is about, despite everything you say. Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister: this government has created a part-time parliament by scheduling just 10 sitting days in eight months. Why is the prime minister stopping the parliament sitting for more days, which will prevent the parliament from legislating the recommendations of the banking royal commission before the election? And after voting against the banking royal commission no less than 26 times, why is the prime minister insisting on another delay? Morrison (not a quote) We\u2019ll hand down a budget surplus. You\u2019re welcome. He moves to the royal commission: It\u2019s now been seven days \u2013 eight days and we are still waiting for a response to the royal commission from the leader of the opposition. The leader of the opposition in the Labor party is [responding in principle]. Are we going to have in-principle budget if ever elected? Have we going to have in-principle border protection? Are we going to have in-principle budgets in the future. No! And we just hit the hour mark. Question time is yet to begin. The language in the draft amendments circulating at the moment from Bill Shorten says on timeframes: The minister must make a decision under subsection (2): (a) as soon as practicable after being notified; and (b) unless the decision is made on the ground set out in paragraph (3)(a)\u2014no later than 72 hours after being notified. Again, according to the current draft of the amendments, the revised time frame for determinations applies to the security assessments for asylum seekers. The draft amendment says: \u201cWithin 72 hours of the minister being notified, Asio should advise the minister if the transfer of the person to Australia may be prejudicial to security within the meaning of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (including because an adverse security assessment in respect of the person is in force under that Act) and if that threat cannot be mitigated.\u201d Julie Collins is now speaking about the Tasmanian fires. Bob Katter is back on his feet. He has a story about sandbagging. Cathy O\u2019Toole is also speaking on this motion (Herbert is in north Queensland, taking in Townsville.) Bob Katter tries to speak again. I don\u2019t know why. I am not sure if Bob knows why. Tony Smith certainly has no idea and sits him down. George Christensen (Dawson) is now adding his speech to the motion. There are 149 or so people in the chamber right now trying to look solemn while Bob Katter speaks on the natural disaster indulgence motion, while having no idea what the speech is about. There are some very interesting facial contortions going on at the moment and more shifting in chairs than the occupants of a kids table on their last warning before dessert. We are rapidly approaching the 45-minute mark in what should be question time ... and not a single question has been asked as yet. Bob Katter, whose electorate of Kennedy is among one of the worst impacted by the floods in north and western Queensland, said it is a \u201cgreat honour\u201d to be able to speak on this area, which makes up \u201cone tenth\u201d the surface area of Australia. The House moves on to a motion acknowledging the natural disasters across the country. Over in the Senate, the government, seemingly sensing a deal is very close to being struck on amendments to the medevac bill, are now talking on the Greens motion \u2013 including Mathias Cormann, who rarely speaks himself on stuff like this. What that does is delay the government reaching its own legislative agenda. Which delays any other business, if you are picking up what I am putting down. It is inching closer Scott Morrison is now moving a motion acknowledging the 10-year anniversary of the Black Saturday bushfires. Yes, even Bob Katter is in the parliament. Just as an update, everyone is in their seat. Ann Sudmalis and Jenny Macklin are back from their New York UN exchange. Quips aside, a bit more from Cory Bernardi and the filibustering on demand: \u201cIt really depends on what it ends up like, but I am opposed to the bill as it stands,\u201d he tells Guardian Australian political editor Katharine Murphy. The chamber has been called to order. It\u2019s dealing with a few condolence motions first, so question time is a few minutes off. Just a quick by-the-by on the asylum bill before we enter the hour of glower: folks with longish memories will remember that last year the government was saved by Cory Bernardi, who engaged in a filibuster to ensure the Coalition was not humiliated by losing a vote on the floor of the House for the first time since 1929. Cory talked and talked and talked to prevent that humiliation. I thought it prudent to ask Bernardi if he was ready to talk and talk and talk again, in the event the medical evacuations bill passes the House amended later today and has to bounce back up to the Senate for amendments. Cory is, of course, happy to serve. I am always available to contribute to Senate processes in the best way possible. Question time is about to begin. I\u2019ll be heading into the chamber, so hit me up with your QT predictions! Peter Dutton was asked about the AFP\u2019s role in what happened to refugee footballer Hakeem al-Araibi by Samantha Maiden earlier today and said he believed Andrew Colvin would have something to say on it, some time in the future. But Craig Foster, who was absolutely instrumental in bringing Hakeem al-Araibi home, had this to say about moving forward: There\u2019s no question that, going forward, there will have to be a thorough investigation into the role of the AFP in what occurred with this red notice. For many reasons. One is because, as the public, we need to be completely confident that the processes have been followed and, secondly, we need to ensure that the system is going to be changed. And one of the issues to come out of this \u2026 as I said before, we intend to ensure that we utilise this case to hold people accountable within the governance of sport, and there are some people here within Asia and elsewhere who we don\u2019t think have acted appropriately. And that\u2019s a big issue for us in sport. We think that this was very much about the soul of sport, which has been sold and money has infiltrated the values of both football and other sports and we think that it\u2019s time to start to climb that back, and Hakeem al-Araibi standing here and talking to Australia is a big blow in that regard. But also we want to see an investigation into Interpol and the use of red notices itself \u2013 not just Australia\u2019s role, which was after the Interpol red notice was placed on him. But this concept of countries using the red notice in order to try to re-foul people that they want to return for nefarious reasons has to now become a very serious issue and it is something that we\u2019ll be taking up in the coming months. Labor is supporting a motion moved by Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young calling for the cap on water buybacks in the Murray-Darling Basin plan to be repealed immediately. An emotional Hanson -Young asked her Senate colleagues to back the repeal of the cap, saying that the objectives of the plan had been corrupted due to politics and corporate greed. The cap was introduced by legislation into the plan in 2015 by the Coalition, which feared the backlash in rural communities from the economic impacts of buybacks. But this left the plan far more reliant on other measures to meet the overall target of recovering 2750GL for the environment. These alternatives include projects to help manage the river better, removing constraints on the river, more efficient farming practices and reducing evaporation. The latest drought and the spectacle of hundreds of thousands of fish dying in the Darling at Menindee has focussed attention on whether the plan is actually working. Hanson-Young says it\u2019s clearly not working, as evidenced by recent reports and the fish deaths. \u201cThe prime minister might want us to pray for rain, but clearly something is rotten and it needs to be cleaned up now,\u201d she said. \u201cMillions of dead fish, a stressed river and some pretty happy irrigators.\u201d She pointed the finger clearly at the former water minister, Barnaby Joyce, and the Nationals. \u201cThe system has been overallocated for decades and we have to give water back to the environment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what tricks of accounting this government does, mother nature is crying out for help,\u201d she said. Hanson-Young is also backing a royal commission. Labor had backed the cap in 2015, but is now supporting its removal, which would require an amendment to legislation. A report by the Productivity Commission found that buying water rights from farmers is a far more efficient way of returning water to the environment and that projects designed to achieve similar outcomes were both uncertain and expensive. As I have just been reminded, if the crossbench comes on board with Labor\u2019s proposed amendments to the medevac bill, and then it is passed in the House, it will have to go back to the Senate, because it\u2019s been amended from the bill which was originally sent through to the House. And we all know what happened the last time this bill was in the Senate. Let\u2019s come back to (medevac bill) time frames for a minute I can only apologise really. There are so many moving parts it\u2019s almost impossible to deliver smooth and linear coverage of a process that is neither smooth, nor linear. I mentioned earlier the intel out of the talks was the time frame for determinations was heading for a landing point of 48 hours rather than where things started at the beginning of the day, which was as soon as practicable. People are now counseling me away from 48 hours. Several people are saying what\u2019s under discussion at this moment is a seven-day time frame, with provision for urgent medical transfers. Just flagging this more up-to-date advice in the event this is where things ultimately settle. I\u2019ve been saying all morning this is a movable feast. We just have to keep moving. I think we have already established that facts don\u2019t seem to matter in this debate one iota. The Senate is still debating the Murray-Darling Basin motion, but Labor has added amendments which would allow a bill to remove the 1500GL cap buyback. The latest Guardian Essential poll has landed. As Katharine Murphy reports: The banking royal commission findings appear to have delivered a political fillip to Labor, with the opposition extending its lead over the Coalition 55% to 45% on the two-party-preferred measure. The new Guardian Essential poll, taken before Monday\u2019s major party brinkmanship on asylum seekers in the lead-up to the resumption of parliament, puts the government\u2019s primary vote on 34% and Labor\u2019s on 38%, and the independents\u2019 share of the vote has risen to 11%, up from 9%. The positive movement in Labor\u2019s direction follows a shift in favour of the Coalition in last week\u2019s survey. Last week Labor was ahead of the Morrison government on the two-party-preferred measure 52% to 48% \u2013 a shift within the margin of error from the last voter survey of last year, and one in mid-January that had Labor ahead 53% to 47%. The fallout from the banking royal commission, controversy over the Liberal Tim Wilson\u2019s use of a taxpayer-funded inquiry into Labor\u2019s policy on franking credits to leverage a partisan campaign, and an escalating political brawl about border protection dominated the news last week. That follows on from yesterday\u2019s Newspoll, which had Labor leading the government 53 to 47. AAP has an update on last week\u2019s parliamentary network cyber-hack attempt: The hunt for the perpetrators of a sophisticated cyber-attack on Australia\u2019s federal parliamentary computer network is continuing. Security industry sources have told AAP it is possible China could be the source of the latest breach. Senate president Scott Ryan told parliament it would be some time before the investigation would be completed, saying he could not yet attribute blame for the intrusion. \u201cIt is important to understand the methods used by malicious actors are constantly evolving and no network, including the parliamentary computing network, is considered 100 per cent secure,\u201d Senator Ryan said on Tuesday. But Senator Ryan stopped short of blaming the global superpower while the Australia Signals Directorate and the Department of Parliamentary Services investigate the hacking. MPs and staff changed their passwords on security advice after last week\u2019s attack. \u201cI can assure the Senate this action was carried out as a standard security incident response procedure and precautionary measure to protect user access and information,\u201d Senator Ryan said. Michael Keenan, who has very strong opinions on a lot of things in this interview \u2013 mostly how terrible this bill is and how it will bring the borders crashing down \u2013 can\u2019t give an example of where the amendments would fail to meet the government\u2019s concerns, because he is not going to get into \u201cevery hypothetical situation\u201d. Funny that. Michael Keenan just said on Sky that a doctor \u201clike the one yesterday who said the detention centres were worse than Auschwitz\u201d (not an exact quote, but the spirit) could sign off on the transfer. Here is what Dr Paul Bauert actually said: Speaking to Sky News (on Monday), Dr Bauert explained the doctors\u2019 concerns: The longer these people are there, the worse they are getting. We know that the main, the main reason for the impairment of mental health, as Viktor Frankl, the psychiatrist from Auschwitz described very well in his book, Man\u2019s Search for Meaning, the main problem these people have is the lack of meaning, the lack of any end to what is going on. A lack of certainty. And this more than anything causes severe mental health damage. Even those that finally knew they were about to be condemned to the gas chamber, at least found some sense of relief in knowing what was happening. So, all of these people without any idea of what is going to happen to them, what their future is, will be suffering on a daily basis. And we have seen from some of the television shows, and the media that have followed them, once they have been released, that all of them end up with severe, significant mental health problems which will take a long, long time to settle, with most having post-traumatic stress disorder. I am concerned, all the doctors are concerned, that the longer this politicking goes on, the longer these people are left in this critical situation, the worse their health is becoming. Keenan said it goes to the \u201cmindset\u201d of some of the people wanting to make these changes. A copy of Labor\u2019s amendments has fallen into my hands. What I\u2019m about to share with you looks backwards. This is where the discussions started this morning, but it\u2019s interesting to be able to snapshot the process at different times. Labor, we know, has flagged three principles it wants adjusted. The first is widening the scope of ministerial discretion to knock back medical transfers. The minister can knock back a transfer on security grounds in the bill as it stands, but Labor wants to expand the scope to include blocking transfers of people with criminal histories. So, again, to be clear, this is where the discussion started early this morning. The bill currently says the home affairs minister must approve the person\u2019s transfer to Australia unless that would be prejudicial to security. The new language says the transfer should be approved \u201cunless: the minister, in the minister\u2019s discretion, reasonably believes that the transfer of the person to Australia would be prejudicial to security within the meaning of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, including because an adverse security assessment in respect of the person is in force under that Act\u201d. A second criteria has been added. The transfer should be approved unless \u201cthe minister knows or, in the minister\u2019s discretion, reasonably suspects that the person has a substantial criminal record (as defined by subsection 501(7))\u201d. The second principle Labor is pursuing is time frames for determinations. The original bill said determinations be made within 24 hours. The amendment proposed this morning said omit within 24 hours and substitute \u201cAs soon as practicable after\u201d. The word from the bunker is the parties are now back to a specific time frame, rather than as soon as practicable. I\u2019ve heard 48 hours, but nothing is certain yet. Kerryn Phelps made it clear it would need to be 72 hours at a minimum this morning. The third Labor negotiating principle is applying the enhanced procedures to the current cohort of people in offshore detention, not to new arrivals, in the event any new arrivals turn up. The Labor ring-fencing amendment specifies: \u201cA person is a relevant transitory person if: (a) the person is in a regional processing country on the day this section commences; and (b) in the opinion of a treating doctor for the person: (i) the person requires medical or psychiatric assessment or treatment; and (ii) the person is not receiving appropriate medical or psychiatric assessment or treatment in the regional processing country; and (iii) it is necessary to remove the person from a regional processing country for appropriate medical or psychiatric assessment or treatment\u201d. We\u2019re now getting an early dose of \u201cjust how strong are our borders, very, but Labor will burn them down\u201d from Peter Dutton, because second Monday is the gift that just keeps on giving. This is a pretty great example of \u201cwhatever, your face is\u201d. From Chris Knaus: The billionaire and major political donor Huang Xiangmo has likened Australia to a \u201cgiant baby\u201d with \u201csimple folk customs\u201d while hitting out at a decision to cancel his visa. Huang also criticised Australia\u2019s domestic spy agency for acting contrary to Australian support for the One China policy, and urged it to instead investigate journalists who he said may be \u201cserving foreign intelligence agencies\u201d and had stolen \u201cclassified information to gain attention and a spotlight\u201d. The Chinese tycoon was effectively blocked from re-entering Australia when his permanent residency visa was revoked and a citizenship bid was rejected Oof Emma Husar is in parliament. Or at least, outside it. Bridget McKenzie just gave the greatest Mike Moore hhhhmmmmmmmmmm to Kim Brennan (gold medallist and chair of the Australia Olympic Committee\u2019s Athletes Commission) I have heard in quite some time. Peter Dutton is in the second most fancy government press spot to talk about this: The minister for sport, the Hon Bridget McKenzie and the minister for home affairs, the Hon Peter Dutton, will outline the Australian government response to the Wood Report of the Review of Australia\u2019s Sports Integrity Arrangements. He is talking about weekend kids sport and something, something cricket. Folks following on at home can see there are a lot of moving parts on the asylum story. The parts are still moving. But here is the best update I can provide about where things are currently at: If we can look through the noise of the news cycle, with people assuming ambit positions, it seems that negotiations are proceeding behind the scenes relatively productively. I hear the Greens \u2013 having threatened to sink the package this morning \u2013 are now back at the table, having had some of their concerns assuaged. So don\u2019t assume they kill the legislation. It might happen, but it doesn\u2019t look like it right at the moment. Specifically, I hear a time frame for determinations (which was Richard Di Natale\u2019s main concern) has been resolved. The word is 48 hours, not 24 as was originally proposed. All the information I have to hand suggests the other crossbenchers are still at the table. There was a flurry about 20 minutes ago about the whereabouts of the Labor MP Emma Husar, but Labor people assure me she\u2019s in Canberra. I guess it remains moot whether she is in the building at the critical time. Pack lunch and a drink bottle. It\u2019s going to be a long day. In the Senate, Labor is supporting this Greens amendment: The Senate: 1. Notes with alarm: a. The crisis that has unfolded in Menindee Lakes over the summer with unprecedented fish deaths; b. The Productivity Commission report into the implementation of the Murray Darling Basin plan; c. The findings of the South Australian Murray Darling Basin Royal Commission; and d. The 1500GL cap on water buybacks for environmental water. 2. Is of the opinion that the 1500GL cap on water buybacks be repealed. 3. That so much of standing order 111 be suspended, as would prevent Senator Pratt moving that the following bill be introduced at 6 pm today: A Bill for an Act to amend the Water Act 2007, and for related purposes. Short Title: Water Amendment (Purchase Limit Repeal) Bill 2019. This is all moving very fast today (which makes sense, because really, there is not a lot of time to get this sorted). Joel Fitzgibbon was seen chasing Cathy McGowan, Kerryn Phelps, Julia Banks and Rebehka Sharkie out of the chamber when they left, and chatting to them outside the door for quite some time. Emma Husar (who we all hope is OK) is in Canberra, but not in the parliament. The Greens want amendments to the amendments. And everyone who was going to say yes late last year has to say yes now for it to pass. Strap in. Also the bad show has seemingly lived up to its (nick)name In the Senate, which, for the first time in quite some time, is NOT the centre of the clusterforkery, Sarah Hanson-Young is attempting to suspend standing orders to debate what on earth has happened with the Murray-Darling Basin plan, and the ecological disaster we saw earlier this year. It is always fraught to predict what anyone will do, but Labor sources have told us Emma Husar is in Canberra. Which is a start, because I doubt Labor will be given a pair, if Husar doesn\u2019t show for the vote, given Labor announced it would be cancelling pairs in cases of absolute majorities. Emma Husar has just tweeted this This is a MAJOR problem for the numbers, even if Labor and the crossbench come to an agreement. From Rosie Lewis and Michael Roddan at the Australian: Rogue Labor MP Emma Husar has not turned up to parliament, potentially causing a major upset for Bill Shorten who could have an historic win over the government on the medevac bill and cause chaos for Scott Morrison by adding an extra two sitting weeks to the calendar. Labor sources have confirmed the party was trying to locate Ms Husar, who has been estranged from her colleagues since she says she was forced not to contest her Sydney electorate of Lindsay and was \u201cslut shamed\u201d in the midst of a controversy over her management and treatment of former staffers. The whole story is here The bells have rung. The mad house is officially open for business. Oh \u2013 the government is still not chipping in any money for the cross river rail, Queensland\u2019s number one infrastructure project (for like, ever) because the state Labor government got fed up with the lack of commitment and said it would fully fund it itself. So Alan Tudge said now that it\u2019s fully funded, the government will spend the money it would have used to fund it, but didn\u2019t actually commit to it, elsewhere in Queensland. Some days, I literally can\u2019t even with this place. \u201cTeam Queensland\u201d, which is absolutely a thing (for reasons which escape me because even a cursory look over the marketing would suggest that is a terrible idea) has gathered behind Alan Tudge to welcome the southeast Queensland city deal. (Peter Dutton is the \u201ccaptain\u201d of Team Queensland. These are actually things which are said by people with power in this place.) From the release: The Morrison government has committed to working with the Queensland government and local councils in south-east Queensland to develop a City Deal for the region. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the federal government was already delivering billions of dollars of funding for congestion-busting roads and rail projects and this new deal would help unlock further investment. \u2018I want people to get home sooner and have dinner as a family. I want tradies to spend less time on the road and more time at the worksite,\u2019 the prime minister said. \u2018We want to ensure Queensland remains a major tourism destination and one of the world\u2019s premier locations to live, work and raise a family.\u2019 It will be the second City Deal for Queensland following the policy being first established in Townsville. It comes in addition to the Morrison government piloting a Regional Deal for the Bundaberg Hervey Bay region. The commitment to an SEQ City Deal is supported by Queensland LNP MPs and senators who have campaigned for funding to support the diverse sectors within the region including tourism, manufacturing and education. The Morrison government has been working with the SEQ Council of Mayors, in particular Lord Mayor Graham Quirk, on the recently released People Mass Movement study which explores the impact of population growth on the region\u2019s ability to cope with future transport demand. Minister for Cities, Urban Infrastructure and Population Alan Tudge said the Liberal and Nationals government was committed to the people of south-east Queensland and to making the region even more liveable than it already is. \u2018South-east Queensland is already home to over two thirds of the state\u2019s population and is expected to accommodate 5.3 million people within 25 years\u2019 time,\u2019 Minister Tudge said. \u2018We need to cater for this rising population and the SEQ City Deal will be a huge step forward in making sure the people of south-east Queensland get the most out of living in this beautiful region. Speaking after his Sky News interview, Richard Di Natale said Labor needed to come back to the negotiating table, now that the party had moved the goal posts: The Labor party need to decide if they\u2019re going to work with the Greens, the crossbench, the refugee advocates, indeed many decent people right across the country who want to see sick people get the care when they need it,\u201d he said. Right now, the concern that we have \u2013 and this is based on considered legal opinion \u2013 is the amendments put forward by the Labor party may make the situation worse than doing nothing. We are currently seeing some people \u2013 albeit it far too slowly \u2013 being evacuated from Manus and Nauru for medical treatment. The amendments \u2013 particularly the amendment that proposes an open time frame in terms of when evacuations should occur \u2013 could actually make it harder than is currently the case. So what we need to see is we need to see the Labor party ... We need to see Bill Shorten stop playing politics. He supported this legislation in December. He supported this legislation, and now over the space of two months, a bit of pressure from the Morrison government and from some of the rightwing media and he\u2019s going to water. All this and the bells marking the beginning of the first 2019 sitting haven\u2019t even rung yet. This is shaping up to be a margarita day. Ben Davies, from memory, left Michaelia Cash\u2019s office in January last year, with \u201cfamily\u201d given as the official reason. Michaelia Cash\u2019s former chief of staff Ben Davies told her then media adviser, David De Garis, that federal police were set to raid the Australian Workers Union\u2019s offices, the federal court has heard. De Garis was ordered on Tuesday to give evidence about his decision to tip off the media about the dramatic raids in October 2017, after Justice Mordecai Bromberg rejected his request to refuse to answer to avoid self-incrimination. Asked who had told him, De Garis told the court: \u201cChief of staff Ben Davies.\u201d Davies is Cash\u2019s former chief of staff and is also scheduled to give evidence this week. De Garis said Davies had asked him to come to his office and had told him in person that the raids would take place later that afternoon. He said could not remember any details beyond that. The AWU\u2019s lawyer, Herman Borenstein QC, questioned De Garis\u2019 evidence, saying he was \u201cloth to do this\u201d before asking Bromberg whether he could ask leading questions. \u201cYou have not been loth to do this but I\u2019m happy to,\u201d De Garis replied, before he was asked to leave the courtroom briefly. \u201cThere is a real question about whether he\u2019s trying to answer the questions truly and frankly \u2026 or hiding behind a mantra of not being able to recall,\u201d Borenstein said. But Bromberg said he was \u201cnot satisfied the witness is not making a genuine attempt\u201d. De Garis is continuing to give evidence. The Greens, making fetch happen at the Adani protest this morning, as seen by Mike Bowers. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve actually got a specified figure, you don\u2019t improve the situation, you potentially make it worse,\u201d Richard Di Natale says of the lack of a time figure on the timing of the ministerial approval or rejection. Basically, the Greens want an absolute watertight timeframe put on how long the minister can take to approve or reject a transfer request. The legislation at the moment says 24 hours. The government argued that was not enough time. Labor proposed amending it to something along the lines of as soon as is practical. The Greens say that will just allow the government to delay dealing with transfers as long as they want. \u201cIf you need urgent medical care, you don\u2019t need to go to court, you need a doctor. And urgently,\u201d Di Natale said. The Greens leader said the party is \u201copen to a conversation\u201d but they believe the three amendments just \u201cmake it harder\u201d for people to get medical treatment. Richard Di Natale says the Greens won\u2019t support any amendment which means it takes longer for asylum seekers and refugees to get medical treatment. \u201cThe amendments that have been put forward by the Labor party, at the moment, potentially make the situation worse than doing nothing,\u201d he tells Sky News, saying that is what he has been told from the refugee sector and those who have followed these cases through the courts. Tony Burke had a chat to ABC Adelaide radio this morning. The transcript reports this exchange: BEVAN: Now your opposite number is Christopher Pyne from South Australia. He\u2019s the manager of government business. We learned yesterday that he saw Malcolm Turnbull as his \u201cAslan\u201d. Do you see Bill Shorten as your \u201cAslan\u201d? CLARKE: And for those playing along at home Aslan of course is? BEVAN: The lion, from The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Do you dreamy-eyed look across at Bill Shorten saying, you\u2019re my Aslan? BURKE: I\u2019ve got to say it does fall short of that. I loved those CS Lewis books as a kid. I read them all. Every single one of them. But of course Aslan is there is a bit of a \u201cChrist figure\u201d and I don\u2019t think any member of parliament quite fits that bill. CLARKE: So is Bill Shorten your luck dragon maybe? BURKE: Bill\u2019s the leader of the party and I really, really hope that we get a Shorten Labor government soon. You can find that reference in David Wroe\u2019s story, here And I guess that makes Pyne ... Edmund? The PMO has released the transcript of Scott Morrison\u2019s doorstop this morning: JOURNALIST: Prime minister, if you lose the medevac bill today, why should you not drive to Government House and call an election? PRIME MINISTER: It\u2019s not a matter [inaudible], that\u2019s why. I mean, the independents have said that themselves. So I think they\u2019ve answered their own question. That matter will be determined I assume later in the parliament today. I have made it pretty clear that the bill is acceptable in no form. We will not be giving any comfort or any licence for the parliament to support this in any way, shape or form. JOURNALIST: Will you allow it to come on for a debate today though? PRIME MINISTER: It does come on for a debate today, that\u2019s the process. JOURNALIST: So you will consider absolutely no Labor amendments to this bill whatsoever? PRIME MINISTER: This bill is acceptable in absolutely no form. It only weakens our borders, it does not strengthen them. I will not give a leave pass to this parliament to weaken our borders. Thanks very much. You may remember from Luke\u2019s report yesterday, that David de Garis declined to answer how he found out about the AWU raid. Looks like shiz is about to get reeeal interesting in the federal court. From this morning For any National party voters, that guy in the red tie is the leader of the party and the deputy prime minister. Labor of course, is not having a caucus meeting this morning, having spent two hours dealing with those issues last night. On citizenship issues, Paul Karp has this report: Labor has released advice warning the government bill to lower the bar for stripping terrorists of Australian citizenship is unconstitutional as it prepares to dissent on the usually bipartisan security committee. The advice, written by Victorian QC Peter Hanks, said there is a \u201creasonable argument\u201d granting home affairs minister Peter Dutton the power to revoke citizenship merely on his subjective belief the person is a dual national is not supported by the constitution. The release of the advice comes after the shadow foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, told caucus on Monday night Labor is likely to issue a dissenting report on the bill on the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, a first for them in this term of opposition.\u201d You can read the rest of that here Jordon Steele-John will introduce the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Audio Description) Bill 2018 to the Senate today, which, if passed \u201cwould enable equal access to television for the 385,000 people in Australia who are blind or have low vision\u201d. We reported on this yesterday, but it may not have got all the attention it deserved because of all the other clusterforkery which was going on, but the auditor general gave a fairly bad mark to the home affairs department over how long it takes to process citizenship applications and visas. Tony Burke has indicated Labor will have more to say about this today: The ANAO audit report into Peter Dutton\u2019s mega department titled \u201cEfficiency of the Processing of Applications for Citizenship by Conferral\u201d is completely damning. The auditor general has used unusually strong, unequivocal and unqualified language to condemn Dutton\u2019s Department of Home Affairs, amounting to a complete and total failure in administration. The audit found that over the past four years, the number of citizenship applications stuck in the pipeline blew out by 771%, with 244,765 applications on hand at 30 June 2018. Hundreds of thousands of Australian permanent residents, living in the community, who simply want to pledge their formal allegiance to Australia, deserve much better that having their lives placed on hold by the black hole of a department. There\u2019s no need for colourful phrases \u2013 this report speaks for itself. The direct and damning conclusions are: Applications for citizenship by conferral have not been processed efficiently by the Department of Home Affairs. Applications have not been processed in a time-efficient manner. Applications have not been processed in a resource-efficient manner. Processing times have increased, there is an underlying decline in processing performance, and long delays are evident between applications being lodged and decisions being taken. Significant periods of inactivity are evident for both complex and non-complex applications accepted by the department for processing. The Department of Home Affairs has not checked the quality of its decisions in 2017-18. The auditor-general has called out the Department of Home Affairs for blatantly misrepresenting the facts to the parliament at Senate estimates, stating: \u201c[Audit] results indicate that the complexity of applications lodged has decreased. These results are at odds with Home Affairs\u2019 reported experience. For example, Home Affairs advised parliament at Senate estimates on 23 October 2017: \u2026 we have talked to this committee before about this \u2013 that the case load complexity is rising as we are seeing a flow-through of previous humanitarian entrants. It might well be the case that there are bigger delays now because the cases we are looking at now are actually more complicated\u201d. The ridiculous claim by successive ministers that the delays were caused by boat arrivals has been shown to be totally false. The auditor general revealed that in fact applications from the humanitarian stream decreased by 9% over four years from a low base, and that \u201cformer illegal maritime arrivals\u201d accounts for only 0.7% of lodgements in 2017-18. The report also reveals that Dutton\u2019s department ignored the law, taking it upon themselves to do nothing with thousands of applications even though changes to legislation had not been agreed by the parliament. The report states in regard to the government\u2019s unfair citizenship bill: \u201cWhen they were announced, the proposed changes to the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 were to apply retrospectively to applications received from 20 April 2017 onwards. Home Affairs advised the ANAO in June 2018 that: Staff were advised that the post 20 April applications were subject to the new requirements, however the requirements were not yet law. Therefore the applications were not able to be assessed against the existing requirements or the new ones announced by government.\u201d The Abbott-Morrison-Turnbull government\u2019s unfair changes were rejected by the parliament yet the Dutton\u2019s department has treated people appallingly, adding to delays and uncertainty. Your one millionth reminder this is not about border security. The advice provided to the government includes this: After noting the softening in Australia will feed in to marketing by people smugglers, the story becomes more complicated. \u201cAlthough people smugglers may claim there has been a shift in Australian policy and entry to Australia is now possible with just the opinion of two doctors, the resumption of large-scale people smuggling to Australia will remain dependent on a shift in potential illegal immigrant (PII) intent \u2013 not smuggler marketing. \u201cPIIs will probably be interested in any perceived or actual pathway where resettlement in a western country is guaranteed, even if such a pathway includes a period spent in detention. However, PIIs will probably remain sceptical of smuggler marketing and await proof that such a pathway is viable, or that an actual change of policy has occurred, before committing to ventures.\u201d The boats didn\u2019t stop attempting to come to Australia, they have just been turned back. Australia\u2019s turnback policy will remain in place. Scott Morrison invited the cameras in for the first party room of the year: We are now confronting the full-scale natural disaster, national disaster of what is happening in western and northern Queensland. I want to particularly commend Linda Reynolds for the way that she has managed and coordinated those efforts and particularly Linda thank you to the Australian defence force, who\u2019ve been there, not just to do the work, but to provide that great encouragement to Australians, just by their sheer presence and turning up. But I want to thank you for the work you have done with emergency management to prepare, because we knew it was going to be a difficult season with bushfires. And to have the aerial assets ready and in place, I want to commend you for that, and to Michael Keenan and the work that has been done by Human Services to ensure that the payments have been getting out. I mean, just as of last Sunday, as I said at the Press Club yesterday, almost $40m in cash support within a week. To get support to those families. That\u2019s government in action. That\u2019s government dealing with issues that the Australian people are facing. And Michelle, I know, you have seen the same thing in your electorate. Australians are strong. Australians are resilient. Under our government, we are going to continue to make Australia even stronger. That\u2019s what we are about. A stronger economy, stronger borders, stronger services, that\u2019s a stronger Australia. And that\u2019s what we are about. Our opponents have plans that will make Australia weaker. To weaken the economy, to weaken our borders. And you can\u2019t pay for services with money that\u2019s not there and we all know that Labor cannot manage money. Here we are colleagues taking up this fight on behalf of the strong Australian people, backing them in, backing small business, lower taxes, the infrastructure they need, whether it\u2019s supporting farmers in drought or supporting farmers in flood, we are there and we\u2019ll be there, not just in the crisis, and the recovery, but we\u2019ll be there for their prosperity in the future because those days will come and we believe in that and we believe in them. So that is our charge. That is our mission. We are united together in doing that. But before I go any further, there has been one element in our team that has been missing and his name\u2019s Arthur! ... He\u2019s back! And Arty, why don\u2019t you say a few words, mate. Arthur Sinodinos (who is back from sick leave, which he took while undergoing cancer treatment): Thanks, prime minister. All I\u2019m going to say is, first and foremost, when I\u2019ve been out there talking to our people as I\u2019ve come back to work, there is a real fighting spirit out there, a view that we can win this, and, as long as we provide a clear alternative, articulate that alternative and work as a team, we\u2019ll get there, we can win this. The only other plea I would make is, Michael McCormack, no more singing, stick to your day job! (That last bit is because McCormack is an Elvis impersonator, who recently attended the Parkes festival where he attempted to sing, what at one point, may have been an tune in the style of Elvis.) Also happening today \u2013 a world record ending in Canberra, raising money and awareness for child victims of family and domestic violence. Norm Bartie will arrive in parliament house, in his digger, after travelling 5500km in the excavator, at a top speed of 30km/h. Norm\u2019s wife Rikki described it to me like this: The journey has taken him from Brisbane \u2013 Townsville \u2013 Toowoomba \u2013 Wagga Wagga \u2013 Echuca \u2013 Canberra. The aim of the journey was to raise awareness for children who have been affected by domestic violence, abuse and trauma, and to raise funds for our not-for-profit organisation \u2018It\u2019s NOT Your Fault 4 Kids\u2019, as well as taking this message to all kids along the way (that the abuse they have suffered from is NOT their fault, as opposed to what most of these children have as their core belief). Norm has raised $12,000 so far, enough to fund three retreats, with ongoing support, for a number of children this year. That takes some dedication. And in a week like this one is shaping up to be, is a much welcome reminder of the good in people. Timing is of the essence with all of this though. There are only two sitting weeks scheduled ahead of the budget. This fortnight is practically it, if there are any changes to be made ahead of the election. Bill Shorten knows it: This issue is capable of resolution. It is possible in Australia to have strong borders without treating people cruelly. It is possible to make sure that treating medical clinicians, who are looking after people, that their advice is given the appropriate weight. Australia can have strong borders and be compassionate to the treatment of people and their care. Penny Wong had a few things to say about Scott Morrison this morning. The Senator is not impressed. \u201cFear is all he has left,\u201d she said of Morrison. \u201cHe can\u2019t run on his record, because his record is cuts and chaos, he can\u2019t run on stability because they are so bitterly divided. \u201cSo what does he want run on? He wants to run on a fear campaign.\u201d There is an Adani protest out the front of parliament today. It never stops. Adam Bandt has also weighed in on Labor\u2019s proposed amendments to the medivac bill. He\u2019s told us he is not overly happy. That doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t engage in discussions about it though: \u201cOn first look, Labor\u2019s amendments don\u2019t make the current terrible situation any better. Labor is giving a lot of power back to Peter Dutton and it\u2019s not clear that sick refugees will come to Australia any quicker than they do now.\u201d From the \u201cwasn\u2019t expecting that\u201d box, AAP has reported: The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, has apologised to Kevin Rudd after calling the former prime minister a sociopath on live television. Senator Di Natale acknowledged the term was a \u201cserious slur\u201d and a clinical condition of mental illness. \u201cI unreservedly retract the suggestion that you are a sociopath,\u201d he wrote last week in a letter to Rudd and cited by the Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday. \u201cI realise that this is a serious slur on your reputation as it is a clinical condition of a mental illness.\u201d Di Natale made the comment during a Q&amp;A program on ABC television in December. In a special second Monday treat, Gabrielle Chan is in the office today, forming part of the Guardian brains trust. Morning, everyone, I\u2019ve had a quick conversation with Kerryn Phelps after her round of interviews this morning. On Labor\u2019s three principles, it\u2019s clear there is room to move on time limits for decision making, as long as there\u2019s an upper limit in the amendment. The upper limit being 72 hours looks likely at this stage. Labor\u2019s desire to ring fence the current cohort in offshore detention also looks doable. The hard yards will be on expanding ministerial discretion. Phelps is keen to ensure that the reworking doesn\u2019t become too broad so that home affairs ministers get the opportunity to deem everyone a risk on character grounds. That looks to be the major sticking point, given Labor will want ministerial remit to be as broad as possible, given the Coalition\u2019s political attacks about the potential to let murderers into the country. But all this is speculative at the moment. The crossbenchers are meeting shortly, then there will be meeting with Labor, consultations with stakeholders, and the actual drafting of amendments. It\u2019s going to be a busy day. Bill Shorten was also stopped on the church steps and asked about the medevac bill (of course): \u201cI think the current government confuses stubbornness with strength,\u201d he said. And then, for some reason explained that concept further. \u201cThey think they are being strong when they are just being stubborn.\u201d On the bill: \u201cWhat we want to do is make sure that whilst we maintain strong borders, we treat refugees humanely and provide the appropriate medical care for people who require it \u2026 This issue is capable of resolution.\u201d Oh good. The bipartisanship of the traditional prayer service lasted for exactly as long as it took MPs to walk out of the church. Both Scott Morrison and Bill Shorten spoke on the medical evacuation bill, practically on the steps of the church. Morrison said he would not give \u201ca licence for the parliament to support this in any way shape or form\u201d. \u201cThis bill is acceptable in absolutely no form, it only weakens our borders, it does not strengthen it, I will not give a leave pass to weaken our borders.\u201d On that, it is worth revisiting Murph\u2019s analysis of the security advice the government keeps referring to: Officials argue the current ministerial discretion in the bill to reject people cleared for medical transfer on security grounds isn\u2019t wide enough. Consistent with the culture of the home affairs department, the briefers also clearly object to doctors being decision makers. The officials say a lot of doctors don\u2019t like offshore detention, ipso facto: \u201cMany doctors in Australia and their professional associations have called for an end to regional processing and it is expected that their recommendations under these amendments would be forthcoming in a short period. \u201cIt is expected that within four weeks of Royal Assent, should the bill pass the House of Representatives, that most of the 1000 individuals would be in contact with \u2018treating doctors\u2019 willing to recommend their transfer to Australia for at least medical assessment if not treatment. The fact that treatment is available in PNG, Taiwan or Nauru would not restrict the recommendations by treating doctors to transfer. The individual would not be required to accept treatment in their regional processing country or another location that is not Australia. \u201cSome doctors have publically [sic] asserted that all transferees should be removed from Nauru and PNG for mental health reasons. Provided those doctors are appropriately registered or licensed and have \u2018assessed\u2019 transferees either remotely or in person, it will be open to him or her to form the opinion that any or all of the transferees are \u2018relevant transitory persons\u2019 and give the secretary notice of this, triggering the provisions in the amendments.\u201d A contention, unless I\u2019m not mistaken. Doctors. Gotta watch them. Always up to something. Moving on, the briefers note something the government hasn\u2019t exactly highlighted. \u201cOn transfer to Australia, the individuals would be detained under the Migration Act 1958 (Migration Act) and placed in held detention or in community detention by way of a residence determination\u201d. So this isn\u2019t quite \u201ctwo doctors say you can come to Australia, and freedom beckons\u201d, as a number of government frontbenchers have suggested during the past few hyperbolic days. It\u2019s come to Australia (maybe, if you meet the criteria) and get detained again. Despite the brief confirming medical transferees would continue to be detained, this is framed by the authors as a problem. \u201cPlacing up to 1000 people in held detention will put pressure on the detention network and with risk assessments, some, but not all, may be suitable for community detention. Those not suitable for community detention would be placed in held detention, likely necessitating the stand-up of the Christmas Island facility and removing our hot contingency fall back for Operation Sovereign Borders.\u201d The briefers worry word will get back to the people smugglers. \u201cThis path to Australia will likely reach people smugglers in a short period and they could rightly advise their clients that if they were sent at a future time to a regional processing location, they would only need to stay long enough to seek the recommendations of \u2018treating doctors\u2019 for transfer to Australia. \u201cWe expect that this may encourage those prospective clients of people smugglers who, to date, have not decided to travel due to the dissuasion of returns, turnbacks and regional processing. This bill removes the third pillar \u2013 regional processing\u201d. Sounds bad, but several paragraphs later, the advice becomes more hedged. After noting the softening in Australia will feed in to marketing by people smugglers, the story becomes more complicated. \u201cAlthough people smugglers may claim there has been a shift in Australian policy and entry to Australia is now possible with just the opinion of two doctors, the resumption of large-scale people smuggling to Australia will remain dependent on a shift in Potential Illegal Immigrant (PII) intent \u2014 not smuggler marketing. \u201cPIIs will probably be interested in any perceived or actual pathway where resettlement in a Western country is guaranteed, even if such a pathway includes a period spent in detention. However, PIIs will probably remain sceptical of smuggler marketing and await proof that such a pathway is viable, or that an actual change of policy has occurred, before committing to ventures.\u201d Kerryn Phelps on why she believes Labor blinked and, more importantly, why she believes everyone needs to get moving. I think you would have to speak to Labor about that, because, you know, what their motives are, you\u2019d have to ask them. But certainly I believe that there is a great willingness by many people in parliament to get a resolution to this today, or in the next few days, because, as I said, lives do depend on this. We cannot keep going the way we have been going, where the bureaucrats and the minister just block medical transfers by running them through the courts, by taking them to the federal court, only to find those ministerial decisions overturned and the doctors\u2019 decisions upheld. We need to find the right balance and the right balance is to have medical practitioners making decisions about the medical transfers because they\u2019re saying that they cannot cope on Manus Island and Nauru with particular cases. And the minister does need to have certain veto powers related to security for Australia, and if we can get the wording to everyone\u2019s satisfaction, let\u2019s do that today. Speaking to the ABC, Kerryn Phelps expanded on concerns she has about Labor\u2019s proposed amendment to broaden national security ministerial discretion to include people who have been convicted of a serious crime, when it came to the medical evacuation bill. The first thing is that these people have all been, if they\u2019ve been assessed as refugees under the refugee convention, they cannot have committed a serious crime in their home country. But we also need to look at what the definition of serious crime is, because if for example somebody has committed a crime in their country, which is a political crime, for example, complaining about something their government has done, been involved in a protest, being a human rights protester, a woman who has committed adultery who is sentenced to death by stoning \u2013 these are the sorts of things that might come under serious criminality and so we need to take a very careful look at that definition. And what I\u2019m very keen to do is to avoid being in exactly the same position where we are now, where the minister has excessive veto powers and runs every serious medical case through the courts, only to find that the doctor\u2019s original recommendations were upheld. Most of the people on Manus Island and Nauru have been judged to be refugees \u2013 not just by the UNHCR but also by Australian authorities. And given how long they have spent in our offshore detention centres, there is nothing we don\u2019t know about these people. Nothing. Mike Bowers spent the morning at St Paul\u2019s Anglican church. He sent through the message he\u2019d sent the photos, before he said good morning, if that helps you place his feelings about today. Could I also just say that this little girl is an absolute MOOD. Before all the messiness of the day begins in earnest, some good news \u2013 Hakeem al-Araibi is due to arrive in Melbourne very soon, after his almost three-month ordeal. Here is what the prime minister had to say late last night, after the decision not to pursue the extradition case: But what we\u2019d like to do tonight is to thank and show our appreciation to the Thai government for the decision that they have taken today. We greatly respect the process that they\u2019ve had to work through and we greatly appreciate their listening to the issues that have been raised by our government and many others who have raised this case. These issues are complex and our relationship with the Thai government and in particular with Prime Minister Prayut, is very strong. We thank them for the way that they have engaged with us on this matter now, for some period of time. I also want to thank \u2013 and the foreign minister will add further to this \u2013 all of those Australians who have been so supportive of Hakeem. Those who have provided direct support to him personally, particularly Craig Foster, who has very much championed his case and cause and I have spoken to him and Marise has spoken to him on many occasions, we\u2019ve worked closely together. But there is still a journey ahead, there is still a process to be followed. But we are very grateful for the relationship we have with the Thai government that has enabled us to work through these issues in the way that we have. I particularly want to commend the foreign minister for the work that she has done and that all of our consular officials have done. These issues are very delicate, they\u2019re very sensitive and I think what we\u2019ve seen here is the professionalism of our foreign service on show. So we thank them very much for all of their work and all of their advice. Welcome to the first sitting day of 2019. We begin today as we ended yesterday \u2013 talking about the Manus Island and Nauru medical evacuation bill. As Katharine Murphy reported: At the end of a meeting of the shadow cabinet, the left and right factions, and the caucus, the ALP signalled it wanted to rework the proposal it supported in the parliament last December to increase the discretion of the home affairs minister to refuse medical transfers for asylum seekers, to make the timeframes for decision making less restrictive, and to ensure the procedures only applied to the cohort currently on Manus Island and Nauru. The backflip, which had been telegraphed by Bill Shorten since the middle of last week, followed a substantial rhetorical bombardment \u2013 including misrepresentations about the detail of the legislation \u2013 by the Morrison government in an effort to avoid losing the first substantive vote in the House of Representatives since 1929. This morning, Kerryn Phelps, who was the inspiration behind the bill getting to this point, has said she will look at Labor\u2019s proposed amendments. She said her focus was on getting ill people the treatment they need. \u201cThat is what this is all about \u2013 getting medical treatment for those people who can\u2019t get medical treatment on Manus Island and Nauru,\u201d she told Sky News. \u201cSo, if the legislation is confined to that cohort, that might be something that we can look at, but I would have to again speak to the refugee sector about that.\u201d So stay tuned as we follow those developments. Both party leaders are at the traditional beginning of parliament church service this morning, before heading back to parliament where all the morning\u2019s lessons will be promptly forgotten. And we\u2019ll be here documenting it all. Mike Bowers is already out and about, as is Katharine Murphy and the rest of the Guardian\u2019s brains trust. You\u2019ll find us on Twitter and, when time permits, in the comments. I haven\u2019t found a coffee this morning, so once that is done, I will be straight back into it. Ready? Let\u2019s go.",

In separate incidents in recent days, swastikas were drawn on Paris postboxes bearing portraits of the late politician and Holocaust survivor Simone Veil. The word Juden (German for Jews) was sprayed on the window of a bagel bakery on the \u00cele Saint-Louis in the heart of the capital. The French government\u2019s special representative on racism, antisemitism and discrimination said the graffiti was sickening.

      "body": "<p>The first thing you see when you walk into the Donmar rehearsal space is a control room taking up the whole of one wall. The actor Enzo Cilenti sits behind glass issuing orders impatiently in a thick Italian accent to three of his co-stars, who are squeezed around a microphone in a smaller booth opposite; one of them, Tom Brooke, the soldier-turned-sniper from the BBC thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/bodyguard--episode-by-episode\">Bodyguard</a>, looks as amusingly bewildered as Beaker from The Muppet Show. Props strewn around the room include an axe, a Tom and Jerry music box and a cabbage with a knife lodged in it. Someone is looking for a misplaced electric toothbrush, though this turns out to be a matter of sound effects rather than dental hygiene. An engineer says, \u201cLet\u2019s put some reverb on that,\u201d while two men relax in chairs nearby. They are wearing caretaker coats and high heels.</p> <p>Picking his way through this scene in tracksuit bottoms, T-shirt and socks is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/ng-interactive/2016/jan/27/stage-designs-kanye-west-tom-scutt-mr-burns-constellations-king-charles-iii-donmar-vmas\">Tom Scutt</a>, an acclaimed stage designer who has also worked as creative director for Christine and the Queens. Scutt is making his directing debut on this theatrical version of Peter Strickland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/30/berberian-sound-studio-review\">chilling 2012 film Berberian Sound Studio</a>, about a timid analogue recordist named Gilderoy (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/toby-jones\">Toby Jones</a> on screen, Brooke in this version) who travels to Italy in the mid-1970s to record foley for a <em>giallo \u2013 </em>one of those florid, operatic chillers where the deaths are almost as painful as the dialogue. Only one cast member, Strickland\u2019s regular collaborator Eugenia Caruso, appears in both play and movie, though she hasn\u2019t brought any reminiscences to the rehearsal room. \u201cThere are so many deviations from the film, it would be irrelevant,\u201d explains the writer, Joel Horwood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5bf8189be3814e6f1e53913b192ce6ea956d418\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5bf8189be3814e6f1e53913b192ce6ea956d418/0_0_2000_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The poster for Peter Strickland\u2019s 2012 film.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The poster for Peter Strickland\u2019s 2012 film.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Artificial Eye</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Strickland always saw his movie not as horror but as a workplace drama about office politics, and Scutt and Horwood are equally keen to give the h-word a swerve. The in-house DVD library may be heavy on <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000783/\">Dario Argento</a> (Suspiria, Tenebrae) but cast and crew can also borrow the documentary Notes on Blindness, or audio-centric thrillers including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/apr/22/my-favourite-cannes-winner-the-conversation\">The Conversation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/09/blow-out-classic-dvd-review\">Blow Out</a>, and the play itself will be accessible to even the greenest <em>giallo</em>-come-lately. Ask Scutt about its influences and it\u2019s like turning on a tap full blast. \u201cWe\u2019ve discussed Buster Keaton and the Marx Brothers, Yorgos Lanthimos and The Archers,\u201d he says. Inevitably for a story steeped in analogue recordings, there are echoes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/08/krapps-last-tape-barry-mcgovern-edinburgh-samuel-beckett-harold-pinter-john-hurt\">Krapp\u2019s Last Tape</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s Carry On Beckett!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We've never thought of having to scare people. There are horrific ideas \u2026 It relies on the audience's imagination</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never thought of having to scare people,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s more about a subliminal atmosphere that permeates the characters\u2019 relationships. There are horrific ideas but it\u2019s deliberately not a gorefest. It relies entirely on the audience\u2019s imagination. You don\u2019t see the film Gilderoy\u2019s working on, and the idea of a piece of theatre where everyone is watching content being made is very interesting. It\u2019s like we\u2019re seeing the wrong bit of the product.\u201d So it\u2019s like a sinister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/dec/14/noises-off-review\">Noises Off</a>? \u201cYes, there\u2019s that element of farce, too. Booths where people can only hear when they\u2019re plugged in, or can\u2019t see each other. Some characters speak only Italian, Gilderoy only English. It\u2019s about failures of communication in power hierarchies and across gender and language.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t that Scutt went looking for contemporary resonances, more that the play attracted them like knives to a magnet. \u201cI originally wanted to do the show because I was interested in using sound viscerally on stage. Having a sub-bass hitting you in the chest \u2013 it\u2019s more like a gig than straight theatre. But then Brexit happened and I thought: \u2018Oh, this is about being a Brit in a European country.\u2019 And obviously Trump and Weinstein added all this extra relevance to the play\u2019s story of gendered violence. It just sort of kept rolling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"552e2cfb66dedc08aca8823aca9e550eabc75f7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/552e2cfb66dedc08aca8823aca9e550eabc75f7c/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Brooke and Tom Espiner make sound effects.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creepy \u2026 Tom Brooke and Tom Espiner make sound effects.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The villain of the piece is Santini (Luke Pasqualino), the film director who manipulates and terrorises those beneath him, especially women. \u201cIt feels like the right thing to be discussing at this political moment,\u201d explains Horwood. \u201cHow and why we make work, why we tell certain stories, what they represent and who gets to be in charge of them.\u201d Scutt gestures to the set behind us: \u201cI mean, look at this: these isolated booths where a man can control the faders on a woman\u2019s voice. It\u2019s exactly where we are in the world at the moment. This is a landscape where women\u2019s voices are harvested and used by men but their actual opinions and feelings are of no interest.\u201d</p> <p>Back in rehearsal, the lights are now tinted red.

      "bodyText": "The first thing you see when you walk into the Donmar rehearsal space is a control room taking up the whole of one wall. The actor Enzo Cilenti sits behind glass issuing orders impatiently in a thick Italian accent to three of his co-stars, who are squeezed around a microphone in a smaller booth opposite; one of them, Tom Brooke, the soldier-turned-sniper from the BBC thriller Bodyguard, looks as amusingly bewildered as Beaker from The Muppet Show. Props strewn around the room include an axe, a Tom and Jerry music box and a cabbage with a knife lodged in it. Someone is looking for a misplaced electric toothbrush, though this turns out to be a matter of sound effects rather than dental hygiene. An engineer says, \u201cLet\u2019s put some reverb on that,\u201d while two men relax in chairs nearby. They are wearing caretaker coats and high heels. Picking his way through this scene in tracksuit bottoms, T-shirt and socks is Tom Scutt, an acclaimed stage designer who has also worked as creative director for Christine and the Queens. Scutt is making his directing debut on this theatrical version of Peter Strickland\u2019s chilling 2012 film Berberian Sound Studio, about a timid analogue recordist named Gilderoy (Toby Jones on screen, Brooke in this version) who travels to Italy in the mid-1970s to record foley for a giallo \u2013 one of those florid, operatic chillers where the deaths are almost as painful as the dialogue. Only one cast member, Strickland\u2019s regular collaborator Eugenia Caruso, appears in both play and movie, though she hasn\u2019t brought any reminiscences to the rehearsal room. \u201cThere are so many deviations from the film, it would be irrelevant,\u201d explains the writer, Joel Horwood. Strickland always saw his movie not as horror but as a workplace drama about office politics, and Scutt and Horwood are equally keen to give the h-word a swerve. The in-house DVD library may be heavy on Dario Argento (Suspiria, Tenebrae) but cast and crew can also borrow the documentary Notes on Blindness, or audio-centric thrillers including The Conversation and Blow Out, and the play itself will be accessible to even the greenest giallo-come-lately. Ask Scutt about its influences and it\u2019s like turning on a tap full blast. \u201cWe\u2019ve discussed Buster Keaton and the Marx Brothers, Yorgos Lanthimos and The Archers,\u201d he says. Inevitably for a story steeped in analogue recordings, there are echoes of Krapp\u2019s Last Tape. \u201cIt\u2019s Carry On Beckett!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve never thought of having to scare people,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s more about a subliminal atmosphere that permeates the characters\u2019 relationships. There are horrific ideas but it\u2019s deliberately not a gorefest. It relies entirely on the audience\u2019s imagination. You don\u2019t see the film Gilderoy\u2019s working on, and the idea of a piece of theatre where everyone is watching content being made is very interesting. It\u2019s like we\u2019re seeing the wrong bit of the product.\u201d So it\u2019s like a sinister Noises Off? \u201cYes, there\u2019s that element of farce, too. Booths where people can only hear when they\u2019re plugged in, or can\u2019t see each other. Some characters speak only Italian, Gilderoy only English. It\u2019s about failures of communication in power hierarchies and across gender and language.\u201d It wasn\u2019t that Scutt went looking for contemporary resonances, more that the play attracted them like knives to a magnet. \u201cI originally wanted to do the show because I was interested in using sound viscerally on stage. Having a sub-bass hitting you in the chest \u2013 it\u2019s more like a gig than straight theatre. But then Brexit happened and I thought: \u2018Oh, this is about being a Brit in a European country.\u2019 And obviously Trump and Weinstein added all this extra relevance to the play\u2019s story of gendered violence. It just sort of kept rolling.\u201d The villain of the piece is Santini (Luke Pasqualino), the film director who manipulates and terrorises those beneath him, especially women. \u201cIt feels like the right thing to be discussing at this political moment,\u201d explains Horwood. \u201cHow and why we make work, why we tell certain stories, what they represent and who gets to be in charge of them.\u201d Scutt gestures to the set behind us: \u201cI mean, look at this: these isolated booths where a man can control the faders on a woman\u2019s voice. It\u2019s exactly where we are in the world at the moment. This is a landscape where women\u2019s voices are harvested and used by men but their actual opinions and feelings are of no interest.\u201d Back in rehearsal, the lights are now tinted red. Brooke walks over to a table and performs a series of ritualistic actions: removing the knife from the cabbage, he stabs the vegetable again before placing a metal pitcher over a spinning top. The two high-heeled caretakers \u2013 Hemi Yeroham and Tom Espiner (who doubles as the production\u2019s foley designer) \u2013 are now in the vocal booth, buzzing the toothbrush inside a metal container and winding the music box in excruciating slow-motion.

The Treasury is very good at control. It tells departments what they get and delivers the totals.

He wants it to look at the whole picture, from decisions about tax and spending programmes through to people\u2019s everyday encounters with employment and benefit services, schools, clinics, policing and care.

Yet there are huge gaps in the data and in our understanding of what public spending actually buys.

Amid plummeting regard for Westminster and Whitehall, the NAO\u2019s reputation for rigour and honesty has never been higher. Yet its mission is fuzzy and there are large gaps. The NAO does the technical audit of government departments, but audit in councils and the NHS is done by private firms and not properly regulated. In recent years, the NAO has expanded its value-for-money studies, but no one looks at outcomes and outputs in local authorities or NHS trusts in any detail. No one compares and contrasts how money is spent and audited in England against Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which have separate accounts offices.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/20/society-weekly-email-newsletter-sign-up\">Sign up for Society Weekly: our newsletter for public service professionals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maybe the NAO should be repurposed.

      "bodyText": "There are few upsides to Brexit, but one rare positive has been a heightened awareness about unfairness, especially between different places around the UK. A recent Centre for Cities report showed just how much northern cities, in particular, have been clobbered by austerity. The Key Cities group of 24 councils in England and Wales has joined the special interest group of mainly Labour and northern metropolitan authorities led by Barnsley\u2019s Steve Houghton in calling for a fairer grants regime and economic rebalancing. Together the two groups represent urban areas where a quarter of the English population live. They have already made strenuous representations against the unfairness of this year\u2019s funding settlement for local government, pointing out that \u201cthe most deprived areas have been forced to cut up to 10 times deeper than the most affluent\u201d. The groups\u2019 demands, as well as the Commons public accounts committee\u2019s report on the unsustainability of local government finance, highlight what\u2019s missing in how the government accounts for public spending. While auditors are despatched to sniff out economy, efficiency and effectiveness, they miss the vital element: equity. This spring should see a government spending review, to set the shape of public services into the 2020s. But this looks like becoming another casualty of Brexit, with uncertainty around when the review will take place and what spending it will cover. How can you make a plan when the prime minister is making big spending commitments on the hoof and the economy and public revenues face meltdown? But on past form, a Treasury-led spending review would, in any case, be deeply flawed. The Treasury is very good at control. It tells departments what they get and delivers the totals. But it is bad at ensuring the money is well spent, that it secures outcomes and does what ministers claim. Universal credit, to take just one policy, is a gigantic blot on the Treasury\u2019s recent record. Lord Kerslake, former head of the civil service and former chief executive of Sheffield city council, says the Treasury needs to be more strategic. He wants it to look at the whole picture, from decisions about tax and spending programmes through to people\u2019s everyday encounters with employment and benefit services, schools, clinics, policing and care. Spending should include appraising how projects are managed, how much contractors will get and, critically, who will benefit and where the money will end up. In a report for the Smith Institute John Tizard and I make the case for a radical overhaul of how we account for spending, before and after it is committed, and argue that it is opponents of austerity and advocates of higher spending who should be most clamorous for a tougher audit. Ensuring spending on benefits, health, care and infrastructure is effective and changes people\u2019s lives for the better is at the heart of politics. Yet there are huge gaps in the data and in our understanding of what public spending actually buys. Getting value for money has too often been left to bean counters, which explains why the critical issue of equity \u2013 ensuring public budgets are fairly distributed \u2013 has been ignored. Later this year, Gareth Davies takes over from Amyas Morse as head of the National Audit Office, making it a good time to reflect on the future of that esteemed outfit. Amid plummeting regard for Westminster and Whitehall, the NAO\u2019s reputation for rigour and honesty has never been higher. Yet its mission is fuzzy and there are large gaps. The NAO does the technical audit of government departments, but audit in councils and the NHS is done by private firms and not properly regulated. In recent years, the NAO has expanded its value-for-money studies, but no one looks at outcomes and outputs in local authorities or NHS trusts in any detail. No one compares and contrasts how money is spent and audited in England against Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which have separate accounts offices. Maybe the NAO should be repurposed. It could take responsibility for and tighten standards in the technical audit of councils and NHS trusts as well as Whitehall. Its value-for-money work, which goes far beyond accountancy, should be assigned to a new Office of the 3Es \u2013 equity, efficiency and effectiveness \u2013 which would join up the work of the various inspectorates, such as the Care Quality Commission, with value-for-money analysis across the whole public sector. Public money will always be scarce and precious. We need to raise more of it in tax \u2013 look at the array of problems facing the UK whatever happens to Brexit. The likelihood of voters agreeing to higher tax depends on persuading them that public bodies can manage and account for public money better and more fairly. \u2022 Spending fairly, spending well: time for a radical overhaul of value for money and public audit, published by the Smith Institute on 12 February.",

      "bodyText": "Activists have called on the Queensland government to investigate after mining company Adani confirmed that contaminated water released into the Caley Valley wetlands during last week\u2019s Queensland floods occurred at almost twice the rate it is licensed for. The company issued a statement on Tuesday to say investigations at Abbot Point had concluded the flood waters did not enter the Great Barrier Reef marine park area. But polluted water had entered the wetlands from an authorised release point at elevated levels it said were \u201cminor\u201d. The company said flood water released into the wetlands was sent for an analysis that found the volume of total suspended solids and debris material \u2013 such as soil, plant, dust and other pollutants \u2013 was 58 mg/L. Adani is licensed to release water containing a maximum of 30 mg/L in contaminants. \u201cThis is a very minor elevation in total suspended solids, following an extraordinary weather event that caused flooding and damage to much of North Queensland including many homes, businesses, and farms,\u201d said Dwayne Freeman, the chief executive of Abbot Point Operations. \u201cWe are confident there will be no environmental impacts to the wetlands area, despite this unprecedented weather event.\u201d He said the company would not normally release its test results but it recognised there was a high level of interest in the operations at Abbot Point terminal and it wanted \u201cto keep the community informed and to demonstrate our commitment to operating transparently and with integrity\u201d. It would be the second breach of Adani\u2019s licence requirements at the site and activists called on the Queensland government to prosecute. The Queensland government took legal action against Adani last year for breaching an amended licence for the release of polluted water during cyclone Debbie in 2017. Peter McCallum, the coordinator of the Mackay Conservation Group, said the levels measured were almost twice what was allowed under Adani\u2019s licence. \u201cWe believe that the government should, once it gathers the evidence, prosecute the company for this second breach of their licence at this site,\u201d he said. The Australian Marine Conservation Society said it was the second time in two years that Adani had exceeded its pollution limits in the wetlands area. \u201cThis second breach in only two years shows Adani has again failed to comply with its legal obligations to protect the environment,\u201d said Lissa Schindler, the AMCS\u2019s reef campaigner. \u201cInstead of running an advertising blitz to pressure the Queensland government into approving its reef-wrecking project, Adani should have been ensuring its port was able to cope with Queensland\u2019s extreme weather events.\u201d The department of environment and science said Adani had not applied for a temporary emissions licence to increase the amount of pollutants it could release. A spokesperson said the department had also conducted its own tests at the site last week and was awaiting results from an analysis of water samples. \u201cDES will consider the results from the laboratory analysis along with other information in relation to the release event before making any determination as to whether or not the company has complied with the environmental authority conditions for the site,\u201d the spokesperson said. Adani has been contacted for comment.",

Orb\u00e1n\u2019s actions and words on migration, speaking of a threat to \u201cChristian culture\u201d and building a fence along the country\u2019s border, are similar to much of Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric, and state department officials have also said engagement is necessary to counter the growing influence of Russia and China in the region.

Despite this, Cornstein\u2019s requests to the Hungarian government to keep open the Central European University, an English-language institution founded by George Soros that has come under fire from Orb\u00e1n, were ignored. The university is gradually moving to Vienna after being refused accreditation by Hungarian authorities. This has led some to question whether engagement was the right approach. A leaked Hungarian diplomatic cable from December, published by the investigative website direkt36, suggested there was frustration in Washington over Hungarian intransigence on several issues considered as key to US interests. During his visit, Pompeo made progress on the signing of a new defence cooperation agreement between the US and Hungary, which has long been stalled. Despite the focus on engagement, Pompeo also met civil society groups in Budapest, including those targeted by the Hungarian government for providing legal assistance to refugees attempting to enter the country.

This image \u2013 of an invisible literature that permeates the collective consciousness \u2013 becomes literal reality in <em>The Freedom Artist</em> \u2013 inasmuch as anything in a magic realist world can be described as literal.</p> <p>One narrative thread is set in a society similar to our own, but in a world from which books have disappeared: \u201cGradually people stopped reading. Even the machines invented to make reading easier and portable fell into disuse\u2026 People simply stopped reading the ancient classics. Then they couldn\u2019t read anything that required a little thought. Then they couldn\u2019t read anything but the simplest books. Then all they read were newspapers of the popular variety.

      "bodyText": "The notion of the human condition as a prison or a dream state runs through western literature, from Plato through to Boethius, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Calder\u00f3n de la Barca and all the way to Kafka, Camus, Borges and plenty more. Ben Okri\u2019s 11th novel, The Freedom Artist, invokes all these preceding stories in a multilayered allegorical narrative that cuts to the heart of our current political and cultural malaise, while maintaining a mythical, mesmeric flavour that makes the reader feel these are stories they have always known. In a 2018 interview with the Guardian, Okri described his life project as trying to do something new with \u201cthat great oceanic tide of African fables and stories that I grew up on \u2013 what I call the vast invisible literature\u201d. This image \u2013 of an invisible literature that permeates the collective consciousness \u2013 becomes literal reality in The Freedom Artist \u2013 inasmuch as anything in a magic realist world can be described as literal. One narrative thread is set in a society similar to our own, but in a world from which books have disappeared: \u201cGradually people stopped reading. Even the machines invented to make reading easier and portable fell into disuse\u2026 People simply stopped reading the ancient classics. Then they couldn\u2019t read anything that required a little thought. Then they couldn\u2019t read anything but the simplest books. Then all they read were newspapers of the popular variety. Literacy vanished from the world, along with bookshops.\u201d This could sound like a rather heavy-handed satire on the state of literary culture from a writer who is now part of its old guard, but in the context of the story, such a recognisable erosion of reading and independent thought is chilling. \u201cStorytellers sometimes see things before they have been experienced,\u201d the novel tells us, darkly. In this Orwellian society in which myths are rewritten, questions forbidden and questioners disappeared, there are those who preserve the old stories in secret. One such is the unnamed father of a girl called Ruslana, a Prospero-like figure who has shut himself away with a basement full of books that he turns into holograms before they are destroyed.

      "bodyText": "I bought a TV from John Lewis in March 2015. It came with an extended five-year guarantee, which I topped up with the store\u2019s accidental damage cover. Last November, the TV developed a fault. John Lewis attempted to fix it but, when it couldn\u2019t, it offered a full refund for both the TV and the added cover \u2013 a total of \u00a3418. I thought this was amazing and had so much faith in John Lewis that I purchased a replacement instantly and assumed that the refund would be processed before Christmas. It is now more than nine weeks later and I\u2019ve still received nothing. I\u2019ve contacted the company so many times via online chat, email and over the phone, but I\u2019m getting nowhere. AM, Hayes We have been getting a few letters recently bemoaning an alleged lack of customer care at John Lewis and, in particular, its inability to call customers back as promised. A decade ago this would have been unheard of. Happily, a call to John Lewis\u2019s HQ has got things moving, and your refund is on its way which it has rounded up to \u00a3500. It says it is \u201cvery sorry for the delay and the unnecessary inconvenience caused\u201d. In August, John Lewis said it was ending a contract with Capita to run some of its call centres, and was taking its customer services all back in-house. We reported in 2015 that this was not going well. What possessed the store to outsource it in the first place? We welcome letters but cannot answer individually. Email us at consumer.champions@theguardian.com or write to Consumer Champions, Money, the Guardian, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU. Please include a daytime phone number. Submission and publication of all letters is subject to terms and conditions",

Intensively raised livestock is given specialised feeds, including soy and wheat, that fatten them up faster, rather than by grazing on grasslands.</p> <p>This land, and other targeted subsidies for livestock, is worth between \u20ac28-\u20ac32bn (\u00a324-\u00a327.9bn) in CAP direct payments per year for the animal farming sector, 18-20% of the EU\u2019s total budget.</p> <p>Instead of the intensive model of grain-fed livestock, the campaigners argue that meat and dairy production should be restricted to grass-based systems, where the animals are reared outdoors and fed a largely grass-based diet. This would free up large amounts of land to growing crops directly for human consumption.</p> <p>\u201cIf Europe produced and consumed exclusively grass-fed livestock, we\u2019d be a long way towards producing and consuming less and better meat and dairy in line with what science tells us is necessary to protect nature, the climate and our health,\u201d said Contiero.</p> <p>However other groups argue that intensively reared livestock is less carbon intensive than grass-fed meat, because it uses less land.</p> <p>Greenpeace said that EU farm subsidies should be redirected towards incentivising more fruit and vegetable production.</p> <p>The consumption of animal protein in Europe has increased by 80% since the 1960s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/15/europe-meat-dairy-production-2050-expert-warns\">driven by an increase</a> in meat and dairy production in the region. Globally, livestock is using almost 80% of the world\u2019s farmland, yet <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987\">delivering just 18% of our calories</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIn the long run it makes increasingly less sense to incentivise production that creates more costly impacts to society than economic benefits,\u201d said Professor Tim Benton, the UK\u2019s former \u201cfood security champion\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFarmers are not the \u2018bad guys\u2019 in a simplistic story: they are trapped in a system that rewards producing more at the expense of wider social costs arising from environmental and health impacts,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Pasture-Fed Livestock Association said the research had clearly identified that environmental damage does not arise from livestock per se, but as a result of the way in which some animals are reared.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is the intensification of livestock production across Europe made possible through feeding grains to animals. Such practices have resulted in fewer small mixed farms and more specialised farms and monoculture production systems \u2013 along with a corresponding increase in fossil fuel consumption, nitrate fertiliser production, air and water pollution [and] loss of biodiversity,\u201d said the executive secretary, Russ Carrington.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nearly a fifth of the EU\u2019s total budget \u2013 more than \u00a324bn of taxpayer money \u2013 goes to support livestock farming across Europe, according to new research by Greenpeace. At a time when scientists are calling for significant reductions in meat consumption, the report\u2019s authors say taxpayers\u2019 money should be redirected away from grain-fed, industrial animal farming. Last month, the Eat-Lancet Commission of scientists called for a new plant-focused diet to help avoid dangerous levels of climate change and the destruction of wildlife. Such a diet would require cutting red meat consumption in Europe by 77%. Public Health England\u2019s dietary guidelines recommend that meat and dairy, including non-animal-based protein alternatives such as beans and pulses, should make up no more than our 20% of dietary intake. Yet, Europeans eat more than twice as much meat as national dietary authorities recommend, as well as twice the global average. \u201cAdopting diets lower in meat and dairy would not only tackle health problems but would also reduce the pressure on land, freeing up more space for nature,\u201d said the Greenpeace EU agriculture policy director Marco Contiero. Researchers from Greenpeace used publicly available data from the European Commission and Eurostat to estimate farm subsidies and land tied to rearing livestock. Researchers calculated that 125 million hectares (308 million acres) of land in Europe is used to graze livestock or produce feed \u2013 this includes more than 60% of arable land that could otherwise be used to grow food directly for human consumption. Intensively raised livestock is given specialised feeds, including soy and wheat, that fatten them up faster, rather than by grazing on grasslands. This land, and other targeted subsidies for livestock, is worth between \u20ac28-\u20ac32bn (\u00a324-\u00a327.9bn) in CAP direct payments per year for the animal farming sector, 18-20% of the EU\u2019s total budget. Instead of the intensive model of grain-fed livestock, the campaigners argue that meat and dairy production should be restricted to grass-based systems, where the animals are reared outdoors and fed a largely grass-based diet. This would free up large amounts of land to growing crops directly for human consumption. \u201cIf Europe produced and consumed exclusively grass-fed livestock, we\u2019d be a long way towards producing and consuming less and better meat and dairy in line with what science tells us is necessary to protect nature, the climate and our health,\u201d said Contiero. However other groups argue that intensively reared livestock is less carbon intensive than grass-fed meat, because it uses less land. Greenpeace said that EU farm subsidies should be redirected towards incentivising more fruit and vegetable production. The consumption of animal protein in Europe has increased by 80% since the 1960s, driven by an increase in meat and dairy production in the region. Globally, livestock is using almost 80% of the world\u2019s farmland, yet delivering just 18% of our calories. \u201cIn the long run it makes increasingly less sense to incentivise production that creates more costly impacts to society than economic benefits,\u201d said Professor Tim Benton, the UK\u2019s former \u201cfood security champion\u201d. \u201cFarmers are not the \u2018bad guys\u2019 in a simplistic story: they are trapped in a system that rewards producing more at the expense of wider social costs arising from environmental and health impacts,\u201d he said. The Pasture-Fed Livestock Association said the research had clearly identified that environmental damage does not arise from livestock per se, but as a result of the way in which some animals are reared. \u201cThe problem is the intensification of livestock production across Europe made possible through feeding grains to animals. Such practices have resulted in fewer small mixed farms and more specialised farms and monoculture production systems \u2013 along with a corresponding increase in fossil fuel consumption, nitrate fertiliser production, air and water pollution [and] loss of biodiversity,\u201d said the executive secretary, Russ Carrington.",

For most academics and students the idea of making progress is about putting in the hard work and experiencing the frustration of getting most things wrong, most of the time. Almost everyone you talk to claims to have imposter syndrome, feeling that somehow they got their place or position as a result of clerical error. In the rare cases where they don\u2019t, they probably ought to.</p> <p>It\u2019s the pursuit of excellence, not happiness, that is built into every university mission statement. But what do we mean by excellence? The philosopher Harry Frankfurt begins a paper on equality with a joke. \u201cFirst man: how are your children? Second man: compared to what?\u201d And here, I think, he has put his finger on our problem.</p> <p>One kind of parent wants their children to reach their potential by developing their talents, forming strong relationships, achieving valuable goals, and having a satisfying life \u2013 excellence as flourishing. Another kind wants their children to come top of their class, and captain the team \u2013 excellence as winning. Universities talk the language of flourishing but a variety of league tables force us into competition. Our excellence is comparative.</p> <p>And what exactly is the point of pushing universities to compete with each other? To keep us sharp and on our toes, no doubt. To drive up quality, innovation, and variety of supply. But competition can have other effects, too. Karl Marx points out that the natural logic of competition is that someone wins. The Research Excellence Framework accelerates this process by rewarding the winners with the resources to do even better next time. This can leave others struggling to keep up, and, rather than innovating, they may try to ape the strategies that have been successful for those at the top. We see this in teaching, too, where university after university is shrinking the supply of lower-demand subjects, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/oct/08/modern-foreign-language-degrees-axed\" title=\"\">languages</a>, and aiming to boost market share by copying successful programmes elsewhere, especially those that, for the moment, have the highest earning potential.</p> <p>Unlike free-market ideologues, economic regulators know that a competitive system is a delicate ecosystem, and to get its benefits loving care and attention are necessary. Otherwise, the relentless search for profits means every high street looks the same, with small, quirky shops driven out, and one retailer scooping up every online purchase. It is hard to set up a competitive system that rewards difference, and makes room for genuine innovation at all levels. In the HE sector at the moment it is hard to tell if we are even trying.</p> <p>Although Sidgwick believed that individuals seek both happiness and excellence, eventually he reveals that he regards the pursuit of excellence as irrational unless it leads to a greater total of happiness in the world. Too bad he isn\u2019t around to work out whether we have this right in the HE sector today.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Jonathan Wolff is professor of social policy at the Blavatnik </em><em>School of </em><em>Government, Oxford</em></p>",

Still, if you wanted to be happy you might do better to keep clear of the higher education sector. For most academics and students the idea of making progress is about putting in the hard work and experiencing the frustration of getting most things wrong, most of the time. Almost everyone you talk to claims to have imposter syndrome, feeling that somehow they got their place or position as a result of clerical error. In the rare cases where they don\u2019t, they probably ought to. It\u2019s the pursuit of excellence, not happiness, that is built into every university mission statement. But what do we mean by excellence? The philosopher Harry Frankfurt begins a paper on equality with a joke. \u201cFirst man: how are your children? Second man: compared to what?\u201d And here, I think, he has put his finger on our problem. One kind of parent wants their children to reach their potential by developing their talents, forming strong relationships, achieving valuable goals, and having a satisfying life \u2013 excellence as flourishing. Another kind wants their children to come top of their class, and captain the team \u2013 excellence as winning. Universities talk the language of flourishing but a variety of league tables force us into competition. Our excellence is comparative. And what exactly is the point of pushing universities to compete with each other? To keep us sharp and on our toes, no doubt. To drive up quality, innovation, and variety of supply. But competition can have other effects, too. Karl Marx points out that the natural logic of competition is that someone wins. The Research Excellence Framework accelerates this process by rewarding the winners with the resources to do even better next time. This can leave others struggling to keep up, and, rather than innovating, they may try to ape the strategies that have been successful for those at the top. We see this in teaching, too, where university after university is shrinking the supply of lower-demand subjects, such as languages, and aiming to boost market share by copying successful programmes elsewhere, especially those that, for the moment, have the highest earning potential. Unlike free-market ideologues, economic regulators know that a competitive system is a delicate ecosystem, and to get its benefits loving care and attention are necessary. Otherwise, the relentless search for profits means every high street looks the same, with small, quirky shops driven out, and one retailer scooping up every online purchase. It is hard to set up a competitive system that rewards difference, and makes room for genuine innovation at all levels. In the HE sector at the moment it is hard to tell if we are even trying. Although Sidgwick believed that individuals seek both happiness and excellence, eventually he reveals that he regards the pursuit of excellence as irrational unless it leads to a greater total of happiness in the world. Too bad he isn\u2019t around to work out whether we have this right in the HE sector today. \u2022 Jonathan Wolff is professor of social policy at the Blavatnik School of Government, Oxford",

Those who died by the end of the study were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/11/study-links-heavily-processed-foods-to-risk-of-earlier-death\">likely to have eaten a greater amount of ultra-processed food</a>, the researchers found. Commenting on the study, Nita Forouhi, a professor of epidemiology at Cambridge, said such foods tended to be eaten disproportionately by poorer people: \u201cThey tend to be cheaper, are highly palatable due to high sugar, salt and saturated fat content, are widely available, highly marketed, ready to eat, and their use-by dates are lengthy, so they last longer.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018It is time Britain left now\u2019 Hello, it\u2019s Warren Murray, and I would like to draw your attention to the following matters. \u201cIt\u2019s a mixture of bemusement and bewilderment \u2026 a pantomime you can\u2019t stop watching,\u201d says Michiel van Hulten, a Dutch former member of the European parliament. \u201cA national psychodrama,\u201d is how one French commentator puts it. \u201cI think it is time Britain left now,\u201d says a German professor. Today seven of our correspondents report on how Brexit upheaval has affected Britain\u2019s image on the continent. Back home, official figures confirm the UK has suffered its worst year for GDP growth since 2012 \u2013 debunking the chancellor\u2019s claim that Britain can reap an economic dividend if MPs vote for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. The economy grew by just 0.2% in the final three months of 2018, down from 0.6% in the third quarter. For 2018 as a whole, GDP growth slipped to its lowest since 2012, at 1.4%, down from 1.8% in 2017. As the Brexit deadline nears, car makers are stockpiling parts, banks have moved employees to Ireland and continental Europe, and Panasonic and Sony have moved their EU headquarters to mainland Europe. May hopes to convince the House of Commons today to give her another fortnight\u2019s grace to keep pushing for changes to the Irish backstop \u2013 despite the insistence of Michel Barnier that it is Britain that must compromise. In Spain, farmers of polytunnel-grown strawberries are worried that Brexit will spoil access to the British market, which takes 15% of their fruit. * * * Trump and Beto hold duelling rallies \u2013 While party leaders worked last night to reach an in-principle deal on averting another damaging US government shutdown, Donald Trump held a pep rally for himself in El Paso. The president insisted a border wall had made the Texan city safer (local politicians disagree) and boasted that despite the shutdown being staved off, \u201cjust so you know, we\u2019re building the wall anyway\u201d. Beto O\u2019Rourke addressed a counter-rally in El Paso before Trump spoke. The former congressman and Senate hopeful in the 2018 midterms told a lively crowd that \u201cwalls do not make us safer\u201d. * * * Separatist trial to begin in Spain \u2013 The trial of 12 Catalan separatist leaders is due to begin in Madrid today. It stems from the unilateral referendum on independence that was held in autumn 2017 by the Catalan regional government, in defiance of Spain\u2019s national government and the courts. Spain\u2019s ambassador to London, Carlos Bastarreche, has said in a rare public intervention that the trial is not political and the proceedings are of \u201cparamount importance to Spain\u2019s reputation as a modern democracy\u201d. The Catalan government has embarked on a vigorous diplomatic and PR campaign to portray the proceedings as a show trial. Nine of those on trial are accused of rebellion while those on the most serious charges could face up to 25 years in jail. * * * Tehran vs Trump in war of words \u2013 Iran and the United States have hurled epithets at each other on the 40th anniversary of the Islamic republic. Cries of \u201cDeath to America\u201d rang out in Tehran while President Hassan Rouhani called Donald Trump an \u201cidiot\u201d and defied calls for a fresh agreement to curb Iran\u2019s missile programme: \u201cWe have not, and will not, request permission from anyone for increasing our defensive power and for building all kinds of \u2026 missiles.\u201d Trump tweeted that Iran could only mark \u201c40 years of failure \u2026 The long-suffering Iranian people deserve a much brighter future.\u201d The Israeli PM reacted to an Iranian Revolutionary Guard threat to \u201craze\u201d Israeli cities if the US attacked Iran. \u201cIt would mean that they had celebrated their last Revolution Day,\u201d said Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cThey would do well to take that into account.\u201d * * * Vane power \u2013 A windfarm off the Yorkshire coast that will eventually be the world\u2019s largest is to supply its first power to the UK electricity grid this week. Hornsea One is planned to cover 407 sq km, five times the size of the nearby city of Hull, with 174 turbines providing 1.2GW of capacity \u2013 enough to power a million homes. It is due to be completed in the second half of this year by Danish developer \u00d8rsted. About half of the components for the project are made in the UK, in places like Hull, Teeside and Campbeltown in the Scottish highlands. The UK has enough wind and shallow enough seabeds to \u201cpower most of Europe\u201d, says Henrik Poulsen, \u00d8rsted CEO. On a lesser scale, new windfarms could make up for cancelled UK nuclear power stations. * * * Something to process \u2013 More than half the UK diet is ultra-processed food that, according to researchers, is linked to risk of premature death. A study followed 44,000 people for seven years, monitoring how much of their diet came from foods made in factories with industrial ingredients and additives, such as dried ready meals, cakes and biscuits. Those who died by the end of the study were likely to have eaten a greater amount of ultra-processed food, the researchers found. Commenting on the study, Nita Forouhi, a professor of epidemiology at Cambridge, said such foods tended to be eaten disproportionately by poorer people: \u201cThey tend to be cheaper, are highly palatable due to high sugar, salt and saturated fat content, are widely available, highly marketed, ready to eat, and their use-by dates are lengthy, so they last longer. More needs to be done to address these inequalities.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: My week at Guant\u00e1namo Bay The Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger recently attended the 33rd pre-trial hearing of five 9/11 suspects. He discusses why arguably the most important criminal trial in American history has still not begun. And: Damian Carrington on the catastrophic decline of insects. Lunchtime read: Climate change and the collapse of everything Human-caused threats to climate, nature and economy pose a danger of systemic collapse comparable to the 2008 financial crisis, according to a new report that calls for urgent and radical reform to protect political and social systems.

The meta-study compiled by the IPPR thinktank shows that since 2005, the number of floods has increased by a factor of 15, extreme temperature events by a factor of 20, and wildfires sevenfold; topsoil is now being lost 10 to 40 times faster than it is being replenished by natural processes; the 20 warmest years since records began in 1850 have been in the past 22 years; vertebrate populations have fallen by an average of 60% since the 1970s; and insect numbers \u2013 vital for pollination \u2013 have declined even faster in some countries.

Last week the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa) put out of a call for the owner of a USB stick they had recovered from the scat of a leopard seal, which had sat in a scientist\u2019s freezer for more than a year, waiting to be examined. The USB stick was functional and revealed footage of an unidentified person in a blue kayak filming two sea lion pups on the southland coast on the South Island. That person was Amanda Nally, the only sea lion volunteer on the entire south coast, who spotted the footage on the nightly news and immediately recognised it. In a strange twist, Nally was the good Samaritan who phoned the leopard seal hotline in December 2017, reporting that she had found an animal on Oreti Beach looking thin. A vet was dispatched to examine the animal, which is usually found in Antarctic waters. While the seal was being checked over Nally spotted an intact scat, and suggested it be sent to Niwa for analysis. Leopard seal faeces is valuable to scientists because it holds a wealth of information about what the Antarctic predators eat, their general health and how long they have been in New Zealand waters. The leopard seal was deemed in reasonable health, and the scat was dispatched north by courier. Unbeknown to Nally, it concealed her lost USB stick. Nally initially thought she must have dropped the device while examining the leopard seal, but Niwa scientists are convinced the tale is even stranger, and more unlikely. \u201cThe USB stick was embedded deep in the poo. Niwa are convinced that a bird ate my USB stick, and the leopard seal then ate the bird, because he had a lot of feathers in the scat. And then bizarrely I come along and say \u2018oh there\u2019s a sample we should send to Niwa\u2019,\u201d Nally said. A Niwa spokesperson confirmed the theory. Nally said she had told Niwa they could keep the USB stick as she had the footage backed up in various places. \u201cNo one needs to spend $1 on the postage, I have many copies of this footage, it is some of my favourite\u201d. Nally is aware how strange this string of events is. \u201cThis is probably the weirdest set of coincidences in my life \u2013 ever.\u201d",

They were arrested, beaten and allegedly tortured. Their faces were broadcast on state television and branded as traitors. Al-Araibi, who fled to Australia while on bail for the now infamous vandalism charges, told media in 2016 he was detained for three months and tortured, with guards targeting his legs and telling him he\u2019d never play football again. He accused Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al Khalifa, a Bahraini royal and head of the country\u2019s football body, of abandoning his players.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"371fa1e7ed50e3d465b456b0b79aefa0a83a9462\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/371fa1e7ed50e3d465b456b0b79aefa0a83a9462/0_0_2719_4000/680.jpg\" alt=\"Hakeen al-Araibi gestures to supporters upon arrival at Melbourne airport on Tuesday.\" width=\"680\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hakeen al-Araibi gestures to supporters upon arrival at Melbourne airport on Tuesday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Barbour/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Al-Araibi believes it was this public denunciation of the regime and in particular Sheikh Salman that motivated his Bangkok arrest.</p> \n<p>Throughout Al-Araibi detention, Bahrain refused to answer questions. Instead it released statements through its PR department, proclaiming the fairness and transparency of its justice system, and the legitimacy of its pursuit of Al-Araibi.</p> \n<p>Al-Araibi was arrested in Bangkok on the basis of an erroneously issued Interpol red notice. Red notices are requests \u201cto locate and provisionally arrest an individual pending extradition\u201d, according to Interpol, but not every country treats them that way. There are clear rules on their use when it comes to refugees (more on that later).</p> \n<p>Bahrain\u2019s red notice was ostensibly over Al-Araibi\u2019s 10-year sentence delivered in absentia for a vandalism act in 2012 which was near impossible for him to commit as he was playing in a televised football match that evening.</p> \n<p>The red notice, seen by the Guardian, reveals it was not granted until 8 November last year \u2013 the same day Al-Araibi was told by Thailand\u2019s Melbourne consulate his visa was ready.</p> \n<p>There are widespread suspicions Bahrain had Al-Araibi under surveillance or was tipped off about his travel plans, perhaps by the consulate.</p> \n<p>Bahrain will not say why it chose now to seek a red notice, or how it obtained one against Interpol policy.</p> \n<p>It has given no indication it will give up chasing Al-Araibi. Even after his release, Bahrain maintained its \u201cright\u201d to continue pursuing him, and suggested it had requested his extradition from Australia.</p> \n<h2><strong>Why did Thailand acquiesce to Bahrain for so long? </strong></h2> \n<p>One largely perplexing aspect of the case is why Thailand continued to entertain Bahrain\u2019s extradition request in the face of mounting evidence it was illegitimate.</p> \n<p>Thai documents seen by the Guardian reveal immigration authorities were initially confused by Al-Araibi\u2019s refugee travel papers, but fully intended to return him to Australia because he was a refugee.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4701a0247d49d53cb7bbc55cc8a8d25a8e7cecef\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4701a0247d49d53cb7bbc55cc8a8d25a8e7cecef/0_0_3500_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hakeem al-Araibi in shackles as he leaves Thailand\u2019s criminal court in Bangkok on 4 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"720\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hakeem al-Araibi in shackles as he leaves Thailand\u2019s criminal court in Bangkok on 4 February.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Al-Araibi was told to book a flight home, but just a few hours before the plane left he was suddenly transferred from immigration detention to a Bangkok prison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/18/i-spent-the-first-day-of-my-honeymoon-in-a-jail-cell-with-my-husband-hakeem-al-araibi\">his wife left panicking</a> after she was told she would not see him again.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/18/i-spent-the-first-day-of-my-honeymoon-in-a-jail-cell-with-my-husband-hakeem-al-araibi\">I spent the first day of my honeymoon in a jail cell with my husband</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The abrupt change followed a tweet by Bahrain\u2019s embassy in Thailand that it was following his case.</p> \n<p>Even when the red notice was lifted \u2013 after Australian authorities realised their mistake (more on that later) \u2013 Thailand revealed a separate arrest request from Bahrain which they said justified his continued detention.</p> \n<p>Thailand and Bahrain have huge development deals and tax break arrangements, and share the culture of a ruling monarchy, but the former\u2019s continuing acquiescence to the latter, to the growing detriment of its also strong relationship with Australia, puzzled observers.</p> \n<p>Their sharp turnaround was perhaps more readily explained by the international outrage focused on them after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/04/hakeem-al-araibi-bahrain-thailand-court-extradition\">images of a barefoot and shackled Al-Araibi </a>went viral, prompting domestic anger (ahead of a Thai election) and calls for travel boycotts.</p> \n<p>Thailand sought to paint itself as stuck in the middle of Australia and Bahrain, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/06/thailand-tells-australia-and-bahrain-to-cooperate-over-hakeem-al-araibi\">implored the two countries to find a solution</a>, but then it appeared to find its own.</p> \n<p>One day before Al-Araibi\u2019s release <a href=\"https://www.bna.bh/en/HRHCrownPrincereceivestheMinisterofForeignAffairsofThailand.aspx?cms=q8FmFJgiscL2fwIzON1%2bDhf6xYXQdCgooLiFEXsJFdg%3d\">the Thai foreign minister visited Bahrain\u2019s crown prince</a>, Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, in Manama to discuss \u201cbilateral relations between Bahrain and Thailand and reviewed areas of mutual interest\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"27c2e676-c445-4f07-a3cf-1d06515705ae\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/heeZotSu3g0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>How </strong><strong>did Interpol </strong><strong> fail</strong><strong> </strong><strong> to protect a refugee?</strong></h2> \n<p>Interpol has consistently refused to answer questions about its error, which was arguably the primary cause of Al-Araibi\u2019s detention.</p> \n<p>Strict policies \u2013 used since 2014 and codified in 2015 \u2013 are supposed to ensure no country can issue a red notice for someone who fled it and gained refugee status elsewhere. The policies were designed to prevent governments from abusing the red notice system to persecute dissidents.</p> \n<p>Essentially Interpol should never have said yes to Bahrain\u2019s request, but they did. And now they won\u2019t say why.</p> \n<p>Repeated requests for answers have drawn no comment, and occasionally referrals to the Bahraini government. Questions submitted since Al-Araibi was released have not received a response.</p> \n<h2><strong>Did the failings of Australian police compound Al-Araibi\u2019s plight?</strong></h2> \n<p>Interpol\u2019s error could have been picked up in Australia.</p> \n<p>Australian federal police (AFP) officers are seconded to Australia\u2019s national central bureau for Interpol, running the country\u2019s operations within the international information sharing system.</p> \n<p>When the red notice was granted to Bahrain no one in the Canberra-based NCB saw that it was against a refugee to whom Australia had given protection.</p> \n<p>The AFP has said Interpol membership creates \u201ccertain obligations\u201d on member agencies, and suggested it was within this that the AFP notified Thailand of Al-Araibi\u2019s pending arrival. Even if it had not, the red notice would have been flagged by Thai immigration on his arrival, and separately Bahrain had also requested his arrest.</p> \n<p>Guardian Australia understands the AFP notification is a largely automatic process to give countries a heads up that someone subject to a red notice is on the way. But the former head of Australian Border Force, Roman Quaedvlieg, has said it would have taken a simple phone call or two to realise the horrifying error that had been made. Al-Araibi had no idea of the red notice\u2019s existence when he got on that Jetstar flight from Melbourne.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/24/please-help-me-refugee-footballer-hakeem-al-araibi-tells-of-his-thai-jail-ordeal\">'Please help me': refugee footballer Hakeem al-Araibi tells of his Thai jail ordeal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Al-Araibi said he\u2019d asked the immigration department before travelling and was told he\u2019d be safe.

      "bodyText": "As Hakeem al-Araibi settles back into his life in Melbourne after 76 days in a Thai prison, supporters and campaigners for his release will turn their sights to those who could have, and should have, done more. Myriad intersecting themes in Al-Araibi\u2019s case crossed international diplomacy, global law enforcement, football geopolitics, domestic politics, greed, nepotism and refugee law. There were allegations and suspicions of incompetence and underhandedness, laziness and manipulation. Many questions remain unanswered, and it will be here that campaigners train their sights now Al-Araibi is home. Key parties have serious questions to answer over their actions in the case of Al-Araibi. Who orchestrated the pursuit of Al-Araibi? Everything comes back to Bahrain, the tiny Gulf state with a ruling monarchy and a reputation for crushing opposition and dissent. In 2011/12 authorities launched a brutal crackdown on athletes who took part in pro-democracy protests. They were arrested, beaten and allegedly tortured. Their faces were broadcast on state television and branded as traitors. Al-Araibi, who fled to Australia while on bail for the now infamous vandalism charges, told media in 2016 he was detained for three months and tortured, with guards targeting his legs and telling him he\u2019d never play football again. He accused Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al Khalifa, a Bahraini royal and head of the country\u2019s football body, of abandoning his players. Al-Araibi believes it was this public denunciation of the regime and in particular Sheikh Salman that motivated his Bangkok arrest. Throughout Al-Araibi detention, Bahrain refused to answer questions. Instead it released statements through its PR department, proclaiming the fairness and transparency of its justice system, and the legitimacy of its pursuit of Al-Araibi. Al-Araibi was arrested in Bangkok on the basis of an erroneously issued Interpol red notice. Red notices are requests \u201cto locate and provisionally arrest an individual pending extradition\u201d, according to Interpol, but not every country treats them that way. There are clear rules on their use when it comes to refugees (more on that later). Bahrain\u2019s red notice was ostensibly over Al-Araibi\u2019s 10-year sentence delivered in absentia for a vandalism act in 2012 which was near impossible for him to commit as he was playing in a televised football match that evening. The red notice, seen by the Guardian, reveals it was not granted until 8 November last year \u2013 the same day Al-Araibi was told by Thailand\u2019s Melbourne consulate his visa was ready. There are widespread suspicions Bahrain had Al-Araibi under surveillance or was tipped off about his travel plans, perhaps by the consulate. Bahrain will not say why it chose now to seek a red notice, or how it obtained one against Interpol policy. It has given no indication it will give up chasing Al-Araibi. Even after his release, Bahrain maintained its \u201cright\u201d to continue pursuing him, and suggested it had requested his extradition from Australia. Why did Thailand acquiesce to Bahrain for so long? One largely perplexing aspect of the case is why Thailand continued to entertain Bahrain\u2019s extradition request in the face of mounting evidence it was illegitimate. Thai documents seen by the Guardian reveal immigration authorities were initially confused by Al-Araibi\u2019s refugee travel papers, but fully intended to return him to Australia because he was a refugee. Al-Araibi was told to book a flight home, but just a few hours before the plane left he was suddenly transferred from immigration detention to a Bangkok prison, his wife left panicking after she was told she would not see him again. The abrupt change followed a tweet by Bahrain\u2019s embassy in Thailand that it was following his case. Even when the red notice was lifted \u2013 after Australian authorities realised their mistake (more on that later) \u2013 Thailand revealed a separate arrest request from Bahrain which they said justified his continued detention. Thailand and Bahrain have huge development deals and tax break arrangements, and share the culture of a ruling monarchy, but the former\u2019s continuing acquiescence to the latter, to the growing detriment of its also strong relationship with Australia, puzzled observers. Their sharp turnaround was perhaps more readily explained by the international outrage focused on them after images of a barefoot and shackled Al-Araibi went viral, prompting domestic anger (ahead of a Thai election) and calls for travel boycotts. Thailand sought to paint itself as stuck in the middle of Australia and Bahrain, and implored the two countries to find a solution, but then it appeared to find its own. One day before Al-Araibi\u2019s release the Thai foreign minister visited Bahrain\u2019s crown prince, Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, in Manama to discuss \u201cbilateral relations between Bahrain and Thailand and reviewed areas of mutual interest\u201d. How did Interpol fail to protect a refugee? Interpol has consistently refused to answer questions about its error, which was arguably the primary cause of Al-Araibi\u2019s detention. Strict policies \u2013 used since 2014 and codified in 2015 \u2013 are supposed to ensure no country can issue a red notice for someone who fled it and gained refugee status elsewhere. The policies were designed to prevent governments from abusing the red notice system to persecute dissidents. Essentially Interpol should never have said yes to Bahrain\u2019s request, but they did. And now they won\u2019t say why. Repeated requests for answers have drawn no comment, and occasionally referrals to the Bahraini government. Questions submitted since Al-Araibi was released have not received a response. Did the failings of Australian police compound Al-Araibi\u2019s plight? Interpol\u2019s error could have been picked up in Australia. Australian federal police (AFP) officers are seconded to Australia\u2019s national central bureau for Interpol, running the country\u2019s operations within the international information sharing system. When the red notice was granted to Bahrain no one in the Canberra-based NCB saw that it was against a refugee to whom Australia had given protection. The AFP has said Interpol membership creates \u201ccertain obligations\u201d on member agencies, and suggested it was within this that the AFP notified Thailand of Al-Araibi\u2019s pending arrival. Even if it had not, the red notice would have been flagged by Thai immigration on his arrival, and separately Bahrain had also requested his arrest. Guardian Australia understands the AFP notification is a largely automatic process to give countries a heads up that someone subject to a red notice is on the way. But the former head of Australian Border Force, Roman Quaedvlieg, has said it would have taken a simple phone call or two to realise the horrifying error that had been made. Al-Araibi had no idea of the red notice\u2019s existence when he got on that Jetstar flight from Melbourne. Al-Araibi said he\u2019d asked the immigration department before travelling and was told he\u2019d be safe. Crikey has since reported the UK government informally warns Bahrainis not to go to Thailand. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, later said on radio: \u201cPlease don\u2019t go to countries where you can put yourself at risk in these situations.\u201d From the moment Al-Araibi was arrested, Australia\u2019s Bangkok embassy and the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, worked extraordinarily hard behind the scenes. Officials were partially hamstrung by the fact he is a permanent resident, not a citizen. Al-Araibi\u2019s lawyer facilitated a fast-track citizenship application, hoping that would help, but it stalled with the home affairs department. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said little on the case. At an early press conference Dutton appeared to suggest the red notice \u2013 which had already been lifted \u2013 may be legitimate. On Tuesday Dutton said the government would be \u201clooking into\u201d the AFP\u2019s involvement. Morrison lent his weight in late January after Olympians lobbied for his personal intervention \u2013 something campaigners said had a significant impact. Why did the world\u2019s footballing bodies fail to put a person\u2019s life before their own interests? We\u2019ll never know if Al-Araibi would have been freed without the contribution of athletes and powerful sporting bodies to the global campaign for his freedom. But we do know that those with the most power appeared to do the least. Fifa and the Asian Football Confederation hold enormous sway in the region and, following revelations of migrant abuse in Qatar during preparations for the World Cup, had created their own human rights codes which obliged executives to use all available means and leverage to protect the human rights of players. Al-Araibi\u2019s detention was the first real test of those codes, and according to people like Craig Foster, they failed the test. \u201cThe inability of football to step forward on this is plain to see,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThey needed to be pushed to save a human life. \u201cThe people at the heart of this \u2013 and that includes some of the Bahraini royals \u2013 that has to be looked at immediately.\u201d Sheikh Salman is vice president of Fifa and this year intends to run for the presidency. He tried once before but lost to Gianni Infantino amid all the bad press from Al-Araibi and others about the Bahraini human right abuses. Fifa was slow to say much at all about Al-Araibi, and it was only several weeks into his detention that it began to more forcefully call for his release, albeit in statements directed away from Bahrain. Sheikh Salman also holds the presidency of the Asian Football Confederation, which said even less, only calling for his release once formal extradition papers were lodged with Thai authorities. Through its head of communications, the AFC repeatedly refused to answer questions about or directed to Sheikh Salman, and argued with suggestions that it was not respecting human rights. Pressure increased until late January when it suddenly announced Sheikh Salman had recused himself from regional responsibilities for fear of perceptions of conflicts of interest. According to the AFC its vice president, Praful Patel, was the relevant executive, although he also refused to answer any questions about his efforts. Lobbying efforts went beyond football, and in February a coalition of Olympians called for the International Olympic Committee and Fifa to threaten sanctions on Bahrain and Thailand if Al-Araibi was not released. Football Federation Australia holds much less international power, but was equally criticised for its muted efforts. Top executives actually met with Sheikh Salman the day after Al-Araibi was arrested, but say they didn\u2019t know at the time. It would be another six weeks before the executives would get in the room with him again \u2013 on the sidelines of the Asian Cup \u2013 and pass on Australia\u2019s wish to see Al-Araibi freed.

      "bodyText": "Beijing\u2019s latest efforts to dispel criticism of its treatment of Uighur Muslims in the northwestern Chinese territory of Xinjiang appear to be backfiring. In an effort to dispel rumours of the death of famous Uighur musician Abdurehim Heyit, who disappeared in Xinjiang in 2017, Chinese state media released a video of Heyit attesting to his health. In the video, he says he is in police custody and has \u201cnever been abused\u201d. Now, activists and members of the Uighur diaspora are calling for proof of life videos of their relatives who have disappeared into a network of internment camps that China claims are \u201cvocational training centres\u201d. Under the hashtag #MeTooUyghur, members of the Uighur community are posting the names and photos of their missing family members. \u201cChinese authorities showed video as proof Mr Heyit is still alive. Now, we want to know, where are millions of Uyghurs?\u201d Murat Harri Uyghur, an activist living in Finland, posted on Twitter, calling on others to join the campaign. Advocates say one million people from the ethnic minority Muslim group have been forced into the camps where they undergo forced political indoctrination, abuse, and isolation from from their families. Some believe many more have been detained. Arslan Hidayat, the son-in-law of a prominent Uighur comedian, Adil Mijit, who has been missing since November, said in a video posted on Facebook: \u201cWe would also like a similar sort of proof of life video of Adil Mijit and the rest of our three to five million brothers and sisters who have been locked up in Chinese concentration camps.\u201d Tahir Imin, an activist based in Washington, wrote: \u201cShow us my daughter\u2026 11 children separated from their parents, and 20 family members including my brother Adil, stepmom Tuhan, sister Patigul and Turaqiz, my cousins Yusup, Ghappat, Niyaz \u2026\u201d Uighurs outside of China struggle to glean information about family that have been sent to the camps. Many have not been able to speak to their relatives in China for years. Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang can be punished for communicating with people outside of the country, especially those in Muslim-majority countries. WeChat, the primary messaging platform, is believed to be closely surveilled. On Saturday, Turkey issued a rare rebuke of China in a statement citing reports of Heyit\u2019s death. Turkey, which has long welcomed Uighur refugees, called China\u2019s treatment of Uighurs a \u201cgreat shame for humanity\u201d. On Monday, China\u2019s foreign ministry called Turkey\u2019s statement \u201cabsurd lies\u201d and said that Heyit was being investigated for endangering national security. Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the ministry defended China\u2019s policies in Xinjiang, previously home to outbursts of ethnic violence and attacks. \u201cDrawing on the anti-terrorism experience of the international community and based on its realities, the Chinese government has been actively working to counter terrorism and extremism and made notable achievements. People in Xinjiang now have a stronger sense of security, happiness and fulfilment,\u201d she said.",

To the retired Britons who live here? The thousands of Spaniards who work in the UK? We\u2019ve all got a friend or know someone who\u2019s a nurse in a British hospital or a teacher in a British university.\u201d</p> <p>Ignacio Molina, a senior analyst at the <a href=\"http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/rielcano_es/biografia/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/elcanov2_es/elcanov2/investigadores/ignacio-molina\">Elcano Royal Institute</a> in Madrid, agrees Brexit has disfigured the image of British politics as \u201cmoderate, pragmatic and dependable\u201d. In the bungled departure preparations, he sees echoes of the UK\u2019s post-imperial wane.</p> <p>According to Molina, the \u201csystemic failure\u201d of Brexit has called into question the very idea of \u201cthe great British democracy. It\u2019s a project that hasn\u2019t been thought through. Even with Trump, there\u2019s a strategy. But with Brexit there\u2019s no strategy and no plan. It\u2019s the most un-British thing there is!\u201d <strong>Sam Jones</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dab25f300b497f3b68c57b3d67132f0c172ee9c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dab25f300b497f3b68c57b3d67132f0c172ee9c1/2_0_7107_4267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brexit and Europe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>France</h2> <p>As Brexit turns into what one French commentator called a \u201cnational psychodrama\u201d \u2013 or, in the more prosaic words of a friend, \u201cun big mess\u201d \u2013 many French are addressing Britons with the sympathy normally reserved for the bereaved. \u201cSo sorry,\u201d they say, as a no-deal B-Day looms. \u201cWhat will you do now?\u201d</p> <p>There is little gloating, much genuine concern, and massive incomprehension. <a href=\"https://www.franceinter.fr/emissions/geopolitique/geopolitique-13-decembre-2018\">The journalist Pierre Haski sums up Brexit bafflement</a>: \u201cDid electors really vote Brexit to allow the haughty aristocrat Jacob Rees-Mogg or the demagogue Boris Johnson to challenge Theresa May \u2026 or for Jeremy Corbyn to get into Downing Street without saying what he will do about Brexit?\u201d It was a genuine question.</p> <p>The Channel tunnel has been key to softening historically fraught Anglo-French relations; personal and cultural links have grown richer now that travelling between Paris and London is less traumatic than the average commute.</p> <p>As for the infamous \u201clove-hate\u201d relationship, of late the loathing has been largely one way. Screaming British tabloid headlines accuse France of deliberately orchestrating no-deal mayhem, while in the real world the French government is doing precisely the opposite.</p> <p>Thankfully, the abuse is shrugged off. If there is a response, it is frustration. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours on Brexit \u2013 and we do have other things to do,\u201d one French civil servant tells me.</p> <p>Some try to make sense of the Westminster spectacle. Jean-Marc Puissesseau, the president of the company that runs the Calais port \u2013 also working hard to avoid Brexit chaos \u2013 says there were signs of Brexit years ago. \u201cYou had special conditions. You continued to drive on the left, you kept the pound \u2026 perhaps Great Britain is so fundamentally insular and protective of its own future and freedom, this is its destiny. But it\u2019s a pity.\u201d</p> <p>H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Orain, the director of Paris\u2019s Museum of Immigration, hopes \u201cthe links between our countries will not stop, and we can continue to recount our common history\u201d.</p> <p>If there is any silver lining to the present impenetrable Brexit cloud, it may be a growing feeling, for many Britons in France, that behind all the \u201cfrog\u201d and \u201crosbif\u201d nonsense, the French are really quite fond of us. <strong>Kim Willsher</strong></p> <h2>Czech Republic</h2> <p>Signs of Anglophilia are easy to spot in Prague: a square named after Winston Churchill, a bunch of English-language bookshops and several branches of Marks &amp; Spencer. Since the Velvet revolution that heralded the end of communism in 1989, most Czech politicians, diplomats and opinion-formers have routinely deferred to Britain as a cradle of democracy and common sense. All this has added to Czechs\u2019 bewilderment at the seemingly chaotic drama unfolding at Westminster as the UK staggers towards the EU departure gate.</p> <p>Ji\u0159\u00ed Pehe, a political analyst and director at New York University in Prague, recently summed up the mood when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JiriPehe/status/1087663375780323328\">he tweeted that politics in Britain</a> had become even worse than its Czech counterpart. \u201cThe infantilisation of politics, to say \u2018if it\u2019s not my way, it won\u2019t be any other way\u2019, reminds me of Czech politics,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe ascribe it to the fact that Czech democracy is so young, and recovering from communism. To see an established democracy like Britain descending into this chaos and irrationality is really disheartening. It\u2019s a very comprehensive defeat for British politics.\u201d</p> <p>Some Czech policymakers worry that Britain\u2019s impending departure from the EU will undermine the Nato alliance. Yet growing awareness of the political paralysis wrought by Brexit may have had one unexpected spin-off \u2013 a rise in support for EU membership here, where recorded levels of Euroscepticism have often matched, or even surpassed, those in Britain.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence that support for the EU, although still under 40%, has risen in the last two years and one of the reasons is the mess we see in London,\u201d says Ond\u0159ej Houska, a European affairs specialist with the daily Hospod\u00e1\u0159sk\u00e9 newspaper. \u201cIf we\u2019d voted for Czexit, I could have expected to see this in Prague. But Britain has never experienced totalitarianism, its civil service is world class, its political elite went to Oxford and Cambridge \u2013 so we\u2019re amazed at their inability to agree on anything.\u201d <strong>Robert Tait</strong></p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p>In the days after the Brexit vote, Britons would remark that the Germans must be positively swimming in schadenfreude, after we had caused so much trouble in the EU. But among the people I spoke to \u2013 government spokespeople, supermarket cashiers, diplomats and taxi drivers \u2013 the overwhelming emotions were sadness and disappointment.</p> <p>A diplomat likens his melancholy to that of being dumped by a girlfriend. \u201cI still have her jumper and I go round wearing it, hoping her scent will linger,\u201d he says. He clings to the positive aspects of a Britain he cherished \u2013 from punk music to humour \u2013 and almost breaks into song: \u201cThey can\u2019t take that away from me.\u201d</p> <p>Germans are also resigned \u2013 if frustrated - by British misperceptions, from Boris Johnson\u2019s claims that a \u201cGerman-led\u201d EU is pursuing <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/14/boris-johnson-the-eu-wants-a-superstate-just-as-hitler-did/\">a Hitlerian superstate</a> to the notion that Berlin would force the EU to submit to the UK\u2019s Brexit demands <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/1045291/Germany-news-German-cars-motoring-industry-Angela-Merkel-Brexit-Theresa-May.\">in order to save the German car industry</a>. They are also immune to the British tabloids\u2019 assertions <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6625529/ALEX-VON-SCHOENBURG-Germans-owe-Britain-great-debt.html\">that Germany is morally indebted to Britain</a> for the defeat of Hitler, and so should throw Theresa May a lifeline.</p> <p>It\u2019s a sign of the affection many Germans harbour for the UK that such feelings have not been dented. Even in their Brexit bewilderment, Germans still love holidaying in the UK, savour our lively parliamentary debate and obsess over the royals. But increasingly, they are coping with Brexit by separating Britain into two entities: cultural and political. Many kick themselves that they did not see it coming; some ask what what they can do to help reverse it.</p> <p>But not everyone. A professor of risk assessment tells me the path to Brexit was long clear in Britain\u2019s difficult relationship with the EU. \u201cI think it is time Britain left now,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help anyone, least of all the British, for them to stay in.\u201d</p> <p>I am one of thousands of Britons living here to have taken German citizenship since the referendum. <a href=\"https://www.hanser-literaturverlage.de/buch/exit-brexit/978-3-446-26024-5/\">My book on the process, Exit Brexit,</a> has had an overwhelming response. That a Brit is prepared to embrace historically tarred Germany, in the way lots of Germans have embraced Britain, astonishes many.</p> <p>\u201cIf Brexit doesn\u2019t happen, will you keep your German passport?\u201d one interviewer asked. I assured her I have no intention of giving it up. <strong>Kate Connolly</strong></p> <h2>Poland</h2> <p>Poland\u2019s attitude towards Britain might be characterised as largely affectionate \u2013 but with an edge. Brexit is not helping.</p> <p>The wartime alliance is remembered in Poland as much in terms of British betrayals as of Polish pilots and the Enigma machine.</p> <p>Resentment eased during the cold war thanks to Britain\u2019s role as a key adversary of communist Poland\u2019s Soviet overlords, and the emergence \u2013 incongruously, for many \u2013 of Margaret Thatcher as a heroine of the Polish proletariat.</p> <p>At first, the large-scale migration of Poles\u2013 admired for their work ethic and almost universally accepted \u2013 to the UK in the 2000s appeared to herald a golden age in relations between the two nations. Many Britons assume the new arrivals were motivated exclusively by money, but many were also attracted by modern British multiculturalism. \u201cI loved the freedom. I remember thinking: \u2018This is it! This is my place on earth,\u2019\u201d a Polish woman who moved to the UK in 1999 tells me.</p> <p>That love of Britain has only intensified the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/27/everything-changed-in-2016-poles-in-uk-struggle-with-brexit\">pain of rejection</a> after the Brexit vote. Complicating matters further, it is increasingly apparent that many other Poles living in the UK never accepted Britain\u2019s multicultural model in the first place. Feeling rejected and economically exploited, the Polish community is increasingly a recruiting ground for the far right in both countries.</p> <p>There are of course many Poles who still live perfectly happily in the UK, and will continue to do so. But the feeling that they are now being rejected, having once been welcomed, is leading to the return of some old resentments. For many, the love affair with Britain is turning sour. <strong>Christian Davies</strong></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",

We\u2019ve all got a friend or know someone who\u2019s a nurse in a British hospital or a teacher in a British university.\u201d Ignacio Molina, a senior analyst at the Elcano Royal Institute in Madrid, agrees Brexit has disfigured the image of British politics as \u201cmoderate, pragmatic and dependable\u201d. In the bungled departure preparations, he sees echoes of the UK\u2019s post-imperial wane. According to Molina, the \u201csystemic failure\u201d of Brexit has called into question the very idea of \u201cthe great British democracy. It\u2019s a project that hasn\u2019t been thought through. Even with Trump, there\u2019s a strategy. But with Brexit there\u2019s no strategy and no plan. It\u2019s the most un-British thing there is!\u201d Sam Jones France As Brexit turns into what one French commentator called a \u201cnational psychodrama\u201d \u2013 or, in the more prosaic words of a friend, \u201cun big mess\u201d \u2013 many French are addressing Britons with the sympathy normally reserved for the bereaved. \u201cSo sorry,\u201d they say, as a no-deal B-Day looms. \u201cWhat will you do now?\u201d There is little gloating, much genuine concern, and massive incomprehension. The journalist Pierre Haski sums up Brexit bafflement: \u201cDid electors really vote Brexit to allow the haughty aristocrat Jacob Rees-Mogg or the demagogue Boris Johnson to challenge Theresa May \u2026 or for Jeremy Corbyn to get into Downing Street without saying what he will do about Brexit?\u201d It was a genuine question. The Channel tunnel has been key to softening historically fraught Anglo-French relations; personal and cultural links have grown richer now that travelling between Paris and London is less traumatic than the average commute. As for the infamous \u201clove-hate\u201d relationship, of late the loathing has been largely one way. Screaming British tabloid headlines accuse France of deliberately orchestrating no-deal mayhem, while in the real world the French government is doing precisely the opposite. Thankfully, the abuse is shrugged off. If there is a response, it is frustration. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours on Brexit \u2013 and we do have other things to do,\u201d one French civil servant tells me. Some try to make sense of the Westminster spectacle. Jean-Marc Puissesseau, the president of the company that runs the Calais port \u2013 also working hard to avoid Brexit chaos \u2013 says there were signs of Brexit years ago. \u201cYou had special conditions. You continued to drive on the left, you kept the pound \u2026 perhaps Great Britain is so fundamentally insular and protective of its own future and freedom, this is its destiny. But it\u2019s a pity.\u201d H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Orain, the director of Paris\u2019s Museum of Immigration, hopes \u201cthe links between our countries will not stop, and we can continue to recount our common history\u201d. If there is any silver lining to the present impenetrable Brexit cloud, it may be a growing feeling, for many Britons in France, that behind all the \u201cfrog\u201d and \u201crosbif\u201d nonsense, the French are really quite fond of us. Kim Willsher Czech Republic Signs of Anglophilia are easy to spot in Prague: a square named after Winston Churchill, a bunch of English-language bookshops and several branches of Marks &amp; Spencer. Since the Velvet revolution that heralded the end of communism in 1989, most Czech politicians, diplomats and opinion-formers have routinely deferred to Britain as a cradle of democracy and common sense. All this has added to Czechs\u2019 bewilderment at the seemingly chaotic drama unfolding at Westminster as the UK staggers towards the EU departure gate. Ji\u0159\u00ed Pehe, a political analyst and director at New York University in Prague, recently summed up the mood when he tweeted that politics in Britain had become even worse than its Czech counterpart. \u201cThe infantilisation of politics, to say \u2018if it\u2019s not my way, it won\u2019t be any other way\u2019, reminds me of Czech politics,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe ascribe it to the fact that Czech democracy is so young, and recovering from communism. To see an established democracy like Britain descending into this chaos and irrationality is really disheartening. It\u2019s a very comprehensive defeat for British politics.\u201d Some Czech policymakers worry that Britain\u2019s impending departure from the EU will undermine the Nato alliance. Yet growing awareness of the political paralysis wrought by Brexit may have had one unexpected spin-off \u2013 a rise in support for EU membership here, where recorded levels of Euroscepticism have often matched, or even surpassed, those in Britain. \u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence that support for the EU, although still under 40%, has risen in the last two years and one of the reasons is the mess we see in London,\u201d says Ond\u0159ej Houska, a European affairs specialist with the daily Hospod\u00e1\u0159sk\u00e9 newspaper. \u201cIf we\u2019d voted for Czexit, I could have expected to see this in Prague. But Britain has never experienced totalitarianism, its civil service is world class, its political elite went to Oxford and Cambridge \u2013 so we\u2019re amazed at their inability to agree on anything.\u201d Robert Tait Germany In the days after the Brexit vote, Britons would remark that the Germans must be positively swimming in schadenfreude, after we had caused so much trouble in the EU. But among the people I spoke to \u2013 government spokespeople, supermarket cashiers, diplomats and taxi drivers \u2013 the overwhelming emotions were sadness and disappointment. A diplomat likens his melancholy to that of being dumped by a girlfriend. \u201cI still have her jumper and I go round wearing it, hoping her scent will linger,\u201d he says. He clings to the positive aspects of a Britain he cherished \u2013 from punk music to humour \u2013 and almost breaks into song: \u201cThey can\u2019t take that away from me.\u201d Germans are also resigned \u2013 if frustrated - by British misperceptions, from Boris Johnson\u2019s claims that a \u201cGerman-led\u201d EU is pursuing a Hitlerian superstate to the notion that Berlin would force the EU to submit to the UK\u2019s Brexit demands in order to save the German car industry. They are also immune to the British tabloids\u2019 assertions that Germany is morally indebted to Britain for the defeat of Hitler, and so should throw Theresa May a lifeline. It\u2019s a sign of the affection many Germans harbour for the UK that such feelings have not been dented. Even in their Brexit bewilderment, Germans still love holidaying in the UK, savour our lively parliamentary debate and obsess over the royals. But increasingly, they are coping with Brexit by separating Britain into two entities: cultural and political. Many kick themselves that they did not see it coming; some ask what what they can do to help reverse it. But not everyone. A professor of risk assessment tells me the path to Brexit was long clear in Britain\u2019s difficult relationship with the EU. \u201cI think it is time Britain left now,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help anyone, least of all the British, for them to stay in.\u201d I am one of thousands of Britons living here to have taken German citizenship since the referendum. My book on the process, Exit Brexit, has had an overwhelming response. That a Brit is prepared to embrace historically tarred Germany, in the way lots of Germans have embraced Britain, astonishes many. \u201cIf Brexit doesn\u2019t happen, will you keep your German passport?\u201d one interviewer asked. I assured her I have no intention of giving it up. Kate Connolly Poland Poland\u2019s attitude towards Britain might be characterised as largely affectionate \u2013 but with an edge. Brexit is not helping. The wartime alliance is remembered in Poland as much in terms of British betrayals as of Polish pilots and the Enigma machine. Resentment eased during the cold war thanks to Britain\u2019s role as a key adversary of communist Poland\u2019s Soviet overlords, and the emergence \u2013 incongruously, for many \u2013 of Margaret Thatcher as a heroine of the Polish proletariat. At first, the large-scale migration of Poles\u2013 admired for their work ethic and almost universally accepted \u2013 to the UK in the 2000s appeared to herald a golden age in relations between the two nations. Many Britons assume the new arrivals were motivated exclusively by money, but many were also attracted by modern British multiculturalism. \u201cI loved the freedom. I remember thinking: \u2018This is it! This is my place on earth,\u2019\u201d a Polish woman who moved to the UK in 1999 tells me. That love of Britain has only intensified the pain of rejection after the Brexit vote. Complicating matters further, it is increasingly apparent that many other Poles living in the UK never accepted Britain\u2019s multicultural model in the first place. Feeling rejected and economically exploited, the Polish community is increasingly a recruiting ground for the far right in both countries. There are of course many Poles who still live perfectly happily in the UK, and will continue to do so. But the feeling that they are now being rejected, having once been welcomed, is leading to the return of some old resentments. For many, the love affair with Britain is turning sour.

But a growing body of research is assessing how the interplay of these factors can create a cascade of tipping points in human society as well as the natural world.</p> <p>The new paper \u2013 This is a Crisis: Facing up to the Age of Environmental Breakdown \u2013 is a meta-study of dozens of academic papers, government documents and NGO reports compiled by IPPR, a leftwing thinktank that is considered an influence on Labour policy.</p> <p>The authors examine how the deterioration of natural infrastructure, such as a stable climate and fertile land, have a knock-on effect on health, wealth, inequality and migration, which in turn heightens the possibility of political tension and conflict.</p> <p>The paper stresses the human impacts go beyond climate change and are occurring at speeds unprecedented in recorded history.</p> <p>Evidence on the deterioration of natural systems is presented with a series of grim global statistics: topsoil is now being lost 10 to 40 times faster than it is being replenished by natural processes; the 20 warmest years since records began in 1850 have been in the past 22 years; vertebrate populations have fallen by an average of 60% since the 1970s, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/10/plummeting-insect-numbers-threaten-collapse-of-nature\">insect numbers</a> \u2013 vital for pollination \u2013 have declined even faster in some countries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81aea5e87c3af040d9aa19d850609770a8e8734d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81aea5e87c3af040d9aa19d850609770a8e8734d/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flames rise from the La Tune Fire near Burbank, California in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flames rise from the La Tuna fire near Burbank, California in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David McNew/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These processes amplify and interact with existing social and economic problems, potentially threatening systemic collapse similar to the 2008-9 financial crisis. Back then, a subprime mortgage crisis in the US exposed excessive risk-taking and triggered a global panic and the deepest recession since the 1930s. The IPPR study envisages a similar breakdown could occur if the US suffers relentlessly worsening damage from hurricane floods and forest fires, which would prompt a rush of insurance claims and threaten the viability of financial institutions.</p> <p>\u201cIn the extreme, environmental breakdown could trigger catastrophic breakdown of human systems, driving a rapid process of \u2018runaway collapse\u2019 in which economic, social and political shocks cascade through the globally linked system \u2013 in much the same way as occurred in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2007-08,\u201d the paper warns.</p> <p>There are other potential cascades. The paper warns of the vulnerability of food systems that rely on just five animal and 12 plant species to provide 75% of the world\u2019s nutrition. The lack of diversity weakens resilience to the growing risks of climate disruption, soil deterioration, pollution and pollinator loss. Previous research \u2013 cited by the IPPR \u2013 estimates a one-in-20 chance per decade of a simultaneous failure of maize production in the US and China, which provide 60% of the global supply.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/risk-zip/giv-3902LtRasb7bHPvX/\" data-alt=\"Environment v social development graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/risk-zip/giv-3902LtRasb7bHPvX/\">Environment v social development graph</a> </figure>  <p>Migration is also likely to increase as a result of longer droughts and more extreme heat, particularly in the Middle East and central and northern Africa.</p> <p>Laurie Laybourn-Langton, the lead author of the report, said the climate crisis was likely to create 10 times more refugees from that region than the 12 million who left during the Arab spring.</p> <p>\u201cThere would be repercussions in Europe. Rightwing groups use the fear of migration, as we saw during the EU referendum in Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is that going to look like when far more people are forced from homes due to environmental shocks?

      "bodyText": "The gathering storm of human-caused threats to climate, nature and economy pose a danger of systemic collapse comparable to the 2008 financial crisis, according to a new report that calls for urgent and radical reform to protect political and social systems. The study says the combination of global warming, soil infertility, pollinator loss, chemical leaching and ocean acidification is creating a \u201cnew domain of risk\u201d, which is hugely underestimated by policymakers even though it may pose the greatest threat in human history. \u201cA new, highly complex and destabilised \u2018domain of risk\u2019 is emerging \u2013 which includes the risk of the collapse of key social and economic systems, at local and potentially even global levels,\u201d warns the paper from the Institute for Public Policy Research. \u201cThis new risk domain affects virtually all areas of policy and politics, and it is doubtful that societies around the world are adequately prepared to manage this risk.\u201d Until recently, most studies of environmental risk tended to examine threats in isolation: climate scientists examined disruption to weather systems, biologists focused on ecosystem loss and economists calculated potential damages from intensifying storms and droughts. But a growing body of research is assessing how the interplay of these factors can create a cascade of tipping points in human society as well as the natural world. The new paper \u2013 This is a Crisis: Facing up to the Age of Environmental Breakdown \u2013 is a meta-study of dozens of academic papers, government documents and NGO reports compiled by IPPR, a leftwing thinktank that is considered an influence on Labour policy. The authors examine how the deterioration of natural infrastructure, such as a stable climate and fertile land, have a knock-on effect on health, wealth, inequality and migration, which in turn heightens the possibility of political tension and conflict. The paper stresses the human impacts go beyond climate change and are occurring at speeds unprecedented in recorded history. Evidence on the deterioration of natural systems is presented with a series of grim global statistics: topsoil is now being lost 10 to 40 times faster than it is being replenished by natural processes; the 20 warmest years since records began in 1850 have been in the past 22 years; vertebrate populations have fallen by an average of 60% since the 1970s, and insect numbers \u2013 vital for pollination \u2013 have declined even faster in some countries. These processes amplify and interact with existing social and economic problems, potentially threatening systemic collapse similar to the 2008-9 financial crisis. Back then, a subprime mortgage crisis in the US exposed excessive risk-taking and triggered a global panic and the deepest recession since the 1930s. The IPPR study envisages a similar breakdown could occur if the US suffers relentlessly worsening damage from hurricane floods and forest fires, which would prompt a rush of insurance claims and threaten the viability of financial institutions. \u201cIn the extreme, environmental breakdown could trigger catastrophic breakdown of human systems, driving a rapid process of \u2018runaway collapse\u2019 in which economic, social and political shocks cascade through the globally linked system \u2013 in much the same way as occurred in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2007-08,\u201d the paper warns. There are other potential cascades. The paper warns of the vulnerability of food systems that rely on just five animal and 12 plant species to provide 75% of the world\u2019s nutrition. The lack of diversity weakens resilience to the growing risks of climate disruption, soil deterioration, pollution and pollinator loss. Previous research \u2013 cited by the IPPR \u2013 estimates a one-in-20 chance per decade of a simultaneous failure of maize production in the US and China, which provide 60% of the global supply. Migration is also likely to increase as a result of longer droughts and more extreme heat, particularly in the Middle East and central and northern Africa. Laurie Laybourn-Langton, the lead author of the report, said the climate crisis was likely to create 10 times more refugees from that region than the 12 million who left during the Arab spring. \u201cThere would be repercussions in Europe. Rightwing groups use the fear of migration, as we saw during the EU referendum in Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is that going to look like when far more people are forced from homes due to environmental shocks? What does that mean for political cohesion.\u201d Several other recent interdisciplinary studies have highlighted the dangers of mutually reinforcing impacts. In December, the authors of a paper published in Science warned the risks were far greater than assumed because 45% of tipping points were interrelated and could amplify one another. Last August, scientists warns these domino effects could push the Earth into an almost uninhabitable \u201chothouse state\u201d. Studies of financial and social tipping points are scarcer, but concern is growing. Last month, the top three global risks identified by the World Economic Forum were extreme weather, climate policy failure and natural disasters. Water shortages, accelerating biodiversity loss and large-scale involuntary migration also ranked in the top 10. \u201cOf all risks, it is in relation to the environment that the world is most clearly sleepwalking into catastrophe,\u201d its annual risk report warns. \u201cThe results of climate inaction are becoming increasingly clear.

In particular, it says, \u201cthe younger generations will need help in finding the energy and a sense of control that often eludes them as they begin to realise the enormity of inheriting a rapidly destabilising world\u201d.

After I left Derry, with ringing ears, I drove along the often labyrinthine border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, stopping to talk to people for whom that largely invisible line had been a complete irrelevance until the great convulsion of June 2016 put it back on the political agenda. Just about everyone I met knew perfectly well that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/05/theresa-may-wont-seamless-border-northern-ireland-brexit-belfast\" title=\"\">Theresa May\u2019s travails</a> over the so-called backstop are the product of politicians and voters elsewhere forgetting about the island of Ireland, only to be reminded that for the people who live there, Brexit represents a profound set of dangers. No one was that surprised about this amnesia, but many were very angry about it.</p> <p>The boredom with Brexit that I have endlessly encountered in England was nowhere to be seen. Eighty-eight miles from Derry in the old port city of Newry, people talked about a place that had lived in the shadow of the old border for more than 60 years and suffered dire economic consequences, only to undergo an amazing recovery that suddenly feels fragile. Here and elsewhere, there was exasperation at the historical accident that had made Theresa May dependent on the Democratic Unionist party, whose original opposition to the Good Friday agreement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/15/no-surrender-brexit-dup-unionists\" title=\"\">still rankles</a> and whose hostility to the backstop is a central part of Northern Ireland\u2019s current pain. On the other side of the sectarian divide, in even the sleepiest places, I spotted newly printed posters and hoardings demanding a united Ireland, their strident tone betraying the fact that setting out on that road would inevitably trigger no end of strife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f531e7f8d946f8b5e4b59e3edd04411cdae4c657\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f531e7f8d946f8b5e4b59e3edd04411cdae4c657/0_319_3260_1956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"touts band\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Touts, from left: Luke McLaughlin, Matthew Crossan and Jason Feenan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Across the sea, Brexit has triggered a certain obstinacy and aggressive nostalgia among older people, and here, you can pick up something comparable. In the tiny southern Irish border town of Clones, a sixtysomething drinker in a local bar said that Britain could have Brexit if it \u201cgives us back the six counties\u201d, while a younger man shook his head at the discomfiting echo of conflicts he obviously wanted to forget. In Enniskillen, a local member of the DUP who had served in the British army told me that if there was any serious attempt to unite Ireland\u2019s two halves, \u201cI would stand back, and get my uniform back on, and stand firm with the British.\u201d</p> <p>Everywhere I went, people whose views were less entrenched asked the same set of questions. If the UK leaves the EU with no deal, and Northern Ireland and the Republic are suddenly separated by tariffs and new regulations, would that mean the return of what official-speak calls \u201cborder infrastructure\u201d? If it did, wouldn\u2019t that give people spoiling for a fight something to shoot at, or blow up? Whatever the prime minister\u2019s current contortions, what if Brexit \u2013 even with a deal \u2013 and the Ireland envisaged by the Good Friday agreement turn out to be mutually exclusive?</p> <p>Such points were usually balanced by a set of convictions people seemed to be clinging to: that no one wants the border back, and any kind of reversal of the peace process is unthinkable. But then the unease would return as it was acknowledged that Brexit is a veritable Pandora\u2019s box, brimming with unforeseen consequences.</p> <p>What lots of people understood as a matter of instinct was obvious: that in the context of the peace process, the UK\u2019s exit from the EU is a colossal breach of trust, made infinitely worse by the fact that it has been perpetrated so casually. The guilty parties stretch from mindless Tory Brexiteers, through the Labour politicians who have accepted our exit as a given, to the kind of voters who seem to have instant recall of the distant glories of the second world war but huge blind spots when it comes to a conflict that was still rocking the UK only a quarter of a century ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/08/brexit-northern-ireland-backstop\">Think the backstop issue is insoluble?

The damage caused to relations between Dublin and London by Brexit is hardly helping. Among people of Touts\u2019 generation, some of the most pressing political issues centre on the fact that as the Republic has been pushed into a new era of social liberalism, Northern Ireland has been exposed as the last redoubt of very different official attitudes, where abortion remains illegal and equal marriage is still being fought for. And stark regional inequalities have yet to be tackled: for all its cultural vivacity, Derry has deep-seated <a href=\"https://www.derryjournal.com/news/opinion/ask-yourself-why-is-derry-so-poor-and-why-is-nothing-being-done-about-it-1-8439286\" title=\"\">problems with unemployment</a>, and a gross median wage \u00a369 per week lower than in Northern Ireland as a whole.</p> <p>All this feeds into a deep sense of anxiety and uncertainty, not least among young people who yearn to escape the pull of the past and find out what the future might hold.</p> <p>Touts have a song titled <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQmdoIhnizc\" title=\"\">Bomb Scare</a>, which, they say, juxtaposes observations of racism in the US and the European refugee crisis with the insecurities of their home turf.

No one was that surprised about this amnesia, but many were very angry about it. The boredom with Brexit that I have endlessly encountered in England was nowhere to be seen. Eighty-eight miles from Derry in the old port city of Newry, people talked about a place that had lived in the shadow of the old border for more than 60 years and suffered dire economic consequences, only to undergo an amazing recovery that suddenly feels fragile. Here and elsewhere, there was exasperation at the historical accident that had made Theresa May dependent on the Democratic Unionist party, whose original opposition to the Good Friday agreement still rankles and whose hostility to the backstop is a central part of Northern Ireland\u2019s current pain. On the other side of the sectarian divide, in even the sleepiest places, I spotted newly printed posters and hoardings demanding a united Ireland, their strident tone betraying the fact that setting out on that road would inevitably trigger no end of strife. Across the sea, Brexit has triggered a certain obstinacy and aggressive nostalgia among older people, and here, you can pick up something comparable. In the tiny southern Irish border town of Clones, a sixtysomething drinker in a local bar said that Britain could have Brexit if it \u201cgives us back the six counties\u201d, while a younger man shook his head at the discomfiting echo of conflicts he obviously wanted to forget. In Enniskillen, a local member of the DUP who had served in the British army told me that if there was any serious attempt to unite Ireland\u2019s two halves, \u201cI would stand back, and get my uniform back on, and stand firm with the British.\u201d Everywhere I went, people whose views were less entrenched asked the same set of questions. If the UK leaves the EU with no deal, and Northern Ireland and the Republic are suddenly separated by tariffs and new regulations, would that mean the return of what official-speak calls \u201cborder infrastructure\u201d? If it did, wouldn\u2019t that give people spoiling for a fight something to shoot at, or blow up? Whatever the prime minister\u2019s current contortions, what if Brexit \u2013 even with a deal \u2013 and the Ireland envisaged by the Good Friday agreement turn out to be mutually exclusive? Such points were usually balanced by a set of convictions people seemed to be clinging to: that no one wants the border back, and any kind of reversal of the peace process is unthinkable. But then the unease would return as it was acknowledged that Brexit is a veritable Pandora\u2019s box, brimming with unforeseen consequences. What lots of people understood as a matter of instinct was obvious: that in the context of the peace process, the UK\u2019s exit from the EU is a colossal breach of trust, made infinitely worse by the fact that it has been perpetrated so casually. The guilty parties stretch from mindless Tory Brexiteers, through the Labour politicians who have accepted our exit as a given, to the kind of voters who seem to have instant recall of the distant glories of the second world war but huge blind spots when it comes to a conflict that was still rocking the UK only a quarter of a century ago. As a recent car bomb in Derry proves, the challenges of peace and stability are by no means over. Thanks to an arcane scandal about government subsidies for renewable fuels \u2013 which involved vast amounts of wasted public money \u2013 and tensions between Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP over the Irish language, there has been no devolved government since January 2017. The damage caused to relations between Dublin and London by Brexit is hardly helping. Among people of Touts\u2019 generation, some of the most pressing political issues centre on the fact that as the Republic has been pushed into a new era of social liberalism, Northern Ireland has been exposed as the last redoubt of very different official attitudes, where abortion remains illegal and equal marriage is still being fought for. And stark regional inequalities have yet to be tackled: for all its cultural vivacity, Derry has deep-seated problems with unemployment, and a gross median wage \u00a369 per week lower than in Northern Ireland as a whole. All this feeds into a deep sense of anxiety and uncertainty, not least among young people who yearn to escape the pull of the past and find out what the future might hold. Touts have a song titled Bomb Scare, which, they say, juxtaposes observations of racism in the US and the European refugee crisis with the insecurities of their home turf. Its chorus sounds like a glimpse of very real fears: \u201cCheckpoint Charlie / It\u2019s not my heaven / It\u2019s where we\u2019re headed / It\u2019s really not that far away.\u201d To my English ears, it also suggests a finger angrily pointed at people who averted their eyes from Northern Ireland, and thereby committed the gravest Brexit folly of all. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist \u2022 This article was amended on 14 February 2019 to remove a reference to the UK leaving \u201cEurope\u201d; this has been changed to \u201cthe EU\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Two prison inmates have been charged with the attempted murder of drug kingpin Tony Mokbel, who remains in a critical condition in hospital. Police on Tuesday confirmed the pair, both aged 21, had been charged with attempted murder, intentionally causing serious injury and causing serious injury intentionally in circumstances of gross violence, stemming from a stabbing at Barwon Prison yesterday. Mokbel remains in hospital fighting for life after the incident. Aerial footage from Barwon Prison on Monday showed Mokbel bare-chested as paramedics rushed to his aid after reports the 53-year-old was stabbed in an exercise yard. He was taken to Royal Melbourne hospital by helicopter where he remains in a critical condition. The 53-year-old was originally considered to be in a serious but stable condition, but his condition was later upgraded to critical. Victoria police said they were called to Barwon prison at 3.45pm and that a man in his 50s had been airlifted to hospital in a serious condition. \u201cA second victim, aged in his 30s, was taken to hospital by road ambulance also in a serious condition,\u201d police said in a statement. Mokbel was a key figure in the gangland wars in Melbourne in the 1990s and 2000s and was represented by Lawyer X, the gangland lawyer and police informant who is at the centre of an upcoming royal commission. He was charged but not convicted of commissioning the murder of rival Lewis Moran in 2004; a crime for which Carl Williams, to which Mokbel had been linked, was later convicted. Williams was murdered in Barwon prison in 2010. After fleeing Australia while on trial in 2006, Mokbel was captured in Greece in 2007 and was sentenced to a 30-year jail term for drug crimes, with a minimum of at least 22 years before being eligible for parole. But the Lawyer X scandal has opened a possible window of appeal to Mokbel. Williams\u2019 killing came on the same day as a newspaper report outlining that taxpayers paid for the multiple murderer, drug dealer and underworld figure\u2019s child to attend an exclusive private school through a deal with police. Investigations into Mokbel\u2019s stabbing are continuing, police say.",

In January, there were 4,302 reported cases of measles in the country, an increase of 122% on the same period last year. The outbreak has been blamed on a backlash against vaccinations. The outbreak has continued into February. Last week, a measles outbreak was declared in Metro Manila \u2013 populated by 12 million people with many living in poverty-stricken slums. This follows 196 reported cases in January, compared to just 20 recorded in the same period last year. In Manila, 55 children under the age of four have died of measles since the beginning of the year. The department of health has subsequently also declared a \u201cred alert\u201d outbreak in the regions of Luzon and parts of the Visayas \u201cWe are declaring an outbreak as cases have increased in the past weeks and to strengthen surveillance of new cases and alert mothers and caregivers to be more vigilant,\u201d said Francisco Duque, the health secretary, in a statement. It follows on from reports from the department of health and the World Health Organisation (WHO) which showed that, as of December 2018, there were more than 20,000 reported measles cases in the Philippines, a 500% increase on the year before. Measles is a highly contagious disease, but population immunity can be achieved if more than 95% of the population is vaccinated.

The South Korean Olympic Committee chose Seoul, a previous Olympic host, over the southern port city of Busan on Monday. The decision to involve North Korea in the bid reflects warmer diplomatic ties between the neighbours, a year after North Korea sent athletes, supporters and officials to the Winter Olympics in the South Korean alpine town of Pyeongchang.

The countries also plan to send combined teams to the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. North Korea has yet to announce which city will join Seoul to bid for the 2032 Games, but experts say Pyongyang would be the obvious choice given its relatively advanced infrastructure. Officials described a jointly-hosted Olympics as an unprecedented opportunity for sports diplomacy to bring stability to the Korean peninsula. \u201cSeoul will cooperate with the national government so that the 2032 summer Olympics become something more than a sports festival \u2013 an opportunity to change the fate of the Korean peninsula,\u201d Seoul\u2019s mayor, Park Won-soon, said in a statement.

      "bodyText": "The trial of 12 Catalan separatist leaders in Madrid is of \u201cparamount importance to Spain\u2019s reputation as a modern democracy\u201d, the Spanish ambassador to London, Carlos Bastarreche, has said in a rare public intervention intended to convince the world the trial is not political. The ambassador, acting as part of a Europe-wide effort by the Madrid government, accused the pro-independence Catalan regional government of \u201ca massive campaign of disinformation\u201d and said the best way to fight back was with transparency. The trial of the 12, nine of whom are accused of rebellion, begins on Tuesday. Those accused of the most serious charges could face up to 25 years in jail. The intervention shows that the Spanish government is nervous the high-profile trial could turn the European public against it by seeking to use judicial methods to repress Catalan demands for independence. Officials from the highly active Catalan foreign ministry have already been to the UK to speak to MPs and claim that the proceedings, which could last as long as three months, amount to a political show trial. The Madrid government has launched a campaign entitled This is the Real Spain, highlighting the country\u2019s diversity, to counter the Catalan independence movement\u2019s claim that a politicised judiciary is repressing political opinion. Bastarreche said: \u201cThere is a real concern of the Spanish government because the image of Spain can be negatively effected by the campaign of disinformation, and it has been decided to put in place a response. \u201cWe are facing a very organised information campaign that is based on spreading fake news. The principal underlying message of our opponents is that Spain is not a democracy.\u201d The government is ensuring the trial is streamed live and is publishing factsheets about the independence of the Spanish judicial system to try to counter the Catalan narrative. Bastarreche acknowledged Spain had a unique challenge in explaining its case in the UK, where the Westminster parliament had permitted Scotland to hold an independence referendum. No such referendum has been granted by the Spanish parliament. He said: \u201cThere is a special difficulty to understand in this country what is happening in Spain. Britain is different and does not have a written constitution and no enshrinement of the unity of the country. That is a product of our history. The indissolubility of our country is one of the main principles of our country.\u201d He pointed to the demonstration in Madrid on Sunday objecting to the government\u2019s handling of the Catalan crisis as proof that diversity flourished in his country, just as Brexit had shown the range of opinion in the UK. \u201cSpain is one of the most solid democracies in the world, including one of the most protective judicial system as far as the defendants\u2019 rights are concerned,\u201d he said. A Catalan separatist narrative \u2013 pointing to lengthy detentions without trial, the heavy potential sentences, and the quality of the evidence that any of the accused agitated for violence \u2013 has largely shaped European opinion over the last year. Alfred Bosch, the Catalan foreign minister, said the Spanish government campaign showed that Madrid \u201cfeels fragile and uneasy. These trials will not defuse a crisis that needs to be defused by politics. \u201cIf the sentences are heavy \u2013 and the charges are heavy \u2013 it will create uproar in Catalonia, Spain and Europe. We are not acting on disinformation. \u201cIt is quite obvious in the 21st century in Europe either people decide on their own future, or there will be no permanent solution. The only violence that occurred during the referendum on 1 October was committed by the Spanish police, or Guardia Civil, and not by the Catalan government.\u201d Bosch claimed the lead judge in this case was a nationalist, and pointed to the way European courts have rejected Spanish government extradition requests for the Catalan leaders who fled the country after the Spanish government ruled the referendum unlawful. \u201cThe accused are not charged with stealing. They are charged as an autonomous government with holding an illegal referendum. This will affect the reputation of Spain for years to come. Ideas cannot be prosecuted,\u201d he said. The pro-independence government of the then Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, pressed ahead with the unilateral referendum in autumn 2017 even though polls consistently show Catalonia is evenly split over the independence issue, and pro-independence parties have never managed to win 50% of the vote in the regional parliament. According to the Catalan government, about 2.3 million of Catalonia\u2019s 5.3 million registered voters \u2013 43% \u2013 took part in the referendum, and about 90% of participants backed independence. The vote was largely boycotted by unionist Catalans.",

      "bodyText": "Glance at the food map of Spain, which crops up on children\u2019s jigsaw puzzles and teaching aids, and you\u2019ll find Valencia dotted with orange trees, La Rioja clumped with bottles of wine, and Castilla-La Mancha sitting under a heavy round of manchego. The Andaluc\u00edan province of Huelva, which borders the sherrylands of Jerez, is marked with a leg of Iberian ham \u2013 and an enormous strawberry that represents a billion-euro export market. The fruit might almost be to scale. More than 85% of all the strawberries Spain exports are grown in the province and much of Huelva\u2019s countryside sits under huge plastic tunnels over which hovers the occasional raptor. Also keeping a beady eye on the fields \u2013 and the very near future \u2013 is Jos\u00e9 Antonio Mart\u00edn. Like his great-grandfather, grandfather and father, Mart\u00edn is a farmer. The family business, AgroMart\u00edn, began with a single hectare of strawberries planted by his mother and father in 1980. It now comprises 140 hectares (350 acres) of strawberries and almost 200 hectares of nectarines, peaches, apricots and plums. As his 8,000 tonnes of strawberries ripen, Mart\u00edn ponders what Brexit will mean for his business. Around 15% percent of his strawberries are exported to the UK; the rest go elsewhere around the EU and to Norway and Switzerland. Last year, soft fruit exports from Huelva alone were worth \u20ac994m. Whatever happens, however, Mart\u00edn knows that Brexit will have a negative impact on free trade and increase the administrative burden. \u201cHow Brexit will affect us depends on the deal that\u2019s agreed between the Europe and the UK,\u201d he says. \u201cIf there\u2019s a deal, the main problem will be customs and getting all the right paperwork as each load will need to clear customs. \u201cAt the moment, though, we don\u2019t know and there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty. If there\u2019s no deal and a hard Brexit, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with border agreements.\u201d The 36-year-old farmer hopes a deal will be reached, as border restrictions would be be terrible for both the UK and the EU. If growers such as him have trouble exporting soft fruit to the UK, says Mart\u00edn, the consequences will be felt across the sector \u2013 and by both exporters and non-exporters. \u201cAt the moment, the strawberry, raspberry and blackberry markets are stable and the blueberry market has grown a bit,\u201d he says. \u201cSupply and demand are pretty well balanced in the market right now. A hard Brexit and a border closing could trigger an important crisis over its initial years. We could have a couple of difficult years that could even mean we have to reduce our crop hectarage a bit to adapt our supply to the demand all over again.\u201d In other words, the surplus resulting from the closed UK market would upset the balance, drive prices down and force farmers to rethink their planting. \u201cThat would be keenly felt in the early years \u2013 and especially at this time of the year. April and May are the busiest time of year for us. We may have to scale back planting next year, depending on what happens. This is a pretty uncertain time and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for anyone. It weakens the EU as a whole.\u201d According to Freshuelva, the industry association for Huelva\u2019s strawberry producers and distributors, the UK is the third biggest export market for strawberries after Germany and France and the biggest for raspberry exports. Sixteen percent of Huelva\u2019s strawberries ended up in the UK in 2018, as did 34% of its raspberries and 26% of its blueberries. \u201cBrexit is obviously generating uncertainty as the UK has traditionally been our second biggest market,\u201d says Freshuelva\u2019s manager, Rafael Dom\u00ednguez. \u201cBut what\u2019s really worrying us is not the controls themselves, but the border hold-ups when it comes to produce as perishable as berries.\u201d Dom\u00ednguez says the sector is planning for a no-deal Brexit, with all the stress and paperwork \u2013 tariff rights, customs declarations and phytosanitary certificates \u2013 that a UK crash-out would bring. \u201cThe imposition of customs and phytosanitary controls on exports of produce to the UK would affect transport logistics, slowing down or blocking access to the British market. Paying tariffs, meanwhile, would do serious economic damage and affect the competitiveness of our exports.\u201d All in all, adds Dom\u00ednguez, \u201cthe economic consequences would be extremely serious\u201d. Mart\u00edn, who has worked the land since he was a young boy, says Brexit\u2019s ripples will be felt well beyond the strawberry fields of Huelva. Agromart\u00edn employs around 400 people, but at peak harvest time, that figure can rise to 1,500 or 1,600. \u201cStrawberries move a lot of money and employ a lot of people,\u201d he says. \u201cAt harvest times, a lot of Bulgarians, Romanians and Moroccans come to work. A surplus and lower prices could affect employment. Strawberries are one of Huelva\u2019s flagship products.\u201d FACTBOX Total value of soft fruit exports from Huelva, Jan-Oct 2018: \u20ac994m Total value of Huelva\u2019s strawberry exports in 2018: \u20ac437m Total area of strawberry cultivation in Huelva: 6,095 hectares (15,052 acres) Total value of Spanish strawberry exports in 2018: \u20ac580m Biggest markets for Huelva soft fruit: Germany (31%), UK (26%) and France (10.9%) (Sources: Andaluc\u00edan regional government; Spanish federation of associations of producers and exporters of fruits, vegetables and live plants; Freshuelva.)",

First, the behaviors this President routinely engages in are not going to change. He is who he is. Second, the pretty smiles and calm demeanors the other side will probably work through the media to contrast with the President will not hide the fact they think children can be killed at birth, Christians should be removed from policy making positions, and the economy should be bankrupted to implement environmental policies that will not actually mitigate climate change.</p> \n   <p>My friends in the center-right coalition who are flirting with Democrats are, more often than not, not really socially conservative. But I am. That party offers me no home and is deeply hostile to people of faith. The President has shown himself to not share my faith convictions any more than the other side, but the President has shown he is willing to defend my faith convictions and is supportive of them.</p> \n   <p>I could stay home or vote third party as I did in 2016. But what will that get me? The ability to say \u201cnot my problem\u201d or the self-assurance that I didn\u2019t get dirty in having to choose? I have many Christian friends who, when I have discussed this, tell me I should just stay home and turn my back. Both parties, they tell me, are profoundly corrupt. And they\u2019re right. But I am not looking for a messiah in politics and don\u2019t have some religious sentiment tied to my vote. While I understand and accept the sincere conviction of some of my friends who have decided they will just sit out the process, I have decided otherwise. In 2016, we knew who the Democrats were and were not sure of who Donald Trump was. Now we know both and I prefer this President to the alternative.</p> \n   <p>I will vote for Donald Trump and Mike Pence. And, to be clear, it will not be just because of what the other side offers, but also because of what the Trump-Pence team has done.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for sticking with us through another eventful day. Democratic and Republican leaders reached an agreement to avoid another partial government shutdown, just days before the 15 February deadline. The deal would allocate far less money than what Trump asked for when it came to his border wall, but it would fund 55 miles of new fencing. President Trump and former Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke both held rallies in El Paso, Texas. Trump\u2019s speech felt more like a preview for the 2020 race than a push for a border wall, while O\u2019Rourke stayed on message in declaring that \u201cwalls do not make us safer.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Tom McCarthy has the details on the agreement reached by Democratic and Republican leaders late Monday to avoid another government shutdown: The agreement would allocate far less money for Trump\u2019s border wall than the White House\u2019s $5.7bn wish list, settling for a figure of nearly $1.4bn, according to congressional aides. The funding measure is through the fiscal year, which ends 30 September. The agreement means 55 miles of new fencing \u2014 constructed through existing designs such as metal slats instead of a concrete wall \u2014 but far less than the 215 miles the White House demanded in December. The fencing would be built in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. At a rally in El Paso, Texas, on Monday Trump said he had been informed about the committee\u2019s progress. \u201cJust so you know, we\u2019re building the wall anyway\u201d, he added. Read more here. At what was expected to be a border wall-focused event, President Trump energized his base over much more than just immigration. He took jabs at all the usual crowdpleasers at a Trump rally, drawing unified boos against the media, the Democrats, abortion, and, yes, Hillary Clinton. \u201cThe Democratic Party has never been so far out of the mainstream, he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve become the party of socialism, late-term abortions, open borders, and crime.\u201d As in many of his speeches, this one was filled with heavy boasting and factual inaccuracies. Trump made a point several times throughout his speech to pile on former Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, who was holding a counter-protest outside. Just as with his inauguration, he tossed a variety of different numbers in comparing attendance that were questionable and unconfirmed. Trump also poked fun at Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, who is currently under fire after admitting that he wore blackface as a young man. \u201cI like him,\u201d Trump said. \u201cKeeps us out of the paper.\u201d But of course, there were plenty of \u201cbuild the wall\u201d chants that brought the focus back to the border. Attendees in \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats sitting under giant signs reading \u201cFinish the Wall\u201d roared in approval when Trump wrongly asserted that construction on the wall had already begun - what has actually been built is just replacement fence. Trump also made a series of false statements about Ice arresting more than 200,000 migrants with criminal histories. He repeated his false statement on how the border fence has affected security in El Paso. He accurately talk about hundreds of thousands of immigration cases in backlog. Regardless of what the president said, the crowd loved every moment of the rally. \u201cIs there any place that\u2019s more fun to be than a Trump rally?\u201d President Trump asked the cheering crowd. The rally was interrupted at least twice, to which Trump twirled his fingers around his ears to signify that he thought whoever caused the disruption was crazy. \u201cWhere do they find these people?\u201d he said. President Trump began his address with his usual call for \u201cAmerica First\u201d and a boast about a 52% approval rating. \u201cDespite the fact that the media refuses to acknowledge what we\u2019ve done and how well we\u2019re doing it, a new poll just came out,\u201d he told the crowd, which booed the media and applauded the report of his approval rating. Trump shared the Rasmussen Report Daily Presidential Tracking Poll, which put Trump\u2019s approval rating at the highest it\u2019s been since \u201cshortly after his inauguration.\u201d He made sure to throw a dig at former Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, who was speaking outside at a counter-protest. Trump said that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s only claim to fame was losing an election to Senator Ted Cruz, while as president, he has won \u201cone for one\u201d for elections, meaning he won the first presidential campaign he ran. \u201cA young man who has very little going for himself except he has a great first name,\u201d Trump said of O\u2019Rourke. Beto O\u2019Rourke took the stage before President Trump, telling a lively crowd that \u201cwalls do not make us safer.\u201d \u201cWe, together, we are making a stand for the truth against lies and hate and ignorance and intolerance,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said to cheers and applause. \u201cWe are going to show the country who we are. A president who describes Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals, we have the chances to tell him and this country that immigrants commit crimes, including violent crimes, at a lower rate than Americans who are born in this country.\u201d The crowd erupted with cheers as Donald Trump Jr. made his way to the stage. The minute he reached the podium, he mocked the protest being led by former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke. He repeated his father\u2019s words from the State of the Union, saying, \u201cAmerica will never be a Socialist country,\u201d and was greeted with cheers and \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d chants. Trump Jr. also took the opportunity to go after the Democrats for the Green New Deal, \u201cthe witch hunt\u201d - a reference to the Mueller investigation - and the economic policies of the Obama administration. \u201cThe left hates Trump more than they love America,\u201d he said, energizing the crowd before his father\u2019s arrival. Negotiators in Congress say they have reached an agreement to fund the government, just days before the 15 February deadline of another partial government shutdown, the Associated Press is reporting. Officials say an agreement could be in sight as early as Monday night. The talks had cratered over the weekend because of Democratic demands to limit immigrant detentions by federal authorities, but that impasse seems to be loosening. A Friday midnight deadline is looming as negotiators strain to prevent a second partial government shutdown, for which there is virtually no support from lawmakers of either party. If bargainers don\u2019t reach an agreement and get President Donald Trump\u2019s signature by then, hundreds of thousands of federal workers will be furloughed for a second time this year. Senator John Cornyn was the first speaker to take the stage prior to President Trump\u2019s appearance tonight. Cornyn sought to get the crowd excited by thanking them for their support for Senator Ted Cruz during the midterm election in November and by making mention of the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Border Security requires of physical barriers, technology and \u201cboots on the ground\u201d, Cornyn told the crowd, and Trump is listening to Border Patrol instead of \u201cthe media and the far-left.\u201d Among other topics Cornyn referenced is the number of conservative judges confirmed to federal courts, and the tax cuts passed at the end of 2017. Every mention of the borer wall, tax cuts, and jobs received loud applause and cheers, while every mention of the Democrats and the media was met with boos. Cornyn asked the crowd to remain vigilant ahead of the 2020 presidential election. \u201cWe cannot get complacent,\u201d he said. \u201c(Senator) Chuck Schumer and (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi have their sights on Texas. I need your support next year. President Trump needs your support next year.\u201d With Beto O\u2019Rourke leading the counter-march to President Trump\u2019s rally in El Paso, Texas, there were plenty of raised eyebrows about what this bit of community organizing meant in terms of a potential 2020 presidential run. Many of his supporters at the march shouted and chanted for his candidacy, on which the former congressman said he\u2019s still undecided. But O\u2019Rourke seemed to deflect questions about his political future on Monday, choosing instead to focus on the issue at hand. The El Paso County Coliseum was quickly filling up for President Trump\u2019s first rally of 2019. Attendees filed into the arena under giant red-and-white signs reading, \u201cFinish the Wall.\u201d Shortly after the national anthem played, they began chanting, \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d Local Trump supporter Cody Perkins told the Guardian that he was he excited by the president\u2019s visit, Trump\u2019s first official visit to the city ever. He hoped that the main focus of the rally would be on immigration and the potential government shutdown over border wall funding. Meanwhile, a counter protest was taking place in the vicinity of the Coliseum. Organizers for both events have told attendees to respect those with different views and not to engage in any physical altercations. Rally organizers pre-recorded a message that stated that first amendment rights are a priority but emphasized the rally is a private event and protesters will be escorted out. With just a few hours to go before President Trump\u2019s rally in El Paso, protesters and supporters have gathered with signs and chants. As President Trump prepared to speak at the border Monday in another expected call for a wall to curtail illegal immigration, Governor Gavin Newsom defended his decision to withdraw national guardsmen from the California-Mexico border, saying that \u201cthis whole border issue is manufactured.\u201d \u201cThe crisis on the border is a manufactured crisis and we are not interested in participating in this political theater,\u201d Newsom said in a press conference. \u201cWe are living in a state and in a nation where people that are here without documentation commit crimes at a substantially lower level than native-born citizens. We have families that are crossing the border that are doing so legally through the asylum process. We have 550,000 people fewer without documentation in this state than we did a decade ago. \u201cThis is pure politics. Period. Full stop. The rest is frankly just a lot of misdirection and a waste of everybody\u2019s time. We\u2019re just not going to participate in it. We\u2019re not interested in perpetuating this.\u201d About 360 guardsmen are currently stationed at the border, though the number changes from day to day, Newsom said. He planned to leave 100 at the border to combat drug and guns trafficking, and redeploy the remaining 260 \u201cto more appropriate venues and to more appropriate purposes\u201d such as wildfire abatement. Cliff Sims, the former White House communications aide who wrote a tell-all about life working for President Trump, is suing the president, alleging that he used his campaign organization to selectively enforce nondisclosure agreements to silence or punish former employees, the New York Times is reporting. Mr. Sims was a White House aide from the beginning of the administration. But it was the campaign organization that filed an arbitration claim against him last week, accusing him of violating the nondisclosure agreement he signed with it during the 2016 presidential race with the publication of his book, \u201cTeam of Vipers,\u201d last month. The White House had dozens of people sign such agreements at the beginning of the president\u2019s term. But those agreements are widely seen as likely unenforceable. In the suit, Mr. Sims says he does not recall whether he signed one when he came to the White House. Mr. Sims\u2019s lawsuit alleges that Mr. Trump \u201cis seeking to impose civil liability against Mr. Sims through application of NDAs that apply to information Mr. Sims learned solely during his federal service.\u201d Trump was unhappy with the book, just as he was with Omarosa Manigault Newman\u2019s tell-all - according to the New York Times, the lawsuit noted that he had attempted to enforce the nondisclosure agreement against her as well, but he did not do so against Sean Spicer, or Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, three former aides who wrote books that the president \u201cfound flattering and therefore not objectionable.\u201d Ahead of President Trump\u2019s rally in El Paso tonight, the county judge and commissioners court passed a resolution stating that the Trump administration has \u201cdisseminated false information to local officials across the nation regarding its perceived need for border security funding priorities.\u201d With all the attention on Representative Ilhan Omar\u2019s apology for comments that were by condemned House Democratic leaders as antisemitic, some have raised questions over why President Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are not being similarly taken to task by Republicans for making jokes about the Trail of Tears and genocide against Native Americans. Hey all, Vivian Ho on the west coast, taking over for Ben Jacobs. Buckle up - it\u2019s going to be long night with both President Trump and Beto O\u2019Rourke hosting rallies in El Paso. Representative Ilhan Omar issued an apology for comments that were widely condemned as antisemitic. CNN will host a town hall with Senator Amy Klobuchar next Monday in New Hampshire. Articles of impeachment will not be filed yet against Virginia lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax, who is facing two different allegations of sexual assault. Donald Trump will hold his first rally of 2019 later tonight in El Paso. Questions are being raised about a new MRE \u201cmeals ready to eat\u201d pack distributed to troops. The image on the front is said to look like a silhouette of Donald Trump sitting with Kanye West. The Iowa Democratic party has unveiled its new process for running the caucuses in 2020. There are some key changes including the addition of an absentee element to the caucuses. A number of staffers for Virginia lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax have resigned. Two of Fairfax\u2019s three staffers on government payroll as well as two staffers at his political action committee have moved on after the allegations of sexual assault against Fairfax. Former Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen has postponed his appearance before the Senate intelligence committee Tuesday for medical reasons. Congressional negotiators are meeting today in an effort to salvage a deal to keep the federal government open. Fights on immigration policy have imperiled the prospect of a deal that would avoid second partial government shutdown. As Politico notes: The confab carries with it significant urgency: Negotiators have hoped to post compromise legislation that funds the government and gives President Donald Trump new money for border security by Monday evening to meet the House Democratic majority\u2019s new rules and allow passage of the legislation through the Senate by Friday evening, the new shutdown deadline. New York governor Andrew Cuomo is going to Washington DC on Tuesday to meet with Donald Trump about reinstating state and local income tax deductibility for federal income tax. The 2017 Republican tax cut bill capped the deduction at $10,000 which had a major impact on residents of high tax states like New York. Ilhan Omar has now issued an apology for her tweets last night which have been almost universally condemned as antisemitic. A Democratic Super Pac has filed an FEC complaint against billionaire Howard Schultz. The Huffington Post reports: American Bridge 21st Century \u2013 which primarily focuses on obtaining opposition research on Republicans \u2013 argues in its complaint that Schultz is pushing the limits of an exemption in the Federal Election Campaign Act that allows potential candidates to \u201ctest the waters\u201d before officially deciding to run for office, during which time they adhere to less stringent election rules. The complaint has been sent but not yet officially received by the FEC. \u201cMr Schultz cannot continue to skirt the Act\u2019s disclosure requirements by publicly stating that he has not made a final decision regarding his candidacy if such a decision has already been made,\u201d the complaint reads. Schultz has become anathema for Democrats since he started floating a third-party presidential bid which they fear would divide the anti-Trump vote and give an opportunity for Trump to win re-election. In other news today in Virginia, the House of Delegates just voted to raise the age to buy cigarettes to 21. In a state where tobacco dominated the economy for three centuries, it represents a major shift. Both Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar and California senator Kamala Harris consulted with Hillary Clinton before launching their presidential bids. The Daily Mail reports that Clinton had conversations with both women in recent weeks. California governor Gavin Newsom will withdraw national guardsmen deployed to the US-Mexico border and deploy them elsewhere. The California Democrat will shift 400 troops away from the border as Donald Trump escalates his rhetoric about illegal immigration and the need for a wall. Tulsi Gabbard is making her visit to Iowa today since launching her presidential campaign. The four-term Hawaii Democrat had a small crowd in Des Moines earlier today but has drawn a decent audience in far-left Fairfield, Iowa. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, along with the rest of Democratic leadership, has now condemned Ilhan Omar\u2019s allegedly antisemitic tweets. \u201cAnti-Semitism must be called out, confronted and condemned whenever it is encountered, without exception. \u201cWe are and will always be strong supporters of Israel in Congress because we understand that our support is based on shared values and strategic interests. Legitimate criticism of Israel\u2019s policies is protected by the values of free speech and democratic debate that the United States and Israel share. But Congresswoman Omar\u2019s use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel\u2019s supporters is deeply offensive. We condemn these remarks and we call upon Congresswoman Omar to immediately apologize for these hurtful comments. \u201cAs Democrats and as Americans, the entire Congress must be fully engaged in denouncing and rejecting all forms of hatred, racism, prejudice and discrimination wherever they are encountered.\u201d After being indicted last year for illegally spending campaign money for personal reasons, California Republican Duncan Hunter used campaign funds at an amusement park and also ran up disputed charges with a drone company. According to campaign finance records, Hunter\u2019s campaign spent over $100,000 in the last five weeks of 2018 including over $200 for \u201cfood/beverages\u201d at Belmont Park, an amusement park in his district. Florida senator Rick Scott will no longer put his wealth in a blind trust. Scott, a millionaire who previously served eight years as the state\u2019s governor, put wealth into a trust when taking office in Tallahassee. However, he\u2019s changing his stance now that the Republican has been elected to the Senate. CNN will host another town hall next week with Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. The three-term Democrat announced Sunday that she would be running for president. The town hall will take place next Monday in New Hampshire. It has previously hosted town halls with Senator Kamala Harris and coffee mogul Howard Schultz. Justin Fairfax has taken a leave of absence from his job as a lawyer for the prominent firm of Morrison Foerster. The leave comes as the firm investigates allegations of sexual assault against Fairfax, the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia. His official position is only a part time job and those holding it often have outside sources of income. Kamala Harris endorsed marijuana legalization in an interview on Monday. The Democratic senator from California became the latest 2020 presidential candidate to call for legalization, saying \u201clisten, I think it gives a lot of people joy. And we need more joy.\u201d Former Republican strategist Steve Schmidt stormed off a podcast last week when asked about his work consulting for Howard Schultz. Schmidt, a top advisor to John McCain\u2019s 2008 campaign who left the GOP in reaction to Donald Trump, reacted angrily when pressed about his work for Schultz who is contemplating a third party run and whether the Starbucks mogul would serve as a spoiler to re-elect Trump. In her presidential announcement yesterday, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar took a tough stance on big tech companies. As the Washington Post reports: Klobuchar\u2019s decision to make privacy and Internet connectivity a central focus of her campaign could elevate tech policy issues during the Democratic primary. By touting these issues during her first major speech as a 2020 contender, Klobuchar is making a big bet that privacy and other digital concerns are increasingly important to American voters. It\u2019s especially striking since tech policy is not generally an issue that drives voters\u2019 feet to the polls. In a survey about voter priorities ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, Gallup listed health care, the economy and immigration as the top concerns among voters. Technology wasn\u2019t even included in the 12 issues on the list. Yet if Klobuchar shows Democratic voters \u2014 especially key demographics like millennials \u2014 are paying attention, other politicians may start to prioritize issues like privacy and net neutrality in campaigns. \u201cWay too many politicians have their heads stuck in the sand when it comes to the digital revolution,\u201d she said. \u201cHey guys, it\u2019s not just coming, it\u2019s here. And if you don\u2019t know the difference between a hack and Slack, it\u2019s time to pull off the digital highway.\u201d A wave of Democrats have condemned Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar\u2019s use of allegedly antisemitic tropes yet again on Twitter. Prominent never-Trumper Erick Erickson announced today that he would back Trump\u2019s re-election bid. An ardent conservative, Erickson was motivated in part by character concerns about Trump in deciding not to vote for him in 2016 but he has changed his tune. As he writes on The Resurgent: At this point I can head into 2020 knowing several things. First, the behaviors this President routinely engages in are not going to change. He is who he is. Second, the pretty smiles and calm demeanors the other side will probably work through the media to contrast with the President will not hide the fact they think children can be killed at birth, Christians should be removed from policy making positions, and the economy should be bankrupted to implement environmental policies that will not actually mitigate climate change. My friends in the center-right coalition who are flirting with Democrats are, more often than not, not really socially conservative. But I am. That party offers me no home and is deeply hostile to people of faith. The President has shown himself to not share my faith convictions any more than the other side, but the President has shown he is willing to defend my faith convictions and is supportive of them. I could stay home or vote third party as I did in 2016. But what will that get me? The ability to say \u201cnot my problem\u201d or the self-assurance that I didn\u2019t get dirty in having to choose? I have many Christian friends who, when I have discussed this, tell me I should just stay home and turn my back. Both parties, they tell me, are profoundly corrupt. And they\u2019re right. But I am not looking for a messiah in politics and don\u2019t have some religious sentiment tied to my vote. While I understand and accept the sincere conviction of some of my friends who have decided they will just sit out the process, I have decided otherwise. In 2016, we knew who the Democrats were and were not sure of who Donald Trump was. Now we know both and I prefer this President to the alternative. I will vote for Donald Trump and Mike Pence. And, to be clear, it will not be just because of what the other side offers, but also because of what the Trump-Pence team has done. They\u2019ve earned my vote. Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan has also yet to rule out a presidential bid. Ryan, who represents a traditional Democratic stronghold in Ohio\u2019s Mahoning Valley that shifted heavily towards Trump in 2016, is making visits to both Iowa and New Hampshire in the coming weeks. The Ohio Democrat, who challenged Nancy Pelosi to be the Democratic leader in the House in 2016, was first elected to Congress in 2002. Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts is still mulling over a presidential campaign. The three-term Democrat, who was a vocal critic of Nancy Pelosi and served in Iraq, told Buzzfeed: \u201cI\u2019m thinking about running for president. I\u2019m not definitely running, but I\u2019m going to take a very hard look at it. A very serious look at it. Because I believe it\u2019s time for a new generation of leadership, and we gotta send Donald Trump packing.\u201d Justin Fairfax, the Virginia Lieutenant Governor, will preside over the state senate on Monday. Despite a second allegation of sexual assault, the embattled Virginia Democrat will be back at work in the state capitol on Monday. Fairfax has maintained his innocence. The source who leaked Jeff Bezos\u2019s texts to the National Enquirer was the brother of his mistress, Lauren Sanchez. The Daily Beast reports Michael Sanchez, who has ties to a number of people in Donald Trump\u2019s orbit, was the source of the leaked messages. No one who spoke to The Daily Beast implied that Michael Sanchez in any way hacked his sister\u2019s phone, and he has not been charged with any crime. In fact, three people familiar with the Bezos-funded probe told The Daily Beast in late January that it had found no evidence of a hack. However, Bezos\u2019 investigators have strongly suspected Sanchez was the leaker since at least last week, according to two people familiar with the investigation. \u201cThere is no one inside this inquiry process who doesn\u2019t believe he\u2019s ground zero,\u201d one of those sources said. The Republican tax bill of 2017 is going to have a major impact on whether Americans receive refunds this year. Although the legislation cut taxes, it may have reduced tax refunds as well. The Washington Post reports: While the vast majority of Americans received a tax cut in 2018, refunds are a different matter. Some refunds have decreased because of changes in the law, such as a new limit on property and local income tax deductions, and some have decreased because of how the IRS has altered withholding in paychecks. The average tax refund check is down 8 percent ($170) this year compared to last, the IRS reported Friday, and the number of people receiving a refund so far has dropped by almost a quarter. Donald Trump has some advice for Democrats. Congressman Walter Jones died Sunday at the age of 76. The iconoclastic North Carolina Republican had been in hospice care. Although Jones started out his career on Capitol Hill in 1994, he took increasingly heterodox stances in the aftermath of the Iraq War. An initial supporter of the conflict, Jones led the effort to rename french fries as \u201cfreedom fries\u201d in Capitol Hill after France refused to join the U.S. led coalition in the conflict. However, he eventually became a vocal opponent of it and became a consistent gadfly to Republican leadership of a number of issues. The son of a longtime Democratic congressman, Jones was first elected to serve his coastal North Carolina district in 1994. Articles of impeachment will not be brought against Virginia lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax this morning. Delegate Patrick Hope, a Democrat from Northern Virginia, who initially promised to start the impeachment process today after Fairfax faced two allegations of sexual assault, is now holding back. Good morning, A government shutdown is less than a week away as congressional negotiators have reached an impasse, a Democratic member of Congress is facing heavy criticism after once again tweeting anti-Semitic tropes and Donald Trump is holding a rally in El Paso this evening. It\u2019s Monday in American politics.",

      "bodyText": "Hakeem al-Araibi arrived in Melbourne on Tuesday, 77 days after he was arrested in Thailand on an Interpol red notice, drawing global condemnation and a campaign to see him freed. The 25-year-old refugee walked through the gates to cheers and a waiting group of supporters wearing T-shirts emblazoned with his name, as well as a throng of media, friends and supporters. Al-Araibi, a Bahraini refugee who has lived in Australia for five years, was released from a Thai prison on Monday after 76 days of incarceration. The shock decision by the Thai government and courts to free him brought to an end Bahrain\u2019s attempts to have the dissident and athlete returned to them. Al-Araibi was swamped by his friends and team-mates before making a short statement. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see all of the people here and all of the Australian people and all of the media who supported me,\u201d said al-Araibi. \u201cAnd I just wanted to thank the Australian government, the Australian people.\u201d He stood next to former Socceroo Craig Foster, who spearheaded the campaign to free him. \u201cI want to thank this man who fight so much for my case,\u201d Al-Araibi said of Foster. \u201cI thank the media, all the human rights. Thank you. I will be more strong for this country and I will be strong here for Australia. This is my country. I didn\u2019t have citizenship yet, but my country is Australia. I love Australia.\u201d The crowd erupted into cheers and shouts of \u201cWelcome Home Hakeem\u201d, and \u201cIt\u2019s good to have you brother.\u201d Foster said there was an \u201camazing coalition\u201d of people around the world who worked to free Al-Araibi. He thanked prime minister Scott Morrison and foreign affairs minister Marise Payne, thanking Payne in particular for taking the issue personally and working \u201cincredibly hard\u201d. \u201cScott in recent times stepped up, particularly after so many athletes and Olympians asked him to take the issue personally, and he did so, and I thank him,\u201d said Foster. \u201cIt made a significant difference.\u201d Foster said they wouldn\u2019t stop until people were held accountable for the past three months. \u201cNevertheless, above all else, this is about a young man getting back to his wife,\u201d he said. Lou Tona, chairman of Al-Araibi\u2019s Melbourne football club, Pascoe Vale, told the Guardian he was overwhelmed, and he wanted Al-Araibi to know \u201cAustralia was right behind him\u201d. Tona said Al-Araibi was a quiet kid and unassuming personality but a lion on the field. \u201cWhen I walk in the change room I cop a lot of banter from all the boys. But he doesn\u2019t give me any,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he started now I\u2019d forgive him for it.\u201d The club\u2019s first game is on Thursday. Team-mate Davey Van\u2019t Schip said he couldn\u2019t wait to see Al-Araibi. \u201cI\u2019m going to give him a hug,\u201d Van\u2019t Schip said. Tona said Foster was a fearless leader \u201cwho kept us going\u201d. Tim O\u2019Connor from Amnesty International told Guardian Australia he was \u201cfeeling jubilant\u201d and it was a day of celebration. \u201cIt\u2019s so exciting to be here today to see Hakeem get off that plane,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cHe committed no crime \u2013 he was an innocent man caught up in a much bigger political game.\u201d Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of advocacy at the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, said: \u201cTwo moments captured the world\u2019s attention this month. The photo of footballer Hakeem al-Araibi shackled and barefoot, and the moment of Hakeem breaking the chains and reunited with his beloved wife, friends and the football community in Melbourne.\u201d His arrival in his home city came as family has thanked the international community for securing his release from potential extradition to Bahrain, a country he fled after he was imprisoned and tortured. In a statement provided to Guardian Australia, Al-Araibi\u2019s family said they were \u201cheartened\u201d to see pictures of his release, but urged the world not to turn away from those still unjustly detained in Bahrain. \u201cWe are heartened seeing our released son Hakeem Al-Araibi\u2019s picture; embracing freedom after more than two months,\u201d his mother and siblings said. \u201cNonetheless, this indescribable joy would be greater when Hakeem\u2019s detained acquaintances and compatriots are freed from Bahrain\u2019s prisons of persecution.\u201d Al-Araibi\u2019s wife, who has not wanted to be identified throughout the ordeal, told Guardian Australia she was thankful for everyone\u2019s support. Before his departure from Thailand she said she wanted him to get on the plane before she could believe he was being released. Al-Araibi was arrested on 27 November on an erroneously issued Interpol red notice, which should never have been granted to Bahrain under clear Interpol policies designed to protect refugees from refoulement. While Thailand has said Bahrain withdrew its extradition request, allowing it to petition the court for Al-Araibi\u2019s freedom, the Gulf state has maintained his guilt as well as its \u201cright to pursue all necessary legal actions against Mr Al-Araibi\u201d. Al-Araibi was sentenced to 10 years in jail in absentia for what has become a widely discredited vandalism conviction. The young footballer has said he was playing in a televised match around the time of the crime and could never have been there. He believes he was targeted amid a crackdown on athletes participating in pro-democracy protests. \u201cAs soon as our son reach (sic) Australia, we call upon the Bahraini authorities, which unlawfully treats Hakeem as a criminal despite his innocence, to drop all the fabricated charges, repeal the court\u2019s unfair verdict, acquit and apologise for the physical and psychological repercussion it inflicted upon Hakeem,\u201d his family said. Many dissidents remain imprisoned in Bahrain, where allegations and instances of mistreatment and torture have been repeatedly documented by human rights groups, and Al-Araibi\u2019s family said they were \u201cbitterly waiting for the world\u2019s attention\u201d. \u201cThose are imprisoned merely in retaliation for their pro-democracy demands. Their parents as well aspire to reunite with them soon,\u201d they said. \u201cThe outstanding fight for Hakeem\u2019s case has averred that the continuous and effective efforts would find their way towards success. \u201cWe and Hakeem thank you again for your effort and free stance and ask you not to forget the oppressed people and prisoners of Bahrain.\u201d The family thanked activists, media and human rights groups across the three nations involved and around the world who had \u201cincredibly, and in all possible means, supported us and Hakeem to achieve this release\u201d. \u201cOur special thanks to the Australian football community and Hakeem\u2019s colleagues; particularly to the former Australia international footballer Craig Foster, who has honestly put nothing before this appalling case and has never lost any chance but to save Hakeem. \u201cThank you from the bottom of our hearts, O great warrior.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The banking royal commission findings appear to have delivered a political fillip to Labor, with the opposition extending its lead over the Coalition 55% to 45% on the two-party-preferred measure. The new Guardian Essential poll, taken before Monday\u2019s major party brinkmanship on asylum seekers in the lead-up to the resumption of parliament, puts the government\u2019s primary vote on 34% and Labor\u2019s on 38%, and the independents\u2019 share of the vote has risen to 11%, up from 9%. The positive movement in Labor\u2019s direction follows a shift in favour of the Coalition in last week\u2019s survey. Last week Labor was ahead of the Morrison government on the two-party-preferred measure 52% to 48% \u2013 a shift within the margin of error from the last voter survey of last year, and one in mid-January that had Labor ahead 53% to 47%. The fallout from the banking royal commission, controversy over the Liberal Tim Wilson\u2019s use of a taxpayer-funded inquiry into Labor\u2019s policy on franking credits to leverage a partisan campaign, and an escalating political brawl about border protection dominated the news last week. Voters in the survey were asked a series of questions about the final recommendations of the banking royal commission delivered by Kenneth Hayne. The responses suggest people are impatient to see parliament move on the changes proposed by the royal commissioner, but are cynical about whether the process will deliver lasting improvements. Both Labor voters (63%) and Coalition voters (62%) say the current session of parliament should not conclude until the banking royal commission overhaul is dealt with. Labor and the crossbench have already signalled an attempt to extend the sitting calendar to ensure more time is given to banking reform. The government disagrees on the rationale that the Hayne response not be rushed, and it has sought to curtail the sitting program before the May election given that its minority status makes the chambers more difficult to manage. Parliament is only scheduled to sit for three weeks before Australians go to the polls after the budget. Australian voters are sceptical about whether the overhaul presaged by Hayne will transform culture in the financial services sector. A quarter of people surveyed doubt the process will make a real difference to the way banks will operate (25%) and just under half (47%), think it will only lead to minor changes. People aged between 35 and 54 were most likely to believe the status quo will prevail. People intending to vote for micro-parties or independents in the coming election are the most likely cohort to think there will be no change as a result of the Hayne report (37%). Major-party voters are more likely to trust their own side to deliver the Hayne findings faithfully, with 60% of Labor voters, and 56% of Coalition voters trusting their party to deliver. But more than a third of respondents (35%) say the colour of the incumbent government will make no difference to the outcome. Greens voters (45%) and minor-party/independent voters (58%) are most likely to think it will no make a difference if a Liberal or Labor government implements the changes. While Australians overwhelmingly want a more ethical banking sector, and believe that would be good for the economy (72%), they aren\u2019t holding their breath. An emphatic majority, 71%, think banks will always find a way to exploit their customers and more than half (54%) agree that the banks will find a way to block politicians from implementing any meaningful reform in the sector. Just under a third of Australians (31%) report they have considered moving their money away from bigger banks as a result of the revelations of the royal commission. There is some concern that restrictions on lending could hurt the economy. While 37% of Australians agree the economy would suffer owing to too-restrictive regulations, 28% disagree with this statement. Coalition voters were the cohort most likely to agree that restrictions on banks could damage the economy (46%). The Coalition resisted calling the royal commission for more than a year, and 39% of the survey believe the government never supported the inquiry and will do all it can to water down the recommendations. Men are more likely than women to hold that view (44% v 35%). People aged 55 and older were most likely to agree that banks would always find ways to exploit customers (78%) and the banks would find a way to block meaningful reform (63%).",

The entitlement is offered to individuals who own shares in a company in recognition of the tax on profits paid by that company.

The value of the franking credit is equivalent to the tax paid on the individual\u2019s share of the company profit before it was distributed as a dividend.</p>\n    <p>The rationale for the credit is to avoid double taxation.

      "bodyText": "Liberal MP Tim Wilson will be obliged to assess at least 97 parliamentary inquiry submissions containing text that he wrote himself. Wilson is the chair of the House economics committee, which is currently conducting an inquiry into Labor\u2019s proposal to end cash refunds for excess imputation credits. However, Wilson has also created and authorised a campaign website, stoptheretirementtax.com, which he has been directing people to if they want to speak or register to attend inquiry hearings. The website also allows people to make a submission to the inquiry with a suggested, pre-written submission against the Labor policy. Guardian Australia has conducted an analysis of the 998 submissions on the inquiry website to identify which submissions contained this pre-written text, which Wilson would then have to consider in his role as chair of the committee. Of the submissions that have been published, at least 97 contain some part of the text written by Wilson, while 92 contain almost all of the text. (Many of these contain extra information in addition to the pro forma text). This figure will almost certainly increase as more submissions are made public. Currently the inquiry website covers submissions up to December, with those from January and February yet to be added. When asked by Guardian Australia how he could assess submissions containing text that he himself had written, Wilson replied:\u201cAustralians choose to send in submissions because they agree with the content, and we should respect that decision. They are free to add their personal story, which should absolutely be considered as part of the inquiry.\u201d \u201cIf they send in a pro forma submission it is a statement they agree with and represents their view. As chair I must respect what people send in, not dismiss it.\u201d Wilson also suggested many more submissions had yet to be published. \u201cYou are only seeing a small number of submissions. The secretariat has been overwhelmed at the response from the public and hasn\u2019t been able to process them all,\u201d he said. But Labor used the analysis to renew a call on Wilson to resign. The Labor MP Matt Thistlethwaite said the reliance on pro forma submissions meant the committee\u2019s final report would be relying on evidence written by its own chair. \u201cThe pre-filled submissions from the Wilson website means significant portions of the submissions received by the committee are written by the chair of the committee himself,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the committee writes its report, it will be relying in large part on evidence written by the chair.\u201d \u201cTim Wilson must resign as chair of the House economics committee. If he does not, the prime minister must finally show some leadership and sack him\u201d The inquiry into Labor\u2019s franking credit policy has proved controversial, with Guardian Australia revealing that fund manager Geoff Wilson, an opponent of Labor\u2019s policy, partly funded the campaign website. The same website uses the government coat of arms. Tim Wilson is also distantly related to Geoff Wilson, and has shares in funds managed by Geoff Wilson\u2019s Wilson Asset Management. On Monday morning, Wilson appeared on Sky News to make a strident defence of his actions on the committee. He described Labor\u2019s police complaint about possible privacy breaches as \u201ccomplete rubbish\u201d and a \u201cgrubby, pathetic, sad smear campaign\u201d.

You have to protect the keeper. We have been here for years and it\u2019s still very difficult to explain that.\u201d</p> \n<p>The concession of the late goal added insult to injury for Ben\u00edtez, clearly still holding a grudge for the events at St James\u2019s where he believed Boly should have been dismissed for elbowing Ayoze P\u00e9rez in Wolves\u2019 penalty area. \u201cI think we have to be really disappointed with the way we concede in both games against this team,\u201d he added. \u201cAfter an elbow in the face of my player and a penalty not given and then we concede today, you can analyse it. But I\u2019m really disappointed to concede this way against a good team.\u201d</p> \n<p>Certainly Wolves refuse to admit when they are beaten.

      "bodyText": "Rafael Ben\u00edtez must hate it when the fourth official holds up the board for added time against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Just as Matt Doherty had headed a winner in the 94th minute at St James\u2019 Park in December, so Newcastle United were again undone by a last-gasp goal as Willy Boly headed in Adama Traor\u00e9\u2019s deep cross in the 95th. Boly was able to head beyond a flapping Martin Dubravka in an aerial duel at the back post but once Ben\u00edtez had moved beyond his disappointment, the Newcastle manager should still take great heart from the resolve his side displayed as Isaac Hayden\u2019s rare goal earned United the draw that lifts them a point above the relegation zone. Ben\u00edtez initially said his goalkeeper should have defended Traor\u00e9\u2019s high cross better before revealing his true feelings. \u201cIn England they don\u2019t understand the rules,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was already the 94th minute so you can say too many things that won\u2019t change what happened, like we couldn\u2019t change in the first game. I\u2019m obviously disappointed but very happy with the performance of the team.\u201d Asked to clarify if he believed the referee, Graham Scott, had made a mistake, he added: \u201cThe six-yard box is there to protect the keeper. You have to protect the keeper. We have been here for years and it\u2019s still very difficult to explain that.\u201d The concession of the late goal added insult to injury for Ben\u00edtez, clearly still holding a grudge for the events at St James\u2019s where he believed Boly should have been dismissed for elbowing Ayoze P\u00e9rez in Wolves\u2019 penalty area. \u201cI think we have to be really disappointed with the way we concede in both games against this team,\u201d he added. \u201cAfter an elbow in the face of my player and a penalty not given and then we concede today, you can analyse it. But I\u2019m really disappointed to concede this way against a good team.\u201d Certainly Wolves refuse to admit when they are beaten. They have now scored 14 goals after the 80th minute this thrilling season, six of those coming in added time. There is a resilience that comes with belief. \u201cYes that we have until the last minute,\u201d Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, the Wolves head coach, said. \u201cTill the last second the referee whistles to finish, we keep going. For that I am really pleased because it one of the things we must keep on doing, [showing] character and believing. We have had a lot of moments like this.\u201d Wolves may have been thwarted in their bid to chalk up a fourth successive top-flight victory for the first time since 1972 but refreshed by their warm-weather training trip to Marbella, they still strengthened their hold on seventh place in the Premier League and now turn their attention to the FA Cup fifth-round tie at Bristol City. The uneasy peace between Ben\u00edtez and the Newcastle United hierarchy could yet lead to happier times. Not only has the manager been able to find a formula that has also brought victories over Cardiff City and Manchester City, he has also been able to introduce a \u00a321m attacking presence and Miguel Almir\u00f3n came off the bench to applause almost as rapturous as that greeting Hayden\u2019s first goal since October 2017. Ben\u00edtez has made it plain that talk of his Newcastle future must wait till the summer. But at least a thaw seems to be in evidence. Wolves, with five wins from their previous seven games, were the dominant team in the first period, with Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, eight goals from his last 11 starts, doing everything but score.

Eleven minutes after the restart, it was a similar through ball that set up their goal. It is 16 months since Hayden last scored but when Boly was caught on his heels as Sch\u00e4r strode forward and played a pass down the inside-right channel, the midfielder showed no hesitation as he shot powerfully home at the near post, exposing Rui Patr\u00edcio\u2019s early decision to dive the other way.

      "bodyText": "The government is facing calls for a new regulator to protect consumers\u2019 access to cash, following several bank IT failures and thousands of cash machine and branch closures across the UK. The consumer group Which? said cash is still a necessity for more than 25 million people in the UK. It also noted the combined closures of cash machines and branches have left people struggling to pay for essential goods and services. The charity is campaigning for the creation of a regulator with sole responsibility for cash infrastructure, which ensures continued access to physical money. Jenni Allen, the managing director for Which? Money, said: \u201cWe have serious concerns that the alarming rate of cashpoint and bank branch closures risks leaving people facing an uphill battle to access the cash they rely on. \u201cCash is also a vital backup as fallible digital payments grow in popularity. So the government must appoint a regulator to oversee these changes and ensure no one is excluded and left struggling to go about their daily lives.\u201d About two-thirds of the UK\u2019s bank branches have closed in the past 30 years. Of these, about 3,300 have shut since 2015 alone. This has left one-fifth of households more than two miles from their nearest bank. Which? also published figures showing the UK lost nearly 3,000 cash machines in the six months to December, a rate of about 488 a month. This includes 250 free-to-use machines. Over the whole of 2018, 102 protected machines, which receive additional subsidies from major banks to help keep them running, closed in remote areas. Which? said that despite the rise in digital payments, there was still a \u201creal appetite\u201d for cash, with 73% of the population frequently using it to pay for goods and services. Cash machine withdrawals in London and the south-east fell by 8.5% and 7.7% respectively last year, but the decline has been more gradual in areas such as Northern Ireland, where the drop was 2.1%. The move away from cash in the north-west, Scotland and Wales has also been slower, at 3.3%. Although there has been a notable takeup in online banking, Which? highlighted that digital and card payments have been vulnerable to IT failures. \u201cRecent analysis has found that leading banks are suffering at least one major security or IT glitch per week, with outages of Visa payments and IT failures across a vast number of UK banks, including the prolonged issues at TSB, which have caused chaos for millions of customers,\u201d it said. \u201cWhich? is concerned that people will be left vulnerable without a non-digital payment alternative as access to cash declines across the UK.\u201d The Treasury select committee has launched an inquiry into banking IT failures, although evidence sessions are still pending. The government stopped short of supporting calls for a cash protection regulator and said the Payment Systems Regulator is already \u201cclosely monitoring developments within ATM provision\u201d. A Treasury spokesman said: \u201cTechnology has transformed banking for millions of people, making it easier and quicker to carry out financial transactions and pay for services. This is to be welcomed, but we also recognise the continued importance of cash, especially for more vulnerable people. \u201cWhile the decision to close bank branches is a commercial decision, we understand the impact it can have on communities. Banks must now give customers as much notice as possible when a branch is closing, and ensure they are made aware of the options they have locally to continue to access banking services.\u201d",
